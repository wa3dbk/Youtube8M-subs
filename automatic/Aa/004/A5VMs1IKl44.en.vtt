00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 Hello and welcome to the 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.520
 friendly owl and today it works 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.049
 not for the sake of egos 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.510
 but photoshop because I have 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.650
 namely now because of one 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:17.010
 question from a userin or a user 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.380
 in the photoshop cafÃ© the question found 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:24.000
 How can I make my hair blonde? 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.800
 dyeing and not for everyone 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.869
 Come along with what I'm doing please 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.090
 Again, watch the video of me that 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.540
 tutorial with frequency retouching 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.239
 technology where portrait corrects 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.090
 because the technology helps now 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.160
 coloring the hair as well and thus me 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.160
 because now enter on every detail 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.770
 if you have to ask somewhere 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.680
 then please, the video looks nice 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.329
 there is a lot more explained ok me 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.480
 have something prepared here 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.010
 I have a picture in brown hair 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.789
 and we want that now in the video 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:03.780
 it just blond like a picture cutout 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.790
 you get all these choices 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.010
 that could do the frame now 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.990
 of this video blow up but there are 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.180
 on the internet and also in photoshop cafe 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.540
 heaps of tutorials how to wait 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.460
 What is important is only you need 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.560
 a good mask with the hair nice 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.320
 are exempted so skin areas 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.909
 and everything that is not hair is not 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.950
 so am I affected have the 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.070
 The goal is that he is at the end 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.329
 from the tutorial the hair dyed blonde 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.189
 of course that's one now 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.409
 little blonde we can do that 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.630
 also change shades 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.540
 it is not in principle around that 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.070
 now to have one hundred percent but 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.590
 formally if you just look worse 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.750
 would would it be the hair color at 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.640
 I look good I read for 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.549
 Blond is not there really much 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.619
 this is not so much more 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.079
 whole and bright blonde but as I said 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.390
 you can vary how you do it 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:03.170
 I show you now, first of all 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:05.579
 we need two copies of the photo 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:10.320
 the middle copy will be with the 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:15.520
 Russian soft focus soft 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:16.870
 and so no more details here 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.180
 recognize what in but only 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.090
 color field more space left over there 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.300
 I say okay then I activate the 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.510
 overlying level again and do 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.770
 a picture calculation why why 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.770
 at least what I understood 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.930
 I'm still retouching in frequency 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.120
 times explained here is important we have 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.970
 then a gray salad where everyone 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.660
 details are still recognizable but 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.540
 colors are no longer there I say okay 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.010
 and this level has to be linear light 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.930
 be put and then ours sees 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.510
 bild in principle again as well as 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.060
 at the beginning 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.709
 and now to dye the hair blond 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.660
 You see, I have a group here 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:02.430
 I just put it on again 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:05.170
 for these two levels, a group and 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.390
 For the sake of simplicity, I am pulling myself 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.310
 now the mask from the upper group in 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.310
 the group pure can be for a group 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.840
 create a layer mask in photoshop 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.630
 that it will be interesting if you go to 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.610
 example things like here now 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.170
 several levels need several 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.510
 levels are based but then overall 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.450
 groped only for a partial area 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.890
 in addition to word as I said it would 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.850
 speak video now if i say now 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.390
 I'm still looking like I do 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.940
 get ready 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.030
 actually, not much has happened 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.519
 changed 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:43.209
 The trick of bleaching is now that 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:45.910
 we the level the color information 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.980
 contains simply courting 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.720
 It was such an idea in my head 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.150
 There were certainly other ideas 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.530
 How to make blond hair you can 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.510
 but also go to the hairdresser for 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.340
 Photoshop I found that now on the 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.290
 fast a very cool possibility 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.180
 different color variants 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.549
 to try out what I am doing now 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.970
 put an adjustment layer in between 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:09.100
 namely shade saturation with hue 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.049
 saturation you can also color that is 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.519
 this little tick here you see it 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:15.850
 has been here in the screen to the 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:17.840
 changed color and we are at 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.600
 shade here in the 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.990
 the orange red area and I go 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.030
 now just over here just one 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.830
 bit in the yellow area go that 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.630
 here again almost green me 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.400
 i am looking for color here now i am 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:35.240
 think that fits quite well 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.889
 and then I see here because blonde hair 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.270
 are generally rather lighter draw 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.940
 I'm here a bit now 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:45.410
 over biting or hue I like 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.850
 it should even be less dirty blond 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.949
 has been here before 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:53.350
 a bit more obvious plus let's say 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:55.550
 the blue zone is okay that and everything 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.710
 of course I can do mine now 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:01.630
 plane pallet back I can here 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:03.470
 I also want to say that level 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.990
 we do not get anything multiplied 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.479
 want to dodge here on bright colors 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.950
 For example , you can get golden again 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:11.870
 shimmering rhine is not that either 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:15.590
 what we want to lighten 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.210
 yes, in principle, there is no change 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.039
 I'll just leave that up now 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.440
 normal continue to brighten it no 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:23.210
 change but what we notice is that 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.250
 now here in this area where this 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.600
 hair are, first was so good my 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.400
 Mask I made here is 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.789
 not as good as me here you have to 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.010
 optimize a bit but what 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:36.680
 also stands out in comparison to the 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:39.560
 we have a previous picture 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.810
 a little bit lost the whole thing works 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.550
 not so keen and when I do that 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.690
 a bit sharper would like a copy 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.889
 I now my detail level again 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.930
 Incidentally, taxation makes one 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:53.389
 wonderful copy now is natural 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.370
 the sharpness too much again from team 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:57.530
 like ready blond hair we want too 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.120
 do not have and that's why I put 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.430
 now this level on each other 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.039
 copy and now I have the sharpness 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:07.430
 in principle, I enter that one again 

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:10.099
 Hide something like they are there 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.690
 not quite like that but here i can 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:13.240
 then of course a little bit too 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.620
 vary 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:19.789
 I can now here, too, the covering power 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.900
 from that level bit reduce and 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:23.020
 Everything looks a bit like that 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.250
 natural sowing is now in 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:28.039
 I would be natural dark blond now 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:30.050
 Just say and there could be one 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:30.860
 little experiment that if it's just 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.719
 it is about 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.550
 on the fast a new shade too 

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:37.280
 test then that is a variant 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.590
 to bleach quickly I hope you have 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.780
 have fun experimenting with it 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:44.000
 you can of course also here if 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.800
 you double- click on it all 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.120
 we try other hair colors 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.590
 for example with blue or 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.080
 pink 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:55.520
 have fun so I hope that you 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.680
 a little further brings quick and 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:01.060
 dirty but not always so bad 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.060
 have fun bye
