00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:00.140 
anivia is a bird that I find very

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.530 
anivia is a bird that I find very
complicated<00:06:00.920> to<00:06:01.100> play<00:06:01.340> all<00:06:01.580> around<00:06:01.610> in<00:06:02.270> every

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:02.540 
complicated to play all around in every

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.930 
complicated to play all around in every
stage<00:06:02.840> of<00:06:03.020> the<00:06:03.170> game<00:06:03.350> and<00:06:03.710> there<00:06:04.700> is<00:06:04.790> not

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940 
stage of the game and there is not

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.300 
stage of the game and there is not
because<00:06:05.330> she<00:06:05.540> has<00:06:05.660> bad<00:06:05.960> abilities<00:06:06.560> no<00:06:06.950> no<00:06:07.130> no

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
because she has bad abilities no no no

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.220 
because she has bad abilities no no no
it's<00:06:07.640> more<00:06:07.880> like<00:06:07.940> because<00:06:08.480> her<00:06:08.630> abilities<00:06:09.080> are

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:09.230 
it's more like because her abilities are

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.170 
it's more like because her abilities are
so<00:06:09.470> damn<00:06:09.680> you<00:06:09.950> it's<00:06:10.250> hard<00:06:10.520> to<00:06:10.580> keep<00:06:10.700> up<00:06:10.970> with

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
so damn you it's hard to keep up with

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.600 
so damn you it's hard to keep up with
things<00:06:11.450> that<00:06:11.750> being<00:06:12.650> said<00:06:12.920> her<00:06:13.190> abilities

frostbite once load is crazy as well the

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.500 
frostbite once load is crazy as well the
issue<00:06:24.920> however<00:06:25.280> is<00:06:25.670> that<00:06:25.700> her<00:06:26.000> first<00:06:26.330> ability

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:26.510 
issue however is that her first ability

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.960 
issue however is that her first ability
flash<00:06:27.080> frost<00:06:27.380> has<00:06:27.680> a<00:06:27.710> slow<00:06:28.040> missile<00:06:28.460> speed<00:06:28.790> and

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:28.970 
flash frost has a slow missile speed and

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.000 
flash frost has a slow missile speed and
can<00:06:29.150> be<00:06:29.300> hard<00:06:29.510> to<00:06:29.600> land<00:06:29.840> plus<00:06:30.470> her<00:06:30.650> second

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:34.960 
ability crystallize can block to enemy
approach<00:06:33.110> well<00:06:33.440> but<00:06:33.919> it<00:06:34.070> can<00:06:34.190> also<00:06:34.370> ruin<00:06:34.760> your

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:34.970 
approach well but it can also ruin your

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:36.850 
approach well but it can also ruin your
allies<00:06:35.270> position<00:06:35.780> and<00:06:35.960> even<00:06:36.200> lead<00:06:36.410> them<00:06:36.680> to

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:36.860 
allies position and even lead them to
