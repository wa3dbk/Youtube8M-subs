00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.980
 my name is just me padilla in the 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.600
 present video report I'm going to 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.250
 talk about the rate the samples 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.989
 a disease maybe for many 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.989
 unknown accompanies 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.149
 toxoplasmosis is an infection 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.160
 caused by a parasite called 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:50.600
 toxoplasma gondii this parasite can 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.120
 grow in the tissues of some 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.769
 animals however only produces or 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.989
 cysts of eggs in the cells that 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.790
 lining the intestine of the cats 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.040
 which answers can be developed 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.989
 released and can survive up to 18 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.720
 months on earth toxoplasmosis 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.310
 has worldwide distribution in many 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.170
 areas of the planet the population 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.360
 exporter the parasite and not even what 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.310
 You know this is because for most of 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.590
 people with a healthy immune system 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.479
 the disease turns out to be asymptomatic 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.759
 most times and if the symptoms 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.110
 are present usually resolved in 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.899
 less than a year and does not affect 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.090
 Absolute the serious illness comes 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:27.380
 usually only in pregnancy and in 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.409
 patients with immune system 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.210
 weakened in patients with system 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.690
 immunological weakened toxoplasmosis 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:39.350
 usually compromises the brain the heart 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.030
 the liver the lung and the eye is one of 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.890
 The most common causes of the cornea 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.440
 retinitis that presents with pain 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.690
 ocular and loss of visual acuity and 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.070
 In some cases toxoplasmosis is usually 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.960
 get to cause 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.700
 this is because the patients none 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.409
 poor do not have defenses 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.600
 necessary for the parasite to 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.000
 be content and this can attack free 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.650
 medium in pregnant women the 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.660
 infection acquires the fetus by means of 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.000
 the hand is called toxoplasmosis 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.400
 congenital the severity with which the 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.740
 assessed if the fetus is affected depends 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.080
 and varies according to the record that has been 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.760
 acquired the disease when the mother 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.070
 is contagious in the first trimester 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.540
 produce abortions when the mother 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.130
 it infects in the second and third 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.830
 quarter the baby can be born with 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.660
 blindness psychomotor retardation can be 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.610
 produce epilepsy or you can be born with 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.460
 microcephaly that is when the head 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.680
 small means of transmission are born 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.720
 eat undercooked meat that has or 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.400
 cysts that are the eggs which are not 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.040
 will not be able to infect another animal 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.890
 or human being in the data affects that 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.900
 eat raw meat or almost eat 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.660
 fruits or vegetables contaminated with the 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.820
 stops or this happens when the land where 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.710
 have been cultivated is contaminated with 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.350
 the cysts and they are not enough 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:55.110
 washed or cooked contact was the 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.820
 direct with cat excrement with a 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.620
 person does not wash his hands well 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:02.550
 after cleaning the cat's sandbox 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:05.280
 touch contaminated earth etc 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.780
 Fetal infection if the mother is infected 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.880
 during a specific stage of 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.070
 pregnancy toxoplasma is transmitted by 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.230
 half of the placenta to the fetus by 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.210
 organ transplantation is the means of 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.010
 less common transmission since today in 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.780
 All kinds of studies are carried out 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.040
 to know if the blood is contaminated 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.810
 with him compared if it makes you a 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.810
 disease symptoms 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.940
 with immune systems 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.300
 and to what extent parents 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.940
 very good initially is passed as a 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.590
 four taps 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:42.910
 affectation something that fits 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:46.000
 being general and presence of ganglia 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.519
 in the neck is what directs towards the 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.349
 work in patients with system 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.510
 immune deficient symptoms 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:54.400
 depend on the site of the infection 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.110
 parasite attacks the patient's brain 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.780
 shows weakness on one side of the body 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.750
 difficulty speaking confusion and 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.950
 convulsions in toxoplasmosis 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.260
 Acute disseminated can present 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.470
 skin rashes high fever 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:11.470
 chills breathing difficulties and 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.599
 tiredness in pregnancy the symptoms 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.160
 they are almost imperceptible can 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:17.609
 swelling of the lymph nodes 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.820
 Neck Fever Sore Throat 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:24.000
 muscle aches and fatigue 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.460
 preventive measures cook well the 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.780
 meat before consuming the various 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.780
 fruits and vegetables before consuming them 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:41.099
 sometimes they are wormed but the 

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:41.099
 problem is that they are hunters 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:48.779
 to house a house a mosquito or house of 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.460
 another type of vector that can transmit 

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:53.180
 generate like that for example we had 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.180
 an hour ago 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.440
 miles allows perhaps more known of 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:08.080
 this disease is that all cats 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.639
 the truth is that a cat alone 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.280
 can become infected if he is a hunter 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.870
 even meat cross indeed the 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.490
 main means of transmission of 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.220
 this disease are food 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.440
 contaminated like poorly cooked meat or 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.120
 fruits and vegetables poorly washed many 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.160
 people also believe that if a woman 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.780
 it gets infected with the parasite about five 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.000
 years for example before staying 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.460
 Pregnant woman could have problems 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.410
 during the gestation period this is 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.240
 false mainly because if the woman 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.070
 is infected with the parasite and is not in 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.960
 gestation period your system 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.090
 immune will create defenses for the 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.789
 parasite immediately and this will not be 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.199
 able to attack the bottom my project does not 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:46.479
 has been created a negative environment 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:48.729
 with respect to the data but rather 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:51.160
 generate awareness about the care of 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:52.990
 these, since by donating at home they are 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.850
 our responsibility 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.770
 this was good with all common have 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:06:00.150
 enough and not so well-known in favor of 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.150
 health and social welfare
