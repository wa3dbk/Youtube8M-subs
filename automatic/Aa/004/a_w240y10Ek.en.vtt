00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
about just by watching the mysterious

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.880 
about just by watching the mysterious
1332<00:00:59.489> number<00:01:00.059> now<00:01:00.510> it's<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:01.020> bad<00:01:01.170> example<00:01:01.350> so

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
1332 number now it's a bad example so

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.170 
1332 number now it's a bad example so
the<00:01:02.340> good<00:01:02.550> example<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.120> URL<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:04.080> this<00:01:04.710> one<00:01:05.180> now

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
the good example of URL is this one now

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.420 
the good example of URL is this one now
we<00:01:06.240> go<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.450> tech<00:01:06.750> ridge<00:01:06.780> com<00:01:07.470> then<00:01:07.920> we<00:01:08.070> move<00:01:08.250> to

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
we go to tech ridge com then we move to

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.730 
we go to tech ridge com then we move to
the<00:01:08.460> folder<00:01:08.880> called<00:01:09.119> mobile<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.930> by<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.350> we

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
the folder called mobile and by that we

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.500 
the folder called mobile and by that we
can<00:01:10.890> at<00:01:11.040> least<00:01:11.220> assume<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.060> pages

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
can at least assume that the pages

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.330 
can at least assume that the pages
something<00:01:13.020> regarding<00:01:13.500> with<00:01:13.680> mobile<00:01:14.070> web

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
something regarding with mobile web

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.310 
something regarding with mobile web
development<00:01:14.369> or<00:01:15.000> something<00:01:15.299> like<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.479> then

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
development or something like that then

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.920 
development or something like that then
we<00:01:16.439> see<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.710> file<00:01:16.920> name<00:01:17.159> mobile<00:01:17.610> web<00:01:17.909> by<00:01:18.689> which

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
we see the file name mobile web by which

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.330 
we see the file name mobile web by which
we<00:01:19.110> can<00:01:19.140> assume<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.799> page<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.009> about

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
we can assume that the page is about

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.429 
we can assume that the page is about
creating<00:01:20.729> mobile<00:01:20.970> web<00:01:21.390> applications<00:01:22.200> or

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
creating mobile web applications or

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.100 
creating mobile web applications or
similar<00:01:22.950> like<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:24.210> it's<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.509> good<00:01:24.659> example

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
similar like that so it's a good example

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.770 
similar like that so it's a good example
now<00:01:25.439> remember<00:01:25.880> URL<00:01:26.880> must<00:01:27.119> be<00:01:27.270> short<00:01:27.600> and

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
now remember URL must be short and

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.370 
now remember URL must be short and
always<00:01:28.229> describe<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.040> page<00:01:29.250> properly<00:01:29.909> if

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
always describe the page properly if

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.719 
always describe the page properly if
