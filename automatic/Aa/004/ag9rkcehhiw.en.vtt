00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
way to do it so once I have set the

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.049 
way to do it so once I have set the
Machine<00:01:01.870> up<00:01:01.899> I<00:01:02.260> am<00:01:02.680> guaranteed<00:01:03.430> not<00:01:03.880> to

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
Machine up I am guaranteed not to

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.570 
Machine up I am guaranteed not to
accidentally<00:01:04.860> overstep<00:01:05.860> the<00:01:06.040> boundaries<00:01:06.460> of

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
accidentally overstep the boundaries of

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.219 
accidentally overstep the boundaries of
the<00:01:06.909> foot<00:01:07.180> that's<00:01:07.450> why<00:01:07.600> we<00:01:07.750> want<00:01:07.930> to<00:01:07.990> set<00:01:08.200> that

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
the foot that's why we want to set that

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:10.320 
the foot that's why we want to set that
twin<00:01:08.650> needle<00:01:08.830> function<00:01:09.430> because<00:01:10.060> what<00:01:10.240> it

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
twin needle function because what it

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.690 
twin needle function because what it
does<00:01:10.510> is<00:01:10.659> limits<00:01:11.229> the<00:01:11.440> set<00:01:11.740> the<00:01:12.100> setting<00:01:12.520> so

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
does is limits the set the setting so

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.880 
does is limits the set the setting so
right<00:01:12.880> now<00:01:13.030> where<00:01:13.180> it<00:01:13.240> says<00:01:13.300> 4.5<00:01:14.229> on<00:01:14.500> this<00:01:14.710> I

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
right now where it says 4.5 on this I

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.740 
right now where it says 4.5 on this I
cannot<00:01:15.580> make<00:01:15.880> it<00:01:15.940> any<00:01:16.300> bigger

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
cannot make it any bigger

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.070 
cannot make it any bigger
remember<00:01:17.409> the<00:01:17.530> max<00:01:17.770> is<00:01:18.010> 7<00:01:18.640> millimeters<00:01:19.120> -<00:01:19.900> two

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
remember the max is 7 millimeters - two

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.440 
remember the max is 7 millimeters - two
and<00:01:20.200> a<00:01:20.290> half<00:01:20.500> is<00:01:20.860> actually<00:01:21.310> four<00:01:22.150> and<00:01:22.270> a<00:01:22.299> half

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
and a half is actually four and a half

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.780 
and a half is actually four and a half
now<00:01:22.900> when<00:01:23.440> we<00:01:23.590> threaded<00:01:23.979> this<00:01:24.100> machine<00:01:24.549> I

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790
