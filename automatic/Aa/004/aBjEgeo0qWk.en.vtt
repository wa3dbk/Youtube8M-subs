00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.429 
be comfortable so I think it's nice to
dress<00:01:36.240> up<00:01:36.360> an<00:01:36.450> outfit<00:01:36.720> with<00:01:36.750> jewelry<00:01:37.170> but<00:01:37.320> if

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
you feel like it's gonna make you

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.859 
you feel like it's gonna make you
uncomfortable<00:01:38.579> or<00:01:39.030> it's<00:01:39.180> gonna<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.840> know

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
uncomfortable or it's gonna you know

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.569 
uncomfortable or it's gonna you know

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
there and then on the inside it has a

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.420 
there and then on the inside it has a
little<00:02:53.090> extra<00:02:53.690> pocket<00:02:53.959> so<00:02:54.410> I<00:02:54.440> can<00:02:54.680> hold<00:02:54.920> some

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430

stuff<00:02:55.670> in<00:02:55.880> there<00:02:56.120> and<00:02:56.390> then<00:02:56.840> it's<00:02:57.020> big<00:02:57.230> enough

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
stuff in there and then it's big enough

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.900 
stuff in there and then it's big enough
that<00:02:57.650> I<00:02:57.739> could<00:02:57.800> put<00:02:58.040> my<00:02:58.130> wallet<00:02:58.400> in<00:02:58.640> here<00:02:58.760> and

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
that I could put my wallet in here and

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.790 
that I could put my wallet in here and
everything<00:02:59.120> in<00:02:59.360> here<00:02:59.630> and<00:02:59.840> carry<00:03:00.530> it<00:03:00.709> around

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
everything in here and carry it around

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.280 
everything in here and carry it around
really<00:03:01.130> nicely<00:03:01.430> and<00:03:01.790> then<00:03:02.209> it<00:03:02.480> adjusts<00:03:02.720> so<00:03:03.200> I

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
really nicely and then it adjusts so I
