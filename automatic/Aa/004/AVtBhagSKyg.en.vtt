right now I haven't seen the ability to
switch<00:01:32.040> other<00:01:32.310> than<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.610> character<00:01:32.909> that

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970

switch other than the character that
I've<00:01:33.150> equipped<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:33.689> if<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:33.930> pick<00:01:34.200> Luffy<00:01:34.560> for

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
I've equipped so if you pick Luffy for

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.289 
I've equipped so if you pick Luffy for
example<00:01:35.040> then<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.460> have<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.640> gumgum<00:01:35.820> rifle

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
example then you have the gumgum rifle

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.240 
example then you have the gumgum rifle
you<00:01:36.390> press<00:01:36.630> r1<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:37.470> basically<00:01:38.009> every

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
you press r1 so basically every

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.830 
you press r1 so basically every
character<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.640> tied<00:01:38.820> down<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.390> one

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
character is tied down to that one

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.929 
character is tied down to that one
special<00:01:40.200> unique<00:01:40.470> move<00:01:40.680> as<00:01:41.520> far<00:01:41.700> as<00:01:41.790> music

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
special unique move as far as music

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.560 
special unique move as far as music
music<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:42.899> great<00:01:43.250> it's<00:01:44.250> not<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.820> same<00:01:45.299> music

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
music is great it's not the same music

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.480 
music is great it's not the same music
for<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.750> show<00:01:45.899> obviously<00:01:46.079> but<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:47.280> does

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
for the show obviously but it is it does

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.530 
for the show obviously but it is it does
sound<00:01:47.729> like<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:47.909> could<00:01:48.060> be<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.149> part<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.360> one

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
sound like it could be a part of one

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.179 
sound like it could be a part of one
piece<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.049> music<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.380> definitely<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.740> one<00:01:49.979> I

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
piece so the music is definitely a one I

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.639 
piece so the music is definitely a one I
probably<00:01:51.060> say<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.570> one<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.229> best<00:01:52.350> parts<00:01:52.560> of

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
probably say the one the best parts of

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.609 
probably say the one the best parts of
game<00:01:52.770> now<00:01:53.250> visuals<00:01:53.790> visuals<00:01:54.479> are<00:01:54.750> kind<00:01:55.350> of

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
game now visuals visuals are kind of

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.590 
game now visuals visuals are kind of
loped<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.070> down<00:01:56.219> there<00:01:57.149> are<00:01:57.210> certain<00:01:57.450> points

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
loped and down there are certain points

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.850 
loped and down there are certain points
where<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.869> game<00:01:57.990> looks<00:01:58.170> absolutely<00:01:58.320> glorious

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
where the game looks absolutely glorious

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.139 
where the game looks absolutely glorious
in<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.189> cutscenes<00:01:59.640> where<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.850> see<00:02:00.000> like

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
in the cutscenes where you see like

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.270 
in the cutscenes where you see like
Luffy<00:02:00.479> laying<00:02:00.990> into<00:02:01.380> his<00:02:01.469> enemies<00:02:01.799> but<00:02:02.159> then

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
Luffy laying into his enemies but then

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.410 
Luffy laying into his enemies but then
every<00:02:02.430> now<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.670> then<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.969> will<00:02:03.119> just<00:02:03.180> kind<00:02:03.390> of

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
every now and then it will just kind of

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.149 
every now and then it will just kind of
revert<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.960> where<00:02:04.229> it's<00:02:04.350> very<00:02:04.530> blocky<00:02:04.860> and

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
revert to where it's very blocky and

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.880 
revert to where it's very blocky and
just<00:02:05.340> like<00:02:05.430> what<00:02:06.149> am<00:02:06.450> i<00:02:06.659> playing

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
just like what am i playing

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.169 
just like what am i playing
and<00:02:08.190> obviously<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.520> just<00:02:08.729> goes<00:02:08.849> down<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.119> the

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
and obviously that just goes down to the

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.940 
and obviously that just goes down to the
fact<00:02:09.360> because<00:02:09.810> this<00:02:10.080> game<00:02:10.289> was<00:02:10.440> developed<00:02:10.830> for

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
fact because this game was developed for

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.140 
fact because this game was developed for
multiple<00:02:11.400> consoles<00:02:11.670> including

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
multiple consoles including

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.340 
multiple consoles including
old<00:02:12.300> gin<00:02:12.720> so

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
old gin so

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.350 
old gin so
oh I<00:02:13.440> feel<00:02:14.040> like<00:02:14.100> it<00:02:14.280> was<00:02:14.370> made<00:02:14.490> for<00:02:14.610> ps3<00:02:14.910> and

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
oh I feel like it was made for ps3 and

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.640 
oh I feel like it was made for ps3 and
then<00:02:15.540> it<00:02:15.660> got<00:02:15.750> kind<00:02:15.960> of<00:02:15.990> ported<00:02:16.320> over<00:02:16.380> to<00:02:16.530> the

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
then it got kind of ported over to the

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.980 
then it got kind of ported over to the
ps4<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:17.400> made<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.300> know<00:02:18.390> a<00:02:18.420> little<00:02:18.600> bit<00:02:18.690> nicer

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
ps4 and made you know a little bit nicer

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.540 
ps4 and made you know a little bit nicer
on<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.110> ps4<00:02:19.410> but<00:02:19.710> as<00:02:19.770> far<00:02:19.980> as<00:02:20.010> visuals<00:02:20.400> they're

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
on the ps4 but as far as visuals they're

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.490 
on the ps4 but as far as visuals they're
probably<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.880> weakest<00:02:21.300> part<00:02:21.480> of<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:22.110> game<00:02:22.140> I

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
probably the weakest part of the game I

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.680 
probably the weakest part of the game I
mean<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.980> doesn't<00:02:23.190> look<00:02:23.400> horrible<00:02:23.820> but<00:02:24.360> I<00:02:24.510> got

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
mean it doesn't look horrible but I got

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:25.760 
mean it doesn't look horrible but I got
said<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.840> certain<00:02:25.140> parts<00:02:25.380> of<00:02:25.410> game<00:02:25.560> but<00:02:25.710> you

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
said a certain parts of game but you

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.220 
said a certain parts of game but you
probably<00:02:25.980> see<00:02:26.130> in<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.550> video<00:02:26.760> right<00:02:26.790> now

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
probably see in the video right now

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.330 
probably see in the video right now
where<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.320> cutscenes<00:02:28.770> or<00:02:28.980> just<00:02:29.190> something

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
where the cutscenes or just something

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.400 
where the cutscenes or just something
will<00:02:29.550> look<00:02:29.670> very<00:02:29.910> blocky<00:02:30.210> or<00:02:30.570> just<00:02:30.750> like<00:02:30.930> the

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
will look very blocky or just like the

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.720 
will look very blocky or just like the
textures<00:02:31.770> just<00:02:31.800> don't<00:02:32.130> really<00:02:32.310> exist<00:02:32.610> but

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
textures just don't really exist but

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.360 
textures just don't really exist but
outside<00:02:33.120> that<00:02:33.360> it's<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.570> lot<00:02:33.720> of<00:02:33.870> fun<00:02:34.130> so<00:02:35.130> the

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
outside that it's a lot of fun so the

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.130 
outside that it's a lot of fun so the

much comments been playing the game I've
been<00:02:48.570> playing<00:02:48.690> pretty<00:02:49.140> much<00:02:49.260> non-stop<00:02:49.560> for

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
been playing pretty much non-stop for

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.520 
been playing pretty much non-stop for
last<00:02:50.190> let's<00:02:50.880> say<00:02:50.970> five<00:02:51.210> days<00:02:51.240> and<00:02:52.110> I<00:02:52.170> can't<00:02:52.410> put

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
last let's say five days and I can't put

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.230 
last let's say five days and I can't put
it<00:02:52.620> down<00:02:52.770> it's<00:02:53.250> weird<00:02:53.490> because<00:02:53.610> usually<00:02:54.000> we

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
it down it's weird because usually we

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.520 
it down it's weird because usually we
don't<00:02:54.420> see<00:02:54.540> where's<00:02:54.750> games<00:02:55.020> I<00:02:55.170> can<00:02:55.290> play<00:02:55.440> them

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
don't see where's games I can play them

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.830 
don't see where's games I can play them
here<00:02:55.740> and<00:02:55.830> there<00:02:55.980> but<00:02:56.220> this<00:02:56.460> one<00:02:56.730> I<00:02:56.970> just<00:02:57.630> liked

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
here and there but this one I just liked

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.270 
here and there but this one I just liked
a<00:02:57.960> whole<00:02:57.990> lot<00:02:58.230> more<00:02:58.440> and<00:02:58.710> now<00:02:58.770> to<00:02:58.830> see<00:02:59.010> if<00:02:59.100> I<00:02:59.160> can

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
a whole lot more and now to see if I can

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.310 
a whole lot more and now to see if I can
compare<00:02:59.550> from<00:02:59.760> all<00:02:59.970> dynasty<00:03:00.780> wars<00:03:00.960> games<00:03:01.170> that

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
compare from all dynasty wars games that

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.690 
compare from all dynasty wars games that
I<00:03:01.380> play<00:03:01.500> in<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.650> past<00:03:01.860> I'd<00:03:02.280> say<00:03:02.490> this<00:03:02.550> is<00:03:02.640> the

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
I play in the past I'd say this is the

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.460 
I play in the past I'd say this is the
best<00:03:02.850> one<00:03:03.090> especially<00:03:03.720> in<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.170> one<00:03:04.350> piece

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
best one especially in the one piece

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.950 
best one especially in the one piece
pirate<00:03:04.770> warriors<00:03:04.890> series<00:03:05.810> dynasty<00:03:06.810> where's

Gundam I never liked I was probably the

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.740 
Gundam I never liked I was probably the

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
only dynasty Warriors clone that I just

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.510 
only dynasty Warriors clone that I just
could<00:03:10.020> not<00:03:10.110> get<00:03:10.290> into<00:03:10.440> but<00:03:10.800> I<00:03:10.830> got<00:03:11.100> to<00:03:11.220> say<00:03:11.340> that

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
could not get into but I got to say that

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.090 
could not get into but I got to say that

bad it's it's a dinosaurs game it's
already<00:03:19.440> comes<00:03:19.590> out<00:03:19.710> -<00:03:19.860> it<00:03:19.950> gets<00:03:20.040> very

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
already comes out - it gets very

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.890 
already comes out - it gets very
repetitive<00:03:20.490> now<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:21.150> then<00:03:21.270> I<00:03:21.420> mean<00:03:21.720> as<00:03:21.810> you

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
repetitive now and then I mean as you

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.000 
repetitive now and then I mean as you
see<00:03:22.050> the<00:03:22.140> gameplay<00:03:22.320> in<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.560> background<00:03:22.590> you

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
see the gameplay in the background you

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.740 
see the gameplay in the background you
see<00:03:23.040> me<00:03:23.340> doing<00:03:23.520> pretty<00:03:23.820> much<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.060> same<00:03:24.270> combos

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
see me doing pretty much the same combos

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.540 
see me doing pretty much the same combos
every<00:03:24.930> now<00:03:25.080> and<00:03:25.230> then<00:03:25.320> I<00:03:25.500> do<00:03:26.040> square<00:03:26.340> square

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
every now and then I do square square

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:27.800 
every now and then I do square square
triangle<00:03:26.880> triangle<00:03:27.000> square<00:03:27.210> square<00:03:27.480> just<00:03:27.660> any

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
triangle triangle square square just any

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.630 
triangle triangle square square just any
combination<00:03:28.320> that<00:03:28.470> and<00:03:28.620> then<00:03:28.710> I<00:03:28.800> link<00:03:29.040> into<00:03:29.340> a

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
combination that and then I link into a

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.610 
combination that and then I link into a
special<00:03:30.420> attack<00:03:30.660> or<00:03:30.870> team<00:03:31.080> special<00:03:31.410> attack

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
special attack or team special attack

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.530 
special attack or team special attack
it's<00:03:31.770> pretty<00:03:31.950> much<00:03:32.070> tie<00:03:32.730> it<00:03:32.790> down<00:03:32.970> to<00:03:33.150> that<00:03:33.300> now

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
it's pretty much tie it down to that now

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.700 
it's pretty much tie it down to that now
if<00:03:33.630> you<00:03:33.720> don't<00:03:33.870> get<00:03:33.960> tired<00:03:34.170> repetitive

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710 
if you don't get tired repetitive

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.830 
if you don't get tired repetitive
business<00:03:35.010> then<00:03:35.310> you<00:03:35.490> probably<00:03:35.820> won't<00:03:36.060> have

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
business then you probably won't have

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.000 
business then you probably won't have
much<00:03:36.960> of<00:03:36.990> an<00:03:37.110> issue<00:03:37.200> but<00:03:37.470> again<00:03:37.530> if<00:03:37.800> you<00:03:37.890> keep

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
much of an issue but again if you keep

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.260 
much of an issue but again if you keep
playing<00:03:38.160> game<00:03:38.460> over<00:03:38.670> and<00:03:38.790> over<00:03:38.940> again<00:03:39.030> you're

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
playing game over and over again you're

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:40.400 
playing game over and over again you're
going<00:03:39.390> to<00:03:39.510> realize<00:03:39.750> that<00:03:39.900> you<00:03:40.050> just<00:03:40.110> button

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
going to realize that you just button

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.440 
going to realize that you just button
mashing<00:03:40.710> the<00:03:40.890> same<00:03:41.160> three<00:03:41.850> buttons<00:03:42.180> over<00:03:42.300> and

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
mashing the same three buttons over and

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.000 
mashing the same three buttons over and
over<00:03:42.600> again<00:03:42.690> and<00:03:42.930> that's<00:03:43.320> all<00:03:43.560> you<00:03:43.680> end<00:03:43.770> up<00:03:43.860> see

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
over again and that's all you end up see

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.650 
over again and that's all you end up see
in<00:03:44.070> the<00:03:44.130> screen<00:03:44.370> so<00:03:44.880> that's<00:03:44.940> probably<00:03:45.150> thing

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
in the screen so that's probably thing

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.660 
in the screen so that's probably thing
that's<00:03:45.900> bad<00:03:46.020> about<00:03:46.080> it<00:03:46.380> um<00:03:46.560> as<00:03:47.310> far<00:03:47.610> as

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
that's bad about it um as far as

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.490 
that's bad about it um as far as
mechanics<00:03:48.270> the<00:03:48.390> game<00:03:48.600> breaks<00:03:48.900> down<00:03:49.080> into

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
mechanics the game breaks down into

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.440 
mechanics the game breaks down into
several<00:03:49.680> parts<00:03:50.040> you<00:03:50.160> have<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.970> main<00:03:51.120> story

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
several parts you have the main story

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.540 
several parts you have the main story
which<00:03:51.660> follows<00:03:51.990> the<00:03:52.170> story<00:03:52.830> all<00:03:53.070> way<00:03:53.220> up<00:03:53.340> to

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
which follows the story all way up to

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.640 
which follows the story all way up to
dressrosa<00:03:54.360> which<00:03:54.750> is<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:54.960> most<00:03:55.110> recent<00:03:55.290> part

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
dressrosa which is the most recent part

probably<00:04:02.820> my<00:04:02.940> favorite<00:04:03.330> aspect<00:04:03.810> in<00:04:03.900> the<00:04:03.960> game

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
probably my favorite aspect in the game

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.750 
probably my favorite aspect in the game
it's<00:04:04.260> more<00:04:04.440> about<00:04:04.710> our<00:04:04.980> case<00:04:05.280> style<00:04:05.550> thing

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
it's more about our case style thing

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.640 
it's more about our case style thing
where<00:04:06.210> you<00:04:06.270> get<00:04:06.360> to<00:04:06.420> pick<00:04:06.540> any<00:04:06.720> character<00:04:07.380> and

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
where you get to pick any character and

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.230 
where you get to pick any character and
then<00:04:07.950> you<00:04:08.070> are<00:04:08.400> kind<00:04:08.730> of<00:04:08.820> on<00:04:08.940> it's<00:04:09.120> like<00:04:09.180> a

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
then you are kind of on it's like a

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.610 
then you are kind of on it's like a
little<00:04:09.390> board<00:04:09.720> as<00:04:09.900> you<00:04:10.110> know<00:04:10.170> on<00:04:10.320> a<00:04:10.350> schema

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
little board as you know on a schema

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.960 
little board as you know on a schema
here<00:04:10.800> what's<00:04:11.100> lobe<00:04:11.280> or<00:04:11.520> we<00:04:11.640> just<00:04:11.790> go<00:04:11.880> for

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
here what's lobe or we just go for

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.010 
here what's lobe or we just go for
mission<00:04:12.240> the<00:04:12.300> mission<00:04:12.420> and<00:04:12.660> you<00:04:12.750> fight

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
mission the mission and you fight

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.420 
mission the mission and you fight
whoever<00:04:13.530> you<00:04:13.680> supposed<00:04:13.890> to<00:04:13.950> fight<00:04:14.130> so<00:04:14.280> it's

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
whoever you supposed to fight so it's

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.070 
whoever you supposed to fight so it's
kind<00:04:14.580> of<00:04:14.610> like<00:04:14.760> it's<00:04:15.390> based<00:04:15.540> in<00:04:15.630> arcade<00:04:15.900> game

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
kind of like it's based in arcade game

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.020 
kind of like it's based in arcade game
for<00:04:16.410> some<00:04:16.530> reason<00:04:16.799> I<00:04:16.890> like<00:04:16.920> their<00:04:17.340> kid<00:04:17.609> aspect

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
for some reason I like their kid aspect

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.789 
for some reason I like their kid aspect
of<00:04:18.090> this<00:04:18.180> game<00:04:18.299> a<00:04:18.480> whole<00:04:18.870> lot<00:04:18.989> better<00:04:19.140> than<00:04:19.470> a

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
of this game a whole lot better than a

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.349 
of this game a whole lot better than a
story<00:04:20.160> mode<00:04:20.310> that's<00:04:20.549> probably<00:04:20.820> only<00:04:21.000> because

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
story mode that's probably only because

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.300 
story mode that's probably only because
I<00:04:21.690> played<00:04:22.200> through<00:04:22.470> the<00:04:22.590> previous<00:04:22.830> one

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
I played through the previous one

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.340 
I played through the previous one
piecework<00:04:23.610> games<00:04:24.090> and<00:04:24.330> up<00:04:24.540> until<00:04:24.750> I<00:04:24.900> catch<00:04:25.320> up

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
piecework games and up until I catch up

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.170 
piecework games and up until I catch up
to<00:04:25.560> where<00:04:25.740> I'm<00:04:25.830> supposed<00:04:26.100> to<00:04:26.190> be<00:04:26.340> it's<00:04:26.910> going

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
to where I'm supposed to be it's going

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.969 
to where I'm supposed to be it's going
kind<00:04:27.330> of<00:04:27.389> repetitive<00:04:27.600> to<00:04:27.780> me<00:04:27.900> but<00:04:28.169> the<00:04:28.770> story

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
kind of repetitive to me but the story

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:30.230 
kind of repetitive to me but the story
was<00:04:29.130> great<00:04:29.250> actually<00:04:29.669> it's<00:04:29.820> not<00:04:29.910> that<00:04:29.970> it's

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
was great actually it's not that it's

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.330 
was great actually it's not that it's
bad<00:04:30.360> it's<00:04:30.660> just<00:04:31.139> that<00:04:31.259> I<00:04:31.560> kind<00:04:32.009> of<00:04:32.070> just<00:04:32.190> like

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
bad it's just that I kind of just like

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.189 
bad it's just that I kind of just like
jumping<00:04:32.820> into<00:04:32.970> the<00:04:33.360> action<00:04:33.750> and<00:04:33.810> just<00:04:33.960> kind<00:04:34.169> of

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
jumping into the action and just kind of

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:35.480 
jumping into the action and just kind of
finding<00:04:34.440> everything<00:04:34.650> we're<00:04:35.130> not<00:04:35.220> too<00:04:35.340> many

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
finding everything we're not too many

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.700 
finding everything we're not too many
cutscenes<00:04:35.910> but<00:04:36.330> visually<00:04:37.169> when<00:04:37.500> it<00:04:37.590> comes

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
cutscenes but visually when it comes

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.020 
cutscenes but visually when it comes
down<00:04:37.770> to<00:04:37.830> cutscenes<00:04:38.220> it<00:04:38.400> looks<00:04:38.550> great

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
down to cutscenes it looks great

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.850

I believe it's fifty bucks on the ps3

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.800 
I believe it's fifty bucks on the ps3
and<00:05:29.220> PS<00:05:29.789> Vita<00:05:29.820> I'm<00:05:30.300> not<00:05:30.449> really<00:05:30.539> sure<00:05:30.660> action

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
and PS Vita I'm not really sure action

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.230

Vita<00:05:31.199> for<00:05:31.710> the<00:05:31.800> ps4<00:05:32.070> I<00:05:32.280> believed<00:05:32.610> about<00:05:32.849> 60

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
Vita for the ps4 I believed about 60

Vita for the ps4 I believed about 60
bucks<00:05:33.389> and<00:05:33.990> I<00:05:34.050> think<00:05:34.199> for<00:05:34.289> ps4<00:05:34.620> it's<00:05:34.740> the<00:05:34.800> only

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
bucks and I think for ps4 it's the only

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:37.189 
bucks and I think for ps4 it's the only
game<00:05:35.220> was<00:05:35.400> available<00:05:35.580> physical<00:05:35.970> for<00:05:36.690> ps3<00:05:36.960> and

game was available physical for ps3 and

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:39.020 
game was available physical for ps3 and
PS<00:05:37.530> Vita<00:05:37.560> it's<00:05:37.830> available<00:05:37.979> digital<00:05:38.520> only<00:05:38.699> I

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
PS Vita it's available digital only I

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.670 
PS Vita it's available digital only I
believe<00:05:39.330> and<00:05:39.479> also<00:05:39.900> it's<00:05:40.050> only<00:05:40.199> subtitle

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
believe and also it's only subtitle

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.529 
believe and also it's only subtitle
assigned<00:05:40.919> english<00:05:41.220> dub<00:05:41.370> just<00:05:41.610> japanese<00:05:42.030> with

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
I'll just probably cheaper to do it that

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.570
