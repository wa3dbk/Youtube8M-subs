and<00:01:19.950> we<00:01:20.950> batted<00:01:21.280> around<00:01:21.399> a<00:01:21.670> few<00:01:21.850> things<00:01:22.119> the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
and we batted around a few things the

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.249 
and we batted around a few things the
original<00:01:22.960> idea<00:01:23.680> was<00:01:23.979> to<00:01:24.910> keep<00:01:25.420> it<00:01:25.600> real<00:01:26.050> simple

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
single p90 and a volume control and then

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.820 
single p90 and a volume control and then
we<00:01:29.950> came<00:01:30.280> to<00:01:30.880> realize<00:01:31.360> that<00:01:31.390> if<00:01:32.110> we<00:01:32.319> put<00:01:32.619> the
