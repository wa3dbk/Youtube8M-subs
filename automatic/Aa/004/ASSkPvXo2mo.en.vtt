oh<00:00:14.309> man<00:00:15.309> ah<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:18.100> way<00:00:18.220> stars<00:00:18.580> live<00:00:18.940> and<00:00:18.970> die

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.240 
oh man ah the way stars live and die

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.120 
oh man ah the way stars live and die
makes<00:00:19.630> a<00:00:19.720> lot<00:00:19.840> of<00:00:19.870> sense<00:00:20.230> if<00:00:20.650> you<00:00:20.800> consider

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
makes a lot of sense if you consider

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.690 
makes a lot of sense if you consider
what<00:00:21.400> a<00:00:21.430> star<00:00:21.790> really<00:00:22.180> is<00:00:23.040> simply<00:00:24.040> put<00:00:24.250> a<00:00:24.460> star

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:24.700 
what a star really is simply put a star

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.790 
what a star really is simply put a star

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.000 
is a large amount of gas and dust that
is<00:00:26.830> collapsing<00:00:27.550> under<00:00:27.700> the<00:00:27.910> force<00:00:28.120> of<00:00:28.300> gravity
