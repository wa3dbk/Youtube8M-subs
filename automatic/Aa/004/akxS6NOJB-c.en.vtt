see<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:50.329> there's<00:00:51.329> two<00:00:51.360> down<00:00:51.660> there<00:00:52.129> and

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
see that there's two down there and

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.670 
see that there's two down there and
there's<00:00:53.340> two<00:00:53.489> up<00:00:53.610> here<00:00:53.899> which<00:00:54.899> push<00:00:55.440> your

00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:10.859 
but once in a while it's useful they

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:30.350 
but once in a while it's useful they
have<00:01:11.009> that<00:01:11.159> feeling

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.330 

and<00:01:30.900> also<00:01:31.170> while<00:01:31.470> you're<00:01:31.590> doing<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.190> can

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.150 
you can run around the court that's a
chord<00:01:34.650> progression<00:01:34.680> right<00:01:35.900> snakes<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.500> fly

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
chord progression right snakes to fly

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.400 
chord progression right snakes to fly

straddling or 2:1 breakups or something

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:10.219 
straddling or 2:1 breakups or something
on<00:02:01.440> the<00:02:01.500> right<00:02:01.650> hand<00:02:01.860> listen<00:02:08.840> now<00:02:09.840> that's<00:02:10.050> not

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
on the right hand listen now that's not

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.710 
on the right hand listen now that's not
something<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.649> played<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:10.920> song<00:02:11.040> but<00:02:11.720> unless

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
something you played a song but unless

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.980 
something you played a song but unless
it<00:02:12.900> was<00:02:13.020> just<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:13.770> know<00:02:13.830> as<00:02:14.100> a<00:02:14.130> filler<00:02:14.550> between

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
it was just you know as a filler between

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.690 
it was just you know as a filler between
phrases<00:02:15.990> but<00:02:16.470> it's<00:02:16.980> really<00:02:17.280> good<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.520> practice

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
phrases but it's really good to practice

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.120 
phrases but it's really good to practice
because<00:02:18.330> your<00:02:19.020> left<00:02:19.200> hand<00:02:19.500> can<00:02:19.770> keep<00:02:19.980> going

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
because your left hand can keep going

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.130 
because your left hand can keep going
like<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.459> while<00:02:21.450> your<00:02:21.600> right<00:02:21.780> hand<00:02:21.959> does

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
like that while your right hand does

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.449 
like that while your right hand does
something<00:02:22.530> entirely<00:02:22.860> different

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
something entirely different

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.550 
something entirely different
okay<00:02:23.760> there<00:02:24.360> I'm<00:02:24.480> just<00:02:24.690> running<00:02:25.020> up<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.290> chord

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
okay there I'm just running up the chord

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.180 
okay there I'm just running up the chord
like<00:02:25.770> that<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.400> back<00:02:27.150> down<00:02:27.740> so<00:02:28.740> I'll<00:02:28.830> do<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.100> on

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
like that and back down so I'll do it on

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.400 
like that and back down so I'll do it on
C

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
C

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.430
