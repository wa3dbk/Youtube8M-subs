00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:16.950 
we come see is quite difficult as you

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.730 
we come see is quite difficult as you
can<00:00:16.980> possibly<00:00:17.220> see<00:00:17.690> because<00:00:18.690> it's<00:00:18.900> blind<00:00:19.170> just

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
can possibly see because it's blind just

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.710 
can possibly see because it's blind just
quite<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:19.920> tricky<00:00:20.280> sort<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.550> approach<00:00:20.910> very

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
quite a tricky sort of approach very

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.240 
quite a tricky sort of approach very
difficult<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.170> see<00:00:22.349> where<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.590> turn<00:00:22.800> in<00:00:23.039> and

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
difficult to see where to turn in and

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.790 
difficult to see where to turn in and
where<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:23.820> goes<00:00:23.939> next<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:24.449> just<00:00:25.109> experienced

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
where it goes next so just experienced

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.460 
where it goes next so just experienced
an<00:00:25.980> instinct<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.109> take<00:00:28.109> over<00:00:28.320> there

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
an instinct to take over there

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.639 
an instinct to take over there
fourth<00:00:29.980> gear<00:00:30.070> down<00:00:30.369> the<00:00:30.490> third<00:00:30.699> gear<00:00:31.619> what<00:00:32.619> a

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:32.649 
fourth gear down the third gear what a

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:33.840 
fourth gear down the third gear what a
lot<00:00:32.770> of<00:00:32.829> people<00:00:32.920> don't<00:00:33.309> appreciate<00:00:33.430> this

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
lot of people don't appreciate this

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.250 
lot of people don't appreciate this
actually<00:00:34.180> a<00:00:34.210> figure<00:00:34.450> of<00:00:34.510> eight<00:00:34.660> we<00:00:34.840> use<00:00:35.020> it

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
actually a figure of eight we use it

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.869 
actually a figure of eight we use it
yeah<00:00:35.739> so<00:00:36.100> that<00:00:36.220> we<00:00:36.309> come<00:00:36.489> from<00:00:36.610> both

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:36.879 
yeah so that we come from both

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:38.310 
yeah so that we come from both
directions<00:00:37.059> here<00:00:37.570> this<00:00:37.690> is<00:00:37.809> the<00:00:37.840> center<00:00:38.290> of

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
directions here this is the center of

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.640 
directions here this is the center of
the<00:00:38.470> eight<00:00:38.649> if<00:00:38.829> you<00:00:38.860> like

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:40.650

you<00:01:24.150> know

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.440 

this<00:01:31.000> is<00:01:31.149> a<00:01:31.329> follow-through<00:01:32.280> fast<00:01:33.280> corner

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
this is a follow-through fast corner

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.370 
this is a follow-through fast corner
I<00:01:35.770> just<00:01:36.770> cutting<00:01:37.340> other<00:01:37.520> end<00:01:37.670> white<00:01:37.850> paint<00:01:38.380> and

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
I just cutting other end white paint and

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.200 
I just cutting other end white paint and
only<00:01:39.590> we<00:01:39.950> will<00:01:40.070> go<00:01:40.219> to<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:40.460> left<00:01:40.670> of<00:01:40.820> the<00:01:40.969> tires

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
only we will go to the left of the tires

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.990 
only we will go to the left of the tires
where<00:01:41.539> there's<00:01:41.689> a<00:01:41.719> horrible<00:01:41.960> bump<00:01:42.320> there

where there's a horrible bump there

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.030 
where there's a horrible bump there
so<00:01:43.330> we're<00:01:43.450> just<00:01:43.480> avoiding<00:01:43.990> it<00:01:44.080> going<00:01:44.410> back<00:01:45.010> to

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
so we're just avoiding it going back to

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.690 
so we're just avoiding it going back to
the<00:01:45.160> tires<00:01:45.430> like<00:01:45.670> that

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
the tires like that

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.600 
the tires like that
same<00:01:47.420> thing<00:01:47.659> really

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.780

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.040 

just<00:01:56.390> taking<00:01:56.690> a<00:01:56.750> bit<00:01:56.900> of<00:01:56.930> the<00:01:57.080> apex<00:01:57.410> here<00:01:59.050> then

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
just taking a bit of the apex here then

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.070 
just taking a bit of the apex here then
it's<00:02:00.200> a<00:02:00.320> gamble<00:02:00.560> this<00:02:01.010> is<00:02:01.160> down

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.910
