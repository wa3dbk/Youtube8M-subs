 Do you like Jesus, Jesus? 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.410

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.140

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.010
 christianity 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.680
 we can never forget that the death of 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.219
 cross was one of the most humiliating 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.640
 dwellings and painful deaths that existed 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.010
 it was a shame if it was classified and 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.809
 jesus christ came and had a death of 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.730
 cross and it was for me it was for you 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.260
 then we are talking here between 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.840
 christianity 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.559
 never forget we had a moment in 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.720
 God turned the son of man into 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.880
 the children of men could generate 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.590
 sons of god joÃ£o calvino who said 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:16.320
 when the American ship landed on the 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.480
 moon the president of then president 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.730
 American then said that it was the day 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.030
 most important of humanity because the 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.590
 man who bet foot on the moon and billy 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.660
 Graham replied that he could not 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.820
 most important of humanity was when 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.870
 God's foot on the earth in the figure of 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.000
 Jesus Christ 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:36.060
 So today it's for you that I'm a Christian. 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.630
 I want to call you the responsibility of 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.210
 that our life is at least the life of the 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.160
 Christian religion can not be ruled by 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.380
 matter can not be ruled by the 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.510
 can not be guided by the 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.450
 our personal interests we are 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.850
 challenged to be different challenged to 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.270
 live like jesus lived like talk on 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.530
 mateus 5 verse 16 you are worth reading 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.970
 sermon from the hill all that are the 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.880
 chapters 567 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.890
 but if he speaks as soon as his light 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.570
 shine for the world 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.759
 because when our light shines for the 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.020
 world people will glorify god 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.510
 who is in the skies 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.580
 So Jesus came and died to leave a 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.580
 alternative to leave salvation 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:21.090
 and if you are a part of Christianity, 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.820
 You 're a Christian, I want to challenge you. 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.190
 remember that you had a death in the middle that 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.610
 it was just to forgive sins 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.670
 but that just as he had to die had to 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.470
 resurrection and he is alive and 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.380
 You can talk to him and read the 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.100
 His word and today's message is to 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.100
 We remember that.
