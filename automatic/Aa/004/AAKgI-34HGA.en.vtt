00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.240
 a short time ago the method 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.150
 traditional one for you to get a 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.120
 dental prosthesis required many visits 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.369
 your dentist still and come with 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.020
 you did not adapt with the 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.480
 your temporary tooth 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.980
 now doctor leandro gianecchini for the 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.800
 our viewer has a knowledge 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.580
 this time has greatly reduced with the 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.050
 dental center 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.730
 So today, in which we can 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.890
 work in a period of approximately 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.390
 an hour to make an environment of 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.760
 porcelain that before we arrived at 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.469
 times up to 28 days 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.899
 so we brought the technology of the 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.850
 germany that allows a tooth for 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.140
 week without ever changing the numbers 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.030
 consultations in numbers of anesthetists 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.399
 a visit is hardly practically patient 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.160
 comes toothache in the day with porcelain 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.469
 ready just an anesthesia one visit 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.260
 in an hour you go out with your prosthesis 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.059
 Dental center now comes the provisional 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.739
 Provisional drawing now we need 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.359
 explain to our viewer that 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.129
 you are certainly surprised by this 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.049
 information that we are experiencing as 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.240
 is that you can develop this 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.520
 prosthesis in such a short time 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.590
 how it works we brought a system 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.860
 in Germany where we have a 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.630
 scanning device that eliminates 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.130
 of evil, then that part of 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.720
 Patient wickedness with the ship has 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.509
 difficulty throwing the mouth forward 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.460
 small bruise who finished with a 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.290
 scanner does not expect to enter the 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.229
 We make pictures that we do the 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.060
 capturing images in the mouth not to ride 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.460
 a digital model with this model 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.020
 digital we ride people draws 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.540
 within this new patient according to 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.159
 the face and the machine in 15 minutes she 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.079
 prints porcelain that we call 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.000
 direct attention on the mouth then 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.280
 part molding week from 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.170
 models of risk when several steps are 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.000
 people eliminate distortions 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.770
 so it has a much greater attention of the 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.200
 that we had before remembering that 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.000
 a perfect metal porcelain prosthesis 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.920
 much greater accuracy through this 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.110
 already seeing as getting 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.340
 then 21 even better than 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.930
 really there was in the form 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.719
