00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.410
 It was 15 years in the showcase one

 Cylinder head and that's easy 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.140
 the special thing about this machine 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.240
 at that time in quotes 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.210
 fierce race with chrysler herkules 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.830

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.770
 I have been sold in Holland 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.770
 just learned that there are still too 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.990
 know about this machine 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.820
 the special thing about this cs 50 is 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.220
 quite simply that in contrast to the 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.470
 German makes in Holland 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.509
 Only machines were sold 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.250
 all equipped with pedals 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.560
 German models have fixed 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.220
 Footpegs only in Holland were these 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.350
 pedalen 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.210
 that had something to do with the insurance 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.259
 do that was then still as a bicycle with 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.540
 auxiliary engine and was accordingly 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.790
 cheaper that makes the special feature 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.080
 or is the peculiarity of this cs 50 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.430
 which we have at the fair 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:05.640
 how old is this machine that is from 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:07.440
 So 1975 belongs to the younger ones 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.190
 Here we see quite a bit 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.310
 contrast program to the proceeding machine 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:17.850

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:21.230
