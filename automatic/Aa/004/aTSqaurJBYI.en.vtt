video where I'm showing you how I make

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.189 
video where I'm showing you how I make
some<00:00:15.929> of<00:00:16.049> my<00:00:16.139> wood<00:00:16.350> background<00:00:16.619> surfaces<00:00:18.199> for

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
some of my wood background surfaces for

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.250 
some of my wood background surfaces for
a<00:00:19.230> lot<00:00:19.380> of<00:00:19.410> my<00:00:19.590> jobs<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:20.220> have<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.990> create<00:00:21.990> a

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
a lot of my jobs I have to create a

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.490 
a lot of my jobs I have to create a
surface<00:00:23.039> for<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.670> client<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.269> will<00:00:24.990> be<00:00:25.109> given<00:00:25.410> a

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
surface for the client I will be given a

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.589 
surface for the client I will be given a
sample<00:00:25.740> maybe<00:00:26.640> something<00:00:27.029> they<00:00:27.150> found<00:00:27.359> on

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
sample maybe something they found on

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:28.939 
sample maybe something they found on
stock<00:00:27.960> or<00:00:28.230> something<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.769> they've<00:00:28.920> used

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
stock or something that they've used

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.279 
stock or something that they've used
previously<00:00:29.369> before<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:30.779> have<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.109> match

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
previously before that I have to match

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.740 
previously before that I have to match
to<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.669> lot<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.120> times<00:00:33.329> I'll<00:00:33.480> make<00:00:33.630> it

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
to so a lot of the times I'll make it

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.450 
to so a lot of the times I'll make it
myself<00:00:33.930> because<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.860> actually<00:00:35.040> enjoy<00:00:35.430> doing

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
myself because I actually enjoy doing

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.410 
myself because I actually enjoy doing
this<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:36.690> today<00:00:37.820> I'm<00:00:38.820> actually<00:00:39.180> doing

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
this so today I'm actually doing

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.750 
this so today I'm actually doing
something<00:00:39.570> that's<00:00:40.230> I'm<00:00:41.040> going<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.309> be<00:00:41.430> using

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
something that's I'm going to be using

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.560 
something that's I'm going to be using
for<00:00:42.059> some<00:00:43.340> Maryland<00:00:44.340> crabs<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.239> bought

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
for some Maryland crabs that I bought

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.299 
for some Maryland crabs that I bought
and<00:00:45.960> this<00:00:46.230> will<00:00:46.379> probably<00:00:46.680> end<00:00:46.770> up<00:00:46.860> being<00:00:46.920> used

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
and this will probably end up being used

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.790 
and this will probably end up being used
in<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.550> few<00:00:47.760> more<00:00:47.989> few<00:00:48.989> other<00:00:49.140> shots<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.680> do

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
in a few more few other shots that I do

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.990 
in a few more few other shots that I do
so<00:00:50.190> I'm<00:00:51.180> showing<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.809> mid<00:00:52.110> process

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
so I'm showing you this mid process

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.310 
so I'm showing you this mid process
there's<00:00:54.079> obviously<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.199> blue<00:00:55.879> coat<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:57.059> paint

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
there's obviously a blue coat of paint

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.010 
there's obviously a blue coat of paint
that's<00:00:58.320> already<00:00:58.710> down<00:00:58.980> on<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.219> surface<00:01:00.020> what

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
that's already down on the surface what

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.910 
that's already down on the surface what
I<00:01:01.050> tend<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.500> do<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:02.010> mix<00:01:02.699> paints<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:04.229> water

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
I tend to do is mix paints and I water

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.060 
I tend to do is mix paints and I water
them<00:01:05.189> down<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.430> lot<00:01:06.170> so<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.560> saves<00:01:07.830> some<00:01:08.040> money

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
them down a lot so it saves some money

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.679 
them down a lot so it saves some money
you<00:01:08.340> can<00:01:08.490> just<00:01:08.610> get<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.760> quarter<00:01:09.090> paint<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.600> it

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
you can just get a quarter paint and it

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.450 
you can just get a quarter paint and it
will<00:01:09.780> last<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:10.110> long<00:01:10.229> time<00:01:11.960> so<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.650> blue<00:01:13.920> color

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
will last a long time so the blue color

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.370 
will last a long time so the blue color
underneath<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.390> gray<00:01:16.100> is<00:01:17.100> cut<00:01:17.580> down<00:01:17.930> 5050<00:01:18.930> so

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
underneath the gray is cut down 5050 so

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.270 
underneath the gray is cut down 5050 so
half<00:01:19.890> water<00:01:20.280> half<00:01:20.640> paint<00:01:21.560> the<00:01:22.560> wash<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:23.189> I'm

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
half water half paint the wash that I'm

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.070 
half water half paint the wash that I'm
putting<00:01:23.520> on<00:01:23.790> top<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:25.369> also<00:01:26.369> about<00:01:26.939> 50/50<00:01:27.869> half

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
putting on top is also about 50/50 half

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.480 
putting on top is also about 50/50 half
water<00:01:28.890> half<00:01:29.070> paint<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.740> I<00:01:31.740> do<00:01:31.799> have<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.130> third

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
water half paint and I do have a third

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.069 
water half paint and I do have a third
color<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.090> might<00:01:33.360> introduce<00:01:33.659> later

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
color that I might introduce later

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.319 
color that I might introduce later
depending<00:01:34.710> on<00:01:34.799> how<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.130> dries<00:01:35.460> down<00:01:35.909> once

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
depending on how this dries down once

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.780 
depending on how this dries down once
when<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.810> paint<00:01:37.020> dries<00:01:37.200> down<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:38.220> changes

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
when the paint dries down it it changes

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.969 
when the paint dries down it it changes
quite<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.390> lot<00:01:39.659> sometimes<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:41.159> if<00:01:42.079> you<00:01:43.079> can<00:01:43.740> tell

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
quite a lot sometimes so if you can tell

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.950 
quite a lot sometimes so if you can tell
by<00:01:44.159> this<00:01:44.220> video<00:01:45.180> i'm<00:01:45.750> actually<00:01:46.020> using

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
by this video i'm actually using

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.800 
by this video i'm actually using
floorboards<00:01:49.049> these<00:01:49.350> are<00:01:49.530> plank<00:01:49.920> boards<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.909> I

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
floorboards these are plank boards and I

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.330 
floorboards these are plank boards and I
got<00:01:51.990> them<00:01:52.170> from<00:01:52.350> Home<00:01:52.530> Depot<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.920> they're

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
got them from Home Depot and they're

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.920 
got them from Home Depot and they're
very<00:01:53.520> inexpensive<00:01:53.790> they're<00:01:54.360> about<00:01:54.570> five

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
very inexpensive they're about five

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.580 
very inexpensive they're about five
dollars<00:01:55.170> for<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.920> twelve<00:01:56.700> foot<00:01:56.909> board<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.840> you

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
dollars for a twelve foot board and you

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.060 
dollars for a twelve foot board and you
know<00:01:58.680> they<00:01:58.829> just<00:01:59.009> they<00:01:59.189> come<00:01:59.460> apart<00:01:59.759> here<00:02:00.060> and

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
know they just they come apart here and

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.249 
know they just they come apart here and
I'm<00:02:02.070> using<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.790> wrong<00:02:03.060> side<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.020> board

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
I'm using the wrong side of the board

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.359 
I'm using the wrong side of the board
it's<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.590> very<00:02:04.860> rough<00:02:05.250> texture<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.740> so<00:02:07.740> you

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
it's a very rough texture and so you

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.309 
it's a very rough texture and so you
would<00:02:08.520> typically<00:02:09.030> not<00:02:09.179> use

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
would typically not use

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.429 
would typically not use
side<00:02:10.739> in<00:02:11.189> your<00:02:11.579> house<00:02:11.760> be<00:02:12.659> very<00:02:12.870> painful<00:02:13.260> to

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:13.439 
side in your house be very painful to

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:15.920 
side in your house be very painful to
walk<00:02:13.620> on<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.459> other<00:02:14.639> side<00:02:15.030> is<00:02:15.269> the<00:02:15.480> smoother

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
walk on the other side is the smoother

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.890 
walk on the other side is the smoother
side<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.439> sanded<00:02:16.980> side<00:02:17.249> the<00:02:17.609> finish<00:02:18.540> side

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
side the sanded side the finish side

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.199

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:31.889 
and yeah so I region why I'm using the

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:34.009 
and yeah so I region why I'm using the
wrong<00:02:32.069> side<00:02:32.400> is<00:02:32.639> I<00:02:32.670> want<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.269> texture<00:02:33.629> of<00:02:33.750> the

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
wrong side is I want the texture of the

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.640 
wrong side is I want the texture of the
wood<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.500> want<00:02:34.769> that<00:02:34.889> texture<00:02:35.340> to<00:02:35.459> show<00:02:35.790> through

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
wood I want that texture to show through

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.280 
wood I want that texture to show through
if<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.950> use<00:02:38.549> the<00:02:38.700> other<00:02:38.849> side<00:02:39.269> it's<00:02:39.629> too<00:02:39.959> shiny

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
if you use the other side it's too shiny

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.830 
if you use the other side it's too shiny
it's<00:02:40.650> too<00:02:40.859> finished<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.609> sometimes<00:02:42.510> it<00:02:42.689> might

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
it's too finished and sometimes it might

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.959 
it's too finished and sometimes it might
even<00:02:43.019> reflect<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.769> light<00:02:44.010> in<00:02:44.370> a<00:02:44.519> wet<00:02:44.700> manner

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:44.969 
even reflect the light in a wet manner

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:50.720 
even reflect the light in a wet manner
that<00:02:45.599> I<00:02:45.659> don't<00:02:45.930> like<00:02:47.090> so<00:02:48.650> I'm<00:02:49.650> layering<00:02:50.189> up<00:02:50.489> my

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
that I don't like so I'm layering up my

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.069 
that I don't like so I'm layering up my
paint<00:02:51.030> here<00:02:51.799> I'm<00:02:52.799> adding<00:02:53.219> a<00:02:53.310> gray<00:02:53.609> wash<00:02:53.939> on<00:02:54.359> the

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
paint here I'm adding a gray wash on the

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.339 
paint here I'm adding a gray wash on the
top<00:02:55.379> trying<00:02:56.250> to<00:02:56.340> you<00:02:56.849> know<00:02:56.879> emulate<00:02:57.540> an<00:02:57.719> aged

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
top trying to you know emulate an aged

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.619 
top trying to you know emulate an aged
wood<00:02:59.060> something<00:03:00.060> that<00:03:00.180> maybe<00:03:00.329> has<00:03:00.449> been

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
wood something that maybe has been

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.530 
wood something that maybe has been
sitting<00:03:00.900> outside<00:03:01.049> for<00:03:01.709> a<00:03:01.739> while<00:03:01.919> and<00:03:02.540> I'll

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
sitting outside for a while and I'll

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.970 
sitting outside for a while and I'll
probably<00:03:03.840> just<00:03:04.290> keep<00:03:04.969> adding<00:03:06.650> some<00:03:07.650> more<00:03:07.829> of

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
probably just keep adding some more of

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.220 
probably just keep adding some more of
this<00:03:08.219> gray<00:03:08.519> wash<00:03:08.879> on<00:03:09.329> top<00:03:11.540> so<00:03:12.540> I'm<00:03:12.900> always

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
this gray wash on top so I'm always

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.770 
this gray wash on top so I'm always
using<00:03:13.650> acrylic<00:03:14.400> paint<00:03:14.849> I<00:03:15.150> never<00:03:15.540> use

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
using acrylic paint I never use

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.439 
using acrylic paint I never use
oil-based<00:03:16.349> paint<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:17.310> oil-based<00:03:17.639> paint<00:03:18.120> has

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:18.449 
oil-based paint the oil-based paint has

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:20.210 
oil-based paint the oil-based paint has
a<00:03:18.780> very<00:03:19.199> strong<00:03:19.680> smell

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
a very strong smell

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.170 
a very strong smell
you<00:03:21.090> know<00:03:21.209> you'll<00:03:21.989> you'll<00:03:22.439> feel<00:03:22.799> it<00:03:22.949> if<00:03:23.849> you're

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
you know you'll you'll feel it if you're

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.390 
you know you'll you'll feel it if you're
painting<00:03:24.689> boards<00:03:25.079> like<00:03:25.259> this<00:03:25.530> in<00:03:25.889> your<00:03:26.220> garage

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
painting boards like this in your garage

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.729 
painting boards like this in your garage
or<00:03:26.879> you<00:03:27.599> know<00:03:27.689> somewhere<00:03:28.049> that's<00:03:28.290> enclosed

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
or you know somewhere that's enclosed

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.439 
or you know somewhere that's enclosed
and<00:03:29.040> you're<00:03:29.159> using<00:03:29.340> oil-based<00:03:29.909> paint<00:03:30.239> you're

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:30.449 
and you're using oil-based paint you're

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:32.809 
and you're using oil-based paint you're
going<00:03:30.629> to<00:03:30.689> you're<00:03:31.409> going<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:31.620> feel<00:03:31.859> it<00:03:32.069> it

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
going to you're going to feel it it

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.969 
going to you're going to feel it it
it'll<00:03:33.750> make<00:03:33.900> you<00:03:34.049> not<00:03:34.199> feel<00:03:34.229> very<00:03:34.620> well

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:34.979 
it'll make you not feel very well

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:38.960 
it'll make you not feel very well
so<00:03:35.639> the<00:03:36.599> acrylic<00:03:37.019> paint<00:03:37.290> is<00:03:37.530> a<00:03:37.560> you<00:03:38.459> know<00:03:38.609> much

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
so the acrylic paint is a you know much

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.719 
so the acrylic paint is a you know much
easier<00:03:40.069> less<00:03:41.069> less<00:03:41.609> toxic<00:03:42.299> paint<00:03:42.599> to<00:03:42.810> use<00:03:43.049> and

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:43.729 
easier less less toxic paint to use and

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:46.219 
easier less less toxic paint to use and
then<00:03:44.729> the<00:03:44.879> cleanup<00:03:45.209> is<00:03:45.509> much<00:03:45.810> easier

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:46.229 
then the cleanup is much easier

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:47.629 
then the cleanup is much easier
obviously<00:03:46.379> you<00:03:46.680> can<00:03:46.769> just<00:03:46.799> use<00:03:47.040> water<00:03:47.370> with

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
obviously you can just use water with

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.569 
obviously you can just use water with
oil-based<00:03:48.180> paint<00:03:48.509> you<00:03:48.689> have<00:03:48.750> to<00:03:48.930> use<00:03:49.049> mineral

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
oil-based paint you have to use mineral

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.399 
oil-based paint you have to use mineral
spirits<00:03:50.579> or<00:03:50.849> depending<00:03:51.599> on<00:03:51.689> the<00:03:51.900> paint<00:03:52.229> or

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:52.409 
spirits or depending on the paint or

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:54.039 
spirits or depending on the paint or
varnish<00:03:52.590> you<00:03:52.829> have<00:03:53.009> to<00:03:53.099> use<00:03:53.219> lacquer<00:03:53.489> thinner

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
varnish you have to use lacquer thinner

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.209 
varnish you have to use lacquer thinner
so<00:03:55.049> this<00:03:55.889> is<00:03:56.040> just<00:03:56.310> a<00:03:56.459> lot<00:03:56.639> easier<00:03:56.699> to<00:03:57.239> use<00:03:57.269> so

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:58.219 
so this is just a lot easier to use so

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:01.699 
so this is just a lot easier to use so
I'm<00:03:59.219> going<00:03:59.370> to<00:03:59.430> keep<00:03:59.549> going<00:03:59.729> here<00:04:00.079> but<00:04:01.079> this<00:04:01.560> is

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
I'm going to keep going here but this is

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.379 
I'm going to keep going here but this is
just<00:04:01.919> one<00:04:02.069> example<00:04:02.219> of<00:04:02.699> how<00:04:02.819> to<00:04:02.879> make<00:04:03.150> your<00:04:03.180> own

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
just one example of how to make your own

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:06.769 
just one example of how to make your own
wood<00:04:04.049> backgrounds
