00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
okay so I'm going to be using this piece

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.190 
okay so I'm going to be using this piece
of<00:03:44.040> grey<00:03:44.370> leather<00:03:44.700> for<00:03:45.000> this<00:03:45.150> project<00:03:45.360> decide

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
and then draw a guide on the back of

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.310 
and then draw a guide on the back of
your<00:03:50.280> leather<00:03:50.460> I<00:03:50.760> made<00:03:51.120> mine<00:03:51.360> 4<00:03:51.720> inches<00:03:52.050> by<00:03:52.110> 2

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
your leather I made mine 4 inches by 2

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.470 
your leather I made mine 4 inches by 2
inches<00:03:52.580> carefully<00:03:53.580> cut<00:03:53.760> that<00:03:53.880> out<00:03:53.940> trying<00:03:54.450> to

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
inches carefully cut that out trying to

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.600 
inches carefully cut that out trying to
keep<00:03:54.630> your<00:03:54.780> edges<00:03:55.170> as<00:03:55.410> straight<00:03:55.800> as<00:03:56.040> possible

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
keep your edges as straight as possible

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.550 
keep your edges as straight as possible
then<00:03:56.940> trace<00:03:57.210> a<00:03:57.390> piece<00:03:57.660> and<00:03:57.930> cut<00:03:58.140> it<00:03:58.260> out<00:03:58.350> so<00:03:58.530> you

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
then trace a piece and cut it out so you

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.320 
then trace a piece and cut it out so you
have<00:03:58.680> two<00:03:58.830> pieces<00:03:59.040> that<00:03:59.280> are<00:03:59.460> the<00:03:59.670> exact<00:04:00.180> same

this<00:04:07.680> point<00:04:07.920> you<00:04:08.160> could<00:04:08.430> skip<00:04:08.820> straight<00:04:09.180> to

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
this point you could skip straight to

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.060 
this point you could skip straight to
the<00:04:09.420> gluing<00:04:09.810> but<00:04:10.050> I'm<00:04:10.260> going<00:04:10.500> to<00:04:10.560> add<00:04:10.710> a<00:04:10.740> little

want technically you don't have to do
this<00:04:36.990> step<00:04:37.230> but<00:04:37.440> it's<00:04:37.590> so<00:04:37.800> much<00:04:37.980> easier<00:04:38.010> to<00:04:38.400> sew

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
this step but it's so much easier to sew

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.820 
this step but it's so much easier to sew
