the jordan Crawford Avery Bradley and
Phil<00:01:52.680> Pressey<00:01:52.890> are<00:01:53.130> going<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.340> rack<00:01:53.640> up<00:01:53.759> more

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939

assists<00:01:54.299> in<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.479> future<00:01:54.810> they<00:01:55.200> got<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.470> learn

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619

these<00:01:55.920> new<00:01:56.159> rotations<00:01:56.759> but<00:01:56.909> I<00:01:57.119> really<00:01:57.540> think

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
these new rotations but I really think

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.969 
these new rotations but I really think
it's<00:01:57.810> going<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.960> work<00:01:58.140> out<00:01:58.290> moving<00:01:58.619> forward

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
it's going to work out moving forward

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.679 
it's going to work out moving forward
and<00:01:59.219> mark<00:01:59.549> we've<00:01:59.700> seen<00:01:59.909> this<00:02:00.030> new<00:02:00.240> Celtics

of this game what was different well
everything<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:08.789> mean<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.090> look<00:02:09.119> at<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.450> start

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
everything I mean you look at the start

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.210 
everything I mean you look at the start
of<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:09.899> game<00:02:10.140> they<00:02:10.649> didn't<00:02:10.890> play<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.009> well
