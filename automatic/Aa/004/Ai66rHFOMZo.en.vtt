00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
Gary here in the u.s. I think we make a

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.300 
Gary here in the u.s. I think we make a
little<00:02:45.630> bit<00:02:45.810> too<00:02:46.019> much<00:02:46.290> out<00:02:46.590> of<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.799> fact<00:02:47.040> of

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
little bit too much out of the fact of

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.940 
little bit too much out of the fact of
the<00:02:47.580> quote/unquote<00:02:48.269> lady<00:02:48.780> facing<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.709> boys

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
you obviously have a major mark not only

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.100 
you obviously have a major mark not only
here<00:02:53.310> but<00:02:53.459> across<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:54.150> pond<00:02:54.360> in<00:02:54.390> Europe

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
here but across the pond in Europe

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.530 
here but across the pond in Europe
Australia<00:02:55.709> it's<00:02:56.310> not<00:02:56.549> such<00:02:56.819> a<00:02:56.850> big<00:02:57.120> deal<00:02:57.360> in

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
Australia it's not such a big deal in

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.990 
Australia it's not such a big deal in
fact<00:02:57.720> it's<00:02:57.900> common<00:02:58.290> practice<00:02:58.610> do<00:02:59.610> you<00:02:59.670> think

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
fact it's common practice do you think

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.670 
fact it's common practice do you think
we<00:03:00.209> make<00:03:00.420> too<00:03:00.780> much<00:03:00.900> out<00:03:01.140> of<00:03:01.200> it<00:03:01.380> or<00:03:01.530> do<00:03:01.620> you

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
we make too much out of it or do you

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.870 
we make too much out of it or do you
think<00:03:01.769> that's<00:03:02.010> just<00:03:02.190> something<00:03:02.459> that<00:03:02.670> has

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
think that's just something that has

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.430 
think that's just something that has
happened<00:03:03.269> for<00:03:03.480> years<00:03:03.630> and<00:03:03.900> it's<00:03:04.019> changing

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
happened for years and it's changing

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.440 
happened for years and it's changing
well<00:03:05.400> I<00:03:05.519> think<00:03:05.760> it<00:03:06.000> takes<00:03:06.180> a<00:03:06.330> special

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
well I think it takes a special

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.690 
well I think it takes a special
individual<00:03:07.319> to<00:03:07.500> be<00:03:07.650> able<00:03:07.739> to<00:03:07.950> do<00:03:08.250> it<00:03:08.400> and<00:03:08.610> we

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
individual to be able to do it and we

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.030 
individual to be able to do it and we
saw<00:03:08.910> it<00:03:09.090> happened<00:03:09.660> yesterday<00:03:09.810> in<00:03:10.349> the<00:03:10.560> German

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040

fine drawing down in the free post
position<00:05:19.110> I<00:05:19.169> believe<00:05:19.199> down<00:05:19.710> towards<00:05:20.039> the

00:05:20.149 --> 00:05:20.159 
position I believe down towards the

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:23.659 
position I believe down towards the
inside<00:05:20.520> and<00:05:21.020> we<00:05:22.020> know<00:05:22.169> where<00:05:22.379> where<00:05:23.189> he<00:05:23.370> wants

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
inside and we know where where he wants

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:26.899 
inside and we know where where he wants
to<00:05:23.729> be<00:05:23.849> so<00:05:24.330> I<00:05:25.319> think<00:05:25.589> the<00:05:25.860> race<00:05:26.039> on<00:05:26.370> paper<00:05:26.669> is

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:26.909 
to be so I think the race on paper is

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:28.850 
to be so I think the race on paper is
pretty<00:05:27.180> straightforward<00:05:27.509> then<00:05:28.139> going<00:05:28.589> a<00:05:28.680> mile

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
pretty straightforward then going a mile

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.739 
pretty straightforward then going a mile
and<00:05:29.069> a<00:05:29.129> quarter<00:05:29.339> I<00:05:29.520> you<00:05:30.029> know<00:05:30.150> it<00:05:30.539> really

00:05:30.739 --> 00:05:30.749 
and a quarter I you know it really

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:34.189 
and a quarter I you know it really
didn't<00:05:31.169> matter<00:05:31.289> but<00:05:31.620> I<00:05:32.189> I'm<00:05:32.969> pleased<00:05:33.719> that<00:05:34.020> we
