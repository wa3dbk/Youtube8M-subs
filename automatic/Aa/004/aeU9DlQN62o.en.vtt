such as Alvin Ailey

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.880 
such as Alvin Ailey
I<00:00:14.910> studied<00:00:15.420> anthropology<00:00:15.719> in<00:00:16.260> college<00:00:16.680> and

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
I studied anthropology in college and

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.950 
I studied anthropology in college and
from<00:00:17.430> that<00:00:17.699> my<00:00:18.300> interest<00:00:18.660> in<00:00:18.779> photography

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
from that my interest in photography

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.250 
from that my interest in photography
arose<00:00:19.920> because<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:20.460> wanted<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.880> capture

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
arose because I wanted to capture

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.630 
arose because I wanted to capture
indigenous<00:00:22.260> people<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:22.769> their<00:00:22.949> cultures

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
indigenous people and their cultures

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.730 
indigenous people and their cultures
my<00:00:23.880> first<00:00:24.180> experience<00:00:24.660> photographing<00:00:25.529> dance

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
my first experience photographing dance

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.380 
my first experience photographing dance
in<00:00:26.010> theaters<00:00:26.430> was<00:00:26.849> quite<00:00:27.119> challenging

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
in theaters was quite challenging

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.640 
in theaters was quite challenging
because<00:00:27.840> I<00:00:28.019> had<00:00:28.170> never<00:00:28.380> photographed

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
because I had never photographed

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.099 
because I had never photographed
movement<00:00:29.519> so<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.330> would<00:00:30.599> take<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.779> wide-angle

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
movement so I would take a wide-angle

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.260 
movement so I would take a wide-angle
and<00:00:31.650> try<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:31.920> capture<00:00:32.250> just<00:00:32.430> an<00:00:32.730> interesting

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
and try to capture just an interesting

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.709 
and try to capture just an interesting
shape<00:00:33.570> very<00:00:33.989> quickly<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.710> got<00:00:35.219> attracted<00:00:35.790> to

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
shape very quickly I got attracted to

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.619 
shape very quickly I got attracted to
photographing<00:00:37.559> action<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.399> found<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.510> a

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
photographing action and found it a

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.139 
photographing action and found it a
relief<00:00:39.989> from<00:00:40.230> photographing<00:00:41.129> news<00:00:41.700> events

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
relief from photographing news events

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.200 
relief from photographing news events
because<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.350> compositional<00:00:44.070> aspects<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.850> the

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
because the compositional aspects of the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.170 
because the compositional aspects of the
photo<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.750> dance<00:00:46.039> was<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.460> only<00:00:47.640> story<00:00:48.090> I

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
photo of dance was the only story I

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.660 
photo of dance was the only story I
needed<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.690> tell<00:00:48.930> after<00:00:49.590> my<00:00:49.770> early<00:00:50.219> years<00:00:50.489> as<00:00:50.640> a

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
needed to tell after my early years as a

it<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.320> center<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.949> art<00:00:56.820> people

notice<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:57.780> my<00:00:57.899> pictures<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.890> existence<00:00:59.370> of

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
notice in my pictures the existence of

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.139 
notice in my pictures the existence of
the<00:00:59.699> floor<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:01.129> for<00:01:02.129> me<00:01:02.280> it's<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:02.609> important

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
the floor and for me it's so important

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.000 
the floor and for me it's so important
that<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.449> floor<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.809> represented<00:01:04.589> for<00:01:04.979> a

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
that the floor is represented for a

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.550 
that the floor is represented for a
couple<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.400> reasons<00:01:05.580> mainly<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:07.080> these

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
couple of reasons mainly that these

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.170 
couple of reasons mainly that these
photographs<00:01:08.159> actually<00:01:08.340> happened<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.060> the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
photographs actually happened that the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.170 
photographs actually happened that the
dancers<00:01:09.570> were<00:01:09.869> here<00:01:10.200> in<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.560> real<00:01:10.770> place

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
dancers were here in a real place

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.910 
dancers were here in a real place
jumping<00:01:12.180> off<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.689> floor<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.140> landing<00:01:13.500> on<00:01:13.650> the

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
jumping off the floor and landing on the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.420 
jumping off the floor and landing on the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
stripped out in any way I'm known for my

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.429 
stripped out in any way I'm known for my
pictures<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.580> defy<00:01:20.970> gravity<00:01:21.030> but<00:01:21.810> they<00:01:21.990> defy

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
pictures that defy gravity but they defy

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.130 
pictures that defy gravity but they defy
logic<00:01:22.470> as<00:01:23.159> well<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.970> look<00:01:24.240> at<00:01:24.420> one<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.990> these

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
logic as well you look at one of these

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.800 
logic as well you look at one of these
photographs<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.220> seems<00:01:26.490> impossible<00:01:26.880> that

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
photographs and it seems impossible that

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.499 
photographs and it seems impossible that
this<00:01:28.320> actually<00:01:28.860> happened<00:01:29.310> but<00:01:30.180> I'm<00:01:30.299> really

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
this actually happened but I'm really

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.780 
this actually happened but I'm really
photographing<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.619> two<00:01:31.920> thousandth<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.670> a

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
photographing a two thousandth of a

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.569 
photographing a two thousandth of a
second<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.479> that's<00:01:34.259> beneath<00:01:34.680> our<00:01:34.979> threshold

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
second and that's beneath our threshold

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.640 
second and that's beneath our threshold
of<00:01:35.729> perception<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.810> when<00:01:36.990> we<00:01:37.140> look<00:01:37.380> at<00:01:37.500> the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
of perception so when we look at the

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.980 
of perception so when we look at the
photograph<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.549> looks<00:01:39.119> surreal<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.780> looks

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
photograph it looks surreal it looks

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.800 
photograph it looks surreal it looks
impossible<00:01:40.490> but<00:01:41.490> it's<00:01:41.729> absolutely<00:01:42.240> real<00:01:42.479> and

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
impossible but it's absolutely real and

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.560 
impossible but it's absolutely real and
it<00:01:43.590> can<00:01:43.740> only<00:01:43.920> be<00:01:44.310> seen<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.759> experienced

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
it can only be seen and experienced

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.260 
it can only be seen and experienced
through<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.350> photograph<00:01:46.799> prints<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.790> my<00:01:47.820> images

through a photograph prints of my images

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.359 
through a photograph prints of my images
are<00:01:48.420> becoming<00:01:48.810> increasingly<00:01:49.649> important<00:01:50.250> to

are becoming increasingly important to

are becoming increasingly important to
