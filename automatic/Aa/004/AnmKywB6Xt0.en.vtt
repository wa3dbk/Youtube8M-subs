differences here excuse me hi let's put
the<00:06:07.580> brown<00:06:07.760> one<00:06:07.940> because<00:06:08.180> I<00:06:08.240> know<00:06:08.300> that<00:06:08.570> this

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:08.660 
the brown one because I know that this

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.290 
the brown one because I know that this
transition<00:06:09.110> is<00:06:09.350> different<00:06:10.340> than<00:06:10.430> I<00:06:10.790> remember

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
transition is different than I remember

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.220 
transition is different than I remember
last<00:06:11.420> time<00:06:12.940> so<00:06:13.940> here<00:06:14.120> we<00:06:14.210> go<00:06:14.330> we<00:06:14.630> go<00:06:14.990> to<00:06:15.080> the

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:15.230 
last time so here we go we go to the

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.680 
last time so here we go we go to the
menu<00:06:15.530> button<00:06:15.950> and<00:06:16.820> as<00:06:16.940> you<00:06:17.060> can<00:06:17.150> think<00:06:17.330> see

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
menu button and as you can think see

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.420 
menu button and as you can think see
things<00:06:17.960> kind<00:06:18.140> of<00:06:18.230> fade<00:06:18.380> in<00:06:18.530> and<00:06:18.620> out<00:06:18.800> with

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.430 
things kind of fade in and out with

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.840 
things kind of fade in and out with
these<00:06:19.640> transitions<00:06:20.300> I<00:06:21.280> guess<00:06:22.280> it's<00:06:22.490> the<00:06:22.610> same

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:22.850 
these transitions I guess it's the same

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.820 
these transitions I guess it's the same
as<00:06:23.030> the<00:06:23.120> last<00:06:23.240> one<00:06:23.540> but<00:06:23.720> you<00:06:24.140> can<00:06:24.260> set<00:06:24.500> those<00:06:24.620> up
