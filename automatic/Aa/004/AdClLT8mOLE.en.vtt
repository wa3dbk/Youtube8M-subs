00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:10.170
 hello friends with you hoops 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.990
 and today we will discuss the most wonderful 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.450
 In my opinion Fri-Sau fifth level 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.720
 which is literally immediately after the release 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.539
 patch so to speak with the heat of the heat captivated 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.210
 my heart is the most difficult moment in this 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.090
 The review was unstuck from the tablet and 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.369
 go to the actual review itself and do not 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.029
 I doubt that all tonight 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.520
 will hold 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.739
 exactly the map is on this fighter 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.200
 tanks which fully justifies 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.809
 the name of its class and swing on it 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.610
 crew perks in the area of ​​Fri-Sau one 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.530
 pleasure because xp 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.750
 an experienced dock can just take out 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.230
 bags of battles from the fifth to the seventh 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.910
 level inclusive because t49 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.489
 feels confident with almost 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.739
 any scenario unless problems will be 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.289
 appear with specially armored tanks 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.620
 sixth left but you can find on it 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.110
 but let us quickly all the same 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.990
 run through the pros and cons of this 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.570
 birdies the first plus is not even 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.220
 the presence of the tower itself which turns on 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.960
 360 degrees and just awesome dynamics 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.210
 t49 flies on the map at maximum speed in 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.790
 sixty one kilometer per hour what for 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.979
 Fri-Sau indicator well, just beyond the limit 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.590
 and not all light tanks will be able to 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.990
 boast with all this specific 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.759
 engine power is as much as 30 one 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.380
 mare per ton that allows 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.119
 accelerate almost with a slip 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.909
 caterpillars by handwriting 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.710
 el alamein in all battles 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.259
 such mobility allows you to occupy 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.810
 absolutely any vantage point on 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.420
 the middle of the card before it gets there 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.180
 adversary of course if they don't also have 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.189
 team t49 and if suddenly an ally 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.439
 need help on the opposite 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.170
 a diagonal map will take a way there 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.530
 just a couple of tens of seconds but in 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.590
 such mobility has its drawbacks as 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.750
 and in the case of t2 light on t49 perfectly 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.270
 I do not want to stop and therefore 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.060
 almost every fight in the very beginning I 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.640
 I try to beat myself in the head oops not 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.750
 rush yours for t no armor you 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.870
 merge 100 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.010
 then leave you well and stuff like that 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.100
 you know it really is very strong 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.080
 helps mobility t49 necessary 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.330
 use for instant borrowing 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.640
 key positions throughout the fight 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.650
 they are maneuverable for some tactics 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.140
 the thing is that turning 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.570
 The hull is only 32 degrees in 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.520
 second rate is certainly good but 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.890
 for such a powerful engine clearly 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.570
 insufficient but in place when you 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.480
 reached on the screen of his tablet 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.580
 move strictly to the left or to the right t49 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.190
 able to withstand fast st 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.500
 who try to twist you hope 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.050
 shoot the ammo or engine a 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.600
 so my advice is very clear 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.940
 to rush on this fri sau only need 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.500
 for the last surviving enemy or 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.989
 repulsed from becoming an enemy 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.670
 lone hero can also get 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.980
 large portion of pleasure from 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.160
 twisting sluggish opponents 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.410
 example t-150 or everybody there churchill and 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.480
 burn them should be more serious 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.320
 because with and spun not easy or 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.560
 medium tank 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.519
 there is still anti-tank self-propelled 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.470
 the most important factor 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.750
 because of which you should not break out to 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.060
 the enemy in the brazen is very 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.940
 low body booking if u 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.590
 previous tank in branch m81 armor 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.989
 consists of coarse buns for 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.450
 hot dogs here I don't even know what 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.670
 compare it with the thickest part of armor 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.980
 is only 25 millimeters 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.630
 you can even take the line and 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.820
 see how little it is 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.269
 compared with even 8 centimeters 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:47.370
 German stuff sewn nine absolutely 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.320
 everything anywhere except mask 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.320
 guns can catch machine gun 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.390
 from stock a-20 but this is not a fact 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.519
 so remember that you not only will 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.769
 very confident losing his points 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:01.440
 strength but you will be very varnish and 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:03.450
 target for the opponent especially the more it will be 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.180
 fear your tank because words 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.930
 bend it t49 flies ahead of this 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.170
 self-propelled gun 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.079
 and she deservedly besides excellent 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:16.200
 mobility t49 has one of the most 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:18.390
 comfortable and dangerous guns on the fifth 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.910
 level among colleagues in anti-tank 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.280
 the shop first need to still 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.070
 pay tribute to the presence of a full tower 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.380
 which 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.150
 can be rotated 360 degrees 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.920
 apart from the lack of need 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.050
 turn the corps of us Tatar 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.390
 distances which greatly increases 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.880
 scatter guns tower has another 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.800
 very important aspect for pt suet 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.870
 surely everyone knows that the mask network 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.400
 which adds 25 percent 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.040
 masking effect only on 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.900
 fixed tanks so that's when all 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.880
 signed the rest and broke it on the fifth 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.900
 excepting, well, still valve Rena which 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.630
 there is also a tower 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:55.150
 will be forced to lose this bonus at 2 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.670
 body mouth even standing still 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.890
 most at risk of being noticed when 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.480
 Our today's hero can confidently 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:04.000
 continue firing 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.680
 and he does this troy not great for 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.980
 that there is no rock respect among 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.020
 lovers of absolutely all classes 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:13.810
 alpha damage in t49 is not inferior 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.210
 to colleagues and is 160 units what 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.850
 is pretty weighty plop oh for 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.500
 tanks 5 left while indicators 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.120
 rate of fire is already almost 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.610
 ten shells a minute that is 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.550
 recharge is only 6 seconds a 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.830
 considering the fact that you can load on t49 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.960
 a box of cola rammer and a shot of adrenaline 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.120
 then for a short time you can 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.190
 turn into a minigun which is capable 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.530
 scatter opponents left to right 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.840
 and considering again the tower 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.820
 magnificent declination angle of the gun at 10 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.770
 degrees and excellent masking 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.780
 it can be done absolutely not 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.090
 straining at middle distance 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.620
 wherever non-penetration falls so much 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.900
 his though one hundred and twenty eight 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.360
 millimeters which is absolutely enough for everything 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.920
 tanks 5 lire I even in the forehead of course if 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.340
 only strands will not turn their 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.310
 body 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:03.940
 but in the case of t49 we are talking about comfort 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:05.860
 in battles 6 even 7 left la and therefore Vasiti 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.500
 Still, with a dozen of sabots 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:10.680
 shells just in case that's what 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.150
 As for information, I decided not to put 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.280
 reinforced aiming drives because 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:17.500
 mixing in 1 and 7 by itself is pretty 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.050
 comfortable and does not require mandatory 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.630
 drive improvements for myself setup i 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.700
 personally chose such a messenger network net 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:27.550
 and a stereo tube which allows 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:29.530
 increase the view to 290 meters that 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.500
 allows you to heat the karma of commanders 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.980
 enemy technology at high temperature 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:36.710
 because i see them a 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.960
 I, respectively, do not have here and guess 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.550
 where do they shoot at them because 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.490
 practice shows that the mafia 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:45.800
 shelling directions see not yet 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:48.230
 one controversial aspect of the gun is 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:51.260
 pretty mediocre accuracy 041 

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:54.440
 which does not allow confident sniping 

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:56.900
 on a long distance but on t49 similar 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:59.030
 I don’t really want things 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.430
 to do when you can effectively 

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:02.150
 give out your rays good and on average 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.580
 distances 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:07.040
 again remaining undetected and by 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:10.430
 its light not sharing allies 

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:12.170
 half of the income and experience that I can 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.720
 say about this fri sau 

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:17.630
 it must necessarily have 

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:20.630
 I am each tanker in his hangar 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:22.700
 I will leave it to myself for rest and straightening 

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:25.190
 stats because not on every tank 

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:28.850
 manages to be so confident 

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:31.730
 how on t49 in general my advice is mast hev 

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:34.190
 without further ado do not forget to put 

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.900
 Like if you like my review 

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:38.810
 and share it with your friends 

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:41.210
 Well, on this I would all like 

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:43.640
 tell about t49 more and more but 

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:45.950
 fingers whine very much and so 

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:48.650
 asks to let them control this and 

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:51.110
 wonderful fri-sau and you 

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:54.250
 huvs subscribe to my channel and up 

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:54.250
 see you soon friends
