00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.509
 hello how are you all welcome to a 

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:06.640
 new video I am is cross and the video of 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:09.430
 it's about how to warm up the shoulders 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.500
 correctly most people do not 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:14.190
 it is they do and why 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:18.869
 which ends up hurting the shoulders 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:22.349
 so that's the way I've done it already 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.930
 for several years and then I think that 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.820
 the correct one so to begin with they 're going to 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.410
 do this exercise not this exercise 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.689
 concentrates on heating the part 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.510
 central shoulder the central part is 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.730
 a very delicate part is a part that 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.960
 almost nobody hot because that's where it 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.020
 goes all the attention when doing exercise 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.870
 it's like the 20 press takes all the 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.270
 attention and then if you have heated the 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.570
 other three parts and they are not born as is 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.570
 a great risk of hurting you so 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.909
 we will start with that exercise we are going to 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.030
 warm up in that central part we're going to 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:01:00.039
 do who follows 25 repetitions 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.300
 so I 'm looking for a weight with which you do not 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:03.190
 It costs work to make reflections 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.110
 here we are not looking to create mass 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.049
 muscle in anything like that always 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.090
 we are heating the muscles and in 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:12.700
 special this part is very delicate so 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:16.330
 be careful with the weight you can 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.940
 hurt so it's going to be 20 15 to 25 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.830
 repetitions two sets and the sets for 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.950
 to be continuous is going to be first an arm 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:27.710
 of lotus when you finish that you will do the 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.360
 again and again the other when finishing 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.030
 let's heat the sides 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.740
 of the shoulder this exercise because it is a 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.290
 exercise that I think most of 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.330
 you have it in your routine and so 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.820
 here we are going to do from 15 to 25 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.060
 repetitions equal a light weight here 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:48.800
 I'm using 10 pounds or 15 to 25 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:52.369
 repetitions and then to try not to do 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:55.190
 less than 15 it can be more than 15 yo 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:58.280
 I think it's okay if it can be 30 is 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.630
 Well, go ahead as you go 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.219
 feeling other muscles 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.920
 here what we are going to do is going to be a 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.780
 super set let's combine the exercise 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.149
 of the sides with the frontals and 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.120
 then the backs and then again the 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.330
 exercise to warm the central part 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.709
 of the shoulder without rest so I finished 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.730
 from the sides here watching the 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.680
 front and then 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.590
 and then when it was finished it could be the 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.409
 back and then do again the 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.569
 central when I finish I'll go back to 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:32.360
 repeat everything because they are going to do my two 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:36.080
 super set sets 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:39.340
 and it would be all 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.800
 since this warm up I recommend you 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.500
 Too much you do it every day 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.660
 that you train less than the legs 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:52.880
 I mean the chest back arms 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:57.560
 shoulder blast at the start of your day of 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:00.080
 arms already back and chest and you're going 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:04.040
 see a big difference at the moment of 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:06.500
 start loading the weight since so 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.200
 regular not warm the chest and then those 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.570
 parts of the shoulders continue farÃ­as and 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.830
 believe me it makes a big difference 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.200
 strength will increase too 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.680
 and then sculpts that sound of 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.379
 observe 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.450
 so I hope this video generates that 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:24.489
 the facebook page 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.739
 subscribe to the youtube channel and you can 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:30.659
 walk with intensity since that is the 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.659
 key to all this until soon
