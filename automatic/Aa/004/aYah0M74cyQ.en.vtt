so<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:25.770> can<00:01:25.890> fight<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.280> program<00:01:26.759> from<00:01:27.270> the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
so you can fight the program from the

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.940 
so you can fight the program from the
inside<00:01:28.009> okay<00:01:29.009> pink<00:01:29.790> matrix<00:01:30.420> only<00:01:31.140> with<00:01:31.560> even

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
inside okay pink matrix only with even

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.920 
inside okay pink matrix only with even
less<00:01:32.130> logic<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.240> what's<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.810> most
