up
and<00:01:18.970> suppose<00:01:19.970> into<00:01:20.240> like<00:01:20.390> ten<00:01:20.630> seconds<00:01:21.020> of<00:01:21.110> it

I<00:01:25.220> was<00:01:25.610> trying<00:01:25.820> to<00:01:25.850> mess<00:01:26.240> around<00:01:26.390> with<00:01:26.690> the

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
I was trying to mess around with the

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.500 
I was trying to mess around with the
different<00:01:27.020> chords<00:01:27.410> and<00:01:27.860> the<00:01:28.190> notes<00:01:29.060> on<00:01:29.270> here

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
different chords and the notes on here

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.080 
different chords and the notes on here
see<00:01:30.020> if<00:01:30.080> I'd<00:01:30.170> find<00:01:30.440> out<00:01:30.790> different<00:01:31.790> ones<00:01:31.970> that

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
see if I'd find out different ones that

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.880 
see if I'd find out different ones that
fit<00:01:32.570> together<00:01:32.690> to<00:01:33.050> make<00:01:33.200> it<00:01:33.260> sound<00:01:33.470> like<00:01:33.650> it

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
fit together to make it sound like it

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.600 
fit together to make it sound like it
but<00:01:34.070> when<00:01:34.729> you<00:01:34.820> play<00:01:34.970> the<00:01:35.030> chords

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.910 

they<00:01:40.180> are<00:01:40.330> low<00:01:40.570> enough<00:01:40.600> to<00:01:41.260> match<00:01:41.470> the<00:01:41.770> base

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
they are low enough to match the base

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.670 
they are low enough to match the base
but<00:01:42.580> at<00:01:43.150> the<00:01:43.240> same<00:01:43.420> time<00:01:43.660> they're<00:01:44.260> really

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
but at the same time they're really

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.950 
but at the same time they're really
muffled<00:01:45.190> and<00:01:45.430> they<00:01:46.180> just<00:01:46.330> don't<00:01:46.510> really<00:01:46.600> blend

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
muffled and they just don't really blend

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.230 
muffled and they just don't really blend
very<00:01:47.050> well<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:48.430> you<00:01:48.520> can't<00:01:48.730> really<00:01:48.850> tell<00:01:49.000> them

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
very well and you can't really tell them

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.580 
very well and you can't really tell them
apart<00:01:49.330> eventually<00:01:49.660> once<00:01:50.050> you<00:01:50.140> start<00:01:50.410> playing

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
apart eventually once you start playing

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.440 
apart eventually once you start playing
too<00:01:50.920> many<00:01:51.100> in<00:01:51.250> a<00:01:51.340> row<00:01:51.370> too<00:01:51.820> fast<00:01:52.090> and<00:01:52.390> so<00:01:53.290> then<00:01:53.530> I

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
too many in a row too fast and so then I

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
too many in a row too fast and so then I
found<00:01:55.450> out<00:01:55.630> that<00:01:55.690> when<00:01:55.900> you<00:01:55.960> play<00:01:56.110> single

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
found out that when you play single

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.929 
found out that when you play single
notes

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.109 

there's<00:02:00.630> all<00:02:00.780> our<00:02:00.899> clarity<00:02:01.490> and<00:02:02.490> they<00:02:02.700> sound<00:02:02.999> a

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
there's all our clarity and they sound a

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.620 
there's all our clarity and they sound a
lot<00:02:03.240> better<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.859> so<00:02:04.859> I<00:02:05.219> thought<00:02:05.700> she'd<00:02:06.479> raise

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
lot better and so I thought she'd raise

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.979 
lot better and so I thought she'd raise
the<00:02:06.840> octave<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.499> song<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.450> maybe<00:02:09.450> yes<00:02:09.690> I

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
the octave of the song and maybe yes I

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.619 
the octave of the song and maybe yes I
could<00:02:10.349> get<00:02:10.530> some<00:02:10.679> notes<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:11.299> to<00:02:12.299> each<00:02:12.450> other

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
could get some notes that to each other

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.280 
could get some notes that to each other
are<00:02:13.580> close<00:02:14.580> that<00:02:15.030> if<00:02:15.180> they're<00:02:15.390> lowered<00:02:15.840> then

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
are close that if they're lowered then

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.190 
are close that if they're lowered then
they<00:02:16.440> would<00:02:16.560> make<00:02:16.819> the<00:02:17.819> bass<00:02:18.569> riff<00:02:18.840> off<00:02:19.019> the

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
they would make the bass riff off the

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:31.640 
they would make the bass riff off the
song<00:02:19.459> it's<00:02:20.459> all<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:20.670> got<00:02:20.700> this<00:02:30.319> and<00:02:31.319> while<00:02:31.470> it's

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
song it's all I got this and while it's

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.530 
song it's all I got this and while it's
not<00:02:31.739> you<00:02:32.430> know<00:02:32.489> doesn't<00:02:32.760> time<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.030> exact<00:02:33.299> same

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
not you know doesn't time the exact same

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.900 
not you know doesn't time the exact same
because<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.260> actual<00:02:34.950> part<00:02:35.340> of<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.459> song<00:02:35.700> is

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
because the actual part of the song is

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.500 
because the actual part of the song is
the<00:02:35.940> base<00:02:36.360> so<00:02:36.780> it's<00:02:36.930> really<00:02:37.530> low<00:02:37.739> but<00:02:38.730> that's

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
the base so it's really low but that's

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.170 
the base so it's really low but that's
the<00:02:39.660> closest<00:02:39.959> you're<00:02:40.110> gonna<00:02:40.200> get<00:02:40.470> on<00:02:40.799> that<00:02:41.180> and

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
the closest you're gonna get on that and

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.500 
the closest you're gonna get on that and
I<00:02:42.360> thought<00:02:42.660> I<00:02:43.019> was<00:02:43.739> pretty<00:02:43.829> cool<00:02:44.129> I<00:02:44.420> you<00:02:45.420> know
