00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
going to do a camera test we're going to

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.480 
going to do a camera test we're going to
do<00:00:21.359> an<00:00:21.449> app<00:00:21.600> multitasking<00:00:22.320> switch<00:00:22.619> test<00:00:22.949> and

we're<00:00:23.609> just<00:00:23.760> going<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:23.910> do<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.150> general

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
we're just going to do a general

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.380 
we're just going to do a general
performance<00:00:24.810> test<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.650> iPhone<00:00:26.010> 4s<00:00:26.340> on<00:00:26.670> 8.2

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390

so<00:00:27.900> if<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.019> want<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.230> see<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.529> stick<00:00:28.800> around

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
so if you want to see that stick around

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.040 
so if you want to see that stick around
for<00:00:29.220> this<00:00:29.310> video<00:00:29.550> guys<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.789> let's<00:00:30.689> dive<00:00:30.869> right

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
for this video guys and let's dive right

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.690 
for this video guys and let's dive right
in<00:00:31.230> right<00:00:31.470> now<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.279> we're<00:00:32.369> going<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.520> begin

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
in right now so we're going to begin

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.209 
in right now so we're going to begin
this<00:00:32.969> video<00:00:33.239> by<00:00:33.450> booting<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.930> iPhone<00:00:34.440> 4s<00:00:34.800> up

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
this video by booting the iPhone 4s up

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.819 
this video by booting the iPhone 4s up
and<00:00:35.430> as<00:00:35.520> you<00:00:35.640> can<00:00:35.700> see<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:36.360> booted<00:00:36.570> up<00:00:36.780> from<00:00:37.710> the

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
and as you can see it booted up from the

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.440 
and as you can see it booted up from the
time<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.040> hit<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.340> power<00:00:38.550> button<00:00:38.610> pretty

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
time I hit the power button pretty

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.180 
time I hit the power button pretty
quickly<00:00:39.690> but<00:00:40.079> it's<00:00:40.530> going<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.770> take<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> while

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
quickly but it's going to take a while

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.100 
quickly but it's going to take a while
so<00:00:41.430> I'm<00:00:41.520> going<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.730> skip<00:00:42.000> over<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.540> end<00:00:42.780> of

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
so I'm going to skip over to the end of

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.090 
so I'm going to skip over to the end of
this<00:00:43.410> boot<00:00:43.770> up

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
this boot up

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.850 
this boot up
so<00:00:44.940> about<00:00:45.210> 33<00:00:45.719> seconds<00:00:46.110> later<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.530> can<00:00:46.680> see

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
so about 33 seconds later you can see

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.060 
so about 33 seconds later you can see
the<00:00:46.980> iPhone<00:00:47.100> 4<00:00:47.520> has<00:00:47.610> finally<00:00:48.059> booted<00:00:48.420> up<00:00:49.070> so

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
the iPhone 4 has finally booted up so

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.500 
the iPhone 4 has finally booted up so
now<00:00:50.190> we're<00:00:50.370> going<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.550> go<00:00:50.670> on<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.329> app

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
now we're going to go on to the app

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.869 
now we're going to go on to the app
switching<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.649> multitasking<00:00:53.280> test<00:00:53.550> so<00:00:53.730> we're

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
switching and multitasking test so we're

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.400 
switching and multitasking test so we're
going<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.030> start<00:00:54.300> by<00:00:54.510> hopping<00:00:54.750> over<00:00:54.989> into

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
going to start by hopping over into

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.500 
going to start by hopping over into
messages<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.129> can<00:00:56.160> see<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:57.180> opened<00:00:57.480> up

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
messages and you can see that opened up

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.910 
messages and you can see that opened up
relatively<00:00:57.930> quickly<00:00:58.109> now<00:00:58.559> we're<00:00:58.649> going<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.829> go

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
relatively quickly now we're going to go

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.950 
relatively quickly now we're going to go
into<00:00:59.010> calendar<00:00:59.460> that<00:01:00.149> also<00:01:00.210> opened<00:01:00.899> up

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
into calendar that also opened up

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.270 
into calendar that also opened up
relatively<00:01:01.379> quickly<00:01:01.530> we're<00:01:01.980> going<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.160> happen

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
relatively quickly we're going to happen

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.240 
relatively quickly we're going to happen
the<00:01:02.520> phone<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:03.059> was<00:01:03.180> pretty<00:01:03.390> quick<00:01:03.660> as<00:01:03.840> well

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
the phone that was pretty quick as well

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.219 
the phone that was pretty quick as well
notes<00:01:05.330> as<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.450> can<00:01:06.600> see<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.080> app

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
notes as you can see that the app

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.530 
notes as you can see that the app
switching<00:01:07.830> speeds<00:01:08.220> are<00:01:08.400> actually<00:01:09.000> performing

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
switching speeds are actually performing

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.840 
switching speeds are actually performing
quite<00:01:09.840> well<00:01:10.010> there<00:01:11.010> actually<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.640> little

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
quite well there actually is a little

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.750 
quite well there actually is a little
bit<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.270> frame<00:01:12.780> rate<00:01:13.409> delay<00:01:13.830> I've<00:01:14.100> noticed

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
bit of a frame rate delay I've noticed

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.310 
bit of a frame rate delay I've noticed
when<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:15.000> was<00:01:15.180> actually<00:01:15.390> there<00:01:15.990> might<00:01:16.080> be<00:01:16.140> not

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
when I was actually there might be not

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.630 
when I was actually there might be not
be<00:01:16.470> picking<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:16.770> up<00:01:16.830> in<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.040> video<00:01:17.159> but<00:01:17.490> in

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
be picking this up in the video but in

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.130 
be picking this up in the video but in
real<00:01:17.820> life<00:01:17.880> performance<00:01:18.570> there's<00:01:18.840> actually<00:01:19.110> a

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
real life performance there's actually a

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.350 
real life performance there's actually a
little<00:01:19.290> bit<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.530> framerate<00:01:19.890> delay<00:01:20.460> the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
little bit of a framerate delay the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.300 
little bit of a framerate delay the
games<00:01:21.659> on<00:01:21.930> this<00:01:22.080> iPhone<00:01:22.229> 4s<00:01:22.740> actually

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
games on this iPhone 4s actually

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.490 
games on this iPhone 4s actually
performed<00:01:23.759> quite<00:01:23.970> well<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.390> smooth<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.470> you

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
performed quite well and smooth so you

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.719 
performed quite well and smooth so you
don't<00:01:25.799> really<00:01:25.979> have<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.340> worry<00:01:26.520> too<00:01:26.700> much

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
don't really have to worry too much

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.910 
don't really have to worry too much
about<00:01:26.880> games<00:01:27.360> bonds<00:01:27.689> are<00:01:27.930> not<00:01:28.080> high-end<00:01:28.590> games

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
about games bonds are not high-end games

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.700 
about games bonds are not high-end games
like<00:01:29.189> Infinity<00:01:29.759> Blade<00:01:29.939> or<00:01:30.780> Grand<00:01:31.320> Theft<00:01:31.470> Auto

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
like Infinity Blade or Grand Theft Auto

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.850 
like Infinity Blade or Grand Theft Auto
or<00:01:32.070> something<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.729> an<00:01:33.570> RPG<00:01:34.110> nature<00:01:34.650> something

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
or something of an RPG nature something

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.069 
or something of an RPG nature something
that's<00:01:35.130> very<00:01:35.310> high<00:01:35.850> intense<00:01:36.270> graphic<00:01:36.840> things

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
that's very high intense graphic things

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.740 
that's very high intense graphic things
like<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.560> but<00:01:38.250> more<00:01:38.670> likely<00:01:38.909> activity<00:01:39.570> games

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
like that but more likely activity games

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.789 
like that but more likely activity games
are<00:01:39.900> going<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.049> be<00:01:40.140> fine

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
are going to be fine

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.109 
are going to be fine
so<00:01:41.280> now<00:01:41.400> we're<00:01:41.549> going<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.729> hop<00:01:41.820> over<00:01:41.939> into

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
so now we're going to hop over into

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.670 
so now we're going to hop over into
Google<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.720> might<00:01:42.930> see<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.170> little<00:01:43.380> bit<00:01:43.619> of

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
Google and you might see a little bit of

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.109 
Google and you might see a little bit of
lag<00:01:43.829> here<00:01:44.070> as<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.310> can<00:01:44.369> see<00:01:44.490> I'm<00:01:44.729> scrolling

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
lag here as you can see I'm scrolling

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.760 
lag here as you can see I'm scrolling
and<00:01:45.450> we're<00:01:45.540> not<00:01:45.630> seeing<00:01:45.960> anything<00:01:46.170> happening

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
and we're not seeing anything happening

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.249 
and we're not seeing anything happening
so<00:01:47.009> there<00:01:47.640> was<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.820> just<00:01:48.119> justification<00:01:49.110> of

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
so there was a just justification of

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.039 
so there was a just justification of
that<00:01:49.290> there<00:01:49.680> still<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.159> lag<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:50.759> iOS<00:01:51.060> 8.2<00:01:51.720> for

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
that there still is lag in iOS 8.2 for

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.069 
that there still is lag in iOS 8.2 for
the<00:01:52.110> iPhone<00:01:52.500> 4s<00:01:53.149> typing<00:01:54.149> speed<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.570> actually

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
the iPhone 4s typing speed is actually

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.190 
the iPhone 4s typing speed is actually
pretty<00:01:55.890> darn<00:01:56.610> good<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.270> we're<00:01:58.049> going<00:01:58.170> to

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
pretty darn good and we're going to

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.690 
pretty darn good and we're going to
close<00:01:58.409> out<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.680> multitasking<00:01:59.369> right<00:01:59.520> here

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
close out the multitasking right here

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.730 
close out the multitasking right here
and<00:01:59.880> you<00:01:59.969> can<00:02:00.119> see<00:02:00.299> those<00:02:00.570> perform<00:02:01.079> quite<00:02:01.469> well

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
and you can see those perform quite well

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.130 
and you can see those perform quite well
as<00:02:01.920> well<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.670> general<00:02:03.479> performance<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.079> would

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
as well so general performance I would

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.780 
as well so general performance I would
give<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.469> an<00:02:04.560> 8<00:02:04.590> out<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:04.920> 10<00:02:05.219> if<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.460> want<00:02:05.549> to

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
give it an 8 out of 10 if you want to

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.490 
give it an 8 out of 10 if you want to
talk<00:02:05.909> about<00:02:05.939> on<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.299> scale<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:06.750> 1<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:06.960> 10<00:02:07.110> it's

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
talk about on a scale of 1 to 10 it's

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.370 
talk about on a scale of 1 to 10 it's
not<00:02:08.009> going<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.280> be<00:02:08.369> too<00:02:08.550> bad<00:02:08.729> for<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.060> guys

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
not going to be too bad for you guys

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.080 
not going to be too bad for you guys
but<00:02:09.620> don't<00:02:09.830> expect<00:02:09.950> no<00:02:10.370> modern-day

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
but don't expect no modern-day

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.960 
but don't expect no modern-day
super-quick<00:02:11.840> iphone<00:02:12.290> six-plus<00:02:12.620> speeds<00:02:13.160> but

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
super-quick iphone six-plus speeds but

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.490 
super-quick iphone six-plus speeds but
if<00:02:14.330> you<00:02:14.480> ain't<00:02:14.540> got<00:02:14.690> that<00:02:14.780> much<00:02:14.960> money<00:02:14.990> this<00:02:15.380> is

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
if you ain't got that much money this is

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.220 
if you ain't got that much money this is
going<00:02:15.650> to<00:02:15.710> be<00:02:15.800> a<00:02:15.830> good<00:02:16.010> phone<00:02:16.220> for<00:02:16.430> you<00:02:17.020> so<00:02:18.020> this

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
going to be a good phone for you so this

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.600 
going to be a good phone for you so this
last<00:02:18.440> test<00:02:18.740> we're<00:02:18.950> going<00:02:19.040> to<00:02:19.100> go<00:02:19.250> over<00:02:19.280> the

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
last test we're going to go over the

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.270 
last test we're going to go over the
camera<00:02:20.000> for<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.300> iPhone<00:02:20.780> 4s<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:21.770> as<00:02:22.040> you<00:02:22.160> can

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
camera for the iPhone 4s and as you can

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.280 
camera for the iPhone 4s and as you can
see<00:02:22.340> it<00:02:22.610> opened<00:02:23.000> up<00:02:23.060> relatively<00:02:23.630> quickly<00:02:23.780> so

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
see it opened up relatively quickly so

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.960 
see it opened up relatively quickly so
that's<00:02:24.470> pretty<00:02:24.680> much<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:25.010> case<00:02:25.220> with<00:02:25.520> iPhone

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
that's pretty much the case with iPhone

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.730 
that's pretty much the case with iPhone
4s<00:02:26.240> things<00:02:26.540> open<00:02:26.810> up<00:02:26.870> quickly<00:02:27.170> although<00:02:27.500> they

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
4s things open up quickly although they

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.190 
4s things open up quickly although they
don't<00:02:27.920> open<00:02:28.070> up<00:02:28.280> super<00:02:28.760> smoothly<00:02:29.180> so<00:02:30.080> you're

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
don't open up super smoothly so you're

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.510 
don't open up super smoothly so you're
going<00:02:30.320> to<00:02:30.380> notice<00:02:30.530> if<00:02:30.770> you<00:02:30.830> have<00:02:30.920> a<00:02:30.950> iPhone<00:02:31.280> for

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
going to notice if you have a iPhone for

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.910 
going to notice if you have a iPhone for
us<00:02:31.640> even<00:02:31.880> with<00:02:32.000> this<00:02:32.090> 8.2<00:02:32.810> update<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.680> things

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
us even with this 8.2 update the things

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.760 
us even with this 8.2 update the things
open<00:02:34.250> up<00:02:34.630> pretty<00:02:35.630> quickly<00:02:35.930> but<00:02:36.230> not<00:02:36.380> super

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
open up pretty quickly but not super

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.800 
open up pretty quickly but not super
soon<00:02:37.010> and<00:02:37.580> as<00:02:37.700> you<00:02:37.820> can<00:02:37.940> see<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.240> shots<00:02:38.570> are

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
soon and as you can see the shots are

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.620 
soon and as you can see the shots are
pretty<00:02:39.140> good<00:02:39.290> but<00:02:39.860> like<00:02:40.280> I<00:02:40.400> say<00:02:40.550> no<00:02:40.730> 64<00:02:41.300> bit<00:02:41.480> but

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
pretty good but like I say no 64 bit but

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.160 
pretty good but like I say no 64 bit but
you<00:02:41.960> know<00:02:42.110> the<00:02:42.440> specs<00:02:42.800> do<00:02:43.070> not<00:02:43.250> match<00:02:43.960> 64<00:02:44.960> bits

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
you know the specs do not match 64 bits

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.690 
you know the specs do not match 64 bits
so<00:02:45.320> I<00:02:45.380> don't<00:02:45.530> expect<00:02:45.710> it<00:02:46.130> it's<00:02:46.280> just<00:02:46.400> pretty

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
so I don't expect it it's just pretty

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.950 
so I don't expect it it's just pretty
common<00:02:47.120> sense<00:02:47.360> that<00:02:47.540> you're<00:02:47.630> not<00:02:47.660> going<00:02:47.900> to

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
common sense that you're not going to

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.720 
common sense that you're not going to
have<00:02:48.050> the<00:02:48.170> greatest<00:02:48.410> speed<00:02:48.770> out<00:02:48.980> there<00:02:49.010> but

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
have the greatest speed out there but

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.310 
have the greatest speed out there but
it's<00:02:49.880> still<00:02:50.090> a<00:02:50.150> very<00:02:50.270> passable<00:02:51.020> phone

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
it's still a very passable phone

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.110 
it's still a very passable phone
especially<00:02:51.920> for<00:02:52.070> being<00:02:52.220> almost<00:02:52.460> four<00:02:52.910> years

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
especially for being almost four years

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.060 
especially for being almost four years
old<00:02:53.420> now<00:02:53.540> I<00:02:53.660> mean<00:02:54.020> the<00:02:54.170> phone<00:02:54.410> was<00:02:54.590> released<00:02:54.740> in

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
old now I mean the phone was released in

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.550 
old now I mean the phone was released in
2011

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560

2011
syria's<00:02:57.560> you<00:02:57.680> can<00:02:57.830> see<00:02:58.040> it<00:02:58.100> works<00:02:58.340> pretty<00:02:59.240> well

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
syria's you can see it works pretty well

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.020 
syria's you can see it works pretty well
