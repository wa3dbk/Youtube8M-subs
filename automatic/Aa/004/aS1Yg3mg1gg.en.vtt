00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.330
 you have your website and you know you need 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.219
 have traffic but not any traffic 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.679
 you need to have the right traffic to 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:13.200
 what your small medium or large offers 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.780
 company so you can add the amount 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.820
 of contacts and clients and surely 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.730
 this talk about online advertising 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.160
 surely google and facebook but 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.950
 how they work what advantages can you give 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.050
 each one to my company and how can they 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.050
 serve you let's see it 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.670
 this is the scenario you have a website 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.100
 with a product or service that you want 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.920
 promote and a very good way to 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.409
 doing it is paying traffic or not 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.659
 natural you should always consider this 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:54.210
 option if we recover what 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:56.940
 inverted internet is the most 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.339
 cheap and measurable and I'm going to 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.829
 explain why for example if you do 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:03.719
 an advertisement in a magazine your company 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.760
 will spend a lot of money and never 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.740
 you will know for sure 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.080
 only roughly and so you 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.260
 the seller says how many people see the 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.990
 notice and if they are contacted thanks to that in 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.120
 internet you can measure exactly how much 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.400
 has spent how many people approached the 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.370
 campaign and what objectives were met or 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.320
 no and in what quantities do we go to the 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.840
 online advertising and let's start with 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.210
 google google offers us different 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.490
 campaign types the most basic and 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.010
 recognized is advertising in its network 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.810
 search is that you notice 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.150
 appear the results of the 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.790
 searches for words or phrases that 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.740
 you are interested to be able to direct well 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.680
 our warnings you have to make a 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.060
 keyword analysis if you do not know 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.460
 what I'm talking about 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.190
 I recommend that you see our section of 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.770
 initial videos the one that deals with the 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.440
 words and key phrases then 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.660
 going back to our subject for example if 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.520
 your company offers golf shoes you can 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.830
 make your notice show when a 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.619
 person does a search related to 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.400
 That notice will appear somewhere 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.560
 of the sector that we see in red 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.300
 It should be clarified that the results 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.460
 always going to present this 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.500
 way since google is changing as 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.960
 presents them but we can be sure 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.910
 that with this graphic you give an idea of 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.550
 what we are talking about surely 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.400
 you will ask how much it costs me to appear 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.070
 there and appear I tell you that it does not cost 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.080
 nothing google shows your free ad but 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.800
 It charges you when someone makes you 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.050
 click and go to your website then if I 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.470
 they make many clicks I can melt it will be 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:46.260
 your question not when setting up the campaign 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.940
 decide how much you want to spend per day 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.850
 notice is displayed until the clicks 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.890
 reach the daily limit then they are left 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.200
 to show up the next day besides 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.360
 you can pause the campaign when you want 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.790
 other important things to have in 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.860
 account when setting up the campaign is in 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.470
 what kind of devices do you want to be 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.440
 show the notices during what times 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.390
 and in the geographic location specific to 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.580
 what do you want to address 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.500
 another question you can ask is in what 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.530
 position I will appear with respect to 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.110
 other notices and that depends as 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.880
 Google categorize your ad and it depends 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.860
 of many factors such as for example 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.080
 how much cool to pay for the click with 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.060
 with respect to your competitors or what 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.580
 related to the search to your 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.410
 landing page inclusive if you're 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.540
 bidding on a word with a lot 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.700
 competition the click can become 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.440
 more expensive than what you offer and then you 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:43.140
 notice will not show the display network 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.209
 it's another way to advertise but 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.400
 not in the searches that are done in 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.580
 google directly but using 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.430
 banners on sites associated with google 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.230
 these sites are classified by types of 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.480
 Content according to a classification 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.209
 fixed or according to the words that 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.550
 In their texts, the place where they 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.280
 shows and your ad is published receives a 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.709
 part of the google profit come to 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.620
 do something like partners in this type 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.480
 of advertising is also google offers 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.040
 Advertising on videos shown 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.229
 on youtube and the videos that are 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.109
 in all cases you have to analyze the 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:22.930
 return on investment for example if 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.180
 you see a thousand people of those thousand people 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.639
 click on the 100 warning and of those 100 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.979
 they make you the action you want only 5 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:32.169
 you have to compare the profit you get 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:34.330
 generate those 5 with the investment in the 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.759
 advertising and so you will see if it 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.889
 justifies the investment, it should be clarified that 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:40.930
 There may be recurring buyers or 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:43.780
 recidivists that increase your profit to 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.150
 future or what you are looking for are not 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.970
 buyers but contacts and prospects 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.520
 for future marketing actions the 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.370
 case of facebook is totally different 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.320
 Many people ask me what 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.900
 How can this social network serve them? 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.490
 since they consider that people like that are 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.560
 distracting pse or wasting time 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.630
 looking at things that have nothing to do with 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.490
 your work and it turns out to do 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.340
 Advertising on Facebook can be a lot 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.229
 more powerful even than in google or not all 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.509
 It depends on what we want to advertise 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:14.460
 we're going to see that in the second part 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:16.919
 of this video 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.229
 and the great advantage of this social network is 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:21.509
 that offers us a very powerful level of 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:24.000
 audience segmentation and we can 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:25.860
 determine much more accurately the 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.050
 specific public that is going to 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.840
 directing our advertising action 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.310
 we can also capture not only 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.789
 sending the user to our website 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.349
 but if we simply manage to make a 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:40.050
 I like it on our facebook page 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:41.819
 we are going to have it within reach of the 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.130
 hand permanently since when 

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:45.870
 let's post something this is going to show in 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.990
 your news wall and so we will be 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:51.449
 always present in front of his eyes so much 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.220
 for google like for facebook there is another 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:55.940
 very powerful and relatively tool 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.500
 new that is retargeting remarketing 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.870
 is to identify the person who 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.789
 already went to your company's website but 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.099
 did not buy or did not perform the action that 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:06.930
 I intended then by 

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:09.240
 installation of a file called cookie 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.099
 you can identify it and when it's 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.250
 using internet looking at other content 

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:16.560
 show you your notices in this way is 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.930
 advertising someone who has ever 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.610
 he was interested in what you are offering and 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.379
 that makes it much more possible 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.840
 that by reminding them of our existence 

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:26.380
 come back and end up doing the action 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.930
 what interests you 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:31.450
 something very important to clarify is that 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:33.490
 doing online advertising you can do 

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:35.770
 that people come to your website and know 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:38.050
 what you offer you have to analyze well to 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.150
 where and how to publish and what are we going to 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:42.640
 show when the visitor arrives a 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.590
 very common mistake is to send the person 

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:47.170
 that clicks on the notice to the first 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.970
 page of your site and so the user will 

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:51.850
 loses between different options that 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:53.890
 they present you what you have to do is a 

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:55.750
 landing page that is going to show 

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:58.210
 according to the search performed for 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:00.490
 achieve better capture your attention and that 

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:02.470
 do what interests us but this topic 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:05.770
 of the landing or landing pages 

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:07.840
 pages we'll see in other videos and 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:10.060

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.790
 video in the second we will show you
