Welcome to another Sexy Funny Kicthen

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:11.449
I am Pedro and this is Lorenzo

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.827
And today we have for you, an amazing recipe

00:00:14.827 --> 00:00:16.827
A rainbow cake, step by step

00:00:16.827 --> 00:00:18.478
So you can also do it in your house!

00:00:18.478 --> 00:00:20.237
And in the end we will have

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.780
A M&amp;M's kind of magic

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.220
But first lets go to the ingredients!

00:00:29.316 --> 00:00:30.761
Lets go!

00:00:30.761 --> 00:00:32.174
To make the dough of the cake you will need

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.300
750 grams of powder sugar, 750 grams of self raising flour and 750 gram of unsalted butter

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.980
don't forget 9 eggs, vanilla extract and milk

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.580
We used 6 food coloring for this cake, but you can use 1, 2 or whatever you wish

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.080
But for each color you will need one recipient

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.120
and we used this 25 cm forms for the cakes

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.900
Its very simple, in first place we will need something like this...

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.507
a bowl, a vase, a tuperware... I don't know

00:00:53.507 --> 00:00:56.082
You will start to add 750 grams of room temperature butter

00:00:56.082 --> 00:00:58.082
unsalted!

00:00:58.082 --> 00:00:59.320
oh man!

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.640
than you will need to mix it with...

00:01:01.068 --> 00:01:03.068

00:01:05.546 --> 00:01:06.456

00:01:07.061 --> 00:01:09.061

00:01:09.061 --> 00:01:10.946
lets start to mix it!

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.070
attention, you will add your icing sugar to it step by step, after the butter is ready

00:01:16.316 --> 00:01:18.316
medium speed!

00:01:21.357 --> 00:01:24.457
when its more consistance you start to add the sugar

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.960
here goes the 750 grams of powder sugar

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.500
i am all dirty! stop!

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.480
lets keep doing our business

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.203
he got dirty...

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.240
keep "beating" it baby

00:01:55.393 --> 00:01:58.040
lets"beat" (in portugese also means stroke it) this one together!

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.740
9 eggs!

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.880
can you see how it looks over there at home?

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.880
"now"

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.389
now you add the 9 mixed eggs

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:19.329
and add them step by step

00:02:24.735 --> 00:02:26.735
you tiger!

00:02:26.735 --> 00:02:29.535
After you mix the eggs lets add the flour

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.800
add the 750 grams of flour and mix it for 5 minutes

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.180
in medium speed

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.040
and now add 2 table spoons of vanilla extract

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.040
and don't forget to preheat your oven to 180ยบ C

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.960
and its ALMOST!!!

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.740
Its ready!

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:42.240
6 soup plates

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.160
6 bowls, 6 whatever you want

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.015
now you will divide your cake dough by the six plates

00:02:47.015 --> 00:02:50.495
i think we did too much cake...

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.940
so now lets mix our colors

00:02:53.981 --> 00:02:55.981
we are so cute

00:02:55.981 --> 00:02:58.966
if you don't have colors, don't do it with colors, or do it with 2 or something

00:02:58.966 --> 00:03:00.966
just make a cake!

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.100
but this cake dough its TOP! (amazing)

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.580
Lets go

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.460
For a cake you should use gel color, but liquid its also ok

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.140
add your color till you have the color you want

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.140
and now we put a bit of butter in the microwave

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.420
and we greased our cake forms

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.420
and we also add a bit of flour

00:03:18.617 --> 00:03:20.617
now just add your colorfull cake dough

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:23.460
we only had 2 of this, so we did 2 cakes at a time

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.860
the cake must be 30 minutes on the oven at 180ยบC

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:32.149
So lets start

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.120
while our 6 layers of the cake are in the microwave

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.391
are in the oven...

00:03:38.391 --> 00:03:42.611
lets make our butter cream

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.246
its what we will use to cover our cake

00:03:46.246 --> 00:03:51.020
there are a lot of cake frosting but this one is a very good one and simple to do

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.636
you only will need 4 ingredients

00:03:52.636 --> 00:03:54.461
800g of icing sugar (powder)

00:03:54.461 --> 00:03:56.174
400 g of unsalted butter

00:03:56.174 --> 00:03:58.240
1 tablespoon of vanilla extract

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.669
and 5 tablespoons of milk

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:02.669
it should be all milk (fat)

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:05.355
number one, use the mixer in high speed

00:04:05.355 --> 00:04:07.355
all your butter

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:08.597
its done!

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.708
so now we will add first 400 grams of icing sugar, and when its mixed

00:04:12.708 --> 00:04:14.780
the remaining 400 grams of icing sugar

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.780
so start to mix it!

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.420
it should be something like this

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.980
also add the 5 tablespoons of fat Milk and 1 tablespoons of vanilla extract

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.980
lets build our cake

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.690
start to put a little bit of your butter cream in the base of your plate

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.690
and than you add layer by layer

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.410
between each layer you will add more butter cream

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.700
and just repeat it in every layer

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.547
in the end its the big layer! add a bit more than usual butter cream all around the cake

00:04:45.547 --> 00:04:49.584
start on the top, and than go to the side

00:04:49.584 --> 00:04:53.944
and now you should put it 15 minutes on the fridge

00:04:58.192 --> 00:05:01.013
when your cake is out of the fridge the butter cream will be harder!

00:05:01.013 --> 00:05:04.413
so now its easy to add the remaining butter cream and cover all the cake

00:05:04.413 --> 00:05:06.413
put it all over it, till it looks like this!

00:05:06.413 --> 00:05:08.338
and now the magic part

00:05:08.338 --> 00:05:09.576
its simple!

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.320
Or with a fat straw, or a little one, or even a big toothpick or something like that

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.920
put it in the middle of your cake till it goes half way of the cake

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:21.500
and now you need to melt chocolate, if you don't know how to melt it, just watch our "How to melt Chocolate video"

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.760
Yes, we need GLUE, so chocolate is the answer!

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.723
And know the M&amp;M's!!!

00:05:26.723 --> 00:05:29.543
put a bit of melted chocolate in each M&amp;M and stick it to the straw

00:05:29.543 --> 00:05:31.543
and you will make a waterfall effect like this

00:05:31.543 --> 00:05:34.283
like the M&amp;M package exploded into the cake

00:05:34.346 --> 00:05:41.272
For the M&amp;M's package look like its full, just add some newspaper or plastic or cotton, something fluffy and with no weight

00:05:41.272 --> 00:05:43.272
Now we wanted to make the waterfall effect on the cake so we made it to look like this.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.428
you can put it like this, or you can put it all around the cake, as you most desire

00:05:46.428 --> 00:05:52.968
and now its easy, just add some melted chocolate to the inside of the package and glue the straw to it also

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.117
oh man! oh man!

00:05:57.117 --> 00:05:59.720
our Rainbow Waterfall M&amp;M's cake, its READY!!!

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.119
ITS MAGIC!!!

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:04.000
the work this shit gave us, omg!

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.943

00:06:05.943 --> 00:06:07.943

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:13.060
