00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
the shower my hair was wet and then I

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.910 
the shower my hair was wet and then I
blow<00:01:27.420> dried<00:01:27.630> my<00:01:27.659> hair<00:01:27.930> with<00:01:28.470> like<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.680> hair

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
blow dried my hair with like a hair

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.179 
blow dried my hair with like a hair
dryer<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.640> basically<00:01:29.939> happen<00:01:30.509> was<00:01:30.890> my<00:01:31.890> hair

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
dryer and I basically happen was my hair

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.039 
dryer and I basically happen was my hair
it<00:01:32.400> just<00:01:32.430> took<00:01:32.670> forever<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.240> dry<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.689> literally

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
it just took forever to dry I literally

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.399 
it just took forever to dry I literally
spent<00:01:34.500> like<00:01:35.100> um<00:01:35.430> 20<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.509> 30<00:01:36.720> minutes<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.259> it

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
spent like um 20 to 30 minutes and it

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.990 
spent like um 20 to 30 minutes and it
usually<00:01:37.560> takes<00:01:37.860> me<00:01:37.950> like<00:01:38.130> 10<00:01:38.400> minutes<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.820> dry

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
usually takes me like 10 minutes to dry

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.030 
usually takes me like 10 minutes to dry
my<00:01:39.119> hair<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.540> what<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:40.079> does<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.799> actually

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
my hair and what this does it actually

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.330 
my hair and what this does it actually
slows<00:01:41.520> down<00:01:42.210> on<00:01:42.570> your<00:01:43.079> drying<00:01:43.409> process<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.250> I

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
slows down on your drying process and I

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.889 
slows down on your drying process and I
think<00:01:44.520> it's<00:01:44.640> because<00:01:44.759> it's<00:01:45.060> anti-frizz<00:01:45.780> serum

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
think it's because it's anti-frizz serum

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:53.830 
think it's because it's anti-frizz serum
so<00:01:46.649> yeah

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.230 

then<00:01:54.679> I<00:01:54.740> got<00:01:54.890> a<00:01:54.920> shampoo<00:01:55.340> and<00:01:55.549> it's<00:01:55.640> my<00:01:55.759> Pantene

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
then I got a shampoo and it's my Pantene

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.270 
then I got a shampoo and it's my Pantene
and<00:01:56.479> it's<00:01:57.109> basically<00:01:57.439> a<00:01:57.560> curly<00:01:58.130> to<00:01:58.250> straight

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
and it's basically a curly to straight

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.539 
and it's basically a curly to straight
um<00:01:58.960> shampoo<00:01:59.960> so<00:02:00.350> it<00:02:00.500> makes<00:02:00.649> your<00:02:00.829> hair<00:02:01.219> if<00:02:01.310> you

overnight or sometimes I leave it for an
hour<00:03:57.799> to<00:03:58.160> it<00:03:58.459> doesn't<00:03:58.669> really<00:03:58.760> matter<00:03:58.970> but<00:03:59.329> i

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
hour to it doesn't really matter but i

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.120 
hour to it doesn't really matter but i
would<00:03:59.870> definitely<00:04:00.079> warm<00:04:00.380> this<00:04:00.500> up<00:04:00.680> i<00:04:00.859> wouldn't

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
would definitely warm this up i wouldn't

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.039 
would definitely warm this up i wouldn't
use<00:04:01.220> a<00:04:01.250> try<00:04:01.549> plus<00:04:01.849> when<00:04:02.180> you<00:04:02.269> get<00:04:02.450> it<00:04:02.599> it's<00:04:02.870> not

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
use a try plus when you get it it's not

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.839 
use a try plus when you get it it's not
like<00:04:03.260> in<00:04:03.409> a<00:04:03.500> liquid<00:04:03.799> form<00:04:03.980> it's<00:04:04.489> more<00:04:04.700> of<00:04:04.819> like

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849 
like in a liquid form it's more of like

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:07.540 
like in a liquid form it's more of like
in<00:04:05.090> a<00:04:05.180> thick<00:04:05.480> pulp<00:04:06.019> so<00:04:06.709> it's<00:04:06.950> hard<00:04:07.129> to<00:04:07.159> get<00:04:07.310> out

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
in a thick pulp so it's hard to get out

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.070 
in a thick pulp so it's hard to get out
so<00:04:07.670> um<00:04:07.910> i<00:04:08.120> would<00:04:08.360> definitely<00:04:08.570> warm<00:04:08.810> this<00:04:08.900> up

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
so um i would definitely warm this up
