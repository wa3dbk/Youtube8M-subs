00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:08.309
 now son came to classes there 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.990
 developmental classes do not read and learn 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.690
 there are all sorts of logical puzzles small 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:19.920
 interesting and very much like him 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:24.260
 well and while I drive decided to write down new 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:30.960
 a video will help write it down a little 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:34.060
 wanted to talk about the importance of what 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.560
 children need to be taught that they 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:41.110
 listened to yourself 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:43.480
 what do i mean listen to your 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.280
 feelings listen to your 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.850
 sensations 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.680
 to my emotions that I feel that to me 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:56.370
 want to your desire 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:58.480
 to my needs what i need and then 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.400
 there is if a person knows how to himself 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.690
 heed he can clearly 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.149
 articulate 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.430
 Well, the wording is also something like that 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:08.290
 not only that we should have to listen 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.780
 then articulate it express 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.869
 voice and you then clearly understand what 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:19.229
 you want as you want why and so 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:21.340
 further if the person is able 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.530
 listen to your feelings he 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.160
 then clearly knows what he wants and this 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.350
 now in life is so very complicated 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.780
 the question is because often people in general 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.940
 don't know what they want it seemed to be 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.070
 would yes then there is a little baby up 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.530
 who learn to listen to themselves and 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.650
 what is the connection with the fact that he will grow up and 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:46.090
 he will be there for 30 years 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:48.220
 very big huge connection many 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.630
 adults now ask anyone again 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.700
 I'm telling you about my experiences 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.530
 personal growth trainings 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.650
 from my own experience like mine 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.140
 was anyone ask no one knows what 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.400
 he wants nobody can understand that is 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.170
 even if you sit there for half an hour 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.450
 discuss this topic to think anyway 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.459
 man will not really come to answer than 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.970
 he is true though what he really wants is 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.720
 it will be very difficult and if the child learn 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.370
 since childhood 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.989
 that is not a child before this person 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.410
 an adult who doesn't know now what he is 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:22.570
 wants he was also a child and in childhood 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.030
 he was simply not told did not explain 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:28.550
 and he sort of 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.730
 investigation grew up and he still has not 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.819
 knows what he wants and not only that 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.920
 need that is, in different situations of the child 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.810
 asking there what do you feel you need 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:43.000
 still provoke situations so he 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:46.040
 specifically thought that what he wants 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.780
 elementary are you going to walk you 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.770
 say what shirt you wear there 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.860
 striped 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.319
 or there with a machine drawn and he 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.739
 thinks and makes some choice that is 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:00.880
 you made him think a little bit when 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:03.260
 he was offended there upset crying you 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.959
 trying to find out from him that he 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.670
 Feels if he still does not understand 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.340
 know and you tell him to speak 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.470
 it's probably upset you now 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.630
 you feel that then you are upset 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:20.060
 so there or are you offended there 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:22.370
 angry that is trying to him in the moment 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.750
 teach him you mean teach him 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.420
 that he is, that you yourself must understand 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:31.519
 what the child could feel now and 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:33.440
 you tell him that and the child then 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.000
 it gets easier the next time u 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.489
 it will happen exactly the same situation 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.060
 he will remember that you told him that it 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:44.269
 I am angry and he will now say that I am not 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.340
 angry and why are you angry at what you 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.230
 angry that is why you started 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.829
 angry that upset you that was not 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.220
 so what you wanted and she didn't happen too 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:58.250
 what happened that is 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.850
 twist twist it to make it seem 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.650
 would 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:06.049
 that is, it is very difficult to small 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.900
 child why does he need this here 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:11.120
 everything is necessary he is not small he is big 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.650
 small children after three years even 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.049
 already earlier they are already very much 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.410
 the uptake is very much understand and very 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:20.959
 it is important to tell him how to eat that is 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.490
 immediately the very beginning sometimes adults themselves 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.930
 can't figure out what they are 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.520
 feel and can not understand what 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:30.050
 a situation occurs and they are not 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.850
 can answer him yes that is, they kind of 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.710
 do not pay attention to the downturn then nonsense 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:37.560
 there is some sort of delirium, some 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.480
 no nonsense it's all very important and if 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.250
 the child since the childhood begins here such 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.380
 moments to understand and feel that he 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.840
 mad that he wants I would like there 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.970
 banana is not an orange comparing bananas to me 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:53.780
 I like comparing more I know 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:56.610
 a great example has also been quite recently 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.860
 machine and here it is by the way yes small 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.480
 This machine was in my machine 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.310
 I was playing during my childhood 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.050
 it was my favorite machine but me 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.790
 I liked it very much and asks my son 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.220
 dad why was your favorite 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.920
 machine but I tell him that I am very 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.930
 liked her shape how she looked 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.880
 that she is silver I had 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.920
 such wheels fast she is very fast 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.580
 Well, it went like this sports 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:22.680
 car and he says 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.560
 I like lamborghini now 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.800
 yeah i like lamborghini now 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.800
 lamborghini and 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.469
 before you answer 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:37.780
 that is, I thought for a few seconds 

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:41.120
 and then gave him the next answer I grew up 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:43.939
 saw that there are other cars compared 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:48.110
 and realized that now lamborghini is better 

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:52.210
 everything for me just for me and he 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:55.669
 I remembered that I could let him know that 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.919
 not just so that's why I am here this 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:00.110
 like the car and I explained to them what was 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:02.629
 comparison I saw other different cars 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.039
 there but something there learned something there learned 

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:06.080
 and understood by comparison 

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:07.849
 and from experience that this is what I have now 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.250
 I like the most and I would like to 

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:12.650
 there is such a car and he is 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:15.379
 remembered and then there were moments when he 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.270
 firstly I repeated it myself several times 

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:19.550
 this very dad I remember you to me 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.650
 told you liked this machine 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.789
 Then I started to like this car because 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:27.770
 that you grew up I realized that there is something else 

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:31.249
 compared and concluded that this is for you 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:33.110
 better learned so to speak for myself here 

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:35.509
 that is a very small moment 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:38.629
 the child does it all the time it is 

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:40.639
 times hard work first for 

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:41.330
 you hard work you need to explain 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:44.569
 to kid 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:46.219
 because every time you do this thing 

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:48.349
 need to explain you need to work with 

00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:50.899
 a child here is this education here 

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:52.969
 these are these very well nurture 

00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:54.740
 important little moments from what later 

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:57.199
 man grows up he becomes 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:59.930
 the person become that is something 

00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:05.240
 one person confident calm and all u 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:07.069
 he was well I hope the video was clear 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.599
 if you have any questions then 

00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:10.490
 there are still likely to be others 

00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:12.440
 videos returning to the same 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:15.199
 topics will be there as you different sides 

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:18.169
 talk but I hope that is there was 

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:20.030
 everything is clear if you have any questions 

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:22.099
 there leave in the comments I'm there on them 

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:25.490
 I will answer or there I will write down some more 

00:07:22.099 --> 00:07:27.949
 video on the same topic is about the importance of what 

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:32.979
 listen to yourself need to be able to and this 

00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:32.979
 very important thank you all for
