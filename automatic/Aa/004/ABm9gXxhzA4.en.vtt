box now let me go ahead and get it out

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.300 
box now let me go ahead and get it out
of<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.329> box<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:58.860> course<00:00:59.070> we're<00:00:59.160> going<00:00:59.250> to

00:00:59.300 --> 00:00:59.310 
of the box and of course we're going to

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.830 
of the box and of course we're going to
fast<00:00:59.520> forward<00:00:59.700> this<00:00:59.820> part<00:00:59.910> but<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.690> should

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840

so once you get this box out you got to

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.210 
so once you get this box out you got to
deal<00:01:03.930> with<00:01:04.080> this<00:01:04.470> box<00:01:04.680> right<00:01:04.830> here<00:01:05.009> and

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220

two pieces of his tail that connect to
each<00:01:26.300> other<00:01:26.390> is<00:01:26.600> pretty<00:01:26.750> easy<00:01:26.900> to<00:01:27.080> assemble

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
each other is pretty easy to assemble

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.530 
each other is pretty easy to assemble

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
the box now let's get a good look at

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.580 
the box now let's get a good look at
them<00:01:31.369> from<00:01:31.460> all<00:01:31.729> sides<00:01:32.030> so<00:01:32.720> here<00:01:33.080> is<00:01:33.200> the<00:01:33.410> front

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590

articulation<00:01:53.940> goes<00:01:54.120> its<00:01:54.360> mouth<00:01:54.540> moves<00:01:54.810> up<00:01:54.990> and

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
articulation goes its mouth moves up and

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.130 
articulation goes its mouth moves up and
down

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:07.740 

his<00:02:01.140> neck<00:02:01.440> turns<00:02:01.710> completely<00:02:02.250> around

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.880 

the<00:02:08.750> arms<00:02:09.080> go<00:02:09.259> up<00:02:09.440> and<00:02:09.649> down

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.700 

both<00:02:14.460> wrists<00:02:14.940> turns<00:02:15.180> completely<00:02:15.690> around<00:02:18.710> both

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
both wrists turns completely around both

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.979 
both wrists turns completely around both
legs<00:02:20.100> go<00:02:20.400> back<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:20.880> forth

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.009 

both<00:02:24.560> feet<00:02:24.890> time<00:02:25.189> completely<00:02:25.579> around<00:02:27.609> and

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
both feet time completely around and

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.509 
both feet time completely around and
there<00:02:30.019> is<00:02:30.109> a<00:02:30.140> total<00:02:30.500> of<00:02:30.620> three<00:02:30.890> sections<00:02:31.400> of

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
there is a total of three sections of

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.610 
there is a total of three sections of
his<00:02:31.579> tail<00:02:31.849> that<00:02:31.969> actually<00:02:32.299> move<00:02:32.480> around<00:02:32.780> one

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
his tail that actually move around one

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.990 
his tail that actually move around one
section<00:02:33.950> moves<00:02:34.129> back<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.489> forth<00:02:34.730> and<00:02:34.879> the

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
section moves back and forth and the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.309 
section moves back and forth and the
other<00:02:35.120> two<00:02:35.299> sections<00:02:35.480> just<00:02:35.780> turn<00:02:36.079> completely

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
other two sections just turn completely

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:43.690 
other two sections just turn completely
around<00:02:41.709> so<00:02:42.709> as<00:02:42.799> you<00:02:42.889> can<00:02:42.980> see<00:02:43.040> he<00:02:43.219> has<00:02:43.340> lots<00:02:43.579> of

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
around so as you can see he has lots of

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.369 
around so as you can see he has lots of
articulation<00:02:44.389> and<00:02:44.569> I<00:02:44.810> should<00:02:44.989> mention<00:02:45.109> on<00:02:45.319> the

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:45.379 
articulation and I should mention on the

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:47.199 
articulation and I should mention on the

toy<00:03:17.540> is<00:03:17.719> that<00:03:17.900> it<00:03:18.139> does<00:03:18.319> not<00:03:18.500> make<00:03:18.799> any<00:03:19.040> sounds

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
toy is that it does not make any sounds
