00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:01.990 
flying legged yeah I was hoping to use

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.560 
flying legged yeah I was hoping to use
this<00:01:02.320> as<00:01:02.620> an<00:01:02.770> element<00:01:03.310> to<00:01:03.460> wipe<00:01:03.760> from<00:01:04.449> the

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
this as an element to wipe from the

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.950 
this as an element to wipe from the
trash

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
trash

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.789 
trash
jump<00:01:05.620> to<00:01:06.340> the<00:01:06.460> transition<00:01:06.880> of<00:01:07.240> the<00:01:07.590> Gulf<00:01:08.590> of

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799 
jump to the transition of the Gulf of

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.450 
jump to the transition of the Gulf of
the<00:01:09.400> drone<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.840> instead<00:01:11.619> of<00:01:11.680> looking<00:01:12.040> straight

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
the drone so instead of looking straight

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.840 
the drone so instead of looking straight
out<00:01:12.490> he<00:01:13.240> actually<00:01:13.780> looks<00:01:14.170> down<00:01:14.530> like<00:01:15.220> that

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
out he actually looks down like that

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.420 
out he actually looks down like that
and<00:01:16.119> so<00:01:16.300> you<00:01:16.360> can<00:01:16.510> use<00:01:16.690> this<00:01:17.020> to<00:01:17.860> mask<00:01:18.100> the

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
and so you can use this to mask the

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.340 
and so you can use this to mask the
transition<00:01:19.030> figure<00:01:19.450> he<00:01:19.570> would<00:01:19.720> be<00:01:19.810> looking<00:01:20.200> to

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
transition figure he would be looking to

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.050 
transition figure he would be looking to
where<00:01:20.500> he<00:01:20.680> actual<00:01:21.040> actually<00:01:21.430> had<00:01:21.580> to<00:01:21.700> anchor

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
where he actual actually had to anchor

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.840 
where he actual actually had to anchor
well<00:01:22.869> oh<00:01:23.220> yeah<00:01:24.220> that'll<00:01:24.670> work

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
well oh yeah that'll work

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.270 
well oh yeah that'll work
