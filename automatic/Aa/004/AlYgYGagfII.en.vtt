00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 here we are with the tenth episode divided with 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.220
 sprinting suffering this time not 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.139
 age an boot with an argument 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.940
 I thought of how you understand slabs 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.250
 we organize no we don't organize ourselves 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.929
 we are just as it happens then not 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.410
 I knew they didn't even say we need to talk 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.810
 today today you remember what you need 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.850
 talk about how to make a comment 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.470
 exactly so many people ask me so I have 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.900
 thought to make a spire bet 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.580
 console of this note so that 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.080
 we'll talk for a moment and how many better 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.630
 acquisition cards to record 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.250
 xbox 360 thinks about a 3 or maybe then 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.899
 also to go on you tube name and then 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.899
 everything microphones exactly 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.570
 then if you are up of course if you want 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:49.550
 start falun as talia first 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.710
 of servers register the game yes 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.180
 meanwhile you have to have a console at a PC 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.949
 here are the six on PC that is not there 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.260
 no problem because on the PCs of 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:01.640
 programs like the software directory 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.110
 team the small for mac allow to 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.330
 record the game without having any 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.789
 to be presences on English consul 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.869
 the different situation uses the 

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:10.580
 cards at the beginning are also 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.770
 quite expensive however today will try to 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.180
 guide and to understand what is the 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.100
 better, however, the one with the best 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.649
 open relationship the first of which 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.220
 let's talk about is the fin product team 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:23.360
 two races are the dyson who end with lo 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.940
 studio movie box hd 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.159
 then the second we named is 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.890
 around 100 euros while the nets and the 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.140
 you can get 50 years so it's a lot 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.060
 however accessible must be said 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.860
 that the quality is very poor exact 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.530
 give a video in four texts e 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.600
 just pretend to understand anyway 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.429
 person intends to streamline but if he sees it 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.009
 several gofar comments had a lei 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:48.080
 the quality and the square ones in essence 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:51.110
 with very low quality but the same 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.849
 according to me to start to try to 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.310
 wine make a big expense too and can 

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:56.810
 also fit in the end now we do 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.759
 a small other qualitative leap 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.349
 let's go to that device that ad 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.890
 example use of medium quality 

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:06.649
 In short 9 Average high even that 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.739
 exactly the one of the hd pvr hd 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.750
 more wars and limiting media 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.640
 together for the simple fact that they know 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.959
 both the exact component then 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.120
 those five cables are your own 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.950
 great not the academia either for 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.209
 the entrance that for the exit of the 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.160
 feat video information 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.830
 then the piece that less is more or less the 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.659
 same for about 150 Euros for both 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.340
 an average between institutions is good for 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:30.140
 of course they are you have to look at 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.120
 different offers though if you like 150 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.379
 euro be brought home 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.360
 nevertheless for different media 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:37.580
 benefits that push you to buy with 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.519
 at least in my opinion it has a psychosis but 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.420
 usb stick to stick to 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.909
 device 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.709
 and so you don't necessarily need to connect it 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:47.060
 on the computer you can record on 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.400
 echo key on an external hard drive 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.810
 can register directly there without the 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.489
 problem to connect every time must 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.280
 be a computer perhaps of deaf people 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.670
 you're miles away from your computer 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.720
 and besides also a convinced e 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.340
 performance that allows you to 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.830
 record in this way as the 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.870
 old computer given another jump of 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.900
 we have quality with legato game fair 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:11.319
 full hd and with the hd pvr 2 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.670
 yes because there is also 21 have one 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.380
 quality without all the major are i 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.819
 giants so far is quality 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.920
 the best are from 180 to 200 euros e 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.569
 they have many advantages especially the 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.620
 most interesting thing that will be possible 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.500
 record comments using 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.910
 only the academy leads the five spins 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.739
 off of an ice cream is not recourse must 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.930
 use those tasks that are around are 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.269
 really things randomly 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.950
 they are gigantic and therefore with revenues 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.140
 you can record the perfectly below 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.590
 four subtle power plants a quality 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.720
 best 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.120
 that's how features like quality 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.190
 on which minors both products what 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.140
 I advise instead attached because of 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.580
 cat is a little more exactly the second 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.350
 it is more practical really tiny is 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.819
 present billions take away from it 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.260
 or less than the big one usually 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.870
 much smaller than a box of a 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.550
 Game between half more or less according pd 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.049
 me is the best one is the best 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.090
 possibility for the moment then 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:03.370
 naturally it has been so many years that 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.470
 I'm sure all the computer pros 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.519
 some laces will be then this tremble 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.989
 talk about the card here 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.329
 ok we also talk about the election of 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.010
 dedication to enlarge maybe no one 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.570
 is asked this way there are some 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.310
 Acquisition boards which then attack 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.440
 directly into the tower on his pc 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.489
 fixed then of sony computer and ti 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.919
 allow you to record directly 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.630
 by connecting the playstation3 xbox nick 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:24.910
 craw of something a little more 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.270
 expensive little more for experts so if 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.270
 then 

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:33.759
 the trial boys among not a nice gift a 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:39.199
 all fans of the series of things 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:40.370
 spreads the trier boys among them 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:41.990
 they had a nice idea for everyone 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.460
 how many elite cod fans will be 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.279
 completely free rape itself 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.080
 frey maybe santa and pc unfortunately won't be 

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:49.580
 available for wii u however however the 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.409
 made that much free 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.969
 probably in c among many people ad 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:54.800
 use it precisely because it is 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:56.449
 a very interesting thing in the end you 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.400
 provides all the maps you can 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.210
 get you your concrete class strategies 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.759
 etc 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.169
 and for the first time since mv trek was 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:04.610
 the first game with starts will be there 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:06.889
 also the statistics of the mode 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.750
 zombie users from a few days 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:10.759
 playstation plus and all users 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:17.300
 Americans who own life squares 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:18.860
 they can play at the top of a few 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.900
 days all playstation plus users 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.909
 and all the American owners of 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.900
 playstation life can play at 

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:25.849
 beta of playstation 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.289
 in addition to slam it ial while the effect 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:29.060
 you don't want to pay anything you don't want to have 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:30.979
 playstation plus I should wait only 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.169
 a few days and I could play with it 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:35.120
 normally up to where it will take blue 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:36.830
 gamepad if you've done this yourself 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.870
 perfect idiot question you think 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.189
 It was a bull gold is also empty the 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.500
 president of nintendo to give himself a 

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:44.270
 time idiot perfectly response 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.969
 in fact the same revolt has indeed responded 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.009
 that will depend on the size of yours 

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:50.539
 room and yours of his house in 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:53.270
 general way and above all from 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:56.210
 materials with which it is built therefore 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:58.360
 if you have a diamond house I think that 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.360
 we 

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:06.080
 the question of the ticino purchase of the 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.460
 last time it was what you would have done yes 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.040
 that what happened happened 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.870
 to the guy in the clip where the girl 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.250
 the splits crossed exactly who it was 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.810
 we give this time we have only one 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.320
 comment I think it's the best in 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.760
 absolute 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:25.250
 it was written if we have it here in i 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:27.230
 computer xxx true vip lawler gamer is there 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.940
 written to have done exor with the 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.410
 control and beautiful comment if not 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.880
 was from prof comet prof 

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.770
 unfortunately he didn't have many votes 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.810
 let's go to that question today then 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:38.300
 let's go with today's close question 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:40.190
 so it should be fished this time not 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.830
 I want to do everything since then I have not 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.150
 listen let's do it well eh well it takes 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.200
 well until the early case a ticket 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:50.120
 house offers to take it exactly 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.790
 he will never learn the crisis, but why 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:55.610
 he asks too well then here 

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:55.880
 rezzato who disappointed you the most until 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.340
 Now 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.810
 ok then ciancimino in a comment 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.420
 what is the ugliest game just the 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.890
 more disgusting brute than the ugly brute 

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:06.830
 of the shy just for club 

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:09.650
 because of course it's a little bit 

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:11.390
 what do you have in me what do you think i 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.310
 best comments the most original and 

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:15.440
 nice will be read in the class 

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.490
 putative of the final balance nothing there 

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.820
 let 's see the next date 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.820
 Hello
