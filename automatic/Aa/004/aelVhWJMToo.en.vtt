00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:14.019
 dolf coverage has been a professional instructor for higher for over twenty years 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:14.999
 skill 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:19.369
 in the series a riders our members is meant to give them advice on how to improve 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.880
 driving skills on public roads 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.259
 often I heard people say that we also speed the ball for example 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:27.599
 on German autobahn 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.679
 not very interesting 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:33.750
 nevertheless I often see during training that participants best rock tips and tricks 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.010
 can use 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.940
 to make driving at high speed safer, not only safer 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.340
 but also more relaxed 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.530
 but what I do regularly see is that participants 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.499
 lies under the influence of a little adrenaline 

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:50.329
 or higher speed 250 plus convulsively get behind the wheel 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.030
 well because we look at what exactly happens under his car on high 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.030
 speed 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.129
 at least what is beautiful is that 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.410
 be aware that the tire is a very flexible entity 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.530
 what the young rider is to me 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.920
 but then just send the fact that the command 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.260
 to lose life just before closure 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.760
 So that means if you don't 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.930
 send your money crafts and what a nice salary will be that is one 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.930
 a quarter of the youth tread of the tires follow quickly 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.220
 He can let's go and see how it makes the car look like 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.220
 see 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.620
 the rangers out a bit 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.200
 record ahead 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.200
 It is important that we give wilders the role of bass 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.500
 it was getting older 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.460
 and certainly not perceptible 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.550
 the car that just has to be able to find its way 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.370
 after this piece of music a short time after he did the bolder protein south 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.720
 must also be reachable 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.210
 we stick to it 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.340
 one after the other 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.930
 then it will be assumed that 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.800
 no another will catch up 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.360
 minus to look through pink glasses and assume that they are behind 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.610
 will stick together 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.489
 Whatever a gain in speed you naturally have Nijmegen 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.620
 show the fault from left and right on photo and too fast speed 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.639
 download 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:24.389
 but we will also go in once but you buy it 

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:27.399
 nice and loosely on the hands but there is a lot of pedal pressure 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.889
 but I'm late for the cost again 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:33.889
 but we have 

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:37.629
 in the next episode, dow talks about cornering technology
