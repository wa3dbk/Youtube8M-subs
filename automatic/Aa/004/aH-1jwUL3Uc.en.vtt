so<00:00:18.359> today<00:00:18.570> we're<00:00:18.660> going<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.840> be<00:00:18.900> building<00:00:19.080> a

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
so today we're going to be building a

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.900 
so today we're going to be building a
vacuum<00:00:19.800> cannon<00:00:20.279> that<00:00:20.609> will<00:00:20.699> shoot<00:00:20.850> a

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
vacuum cannon that will shoot a

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.370 
vacuum cannon that will shoot a
ping-pong<00:00:21.119> ball<00:00:21.300> at<00:00:21.630> 300<00:00:22.050> miles<00:00:22.140> an<00:00:22.289> hour

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
ping-pong ball at 300 miles an hour

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.830 
ping-pong ball at 300 miles an hour
using<00:00:22.680> nothing<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.310> vacuum<00:00:23.880> now<00:00:24.269> finally<00:00:24.689> using

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
using nothing a vacuum now finally using

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.679 
using nothing a vacuum now finally using
my<00:00:24.990> new<00:00:25.140> vacuum<00:00:25.529> pump<00:00:26.240> the<00:00:27.240> only<00:00:27.420> thing<00:00:27.599> we

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
my new vacuum pump the only thing we

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.660 
my new vacuum pump the only thing we
really<00:00:27.900> have<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.109> do<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.470> we<00:00:29.070> have<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.369> drill<00:00:29.640> a

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
really have to do is we have to drill a

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.400 
really have to do is we have to drill a
hole<00:00:29.760> into<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.269> PVC<00:00:30.630> pipe<00:00:30.779> so<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.050> can<00:00:31.170> put<00:00:31.260> this

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
hole into the PVC pipe so I can put this

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.110 
hole into the PVC pipe so I can put this
fitting<00:00:31.679> on<00:00:31.800> there<00:00:31.980> so<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.369> can<00:00:32.550> connect<00:00:32.850> this

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
fitting on there so I can connect this

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.740 
fitting on there so I can connect this
fitting<00:00:33.630> via<00:00:34.350> my<00:00:34.530> vinyl<00:00:35.399> tubing<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.450> my<00:00:36.570> vacuum

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
fitting via my vinyl tubing to my vacuum

pump<00:00:37.170> now<00:00:38.010> how<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:38.309> starts<00:00:38.550> your<00:00:38.640> going<00:00:38.760> to

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
pump now how this starts your going to

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.150 
pump now how this starts your going to
work<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.210> I'll<00:00:39.510> take<00:00:39.690> some<00:00:39.960> tape<00:00:40.230> or<00:00:40.710> some

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
work is I'll take some tape or some

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.520 
work is I'll take some tape or some
plastic<00:00:41.520> something<00:00:41.790> put<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.030> over<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.270> end

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
plastic something put it over the end

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.750 
plastic something put it over the end
something<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.770> barely<00:00:44.250> strong<00:00:44.610> enough

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
something that is barely strong enough

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.569 
something that is barely strong enough
to<00:00:44.879> hold<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.059> vacuum<00:00:45.800> I'll<00:00:46.800> put<00:00:46.980> this<00:00:47.100> over<00:00:47.250> just

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
to hold a vacuum I'll put this over just

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.660 
to hold a vacuum I'll put this over just
to<00:00:47.670> make<00:00:47.820> sure<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.059> stays<00:00:48.360> on<00:00:48.390> there<00:00:48.570> snugly

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
to make sure it stays on there snugly

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.080 
to make sure it stays on there snugly
now<00:00:50.670> put<00:00:50.879> another<00:00:51.059> one<00:00:51.210> on<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.360> other<00:00:51.390> end<00:00:53.090> so

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
now put another one on the other end so

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.049 
now put another one on the other end so
now<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.329> will<00:00:54.449> be<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.570> sealed<00:00:54.840> container<00:00:56.059> I'll

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
now this will be a sealed container I'll

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.279 
now this will be a sealed container I'll
put<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.300> ping-pong<00:00:57.510> wheel<00:00:57.780> inside<00:00:58.050> here

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
put the ping-pong wheel inside here

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.790 
put the ping-pong wheel inside here
about<00:00:58.469> right<00:00:58.590> here<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:59.780> then<00:01:00.780> whenever<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.530> pump

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
about right here so then whenever I pump

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.810 
about right here so then whenever I pump
the<00:01:01.920> air<00:01:01.949> out<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.340> with<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.640> ping-pong

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
the air out of it with the ping-pong

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.859 
the air out of it with the ping-pong
ball<00:01:03.149> inside<00:01:04.400> the<00:01:05.400> thin<00:01:06.090> material<00:01:06.570> put<00:01:06.689> over

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
ball inside the thin material put over

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.330 
ball inside the thin material put over
here<00:01:06.960> like<00:01:07.049> tape<00:01:07.320> or<00:01:07.530> plastic<00:01:07.950> or<00:01:08.100> aluminum

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
here like tape or plastic or aluminum

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.050 
here like tape or plastic or aluminum
foil

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
foil

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.969 
foil
well<00:01:09.540> bow<00:01:09.720> in<00:01:09.990> it'll<00:01:10.260> have<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.439> lot<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.680> pressure

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
well bow in it'll have a lot of pressure

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.649 
well bow in it'll have a lot of pressure
pushing<00:01:11.369> against<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.880> same<00:01:12.299> with<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.540> other

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
pushing against it same with the other

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.899 
pushing against it same with the other
side<00:01:12.830> I'll<00:01:13.830> take<00:01:14.189> like<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.400> needle<00:01:14.790> or

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
side I'll take like a needle or

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.300 
side I'll take like a needle or
something<00:01:15.210> or<00:01:15.360> produce<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.960> nail<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.380> pump

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
something or produce a nail and pump

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.749 
something or produce a nail and pump
that<00:01:18.170> aluminum<00:01:19.170> foil<00:01:19.439> or<00:01:19.590> plastic<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.250> now

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
that aluminum foil or plastic and now

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.300 
that aluminum foil or plastic and now
you<00:01:20.820> have<00:01:21.119> 14<00:01:21.659> psi<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.170> pressure<00:01:22.530> pushing

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
you have 14 psi of pressure pushing

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.859 
you have 14 psi of pressure pushing
through<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.970> two<00:01:24.119> because<00:01:24.360> there's<00:01:24.509> no<00:01:24.659> air

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
through the two because there's no air

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.080 
through the two because there's no air
inside<00:01:25.140> there<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:26.310> atmospheric<00:01:26.820> pressure

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
inside there that atmospheric pressure

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.420 
inside there that atmospheric pressure
push<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.960> quickly<00:01:28.710> accelerates<00:01:29.280> this

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
push it quickly accelerates this

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.640 
push it quickly accelerates this
ping-pong<00:01:29.670> ball<00:01:30.060> down<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.720> tube<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.170> there's

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
ping-pong ball down the tube and there's

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.469 
ping-pong ball down the tube and there's
no<00:01:31.799> air<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.070> front<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.880> stop<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:33.390> it

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
no air in front of it to stop it so it

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.390 
no air in front of it to stop it so it
just<00:01:33.600> keeps<00:01:33.780> accelerating<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.890> keeps<00:01:35.189> going

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
just keeps accelerating it keeps going

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.710 
just keeps accelerating it keeps going
down<00:01:35.670> until<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.329> breaks

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
down until it breaks

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.240 
down until it breaks
Andrew<00:01:36.990> bursts<00:01:37.380> through<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.680> other<00:01:37.950> end

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
Andrew bursts through the other end

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.760 
Andrew bursts through the other end
because<00:01:39.000> this<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.240> very<00:01:39.390> fragile<00:01:39.689> too<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.229> it

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
because this is very fragile too and it

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.440 
because this is very fragile too and it
just<00:01:40.890> keeps<00:01:41.100> going<00:01:41.369> at<00:01:41.460> 300<00:01:41.850> miles<00:01:41.970> an<00:01:42.119> hour<00:01:42.210> or

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
just keeps going at 300 miles an hour or

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.410 
just keeps going at 300 miles an hour or
faster<00:01:43.070> so<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.220> say<00:01:44.520> it's<00:01:44.700> this<00:01:44.850> is<00:01:45.030> gonna<00:01:45.299> be

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
faster so I say it's this is gonna be

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.120 
faster so I say it's this is gonna be
Roy's<00:01:45.659> simple<00:01:45.899> build<00:01:46.079> hopefully<00:01:46.259> let's<00:01:46.950> get

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
Roy's simple build hopefully let's get

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:58.640 
Roy's simple build hopefully let's get
going

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.750 

I'm<00:01:59.650> pretty<00:01:59.860> happy<00:02:00.070> with<00:02:00.250> that<00:02:00.310> that<00:02:00.610> turned

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
I'm pretty happy with that that turned

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.520 
I'm pretty happy with that that turned
out<00:02:00.850> pretty<00:02:00.880> nice<00:02:01.210> and<00:02:01.540> I<00:02:01.990> screwed<00:02:02.260> that<00:02:02.380> down

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
out pretty nice and I screwed that down

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.050 
out pretty nice and I screwed that down
pretty<00:02:02.620> far<00:02:02.950> so<00:02:03.130> to<00:02:03.190> act<00:02:03.370> as<00:02:03.490> a<00:02:03.580> stopper<00:02:03.940> for

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
pretty far so to act as a stopper for

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.850 
pretty far so to act as a stopper for
the<00:02:04.150> ping<00:02:04.330> pong<00:02:04.360> ball<00:02:04.510> that<00:02:05.440> way<00:02:05.590> I<00:02:05.620> can<00:02:05.830> put

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
the ping pong ball that way I can put

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.740 
the ping pong ball that way I can put
the<00:02:06.070> ping<00:02:06.220> pong<00:02:06.250> ball<00:02:06.580> in<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.790> very<00:02:06.970> end<00:02:07.240> I<00:02:07.450> can

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
the ping pong ball in the very end I can

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:08.910 
the ping pong ball in the very end I can
turn<00:02:07.900> on<00:02:08.020> the<00:02:08.110> vacuum<00:02:08.259> pump<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.740> ping<00:02:08.890> pong

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
turn on the vacuum pump the ping pong

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.010 
turn on the vacuum pump the ping pong
ball<00:02:09.100> will<00:02:09.340> be<00:02:09.399> sucked<00:02:09.700> back<00:02:09.820> here<00:02:10.240> and<00:02:10.390> it

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
ball will be sucked back here and it

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.460 
ball will be sucked back here and it
will<00:02:11.140> stop<00:02:11.500> right<00:02:12.280> in<00:02:12.370> front<00:02:12.490> of<00:02:12.580> here<00:02:13.440> now<00:02:14.440> I

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
will stop right in front of here now I

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
will stop right in front of here now I
just<00:02:14.560> need<00:02:14.800> to<00:02:14.860> hook<00:02:15.070> it<00:02:15.190> all<00:02:15.250> up

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
just need to hook it all up

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.280 
just need to hook it all up
once<00:02:16.420> you're<00:02:16.570> like<00:02:16.660> five<00:02:16.840> minutes<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.200> make

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
once you're like five minutes to make

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:29.510 
once you're like five minutes to make
this<00:02:17.440> whole<00:02:17.590> thing

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.000 

so<00:02:30.420> first<00:02:30.630> off<00:02:30.810> I'll<00:02:30.930> try<00:02:31.080> some<00:02:31.260> aluminum<00:02:31.710> foil

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
so first off I'll try some aluminum foil

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
so first off I'll try some aluminum foil
over<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.280> ends

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.069 

well<00:02:53.030> load<00:02:53.209> the<00:02:53.239> ping-pong<00:02:53.659> ball<00:02:53.840> inside

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
well load the ping-pong ball inside

00:02:54.079 --> 00:03:14.910 
well load the ping-pong ball inside
there<00:02:54.319> by<00:02:54.470> putting<00:02:55.099> it<00:02:55.280> here

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.010 

now<00:03:15.920> let's<00:03:16.130> try<00:03:16.220> two<00:03:16.670> layers<00:03:17.420> of<00:03:17.510> Elementium

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
now let's try two layers of Elementium

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:29.179 
now let's try two layers of Elementium
foil<00:03:18.290> that<00:03:19.070> will<00:03:19.160> help<00:03:19.220> to<00:03:19.340> make<00:03:19.370> you<00:03:19.520> stronger

00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:29.189 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:31.259 

so<00:03:30.189> I<00:03:30.219> decided<00:03:30.489> for<00:03:30.670> this<00:03:30.790> run<00:03:30.969> that<00:03:31.090> I'll<00:03:31.180> be

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
so I decided for this run that I'll be

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:32.729 
so I decided for this run that I'll be
putting<00:03:31.390> one<00:03:31.840> layer<00:03:32.079> in<00:03:32.170> the<00:03:32.260> back<00:03:32.409> that<00:03:32.650> way

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
putting one layer in the back that way

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.110 
putting one layer in the back that way
that<00:03:32.920> will<00:03:33.069> always<00:03:33.219> break<00:03:33.489> before<00:03:33.640> the<00:03:33.909> front

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
that will always break before the front

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.459 
that will always break before the front
one<00:03:34.269> because<00:03:34.750> it<00:03:34.870> put<00:03:34.959> two<00:03:35.079> layers<00:03:35.260> in<00:03:35.379> the

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:35.469 
one because it put two layers in the

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:37.559 
one because it put two layers in the
front<00:03:35.650> one<00:03:35.769> that<00:03:36.609> way<00:03:36.790> the<00:03:37.180> front<00:03:37.299> will<00:03:37.480> be

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
front one that way the front will be

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:38.940 
front one that way the front will be
stronger<00:03:37.959> so<00:03:38.109> the<00:03:38.379> back<00:03:38.500> one<00:03:38.650> will<00:03:38.739> break

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
stronger so the back one will break

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.589 
stronger so the back one will break
pushing<00:03:39.519> in<00:03:39.579> the<00:03:39.640> right<00:03:39.760> direction<00:03:39.879> otherwise

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 
pushing in the right direction otherwise

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.240 
pushing in the right direction otherwise
I've<00:03:41.109> had<00:03:41.290> several<00:03:41.500> instances<00:03:41.709> where<00:03:41.980> it'll

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
I've had several instances where it'll

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.949 
I've had several instances where it'll
go<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.700> wrong<00:03:42.849> way<00:03:43.060> because<00:03:43.209> the<00:03:43.420> front<00:03:43.930> a

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
go the wrong way because the front a

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.059 
go the wrong way because the front a
little<00:03:44.109> break<00:03:44.230> before<00:03:44.379> the<00:03:44.500> back<00:03:44.709> one<00:03:44.890> and

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
little break before the back one and

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:46.949 
little break before the back one and
then<00:03:45.549> it<00:03:45.640> just<00:03:45.790> eats<00:03:46.060> up<00:03:46.239> the<00:03:46.450> ping-pong<00:03:46.629> ball

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
then it just eats up the ping-pong ball

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:53.490 
then it just eats up the ping-pong ball
in<00:03:47.109> the<00:03:47.500> back<00:03:51.930> it's<00:03:52.930> occurred<00:03:53.170> to<00:03:53.200> me<00:03:53.349> that<00:03:53.470> I

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
in the back it's occurred to me that I

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.979 
in the back it's occurred to me that I
don't<00:03:53.560> have<00:03:53.769> to<00:03:53.829> have<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.099> exact<00:03:54.459> same

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
don't have to have the exact same

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.330 
don't have to have the exact same
material<00:03:55.989> on<00:03:56.139> both<00:03:56.469> ends<00:03:56.859> because<00:03:56.980> I<00:03:57.189> know<00:03:57.250> a

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
material on both ends because I know a

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.399 
material on both ends because I know a
limonium<00:03:57.760> oil<00:03:58.120> does<00:03:58.329> break<00:03:58.659> but<00:03:59.200> something

00:03:59.399 --> 00:03:59.409 
limonium oil does break but something

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:01.589 
limonium oil does break but something
like<00:03:59.500> duct<00:03:59.859> tape<00:04:00.040> available<00:04:00.159> stronger<00:04:00.939> well

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
like duct tape available stronger well

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:02.849 
like duct tape available stronger well
if<00:04:01.810> I<00:04:01.900> put<00:04:02.079> something<00:04:02.290> that's<00:04:02.379> stronger<00:04:02.769> in

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 
if I put something that's stronger in

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:04.619 
if I put something that's stronger in
the<00:04:02.920> front<00:04:03.189> and<00:04:03.400> weaker<00:04:03.669> in<00:04:03.700> the<00:04:03.790> back<00:04:04.030> the

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629 
the front and weaker in the back the

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:06.330 
the front and weaker in the back the
back<00:04:04.840> one<00:04:05.139> will<00:04:05.409> break<00:04:05.620> before<00:04:05.799> the<00:04:06.010> front

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
back one will break before the front

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.099 
back one will break before the front
that's<00:04:06.819> how<00:04:06.939> I<00:04:06.970> wanted<00:04:07.239> to<00:04:07.329> do<00:04:07.480> so<00:04:07.870> I<00:04:07.900> won't

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109 
that's how I wanted to do so I won't

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:09.569 
that's how I wanted to do so I won't
have<00:04:08.230> to<00:04:08.379> worry<00:04:08.560> about<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:09.250> front<00:04:09.400> one

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
have to worry about the front one

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:11.129 
have to worry about the front one
accidentally<00:04:10.060> breaking<00:04:10.239> before<00:04:10.480> the<00:04:10.720> back<00:04:10.900> in

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:11.139 
accidentally breaking before the back in

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:12.599 
accidentally breaking before the back in
shooting<00:04:11.470> the<00:04:11.560> ping<00:04:11.739> pong<00:04:11.769> ball<00:04:11.919> out<00:04:12.250> the<00:04:12.459> back

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:12.609 
shooting the ping pong ball out the back

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:15.809 
shooting the ping pong ball out the back
which<00:04:12.909> ruins<00:04:13.419> it<00:04:14.220> so<00:04:15.220> I'm<00:04:15.400> going<00:04:15.489> to<00:04:15.549> try<00:04:15.760> it

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
which ruins it so I'm going to try it

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:17.219 
which ruins it so I'm going to try it
with<00:04:16.000> aluminium<00:04:16.539> in<00:04:16.630> the<00:04:16.690> back<00:04:16.840> which<00:04:17.049> I<00:04:17.139> know

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
with aluminium in the back which I know

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:18.870 
with aluminium in the back which I know
will<00:04:17.349> break<00:04:17.500> under<00:04:17.709> a<00:04:17.739> vacuum<00:04:17.889> and<00:04:18.579> I'll<00:04:18.699> try

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
will break under a vacuum and I'll try

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.550 
will break under a vacuum and I'll try
other<00:04:19.180> materials<00:04:19.660> like<00:04:19.780> paper<00:04:19.959> or<00:04:20.289> duct<00:04:20.500> tape

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
other materials like paper or duct tape

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.990 
other materials like paper or duct tape
and<00:04:20.889> see<00:04:21.099> if<00:04:21.220> they<00:04:21.340> don't<00:04:21.579> break<00:04:21.729> under<00:04:21.910> a

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
and see if they don't break under a

00:04:22.000 --> 00:05:02.939 
and see if they don't break under a
vacuum<00:04:22.330> and<00:04:22.509> see<00:04:22.630> if<00:04:22.720> they're<00:04:22.810> stronger

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:02.949 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:05.620 

so<00:05:03.949> the<00:05:04.130> a<00:05:04.160> limonium<00:05:04.520> file<00:05:04.760> is<00:05:04.940> not<00:05:05.090> working<00:05:05.449> I

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
so the a limonium file is not working I

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.500 
so the a limonium file is not working I
decided<00:05:06.290> to<00:05:06.590> use<00:05:06.830> packing<00:05:07.580> tape<00:05:07.760> we'll<00:05:08.270> see<00:05:08.419> if

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
decided to use packing tape we'll see if

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.719 
decided to use packing tape we'll see if
that<00:05:08.540> works<00:05:08.690> little<00:05:09.229> better<00:05:09.520> this<00:05:10.520> is<00:05:10.580> the

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
that works little better this is the

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:15.640

awesome
now<00:07:03.539> as<00:07:03.659> for<00:07:03.840> the<00:07:03.900> mediums<00:07:04.319> that<00:07:04.409> I<00:07:04.499> used<00:07:04.650> for

the<00:07:04.830> diaphragm<00:07:05.370> I<00:07:05.400> found<00:07:05.999> that<00:07:06.120> aluminium

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:06.930 
the diaphragm I found that aluminium

the diaphragm I found that aluminium
foil<00:07:07.139> was<00:07:07.319> okay<00:07:08.039> but<00:07:08.370> it<00:07:08.430> was<00:07:08.550> actually<00:07:08.969> pretty

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:09.210 
foil was okay but it was actually pretty

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.070 
foil was okay but it was actually pretty
mediocre<00:07:10.370> so<00:07:11.370> faint<00:07:11.669> I<00:07:11.819> I<00:07:12.150> believe<00:07:12.779> it's<00:07:12.930> made

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.080 
mediocre so faint I I believe it's made

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.469 
mediocre so faint I I believe it's made
of<00:07:13.199> sulfate<00:07:13.560> packing<00:07:14.129> tape<00:07:14.310> was<00:07:14.610> wonderful<00:07:15.330> it

00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:15.479 
of sulfate packing tape was wonderful it

00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:17.390 
of sulfate packing tape was wonderful it
could<00:07:15.599> hold<00:07:15.689> the<00:07:15.840> vacuum<00:07:16.199> so<00:07:16.560> he<00:07:16.680> so<00:07:17.039> you<00:07:17.099> could

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:17.400 
could hold the vacuum so he so you could

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.860 
could hold the vacuum so he so you could
just<00:07:17.430> turn<00:07:17.729> it<00:07:17.849> on<00:07:17.969> get<00:07:18.150> a<00:07:18.210> full<00:07:18.419> vacuum<00:07:18.749> and

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:18.870 
just turn it on get a full vacuum and

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:22.550 
just turn it on get a full vacuum and
then<00:07:19.020> pop<00:07:19.259> it<00:07:19.439> whenever<00:07:19.620> you<00:07:19.830> wanted<00:07:21.560> that

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 
then pop it whenever you wanted that

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.989 
then pop it whenever you wanted that
also<00:07:22.710> lets<00:07:22.949> you<00:07:23.039> have<00:07:23.159> the<00:07:23.249> full<00:07:23.430> power<00:07:23.639> of<00:07:23.789> the

00:07:23.989 --> 00:07:23.999 
also lets you have the full power of the

00:07:23.999 --> 00:07:26.420 
also lets you have the full power of the
of<00:07:24.479> the<00:07:24.749> cannon<00:07:25.110> and<00:07:25.259> I<00:07:25.949> could<00:07:26.189> not<00:07:26.279> believe

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:26.430 
of the cannon and I could not believe

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:28.519 
of the cannon and I could not believe
that<00:07:26.580> that<00:07:27.180> it<00:07:27.300> would<00:07:27.389> shoot<00:07:27.569> the<00:07:27.719> ping-pong

00:07:28.519 --> 00:07:28.529 
that that it would shoot the ping-pong

00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:30.559 
that that it would shoot the ping-pong
ball<00:07:28.740> that<00:07:28.949> fast<00:07:29.279> it'd<00:07:29.909> be<00:07:30.029> amazing<00:07:30.180> if<00:07:30.449> I

00:07:30.559 --> 00:07:30.569 
ball that fast it'd be amazing if I

00:07:30.569 --> 00:07:31.730 
ball that fast it'd be amazing if I
could<00:07:30.719> figure<00:07:30.870> out<00:07:30.960> a<00:07:31.080> way<00:07:31.169> to<00:07:31.199> replace<00:07:31.620> the

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:31.740 
could figure out a way to replace the

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.309 
could figure out a way to replace the
silicone<00:07:32.430> tape<00:07:32.639> because<00:07:32.939> the<00:07:33.629> thing<00:07:33.810> is<00:07:33.839> it

00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:34.319 
silicone tape because the thing is it

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:37.129 
silicone tape because the thing is it
takes<00:07:34.560> a<00:07:34.650> while<00:07:34.860> to<00:07:35.189> to<00:07:36.150> read<00:07:36.330> to<00:07:36.629> reload<00:07:36.960> the

00:07:37.129 --> 00:07:37.139 
takes a while to to read to reload the

00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:38.989 
takes a while to to read to reload the
gun<00:07:37.259> be<00:07:37.979> awesome<00:07:38.249> if<00:07:38.310> I<00:07:38.430> could<00:07:38.580> find<00:07:38.699> a<00:07:38.819> big

00:07:38.989 --> 00:07:38.999 
gun be awesome if I could find a big

00:07:38.999 --> 00:07:40.249 
gun be awesome if I could find a big
electronic<00:07:39.509> valve<00:07:39.749> that<00:07:39.870> would<00:07:39.990> just<00:07:40.110> open

00:07:40.249 --> 00:07:40.259 
electronic valve that would just open

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:41.929 
electronic valve that would just open
really<00:07:40.589> fast<00:07:40.800> but<00:07:41.009> I<00:07:41.069> doubt<00:07:41.400> I<00:07:41.460> could<00:07:41.669> find

00:07:41.929 --> 00:07:41.939 
really fast but I doubt I could find

00:07:41.939 --> 00:07:44.209 
really fast but I doubt I could find
something<00:07:42.089> that<00:07:42.240> open<00:07:42.479> that<00:07:42.689> fast<00:07:43.039> but<00:07:44.039> on<00:07:44.129> the

00:07:44.209 --> 00:07:44.219 
something that open that fast but on the

00:07:44.219 --> 00:07:46.100 
something that open that fast but on the
backside<00:07:44.400> where<00:07:45.330> it<00:07:45.419> only<00:07:45.509> has<00:07:45.689> to<00:07:45.810> have<00:07:45.900> air

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:46.110 
backside where it only has to have air

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:47.540 
backside where it only has to have air
go<00:07:46.259> through<00:07:46.289> I<00:07:46.529> could<00:07:47.009> find<00:07:47.249> something<00:07:47.460> that

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:47.550 
go through I could find something that

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.249 
go through I could find something that
would<00:07:47.610> open<00:07:47.729> fast<00:07:48.060> enough<00:07:48.360> but<00:07:48.599> it<00:07:48.900> still
