the<00:02:42.609> intuitive<00:02:43.120> operation<00:02:43.840> of<00:02:43.959> this<00:02:44.079> were<00:02:44.290> a

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
the intuitive operation of this were a

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.170 
the intuitive operation of this were a
technical<00:02:45.220> director<00:02:45.310> is<00:02:45.700> not<00:02:45.849> really<00:02:46.150> that

300 so that kind of product design that

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.370 
300 so that kind of product design that
they<00:02:52.150> put<00:02:52.389> into<00:02:52.630> it<00:02:52.750> and<00:02:52.870> that<00:02:53.019> sort<00:02:53.230> of

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
they put into it and that sort of

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.280 
they put into it and that sort of
intuitive<00:02:54.010> design<00:02:54.190> that<00:02:54.609> they<00:02:54.760> put<00:02:54.970> into<00:02:55.120> it

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
intuitive design that they put into it

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.960 
intuitive design that they put into it
it<00:02:56.290> makes<00:02:56.319> it<00:02:56.709> for<00:02:56.889> a<00:02:56.950> pretty<00:02:57.099> easy<00:02:57.370> decision

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.010 
have to say and I think it's made a huge
difference<00:04:23.340> in<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.240> product<00:04:24.630> that's<00:04:24.810> been

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
difference in the product that's been

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.140 
difference in the product that's been
developed<00:04:25.470> that<00:04:25.680> is<00:04:25.889> a<00:04:25.919> great<00:04:26.190> attribute<00:04:26.430> on

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
developed that is a great attribute on

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.840 
developed that is a great attribute on
their<00:04:27.360> part<00:04:27.600> because<00:04:27.750> they<00:04:28.260> took<00:04:28.530> a<00:04:28.850> ground-up

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
their part because they took a ground-up

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
their part because they took a ground-up
approach<00:04:30.000> to<00:04:31.580> design<00:04:32.580> and<00:04:32.910> consultation<00:04:33.690> and

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
approach to design and consultation and

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.629 
approach to design and consultation and
so<00:04:34.050> on<00:04:34.199> with<00:04:34.440> the<00:04:34.590> technical<00:04:35.040> directors<00:04:35.460> as

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
so on with the technical directors as

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.159 
so on with the technical directors as
opposed<00:04:36.030> to<00:04:36.120> some<00:04:36.360> companies<00:04:36.810> that<00:04:36.840> went

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
opposed to some companies that went

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.230 
opposed to some companies that went
trying<00:04:37.530> to<00:04:37.650> do<00:04:37.800> a<00:04:37.830> top-down<00:04:38.250> approach<00:04:38.490> and

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
trying to do a top-down approach and

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.240 
trying to do a top-down approach and
that<00:04:39.479> that<00:04:39.930> doesn't<00:04:40.169> work<00:04:40.440> you<00:04:40.710> have<00:04:40.889> to<00:04:40.919> have

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
that that doesn't work you have to have

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.400 
that that doesn't work you have to have
the<00:04:42.120> input<00:04:42.300> from<00:04:42.750> the<00:04:42.930> people<00:04:43.229> that<00:04:43.260> actually

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
the input from the people that actually

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:49.700 
the input from the people that actually
drive<00:04:43.949> these<00:04:44.190> things<00:04:44.460> every<00:04:44.729> day<00:04:47.840> so<00:04:48.840> part<00:04:49.620> of

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
drive these things every day so part of

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.980 
drive these things every day so part of
this<00:04:49.830> is<00:04:50.240> technologically<00:04:51.240> how<00:04:51.449> do<00:04:51.630> we<00:04:51.780> look

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
this is technologically how do we look

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.779 
this is technologically how do we look
the<00:04:52.560> other<00:04:52.680> part<00:04:53.010> of<00:04:53.070> this<00:04:53.160> is<00:04:53.340> probably<00:04:53.669> the

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789 
the other part of this is probably the

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:54.920 
the other part of this is probably the
most<00:04:53.820> important<00:04:54.449> is<00:04:54.539> how<00:04:54.570> does<00:04:54.840> the

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
most important is how does the

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.870 
most important is how does the
technology<00:04:55.139> allow<00:04:55.800> us<00:04:55.949> to<00:04:56.070> tell<00:04:56.250> stories<00:04:56.280> and

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
technology allow us to tell stories and

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.180 
technology allow us to tell stories and
we<00:04:57.570> have<00:04:57.720> found<00:04:57.960> with<00:04:58.229> our<00:04:58.380> relationship<00:04:59.010> and

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
we have found with our relationship and

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.980 
we have found with our relationship and
our<00:04:59.220> partnership<00:04:59.789> with<00:04:59.940> gamefreak<00:05:00.389> that<00:05:00.810> it's

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
our partnership with gamefreak that it's

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.830 
our partnership with gamefreak that it's
been<00:05:01.139> a<00:05:01.169> home<00:05:01.380> run<00:05:01.530> for<00:05:01.740> us
