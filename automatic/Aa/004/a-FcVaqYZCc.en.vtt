given<00:02:19.219> the<00:02:19.370> fact<00:02:19.639> that<00:02:19.819> making<00:02:20.659> an<00:02:20.930> honest

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
given the fact that making an honest

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.099 
given the fact that making an honest
dollar<00:02:22.129> in<00:02:22.579> places<00:02:23.150> like<00:02:23.180> old<00:02:23.599> wine<00:02:23.870> has

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:24.109 
dollar in places like old wine has

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:26.259 
dollar in places like old wine has
gotten<00:02:24.409> harder<00:02:24.799> over<00:02:25.069> the<00:02:25.189> years<00:02:25.519> through<00:02:25.819> the

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
gotten harder over the years through the

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.239 
gotten harder over the years through the
consolidation<00:02:27.230> of<00:02:27.319> the<00:02:27.469> agricultural

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:28.249 
consolidation of the agricultural

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:30.039 
consolidation of the agricultural
industry<00:02:28.340> there's<00:02:28.999> been<00:02:29.209> more<00:02:29.420> of<00:02:29.569> an<00:02:29.689> onus

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
industry there's been more of an onus

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.220 
industry there's been more of an onus
placed<00:02:30.409> on<00:02:30.739> having<00:02:31.189> to<00:02:31.400> work<00:02:31.670> harder<00:02:32.540> for<00:02:32.870> less

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
placed on having to work harder for less

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.009 
placed on having to work harder for less
I<00:02:33.590> think<00:02:34.489> that<00:02:34.639> that<00:02:34.670> contributed<00:02:35.540> greatly<00:02:35.569> to

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
I think that that contributed greatly to

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.229 
I think that that contributed greatly to
the<00:02:36.230> attractiveness<00:02:37.010> of<00:02:37.239> methamphetamine

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
the attractiveness of methamphetamine

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.050 
the attractiveness of methamphetamine
yeah<00:02:38.689> you<00:02:38.750> tie<00:02:39.349> the<00:02:39.409> rise<00:02:39.829> of<00:02:40.189> meth<00:02:40.459> in<00:02:40.489> this

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
yeah you tie the rise of meth in this

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.839 
yeah you tie the rise of meth in this
town<00:02:41.269> directly<00:02:41.989> to<00:02:42.620> what's<00:02:42.799> going<00:02:43.129> on<00:02:43.249> with

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
town directly to what's going on with

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:45.750 
town directly to what's going on with
farming<00:02:44.389> with<00:02:44.689> big<00:02:44.930> agriculture

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
farming with big agriculture

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.709 
farming with big agriculture
consolidation<00:02:46.760> of<00:02:46.819> industry<00:02:47.269> as<00:02:47.359> you<00:02:47.510> just

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:47.719 
consolidation of industry as you just

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:50.860 
consolidation of industry as you just
mentioned<00:02:47.780> yeah<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:49.489> principal<00:02:50.120> industries

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
mentioned yeah the principal industries

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.459 
mentioned yeah the principal industries
that<00:02:51.199> that<00:02:51.560> made<00:02:51.919> rural<00:02:52.819> America<00:02:53.629> strong

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:54.469 
that that made rural America strong

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:57.220 
that that made rural America strong
almost<00:02:55.370> all<00:02:55.579> of<00:02:55.790> those<00:02:56.030> have<00:02:56.389> been<00:02:56.629> diminished

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
almost all of those have been diminished

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.649 
almost all of those have been diminished
to<00:02:57.409> the<00:02:57.439> point<00:02:57.560> or<00:02:58.040> gourd<00:02:58.430> been<00:02:58.659> consolidated

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:21.949 
happened with consolidation and wages

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:25.929 
happened with consolidation and wages
well<00:03:22.790> at<00:03:23.389> one<00:03:23.629> time<00:03:23.930> there<00:03:24.470> was<00:03:24.769> a<00:03:24.939> meatpacking

00:03:25.929 --> 00:03:25.939 
well at one time there was a meatpacking

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:27.610 
well at one time there was a meatpacking
plant<00:03:26.389> they're<00:03:26.659> owned<00:03:26.840> by<00:03:26.870> a<00:03:27.109> company<00:03:27.349> called

plant they're owned by a company called

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.219 
plant they're owned by a company called
Iowa<00:03:28.310> ham<00:03:28.519> this<00:03:28.790> would<00:03:29.030> be<00:03:29.150> back<00:03:29.359> in<00:03:29.569> the<00:03:29.659> 70s

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:30.229 
Iowa ham this would be back in the 70s

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:33.580 
Iowa ham this would be back in the 70s
and<00:03:30.379> the<00:03:30.409> 80s<00:03:30.500> and<00:03:31.009> back<00:03:31.879> in<00:03:32.290> 1987<00:03:33.290> you<00:03:33.409> could

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
and the 80s and back in 1987 you could

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.679 
and the 80s and back in 1987 you could
make<00:03:33.769> eighteen<00:03:34.250> dollars<00:03:34.459> an<00:03:34.819> hour<00:03:35.000> that's

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:35.689 
make eighteen dollars an hour that's

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:37.689 
make eighteen dollars an hour that's
good<00:03:36.379> money<00:03:36.650> that's<00:03:37.040> enough<00:03:37.400> for<00:03:37.639> a

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:37.699 
good money that's enough for a

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:41.140 
good money that's enough for a
lower-middle-class<00:03:38.560> living<00:03:39.909> eventually<00:03:40.909> and

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
lower-middle-class living eventually and

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.229 
lower-middle-class living eventually and
I<00:03:41.239> think<00:03:41.509> about<00:03:41.720> 92<00:03:42.379> the<00:03:43.129> plant<00:03:43.459> was<00:03:43.639> bought<00:03:43.939> by

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
I think about 92 the plant was bought by

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.469 
I think about 92 the plant was bought by
Gillette<00:03:44.840> and<00:03:45.280> wages<00:03:46.280> went<00:03:46.579> from<00:03:46.970> eighteen

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:47.479 
Gillette and wages went from eighteen

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:50.349 
Gillette and wages went from eighteen
dollars<00:03:47.720> an<00:03:48.139> hour<00:03:48.290> to<00:03:48.919> I<00:03:49.310> think<00:03:49.549> about<00:03:49.669> six<00:03:50.150> dot

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:50.359 
dollars an hour to I think about six dot

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:53.559 
dollars an hour to I think about six dot
twenty<00:03:51.049> cents<00:03:51.439> and<00:03:51.650> then<00:03:52.609> the<00:03:52.819> plant<00:03:53.419> was

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
twenty cents and then the plant was

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:55.509 
twenty cents and then the plant was
bought<00:03:53.840> a<00:03:53.870> couple<00:03:54.199> more<00:03:54.560> times<00:03:54.799> throughout

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
bought a couple more times throughout

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.479 
bought a couple more times throughout
the<00:03:55.729> course<00:03:55.969> of<00:03:56.120> the<00:03:56.269> next<00:03:56.449> five<00:03:56.719> to<00:03:57.019> ten<00:03:57.229> years

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
the course of the next five to ten years

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.459 
the course of the next five to ten years
so<00:03:58.489> if<00:03:58.849> you're<00:03:59.090> a<00:03:59.150> guy<00:03:59.419> like<00:03:59.719> Roland<00:04:00.259> Jarvis

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:00.469 
so if you're a guy like Roland Jarvis

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:03.939 
so if you're a guy like Roland Jarvis
and<00:04:01.040> now<00:04:01.219> you've<00:04:01.699> got<00:04:02.000> to<00:04:02.150> work<00:04:02.359> extra<00:04:03.319> hard<00:04:03.349> to

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:03.949 
and now you've got to work extra hard to

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:05.740 
and now you've got to work extra hard to
be<00:04:04.099> able<00:04:04.250> to<00:04:04.549> make<00:04:04.729> less<00:04:05.090> than<00:04:05.120> you<00:04:05.509> were

yesterday meth is often seen as a very

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.990 
yesterday meth is often seen as a very
helpful<00:04:09.379> drug<00:04:09.919> in<00:04:10.099> that<00:04:10.280> instance<00:04:10.759> because

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
helpful drug in that instance because

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.319 
helpful drug in that instance because
you<00:04:11.870> don't<00:04:12.079> even<00:04:12.229> have<00:04:12.530> to<00:04:12.829> go<00:04:13.459> to<00:04:13.489> bed<00:04:13.879> before

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
working your next shift eventually a guy

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.170 
working your next shift eventually a guy
like<00:04:18.349> Roland<00:04:18.919> did<00:04:19.159> the<00:04:19.310> math<00:04:19.549> and<00:04:19.820> he<00:04:19.940> said

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
like Roland did the math and he said

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.360 
like Roland did the math and he said
well<00:04:20.359> I<00:04:20.389> can<00:04:20.750> either<00:04:20.900> keep<00:04:21.229> working<00:04:22.070> twice<00:04:22.310> as

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
well I can either keep working twice as

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.719

with<00:04:40.130> meth<00:04:40.280> production<00:04:40.520> and<00:04:41.180> oelwein<00:04:41.630> what

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
with meth production and oelwein what

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.740 
with meth production and oelwein what
did<00:04:42.050> he<00:04:42.140> do<00:04:42.260> right<00:04:42.760> well<00:04:43.760> it's<00:04:44.060> a<00:04:44.420> little<00:04:44.630> bit

did he do right well it's a little bit
like<00:04:44.900> what<00:04:45.110> happened<00:04:45.470> with<00:04:45.500> Giuliani<00:04:46.130> in<00:04:46.400> New

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
like what happened with Giuliani in New

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.670 
like what happened with Giuliani in New
York<00:04:46.790> City<00:04:47.090> and<00:04:47.360> Bratton<00:04:47.870> I<00:04:48.140> think<00:04:48.350> was<00:04:48.560> his

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
York City and Bratton I think was his

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.800 
York City and Bratton I think was his
police<00:04:49.010> chief<00:04:49.160> anyway<00:04:49.430> but<00:04:49.850> to<00:04:50.000> not<00:04:50.150> let<00:04:50.540> any

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
police chief anyway but to not let any

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.220 
police chief anyway but to not let any
small<00:04:51.230> things<00:04:51.620> go<00:04:52.040> unnoticed<00:04:53.030> meaning<00:04:53.840> you

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
small things go unnoticed meaning you

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.650 
small things go unnoticed meaning you
know<00:04:54.350> if<00:04:54.410> somebody<00:04:54.770> is<00:04:55.030> speeding<00:04:56.030> just<00:04:56.540> a

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
know if somebody is speeding just a

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.230 
know if somebody is speeding just a
little<00:04:57.020> bit<00:04:57.260> then<00:04:57.830> that<00:04:58.430> constitutes

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
little bit then that constitutes

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.450 
little bit then that constitutes
speeding<00:04:59.810> so<00:05:00.080> let's<00:05:00.290> pull<00:05:00.560> them<00:05:00.710> over<00:05:00.890> and<00:05:01.250> and

mid-2006<00:05:48.290> so<00:05:48.770> to<00:05:49.460> go<00:05:49.640> from<00:05:49.910> getting<00:05:50.419> a<00:05:50.600> lab

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 
mid-2006 so to go from getting a lab

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.890 
mid-2006 so to go from getting a lab
every<00:05:52.280> few<00:05:52.669> days<00:05:52.940> to<00:05:53.870> having<00:05:54.410> zero<00:05:55.190> is<00:05:55.550> a

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900 
every few days to having zero is a

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.740 
every few days to having zero is a
remarkable<00:05:56.900> success<00:05:57.520> but<00:05:58.520> meth<00:05:59.060> use<00:05:59.419> is

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
remarkable success but meth use is

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.170 
remarkable success but meth use is
clearly<00:06:00.410> still<00:06:00.740> going<00:06:00.980> on<00:06:01.100> in<00:06:01.280> all<00:06:01.370> in<00:06:01.580> Iowa<00:06:01.910> it

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.409 
clearly still going on in all in Iowa it
is<00:06:02.780> and<00:06:03.290> I<00:06:03.470> think<00:06:03.800> that's<00:06:04.040> where<00:06:04.400> you<00:06:04.910> have<00:06:05.150> to

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:05.419 
is and I think that's where you have to

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:08.700 
is and I think that's where you have to
look<00:06:05.660> at<00:06:06.020> the<00:06:06.530> Mexican<00:06:07.430> drug<00:06:07.730> trafficking

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
look at the Mexican drug trafficking

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:11.500 
look at the Mexican drug trafficking
component<00:06:09.710> of<00:06:09.860> all<00:06:10.100> this<00:06:10.340> when<00:06:11.180> you<00:06:11.270> take<00:06:11.480> away

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:11.510 
component of all this when you take away

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.290 
component of all this when you take away
the<00:06:12.080> ability<00:06:12.650> to<00:06:13.100> make<00:06:13.130> the<00:06:13.669> stuff<00:06:14.000> in<00:06:14.270> your

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
the ability to make the stuff in your

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.960 
the ability to make the stuff in your
house<00:06:14.690> you're<00:06:15.380> not<00:06:15.530> taking<00:06:15.740> away<00:06:16.280> people's

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:16.970 
house you're not taking away people's

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.600 
house you're not taking away people's
addiction<00:06:17.900> to<00:06:18.140> it<00:06:18.169> all<00:06:18.530> you're<00:06:18.980> doing<00:06:19.010> is

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:19.610 
addiction to it all you're doing is

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.450 
addiction to it all you're doing is
opening<00:06:20.270> up<00:06:20.750> the<00:06:21.050> market<00:06:21.350> to<00:06:21.800> the<00:06:21.890> trafficking

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
opening up the market to the trafficking

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.909 
opening up the market to the trafficking
organizations<00:06:23.300> those<00:06:24.140> are<00:06:24.440> much<00:06:24.650> more

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:24.919 
organizations those are much more

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:28.030 
organizations those are much more
difficult<00:06:25.190> to<00:06:25.669> contend<00:06:26.060> with<00:06:26.710> what<00:06:27.710> would<00:06:27.919> you

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.040 
difficult to contend with what would you

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.420 
difficult to contend with what would you
say<00:06:28.250> to<00:06:28.630> those<00:06:29.630> who<00:06:29.990> have<00:06:30.169> reported<00:06:30.770> in<00:06:30.980> recent

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:31.430 
say to those who have reported in recent

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.610 
say to those who have reported in recent
years<00:06:31.520> that<00:06:31.850> the<00:06:32.150> meth<00:06:32.330> epidemic<00:06:32.510> was<00:06:33.050> wildly

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
years that the meth epidemic was wildly

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.710 
years that the meth epidemic was wildly
overblown<00:06:34.550> contributed<00:06:35.270> to<00:06:35.360> the<00:06:35.479> sort<00:06:35.660> of

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:35.720 
overblown contributed to the sort of

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.770 
overblown contributed to the sort of
frenzy<00:06:36.080> of<00:06:36.110> panic<00:06:36.620> about<00:06:36.770> math<00:06:37.610> I<00:06:37.940> would<00:06:38.840> say

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:39.780 
frenzy of panic about math I would say

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.290 
frenzy of panic about math I would say
that<00:06:39.960> I<00:06:40.260> never<00:06:40.710> saw<00:06:41.070> any<00:06:41.370> of<00:06:41.490> them<00:06:41.790> when<00:06:42.030> I<00:06:42.060> was

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300 
that I never saw any of them when I was

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.480 
that I never saw any of them when I was
walking<00:06:42.540> down<00:06:42.750> the<00:06:43.020> street<00:06:43.290> in<00:06:43.380> old<00:06:43.530> one<00:06:43.800> or<00:06:44.100> in

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.490 
walking down the street in old one or in

walking down the street in old one or in
any<00:06:44.700> of<00:06:44.790> the<00:06:44.910> other<00:06:45.060> places<00:06:45.630> that<00:06:45.660> I<00:06:45.870> spent

any of the other places that I spent

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:49.490 
any of the other places that I spent
four<00:06:46.770> years<00:06:46.800> going<00:06:47.490> back<00:06:47.790> and<00:06:48.000> forth<00:06:48.270> to<00:06:48.570> the

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:49.500 
four years going back and forth to the

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.500 
four years going back and forth to the
thing<00:06:49.770> that<00:06:49.950> the<00:06:50.100> media<00:06:50.490> could<00:06:50.820> justifiably

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:51.510 
thing that the media could justifiably

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.770 
thing that the media could justifiably
be<00:06:51.870> criticized<00:06:52.680> for<00:06:52.919> is<00:06:53.419> missing<00:06:54.419> the<00:06:54.570> point

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:54.780 
be criticized for is missing the point

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.290 
be criticized for is missing the point
with<00:06:55.169> meth<00:06:55.470> the<00:06:56.250> point<00:06:56.550> is<00:06:56.730> really<00:06:57.000> not

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300 
with meth the point is really not

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.210 
with meth the point is really not
entirely<00:06:57.810> that<00:06:58.169> people<00:06:58.500> make<00:06:58.710> it<00:06:58.889> in<00:06:59.010> their

00:06:59.210 --> 00:06:59.220 
entirely that people make it in their

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.040 
entirely that people make it in their
homes<00:06:59.460> the<00:06:59.820> point<00:07:00.090> i<00:07:00.270> think<00:07:00.600> is<00:07:00.780> that<00:07:00.930> it

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.050 
homes the point i think is that it

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.710 
homes the point i think is that it
stands<00:07:01.410> for<00:07:01.889> something<00:07:02.190> much<00:07:03.000> bigger<00:07:03.360> in

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 
stands for something much bigger in

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.990 
stands for something much bigger in
american<00:07:04.320> culture<00:07:04.530> which<00:07:04.950> is<00:07:05.130> the<00:07:05.280> demise<00:07:05.669> of

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 
american culture which is the demise of

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.140 
american culture which is the demise of
small<00:07:06.330> town<00:07:06.570> America<00:07:06.950> so<00:07:07.950> in<00:07:08.460> some<00:07:08.970> ways<00:07:09.000> I

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:09.150 
small town America so in some ways I

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.240 
small town America so in some ways I
think<00:07:09.270> the<00:07:09.600> criticism<00:07:09.930> that<00:07:10.260> meth<00:07:10.889> has<00:07:11.070> been

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:11.250 
think the criticism that meth has been

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:14.090 
think the criticism that meth has been
overblown<00:07:11.700> that<00:07:12.690> misses<00:07:13.260> the<00:07:13.290> point<00:07:13.650> in<00:07:13.950> the

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:14.100 
overblown that misses the point in the

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.940 
overblown that misses the point in the
same<00:07:14.310> way<00:07:14.640> that<00:07:14.940> media<00:07:15.390> attention<00:07:15.870> to<00:07:16.830> the
