00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.649 
want forward coming into our solar
atmosphere<00:06:41.669> and<00:06:42.389> bring<00:06:43.380> some<00:06:44.479> terrible<00:06:45.479> earth

00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:45.659 
atmosphere and bring some terrible earth

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:51.140 
atmosphere and bring some terrible earth
changes<00:06:46.550> but<00:06:47.659> 2012<00:06:48.659> is<00:06:49.469> going<00:06:50.130> to<00:06:50.279> be<00:06:50.490> a<00:06:50.669> point

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.150 
changes but 2012 is going to be a point

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.600 
changes but 2012 is going to be a point
I<00:06:51.389> think<00:06:51.599> it's<00:06:51.870> just<00:06:52.050> a<00:06:52.139> point<00:06:52.440> out<00:06:52.650> there<00:06:52.979> it's

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:53.610 
I think it's just a point out there it's

00:06:53.610 --> 00:07:00.249 
I think it's just a point out there it's
a<00:06:53.729> timeline<00:06:54.860> from<00:06:55.860> the<00:06:56.099> Mayans<00:06:56.610> of<00:06:57.080> that<00:06:58.080> is

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:00.259 
a timeline from the Mayans of that is

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:03.290 
a timeline from the Mayans of that is
designating<00:07:01.259> that<00:07:01.610> we<00:07:02.610> are<00:07:02.729> going<00:07:03.060> to<00:07:03.210> be

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:03.300 
designating that we are going to be

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.140 
designating that we are going to be
shifting<00:07:03.870> our<00:07:04.349> consciousness<00:07:05.159> into<00:07:05.460> more<00:07:06.120> of

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:06.150 
shifting our consciousness into more of

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.800 
shifting our consciousness into more of
a<00:07:06.330> universal<00:07:07.099> consciousness<00:07:08.099> of<00:07:09.090> another

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:09.810 
a universal consciousness of another

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:12.170 
a universal consciousness of another
identity<00:07:10.440> and<00:07:10.979> that<00:07:11.250> would<00:07:11.400> be<00:07:11.520> like<00:07:11.729> before

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:12.180 
identity and that would be like before

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.749 
identity and that would be like before
and<00:07:12.479> fifth<00:07:13.139> density<00:07:13.379> and<00:07:13.919> the<00:07:14.460> transformation

00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:14.759 
and fifth density and the transformation

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:18.890 
and fifth density and the transformation
of<00:07:15.479> our<00:07:15.990> consciousness<00:07:16.259> means<00:07:16.949> the<00:07:17.900> evolution

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:18.900 
of our consciousness means the evolution

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.830 
of our consciousness means the evolution
of<00:07:18.960> lunacy

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:20.840 
of lunacy

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.820 
of lunacy
for<00:07:21.470> supreme<00:07:21.919> or<00:07:22.250> supernatural<00:07:22.960> he<00:07:23.960> is<00:07:24.169> kind
