raise<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.670> grain<00:01:59.939> but<00:02:00.930> these<00:02:01.079> alcohol-based

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
raise the grain but these alcohol-based

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.310 
raise the grain but these alcohol-based
don't<00:02:02.909> raise<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.270> grain<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:03.780> can<00:02:03.990> stain

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
don't raise the grain so you can stain

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.229 
don't raise the grain so you can stain
finish<00:02:04.799> tint<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.030> be<00:02:06.719> done<00:02:06.990> if<00:02:07.469> needed<00:02:08.039> so<00:02:08.940> I

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
colors I'll make my next burst guitar

with this red brown and yellow and show

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.600 
with this red brown and yellow and show
you<00:02:41.260> kind<00:02:41.590> of<00:02:41.650> how<00:02:41.710> that<00:02:41.860> works

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
you kind of how that works

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.430 
you kind of how that works
not<00:02:43.030> as<00:02:43.150> much<00:02:43.390> sanding<00:02:43.900> you<00:02:44.080> don't<00:02:44.260> have<00:02:44.350> the

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
not as much sanding you don't have the

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.740 
not as much sanding you don't have the
grain<00:02:44.680> raised<00:02:45.120> so<00:02:46.120> it<00:02:46.210> actually<00:02:46.480> goes<00:02:46.630> a

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
grain raised so it actually goes a

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.570 
grain raised so it actually goes a
little<00:02:46.930> bit<00:02:47.020> quicker<00:02:47.220> then<00:02:48.220> with<00:02:48.460> the

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
little bit quicker then with the

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.010 
little bit quicker then with the
water-based<00:02:48.970> stains<00:02:49.330> you<00:02:49.480> have<00:02:49.600> to<00:02:49.720> let<00:02:49.900> it

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
water-based stains you have to let it

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.020 
water-based stains you have to let it
dry<00:02:50.230> as<00:02:50.290> long<00:02:50.650> but<00:02:51.490> you<00:02:51.610> do<00:02:51.730> have<00:02:51.850> to<00:02:51.940> be

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
dry as long but you do have to be

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.210 
dry as long but you do have to be
careful<00:02:52.480> is<00:02:52.690> and<00:02:53.410> once<00:02:53.620> you<00:02:53.740> put<00:02:53.980> this<00:02:54.160> down

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
careful is and once you put this down

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.420 
careful is and once you put this down
it's<00:02:54.850> a<00:02:54.910> little<00:02:55.060> bit<00:02:55.150> harder<00:02:55.480> to<00:02:55.510> watercolor

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
it's a little bit harder to watercolor

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.280 
it's a little bit harder to watercolor
with<00:02:57.430> this<00:02:57.700> type<00:02:57.910> of<00:02:57.940> finish<00:02:58.360> then<00:02:59.020> with<00:02:59.170> the

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
with this type of finish then with the

with this type of finish then with the
water-based<00:02:59.770> finish<00:03:00.160> once<00:03:00.370> you<00:03:00.490> put<00:03:00.730> this

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
water-based finish once you put this

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.000 
water-based finish once you put this
down<00:03:01.150> you're<00:03:01.840> pretty<00:03:02.080> much<00:03:02.260> down<00:03:02.530> you<00:03:02.800> got<00:03:02.920> to

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
down you're pretty much down you got to

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.950
