00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
around with the furrowed and the linear

my<00:00:23.369> knives<00:00:23.580> come<00:00:23.820> with<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.090> as<00:00:24.210> long<00:00:24.330> as<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.570> have

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
my knives come with it as long as I have

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.179 
my knives come with it as long as I have
them<00:00:24.900> in<00:00:24.990> stock<00:00:25.109> I<00:00:25.260> always<00:00:25.560> added<00:00:25.949> with<00:00:26.099> the

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
knife or whatever you buy and I think

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.620 
knife or whatever you buy and I think
it's<00:00:28.949> great<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.310> like<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:29.970> but<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.210> had<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.480> idea

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
it's great I like it but I had the idea

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.959 
it's great I like it but I had the idea
to<00:00:30.900> utilize<00:00:31.380> even<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.949> other<00:00:32.130> side<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.610> the

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
to utilize even the other side of the

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.270 
to utilize even the other side of the
other<00:00:33.270> simple<00:00:34.200> simple<00:00:34.500> in<00:00:34.680> yet<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:34.890> don't<00:00:34.950> think

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
other simple simple in yet I don't think

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.520 
other simple simple in yet I don't think
it<00:00:35.670> should<00:00:35.850> be<00:00:35.880> called<00:00:36.090> linear<00:00:36.360> which<00:00:37.320> some

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
it should be called linear which some

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.229 
it should be called linear which some
people<00:00:37.649> would<00:00:37.860> love<00:00:38.070> about<00:00:38.399> his<00:00:38.640> ninjas<00:00:39.030> when

it when they pull it out I personally
don't<00:00:49.739> like<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.100> dangling<00:00:50.640> down<00:00:50.850> but<00:00:51.180> when<00:00:51.390> it

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
don't like the dangling down but when it

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.660 
don't like the dangling down but when it
has<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.690> features<00:00:52.620> well<00:00:52.770> actually<00:00:52.949> has<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.309> use

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670

I'm all for it i really like it so the
idea<00:00:58.050> i<00:00:58.320> had<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:59.100> improve<00:00:59.640> my<00:00:59.969> furrowed

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
idea i had to improve my furrowed

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.900 
idea i had to improve my furrowed
lynette<00:01:00.870> was<00:01:01.500> especially<00:01:02.010> for<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.460> folding

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
lynette was especially for the folding

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.729 
lynette was especially for the folding
knives<00:01:03.120> now<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.660> could<00:01:03.930> be<00:01:04.110> done<00:01:04.260> even<00:01:04.439> for

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
knives now this could be done even for

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.950 
knives now this could be done even for
the<00:01:04.830> fixed<00:01:05.159> blades<00:01:05.400> which<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.420> also<00:01:06.689> actually

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
the fixed blades which is also actually

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.410 
the fixed blades which is also actually
very<00:01:07.320> nice<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.890> all<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.640> would<00:01:08.790> take<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:09.000> just

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
very nice and all it would take is just

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.260 
very nice and all it would take is just
order<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.810> different<00:01:10.170> size<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:11.369> what<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.090> was

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
order the different size so what I was

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.690 
order the different size so what I was
doing<00:01:12.570> was<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.810> was<00:01:13.020> looking<00:01:13.380> for<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:14.430> right

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
doing was I was looking for the right

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.920 
doing was I was looking for the right
size<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.600> style<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.439> torx<00:01:17.310> bits<00:01:17.580> or<00:01:18.000> pretty

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
size and style of a torx bits or pretty

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.560 
size and style of a torx bits or pretty
much<00:01:18.960> anything<00:01:19.320> even<00:01:19.650> when<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.890> do<00:01:20.009> the

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
much anything even when you do the

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.210 
much anything even when you do the
Phillips<00:01:21.570> screwdrivers<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.170> Phillips<00:01:22.530> large

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
Phillips screwdrivers the Phillips large

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.160 
Phillips screwdrivers the Phillips large
it<00:01:23.430> works<00:01:23.640> for<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.970> fixed<00:01:24.330> blades<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.990> could

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
it works for the fixed blades it could

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.960 
it works for the fixed blades it could
be<00:01:25.259> implemented<00:01:26.070> pretty<00:01:26.220> much<00:01:26.340> for<00:01:26.549> any<00:01:26.759> night

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
be implemented pretty much for any night

want<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.810> clean<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.140> sometimes<00:01:37.590> take<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:37.979> apart

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
want to clean it sometimes take it apart

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.670 
want to clean it sometimes take it apart
in<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:39.060> case<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.540> fixed<00:01:39.960> blade<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.380> want<00:01:40.560> to

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
in a case of a fixed blade you want to

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.310 
in a case of a fixed blade you want to
take<00:01:40.950> off<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.220> scales<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.820> clean<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.270> or<00:01:42.420> if

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
take off the scales to clean it or if

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.600 
take off the scales to clean it or if
you<00:01:43.500> out<00:01:43.619> in<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.860> field<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.220> want<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.430> take<00:01:44.579> it

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
you out in the field you want to take it

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.460 
you out in the field you want to take it
off<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.090> can<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.570> know<00:01:45.630> let's<00:01:46.079> say<00:01:46.229> make<00:01:46.439> a

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
off so you can I know let's say make a

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.710 
off so you can I know let's say make a
spear<00:01:46.770> or<00:01:46.799> something<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.369> know<00:01:47.399> all<00:01:48.360> kinds<00:01:48.540> of

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
spear or something you know all kinds of

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.569 
spear or something you know all kinds of
things<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.200> could<00:01:49.380> do<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:50.070> what<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.250> did<00:01:50.369> I

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
things you could do so what I did I

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.880 
things you could do so what I did I
ordered<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.090> couple<00:01:51.299> different<00:01:51.740> styles<00:01:52.740> two

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
ordered a couple different styles two

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.300 
ordered a couple different styles two
different<00:01:52.920> styles<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:53.640> time

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
different styles this time

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.569 
different styles this time
and<00:01:54.520> the<00:01:55.329> one<00:01:55.600> is<00:01:55.780> actually<00:01:55.930> excellent<00:01:56.680> I<00:01:57.009> was

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
and the one is actually excellent I was

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:59.639 
and the one is actually excellent I was
kind<00:01:58.450> of<00:01:58.509> afraid<00:01:58.600> that<00:01:58.930> it<00:01:59.049> would<00:01:59.140> be<00:01:59.259> too<00:01:59.439> big

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
kind of afraid that it would be too big

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:02.100 
kind of afraid that it would be too big
the<00:01:59.890> l-shaped<00:02:00.399> key<00:02:00.729> but<00:02:01.509> it<00:02:01.659> actually<00:02:01.840> is

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
the l-shaped key but it actually is

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.370 
the l-shaped key but it actually is
perfect<00:02:02.710> size<00:02:02.920> for<00:02:03.280> my<00:02:03.850> idea<00:02:04.270> what<00:02:04.479> I<00:02:04.509> had<00:02:04.780> so

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
perfect size for my idea what I had so

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.719 
perfect size for my idea what I had so
you<00:02:05.439> have<00:02:05.619> the<00:02:05.710> fur<00:02:05.890> you<00:02:06.189> have<00:02:06.220> the<00:02:06.399> furrowed

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
you have the fur you have the furrowed

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.550 
you have the fur you have the furrowed
Lynyrd<00:02:07.090> where<00:02:07.720> you<00:02:07.899> have<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.080> ferry<00:02:08.289> road<00:02:08.410> in

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
Lynyrd where you have the ferry road in

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.100 
Lynyrd where you have the ferry road in
this<00:02:08.739> thing<00:02:09.130> but<00:02:09.789> the<00:02:09.970> other<00:02:10.149> side<00:02:10.450> actually

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
this thing but the other side actually

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.460 
this thing but the other side actually
contains<00:02:11.650> as<00:02:12.040> you<00:02:12.550> see<00:02:12.819> nice<00:02:13.480> little<00:02:13.840> Torx<00:02:14.410> bit

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
contains as you see nice little Torx bit

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.290 
contains as you see nice little Torx bit
and<00:02:14.830> it's<00:02:14.980> about<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.730> same<00:02:15.910> size<00:02:16.239> the

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
and it's about the same size the

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.970 
and it's about the same size the
diameter<00:02:16.959> as<00:02:17.110> a<00:02:17.140> pharaoh<00:02:17.440> so<00:02:17.739> it's<00:02:17.860> actually

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
diameter as a pharaoh so it's actually

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.850 
diameter as a pharaoh so it's actually
very<00:02:18.190> nice<00:02:18.580> and<00:02:18.790> snug<00:02:19.060> fit<00:02:19.360> plus<00:02:20.019> once<00:02:20.500> i<00:02:20.650> put

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
very nice and snug fit plus once i put

see nice and snug fit there and you can

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.580 
see nice and snug fit there and you can
just<00:02:55.060> pull<00:02:55.299> it<00:02:55.390> out<00:02:55.540> you<00:02:55.810> know<00:02:55.930> you<00:02:56.019> can<00:02:56.290> slide

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
just pull it out you know you can slide

just pull it out you know you can slide
the<00:02:56.769> linear<00:02:57.099> down<00:02:57.340> you<00:02:57.970> can<00:02:58.180> pull<00:02:58.420> this<00:02:58.540> out

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
the linear down you can pull this out

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.060 
the linear down you can pull this out
easily<00:02:58.900> and<00:02:59.109> you<00:02:59.350> have<00:02:59.470> your<00:02:59.590> little<00:02:59.799> torque

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
easily and you have your little torque

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.099 
easily and you have your little torque
speed<00:03:00.310> which<00:03:00.790> in<00:03:01.209> this<00:03:01.359> case<00:03:01.420> I<00:03:01.840> have<00:03:02.079> a

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
speed which in this case I have a

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:04.140 
speed which in this case I have a

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.259 
different size but most of the nice and
i<00:03:05.799> will<00:03:06.010> do<00:03:06.160> it<00:03:06.280> definitely<00:03:06.700> in<00:03:06.760> the<00:03:06.850> future<00:03:07.120> to

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
i will do it definitely in the future to

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.330 
i will do it definitely in the future to
all<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:08.019> schools<00:03:08.140> will<00:03:08.440> be<00:03:08.470> one<00:03:08.799> size<00:03:09.070> the

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
all the schools will be one size the

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.420 
all the schools will be one size the
size<00:03:09.519> of<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:09.970> of<00:03:10.239> this<00:03:10.630> and<00:03:10.980> I<00:03:11.980> don't<00:03:12.100> promise

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
size of the of this and I don't promise

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.770 
size of the of this and I don't promise
that<00:03:12.670> it's<00:03:12.910> going<00:03:13.060> to<00:03:13.120> be<00:03:13.209> all<00:03:13.420> the<00:03:13.630> time

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
that it's going to be all the time

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.720 
that it's going to be all the time
because<00:03:13.930> these<00:03:14.200> are<00:03:14.500> for<00:03:15.010> what<00:03:15.190> it<00:03:15.280> is<00:03:15.370> small

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
because these are for what it is small

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.190 
because these are for what it is small
little<00:03:15.880> thing<00:03:16.090> this<00:03:16.239> is<00:03:16.359> pretty<00:03:16.510> high<00:03:16.720> quality

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
little thing this is pretty high quality

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.229 
little thing this is pretty high quality
actually<00:03:17.590> it's<00:03:17.709> supposed<00:03:17.980> to<00:03:18.069> be<00:03:18.220> and<00:03:19.000> I<00:03:19.090> can

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
actually it's supposed to be and I can

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:20.970 
actually it's supposed to be and I can
feel<00:03:19.450> it<00:03:19.569> on<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:19.720> house<00:03:19.989> nugget<00:03:20.470> feeds<00:03:20.709> in<00:03:20.829> the

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
feel it on the house nugget feeds in the

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.430 
feel it on the house nugget feeds in the
in<00:03:21.160> the<00:03:21.190> screws<00:03:21.850> it<00:03:22.660> looks<00:03:22.900> like<00:03:22.959> it<00:03:23.139> is<00:03:23.200> a<00:03:23.260> good

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
in the screws it looks like it is a good

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.420 
in the screws it looks like it is a good
quality<00:03:23.920> so<00:03:24.600> you<00:03:25.600> know<00:03:25.720> you<00:03:26.079> have<00:03:26.200> your

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
pulled it off and there

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.030 
pulled it off and there
finally<00:03:49.660> gonna<00:03:49.780> try<00:03:50.110> to<00:03:50.170> do<00:03:50.500> them<00:03:50.650> on<00:03:50.800> all<00:03:51.010> the

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
finally gonna try to do them on all the

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.350 
finally gonna try to do them on all the
knives<00:03:51.310> LC<00:03:52.140> and<00:03:53.140> maybe<00:03:53.769> down<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.010> road<00:03:54.360> if

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
knives LC and maybe down the road if

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.150 
knives LC and maybe down the road if
people<00:03:55.750> would<00:03:55.810> be<00:03:55.930> interested<00:03:55.959> in<00:03:56.410> maybe<00:03:56.620> or<00:03:57.099> a

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
people would be interested in maybe or a

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.479 
people would be interested in maybe or a
couple<00:03:57.730> of<00:03:57.819> the<00:03:58.620> sizes<00:03:59.620> for<00:03:59.950> the<00:03:59.980> fixed<00:04:00.280> place

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
couple of the sizes for the fixed place

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.000 
couple of the sizes for the fixed place
which<00:04:00.730> is<00:04:00.760> normally<00:04:01.360> t10<00:04:01.900> this<00:04:02.260> is<00:04:02.349> only<00:04:02.470> t6

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
which is normally t10 this is only t6

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.250 
which is normally t10 this is only t6
for<00:04:03.250> the<00:04:03.310> folders<00:04:03.670> so<00:04:04.390> maybe<00:04:04.690> I'll<00:04:04.870> get<00:04:05.050> the

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
for the folders so maybe I'll get the

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.290 
for the folders so maybe I'll get the
tea<00:04:05.500> pens<00:04:05.800> and<00:04:06.069> maybe<00:04:06.280> do<00:04:06.459> it<00:04:06.610> for<00:04:07.000> the<00:04:07.060> fixed

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
tea pens and maybe do it for the fixed

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.790 
tea pens and maybe do it for the fixed
plates<00:04:07.510> to<00:04:07.720> which<00:04:07.900> would<00:04:08.050> be<00:04:08.170> pretty<00:04:08.380> cool<00:04:08.440> as

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
plates to which would be pretty cool as

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.460 
plates to which would be pretty cool as
well<00:04:08.830> I<00:04:09.099> think<00:04:09.280> another<00:04:09.910> type<00:04:10.209> was<00:04:10.480> this<00:04:10.750> which

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
well I think another type was this which

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.440 
well I think another type was this which
i<00:04:11.680> think<00:04:11.739> i<00:04:11.950> can<00:04:12.010> make<00:04:12.220> work<00:04:12.550> if<00:04:12.819> i<00:04:12.910> even<00:04:13.180> snap

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
i think i can make work if i even snap

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.270 
i think i can make work if i even snap
it<00:04:13.569> off<00:04:13.660> you<00:04:13.840> like<00:04:13.989> you<00:04:14.319> know<00:04:14.410> cut<00:04:14.800> this<00:04:14.980> over

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
it off you like you know cut this over

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.009 
it off you like you know cut this over
probably<00:04:15.519> ground<00:04:15.880> it's<00:04:16.060> probably<00:04:16.419> the<00:04:16.540> most<00:04:16.900> i

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
probably ground it's probably the most i

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.810 
probably ground it's probably the most i
found<00:04:17.229> the<00:04:17.290> heaters<00:04:17.590> that<00:04:17.620> still<00:04:17.979> so<00:04:18.549> probably

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
found the heaters that still so probably

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.240 
found the heaters that still so probably
just<00:04:19.060> grind<00:04:19.299> it<00:04:19.389> off<00:04:19.540> so<00:04:20.019> it's<00:04:20.200> just<00:04:20.470> that<00:04:20.739> just

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
just grind it off so it's just that just

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.909 
just grind it off so it's just that just
it's<00:04:21.400> smaller<00:04:21.970> rod<00:04:22.270> which<00:04:22.570> is<00:04:22.690> also<00:04:22.960> looks

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
it's smaller rod which is also looks

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.379 
it's smaller rod which is also looks
like<00:04:24.100> the<00:04:24.220> same<00:04:24.400> diameter<00:04:24.729> which<00:04:25.180> should

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 
like the same diameter which should

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.500 
like the same diameter which should
snugly<00:04:26.050> fit<00:04:26.080> in<00:04:26.530> the<00:04:26.800> in<00:04:27.100> the<00:04:27.520> paracord<00:04:28.210> got<00:04:28.479> a

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
snugly fit in the in the paracord got a

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.590 
snugly fit in the in the paracord got a
paracord<00:04:28.960> and<00:04:30.000> even<00:04:31.000> with<00:04:31.210> the<00:04:31.330> small

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
paracord and even with the small

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.629 
paracord and even with the small
diameter<00:04:32.020> without<00:04:32.260> anything<00:04:32.590> any<00:04:32.889> L<00:04:33.100> shape<00:04:33.400> it

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 
diameter without anything any L shape it

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:34.860 
diameter without anything any L shape it
should<00:04:33.820> actually<00:04:33.940> still<00:04:34.389> give<00:04:34.630> enough

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
should actually still give enough

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.570 
should actually still give enough
purchase<00:04:35.320> especially<00:04:35.800> if<00:04:35.860> you<00:04:35.950> keep<00:04:36.220> it<00:04:36.370> in

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
purchase especially if you keep it in
