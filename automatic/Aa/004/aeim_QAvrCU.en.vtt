YouTube which is important of course we

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.729 
YouTube which is important of course we
want<00:00:34.210> to<00:00:34.330> create<00:00:34.600> a<00:00:34.660> space<00:00:35.019> to<00:00:35.290> display<00:00:35.530> our

want to create a space to display our
videos<00:00:36.370> in<00:00:36.879> a<00:00:37.059> more<00:00:37.269> organized<00:00:37.960> way<00:00:38.410> as<00:00:38.710> well

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
videos in a more organized way as well

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.810 
videos in a more organized way as well
as<00:00:39.699> show<00:00:39.970> them<00:00:40.600> in<00:00:40.809> a<00:00:40.870> more<00:00:41.110> businesslike

environment<00:00:43.110> when<00:00:44.110> we<00:00:44.290> made<00:00:44.500> our<00:00:44.739> first

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
environment when we made our first

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.689 
environment when we made our first
website<00:00:45.580> we<00:00:46.300> realized<00:00:46.960> how<00:00:47.290> complicated<00:00:47.699> the

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
website we realized how complicated the

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:52.170 
website we realized how complicated the
process<00:00:49.239> actually<00:00:49.629> is<00:00:50.400> but<00:00:51.400> we<00:00:51.729> are<00:00:51.909> glad<00:00:52.119> that

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
process actually is but we are glad that

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.439 
process actually is but we are glad that
these<00:00:52.600> times<00:00:52.900> are<00:00:53.049> over<00:00:53.260> because<00:00:53.920> wix<00:00:54.580> com<00:00:54.729> is

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
these times are over because wix com is

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:58.170 
these times are over because wix com is
a<00:00:55.510> great<00:00:55.839> solution<00:00:56.260> to<00:00:56.949> easily<00:00:57.400> build<00:00:57.670> your

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
a great solution to easily build your

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.660 
of building websites completely online
has<00:01:12.909> been<00:01:13.210> around<00:01:13.479> for<00:01:13.780> a<00:01:13.810> while<00:01:13.869> wix<00:01:14.799> com<00:01:14.950> is

has been around for a while wix com is
different<00:01:16.360> in<00:01:16.540> many<00:01:16.780> positives<00:01:17.409> ways<00:01:17.680> it<00:01:18.580> does

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
different in many positives ways it does

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:20.940 
different in many positives ways it does
not<00:01:19.119> only<00:01:19.540> let<00:01:19.689> you<00:01:19.840> choose<00:01:20.140> templates<00:01:20.710> and

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
not only let you choose templates and

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.700 
not only let you choose templates and
customize<00:01:21.880> the<00:01:22.120> content<00:01:22.300> but<00:01:23.230> actually

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
customize the content but actually

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.000 
customize the content but actually
really<00:01:24.280> lets<00:01:24.940> you<00:01:25.120> change<00:01:25.450> the<00:01:25.780> design

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
really lets you change the design

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.670 
really lets you change the design
towards<00:01:27.010> your<00:01:27.280> needs<00:01:27.670> by<00:01:28.660> that<00:01:28.810> I<00:01:28.870> mean<00:01:28.990> that

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
towards your needs by that I mean that

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.950 
towards your needs by that I mean that
it<00:01:29.830> is<00:01:29.950> actually<00:01:30.220> possible<00:01:30.430> to<00:01:31.060> change<00:01:31.540> the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
it is actually possible to change the

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.830 
it is actually possible to change the
position<00:01:32.470> of<00:01:32.590> elements<00:01:33.159> like<00:01:33.700> the<00:01:33.880> menu<00:01:34.300> your

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
position of elements like the menu your

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.830 
position of elements like the menu your
logo<00:01:35.290> or<00:01:35.500> space<00:01:36.159> between<00:01:36.670> the<00:01:36.909> header<00:01:37.090> and<00:01:37.360> the

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
logo or space between the header and the

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.860 
logo or space between the header and the
main<00:01:38.050> part<00:01:38.380> of<00:01:38.560> the<00:01:38.740> website<00:01:39.659> moving<00:01:40.659> those

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
main part of the website moving those

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.950 
main part of the website moving those
elements<00:01:41.290> is<00:01:41.680> a<00:01:41.710> really<00:01:42.670> complicated<00:01:43.060> process

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
elements is a really complicated process

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.530 
elements is a really complicated process
in<00:01:44.110> programming<00:01:44.830> but<00:01:45.460> very<00:01:45.790> much<00:01:46.030> simplified

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
in programming but very much simplified

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.500 
in programming but very much simplified
here<00:01:47.200> and<00:01:47.380> that's<00:01:47.920> one<00:01:48.190> of<00:01:48.310> the<00:01:48.520> reasons<00:01:48.940> why<00:01:49.479> I

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
here and that's one of the reasons why I

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.750 
here and that's one of the reasons why I
find<00:01:50.110> it<00:01:50.260> really<00:01:50.440> great<00:01:50.800> to<00:01:51.250> work<00:01:51.400> with<00:01:51.460> the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
find it really great to work with the

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.800 
find it really great to work with the
Wix<00:01:52.409> but<00:01:53.409> besides<00:01:54.070> that<00:01:54.250> my<00:01:54.940> highlights<00:01:55.450> with

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
Wix but besides that my highlights with

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.760 
Wix but besides that my highlights with
Wix<00:01:56.050> are<00:01:56.320> their<00:01:57.040> themes<00:01:57.460> for<00:01:57.909> filmmakers

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
Wix are their themes for filmmakers

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.060 
Wix are their themes for filmmakers
whichever<00:01:59.770> solution<00:02:00.490> i<00:02:00.610> have<00:02:00.820> used<00:02:01.120> so<00:02:01.390> far<00:02:01.690> i

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
whichever solution i have used so far i

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.830 
whichever solution i have used so far i
always<00:02:03.070> found<00:02:03.430> it<00:02:03.640> kind<00:02:03.670> of<00:02:04.030> difficult<00:02:04.360> to

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
always found it kind of difficult to

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.770 
always found it kind of difficult to
find<00:02:05.140> template<00:02:05.710> that<00:02:06.250> feature<00:02:06.610> videos<00:02:07.330> in<00:02:07.659> an

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
efficient way by that i mean that the

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.289 
efficient way by that i mean that the
videos<00:02:10.959> can<00:02:11.530> be<00:02:11.560> easily<00:02:11.890> integrated<00:02:12.400> on<00:02:13.209> the
