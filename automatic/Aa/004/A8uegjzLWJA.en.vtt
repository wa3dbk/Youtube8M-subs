00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.780
 The C line from Nokia which focuses on communication from British Gerard 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:11.590
 extend a few months ago we were still with the c6 an extendable 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:12.659
 QWERTY keyboard 

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:16.029
 and now the cities have the keyboard under the screen 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.160
 I was pleasantly surprised with the Nokia C3 out of the box, it looks nice 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.349
 they are adjusted 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.519
 It looks a bit like the Nokia E72, one of the better not yet devices 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:29.640
 yes without having looked at the specifications with which expectations are high 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.190
 I can gradually go back a bit, but the C3 really does 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.250
 the devices 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.150
 The biggest advantage of the Nokia C3 is the keyboard under two commotion 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.870
 screen 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.550
 pukkelpop is very nice to print on, you can really really 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.970
 easy to control the s 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.200
 further noticeable is that on the side and may I be with other phones 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.480
 do you have it then it might be that this flag also promote to volume 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.880
 adaptable to music 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.980
 where is just really nothing at all the control is only via the keyboard 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.440
 below the screen 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.390
 in that respect it is three more with the connection 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.829
 and you also control the camera with the keyboard that is under the screen 

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:08.259
 but do not expect too much from the pictures that the cd has with 2 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:09.760
 megapixel camera 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.020
 and especially in the dark, the photos are very moderate. Twente is also missing 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.660
 flash in daylight is still possible but that is not really a success of the 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.570
 to call the c series of nokia focuses on communicating hence also that sea 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.820
 also adjusted during the screen 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.780
 in the market you focus on the latest updates from for example at communities 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.930
 parties come in normally says emphatically 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.910
 to us we got it now so not talking or maybe the software can 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.280
 fÃ¼hrer we do not know but there were more people on the internet with the same 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.310
 problem without the housing exchange time this year we could also hold the c3 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.980
 then it was pretty nice 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.090
 for life you are on vtm or just surfing is only possible 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.220
 use GPS because the phone does not support 3G and that 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.210
 is a pity what is striking is that there is WiFi again 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.040
 has support that you can use the internet for that delay 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.380
 The lack of 3G is one of the points to make this phone just something 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.870
 cheaper to make a dog also no GPS 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.660
 which comes down to the fact that he may or may not be able to wear a little less than one euro 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.420
 price tag 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.429
 he actually presents everything on board that you like from a solid button 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.880
 device one can use a budget application and customize games and it 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.540
 solid agenda mp3 player and in addition, it is also in different colors 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.830
 available as this ball behind the peppers is ever to describe 

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:23.399
 and also to love all ours 

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:27.579
 a little more than 100 euros costs is certainly not so then you get no GPS and and 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:29.619
 no 3g but who finds 

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:33.339
 and an excellent keyboard it is the tradeoff to make but we find the 

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.939
 right choice
