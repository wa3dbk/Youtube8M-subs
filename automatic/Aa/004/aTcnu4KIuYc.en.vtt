York<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.890> San<00:00:59.010> Francisco<00:00:59.070> where<00:00:59.609> there<00:00:59.789> have

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
York and San Francisco where there have

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.029 
York and San Francisco where there have
been<00:01:00.270> problems<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.930> past<00:01:01.140> however<00:01:01.680> there

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
been problems in the past however there

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.509 
been problems in the past however there
is<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.640> verizon<00:01:03.570> cdma<00:01:03.860> limitation<00:01:04.860> where<00:01:05.369> you

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
is the verizon cdma limitation where you

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.910 
is the verizon cdma limitation where you
can<00:01:05.700> only<00:01:05.909> use<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.900> internet<00:01:07.500> if<00:01:07.650> you're<00:01:07.770> not

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
can only use the internet if you're not

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.980 
can only use the internet if you're not
on<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.130> phone<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:08.909> that's<00:01:09.090> some<00:01:09.390> limitation

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
on the phone so that's some limitation

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.929 
on the phone so that's some limitation
however<00:01:10.170> i<00:01:10.470> think<00:01:10.890> it's<00:01:11.340> not<00:01:11.580> really<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.820> big

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
however i think it's not really that big

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:12.920 
however i think it's not really that big
a<00:01:12.000> deal<00:01:12.119> because<00:01:12.270> i<00:01:12.540> don't<00:01:12.689> know<00:01:12.720> how<00:01:12.840> many

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
a deal because i don't know how many

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.480 
a deal because i don't know how many
people<00:01:13.290> actually<00:01:13.470> go<00:01:13.860> on<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.010> internet<00:01:14.130> while

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
people actually go on the internet while

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.370 
people actually go on the internet while
they're<00:01:14.700> on<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.909> phone<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.479> if<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.840> are<00:01:16.020> i'm

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380

they're on the phone and if you are i'm
sorry<00:01:16.710> you're<00:01:17.100> one<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.430> few<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.880> maybe<00:01:17.909> you

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
sorry you're one of a few and maybe you

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.960 
sorry you're one of a few and maybe you
should<00:01:18.630> stick<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.930> AT&amp;T<00:01:19.229> however<00:01:19.890> if<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.790> are

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
should stick to AT&amp;T however if you are

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.760 
should stick to AT&amp;T however if you are
looking<00:01:21.119> for<00:01:21.270> overall<00:01:21.630> better<00:01:21.930> service<00:01:22.409> even

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
looking for overall better service even

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.050 
looking for overall better service even
it<00:01:22.860> even<00:01:23.130> though<00:01:23.220> it's<00:01:23.369> at<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.520> slightly<00:01:23.909> lower

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
it even though it's at a slightly lower

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.940 
it even though it's at a slightly lower
speed<00:01:24.689> i<00:01:24.900> would<00:01:25.229> definitely<00:01:25.500> go<00:01:25.740> with<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
speed i would definitely go with the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.160 
speed i would definitely go with the
verizon<00:01:26.490> because<00:01:26.909> it's<00:01:27.570> just<00:01:27.780> overall<00:01:28.140> a

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
verizon because it's just overall a

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.170 
verizon because it's just overall a
little<00:01:28.530> more<00:01:28.680> steady<00:01:28.979> so<00:01:29.520> this<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.850> course<00:01:29.880> is

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
little more steady so this of course is

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.789 
little more steady so this of course is
only<00:01:30.360> with<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.600> few<00:01:30.900> iphones<00:01:31.140> on<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.650> network

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
only with a few iphones on the network

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.679 
only with a few iphones on the network
as<00:01:32.159> most<00:01:32.640> people<00:01:32.939> haven't<00:01:33.240> received<00:01:33.509> them<00:01:33.630> yet

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
as most people haven't received them yet

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.330 
as most people haven't received them yet
so<00:01:33.990> i<00:01:34.259> have<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.560> see<00:01:34.710> what<00:01:34.860> happens<00:01:34.890> in<00:01:35.250> the

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
so i have to see what happens in the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.880 
so i have to see what happens in the
future<00:01:35.490> if<00:01:35.790> they<00:01:35.939> can<00:01:36.119> hold<00:01:36.299> up<00:01:36.540> or<00:01:37.170> if<00:01:37.740> they're

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
future if they can hold up or if they're

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.950 
future if they can hold up or if they're
