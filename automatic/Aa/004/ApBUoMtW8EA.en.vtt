00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
actually figure out probably because

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.210 
actually figure out probably because
well<00:04:40.030> first<00:04:40.210> of<00:04:40.390> all<00:04:40.420> they're<00:04:40.570> not<00:04:40.600> human

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
that's a good point to make

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.560 
that's a good point to make
second<00:04:43.720> of<00:04:43.810> all<00:04:43.900> their<00:04:44.470> faces<00:04:44.710> a

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
second of all their faces a

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.290 
second of all their faces a
disproportional<00:04:46.570> -<00:04:46.900> what<00:04:47.500> how<00:04:48.190> old<00:04:48.220> on<00:04:48.760> it<00:04:49.030> can

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
disproportional - what how old on it can

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.780 
disproportional - what how old on it can
specify<00:04:49.810> as<00:04:50.230> a<00:04:50.260> human<00:04:50.800> of<00:04:50.920> course<00:04:51.430> this<00:04:51.580> is<00:04:51.760> a

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
specify as a human of course this is a

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.730 
specify as a human of course this is a
relatively<00:04:52.270> new<00:04:52.390> website<00:04:53.110> so<00:04:53.350> they<00:04:53.530> might

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
relatively new website so they might

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.980 
relatively new website so they might
improve<00:04:54.100> it<00:04:54.310> later<00:04:54.550> on<00:04:54.670> so<00:04:54.970> maybe<00:04:55.180> you<00:04:55.660> know<00:04:55.780> as

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
improve it later on so maybe you know as

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.370 
improve it later on so maybe you know as
the<00:04:56.410> website<00:04:57.190> gets<00:04:57.400> worked<00:04:57.610> on<00:04:57.790> or<00:04:58.000> the<00:04:58.380> system

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
the website gets worked on or the system

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
behind it gets worked on they might be

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.210 
behind it gets worked on they might be
