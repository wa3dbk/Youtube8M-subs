00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
that's just an odd number like I mean I

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.020 
that's just an odd number like I mean I
know<00:02:30.740> it's<00:02:30.950> an<00:02:31.040> even<00:02:31.400> number<00:02:31.670> but<00:02:31.790> it's<00:02:31.910> like<00:02:32.000> a

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
know it's an even number but it's like a

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.300 
know it's an even number but it's like a
strange<00:02:32.450> number<00:02:32.720> to<00:02:32.990> have<00:02:33.200> I<00:02:33.620> don't<00:02:34.100> know<00:02:34.190> why

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
strange number to have I don't know why

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.860 
strange number to have I don't know why
they<00:02:34.430> wouldn't<00:02:34.580> do<00:02:34.730> like<00:02:34.880> 20<00:02:35.390> I<00:02:35.420> mean<00:02:35.660> yes

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
they wouldn't do like 20 I mean yes

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.060 
they wouldn't do like 20 I mean yes
maybe<00:02:36.200> you're<00:02:36.320> not<00:02:36.410> gonna<00:02:36.500> put<00:02:36.709> on<00:02:36.830> every

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
maybe you're not gonna put on every

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.260 
maybe you're not gonna put on every
single<00:02:37.190> on<00:02:37.370> your<00:02:37.520> nails<00:02:37.730> maybe<00:02:38.000> you're<00:02:38.150> just

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
single on your nails maybe you're just

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.610 
single on your nails maybe you're just
like<00:02:38.450> me<00:02:38.600> and<00:02:38.630> you<00:02:38.780> want<00:02:38.870> to<00:02:39.020> put<00:02:39.140> it<00:02:39.230> on<00:02:39.290> a<00:02:39.320> few

like me and you want to put it on a few

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.410 
like me and you want to put it on a few
but<00:02:40.100> I<00:02:40.130> think<00:02:40.280> would<00:02:40.340> be<00:02:40.490> nice<00:02:40.670> to<00:02:40.910> have<00:02:41.030> 20

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
but I think would be nice to have 20

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.080 
but I think would be nice to have 20
altogether<00:02:42.490> so<00:02:43.490> I'm<00:02:43.580> just<00:02:43.670> going<00:02:43.790> to<00:02:43.850> try<00:02:44.060> and

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
altogether so I'm just going to try and

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
altogether so I'm just going to try and
measure<00:02:45.010> one<00:02:46.010> for<00:02:46.340> my<00:02:46.459> hand<00:02:46.810> you<00:02:47.810> want<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:47.990> get

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
measure one for my hand you want to get

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.050 
measure one for my hand you want to get
as<00:02:48.200> close<00:02:48.380> as<00:02:48.500> you<00:02:48.740> can<00:02:49.070> obviously<00:02:49.760> you<00:02:49.880> can

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
as close as you can obviously you can

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.250 
as close as you can obviously you can
adjust<00:02:50.570> the<00:02:51.170> sizes<00:02:51.800> but<00:02:52.130> on<00:02:52.989> like<00:02:53.989> this<00:02:54.110> one

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
adjust the sizes but on like this one

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.020 
adjust the sizes but on like this one
looks<00:02:54.440> pretty<00:02:54.500> close<00:02:55.070> it's<00:02:55.489> hard<00:02:55.670> to<00:02:55.730> show

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
looks pretty close it's hard to show

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.640 
looks pretty close it's hard to show
because<00:02:56.360> I<00:02:56.390> mean<00:02:56.540> I<00:02:56.570> have<00:02:56.690> to<00:02:56.720> lay<00:02:56.930> it<00:02:56.989> flat<00:02:57.230> but

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
because I mean I have to lay it flat but

peeling off the clear part there's no
texture<00:03:15.890> to<00:03:16.100> this<00:03:16.280> like<00:03:16.970> it's<00:03:17.150> very<00:03:17.480> smooth<00:03:18.050> I

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
texture to this like it's very smooth I

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.020 
texture to this like it's very smooth I
was<00:03:18.800> worried<00:03:19.070> you<00:03:19.130> were<00:03:19.220> going<00:03:19.310> to<00:03:19.370> feel<00:03:19.790> the

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
was worried you were going to feel the

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.090 
was worried you were going to feel the
glitter<00:03:20.330> grains<00:03:20.720> but<00:03:21.080> not<00:03:21.290> at<00:03:21.470> all<00:03:21.620> it's<00:03:21.860> very

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
glitter grains but not at all it's very

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.060 
glitter grains but not at all it's very
smooth<00:03:22.459> and<00:03:22.640> nice<00:03:23.350> I'm<00:03:24.350> very<00:03:24.410> surprised<00:03:24.920> about

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
smooth and nice I'm very surprised about

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.170 
smooth and nice I'm very surprised about
that<00:03:25.190> actually<00:03:25.489> I<00:03:25.670> thought<00:03:25.820> it<00:03:25.940> was<00:03:26.000> going<00:03:26.120> to

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
that actually I thought it was going to

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.410 
that actually I thought it was going to
be<00:03:26.269> textured<00:03:26.630> I'm<00:03:26.989> glad<00:03:27.260> it's<00:03:27.440> not<00:03:27.500> though<00:03:27.860> and

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
be textured I'm glad it's not though and

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.820 
be textured I'm glad it's not though and
now<00:03:29.420> you're<00:03:29.660> going<00:03:29.780> to<00:03:29.840> break<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:32.060> strip<00:03:32.450> off

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
now you're going to break the strip off

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:40.240 
now you're going to break the strip off
and<00:03:34.209> now<00:03:35.209> peel<00:03:35.720> this<00:03:35.959> piece<00:03:36.350> up<00:03:39.040> okay<00:03:40.040> maybe

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
and now peel this piece up okay maybe

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.250 
and now peel this piece up okay maybe
they<00:03:40.760> tell<00:03:40.940> you<00:03:41.030> to<00:03:41.120> break<00:03:41.330> off<00:03:41.600> the<00:03:41.959> strip

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
they tell you to break off the strip

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.259 
they tell you to break off the strip
first<00:03:42.560> that's<00:03:42.920> probably<00:03:43.519> not<00:03:43.940> the<00:03:44.000> smartest

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
first that's probably not the smartest

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:45.729 
first that's probably not the smartest
move<00:03:44.780> because<00:03:44.989> now<00:03:45.140> it's<00:03:45.260> really<00:03:45.440> hard<00:03:45.620> to

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
move because now it's really hard to

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.370 
move because now it's really hard to
remove<00:03:46.040> the<00:03:46.190> back<00:03:46.459> strip<00:03:46.930> like<00:03:47.930> this<00:03:47.959> white

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
remove the back strip like this white

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.170 
remove the back strip like this white
part<00:03:49.930> okay<00:03:50.930> but<00:03:51.200> I<00:03:51.230> got<00:03:51.440> it<00:03:51.590> off<00:03:52.060> now<00:03:53.060> I'm<00:03:53.120> just

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
part okay but I got it off now I'm just

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.039 
part okay but I got it off now I'm just
gonna<00:03:53.330> lay<00:03:53.510> flat<00:03:55.060> starting<00:03:56.060> on<00:03:56.180> one<00:03:56.450> side<00:03:56.810> and

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
gonna lay flat starting on one side and

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.360 
gonna lay flat starting on one side and
getting<00:03:57.260> it<00:03:57.350> as<00:03:57.470> close<00:03:57.769> as<00:03:57.950> possible

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:07.030 

so<00:04:04.240> lay<00:04:05.240> it<00:04:05.270> down<00:04:05.569> and<00:04:06.470> leave<00:04:06.650> my<00:04:06.830> down<00:04:07.010> a

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
so lay it down and leave my down a

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.220 
so lay it down and leave my down a
little<00:04:07.280> crooked<00:04:07.610> as<00:04:08.000> you<00:04:08.420> can<00:04:08.569> tell<00:04:08.840> but<00:04:09.110> it

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
little crooked as you can tell but it

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.199 
little crooked as you can tell but it
covers<00:04:09.440> the<00:04:09.709> nail<00:04:09.890> nicely<00:04:10.370> this<00:04:10.490> way<00:04:10.670> it<00:04:10.970> says

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
covers the nail nicely this way it says

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.870 
covers the nail nicely this way it says
to<00:04:11.480> file<00:04:11.870> and<00:04:12.170> shape<00:04:12.530> it<00:04:12.800> I<00:04:13.100> wonder<00:04:13.640> if<00:04:13.700> you<00:04:13.760> can

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
to file and shape it I wonder if you can

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.640 
to file and shape it I wonder if you can
even<00:04:14.000> shave<00:04:14.330> it<00:04:14.510> with<00:04:14.630> this<00:04:14.900> then<00:04:15.319> like<00:04:15.530> the

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
even shave it with this then like the

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:23.470 
even shave it with this then like the
cuticle<00:04:17.139> piece<00:04:18.139> of<00:04:18.320> wood<00:04:21.520> let's<00:04:22.520> it<00:04:23.150> clear<00:04:23.450> a

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
cuticle piece of wood let's it clear a

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:31.290 
cuticle piece of wood let's it clear a
little<00:04:23.660> spot<00:04:23.960> let's<00:04:24.290> see<00:04:24.470> what<00:04:24.620> we<00:04:24.740> can<00:04:24.889> do

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.790 

yeah<00:04:32.300> it<00:04:32.480> breaks<00:04:32.750> very<00:04:33.050> easily<00:04:33.200> and<00:04:33.650> I

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
yeah it breaks very easily and I

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.640 
yeah it breaks very easily and I
actually<00:04:33.980> like<00:04:34.220> to<00:04:34.750> use<00:04:35.750> this<00:04:36.020> this<00:04:36.260> is<00:04:36.410> very

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
actually like to use this this is very

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:45.670 
actually like to use this this is very
nice<00:04:38.169> okay<00:04:39.220> so<00:04:40.220> that's<00:04:40.370> the<00:04:40.580> nail

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.380 

so<00:04:46.680> you<00:04:46.740> see<00:04:46.920> how<00:04:46.980> there's<00:04:47.240> three<00:04:48.240> layers<00:04:48.510> here

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
so you see how there's three layers here

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.390 
so you see how there's three layers here
so<00:04:51.390> you<00:04:51.480> see<00:04:51.690> the<00:04:51.810> three<00:04:52.020> layers<00:04:52.230> I'm<00:04:53.100> going<00:04:53.340> to

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
so you see the three layers I'm going to

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.340 
so you see the three layers I'm going to
peel<00:04:53.760> off<00:04:53.790> the<00:04:53.940> white<00:04:54.360> layer<00:04:54.690> first<00:04:55.050> because

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
peel off the white layer first because

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.200 
peel off the white layer first because
that<00:04:55.440> was<00:04:55.560> really<00:04:55.920> hard<00:04:56.250> to<00:04:56.370> pick<00:04:56.640> off<00:04:56.850> and

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
that was really hard to pick off and

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.600 
that was really hard to pick off and
then<00:04:57.900> I<00:04:57.930> mean<00:04:58.230> then<00:04:58.380> you<00:04:58.470> can<00:04:58.620> peel<00:04:58.830> the<00:04:59.340> top

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
then I mean then you can peel the top

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.300 
then I mean then you can peel the top
layer<00:04:59.880> if<00:05:00.030> you<00:05:00.120> want<00:05:00.620> and<00:05:01.620> I'm<00:05:01.950> going<00:05:02.070> to<00:05:02.160> place

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
layer if you want and I'm going to place

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:09.110 
layer if you want and I'm going to place
it<00:05:02.340> on<00:05:02.550> my<00:05:02.610> now<00:05:04.820> start<00:05:07.700> putting<00:05:08.700> in<00:05:08.820> like<00:05:08.970> the

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
it on my now start putting in like the

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.630 
it on my now start putting in like the
back<00:05:09.330> corner<00:05:11.600> and<00:05:12.600> then<00:05:13.200> laying<00:05:13.770> it<00:05:14.070> flat<00:05:14.250> it's

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
back corner and then laying it flat it's

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.880 
back corner and then laying it flat it's
very<00:05:15.090> simple<00:05:15.450> and<00:05:15.630> it's<00:05:15.990> easy<00:05:16.170> to<00:05:16.380> remove<00:05:16.680> like

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
very simple and it's easy to remove like

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.380 
very simple and it's easy to remove like
if<00:05:17.010> you<00:05:17.100> need<00:05:17.310> to<00:05:17.430> take<00:05:17.550> it<00:05:17.610> off<00:05:17.820> and<00:05:17.850> reapply

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
if you need to take it off and reapply

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:23.540 
if you need to take it off and reapply
it<00:05:18.450> on<00:05:20.300> okay<00:05:21.300> I'm<00:05:22.140> really<00:05:22.470> applying<00:05:23.190> pressure

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
it on okay I'm really applying pressure

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:24.920 
it on okay I'm really applying pressure
and<00:05:23.910> pushing<00:05:24.240> it<00:05:24.330> down<00:05:24.420> making<00:05:24.660> sure<00:05:24.720> it's

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
and pushing it down making sure it's
