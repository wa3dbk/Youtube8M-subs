00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.920 
or an eight if it's a 10 you're going a
bit<00:01:53.430> too<00:01:53.490> far<00:01:53.880> we<00:01:54.149> don't<00:01:54.180> want<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.450> injure<00:01:54.840> the

progression out of it so we've got to be

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.380 
progression out of it so we've got to be
a<00:01:59.250> bit<00:01:59.430> gentle

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
one more full range of motion so out to

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.710 
one more full range of motion so out to
the<00:02:13.720> side<00:02:13.930> with<00:02:14.110> a<00:02:14.140> tow<00:02:14.430> twice<00:02:15.430> in<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.330> center

all the way down full range of motion I

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.900 
all the way down full range of motion I
should<00:02:59.380> really<00:02:59.680> feel<00:02:59.890> the<00:03:00.040> peak<00:03:00.280> here<00:03:00.730> and

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.970 
you got more juice in it in you than I
do<00:03:22.140> but<00:03:23.140> you<00:03:23.230> don't<00:03:23.350> need<00:03:23.440> anything<00:03:23.650> more<00:03:23.860> than

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
do but you don't need anything more than

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.890 
do but you don't need anything more than
20<00:03:24.280> i<00:03:24.310> would<00:03:24.519> say<00:03:26.220> okay<00:03:27.220> good<00:03:27.940> then<00:03:28.750> we're

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
20 i would say okay good then we're

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.110 
20 i would say okay good then we're
going<00:03:28.989> to<00:03:29.049> actually<00:03:29.230> train<00:03:29.769> the<00:03:30.010> split<00:03:30.340> so<00:03:31.000> the

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
going to actually train the split so the

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.360 
going to actually train the split so the
only<00:03:31.269> way<00:03:31.690> to<00:03:31.750> really<00:03:32.200> get<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:32.709> splits<00:03:32.980> going

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
only way to really get the splits going

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.370 
only way to really get the splits going
is<00:03:33.519> if<00:03:33.640> we're<00:03:33.790> in<00:03:33.880> a<00:03:34.000> split<00:03:34.269> position<00:03:34.420> so<00:03:35.290> we're

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
is if we're in a split position so we're

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.890 
is if we're in a split position so we're
going<00:03:35.470> to<00:03:35.560> get<00:03:35.739> as<00:03:35.980> low<00:03:36.579> as<00:03:36.700> you<00:03:36.790> can<00:03:36.970> so<00:03:37.209> doing

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
going to get as low as you can so doing

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.080 
going to get as low as you can so doing
this<00:03:38.079> might<00:03:38.380> be<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:39.070> extent<00:03:39.370> for<00:03:39.640> you<00:03:39.730> and<00:03:39.940> all

you<00:04:41.470> but<00:04:41.650> it's<00:04:41.800> a<00:04:41.830> cool<00:04:42.070> thing<00:04:42.100> to<00:04:42.340> be<00:04:42.490> able<00:04:42.550> to

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
you but it's a cool thing to be able to

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.580 
you but it's a cool thing to be able to
get<00:04:42.850> those<00:04:43.060> hips<00:04:43.270> open<00:04:43.810> be<00:04:44.229> able<00:04:44.380> to<00:04:44.440> get<00:04:44.530> the

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
get those hips open be able to get the

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.730 
get those hips open be able to get the
hamstring<00:04:45.160> nice<00:04:45.400> and<00:04:45.850> loose<00:04:46.210> as<00:04:46.389> well<00:04:46.570> and<00:04:46.840> the

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
hamstring nice and loose as well and the

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.500 
hamstring nice and loose as well and the
thing<00:04:47.919> is<00:04:47.949> too<00:04:48.280> is<00:04:48.430> that<00:04:48.610> one<00:04:48.940> side<00:04:49.150> is<00:04:49.180> always

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
thing is too is that one side is always

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.400 
thing is too is that one side is always
going<00:04:49.600> to<00:04:49.690> be<00:04:49.720> a<00:04:49.780> little<00:04:49.840> bit<00:04:49.960> tighter<00:04:50.199> than

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
going to be a little bit tighter than

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.409 
going to be a little bit tighter than
the<00:04:50.470> other<00:04:50.800> so<00:04:51.490> for<00:04:51.729> me<00:04:51.820> this<00:04:51.970> is<00:04:52.120> a<00:04:52.150> tighter

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
the other so for me this is a tighter

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.060 
the other so for me this is a tighter
side<00:04:52.690> it's<00:04:52.960> much<00:04:53.139> easier<00:04:53.169> for<00:04:53.590> me<00:04:53.680> this<00:04:53.830> what's

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
side it's much easier for me this what's

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.310 
side it's much easier for me this what's
on<00:04:54.160> the<00:04:54.220> other<00:04:54.280> side<00:04:54.430> but<00:04:55.210> being<00:04:55.419> a<00:04:55.690> balanced
