to use tail rotor thrust depending on
the<00:01:12.360> altitude<00:01:13.200> okay<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:13.890> let's<00:01:14.250> say<00:01:14.399> Bogota<00:01:14.940> 30

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
the altitude okay so let's say Bogota 30

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.300 
the altitude okay so let's say Bogota 30
degrees<00:01:16.110> c<00:01:17.330> 5,000<00:01:18.330> feet<00:01:18.509> or<00:01:18.780> 6,000<00:01:19.470> feet<00:01:19.680> maybe

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
degrees c 5,000 feet or 6,000 feet maybe

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.330 
degrees c 5,000 feet or 6,000 feet maybe
6,000<00:01:22.100> 08<00:01:23.100> okay<00:01:23.670> 8,000<00:01:24.570> feet<00:01:24.950> it's<00:01:25.950> saying

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
6,000 08 okay 8,000 feet it's saying

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.850 
6,000 08 okay 8,000 feet it's saying
that<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:27.119> aircraft<00:01:27.300> without<00:01:27.959> the<00:01:28.349> fast<00:01:28.619> in

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
that the aircraft without the fast in

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.589 
that the aircraft without the fast in
can<00:01:29.789> carry<00:01:30.060> about<00:01:30.679> 9,200<00:01:31.679> pounds<00:01:32.160> and<00:01:32.759> with

00:01:33.589 --> 00:01:33.599 
can carry about 9,200 pounds and with

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:36.620 
can carry about 9,200 pounds and with
the<00:01:33.840> fasted<00:01:34.410> and<00:01:34.619> carry<00:01:35.459> about<00:01:35.670> ten<00:01:36.000> thousand

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
the fasted and carry about ten thousand

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.529 
the fasted and carry about ten thousand
four<00:01:36.899> hundred<00:01:36.929> pounds<00:01:37.649> so<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.700> difference<00:01:38.970> of

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
four hundred pounds so the difference of

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:43.820 
four hundred pounds so the difference of
course<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:40.009> 1200<00:01:41.009> pounds<00:01:41.840> that's<00:01:42.840> also<00:01:43.470> about

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
course is 1200 pounds that's also about

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.029 
course is 1200 pounds that's also about
ninety<00:01:44.459> percent<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:45.179> the<00:01:45.990> total<00:01:46.229> useful<00:01:46.860> load
