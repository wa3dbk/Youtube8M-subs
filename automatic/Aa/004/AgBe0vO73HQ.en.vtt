I go by Bob x my real names Robert
Boyardee<00:00:12.090> and<00:00:13.309> I've<00:00:14.309> been<00:00:14.520> Bob<00:00:14.730> X<00:00:15.000> since<00:00:15.389> about

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:15.629

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
nineteen eighty-two I like the X part

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.270 
nineteen eighty-two I like the X part
because<00:00:23.490> X<00:00:23.820> in<00:00:24.090> mathematics<00:00:25.160> represents<00:00:26.160> the

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:26.280 
because X in mathematics represents the

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.360 
because X in mathematics represents the
unknown<00:00:26.810> so<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:27.840> thought<00:00:28.260> maybe<00:00:28.320> if<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:28.920> created

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:29.370 
unknown so I thought maybe if I created

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.580 
unknown so I thought maybe if I created
a<00:00:29.580> little<00:00:30.030> mystique<00:00:30.480> around<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.960> name<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.440> may

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
a little mystique around the name it may

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.810 
a little mystique around the name it may
create<00:00:31.800> interest<00:00:32.340> in<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.640> art<00:00:34.520> when<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.550> was
