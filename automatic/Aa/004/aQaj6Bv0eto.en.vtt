00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:06.600
 when he took office 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.509
 find site in the hague 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:11.089
 finally and pip dog wash 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:14.869
 inspiration for that comes a part in the books of antiquities seen and heard 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:19.759
 a good friends time of his customers in the laundry opening along with one 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:22.900
 of the largest 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.090
 very great britain 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.089
 everyone can not even find themselves 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:30.089
 and that 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.260
 I keep all options 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.840
 they clearly got the black three-year election chairman 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.580
 nothing that so many people point to the opening of wall street 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.120
 not this year so be ready 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.120
 after an employee and a security guard 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.740
 gerard 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.020
 and then the big moment there DJ may be the first round I have in the Netherlands 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.020
 try out the ones mentioned on rotterdammers 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.600
 to hold 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:16.800
 he was 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.360
 Amsterdam 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.360
 cameraman arrested 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.590
 not crazy for a state 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.740
 after the Friday prayer 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.360
 he laid body 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.159
 via email 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.890
 because I think it is very special that they can still count with the 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.320
 dog of her good friend guusje nederhorst 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.320
 the new ones 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.920
 my way more 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.720
 in one year 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.560
 years ago 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.129
 this first anniversary this booklet was published in 2005 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:12.989
 four more woezel and pip clothing booklets followed their theater show 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.609
 cartoons and now also dog laundry 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:19.579
 what will be the next step to let a lot of sunburn amusement parks go 

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:25.389
 the married couple 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:28.379
