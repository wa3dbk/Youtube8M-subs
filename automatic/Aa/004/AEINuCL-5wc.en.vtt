and one other thing your DNA determines

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.230 
and one other thing your DNA determines
is<00:01:00.140> your<00:01:00.410> height<00:01:00.650> and<00:01:00.860> here's<00:01:01.610> the<00:01:01.970> height

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:02.240 
is your height and here's the height

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.350

gene<00:01:02.690> an<00:01:03.100> organism<00:01:04.100> is<00:01:04.220> genetically<00:01:04.699> modified

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
gene an organism is genetically modified

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.990 
gene an organism is genetically modified

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
when its genes have been changed there's

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.870 
when its genes have been changed there's
also<00:01:08.360> a<00:01:08.600> gene<00:01:08.990> in<00:01:09.170> a<00:01:09.260> DNA<00:01:09.710> that<00:01:10.010> makes<00:01:10.160> insulin

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
also a gene in a DNA that makes insulin

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.220

insulin<00:01:11.570> is<00:01:11.870> what<00:01:12.140> Prime<00:01:12.920> needs<00:01:13.390> so<00:01:14.390> to<00:01:14.990> get

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.230 
insulin is what Prime needs so to get

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.710 
insulin is what Prime needs so to get
this<00:01:15.500> gene<00:01:15.860> we<00:01:16.250> use<00:01:16.370> restriction<00:01:17.060> enzymes<00:01:17.510> to

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
this gene we use restriction enzymes to

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.520 
this gene we use restriction enzymes to
cut<00:01:17.900> it<00:01:18.080> out

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
cut it out

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.680 
cut it out
if<00:01:18.590> striction<00:01:19.550> enzymes<00:01:20.000> are<00:01:20.180> like<00:01:20.360> scissors

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
if striction enzymes are like scissors

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.149 
if striction enzymes are like scissors
they<00:01:21.560> cut<00:01:21.800> your<00:01:21.950> day<00:01:22.220> at<00:01:22.610> certain<00:01:23.210> sections

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
they cut your day at certain sections

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.610 
they cut your day at certain sections
here<00:01:25.159> is<00:01:25.400> an<00:01:25.580> insulin<00:01:26.030> gene<00:01:26.240> this<00:01:26.930> is<00:01:27.230> a<00:01:27.260> cell

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
here is an insulin gene this is a cell

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.080 
here is an insulin gene this is a cell
of<00:01:27.860> bacteria<00:01:28.640> another<00:01:29.390> type<00:01:29.780> of<00:01:29.960> organism<00:01:30.620> in

of bacteria another type of organism in
bacteria<00:01:32.090> some<00:01:32.480> of<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:32.659> DNA<00:01:33.110> is<00:01:33.350> in<00:01:33.560> circles

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
bacteria some of the DNA is in circles

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.510 
bacteria some of the DNA is in circles
these<00:01:35.030> are<00:01:35.330> called<00:01:35.600> plasmids<00:01:36.409> and<00:01:36.740> we<00:01:37.100> can<00:01:37.340> use

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
these are called plasmids and we can use

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.899 
these are called plasmids and we can use
them<00:01:37.790> to<00:01:37.820> insert<00:01:38.390> a<00:01:38.420> gene<00:01:39.070> into<00:01:40.070> the<00:01:40.340> bacteria

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
them to insert a gene into the bacteria

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.680 
them to insert a gene into the bacteria
in<00:01:41.570> order<00:01:42.440> to<00:01:42.650> insert<00:01:43.040> the<00:01:43.100> insulin<00:01:43.909> gene<00:01:43.940> into

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
in order to insert the insulin gene into

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.530 
in order to insert the insulin gene into
the<00:01:44.930> plasmid<00:01:45.530> we<00:01:46.159> cut<00:01:46.580> the<00:01:46.790> plasma<00:01:47.300> through

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
the plasmid we cut the plasma through

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.670 
the plasmid we cut the plasma through
the<00:01:47.630> restriction<00:01:48.290> enzymes<00:01:48.740> or<00:01:49.070> the<00:01:49.520> scissors

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.730 

then<00:01:54.640> we<00:01:54.940> need<00:01:55.120> to<00:01:55.180> insert<00:01:55.810> the<00:01:55.870> insulin<00:01:56.560> gene

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
then we need to insert the insulin gene

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.120 
then we need to insert the insulin gene
into<00:01:57.220> the<00:01:57.340> plasmid<00:01:58.470> another<00:01:59.470> enzyme<00:02:00.070> called

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
into the plasmid another enzyme called

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.480 
into the plasmid another enzyme called
ligase<00:02:01.000> helps<00:02:01.600> us<00:02:01.900> to<00:02:02.140> do<00:02:02.290> this<00:02:02.500> ligase<00:02:03.310> is

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
ligase helps us to do this ligase is

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.430 
ligase helps us to do this ligase is
like<00:02:03.640> a<00:02:03.760> glue<00:02:04.000> stick<00:02:04.030> and<00:02:04.540> glues<00:02:04.960> the<00:02:05.170> end<00:02:05.350> of

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
like a glue stick and glues the end of

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:15.500 
like a glue stick and glues the end of
the<00:02:05.590> insulin<00:02:06.070> gene<00:02:06.100> to<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.730> plasma

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.540 

then<00:02:16.510> we<00:02:16.780> can<00:02:16.960> put<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.319> plasmid<00:02:18.100> with<00:02:18.370> the

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
then we can put the plasmid with the

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.600 
then we can put the plasmid with the
insulin<00:02:19.000> gene<00:02:19.060> back<00:02:19.630> into<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.200> bacteria<00:02:20.830> the

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
insulin gene back into the bacteria the

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.500 
insulin gene back into the bacteria the
bacteria<00:02:21.640> is<00:02:22.510> now<00:02:22.810> a<00:02:23.040> genetically<00:02:24.040> modified

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
bacteria is now a genetically modified

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.480 
bacteria is now a genetically modified
organism<00:02:25.510> because<00:02:26.260> it's<00:02:26.530> a<00:02:26.650> living<00:02:27.040> thing<00:02:27.310> and

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
organism because it's a living thing and

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.150 
organism because it's a living thing and
we<00:02:27.790> have<00:02:27.970> modified<00:02:28.510> or<00:02:28.780> changed<00:02:28.810> its<00:02:29.650> genes

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
we have modified or changed its genes

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.030 
we have modified or changed its genes
the<00:02:30.850> bacteria<00:02:31.420> duplicates<00:02:32.050> again<00:02:32.470> and<00:02:32.740> again

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
the bacteria duplicates again and again

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.640 
the bacteria duplicates again and again
to<00:02:33.400> make<00:02:33.610> many<00:02:34.030> many<00:02:34.510> bacteria<00:02:35.350> with<00:02:35.620> a

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
to make many many bacteria with a

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.910 
to make many many bacteria with a
insulin<00:02:36.459> gene<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:37.540> bacteria<00:02:38.050> have<00:02:38.320> a<00:02:38.350> human

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
insulin gene the bacteria have a human

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.699 
insulin gene the bacteria have a human
insulin<00:02:39.490> gene<00:02:39.820> so<00:02:40.540> they<00:02:40.660> make<00:02:40.840> human<00:02:41.290> insulin

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
insulin gene so they make human insulin

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.550 
insulin gene so they make human insulin
the<00:02:42.550> scientists<00:02:43.239> can<00:02:43.390> take<00:02:43.630> this<00:02:43.840> insulin<00:02:44.350> and

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
the scientists can take this insulin and

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.470 
the scientists can take this insulin and
give<00:02:44.739> it<00:02:44.890> to<00:02:44.920> people<00:02:45.220> with<00:02:45.550> diabetes<00:02:45.700> like

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
give it to people with diabetes like

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.110 
give it to people with diabetes like
praying<00:02:46.840> so<00:02:47.620> that<00:02:47.830> they<00:02:48.040> can<00:02:48.220> be<00:02:48.340> healthy<00:02:48.850> and

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
praying so that they can be healthy and

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:57.700 
praying so that they can be healthy and
happy

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.770
