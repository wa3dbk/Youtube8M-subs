00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
maybe gtp Ching

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.000 
maybe gtp Ching
and<00:02:44.329> back<00:02:44.510> to<00:02:44.719> this<00:02:44.840> one<00:02:45.049> here's<00:02:45.260> part<00:02:45.680> of<00:02:45.769> a<00:02:45.829> G

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
and back to this one here's part of a G

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.309 
and back to this one here's part of a G
chord<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.489> second<00:02:46.969> fret<00:02:47.150> a<00:02:47.180> and<00:02:48.109> do<00:02:48.349> the<00:02:50.319> okay

chord the second fret a and do the okay
so<00:02:51.379> that's<00:02:51.769> that<00:02:51.950> part<00:02:52.510> make<00:02:53.510> sure<00:02:53.659> you<00:02:53.750> sub

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
so that's that part make sure you sub

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.589 
so that's that part make sure you sub
ghupat<00:02:54.409> man<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:54.829> bid<00:02:55.010> slow<00:02:55.879> it<00:02:56.000> down<00:02:56.030> when<00:02:56.569> I

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
ghupat man and bid slow it down when I

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.069 
ghupat man and bid slow it down when I

80s and they had things it was already
set<00:03:05.510> up<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.659> lesson<00:03:06.019> plans<00:03:06.230> and<00:03:06.349> little

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
set up the lesson plans and little

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.140 
set up the lesson plans and little
subgroup<00:03:07.010> pieces<00:03:07.489> you<00:03:07.579> would<00:03:07.670> hear<00:03:07.939> it<00:03:08.030> in

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
subgroup pieces you would hear it in

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.330 
subgroup pieces you would hear it in
context<00:03:08.810> in<00:03:08.900> its<00:03:09.049> entirety<00:03:09.409> and<00:03:09.709> then<00:03:09.769> when

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
context in its entirety and then when

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.619 
context in its entirety and then when
you<00:03:10.459> practiced<00:03:10.909> it<00:03:11.030> it<00:03:11.150> was<00:03:11.269> in<00:03:11.389> little

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629 
you practiced it it was in little

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.250 
you practiced it it was in little
subgroups<00:03:13.150> that<00:03:14.150> worked<00:03:14.480> for<00:03:14.780> me<00:03:14.870> Matt<00:03:15.049> so

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
subgroups that worked for me Matt so

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.399 
subgroups that worked for me Matt so
I've<00:03:15.769> been<00:03:15.920> teaching<00:03:16.129> you<00:03:16.579> know<00:03:16.939> since<00:03:17.450> 91<00:03:17.900> 92

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:18.409 
I've been teaching you know since 91 92

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:23.860 
I've been teaching you know since 91 92
and<00:03:19.480> I've<00:03:20.590> brought<00:03:21.590> those<00:03:22.419> concepts<00:03:23.419> into<00:03:23.780> the

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
and I've brought those concepts into the

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.259 
and I've brought those concepts into the
way<00:03:23.989> I<00:03:24.019> teach<00:03:24.200> because<00:03:24.650> you<00:03:24.889> know<00:03:25.010> it<00:03:25.310> it

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
way I teach because you know it it

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:27.879 
way I teach because you know it it
worked<00:03:26.510> for<00:03:26.750> me<00:03:26.840> so<00:03:27.019> I<00:03:27.049> mean<00:03:27.290> I<00:03:27.319> like<00:03:27.560> to<00:03:27.709> show

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:27.889 
worked for me so I mean I like to show

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:29.259 
worked for me so I mean I like to show
things<00:03:28.099> that<00:03:28.220> work<00:03:28.459> in<00:03:28.639> trying<00:03:28.819> to<00:03:28.939> part<00:03:29.209> it

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
things that work in trying to part it

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:30.849 
things that work in trying to part it
that<00:03:29.450> way<00:03:29.629> and<00:03:29.780> in<00:03:29.930> a<00:03:29.989> common-sense<00:03:30.379> way<00:03:30.500> I'm

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
that way and in a common-sense way I'm

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:33.210 
that way and in a common-sense way I'm
not<00:03:30.980> a<00:03:31.040> real<00:03:31.310> deep<00:03:31.579> super<00:03:32.090> deep<00:03:32.389> theory<00:03:32.689> guy

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
not a real deep super deep theory guy

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.429 
not a real deep super deep theory guy
theory<00:03:34.220> really<00:03:35.090> throws<00:03:35.599> me<00:03:35.629> off<00:03:35.840> I<00:03:36.200> mean<00:03:36.319> I

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:36.439 
theory really throws me off I mean I

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:38.349 
theory really throws me off I mean I
dunno<00:03:36.620> theory<00:03:37.099> but<00:03:37.310> I<00:03:37.549> don't<00:03:37.909> like<00:03:38.060> to<00:03:38.209> think

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
dunno theory but I don't like to think

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:40.720 
dunno theory but I don't like to think
that<00:03:38.480> way<00:03:38.720> when<00:03:38.870> I'm<00:03:38.959> playing<00:03:39.340> but<00:03:40.340> I<00:03:40.400> do<00:03:40.459> have

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
that way when I'm playing but I do have

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.770 
that way when I'm playing but I do have
the<00:03:40.849> memory<00:03:41.120> for<00:03:41.299> music<00:03:41.659> in<00:03:41.810> the<00:03:43.780> creativity

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
the memory for music in the creativity

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.559 
the memory for music in the creativity
you<00:03:45.169> know<00:03:45.200> to<00:03:46.189> come<00:03:46.519> up<00:03:46.639> with<00:03:46.760> with<00:03:47.150> the<00:03:47.329> part

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
you know to come up with with the part

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.809 
you know to come up with with the part
so<00:03:47.900> subgroup<00:03:48.739> the<00:03:48.919> stuff<00:03:49.159> and<00:03:49.400> that'll<00:03:49.699> also

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
so subgroup the stuff and that'll also

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.000 
so subgroup the stuff and that'll also
let<00:03:50.239> you<00:03:50.389> know<00:03:50.419> how<00:03:51.049> clean<00:03:51.349> it<00:03:51.470> is<00:03:51.560> it<00:03:51.799> will

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
let you know how clean it is it will

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.580 
let you know how clean it is it will
help<00:03:52.190> you<00:03:52.400> you<00:03:53.060> know<00:03:53.180> to<00:03:53.239> build<00:03:53.599> upon<00:03:54.260> it<00:03:54.440> and

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
help you you know to build upon it and

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.229 
help you you know to build upon it and
then<00:03:54.680> you<00:03:54.769> you<00:03:55.250> know<00:03:55.340> before<00:03:56.000> you<00:03:56.030> know<00:03:56.090> you

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
then you you know before you know you

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:57.969 
then you you know before you know you
got<00:03:56.479> four<00:03:56.780> or<00:03:56.870> five<00:03:56.900> subgroups<00:03:57.470> together<00:03:57.769> and

00:03:57.969 --> 00:03:57.979 
got four or five subgroups together and

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:00.250 
got four or five subgroups together and
there's<00:03:58.099> the<00:03:58.280> whole<00:03:58.430> riff<00:03:58.609> okay<00:03:58.970> so<00:03:59.690> the

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
there's the whole riff okay so the

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.649 
there's the whole riff okay so the
distortion<00:04:00.590> part<00:04:00.949> really<00:04:01.220> straightforward

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:01.659 
distortion part really straightforward

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:07.210 
distortion part really straightforward
