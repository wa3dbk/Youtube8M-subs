00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.299
 are asking there are states that already 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.370
 they are asking about the name of us 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.220
 pieces toledo that we are musicians 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.210
 singers as it is a show as well as 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.640
 grupero 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.670
 how I grumble like that with grupera music 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.220
 we imitate comedians we go out dressed 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.260
 women we left like the hospital and 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.790
 durango the tube he had there so that the 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.930
 support them and because it is very 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.410
 pending everything they are doing 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.780
 because there are social networks that are 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.330
 constantly promoting those so no longer 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.430
 we have many already we have fans of networks 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.070
 social so we already have a lot of people 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.410
 that is supporting us there are several like 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.540
 this one that I am very sabadazo there are many 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.940
 people from various parts like venezuela 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.860
 guatemala that are not we have it for the 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.940
 face and that says a lot of people that 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.800
 we are looking forward to what we have 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.900
 very successful and what do we do 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.120
 laugh tell us for us you 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.590
 it was the winners that is what moves 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.900
 the countries on the other side I think the 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.480
 motivates to continue in all this to leave 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.850
 forward more than anything because it starts us 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.500
 from below and the desire to get ahead 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.900
 to improve ourselves to be good in life and 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.940
 health for the magazine in the cirh but the 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.060
