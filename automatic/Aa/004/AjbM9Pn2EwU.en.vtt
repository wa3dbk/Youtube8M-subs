00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.410
 Hello everyone, I want to 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.190
 demonstrate how tall 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.379
 the strongest sharply diameter 0 18 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:16.710
 prices when cutting here at the moment 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.329
 a distance of 30 meters it changes 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:21.960
 will provide a friend he led the traffic jams 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.529
 the forum is held on a hook 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:25.619
 take a look 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.189
 that's a matter of a formal political standard 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:29.859
 cutting down this issue will be seen 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:32.090
 does he hold almost no such 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.890
 the weather according to him in the area which led 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.520
 sweep 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.570
 formally sweat limit absolutely 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.780
 after all, in winter, more than a meter 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.040
 he holds and because of this reason rock 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.580
 think 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.830
 since it only remains so what is needed 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.830
 such a come to the program 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:53.890
 because if rubles are commenting 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.130
 speaks insignificant 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.370
 forged Novgorod proceeds we drown the autocad 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.370
 a little bit he mean 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.410
 so so the second part is a demonstration 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.870
 how stretched is omon 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.140
 seven year benda 018 ilona spleen 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.580
 but now we have changed places 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.310
 I have a friend's document 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.340
 simple led to the cold here with me 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.640
 see how I hold it 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.980
 he so you see 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.010
 almost all five fingers 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.530
 must pull up 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.270
 now see what happens 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.060
 so already started to show 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.550
 from a friend 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.200
 melting flowing 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.950
 Apparently a leak if one approximates 10 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.650
 I understand percent of fans 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.940
 all over the school case again 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.340
 reconsider 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.330
 here are your hands 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.790
 I do not know about the background in the case of 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.440
 white leak 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.200
 See Europe, he said 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.119
 now radioactivity 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.430
 what support 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.590
 often from absolute incomplete arch 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.740
 but even the gate ate 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.500
 but 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.439
 here 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.630
 he is telling the truth would be a half meter 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.710
 loss investigators 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.860
 the Japanese government and not lost 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:09.899
 I recommend on assignments 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.189
 comment on 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:13.349
 spare his data 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:14.909
 how much to stretch the cell 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:16.449
 if we do it for the sake of 

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:19.299
 total mass experiment is often a minimum 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:21.669
 stretched club face with water dots then 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:23.519
 we don't know about three meters 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.569
 so at the moment the hotel is 25 meters 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.900
 Do you know what will happen at 40 meters? 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.760
 fifty meters altogether absolute 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.089
 norms and will not just no choice 

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:35.149
 You think so 

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.939
 at the final
