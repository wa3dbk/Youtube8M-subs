00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.099 
Survivor Series and try to get his whole
look<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:56.879> everything<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.390> know<00:00:57.480> as<00:00:57.600> close<00:00:57.750> to

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
look and everything you know as close to

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.220 
look and everything you know as close to
the<00:00:58.289> actual<00:00:58.879> character<00:00:59.879> as<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.809> could<00:01:01.079> of

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
the actual character as I could of

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.229 
the actual character as I could of
course<00:01:01.559> it's<00:01:01.739> not<00:01:01.890> perfect<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.579> haven't

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
course it's not perfect I haven't

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.240 
course it's not perfect I haven't
created<00:01:03.420> too<00:01:04.170> many<00:01:04.350> characters<00:01:04.799> in<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.040> past

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
created too many characters in the past

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.410 
created too many characters in the past
this<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.460> really<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.880> first<00:01:06.030> one<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.360> I

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
this is really the first one that I

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.270 
this is really the first one that I
spent<00:01:06.630> some<00:01:06.750> time<00:01:06.780> on<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.229> tried<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.470> create

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
spent some time on and tried to create

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.490 
spent some time on and tried to create
as<00:01:08.640> accurately<00:01:09.240> as<00:01:09.390> possible<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.080> think<00:01:10.320> it

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
as accurately as possible and I think it

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.080 
as accurately as possible and I think it
came<00:01:10.710> out<00:01:10.860> pretty<00:01:10.979> good<00:01:11.130> obviously<00:01:11.460> we<00:01:11.880> had<00:01:11.970> to

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
came out pretty good obviously we had to

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.940 
came out pretty good obviously we had to
use<00:01:12.299> gold<00:01:12.900> dust<00:01:13.110> music<00:01:13.500> because<00:01:13.650> we<00:01:13.770> can't

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
use gold dust music because we can't

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.039 
use gold dust music because we can't
upload<00:01:14.159> custom<00:01:14.460> music<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:15.210> went<00:01:15.750> ahead<00:01:15.810> and
