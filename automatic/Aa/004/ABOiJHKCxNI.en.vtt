00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.430 
and salt I believe it said quarter
teaspoon<00:02:08.149> of<00:02:08.270> salt<00:02:08.569> but<00:02:09.020> you<00:02:09.140> can<00:02:09.229> kind<00:02:09.380> of

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
teaspoon of salt but you can kind of

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.830 
teaspoon of salt but you can kind of
season<00:02:09.830> to<00:02:09.979> taste<00:02:10.220> I<00:02:10.610> just<00:02:11.360> kind<00:02:11.450> of<00:02:11.540> poured<00:02:11.780> it

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
season to taste I just kind of poured it

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.930 
season to taste I just kind of poured it
in<00:02:11.900> my<00:02:11.959> hand<00:02:12.200> and<00:02:12.319> put<00:02:12.500> it<00:02:12.530> in<00:02:12.739> there<00:02:12.920> so<00:02:13.160> you

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
in my hand and put it in there so you

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.490 
in my hand and put it in there so you
mixed<00:02:14.180> it<00:02:14.239> up<00:02:14.330> you<00:02:14.690> probably<00:02:15.050> don't<00:02:15.170> even<00:02:15.349> need

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
mixed it up you probably don't even need

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.550 
mixed it up you probably don't even need
that<00:02:15.620> much<00:02:15.950> flour<00:02:16.190> to<00:02:16.400> be<00:02:16.520> honest<00:02:16.730> with<00:02:16.819> you

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
that much flour to be honest with you

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.810 
that much flour to be honest with you
because<00:02:18.560> when<00:02:18.710> I<00:02:18.740> made<00:02:18.920> my<00:02:18.950> night<00:02:19.250> at<00:02:19.400> a<00:02:19.430> ton<00:02:19.790> of

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
because when I made my night at a ton of

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.630 
because when I made my night at a ton of
leftover<00:02:20.390> flour<00:02:20.690> so<00:02:21.680> you<00:02:21.770> can<00:02:21.920> probably<00:02:22.190> drop

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
leftover flour so you can probably drop

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.280 
leftover flour so you can probably drop
it<00:02:22.850> down<00:02:22.970> to<00:02:23.030> only<00:02:23.240> use<00:02:23.510> so<00:02:24.020> you're<00:02:24.170> not

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
it down to only use so you're not

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.740 
it down to only use so you're not
wasting<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.800> flour<00:02:25.010> maybe<00:02:25.640> use<00:02:27.520> what<00:02:28.520> a<00:02:28.760> tack

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
wasting the flour maybe use what a tack

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.250 
wasting the flour maybe use what a tack
up<00:02:29.930> if<00:02:30.770> that<00:02:31.270> because<00:02:32.270> most<00:02:32.840> of<00:02:32.930> it<00:02:33.050> doesn't

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
up if that because most of it doesn't

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.170 
up if that because most of it doesn't
stick<00:02:33.410> to<00:02:33.440> the<00:02:33.620> idea<00:02:33.860> anyway<00:02:33.980> but<00:02:34.670> anyway<00:02:34.700> the

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
stick to the idea anyway but anyway the

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.910 
stick to the idea anyway but anyway the
next<00:02:35.690> part<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:35.930> most<00:02:36.080> important<00:02:36.410> part<00:02:36.590> is<00:02:36.770> an

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
next part the most important part is an

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.310 
next part the most important part is an
onion<00:02:37.190> okay<00:02:37.880> you're<00:02:38.720> supposed<00:02:38.930> to<00:02:38.990> use<00:02:39.140> the

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
that's what we've been using so the

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.040 
that's what we've been using so the
serving<00:02:49.640> size<00:02:49.820> is<00:02:49.850> going<00:02:50.150> to<00:02:50.210> vary<00:02:50.480> it's

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
supposed to be six servings I'm assuming

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.540 
supposed to be six servings I'm assuming
this<00:02:57.140> is<00:02:57.290> about<00:02:57.320> half<00:02:57.740> that<00:02:57.770> size<00:02:58.220> especially

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
this is about half that size especially

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.130 
this is about half that size especially
by<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.030> time<00:02:59.209> you<00:02:59.330> cut<00:02:59.570> it<00:02:59.690> up<00:02:59.840> and<00:02:59.930> you<00:03:00.050> get

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
by the time you cut it up and you get

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.420 
by the time you cut it up and you get
those<00:03:00.290> little<00:03:00.560> leftover<00:03:00.800> pieces<00:03:01.130> that<00:03:01.400> you

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
those little leftover pieces that you

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.380 
those little leftover pieces that you
don't<00:03:01.640> really<00:03:01.880> eat<00:03:02.030> onion<00:03:02.420> rings<00:03:02.570> anyway<00:03:02.870> so

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
don't really eat onion rings anyway so

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.190 
don't really eat onion rings anyway so
what<00:03:05.390> you<00:03:05.450> can<00:03:05.540> do<00:03:05.630> is<00:03:05.720> you<00:03:05.780> going<00:03:05.900> to<00:03:05.959> your

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
what you can do is you going to your

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.320 
what you can do is you going to your
skin<00:03:06.560> your<00:03:06.680> onion<00:03:06.980> then<00:03:07.400> you're<00:03:07.910> going<00:03:08.000> to<00:03:08.060> cut

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
skin your onion then you're going to cut

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:14.910 
skin your onion then you're going to cut
it<00:03:08.450> into<00:03:10.870> quarter-inch<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:12.170> half-inch<00:03:12.620> slices

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.199 
it into quarter-inch to half-inch slices
and<00:03:15.920> then<00:03:15.980> when<00:03:16.370> you<00:03:16.459> take<00:03:16.640> those<00:03:16.790> slices<00:03:16.970> you

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
and then when you take those slices you

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.330 
and then when you take those slices you
have<00:03:17.300> to<00:03:17.390> pop<00:03:17.630> them<00:03:17.840> apart<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.470> Rings<00:03:18.680> you
