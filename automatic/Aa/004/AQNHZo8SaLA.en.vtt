so<00:00:04.870> in<00:00:04.960> this<00:00:05.050> section<00:00:05.440> you're<00:00:05.529> going<00:00:05.620> to<00:00:05.770> get<00:00:05.920> a

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:06.160 
so in this section you're going to get a

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.950 
so in this section you're going to get a
set<00:00:06.490> of<00:00:06.700> variables<00:00:07.359> that<00:00:07.450> are<00:00:07.660> going<00:00:07.779> to<00:00:07.899> be

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:07.960 
set of variables that are going to be

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.160 
set of variables that are going to be
changing<00:00:08.410> you<00:00:09.250> can<00:00:09.400> see<00:00:09.580> them<00:00:09.760> here<00:00:09.790> in<00:00:10.299> the

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.170 
changing you can see them here in the

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:17.330 
changing you can see them here in the
SolidWorks<00:00:11.860> sample<00:00:12.370> exam<00:00:12.760> for<00:00:13.210> the<00:00:13.360> CSW<00:00:13.780> p<00:00:15.750> and

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
SolidWorks sample exam for the CSW p and

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.589 
SolidWorks sample exam for the CSW p and
these<00:00:18.340> are<00:00:18.490> going<00:00:18.580> to<00:00:18.640> be<00:00:18.759> the<00:00:18.880> main<00:00:19.090> values

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:19.599 
these are going to be the main values

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:21.210 
these are going to be the main values
that<00:00:19.779> can<00:00:19.900> be<00:00:19.960> changing<00:00:20.439> there<00:00:20.590> will<00:00:20.800> be<00:00:20.829> also

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
that can be changing there will be also

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.999 
that can be changing there will be also
changes<00:00:21.640> to<00:00:21.790> the<00:00:21.880> models<00:00:22.239> but<00:00:22.570> if<00:00:22.900> I<00:00:23.050> look<00:00:23.290> into

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:26.009 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:31.019 

the<00:00:27.009> drawings<00:00:28.380> for<00:00:29.380> this<00:00:29.680> part<00:00:30.250> you<00:00:30.820> can<00:00:31.000> see

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
the drawings for this part you can see

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.240 
the drawings for this part you can see
different<00:00:31.809> sections<00:00:32.439> are<00:00:32.619> labeled<00:00:33.040> with

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
different sections are labeled with

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.430 
different sections are labeled with
those<00:00:33.430> variables<00:00:33.790> for<00:00:34.210> example<00:00:34.300> a<00:00:34.809> is<00:00:34.989> here

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
those variables for example a is here

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:42.900 
those variables for example a is here
you<00:00:36.219> have<00:00:36.340> B<00:00:36.640> and<00:00:36.969> C<00:00:40.800> your<00:00:41.800> value<00:00:42.160> for<00:00:42.190> D<00:00:42.640> as

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
you have B and C your value for D as

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.849 
you have B and C your value for D as
well<00:00:43.329> as<00:00:43.570> E<00:00:43.780> and<00:00:44.199> x<00:00:44.890> and<00:00:45.760> y<00:00:46.530> that's<00:00:47.530> all<00:00:47.739> it

00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:47.859 
well as E and x and y that's all it

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:49.410 
well as E and x and y that's all it
works<00:00:48.010> has<00:00:48.129> several<00:00:48.460> suggestions<00:00:48.850> it<00:00:49.210> says

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
works has several suggestions it says

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.569 
works has several suggestions it says
you<00:00:49.570> can<00:00:49.719> use<00:00:49.749> linked<00:00:50.350> values<00:00:50.769> or<00:00:51.070> equations

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
you can use linked values or equations

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:57.529 
you can use linked values or equations
or<00:00:51.929> use<00:00:53.609> dimension<00:00:54.609> labels<00:00:54.969> so<00:00:55.420> for<00:00:55.719> example

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
or use dimension labels so for example

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.149 
or use dimension labels so for example
if<00:00:58.539> I<00:00:58.690> create<00:00:58.989> a<00:00:59.199> drawing<00:00:59.559> on<00:00:59.800> the<00:00:59.980> top<00:01:00.219> plane

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:02.159 
if I create a drawing on the top plane

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:09.060 
if I create a drawing on the top plane
and<00:01:04.170> give<00:01:05.170> this<00:01:05.350> a<00:01:05.409> dimension<00:01:05.980> I<00:01:07.860> can<00:01:08.860> label

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
and give this a dimension I can label

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
and give this a dimension I can label
this<00:01:09.369> dimension<00:01:09.970> as<00:01:10.149> a

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.819 

and<00:01:14.179> that<00:01:14.899> will<00:01:14.990> help<00:01:15.109> you<00:01:15.289> remind<00:01:15.590> you<00:01:15.799> that

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:15.829 
and that will help you remind you that

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:19.539 
and that will help you remind you that
this<00:01:16.159> is<00:01:16.429> your<00:01:16.729> a<00:01:16.939> dimension<00:01:17.509> and<00:01:18.399> this<00:01:19.399> can

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
this is your a dimension and this can

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.240 
this is your a dimension and this can
pretty<00:01:19.729> easily<00:01:19.939> be<00:01:20.299> brought<00:01:20.810> into<00:01:21.109> a<00:01:21.679> design

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
pretty easily be brought into a design

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.919 
pretty easily be brought into a design
table<00:01:22.549> if<00:01:22.789> you<00:01:22.909> want<00:01:23.119> as<00:01:23.240> well<00:01:23.270> and<00:01:23.569> you<00:01:23.659> can

00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:23.929 
table if you want as well and you can

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:26.649 
table if you want as well and you can
make<00:01:24.079> your<00:01:24.200> updates<00:01:24.619> from<00:01:24.799> there<00:01:25.299> this<00:01:26.299> is<00:01:26.479> not

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
make your updates from there this is not

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.450 
make your updates from there this is not
the<00:01:26.840> method<00:01:26.990> that<00:01:27.289> I<00:01:27.319> typically<00:01:27.799> use<00:01:27.920> and<00:01:28.399> I'm

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
the method that I typically use and I'm

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.919 
the method that I typically use and I'm
going<00:01:28.700> to<00:01:28.789> suggest<00:01:28.939> something<00:01:29.479> a<00:01:29.569> little<00:01:29.810> bit

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:29.929 
going to suggest something a little bit

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:37.120 
going to suggest something a little bit
different<00:01:34.630> so<00:01:35.630> if<00:01:35.719> I<00:01:35.810> go<00:01:35.990> into<00:01:36.170> equations<00:01:36.890> and

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
different so if I go into equations and

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.340 
different so if I go into equations and
choose<00:01:37.459> manage<00:01:37.759> equations<00:01:40.630> you<00:01:41.630> can<00:01:41.780> see<00:01:42.049> that

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
choose manage equations you can see that

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.389 
choose manage equations you can see that
there's<00:01:42.649> options<00:01:42.890> to<00:01:43.369> suppress<00:01:44.149> features<00:01:44.600> at

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
there's options to suppress features at

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:48.880 
there's options to suppress features at
very<00:01:46.399> specific<00:01:46.880> equations<00:01:47.420> or<00:01:47.720> add<00:01:48.560> what's

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
very specific equations or add what's

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.089 
very specific equations or add what's
known<00:01:49.130> as<00:01:49.369> a<00:01:49.399> global<00:01:49.849> variable<00:01:50.149> and<00:01:50.810> a<00:01:51.739> global

00:01:52.089 --> 00:01:52.099 
known as a global variable and a global

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:55.539 
known as a global variable and a global
variable<00:01:52.459> is<00:01:52.640> just<00:01:53.030> some<00:01:53.979> name<00:01:54.979> that<00:01:55.280> you<00:01:55.429> give

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
variable is just some name that you give

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:01.020 
variable is just some name that you give
this<00:01:56.530> that<00:01:57.530> stores<00:01:58.009> a<00:01:58.340> value<00:01:58.369> or<00:01:59.179> an<00:01:59.450> equation

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
this that stores a value or an equation

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.569 
this that stores a value or an equation
so<00:02:02.030> just<00:02:02.360> like<00:02:02.509> we<00:02:02.689> had<00:02:02.899> in<00:02:03.289> the<00:02:03.799> sample<00:02:04.189> exam

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 
so just like we had in the sample exam

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:08.589 
so just like we had in the sample exam
if<00:02:04.849> I<00:02:05.030> wanted<00:02:05.270> to<00:02:05.390> define<00:02:05.689> a<00:02:06.340> let's<00:02:07.340> say<00:02:07.549> as<00:02:07.759> 200

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
if I wanted to define a let's say as 200

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:14.500 
if I wanted to define a let's say as 200
I<00:02:08.780> can<00:02:09.560> do<00:02:09.649> that<00:02:10.599> and<00:02:12.579> then<00:02:13.579> I<00:02:13.700> can<00:02:13.849> define<00:02:14.000> a<00:02:14.180> B

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
I can do that and then I can define a B

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.720 
I can do that and then I can define a B
and<00:02:14.750> I<00:02:15.260> just<00:02:15.440> have<00:02:15.530> to<00:02:15.680> hit<00:02:15.739> enter<00:02:15.980> and<00:02:16.400> this<00:02:16.640> is

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
and I just have to hit enter and this is

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
and I just have to hit enter and this is
going<00:02:16.819> to<00:02:16.879> take<00:02:17.030> me<00:02:17.180> straight<00:02:17.450> into<00:02:17.599> the<00:02:17.690> next

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
going to take me straight into the next

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.440 
going to take me straight into the next
box<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:18.440> this<00:02:19.280> is<00:02:19.430> typically<00:02:19.940> going<00:02:20.120> to<00:02:20.329> be

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
box and this is typically going to be

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.170 
box and this is typically going to be
the<00:02:20.660> fastest<00:02:21.139> way<00:02:21.380> to<00:02:22.040> define<00:02:22.700> all<00:02:23.030> these

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
the fastest way to define all these

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.250 
the fastest way to define all these
variables<00:02:23.600> and<00:02:23.930> keep<00:02:24.079> track<00:02:24.319> of<00:02:24.380> them<00:02:26.139> so<00:02:27.139> I'll

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
variables and keep track of them so I'll

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.780 
variables and keep track of them so I'll
just<00:02:27.380> go<00:02:27.530> ahead<00:02:27.560> and<00:02:27.889> give<00:02:28.040> these<00:02:28.220> arbitrary

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
just go ahead and give these arbitrary

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:37.560 
just go ahead and give these arbitrary
values<00:02:29.239> and<00:02:29.540> I'll<00:02:29.930> just<00:02:30.139> create<00:02:30.410> for

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.360 

so<00:02:38.570> now<00:02:38.720> these<00:02:38.900> are<00:02:39.050> stored<00:02:39.500> in<00:02:39.710> my<00:02:39.860> equations

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
so now these are stored in my equations

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.170 
so now these are stored in my equations
folder<00:02:40.910> as<00:02:41.060> global<00:02:41.930> variables<00:02:41.960> and<00:02:43.030> I<00:02:44.030> can

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
folder as global variables and I can

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.710 
folder as global variables and I can
access<00:02:44.540> them<00:02:45.730> through<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:46.910> smart<00:02:47.240> dimension

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
access them through the smart dimension

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.770 
access them through the smart dimension
command<00:02:49.120> inside<00:02:50.120> of<00:02:50.240> my<00:02:50.360> sketch<00:02:52.510> so<00:02:53.510> I'll<00:02:53.630> go

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
command inside of my sketch so I'll go

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.740 
command inside of my sketch so I'll go
ahead<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:54.290> create<00:02:54.590> a<00:02:55.010> few<00:02:55.910> smart<00:02:56.240> dimensions

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
ahead and create a few smart dimensions

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.730 
ahead and create a few smart dimensions
and<00:02:58.390> to<00:02:59.390> add<00:02:59.510> an<00:02:59.660> equation<00:02:59.960> all<00:03:00.290> we<00:03:00.410> have<00:03:00.530> to<00:03:00.620> do

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
and to add an equation all we have to do

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.000 
and to add an equation all we have to do
is<00:03:00.890> use<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.370> equal<00:03:01.790> sign<00:03:02.060> in<00:03:02.330> past<00:03:03.320> years<00:03:03.710> if

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
is use the equal sign in past years if

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.080 
is use the equal sign in past years if
you're<00:03:04.160> using<00:03:04.720> 2011<00:03:05.720> or<00:03:05.960> earlier<00:03:06.860> there<00:03:07.610> was<00:03:07.850> a

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
you're using 2011 or earlier there was a

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.350 
you're using 2011 or earlier there was a
pulldown<00:03:08.630> to<00:03:09.620> add<00:03:09.830> an<00:03:10.010> equation<00:03:10.310> now<00:03:11.120> it's

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
pulldown to add an equation now it's

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.860 
pulldown to add an equation now it's
simply<00:03:11.690> using<00:03:12.020> the<00:03:12.260> equal<00:03:12.590> sign<00:03:13.510> you<00:03:14.510> can<00:03:14.660> see

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
simply using the equal sign you can see

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.440 
simply using the equal sign you can see
if<00:03:15.140> I<00:03:15.350> say<00:03:15.620> equals<00:03:16.070> it's<00:03:16.580> going<00:03:16.970> to<00:03:17.120> give<00:03:17.300> me<00:03:17.420> a

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
if I say equals it's going to give me a

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.100 
if I say equals it's going to give me a
list<00:03:17.720> of<00:03:18.790> functions<00:03:19.790> properties<00:03:20.600> as<00:03:20.810> well<00:03:21.050> as

list of functions properties as well as
the<00:03:21.350> global<00:03:21.470> variables<00:03:22.160> that<00:03:22.280> have<00:03:22.430> stored<00:03:22.850> I

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
the global variables that have stored I

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.440 
the global variables that have stored I
can<00:03:24.410> also<00:03:24.560> simply<00:03:24.980> just<00:03:25.190> type<00:03:25.400> in<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:26.150> name<00:03:26.300> of

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
can also simply just type in the name of

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.510 
can also simply just type in the name of
the<00:03:26.570> global<00:03:26.840> variable<00:03:27.260> and<00:03:27.410> then<00:03:27.920> click<00:03:28.190> on<00:03:28.370> it

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
the global variable and then click on it

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.960 
the global variable and then click on it
and<00:03:28.640> it's<00:03:28.910> going<00:03:29.060> to<00:03:29.180> bring<00:03:29.330> it<00:03:29.480> in<00:03:30.850> what<00:03:31.850> you

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
and it's going to bring it in what you

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.180 
and it's going to bring it in what you
want<00:03:32.120> to<00:03:32.210> be<00:03:32.270> careful<00:03:32.690> of<00:03:32.810> when<00:03:33.380> you<00:03:33.770> add<00:03:33.950> in

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
want to be careful of when you add in

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.650 
want to be careful of when you add in
the<00:03:34.220> global<00:03:34.610> variable<00:03:35.000> is<00:03:35.150> that<00:03:35.330> you<00:03:35.450> don't

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
the global variable is that you don't

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.100 
the global variable is that you don't
just<00:03:35.840> add<00:03:36.020> in<00:03:36.230> a<00:03:37.150> because<00:03:38.150> this<00:03:38.330> will<00:03:38.540> assign

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
just add in a because this will assign

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.430 
just add in a because this will assign
the<00:03:39.380> dimension<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:42.500> this<00:03:42.730> smart<00:03:43.730> dimension

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
the dimension to this smart dimension

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.070 
the dimension to this smart dimension
but<00:03:45.440> when<00:03:46.190> I<00:03:46.220> go<00:03:46.670> to<00:03:46.700> update<00:03:47.090> a<00:03:47.480> this<00:03:47.810> isn't

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
but when I go to update a this isn't

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.750 
but when I go to update a this isn't
going<00:03:48.200> to<00:03:48.290> update<00:03:48.650> because<00:03:49.130> it<00:03:49.400> simply

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
going to update because it simply

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.880 
going to update because it simply
translates<00:03:50.300> over<00:03:50.630> that<00:03:50.960> value<00:03:51.230> of<00:03:51.500> 200

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
translates over that value of 200

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.030 
translates over that value of 200
millimeters<00:03:52.810> so<00:03:53.810> I<00:03:53.840> have<00:03:53.930> to<00:03:54.050> use<00:03:54.170> an<00:03:54.320> equals<00:03:54.770> a

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
millimeters so I have to use an equals a

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.490 
millimeters so I have to use an equals a
and<00:03:57.520> you<00:03:58.520> can<00:03:58.640> see<00:03:58.790> the<00:03:58.910> equation<00:03:59.150> sign<00:03:59.750> right

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
and you can see the equation sign right

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.400 
and you can see the equation sign right
next<00:04:00.860> to<00:04:00.950> the<00:04:01.040> 200<00:04:01.550> that<00:04:01.840> means<00:04:02.840> when<00:04:02.990> I<00:04:03.020> update

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
next to the 200 that means when I update

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.270 
next to the 200 that means when I update
my<00:04:03.440> global<00:04:03.980> variables<00:04:05.740> that<00:04:06.740> value<00:04:07.160> will

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
my global variables that value will

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.330 
my global variables that value will
update<00:04:08.110> I'll<00:04:09.110> go<00:04:09.350> ahead<00:04:09.440> and<00:04:09.650> make<00:04:09.770> this<00:04:09.950> equal

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
update I'll go ahead and make this equal

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:18.590 
update I'll go ahead and make this equal
to<00:04:10.490> be

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.480 

and<00:04:18.690> then<00:04:19.380> I'll<00:04:19.500> go<00:04:19.650> ahead<00:04:19.680> and<00:04:19.950> just<00:04:19.980> add<00:04:20.220> an

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:20.490 
and then I'll go ahead and just add an

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:22.820 
and then I'll go ahead and just add an
arbitrary<00:04:21.120> circle<00:04:21.570> here<00:04:21.930> so<00:04:22.260> I<00:04:22.290> can<00:04:22.500> add<00:04:22.680> in

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
arbitrary circle here so I can add in

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:40.780 
arbitrary circle here so I can add in
those<00:04:22.980> other<00:04:23.250> global<00:04:23.640> variables

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.730 

and<00:04:40.880> next<00:04:41.600> to<00:04:41.780> global<00:04:42.110> variable<00:04:42.500> we<00:04:42.620> could

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
and next to global variable we could

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.590 
and next to global variable we could
just<00:04:42.980> as<00:04:43.100> easily<00:04:43.130> add<00:04:43.580> in<00:04:43.850> some<00:04:44.330> sort<00:04:44.570> of

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
just as easily add in some sort of

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.600 
just as easily add in some sort of
operator<00:04:45.020> for<00:04:45.590> example<00:04:45.680> divided<00:04:46.340> by<00:04:46.460> two<00:04:47.320> and

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
operator for example divided by two and

00:04:48.610 --> 00:05:01.480 
operator for example divided by two and
it'll<00:04:49.610> create<00:04:49.880> that<00:04:50.090> equation<00:04:50.720> as<00:04:50.890> well

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.740 

so<00:05:02.490> now<00:05:02.610> I'm<00:05:02.670> going<00:05:02.790> to<00:05:02.850> go<00:05:02.940> ahead<00:05:03.060> and<00:05:03.270> show<00:05:03.540> my

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
so now I'm going to go ahead and show my

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.420 
so now I'm going to go ahead and show my
feature<00:05:04.050> dimensions<00:05:04.680> so<00:05:04.860> we<00:05:04.890> can<00:05:05.100> see<00:05:05.310> how

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
feature dimensions so we can see how

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.150 
feature dimensions so we can see how
these<00:05:05.610> update<00:05:06.090> and<00:05:06.590> we<00:05:07.590> can<00:05:07.740> go<00:05:07.860> ahead<00:05:07.890> and

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
these update and we can go ahead and

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:15.080 
these update and we can go ahead and
just<00:05:08.430> go<00:05:08.580> into<00:05:08.760> manage<00:05:09.060> equations<00:05:11.510> and<00:05:13.880> make<00:05:14.880> a

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
just go into manage equations and make a

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.010 
just go into manage equations and make a
quick<00:05:15.450> change<00:05:15.780> to<00:05:16.580> each<00:05:17.580> of<00:05:17.760> these<00:05:18.020> dimensions

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
quick change to each of these dimensions

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.240 
quick change to each of these dimensions
and<00:05:20.810> you<00:05:21.810> can<00:05:21.930> see<00:05:22.080> there's<00:05:22.260> a<00:05:22.320> slight<00:05:22.500> lag<00:05:22.950> on

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
and you can see there's a slight lag on

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.070 
and you can see there's a slight lag on
the<00:05:23.490> update<00:05:23.910> to<00:05:24.330> these<00:05:24.690> equations<00:05:25.230> and

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
the update to these equations and

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.600 
the update to these equations and
there's<00:05:28.080> a<00:05:28.170> slightly<00:05:28.680> quicker<00:05:28.950> method<00:05:29.460> that

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
there's a slightly quicker method that

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.930 
there's a slightly quicker method that
I'll<00:05:29.730> show<00:05:30.000> in<00:05:30.270> a<00:05:30.360> second<00:05:30.810> that<00:05:30.870> will<00:05:31.790> save<00:05:32.790> you

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
I'll show in a second that will save you

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.900 
I'll show in a second that will save you
even<00:05:33.090> more<00:05:33.240> time<00:05:33.630> if<00:05:33.870> you<00:05:33.900> want<00:05:34.520> but<00:05:35.520> it's<00:05:35.760> not

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
even more time if you want but it's not

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:40.010 
even more time if you want but it's not
absolutely<00:05:36.090> necessary<00:05:36.480> for<00:05:38.690> passing<00:05:39.690> the<00:05:39.780> CS

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
absolutely necessary for passing the CS

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.610 
absolutely necessary for passing the CS
WP<00:05:41.720> so<00:05:42.720> you<00:05:42.780> can<00:05:42.900> see<00:05:43.080> all<00:05:43.230> of<00:05:43.260> these<00:05:43.410> values

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
WP so you can see all of these values

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.750 
WP so you can see all of these values
updated<00:05:44.870> as<00:05:45.870> soon<00:05:45.990> as<00:05:46.260> I<00:05:46.350> exit<00:05:46.740> the<00:05:46.980> equations

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.810 

now<00:05:57.780> I<00:05:57.810> did<00:05:58.050> mention<00:05:58.080> a<00:05:58.590> slightly<00:05:59.190> quicker<00:05:59.610> way

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
now I did mention a slightly quicker way

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.060 
now I did mention a slightly quicker way
to<00:05:59.850> manage<00:06:00.300> this<00:06:00.540> we<00:06:01.260> can<00:06:01.440> go<00:06:01.620> ahead<00:06:01.710> and

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 
to manage this we can go ahead and

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:09.350 
to manage this we can go ahead and
export<00:06:04.940> the<00:06:05.940> equations<00:06:06.480> if<00:06:06.630> we<00:06:06.660> want<00:06:08.120> I'll<00:06:09.120> go

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
export the equations if we want I'll go

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.700 
export the equations if we want I'll go
ahead<00:06:09.450> and<00:06:09.660> just<00:06:09.780> export<00:06:10.230> these<00:06:10.380> to<00:06:10.590> the

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 
ahead and just export these to the

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.909 
ahead and just export these to the
desktop

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:19.510 

and<00:06:16.009> then<00:06:16.610> we<00:06:16.759> get<00:06:16.849> an<00:06:16.969> option<00:06:17.389> to<00:06:17.419> export<00:06:18.520> all

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 
and then we get an option to export all

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.850 
and then we get an option to export all
of<00:06:19.580> our<00:06:20.509> equations<00:06:20.990> and<00:06:21.229> I'll<00:06:21.409> go<00:06:21.590> ahead<00:06:21.680> and

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.860 
of our equations and I'll go ahead and

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.089 
of our equations and I'll go ahead and
remove<00:06:22.009> out<00:06:23.050> the<00:06:24.050> dimension<00:06:24.499> equations<00:06:24.949> we

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:25.099 
remove out the dimension equations we

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:28.209 
remove out the dimension equations we
have<00:06:25.279> as<00:06:25.960> we<00:06:26.960> won't<00:06:27.199> need<00:06:27.319> to<00:06:27.379> update<00:06:27.770> these<00:06:27.949> at

00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:28.219 
have as we won't need to update these at

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:44.970 
have as we won't need to update these at
all

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:44.980 

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.000 

so<00:06:45.580> now<00:06:45.760> if<00:06:45.910> I<00:06:46.000> pull<00:06:46.240> up<00:06:46.270> that<00:06:46.600> equations<00:06:47.320> text

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.010 
so now if I pull up that equations text

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:52.570 
so now if I pull up that equations text
file

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:52.580 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.200 

I<00:06:52.610> can<00:06:53.330> see<00:06:53.480> I<00:06:53.510> have<00:06:53.750> all<00:06:53.960> those<00:06:54.140> values<00:06:54.620> and<00:06:55.210> if

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:56.210 
I can see I have all those values and if

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.030 
I can see I have all those values and if
I<00:06:56.270> go<00:06:56.450> into<00:06:56.630> the<00:06:56.840> managed<00:06:57.170> equations<00:06:57.650> you'll

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:58.040 
I go into the managed equations you'll

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.300 
I go into the managed equations you'll
notice<00:06:58.370> that<00:06:58.670> these<00:06:59.150> are<00:06:59.210> now<00:06:59.450> grayed<00:06:59.720> out<00:06:59.750> as

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:00.310 
notice that these are now grayed out as

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.860 
notice that these are now grayed out as
they're<00:07:01.310> linked<00:07:01.670> specifically<00:07:02.240> to<00:07:02.420> that<00:07:02.450> file

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:02.870 
they're linked specifically to that file

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.030 
they're linked specifically to that file
and<00:07:03.110> they<00:07:03.440> will<00:07:03.590> only<00:07:03.770> update<00:07:04.010> from<00:07:04.460> that<00:07:04.610> file

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:06.040 
and they will only update from that file

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.500 
and they will only update from that file
you<00:07:07.040> could<00:07:07.190> always<00:07:07.430> unlink<00:07:08.030> these<00:07:08.210> if<00:07:08.390> you

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:08.510 
you could always unlink these if you

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:15.850 
you could always unlink these if you
want<00:07:10.810> and<00:07:12.850> now<00:07:13.850> if<00:07:14.060> I<00:07:14.210> make<00:07:14.450> a<00:07:14.630> quick<00:07:14.930> change<00:07:15.380> to

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:15.860 
want and now if I make a quick change to

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:30.399 
want and now if I make a quick change to
my<00:07:16.190> document

00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:30.409 

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:35.580 

and<00:07:30.499> save<00:07:31.369> this<00:07:31.580> out

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:35.590 

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:38.550 

when<00:07:36.220> I<00:07:36.250> rebuild<00:07:36.970> my<00:07:37.210> part<00:07:37.540> it's<00:07:38.230> going<00:07:38.470> to

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560 
when I rebuild my part it's going to

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.070 
when I rebuild my part it's going to
automatically<00:07:38.980> update<00:07:39.690> so<00:07:40.690> if<00:07:40.780> you<00:07:40.870> want<00:07:41.020> a

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:41.080 
automatically update so if you want a

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.909 
automatically update so if you want a
slightly<00:07:41.380> quicker<00:07:41.800> option<00:07:42.400> of<00:07:42.850> updating

00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 
slightly quicker option of updating

00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:46.379 
slightly quicker option of updating
otherwise<00:07:44.919> it's<00:07:45.160> easy<00:07:45.310> enough<00:07:45.520> to<00:07:45.700> just<00:07:46.210> come

00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:46.389 
otherwise it's easy enough to just come

00:07:46.389 --> 00:07:48.600 
otherwise it's easy enough to just come
in<00:07:46.510> to<00:07:46.540> manage<00:07:46.780> equations<00:07:47.380> and<00:07:47.680> update<00:07:48.400> each

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:48.610 
in to manage equations and update each

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:52.170 
in to manage equations and update each
of<00:07:48.790> these<00:07:48.910> values<00:07:49.120> individually<00:07:50.970> you<00:07:51.970> could

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:52.180 
of these values individually you could

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.540 
of these values individually you could
also<00:07:52.450> bring<00:07:52.960> these<00:07:53.169> values<00:07:53.919> into<00:07:54.190> a<00:07:54.220> design

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:54.550 
also bring these values into a design

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:56.010 
also bring these values into a design
table<00:07:54.790> I<00:07:55.120> won't<00:07:55.300> discuss<00:07:55.630> that<00:07:55.810> option

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:56.020 
table I won't discuss that option

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.560 
table I won't discuss that option
because<00:07:56.590> I<00:07:56.620> think<00:07:56.830> this<00:07:57.250> one<00:07:57.490> is<00:07:57.700> quite<00:07:58.300> a<00:07:58.330> bit

00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:58.570 
because I think this one is quite a bit

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:01.290 
because I think this one is quite a bit
faster<00:07:59.020> for<00:07:59.050> the<00:07:59.260> CSW<00:07:59.650> P<00:07:59.980> then<00:08:00.700> going<00:08:01.090> to<00:08:01.180> the

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:01.300 
faster for the CSW P then going to the

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:05.820 
faster for the CSW P then going to the
length<00:08:01.570> of<00:08:01.810> creating<00:08:02.410> a<00:08:02.500> design<00:08:02.830> table<00:08:04.830> but

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:05.830 
length of creating a design table but

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:07.230 
length of creating a design table but
managing<00:08:06.220> the<00:08:06.310> variables<00:08:06.730> in<00:08:06.880> this<00:08:06.970> manner

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:07.240 
managing the variables in this manner

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.150 
managing the variables in this manner
will<00:08:07.450> allow<00:08:07.690> you<00:08:07.750> to<00:08:07.870> quickly<00:08:08.169> update<00:08:08.680> each

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:09.160 
will allow you to quickly update each
