probably<00:01:46.350> going<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.649> use<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.920> 720p<00:01:47.549> 60<00:01:48.090> frames

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
probably going to use the 720p 60 frames

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.460 
probably going to use the 720p 60 frames
per<00:01:48.420> second<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.810> most<00:01:48.990> because<00:01:49.259> it's<00:01:49.380> the

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
per second the most because it's the

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.289 
per second the most because it's the
most<00:01:49.590> efficient<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.430> nicest<00:01:50.820> quality

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
most efficient and the nicest quality

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.179 
most efficient and the nicest quality
and<00:01:51.780> yeah<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.500> guys<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.799> can<00:01:52.920> take

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
video is probably going to be the most

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
if it's the camera well but the battery

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.290 
if it's the camera well but the battery
life<00:05:11.010> is<00:05:11.220> not<00:05:11.460> something<00:05:11.760> I'm<00:05:11.850> pleased<00:05:12.090> with

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
life is not something I'm pleased with

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.320 
life is not something I'm pleased with
at<00:05:12.450> all<00:05:12.690> your<00:05:13.350> SD<00:05:13.860> card<00:05:14.190> will<00:05:14.520> outlast<00:05:15.090> the

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
at all your SD card will outlast the

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.760 
at all your SD card will outlast the
battery<00:05:15.630> life<00:05:15.840> of<00:05:15.960> this<00:05:16.110> camera<00:05:16.380> which<00:05:16.650> is

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
battery life of this camera which is

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.650 
battery life of this camera which is
either<00:05:16.890> a<00:05:17.010> good<00:05:17.280> thing<00:05:17.520> or<00:05:17.700> a<00:05:17.970> bad<00:05:18.060> thing<00:05:18.210> I

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
either a good thing or a bad thing I

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.840 
either a good thing or a bad thing I
have<00:05:18.750> a<00:05:18.840> 16<00:05:19.290> gigabyte<00:05:19.530> SD<00:05:19.860> card<00:05:20.220> that<00:05:20.340> shoots<00:05:20.580> 2

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
have a 16 gigabyte SD card that shoots 2

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.180 
have a 16 gigabyte SD card that shoots 2
hours<00:05:21.150> of<00:05:21.270> footage<00:05:21.510> and<00:05:21.840> the<00:05:22.590> battery<00:05:22.920> seems

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
hours of footage and the battery seems

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.010 
hours of footage and the battery seems
to<00:05:23.280> only<00:05:23.400> last<00:05:23.730> an<00:05:23.940> hour<00:05:24.090> and<00:05:24.300> a<00:05:24.450> half<00:05:24.630> or<00:05:24.810> so

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
to only last an hour and a half or so

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.590 
to only last an hour and a half or so
which<00:05:25.650> is<00:05:25.680> a<00:05:25.830> downside<00:05:26.280> and<00:05:26.520> the<00:05:26.850> camera<00:05:27.390> also

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
which is a downside and the camera also

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.450 
which is a downside and the camera also
gets<00:05:27.900> really<00:05:28.380> hot<00:05:28.830> and<00:05:28.860> is<00:05:29.070> what<00:05:29.190> I've<00:05:29.280> noticed

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
gets really hot and is what I've noticed

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.820 
gets really hot and is what I've noticed

give you guys my final thoughts but here

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.890 
give you guys my final thoughts but here
is<00:05:39.480> the<00:05:39.870> waterproof<00:05:40.710> housing<00:05:41.120> 197<00:05:42.120> feet<00:05:42.150> deep

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
is the waterproof housing 197 feet deep

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.110 
is the waterproof housing 197 feet deep
submersion<00:05:43.680> that<00:05:44.100> means<00:05:44.310> you<00:05:44.430> can<00:05:44.580> drop<00:05:44.850> it<00:05:45.000> to

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
submersion that means you can drop it to

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.420 
submersion that means you can drop it to
the<00:05:45.150> bottom<00:05:45.420> of<00:05:45.510> a<00:05:45.570> pool<00:05:45.840> and<00:05:46.170> it<00:05:46.830> still<00:05:47.250> won't

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
the bottom of a pool and it still won't

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.310 
the bottom of a pool and it still won't
leak<00:05:47.760> and<00:05:48.000> I'm<00:05:48.420> sure<00:05:48.570> if<00:05:48.690> you<00:05:48.780> go<00:05:48.870> down<00:05:48.990> to<00:05:49.170> like

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
leak and I'm sure if you go down to like

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.930 
leak and I'm sure if you go down to like
a<00:05:49.410> hundred<00:05:49.770> and<00:05:49.860> ninety-seven<00:05:50.190> feet<00:05:50.580> it

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
a hundred and ninety-seven feet it

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.250 
a hundred and ninety-seven feet it
wouldn't<00:05:51.240> really<00:05:51.330> gather<00:05:51.570> but<00:05:51.870> anything

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
wouldn't really gather but anything
