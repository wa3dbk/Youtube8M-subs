make this to separate this joint we have
a<00:01:15.930> tie<00:01:16.170> rod<00:01:16.350> separator<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.760> basically

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
a tie rod separator and that basically

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.359 
a tie rod separator and that basically
goes<00:01:18.270> between<00:01:18.510> the<00:01:18.720> boot<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.440> our<00:01:19.979> spindle

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
with the tie rod end off you can see

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.180 
with the tie rod end off you can see
we've<00:01:35.970> disconnected<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.950> suspension<00:01:37.950> part

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190

we've disconnected the suspension part
of<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.340> car<00:01:38.550> okay<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.150> takes<00:01:39.240> care<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.510> this

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.940 
of the car okay that takes care of this
side<00:01:39.900> we'll<00:01:40.080> do<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.290> same<00:01:40.470> thing<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.830> the

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.130 
and secure the Mustang uses a pinch bolt
that<00:02:07.770> will<00:02:07.890> have<00:02:08.070> to<00:02:08.190> be<00:02:08.310> removed

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140

out
now<00:02:19.840> that<00:02:19.990> the<00:02:20.110> pinch<00:02:20.319> bolt<00:02:20.530> is<00:02:20.650> loose<00:02:20.890> I<00:02:21.160> use<00:02:21.670> a

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
now that the pinch bolt is loose I use a

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.340 
now that the pinch bolt is loose I use a
screwdriver<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.360> separate<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:22.959> pinion<00:02:23.319> shaft

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
screwdriver to separate the pinion shaft

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.080 
screwdriver to separate the pinion shaft
from<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.770> coupler<00:02:24.250> as<00:02:24.400> much<00:02:24.670> as<00:02:24.819> possible

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
from the coupler as much as possible

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.030 
from the coupler as much as possible
this<00:02:26.080> will<00:02:26.260> not<00:02:26.380> make<00:02:26.530> it<00:02:26.620> come<00:02:26.740> apart

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
this will not make it come apart

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.040 
this will not make it come apart
completely<00:02:27.670> but<00:02:28.300> it'll<00:02:28.420> get<00:02:28.600> it<00:02:28.720> started

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
completely but it'll get it started

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.690 
completely but it'll get it started
enough<00:02:29.350> to<00:02:29.560> make<00:02:29.709> getting<00:02:29.980> it<00:02:30.130> out<00:02:30.250> easier

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
enough to make getting it out easier

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.220 
enough to make getting it out easier
once<00:02:31.000> I<00:02:31.150> have<00:02:31.270> removed<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.630> rack<00:02:31.810> mounting
