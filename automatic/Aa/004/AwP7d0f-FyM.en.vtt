00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
within multiplayer so I'm going to break

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.860 
within multiplayer so I'm going to break
this<00:01:02.460> down<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.879> simplest<00:01:03.300> form<00:01:03.420> possible

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
this down to the simplest form possible

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.170 
this down to the simplest form possible
going<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.320> have<00:01:04.409> two<00:01:04.680> examples<00:01:05.129> here<00:01:05.610> the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
going to have two examples here the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.870 
going to have two examples here the
first<00:01:06.510> example<00:01:07.200> being<00:01:07.500> on<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.189> standard

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
first example being on the standard

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.490 
first example being on the standard
audio<00:01:09.060> settings<00:01:09.840> which<00:01:09.960> you're<00:01:10.110> seeing<00:01:10.290> on

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
audio settings which you're seeing on

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.350 
audio settings which you're seeing on
screen<00:01:10.530> here<00:01:10.979> all<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.700> sound<00:01:11.880> settings<00:01:12.119> are

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
screen here all the sound settings are

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.450 
screen here all the sound settings are
on<00:01:12.450> full<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:13.170> cod<00:01:13.350> caster<00:01:13.830> sound<00:01:14.010> settings<00:01:14.369> are

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
on full of cod caster sound settings are

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.240 
on full of cod caster sound settings are
irrelevant<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.110> we<00:01:16.110> are<00:01:16.259> on<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.710> tray<00:01:17.070> Ark

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
irrelevant and we are on the tray Ark

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.399 
irrelevant and we are on the tray Ark
mix<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:17.820> there's<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.180> standard<00:01:18.689> audio<00:01:18.869> settings

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
mix so there's a standard audio settings

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.780 
mix so there's a standard audio settings
which<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.619> get<00:01:19.770> when<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.040> first<00:01:20.070> put<00:01:20.549> black

which you get when you first put black

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.330 
which you get when you first put black
ops<00:01:21.000> 2<00:01:21.240> into<00:01:22.049> your<00:01:22.200> console<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.100> then<00:01:23.280> I'm

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.880 
sidewalk and hijacked I'm going to leave
your<00:01:27.270> audio<00:01:27.570> settings<00:01:27.810> exactly<00:01:28.560> as<00:01:28.650> they<00:01:28.770> were

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
your audio settings exactly as they were

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.130 
your audio settings exactly as they were
in<00:01:29.159> game<00:01:29.430> I'm<00:01:29.729> gonna<00:01:29.939> let<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.479> guys<00:01:30.689> see<00:01:31.020> if

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
in game I'm gonna let you guys see if

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.480 
in game I'm gonna let you guys see if
you<00:01:31.229> can<00:01:31.350> actually<00:01:31.470> hear<00:01:31.829> any<00:01:32.070> enemy

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
you can actually hear any enemy

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:42.719 
you can actually hear any enemy
footsteps

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.100 

so<00:01:43.729> you<00:01:43.939> can<00:01:44.060> hear<00:01:44.270> with<00:01:44.390> the<00:01:44.539> first<00:01:44.899> example

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
so you can hear with the first example

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.830 
so you can hear with the first example
you<00:01:45.560> simply<00:01:46.039> can't<00:01:46.340> hear<00:01:46.670> enemy<00:01:47.090> footsteps

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.639 
to produce the audio in game you simply

00:01:59.559 --> 00:01:59.569 
bits of audio that you want to hear

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:03.069 
bits of audio that you want to hear
within<00:02:00.079> the<00:02:00.770> game<00:02:01.100> sound<00:02:01.670> however<00:02:02.119> I've<00:02:02.719> gone

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
within the game sound however I've gone

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:04.749 
within the game sound however I've gone
to<00:02:03.289> all<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:03.469> sound<00:02:03.679> settings<00:02:04.100> fiddle<00:02:04.459> with

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
to all the sound settings fiddle with

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.100 
to all the sound settings fiddle with
everything<00:02:05.270> for<00:02:05.450> a<00:02:05.479> little<00:02:05.689> bit<00:02:05.840> and<00:02:06.049> I've

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
everything for a little bit and I've

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.449 
everything for a little bit and I've
actually<00:02:06.229> been<00:02:06.469> using<00:02:06.679> these<00:02:06.829> sound<00:02:07.069> settings

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
actually been using these sound settings

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:09.430 
actually been using these sound settings
pretty<00:02:08.030> much<00:02:08.179> since<00:02:08.450> launch<00:02:08.869> I<00:02:09.049> just<00:02:09.229> wasn't

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
pretty much since launch I just wasn't

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.080 
pretty much since launch I just wasn't
aware<00:02:09.829> that<00:02:09.890> so<00:02:10.220> many<00:02:10.310> people<00:02:10.610> didn't<00:02:10.910> realize

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
aware that so many people didn't realize

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.690 
aware that so many people didn't realize
that<00:02:11.450> you<00:02:11.569> could<00:02:11.720> have<00:02:12.019> such<00:02:12.769> greater<00:02:13.430> sound

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
that you could have such greater sound

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.250 
that you could have such greater sound
quality<00:02:14.150> and<00:02:14.239> pick<00:02:14.450> out<00:02:14.690> all<00:02:14.930> of<00:02:14.989> these<00:02:15.200> little

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
quality and pick out all of these little

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.890 
quality and pick out all of these little
sound<00:02:16.130> pieces<00:02:16.730> with<00:02:17.269> the<00:02:17.450> audio<00:02:17.690> settings

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
sound pieces with the audio settings

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.150 
sound pieces with the audio settings
that<00:02:18.079> I'm<00:02:18.200> using<00:02:18.440> so<00:02:18.620> I'm<00:02:18.799> going<00:02:18.950> to<00:02:18.980> go

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
that I'm using so I'm going to go

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.710 
that I'm using so I'm going to go
through<00:02:19.430> every<00:02:19.670> little<00:02:19.910> one<00:02:20.060> here<00:02:20.299> the<00:02:20.420> first

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
through every little one here the first

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.289 
through every little one here the first
one<00:02:20.989> being<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:21.799> actual<00:02:22.340> voice<00:02:22.700> volume<00:02:23.209> now

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
one being the actual voice volume now

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.210 
one being the actual voice volume now
voice<00:02:23.480> volume<00:02:23.780> I<00:02:24.110> wouldn't<00:02:24.769> turn<00:02:24.950> all<00:02:25.099> the<00:02:25.160> way

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
voice volume I wouldn't turn all the way

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.490 
voice volume I wouldn't turn all the way
down<00:02:25.400> to<00:02:25.489> the<00:02:25.579> bottom<00:02:25.910> it's<00:02:26.720> actually<00:02:27.200> fairly

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
down to the bottom it's actually fairly

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.289 
down to the bottom it's actually fairly
useful<00:02:27.769> when<00:02:28.160> an<00:02:28.280> enemy<00:02:28.459> says<00:02:28.940> something<00:02:29.269> like

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
useful when an enemy says something like

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.900 
useful when an enemy says something like
reloading<00:02:30.200> or<00:02:30.380> changing<00:02:30.890> mag<00:02:31.130> you<00:02:31.670> can

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
reloading or changing mag you can

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.670 
reloading or changing mag you can
actually<00:02:32.180> get<00:02:32.390> audio<00:02:32.780> cues<00:02:33.140> from<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.410> enemy's

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
actually get audio cues from the enemy's

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.350 
actually get audio cues from the enemy's
voices<00:02:34.160> and<00:02:34.370> that<00:02:34.519> can<00:02:34.700> alert<00:02:34.879> you<00:02:35.090> as<00:02:35.150> to

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
voices and that can alert you as to

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.569 
voices and that can alert you as to
where<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.660> enemy<00:02:35.780> is<00:02:35.959> the<00:02:36.680> music<00:02:37.040> volume<00:02:37.400> is

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
where the enemy is the music volume is

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.520 
where the enemy is the music volume is
pretty<00:02:38.090> much<00:02:38.209> useless<00:02:38.540> it's<00:02:39.079> just<00:02:39.290> there<00:02:39.410> to

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
pretty much useless it's just there to

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.309 
pretty much useless it's just there to
add<00:02:39.680> some<00:02:40.280> sort<00:02:40.489> of<00:02:40.549> atmospheric<00:02:41.299> feeling<00:02:41.959> but

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
add some sort of atmospheric feeling but

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:43.539 
add some sort of atmospheric feeling but
I<00:02:42.350> still<00:02:42.560> like<00:02:42.680> to<00:02:42.709> have<00:02:42.829> it<00:02:43.100> there<00:02:43.220> just<00:02:43.430> so

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
I still like to have it there just so

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:46.479 
I still like to have it there just so
the<00:02:43.700> sound<00:02:43.970> isn't<00:02:44.239> completely<00:02:44.660> bland<00:02:45.019> the<00:02:45.489> SFX

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
the sound isn't completely bland the SFX

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.789 
the sound isn't completely bland the SFX
volume<00:02:47.060> you<00:02:47.269> want<00:02:47.480> apfel<00:02:48.260> this<00:02:48.410> is<00:02:48.560> going<00:02:48.739> to

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
volume you want apfel this is going to

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.470 
volume you want apfel this is going to
be<00:02:48.950> for<00:02:49.430> picking<00:02:49.700> up<00:02:49.760> those<00:02:49.910> little<00:02:50.209> bits<00:02:50.389> of

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
be for picking up those little bits of

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.539 
be for picking up those little bits of
sounds<00:02:50.840> like<00:02:50.900> footsteps<00:02:51.620> or<00:02:51.889> the<00:02:52.130> reloading

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
sounds like footsteps or the reloading

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.819 
sounds like footsteps or the reloading
sound<00:02:52.940> keep<00:02:53.480> that<00:02:53.660> up<00:02:53.810> from<00:02:54.109> the<00:02:54.350> master

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 
sound keep that up from the master

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:56.620 
sound keep that up from the master
volume<00:02:54.950> you<00:02:55.519> then<00:02:55.700> want<00:02:55.940> to<00:02:56.090> lower<00:02:56.389> and

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
volume you then want to lower and

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:57.729 
volume you then want to lower and
there's<00:02:56.750> a<00:02:56.810> reason<00:02:57.139> why<00:02:57.260> you<00:02:57.319> want<00:02:57.440> to<00:02:57.590> lower

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
there's a reason why you want to lower

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.170 
there's a reason why you want to lower
the<00:02:57.889> master<00:02:58.250> master<00:02:58.730> volume<00:02:58.970> and<00:02:59.060> that's

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
the master master volume and that's

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.819 
the master master volume and that's
because<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.630> preset<00:03:00.139> we're<00:03:00.230> going<00:03:00.350> to<00:03:00.440> use<00:03:00.560> is

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
because the preset we're going to use is

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:02.830 
because the preset we're going to use is
super<00:03:01.459> crunch<00:03:01.670> and<00:03:01.819> super<00:03:02.180> crunch<00:03:02.359> basically

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
super crunch and super crunch basically

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.449 
super crunch and super crunch basically
increases<00:03:03.440> and<00:03:03.590> heightens<00:03:04.040> the<00:03:04.130> sound<00:03:04.340> of

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
increases and heightens the sound of

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.339 
increases and heightens the sound of
everything<00:03:05.000> in<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.180> game<00:03:05.329> to<00:03:05.840> make<00:03:05.930> it<00:03:05.989> really

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
everything in the game to make it really

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:07.599 
everything in the game to make it really
really<00:03:06.560> loud<00:03:06.680> but<00:03:06.829> what<00:03:06.980> we're<00:03:07.250> doing<00:03:07.519> is

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609 
really loud but what we're doing is

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:09.610 
really loud but what we're doing is
countering<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.239> super<00:03:08.569> crunch<00:03:08.780> so<00:03:09.380> that<00:03:09.500> the

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
countering the super crunch so that the

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.920 
countering the super crunch so that the
SFX<00:03:10.549> is<00:03:10.819> being<00:03:11.030> really<00:03:11.299> really<00:03:11.389> loud<00:03:11.660> but<00:03:11.840> the

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
SFX is being really really loud but the

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.099 
SFX is being really really loud but the
overall<00:03:12.470> volume<00:03:12.920> is<00:03:13.069> normal<00:03:13.790> so<00:03:14.389> the<00:03:14.569> sound<00:03:14.930> of

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
overall volume is normal so the sound of

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:16.809 
overall volume is normal so the sound of
the<00:03:15.200> footsteps<00:03:15.440> while<00:03:15.980> reloading<00:03:16.250> is<00:03:16.609> being

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
the footsteps while reloading is being

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.089 
the footsteps while reloading is being
heightened<00:03:17.359> as<00:03:17.450> much<00:03:17.780> as<00:03:17.989> possible<00:03:18.590> so<00:03:18.980> it's

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
heightened as much as possible so it's

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:20.710 
heightened as much as possible so it's
going<00:03:19.190> to<00:03:19.280> stand<00:03:19.579> out<00:03:19.760> from<00:03:19.819> everything<00:03:20.419> else
