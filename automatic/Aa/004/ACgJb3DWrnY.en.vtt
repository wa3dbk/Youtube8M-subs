00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.229 
happy so I think when she lost yeah yeah
she<00:02:06.200> just<00:02:06.350> got<00:02:06.530> very<00:02:06.590> very<00:02:07.130> mad<00:02:07.400> and<00:02:07.700> broke<00:02:08.030> a

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
she just got very very mad and broke a

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.490 
she just got very very mad and broke a
racket<00:02:08.630> yeah<00:02:08.989> or<00:02:09.560> maybe<00:02:09.679> it<00:02:09.890> slipped<00:02:11.320> maybe<00:02:12.320> it

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
racket yeah or maybe it slipped maybe it

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.320 
racket yeah or maybe it slipped maybe it
just<00:02:12.530> slipped<00:02:12.920> out<00:02:13.010> of<00:02:13.070> her<00:02:13.220> hand<00:02:13.459> so<00:02:13.910> I<00:02:13.940> guess

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
just slipped out of her hand so I guess

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.180
