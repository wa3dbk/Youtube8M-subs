00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.930
 Learn to master the position of the tiger 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:15.610
 the phoenix the turtle and the bear with sinking 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.610
 in the guide of champions 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.900
 power is a body combat champion to 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.970
 body with 11 skill is very 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.220
 particular unlike the others 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.260
 champions one has a skill 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.600
 definitively he has four skills 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.360
 among which you must decide that 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.660
 maximize since one of those four just 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.270
 may receive three points the liability is 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.970
 called monkey agility when adopting a 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.340
 Useful position earns 10% speed 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.650
 of attack and 5 speed of movement 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.270
 for a short period of time this 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.850
 effect can accumulate up to three 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.650
 perfect times to clean the jungle and 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.180
 pursue enemies all the skills 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.089
 to run away have a time of 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.040
 very short reuse and you need 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:00.050
 have control of when your 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.839
 skills to be able to take advantage of this 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.790
 effect pass the coesde the position of the 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:07.070
 tiger on activation increases speed 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.350
 of attack to flee for a few seconds 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.540
 the persistent effect is that the attacks 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.820
 Basic flee inflict additional damage 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.100
 and his first attack will inflict great 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.290
 amount of damage during the following 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.450
 two seconds a skill a little 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.620
 controversial popular when serving a 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.570
 lane but 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.310
 both when playing in the jungle is 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.740
 a very useful skill to kill the 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.720
 baron or the dragon even to the turrets 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.450
 but we'll talk a little about it 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.520
 later the w is the position of the 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.680
 turtle in activation you get a 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.110
 temporary shield that absorbs damage the 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.060
 persistent effect is that woody regenerates 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.010
 life by a percentage of the value of the 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.020
 damage inflicted is a shield and 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.390
 regeneration of life very useful in the 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.370
 jungle later during the game is a 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.680
 lifeguard in situations of fights in 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.630
 team can make a character flee 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.830
 with the resistance of a tank 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.680
 appropriate 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.300
 lae is the position of the bear in activation 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.400
 the movement speed of running away 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.560
 increases the effect for a short time 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.780
 persistent is that the basic attacks 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.030
 to flee stun the target during a 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.429
 second this effect can not be applied 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.560
 to the same objective more than once each 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.720
 several seconds is not necessary 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.820
 EPE to revive paralyze 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.710
 an enemy you just have to wait 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.990
 those six seconds is the skill 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.820
 perfect to get away or catch a 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.600
 enemy generally when I have the 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.060
 blue 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.010
 I want to have 100% active stability 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.610
 of time this with speed boots 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.980
 of movement 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.690
 they allow you to cover all the lanes and 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.280
 offer help to colleagues who 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.470
 they need the speed of movement 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.390
 combined with the ability to stun 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.810
 your enemy make this the skill 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.100
 perfect for ambushes 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.260
 finally the air that is not a 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.110
 definite skill is called position 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.970
 of the phoenix in activation odihr emits 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.980
 waves of fire that inflict damage on 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.290
 nearby enemies for five seconds 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.000
 the persistent effect is that with the 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.790
 first attack and every three attacks 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.680
 after this power wrapped in flames 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.140
 to the enemies that are in front of him 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.500
 the rr its main damage ability in 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.209
 the jungle and at the time of the ambushes 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.010
 if we are going to go to the jungle generally 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:15.290
 it is preferred to maximize the position of the 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:17.270
 phoenix turtle and bear in that order leaving 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.760
 the three points for the tiger's 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.440
 final if we think play with sinking in the 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.360
 top lane then we could 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.550
 start maximizing the position of 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.840
 tiger although this guide is going to focus 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.670
 in the jungle 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.770
 we must understand a couple of things like 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.540
 see the first one is that you are not a tank 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.640
 natural you do not have any skill that 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.330
 reduce the damage you receive the only thing that 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.040
 it makes you a 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.960
 how partial is the position of the 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.910
 turtle so let's depend a lot 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.040
 of our objects if we want to be the 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.470
 equipment tank what is special 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.240
 audere its high mobility is one of the 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.340
 characters harder to catch 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.710
 as long as you have the blue or once 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.960
 finished your spiritual stone can you 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:56.660
 afford to constantly use 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.220
 the position of the bear this in conjunction with 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.470
 movement speed boots and 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.720
 ghost will give you a very presence 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.150
 strong on the map for example you can 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.160
 ambush the center lane and seconds 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.900
 after that you can make a presence in 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.120
 the upper or lower rail 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.620
 many times the enemy will not tell 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.540
 with the speed with which you can 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.459
 appear in your career the weakness more 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.769
 important to flee is its short range 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.959
 It needs to be stuck to the face of 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.790
 enemy constantly and during 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.340
 team fights is incredibly 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.740
 difficult for him to enter directly 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.120
 over the line after being an enemy so 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.610
 we must play more 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.950
 smart such braking to 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.170
 the enemy frontal line to get to 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.360
 our to carry or use our 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:40.490
 speed to maneuver around the 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.600
 enemy team until you reach the line 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.240
 back all 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.310
 of the situation definitely the point 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.100
 the strongest of running away are the ambushes 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.840
 this character can be a terror in 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.610
 combination with champions who have 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.010
 some kind of control over the enemy 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.110
 as for example darius who can 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.360
 pull the enemy who tries to escape 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.820
 so that later it paraly a couple of 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.440
 times with the position of the bear already with your 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.840
 speed boots and with the help of 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.580
 ghost any enemy that does not count 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.580
 with flash is an easy prey 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.360
 for runes we want to go with brands of 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:19.540
 attack speed armor seals 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.580
 glyphs magic resistance and kits 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.340
 magical or penetration speed 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.169
 movement defensive masters with 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.660
 nine points offensive to the 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:30.580
 extra magic penetration for spells 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.850
 of summoner we will take punishment and 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.919
 ghost or punishment and flash the 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.139
 objects are designed to offer you 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:40.090
 audi early mana regeneration together 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:42.550
 with reduced waiting time 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.310
 their skills as well as offering something of 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.800
 support to the team we started machete and 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.449
 potions the machete becomes the 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.370
 spiritual stone that ends 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:54.220
 turning into the spirit of the golem 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:56.590
 ancestral and the aegis of the 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.750
 legion as well as the omen of rand wins 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.699
 all these objects in some way or 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.410
 another offer life and reduction in the 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:05.320
 Cooling hate skills 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:07.630
 for boots we can go with the classic tavi 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.520
 of ninja or sorcerer's boots but 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.199
 we could also opt for the boots of 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.620
 movement speed for a 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:16.419
 fun and unforgettable experience this 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.950
 has been all for the guide to flee not 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:19.810
 forget to leave us your opinions 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.550
 in the comments if it will continue radio 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.860
 you have latin america on your page 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:27.270
 facebook as always I was a skater and 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.270
 see you until next time
