for<00:00:02.700> another<00:00:02.910> mod<00:00:03.120> video<00:00:03.450> this<00:00:03.810> one's<00:00:04.080> a<00:00:04.200> small

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
for another mod video this one's a small

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.380 
for another mod video this one's a small
one<00:00:04.680> but<00:00:04.799> it's<00:00:04.950> a<00:00:05.129> very<00:00:05.490> awesome<00:00:05.759> one<00:00:06.089> diode

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
one but it's a very awesome one diode

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.930 
one but it's a very awesome one diode
dynamics<00:00:07.049> was<00:00:07.229> very<00:00:07.559> kind<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:08.069> send<00:00:08.370> me<00:00:08.490> some

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
dynamics was very kind to send me some

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.140 
dynamics was very kind to send me some
of<00:00:09.030> their<00:00:09.300> interior<00:00:10.260> and<00:00:10.530> reverse<00:00:11.220> LEDs<00:00:11.850> that

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
of their interior and reverse LEDs that

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.300 
of their interior and reverse LEDs that
they<00:00:12.270> have<00:00:12.510> and<00:00:13.170> then<00:00:13.320> do<00:00:13.470> LEDs<00:00:13.800> for<00:00:13.950> all<00:00:14.040> kinds

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:14.310 
they have and then do LEDs for all kinds

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.590 
they have and then do LEDs for all kinds
of<00:00:14.340> stuff<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:14.580> had<00:00:14.760> them<00:00:14.880> back<00:00:15.030> when<00:00:15.269> I<00:00:15.330> had<00:00:15.450> my

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:15.600 
of stuff I had them back when I had my

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.900 
of stuff I had them back when I had my
BRZ<00:00:16.049> I<00:00:16.080> had<00:00:16.350> them<00:00:16.560> on<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:17.070> interior<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:17.700> that

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
BRZ I had them on the interior of that

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.420 
BRZ I had them on the interior of that
and<00:00:18.210> they<00:00:18.930> do<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.200> Mustang<00:00:19.410> video<00:00:19.980> all<00:00:20.100> kinds

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
and they do the Mustang video all kinds

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.160 
and they do the Mustang video all kinds
of<00:00:20.490> stuff<00:00:20.700> so<00:00:20.820> check<00:00:20.850> out<00:00:21.119> their<00:00:21.300> website<00:00:21.750> and

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
of stuff so check out their website and

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.480 
of stuff so check out their website and
be<00:00:22.350> sure<00:00:22.500> I'm<00:00:22.680> gonna<00:00:22.830> give<00:00:23.070> them<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.280> like

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
be sure I'm gonna give them a like

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.880 
be sure I'm gonna give them a like
follow<00:00:23.910> I'd<00:00:24.780> really<00:00:25.320> appreciate<00:00:25.440> them

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
follow I'd really appreciate them

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.189 
follow I'd really appreciate them
hooking<00:00:26.160> me<00:00:26.279> up<00:00:26.310> with<00:00:26.490> these<00:00:26.670> LEDs<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.330> they

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
hooking me up with these LEDs and they

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.019 
hooking me up with these LEDs and they
also<00:00:28.350> have<00:00:28.560> very<00:00:28.590> cool<00:00:28.920> switchback<00:00:29.460> LEDs<00:00:29.880> for

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
also have very cool switchback LEDs for

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.640 
also have very cool switchback LEDs for
the<00:00:30.119> front<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.869> Mustang<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.440> the<00:00:31.500> turn

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
the front of the Mustang of the turn

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.860 
the front of the Mustang of the turn
signal<00:00:31.980> area<00:00:32.160> but<00:00:32.820> I'm<00:00:33.270> waiting<00:00:33.600> for<00:00:33.630> the

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
signal area but I'm waiting for the

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.510 
signal area but I'm waiting for the
plug-and-play<00:00:34.079> resistors<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:34.980> they<00:00:35.130> are

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
plug-and-play resistors that they are

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.049 
plug-and-play resistors that they are
developing<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.180> will<00:00:36.870> prevent<00:00:37.290> the

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
developing that will prevent the

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.610 
developing that will prevent the
interior<00:00:39.059> turn<00:00:39.630> signal<00:00:39.989> part<00:00:40.140> from<00:00:40.290> blinking

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
interior turn signal part from blinking

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.080 
interior turn signal part from blinking
too<00:00:40.739> quickly<00:00:41.040> because<00:00:41.309> those<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.700> know<00:00:41.820> kind

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
too quickly because those you know kind

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.670 
too quickly because those you know kind
of<00:00:42.120> blink<00:00:42.390> too<00:00:42.540> fast<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.530> need<00:00:43.649> a

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
of blink too fast and so you need a

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.080 
of blink too fast and so you need a
resistor<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.309> there<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.700> doesn't<00:00:44.850> do<00:00:45.059> that

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
resistor in there so it doesn't do that

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.010 
resistor in there so it doesn't do that
but<00:00:45.870> so<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:47.010> have<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.489> interior<00:00:47.969> LEDs<00:00:48.390> here<00:00:48.780> and

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
but so I have the interior LEDs here and

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.740 
but so I have the interior LEDs here and
I<00:00:49.200> also<00:00:49.380> have<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:50.070> reverse<00:00:50.430> LEDs<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:51.450> I'm<00:00:51.570> just

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
I also have the reverse LEDs so I'm just

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:52.940 
I also have the reverse LEDs so I'm just
gonna<00:00:51.870> show<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.140> guys<00:00:52.290> what<00:00:52.620> comes<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:52.890> the

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
gonna show you guys what comes in the

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.639 
gonna show you guys what comes in the
box<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.520> if<00:00:54.059> they're<00:00:54.420> super<00:00:54.870> easy<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.200> install

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
box and if they're super easy to install

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.709 
box and if they're super easy to install
so<00:00:55.950> I'll<00:00:56.070> show<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.280> real<00:00:56.550> quickly<00:00:56.820> how<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.450> pop

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
so I'll show you real quickly how to pop

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.690 
so I'll show you real quickly how to pop
them<00:00:57.899> all<00:00:58.020> in<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.559> what<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.190> think<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.550> them

00:00:59.690 --> 00:00:59.700 
them all in and what I think of them

I kind of stuff a little cardboard stuff

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.570 
I kind of stuff a little cardboard stuff
here<00:01:07.080> setting<00:01:07.470> doesn't<00:01:07.650> jostle<00:01:08.220> around<00:01:08.250> too

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
here setting doesn't jostle around too

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.060 
here setting doesn't jostle around too
much<00:01:08.729> got<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.090> nice<00:01:09.299> daya<00:01:10.049> dynamic<00:01:10.710> sticker

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
much got a nice daya dynamic sticker

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.469 
much got a nice daya dynamic sticker
here<00:01:12.020> this<00:01:13.020> one<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.619> reverse<00:01:13.950> one<00:01:14.340> it's<00:01:15.330> a

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
here this one is the reverse one it's a

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.899 
here this one is the reverse one it's a
you<00:01:16.200> know<00:01:16.260> they're<00:01:16.439> nice<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.710> big<00:01:17.159> it's<00:01:17.729> like

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
you know they're nice and big it's like

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.609 
you know they're nice and big it's like
twice<00:01:18.240> as<00:01:18.420> bright<00:01:18.689> as<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.960> regular<00:01:19.260> backup

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
twice as bright as the regular backup

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.410 
twice as bright as the regular backup
light<00:01:19.799> which<00:01:20.010> is<00:01:20.130> awesome<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.790> there's<00:01:21.330> a

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
light which is awesome and there's a

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.469 
light which is awesome and there's a
nice<00:01:21.600> little<00:01:21.780> box<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.439> here<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:24.470> as<00:01:26.299> the<00:01:27.299> other

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
nice little box in here and as the other

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.130 
nice little box in here and as the other
ones<00:01:27.750> here<00:01:28.170> for<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.470> interior<00:01:29.509> so<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.869> don't

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
ones here for the interior so I don't

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.960 
ones here for the interior so I don't
know<00:01:31.229> which<00:01:31.439> ones<00:01:31.650> go<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.890> which<00:01:32.100> just<00:01:32.460> yet<00:01:32.729> but

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
know which ones go to which just yet but

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.060 
know which ones go to which just yet but
I'll<00:01:33.150> figure<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.869> all<00:01:33.990> out<00:01:34.049> very<00:01:34.439> soon<00:01:34.740> here

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
I'll figure it all out very soon here

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.740 
I'll figure it all out very soon here
but<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:36.060> we<00:01:36.299> got<00:01:37.640> few<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.790> smaller<00:01:39.119> ones<00:01:39.479> for

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
but so we got few the smaller ones for

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.350 
but so we got few the smaller ones for
you<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.049> bigger<00:01:40.259> ones<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:41.820> these<00:01:42.119> ones

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
you the bigger ones and so these ones

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.390 
you the bigger ones and so these ones
will<00:01:42.540> go<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.960> map<00:01:43.200> lights<00:01:43.560> we'll<00:01:43.860> also<00:01:44.009> put

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
will go in the map lights we'll also put

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.850 
will go in the map lights we'll also put
them<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.210> glove<00:01:45.509> box<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.530> trunk

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
them in the glove box and in the trunk

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.590 
them in the glove box and in the trunk
we're<00:01:47.460> also<00:01:47.579> gonna<00:01:47.759> be<00:01:47.909> swapping<00:01:48.119> out<00:01:48.270> all<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
we're also gonna be swapping out all the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.030 
we're also gonna be swapping out all the
vanity<00:01:48.990> mirror<00:01:49.020> lights<00:01:49.409> as<00:01:49.560> well<00:01:49.710> that's<00:01:49.890> what

vanity mirror lights as well that's what

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.550 
vanity mirror lights as well that's what
these<00:01:50.159> little<00:01:50.310> ones<00:01:50.610> here<00:01:50.909> for<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:51.900> it's<00:01:52.200> full

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
these little ones here for so it's full

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.980 
these little ones here for so it's full
LED<00:01:52.799> conversion<00:01:53.579> very<00:01:54.270> cool<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:54.720> let's<00:01:54.750> go

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
LED conversion very cool so let's go

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.810 
LED conversion very cool so let's go
install<00:01:55.320> them<00:01:55.500> alright<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:56.430> first<00:01:56.579> we'll

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
install them alright so first we'll

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.819 
install them alright so first we'll
start<00:01:57.000> with<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.180> glove<00:01:57.390> box<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:58.020> as<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.740> can

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
start with the glove box and as you can

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.920 
start with the glove box and as you can
see<00:01:58.890> it's<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.159> very<00:01:59.189> yellow<00:01:59.759> typical<00:02:00.630> kind<00:02:00.869> of

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
see it's a very yellow typical kind of

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.039 
see it's a very yellow typical kind of
light<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.170> comes<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.770> cars<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.549> so<00:02:03.509> this<00:02:03.869> one

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
light that comes in cars and so this one

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.600 
light that comes in cars and so this one
you<00:02:04.170> can<00:02:04.290> use<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.439> flathead<00:02:04.740> screwdriver<00:02:04.920> or

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
you can use a flathead screwdriver or

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.069 
you can use a flathead screwdriver or
your<00:02:05.790> finger<00:02:06.119> flathead<00:02:06.509> screwdrivers

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
your finger flathead screwdrivers

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.379 
your finger flathead screwdrivers
probably<00:02:07.560> best<00:02:07.770> very<00:02:08.069> small<00:02:08.369> just<00:02:08.849> pop<00:02:09.059> it<00:02:09.239> out

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:09.389 
probably best very small just pop it out

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:11.780 
probably best very small just pop it out
it's<00:02:09.719> very<00:02:10.019> easy<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.619> as<00:02:11.069> you<00:02:11.219> can<00:02:11.340> see<00:02:11.519> looks

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
it's very easy and as you can see looks

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.780 
it's very easy and as you can see looks
much<00:02:12.059> better<00:02:12.269> with

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
much better with

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.199 
much better with
the<00:02:12.930> new<00:02:13.930> white<00:02:14.439> light<00:02:15.159> next<00:02:15.700> is<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.879> vanity

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
the new white light next is the vanity

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.490 
the new white light next is the vanity
mirror<00:02:16.239> lights<00:02:16.689> which<00:02:16.930> are<00:02:17.079> probably<00:02:17.290> the

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
mirror lights which are probably the

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.830 
mirror lights which are probably the
most<00:02:17.650> difficult<00:02:17.890> ones<00:02:18.340> of<00:02:18.519> all<00:02:18.670> so<00:02:19.569> you<00:02:19.659> just

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
most difficult ones of all so you just

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.050 
most difficult ones of all so you just
need<00:02:19.959> a<00:02:19.989> tiny<00:02:20.079> little<00:02:20.799> flathead<00:02:21.159> to<00:02:21.700> get

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
need a tiny little flathead to get

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.869 
need a tiny little flathead to get
behind<00:02:22.209> the<00:02:22.780> lens<00:02:23.019> there<00:02:23.409> and<00:02:23.620> pop<00:02:24.579> them<00:02:24.760> out

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
behind the lens there and pop them out

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.030 
behind the lens there and pop them out
just<00:02:25.840> be<00:02:25.959> careful<00:02:26.319> you<00:02:26.349> don't<00:02:26.500> break<00:02:26.680> them<00:02:26.920> of

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
just be careful you don't break them of

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.009 
just be careful you don't break them of
course<00:02:27.280> but<00:02:28.209> with<00:02:28.359> a<00:02:28.390> little<00:02:28.659> bit<00:02:28.750> of<00:02:28.840> wiggling

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
course but with a little bit of wiggling

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.130 
course but with a little bit of wiggling
they<00:02:29.470> come<00:02:29.739> right<00:02:29.980> off<00:02:30.040> there<00:02:30.579> and<00:02:31.049> you<00:02:32.049> know

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
they come right off there and you know

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.179 
they come right off there and you know
you<00:02:32.230> gotta<00:02:32.379> do<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.590> same<00:02:32.739> for<00:02:32.859> the<00:02:32.980> other<00:02:33.099> side

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:33.189 
you gotta do the same for the other side

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:36.899 
you gotta do the same for the other side
and<00:02:34.140> just<00:02:35.140> a<00:02:35.379> little<00:02:35.980> bit<00:02:36.099> of<00:02:36.189> wiggling<00:02:36.340> is<00:02:36.700> all

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:36.909 
and just a little bit of wiggling is all

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.640 
and just a little bit of wiggling is all
it<00:02:37.030> takes<00:02:37.269> and<00:02:37.620> eventually<00:02:38.620> comes<00:02:38.859> right<00:02:39.099> off

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
it takes and eventually comes right off

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.580 
it takes and eventually comes right off
and<00:02:41.150> then<00:02:42.150> you<00:02:42.840> use<00:02:42.989> that<00:02:43.019> same<00:02:43.379> little

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
and then you use that same little

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.580 
and then you use that same little
flathead<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.220> pop<00:02:44.519> the<00:02:44.879> little<00:02:45.690> bulbs<00:02:46.080> out<00:02:46.319> and

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
flathead to pop the little bulbs out and

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.280 
flathead to pop the little bulbs out and
um<00:02:46.980> me<00:02:47.790> whenever<00:02:48.060> I<00:02:48.269> tried<00:02:48.599> popping<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.019> bulbs

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
um me whenever I tried popping the bulbs

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.229 
um me whenever I tried popping the bulbs
out<00:02:49.440> they<00:02:49.590> actually<00:02:49.920> slid<00:02:50.400> behind<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.970> mirror

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
out they actually slid behind the mirror

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.320 
out they actually slid behind the mirror
there<00:02:51.690> so<00:02:52.340> fortunately<00:02:53.340> it's<00:02:53.909> very<00:02:54.060> easy<00:02:54.239> to

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
there so fortunately it's very easy to

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.030 
there so fortunately it's very easy to
take<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.540> mirror<00:02:54.690> off<00:02:54.930> it's<00:02:55.140> just<00:02:55.349> two<00:02:55.590> screws

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
take the mirror off it's just two screws

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.649 
take the mirror off it's just two screws
and<00:02:56.340> so<00:02:56.610> I<00:02:56.640> just<00:02:57.000> went<00:02:57.180> ahead<00:02:57.269> and<00:02:57.420> just

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
and so I just went ahead and just

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.930 
and so I just went ahead and just
unscrewed<00:02:58.079> the<00:02:58.170> whole<00:02:58.319> mirror<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:58.940> pulled

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
unscrewed the whole mirror and pulled

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.630 
unscrewed the whole mirror and pulled
that<00:03:00.060> right<00:03:00.120> off<00:03:00.510> very<00:03:00.870> easily<00:03:01.079> and<00:03:01.640> retrieved

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
that right off very easily and retrieved

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.819 
that right off very easily and retrieved
those<00:03:02.879> little<00:03:03.569> bulbs<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.170> then<00:03:04.379> while<00:03:04.590> it<00:03:04.709> was

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
those little bulbs and then while it was

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.520 
those little bulbs and then while it was
off<00:03:05.040> I<00:03:05.310> just<00:03:05.340> decided<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:05.909> pop<00:03:06.120> in<00:03:06.329> the<00:03:06.599> LEDs

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
off I just decided to pop in the LEDs

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.740 
off I just decided to pop in the LEDs
you<00:03:07.829> know<00:03:07.920> one<00:03:08.069> for<00:03:08.280> each<00:03:08.340> side<00:03:08.610> and<00:03:08.879> if<00:03:09.569> they

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
you know one for each side and if they

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.420 
you know one for each side and if they
don't<00:03:09.870> work<00:03:10.140> you<00:03:10.319> can<00:03:10.440> spin<00:03:10.650> them<00:03:10.709> around<00:03:10.769> but

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
don't work you can spin them around but

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.849 
don't work you can spin them around but
I<00:03:11.459> think<00:03:11.579> they<00:03:11.819> should<00:03:11.849> work<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.299> first<00:03:12.540> time

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:12.859 
I think they should work the first time

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.140 
I think they should work the first time
and<00:03:13.859> one<00:03:14.040> thing<00:03:14.069> to<00:03:14.280> note<00:03:14.519> if<00:03:14.670> you<00:03:14.760> do<00:03:14.879> take<00:03:15.030> the

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
and one thing to note if you do take the

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.420 
and one thing to note if you do take the
mirror<00:03:15.299> off<00:03:15.480> like<00:03:15.629> I<00:03:15.780> did<00:03:16.049> the<00:03:16.709> little<00:03:16.859> trigger

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
mirror off like I did the little trigger

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.880 
mirror off like I did the little trigger
to<00:03:17.910> illuminate<00:03:18.510> them<00:03:18.660> won't<00:03:18.930> come<00:03:19.530> on<00:03:19.560> unless

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
to illuminate them won't come on unless

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.640 
to illuminate them won't come on unless
you<00:03:20.129> manually<00:03:20.579> put<00:03:20.940> it<00:03:21.030> on<00:03:21.150> so<00:03:21.780> but<00:03:22.079> with<00:03:22.410> the

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650

easily and just swap them out for the

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.140 
easily and just swap them out for the
better<00:03:57.870> bulbs<00:03:58.379> and<00:03:58.590> so<00:03:59.430> nice<00:03:59.730> and<00:03:59.760> easy<00:03:59.910> thing

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
better bulbs and so nice and easy thing

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.390 
better bulbs and so nice and easy thing
just<00:04:00.299> pops<00:04:00.510> right<00:04:00.629> back<00:04:00.989> in<00:04:01.230> and<00:04:01.440> these<00:04:02.310> are

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
just pops right back in and these are

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.640 
just pops right back in and these are
how<00:04:02.819> it<00:04:02.940> looks<00:04:03.120> before<00:04:03.359> with<00:04:04.019> the<00:04:04.169> yellowish

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
how it looks before with the yellowish

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.650 
how it looks before with the yellowish
light<00:04:04.980> and<00:04:05.760> then<00:04:05.849> how<00:04:06.000> it<00:04:06.090> illuminates<00:04:06.269> the

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
light and then how it illuminates the

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.819 
light and then how it illuminates the
cabin<00:04:07.109> here<00:04:07.500> and<00:04:08.780> so<00:04:09.780> I<00:04:09.810> mean<00:04:10.139> it<00:04:10.290> you<00:04:10.560> know<00:04:10.590> it

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
cabin here and so I mean it you know it

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.559 
cabin here and so I mean it you know it
does<00:04:10.859> a<00:04:11.040> decent<00:04:11.340> job<00:04:11.730> but<00:04:11.790> it's<00:04:12.180> just<00:04:12.269> all<00:04:12.449> that

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
does a decent job but it's just all that

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.180 
does a decent job but it's just all that
yellowy<00:04:12.959> kind<00:04:13.290> of<00:04:13.440> light<00:04:13.620> aside<00:04:13.919> from<00:04:14.069> the

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
yellowy kind of light aside from the

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.069 
yellowy kind of light aside from the
footwells<00:04:14.549> which<00:04:14.790> were<00:04:14.910> blue<00:04:15.180> and<00:04:15.419> then<00:04:15.900> you

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
footwells which were blue and then you

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.189 
footwells which were blue and then you
know<00:04:16.199> with<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.650> new<00:04:17.180> LEDs<00:04:18.180> nice<00:04:18.690> and<00:04:18.989> white

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
know with the new LEDs nice and white

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:20.960 
know with the new LEDs nice and white
just<00:04:19.530> brightens<00:04:20.070> everything<00:04:20.130> up<00:04:20.400> so<00:04:20.699> much

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
just brightens everything up so much

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.050 
just brightens everything up so much
better<00:04:21.269> and<00:04:21.830> so<00:04:22.830> just<00:04:23.099> really<00:04:23.460> completes<00:04:23.940> the

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
better and so just really completes the

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.610 
better and so just really completes the
look<00:04:24.150> and<00:04:24.479> it<00:04:24.599> really<00:04:24.660> makes<00:04:25.020> it<00:04:25.110> look<00:04:25.169> great

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
look and it really makes it look great

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.650 
look and it really makes it look great
next<00:04:26.340> is<00:04:26.580> the<00:04:26.669> trunk<00:04:26.940> light<00:04:27.120> here<00:04:27.330> which<00:04:27.479> is<00:04:27.630> a

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
next is the trunk light here which is a

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.370 
next is the trunk light here which is a
little<00:04:27.840> tricky

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
little tricky

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.500 
little tricky
I<00:04:28.530> had<00:04:29.130> to<00:04:29.250> kind<00:04:29.490> of<00:04:29.520> do<00:04:29.820> something<00:04:30.030> angling

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
I had to kind of do something angling

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.360 
I had to kind of do something angling
with<00:04:30.690> my<00:04:30.900> flat-head<00:04:31.650> screwdriver<00:04:31.680> there<00:04:32.250> to

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
with my flat-head screwdriver there to

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.189 
with my flat-head screwdriver there to
get<00:04:32.520> it<00:04:32.639> out<00:04:32.760> but<00:04:32.970> it<00:04:33.060> finally<00:04:33.300> comes<00:04:33.630> out<00:04:33.840> you

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
get it out but it finally comes out you

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:35.540 
get it out but it finally comes out you
want<00:04:34.380> to<00:04:34.410> unplug<00:04:34.800> the<00:04:34.949> whole<00:04:35.099> thing<00:04:35.370> because

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
want to unplug the whole thing because

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.820 
want to unplug the whole thing because
it's<00:04:35.699> pretty<00:04:36.000> easy<00:04:36.090> to<00:04:36.270> short<00:04:36.570> out<00:04:36.690> the

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
it's pretty easy to short out the

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.110 
it's pretty easy to short out the
connection<00:04:37.830> there<00:04:38.039> if<00:04:38.639> you<00:04:38.820> do<00:04:38.970> it<00:04:39.060> without

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
connection there if you do it without

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.120 
connection there if you do it without
unplugging<00:04:39.449> but<00:04:39.870> super<00:04:40.169> easy<00:04:40.320> just<00:04:40.410> unplug

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
unplugging but super easy just unplug

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.670 
unplugging but super easy just unplug
that<00:04:41.160> little<00:04:41.580> clip<00:04:41.820> and<00:04:42.349> it's<00:04:43.349> going<00:04:43.530> to<00:04:43.620> be

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
that little clip and it's going to be

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.020 
that little clip and it's going to be
really<00:04:43.949> hot<00:04:44.220> all<00:04:44.370> these<00:04:44.520> bulbs<00:04:44.729> are<00:04:44.820> going<00:04:44.970> to

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
really hot all these bulbs are going to

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.879 
really hot all these bulbs are going to
be<00:04:45.090> really<00:04:45.330> hot<00:04:45.539> so<00:04:46.199> you<00:04:46.289> just<00:04:46.440> pop<00:04:46.620> them<00:04:46.830> out

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
be really hot so you just pop them out

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:50.300 
be really hot so you just pop them out
with<00:04:47.430> a<00:04:47.490> little<00:04:47.729> screwdriver<00:04:47.970> and<00:04:49.219> then<00:04:50.219> you

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
with a little screwdriver and then you

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.670 
with a little screwdriver and then you
just<00:04:50.520> pop<00:04:50.700> the<00:04:50.969> new<00:04:51.599> LED<00:04:51.930> a<00:04:52.080> nice<00:04:52.500> thing<00:04:52.650> about

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
just pop the new LED a nice thing about

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.839 
just pop the new LED a nice thing about
the<00:04:52.860> diode<00:04:53.130> dynamics<00:04:53.550> is

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:53.849 
the diode dynamics is

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:56.149 
the diode dynamics is
some<00:04:54.029> work<00:04:54.419> both<00:04:55.020> ways<00:04:55.319> so<00:04:55.709> you<00:04:55.770> don't<00:04:56.009> have<00:04:56.069> to

00:04:56.149 --> 00:04:56.159 
some work both ways so you don't have to

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:57.350 
some work both ways so you don't have to
keep<00:04:56.279> spinning<00:04:56.639> them<00:04:56.759> around<00:04:56.939> like<00:04:57.149> other

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
keep spinning them around like other

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.679 
keep spinning them around like other
LEDs<00:04:58.399> so<00:04:59.399> you<00:04:59.459> just<00:04:59.699> plug<00:04:59.969> it<00:04:59.999> right<00:05:00.209> back<00:05:00.449> in

00:05:00.679 --> 00:05:00.689 
LEDs so you just plug it right back in

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:02.419 
LEDs so you just plug it right back in
and<00:05:00.899> you'll<00:05:01.080> see<00:05:01.169> it's<00:05:01.619> already<00:05:01.740> a<00:05:01.979> nice<00:05:02.189> white

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:02.429 
and you'll see it's already a nice white

00:05:02.429 --> 00:05:05.029 
and you'll see it's already a nice white
light<00:05:02.729> and<00:05:02.999> then<00:05:03.509> just<00:05:03.869> pop<00:05:04.409> it<00:05:04.559> back<00:05:04.589> in<00:05:05.009> and

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
light and then just pop it back in and

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:07.549 
light and then just pop it back in and
you<00:05:05.699> know<00:05:05.789> kind<00:05:05.999> of<00:05:06.029> make<00:05:06.179> sure<00:05:06.209> you<00:05:06.569> jostle<00:05:07.499> it

00:05:07.549 --> 00:05:07.559 
you know kind of make sure you jostle it

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:09.139 
you know kind of make sure you jostle it
around<00:05:07.800> a<00:05:07.949> little<00:05:08.039> bit<00:05:08.249> so<00:05:08.520> that<00:05:08.550> it's<00:05:08.819> in

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:09.149 
around a little bit so that it's in

00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:11.419 
around a little bit so that it's in
there<00:05:09.270> nice<00:05:09.449> and<00:05:09.479> firm<00:05:09.929> and<00:05:10.199> then<00:05:11.099> you're<00:05:11.309> all

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:11.429 
there nice and firm and then you're all

00:05:11.429 --> 00:05:12.709 
there nice and firm and then you're all
set<00:05:11.459> and<00:05:11.759> so<00:05:11.969> this<00:05:12.089> is<00:05:12.209> how<00:05:12.300> it<00:05:12.389> looks<00:05:12.539> before

00:05:12.709 --> 00:05:12.719 
set and so this is how it looks before

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:14.329 
set and so this is how it looks before
you<00:05:13.139> can<00:05:13.289> hardly<00:05:13.469> even<00:05:13.740> see<00:05:13.860> that<00:05:14.129> there's<00:05:14.279> a

00:05:14.329 --> 00:05:14.339 
you can hardly even see that there's a

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:17.689 
you can hardly even see that there's a
light<00:05:14.550> on<00:05:14.580> it's<00:05:14.969> a<00:05:15.059> very<00:05:15.300> dim<00:05:15.599> light<00:05:15.869> and<00:05:16.699> so

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 
light on it's a very dim light and so

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:19.969 
light on it's a very dim light and so
it's<00:05:17.849> a<00:05:17.909> big<00:05:18.119> upgrade<00:05:18.270> to<00:05:18.659> putting<00:05:19.020> in<00:05:19.259> the<00:05:19.469> new

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 
it's a big upgrade to putting in the new

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:21.829 
it's a big upgrade to putting in the new
one<00:05:20.189> here<00:05:20.429> nice<00:05:20.639> and<00:05:20.879> white<00:05:21.059> and<00:05:21.300> brightens

00:05:21.829 --> 00:05:21.839 
one here nice and white and brightens

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:24.739 
one here nice and white and brightens
everything<00:05:21.959> up<00:05:22.229> a<00:05:22.349> whole<00:05:22.529> lot<00:05:22.849> and<00:05:23.849> lastly<00:05:24.479> the

00:05:24.739 --> 00:05:24.749 
everything up a whole lot and lastly the

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:27.309 
everything up a whole lot and lastly the
reverse<00:05:25.110> light<00:05:25.439> here<00:05:25.770> so<00:05:25.800> there's<00:05:26.699> just<00:05:26.789> a

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:27.319 
reverse light here so there's just a

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:29.809 
reverse light here so there's just a
connector<00:05:28.319> right<00:05:28.529> underneath<00:05:28.889> the<00:05:29.279> car<00:05:29.519> and

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:29.819 
connector right underneath the car and

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:31.909 
connector right underneath the car and
you<00:05:29.879> just<00:05:30.089> twist<00:05:30.509> it<00:05:30.839> and<00:05:31.050> it's<00:05:31.469> very<00:05:31.679> easy<00:05:31.740> to

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
you just twist it and it's very easy to

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:33.980 
you just twist it and it's very easy to
get<00:05:32.069> to<00:05:32.129> you<00:05:32.309> take<00:05:32.669> anything<00:05:32.849> off<00:05:33.059> it's<00:05:33.449> super

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
get to you take anything off it's super

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.959 
get to you take anything off it's super
easy<00:05:34.110> this<00:05:34.349> literally<00:05:34.740> took<00:05:35.009> me<00:05:35.189> 30<00:05:35.490> seconds

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:35.969 
easy this literally took me 30 seconds

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:38.179 
easy this literally took me 30 seconds
to<00:05:36.059> do<00:05:36.209> it's<00:05:36.749> so<00:05:37.229> easy<00:05:37.499> to<00:05:37.589> do<00:05:37.769> it<00:05:37.860> you<00:05:37.919> just<00:05:37.949> pop

00:05:38.179 --> 00:05:38.189 
to do it's so easy to do it you just pop

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:40.879 
to do it's so easy to do it you just pop
the<00:05:38.399> new<00:05:38.519> one<00:05:38.550> in<00:05:38.849> and<00:05:39.289> slip<00:05:40.289> it<00:05:40.439> into<00:05:40.559> the<00:05:40.709> hole

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:40.889 
the new one in and slip it into the hole

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:43.040 
the new one in and slip it into the hole
there<00:05:41.129> and<00:05:41.429> twist<00:05:41.819> it<00:05:41.999> and<00:05:42.179> you're<00:05:42.929> in

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.019 
there and twist it and you're in
business<00:05:43.229> and<00:05:43.469> that's<00:05:43.589> it<00:05:43.889> so<00:05:44.309> this<00:05:44.669> is<00:05:44.729> how<00:05:44.879> it

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:45.029 
business and that's it so this is how it

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:47.029 
business and that's it so this is how it
looks<00:05:45.149> in<00:05:45.240> the<00:05:45.300> daytime<00:05:45.689> with<00:05:46.229> the<00:05:46.409> old<00:05:46.679> bulb

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 
looks in the daytime with the old bulb

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:49.850 
looks in the daytime with the old bulb
and<00:05:47.459> that's<00:05:48.300> the<00:05:48.509> new<00:05:48.629> bulb<00:05:48.899> so<00:05:49.259> not<00:05:49.619> a<00:05:49.649> huge

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
and that's the new bulb so not a huge

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.169 
and that's the new bulb so not a huge
difference<00:05:50.039> in<00:05:50.339> the<00:05:50.429> daytime<00:05:50.789> there<00:05:50.969> but<00:05:51.119> it

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:51.179 
difference in the daytime there but it

00:05:51.179 --> 00:05:53.959 
difference in the daytime there but it
is<00:05:51.300> obviously<00:05:51.659> much<00:05:51.959> whiter<00:05:52.319> and<00:05:52.639> then<00:05:53.639> here

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:53.969 
is obviously much whiter and then here

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:57.769
