California<00:02:54.130> was<00:02:54.310> staying<00:02:54.520> on<00:02:54.640> a<00:02:54.670> friend's

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
California was staying on a friend's

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.840 
California was staying on a friend's
backyard<00:02:55.950> so<00:02:56.950> she's<00:02:57.220> just<00:02:57.280> letting<00:02:57.640> us<00:02:57.700> use

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
backyard so she's just letting us use

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.390 
backyard so she's just letting us use
our<00:02:57.940> water<00:02:58.270> hose<00:02:58.570> and<00:02:59.410> we<00:02:59.680> could<00:02:59.830> probably<00:02:59.950> use

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
our water hose and we could probably use

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.100 
our water hose and we could probably use
anything<00:03:00.640> in<00:03:00.850> her<00:03:00.970> house<00:03:01.180> because<00:03:01.540> she's<00:03:01.930> so

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
anything in her house because she's so

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.850 
anything in her house because she's so
awesome<00:03:02.320> like<00:03:02.680> that<00:03:03.930> so<00:03:04.930> we<00:03:05.050> still<00:03:05.500> won't<00:03:05.650> have

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
awesome like that so we still won't have

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.230 
awesome like that so we still won't have
electricity<00:03:06.010> because<00:03:06.640> we<00:03:06.910> didn't<00:03:07.180> have

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
electricity because we didn't have

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.930 
electricity because we didn't have
enough<00:03:07.780> to<00:03:07.900> buy<00:03:07.990> a<00:03:08.020> generator<00:03:08.290> which<00:03:09.250> totally

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
enough to buy a generator which totally

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.660 
enough to buy a generator which totally
stinks<00:03:10.630> I<00:03:10.780> really<00:03:11.470> really<00:03:11.830> wanted<00:03:12.070> to<00:03:12.220> buy<00:03:12.340> a

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
stinks I really really wanted to buy a

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:19.080 
stinks I really really wanted to buy a
generator<00:03:13.950> at<00:03:14.950> least<00:03:15.580> a<00:03:16.800> 4000<00:03:17.800> watt<00:03:18.400> generator

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
generator at least a 4000 watt generator

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.120 
generator at least a 4000 watt generator
but<00:03:19.690> I<00:03:19.930> guess<00:03:19.990> we're<00:03:20.500> just<00:03:20.530> gonna<00:03:20.710> have<00:03:20.830> to

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
but I guess we're just gonna have to

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.990 
but I guess we're just gonna have to
wait<00:03:21.160> till<00:03:22.739> we<00:03:23.739> start<00:03:23.980> working<00:03:24.100> to<00:03:24.310> amazon<00:03:24.790> and

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
wait till we start working to amazon and

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.390 
wait till we start working to amazon and
when<00:03:25.090> I<00:03:25.120> say<00:03:25.360> we<00:03:25.600> I<00:03:25.630> mean<00:03:26.080> we<00:03:26.380> as<00:03:26.980> a<00:03:27.190> my

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
when I say we I mean we as a my

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.300 
when I say we I mean we as a my
husband's<00:03:27.820> going<00:03:27.970> to<00:03:28.060> allow<00:03:28.330> me<00:03:28.720> to

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
husband's going to allow me to

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.170 
husband's going to allow me to
amazon<00:03:30.260> we<00:03:31.260> are<00:03:31.410> going<00:03:31.680> to<00:03:32.010> attempt<00:03:32.580> me

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180

working<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:33.780> night<00:03:33.930> shift<00:03:33.959> and<00:03:34.590> him<00:03:35.160> working

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
working the night shift and him working

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.720 
working the night shift and him working
the<00:03:35.610> day<00:03:35.849> shift<00:03:37.459> we'll<00:03:38.459> see<00:03:38.580> how<00:03:38.610> that<00:03:38.760> goes

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
the day shift we'll see how that goes

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.870 
the day shift we'll see how that goes
basically<00:03:41.730> so<00:03:41.910> we<00:03:42.000> can<00:03:42.180> get<00:03:42.830> a<00:03:43.830> decent<00:03:44.640> amount

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
basically so we can get a decent amount

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.759 
basically so we can get a decent amount
of<00:03:45.150> money<00:03:45.330> so<00:03:45.720> that<00:03:45.750> we<00:03:45.989> don't<00:03:46.170> have<00:03:46.319> to<00:03:46.560> work

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
of money so that we don't have to work

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:53.380 
of money so that we don't have to work
for<00:03:46.800> a<00:03:47.069> while<00:03:47.310> after<00:03:48.000> that<00:03:48.769> we<00:03:49.769> already

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.940 

underestimated<00:03:54.390> the<00:03:54.630> amount<00:03:54.870> of<00:03:55.260> money<00:03:55.380> it

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
underestimated the amount of money it

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.320 
underestimated the amount of money it
would<00:03:56.069> take<00:03:56.099> to<00:03:56.640> get<00:03:56.790> to<00:03:56.849> California<00:03:59.330> we've

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
would take to get to California we've

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.180 
would take to get to California we've
been<00:04:00.780> through<00:04:00.989> a<00:04:01.080> lot<00:04:01.110> of<00:04:01.319> gas<00:04:01.590> money<00:04:01.860> already

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
been through a lot of gas money already

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.030 
been through a lot of gas money already
which<00:04:02.910> really<00:04:03.540> stinks<00:04:03.690> and<00:04:04.230> was<00:04:04.500> totally

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
which really stinks and was totally

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.539 
which really stinks and was totally
unexpected<00:04:06.140> we<00:04:07.140> did<00:04:07.319> like<00:04:07.860> kind<00:04:08.340> of<00:04:08.400> an

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
unexpected we did like kind of an

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.190 
unexpected we did like kind of an
estimator<00:04:09.030> and<00:04:09.420> we<00:04:09.569> thought<00:04:09.750> it<00:04:09.810> would<00:04:10.019> be

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
estimator and we thought it would be

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.160 
estimator and we thought it would be
around<00:04:11.090> three<00:04:12.090> hundred<00:04:12.150> and<00:04:12.540> fifty<00:04:12.810> dollars

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
around three hundred and fifty dollars

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.410 
around three hundred and fifty dollars
to<00:04:13.440> get<00:04:13.560> there<00:04:13.799> and<00:04:14.160> from<00:04:14.940> Illinois<00:04:15.330> to

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
to get there and from Illinois to

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.229 
to get there and from Illinois to
California<00:04:16.579> it's<00:04:17.579> looking<00:04:17.850> like<00:04:18.000> it's<00:04:18.150> gonna

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
California it's looking like it's gonna

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.870 
California it's looking like it's gonna
be<00:04:18.450> way<00:04:18.630> more<00:04:18.660> I<00:04:19.229> don't<00:04:20.130> know<00:04:20.280> that's<00:04:20.729> just

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
be way more I don't know that's just

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.900 
be way more I don't know that's just
because<00:04:21.500> we're<00:04:22.500> pulling<00:04:22.830> a<00:04:22.919> trailer<00:04:23.160> but<00:04:23.729> we

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
because we're pulling a trailer but we

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.890 
because we're pulling a trailer but we
went<00:04:24.380> based<00:04:25.380> off<00:04:25.680> of<00:04:25.940> our<00:04:26.940> old<00:04:27.210> trailer<00:04:27.690> so

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
went based off of our old trailer so

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.190 
went based off of our old trailer so
that<00:04:28.020> we<00:04:28.139> would<00:04:28.290> have

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
that we would have

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:40.170 
that we would have
a<00:04:29.320> lot<00:04:29.950> more<00:04:38.130> I'm<00:04:39.130> not<00:04:39.370> quite<00:04:39.610> sure<00:04:39.640> exactly

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
a lot more I'm not quite sure exactly

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.480 
a lot more I'm not quite sure exactly
what<00:04:40.720> we're<00:04:40.840> gonna<00:04:40.930> do<00:04:41.170> about<00:04:41.530> that<00:04:44.100> is<00:04:45.100> going

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
what we're gonna do about that is going

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.610 
what we're gonna do about that is going
to<00:04:45.670> mess<00:04:45.850> up<00:04:46.000> our<00:04:46.120> budget<00:04:46.510> pretty<00:04:46.750> badly<00:04:47.460> so
