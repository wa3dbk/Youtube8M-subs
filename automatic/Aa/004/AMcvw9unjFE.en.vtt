00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
important that we engage our mind muscle

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.680 
important that we engage our mind muscle
link<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:53.910> we're<00:00:54.030> going<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.210> be<00:00:54.270> thinking<00:00:54.600> about

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
link so we're going to be thinking about

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.600

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.410 
gonna be thinking about them both on the
concentric<00:00:59.100> phase<00:00:59.340> on<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.640> way<00:00:59.730> up<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.180> the

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
concentric phase on the way up and the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.330 
concentric phase on the way up and the
eccentric<00:01:00.809> phase<00:01:01.020> on<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.289> way<00:01:01.739> down<00:01:01.949> very

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
eccentric phase on the way down very

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.770 
eccentric phase on the way down very
very<00:01:02.640> important<00:01:03.120> especially<00:01:03.329> when<00:01:03.660> you're

we've<00:01:06.000> got<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.180> isolate<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.630> muscle<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:07.229> order

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
we've got to isolate the muscle in order

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.820 
we've got to isolate the muscle in order
to<00:01:08.090> maximize<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.299> be<00:01:09.360> efficient<00:01:09.750> with<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:10.020> so

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830

set of dumbbells and you're going to do

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.110 
set of dumbbells and you're going to do
the<00:03:45.770> same<00:03:45.920> thing<00:03:46.160> we<00:03:46.280> just<00:03:46.430> did<00:03:46.580> except

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
the same thing we just did except

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.580 
the same thing we just did except
instead<00:03:47.540> of<00:03:47.630> hammer<00:03:47.930> curls<00:03:48.290> you're<00:03:48.410> going<00:03:48.530> to

it's almost like you feel them grow as
you're<00:03:55.790> working<00:03:56.090> out<00:03:56.240> it's<00:03:57.110> such<00:03:57.290> a<00:03:57.320> it's<00:03:57.680> such

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
you're working out it's such a it's such

you're working out it's such a it's such
an<00:03:58.070> isolation<00:03:58.640> moving<00:03:58.940> then<00:03:59.030> that<00:03:59.210> tense<00:03:59.420> move

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
an isolation moving then that tense move

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.990 
an isolation moving then that tense move
that<00:03:59.870> you<00:04:00.530> know<00:04:00.560> you're<00:04:00.800> just<00:04:01.010> you're<00:04:01.760> really
