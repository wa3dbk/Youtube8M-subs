we have oh not very pleasant we

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:02.180 
we have oh not very pleasant we
hopefully<00:04:56.940> defeated<00:04:58.500> okay<00:04:59.500> that's<00:04:59.890> it

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.590 

hopefully<00:05:03.190> we're<00:05:03.520> done<00:05:03.850> with<00:05:04.030> the<00:05:04.150> blaze<00:05:04.390> of

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
hopefully we're done with the blaze of

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:10.770 
hopefully we're done with the blaze of
hades<00:05:05.550> that<00:05:06.550> is<00:05:06.760> hopefully<00:05:09.450> because<00:05:10.450> that

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
hades that is hopefully because that

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.640 
hades that is hopefully because that
would<00:05:10.990> be<00:05:11.170> very<00:05:11.980> satisfying

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.890 

and<00:05:15.940> I<00:05:16.940> think<00:05:17.540> we're<00:05:17.810> done<00:05:17.990> with<00:05:18.020> it<00:05:19.450> yes<00:05:20.450> that

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
and I think we're done with it yes that

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.070 
and I think we're done with it yes that
was<00:05:21.890> actually<00:05:22.760> relatively<00:05:23.150> painless

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.570 

sometimes<00:05:27.080> it<00:05:27.230> takes<00:05:27.410> me<00:05:27.620> ten<00:05:28.040> minutes<00:05:28.250> to

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
sometimes it takes me ten minutes to

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:35.220 
sometimes it takes me ten minutes to
finish<00:05:28.730> this<00:05:30.070> all<00:05:31.070> right<00:05:33.310> this<00:05:34.310> is<00:05:34.520> where

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:35.230 
finish this all right this is where

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:41.320 
finish this all right this is where
things<00:05:36.640> can<00:05:37.640> get<00:05:37.880> tricky<00:05:39.970> but<00:05:40.970> they<00:05:41.180> get

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
things can get tricky but they get

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:47.690 
things can get tricky but they get
treated<00:05:42.550> all<00:05:43.550> right

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:54.790 

so<00:05:48.360> I<00:05:48.960> will<00:05:49.950> get<00:05:50.220> the<00:05:50.430> whole<00:05:50.460> night<00:05:51.300> session<00:05:52.050> oh

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.770 

so<00:05:55.800> yes<00:05:55.980> we<00:05:56.160> do<00:05:56.310> killing<00:05:56.640> Carly<00:05:57.000> climb<00:05:57.270> back<00:05:57.540> up

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
so yes we do killing Carly climb back up

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.620 
so yes we do killing Carly climb back up

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
it is pointless so anyways as I was

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:08.230 
it is pointless so anyways as I was
saying<00:06:00.810> men<00:06:01.290> going<00:06:01.530> to<00:06:02.570> frickin<00:06:03.570> die<00:06:03.750> why<00:06:04.050> not

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.880

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:12.890 
have no fear I never lost at this point

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.200 
have no fear I never lost at this point
