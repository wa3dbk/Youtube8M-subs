00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
floating on top but that's good enough

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.800 
floating on top but that's good enough
and<00:02:09.629> we'll<00:02:10.170> leave<00:02:10.470> this<00:02:10.800> for<00:02:11.790> 15<00:02:12.180> minutes

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810

it's all been 15 minutes and let's just

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.050 
it's all been 15 minutes and let's just
show<00:02:18.840> you<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:19.290> see<00:02:19.320> it's<00:02:20.010> thick<00:02:20.430> enough<00:02:20.730> so

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
show you you see it's thick enough so

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.990 
show you you see it's thick enough so
the<00:02:21.690> Chia<00:02:21.990> has<00:02:22.530> thickened<00:02:22.950> up<00:02:25.550> so<00:02:26.550> what<00:02:26.880> I'm

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
the Chia has thickened up so what I'm

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.400 
the Chia has thickened up so what I'm
gonna<00:02:27.120> do<00:02:27.450> is<00:02:28.050> just<00:02:28.440> stir<00:02:28.800> this<00:02:29.070> and<00:02:30.110> I<00:02:31.110> will

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
gonna do is just stir this and I will

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.770 
gonna do is just stir this and I will
leave<00:02:31.650> this<00:02:31.950> for<00:02:32.310> another<00:02:32.340> 15<00:02:33.209> minutes

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
leave this for another 15 minutes

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.150 
leave this for another 15 minutes
now<00:02:34.170> another<00:02:34.560> 15<00:02:34.980> minutes<00:02:35.190> later<00:02:36.860> this<00:02:37.860> is

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
now another 15 minutes later this is

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.210 
now another 15 minutes later this is
what<00:02:38.820> it<00:02:39.090> looks<00:02:39.300> like<00:02:39.480> so<00:02:39.780> overall<00:02:40.200> we<00:02:40.650> have<00:02:40.830> 30

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
what it looks like so overall we have 30

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.990 
what it looks like so overall we have 30
minutes<00:02:41.520> of<00:02:41.910> soaking<00:02:43.520> so<00:02:44.520> now<00:02:44.700> it's<00:02:44.850> gone

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
minutes of soaking so now it's gone

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.270 
minutes of soaking so now it's gone
thicker<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:45.780> if<00:02:46.230> I<00:02:46.410> were<00:02:46.709> to<00:02:46.770> leave<00:02:47.100> this

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
thicker and if I were to leave this

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.250 
thicker and if I were to leave this
overnight<00:02:47.900> it<00:02:48.900> would<00:02:49.170> get<00:02:49.380> bigger<00:02:49.680> again<00:02:51.260> but

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
overnight it would get bigger again but

00:02:52.260 --> 00:03:01.910 
overnight it would get bigger again but
after<00:02:52.800> 30<00:02:53.040> minutes<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:56.120> will<00:02:57.120> add<00:02:58.010> banana<00:03:00.890> so<00:03:01.890> a

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
after 30 minutes I will add banana so a

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.370 
after 30 minutes I will add banana so a
small<00:03:02.310> bird<00:03:02.520> is<00:03:02.670> plenty<00:03:03.450> enough<00:03:03.480> or<00:03:04.050> if<00:03:04.260> you

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
small bird is plenty enough or if you

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.729 
small bird is plenty enough or if you
have<00:03:04.500> a<00:03:04.530> large<00:03:04.770> banana<00:03:05.190> then<00:03:05.489> just<00:03:05.700> do<00:03:05.850> half

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
have a large banana then just do half

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:17.060
