I<00:00:06.750> first<00:00:07.529> met<00:00:07.680> my<00:00:07.920> crab<00:00:08.130> in<00:00:08.370> about<00:00:08.610> about<00:00:09.030> four

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
I first met my crab in about about four

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.670 
I first met my crab in about about four
and<00:00:09.330> a<00:00:09.360> half<00:00:09.389> years<00:00:09.660> ago<00:00:09.690> well<00:00:10.290> they<00:00:10.530> actually

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:10.680 
and a half years ago well they actually

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.080 
and a half years ago well they actually
the<00:00:10.889> whole<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.370> whole<00:00:11.400> time<00:00:11.700> itself<00:00:12.000> is

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
the whole the whole time itself is

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.820 
the whole the whole time itself is
attached<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.510> my<00:00:12.629> back<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.170> then<00:00:13.379> there's

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
attached to my back and then there's

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.410 
attached to my back and then there's
four<00:00:14.070> legs<00:00:14.280> there<00:00:14.490> that<00:00:14.670> attach<00:00:14.910> to<00:00:14.940> my<00:00:15.180> lips

four legs there that attach to my lips

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.200 
four legs there that attach to my lips
and<00:00:16.110> so<00:00:16.470> there's<00:00:17.010> literally<00:00:17.760> eight<00:00:18.000> limbs

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
and so there's literally eight limbs

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.570 
and so there's literally eight limbs
total<00:00:18.600> like<00:00:19.500> four<00:00:19.740> than<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.039> eyes<00:00:20.160> well<00:00:20.490> my

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
total like four than the eyes well my

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:34.120 
total like four than the eyes well my
back

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.710 

there<00:00:35.130> was<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> long<00:00:35.610> process<00:00:35.820> in<00:00:36.270> training<00:00:36.629> the

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
there was a long process in training the

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.780 
there was a long process in training the
artist<00:00:37.110> because<00:00:37.559> there<00:00:37.800> were<00:00:37.980> artistic<00:00:38.640> was

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
artist because there were artistic was

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.369 
artist because there were artistic was
making<00:00:39.150> suggestions<00:00:39.570> as<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.930> what<00:00:40.050> they<00:00:40.320> do

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
making suggestions as to what they do

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.590 
making suggestions as to what they do
but<00:00:40.920> they<00:00:41.309> had<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.670> bring<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.940> certain<00:00:42.150> amount

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
but they had to bring a certain amount

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.500 
but they had to bring a certain amount
of<00:00:42.720> of<00:00:43.340> theatrics<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.059> table<00:00:45.360> as

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
of of theatrics to the to the table as

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.570 
of of theatrics to the to the table as
well<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:46.170> then<00:00:46.440> Michael<00:00:46.739> Curry<00:00:46.949> actually<00:00:47.400> did

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:47.580 
well and then Michael Curry actually did

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.610 
well and then Michael Curry actually did
a<00:00:47.610> lot<00:00:47.790> of<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.120> initial<00:00:48.900> research<00:00:49.080> in<00:00:49.440> help

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
a lot of the initial research in help

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.979 
a lot of the initial research in help
the<00:00:50.160> individual<00:00:50.879> pieces<00:00:51.059> moved<00:00:51.480> how<00:00:51.720> Crabbe

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
the individual pieces moved how Crabbe

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.290 
the individual pieces moved how Crabbe
moved<00:00:52.290> out<00:00:52.530> turtle<00:00:52.890> moves<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.970> then<00:00:54.120> try

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
moved out turtle moves so and then try

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.299 
moved out turtle moves so and then try
and<00:00:54.329> help<00:00:54.780> translate<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.769> the<00:00:55.890> artists

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
and help translate that to the artists

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.220 
and help translate that to the artists
and<00:00:56.430> in<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.699> very<00:00:56.879> beginning<00:00:57.030> as<00:00:57.900> far<00:00:57.960> as<00:00:58.170> the

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
and in the very beginning as far as the

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.420 
and in the very beginning as far as the
training<00:00:58.440> where<00:00:58.650> that<00:00:58.769> kind<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.010> threw<00:00:59.220> me<00:00:59.339> in

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
training where that kind of threw me in

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.090 
training where that kind of threw me in
there<00:00:59.610> and<00:00:59.750> we<00:01:00.750> play<00:01:00.930> around<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.530> little

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
there and we play around a little

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.130 
there and we play around a little
research<00:01:02.460> on<00:01:02.909> the<00:01:03.239> internet<00:01:03.539> what<00:01:03.690> crabs<00:01:03.930> how

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
research on the internet what crabs how

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.210 
research on the internet what crabs how
they<00:01:04.259> moved<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.619> whatnot<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:04.890> I<00:01:04.979> couldn't

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
they moved and whatnot and I couldn't

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.460 
they moved and whatnot and I couldn't
get<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.369> inspiration<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.289> it's<00:01:07.289> pretty

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
get this inspiration and it's pretty

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.560 
get this inspiration and it's pretty
much<00:01:07.530> on<00:01:08.039> you<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.490> make<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.759> make<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.030> live<00:01:09.360> and

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
much on you to make it make it live and

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.770 
much on you to make it make it live and
work<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.470> biggest<00:01:10.740> chance<00:01:10.860> for<00:01:11.039> the<00:01:11.100> crab<00:01:11.310> is

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
work the biggest chance for the crab is

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.930 
work the biggest chance for the crab is
taking<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.869> human<00:01:13.170> out<00:01:13.259> of<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.940> keeping

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
taking the human out of it and keeping

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.060 
taking the human out of it and keeping
everyone<00:01:15.240> thinking<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.289> it<00:01:16.410> is<00:01:16.440> a<00:01:16.590> crab<00:01:16.860> I

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
everyone thinking that it is a crab I

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.529 
everyone thinking that it is a crab I
mean<00:01:17.250> we<00:01:17.580> know<00:01:17.700> it's<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.850> compliment<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.390> want

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539 
mean we know it's a compliment you want

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:20.139 
mean we know it's a compliment you want
to<00:01:18.600> make<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.810> as<00:01:18.899> kind<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.170> much<00:01:19.320> as<00:01:19.470> possible

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
to make it as kind of much as possible

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:22.160 
to make it as kind of much as possible
that's<00:01:21.149> probably<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.630> biggest<00:01:21.780> challenge

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
that's probably the biggest challenge

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:44.380 
that's probably the biggest challenge
for<00:01:22.200> me

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.820 

we<00:01:45.390> obviously<00:01:45.540> have<00:01:45.869> four<00:01:46.049> limbs<00:01:46.229> as<00:01:46.470> humans

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
we obviously have four limbs as humans

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.880 
we obviously have four limbs as humans
stuff<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.340> just<00:01:47.490> five<00:01:47.750> and<00:01:48.750> then<00:01:49.500> just<00:01:49.649> making

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
stuff is just five and then just making

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.639 
stuff is just five and then just making
it<00:01:49.950> look<00:01:50.009> like<00:01:50.220> all<00:01:50.580> five<00:01:51.060> are<00:01:51.649> working

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
it look like all five are working

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.080 
it look like all five are working
there's<00:01:53.190> certain<00:01:53.460> times<00:01:53.610> when<00:01:53.759> I'll<00:01:54.000> be

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
there's certain times when I'll be

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.460 
there's certain times when I'll be
watching<00:01:54.390> TV<00:01:54.600> or<00:01:54.720> something<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:55.170> I'll<00:01:55.229> see

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
watching TV or something and I'll see

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.170 
watching TV or something and I'll see
something<00:01:55.680> I'm<00:01:55.920> like<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.490> know<00:01:56.580> if<00:01:56.909> I<00:01:56.970> can<00:01:57.090> do

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
something I'm like you know if I can do

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.060 
something I'm like you know if I can do
that<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.659> know<00:01:58.200> always<00:01:58.380> just<00:01:58.770> get<00:01:58.950> in

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
that and you know always just get in

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.830 
that and you know always just get in
front<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.340> mirror<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.820> playing<00:02:00.750> around

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
front of the mirror and playing around

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.899 
front of the mirror and playing around
with<00:02:00.990> this<00:02:01.170> scene<00:02:01.409> what<00:02:01.619> emotions<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.580> can<00:02:02.729> pull

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
with this scene what emotions I can pull

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.719 
with this scene what emotions I can pull
out<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.630> technique<00:02:04.500> with<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.130> acrobatics<00:02:05.610> is

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
out the technique with the acrobatics is

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.550 
out the technique with the acrobatics is
the<00:02:05.819> same<00:02:06.060> about<00:02:06.659> creating<00:02:07.110> emotion<00:02:07.470> behind

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
the same about creating emotion behind

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.710 
the same about creating emotion behind
it<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:08.100> is<00:02:08.190> different<00:02:08.580> for<00:02:09.030> instance<00:02:09.390> I'm<00:02:09.630> not

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
it it is different for instance I'm not

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.660 
it it is different for instance I'm not
going<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.929> do<00:02:10.019> a<00:02:10.259> crab<00:02:10.590> let<00:02:11.069> with<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.580> know

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
going to do a crab let with you know

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.520 
going to do a crab let with you know
full<00:02:11.970> extension<00:02:12.330> I'm<00:02:12.900> gonna<00:02:13.080> tighten

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
full extension I'm gonna tighten
