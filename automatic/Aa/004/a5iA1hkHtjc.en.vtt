00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.169 

I<00:00:20.599> found<00:00:21.349> it<00:00:21.529> Carducci<00:00:21.890> dual-sport<00:00:22.579> because<00:00:23.060> I

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:23.179 
I found it Carducci dual-sport because I

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:25.150 
I found it Carducci dual-sport because I
thought<00:00:23.419> there<00:00:23.869> was<00:00:23.989> something<00:00:24.230> missing<00:00:24.410> than

what I wanted in the market I wanted to
get<00:00:27.589> back<00:00:27.829> to<00:00:28.009> something<00:00:28.310> a<00:00:28.519> little<00:00:28.759> more

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
get back to something a little more

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.630 
get back to something a little more
elemental<00:00:29.570> a<00:00:29.809> little<00:00:30.140> more<00:00:30.320> off-road<00:00:30.919> focused

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
elemental a little more off-road focused

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.020 
elemental a little more off-road focused
and<00:00:31.880> so<00:00:32.689> I<00:00:33.019> decided<00:00:33.710> to<00:00:33.860> build<00:00:34.070> this<00:00:34.309> bike<00:00:34.550> we

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
and so I decided to build this bike we

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.649 
and so I decided to build this bike we
design<00:00:35.589> conversion<00:00:36.589> components<00:00:37.190> and<00:00:37.730> a<00:00:38.120> full

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:38.659 
design conversion components and a full

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:40.540 
design conversion components and a full
conversion<00:00:39.079> for<00:00:39.589> converting<00:00:40.460> a

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
conversion for converting a

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.329

the biggest hurdle to get over that I

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.270 
the biggest hurdle to get over that I
had<00:00:51.880> was<00:00:52.330> not<00:00:52.720> the<00:00:53.260> tools<00:00:53.530> the<00:00:53.800> tools<00:00:53.980> were

had was not the tools the tools were
there<00:00:54.550> I<00:00:54.580> had<00:00:54.790> AutoCAD<00:00:55.540> I<00:00:55.570> had<00:00:55.930> inventor<00:00:56.440> it

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
there I had AutoCAD I had inventor it

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.940 
there I had AutoCAD I had inventor it
was<00:00:57.430> getting<00:00:58.330> the<00:00:58.690> architecture<00:00:59.380> right<00:00:59.680> I

00:00:59.940 --> 00:00:59.950 
was getting the architecture right I

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.860 
was getting the architecture right I
went<00:01:00.400> forward<00:01:00.670> started<00:01:01.180> Sala<00:01:01.390> modeling

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
went forward started Sala modeling

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.520 
went forward started Sala modeling
