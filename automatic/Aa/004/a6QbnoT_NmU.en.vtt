that<00:01:56.560> it's<00:01:56.770> gonna<00:01:56.920> be<00:01:57.070> okay<00:01:57.340> and<00:01:57.490> safe<00:01:57.700> oh<00:01:57.940> I<00:01:58.030> I

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
that it's gonna be okay and safe oh I I

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.030 
that it's gonna be okay and safe oh I I
know<00:01:58.420> it's<00:01:58.780> built<00:01:59.050> well<00:01:59.229> but<00:01:59.470> it's<00:01:59.650> just<00:01:59.860> I

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.290 
know it's built well but it's just I
guess<00:02:00.310> because<00:02:00.460> it's<00:02:00.520> so<00:02:00.700> strong<00:02:01.119> the

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
guess because it's so strong the

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.760 
guess because it's so strong the
materials<00:02:01.720> they<00:02:01.840> make<00:02:01.990> these<00:02:02.170> days<00:02:02.440> you're
