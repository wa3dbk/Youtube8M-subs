concerned why won't they give people the
choice<00:01:40.720> to<00:01:41.170> know<00:01:41.790> different<00:01:42.790> there's<00:01:43.330> a

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
choice to know different there's a

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.020 
choice to know different there's a
Russian<00:01:43.600> study<00:01:44.020> that<00:01:44.290> I<00:01:44.590> was<00:01:44.770> just<00:01:45.010> done<00:01:45.190> that

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
Russian study that I was just done that

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.300 
Russian study that I was just done that
proved<00:01:46.390> that<00:01:46.660> GMO<00:01:47.380> foods<00:01:47.680> causes<00:01:48.100> third

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
proved that GMO foods causes third

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.180 
proved that GMO foods causes third
generation<00:01:48.940> stability<00:01:49.480> so<00:01:50.020> if<00:01:50.350> you<00:01:51.010> have<00:01:51.160> a

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
generation stability so if you have a

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.040 
generation stability so if you have a
child<00:01:51.490> that<00:01:51.970> child<00:01:52.030> will<00:01:52.450> not<00:01:52.540> be<00:01:52.720> able<00:01:52.810> to

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
child that child will not be able to

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.750 
child that child will not be able to
have<00:01:53.230> a<00:01:53.260> child<00:01:53.530> so<00:01:54.010> they're<00:01:54.220> doing<00:01:54.310> it<00:01:54.580> for

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
have a child so they're doing it for

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.610 
have a child so they're doing it for
population<00:01:55.390> control<00:01:55.420> really<00:01:56.020> is<00:01:56.140> it's<00:01:56.380> a<00:01:56.470> way

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
population control really is it's a way

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.400 
population control really is it's a way
to<00:01:56.910> D<00:01:57.910> sterilize<00:01:58.450> the<00:01:58.630> populations<00:01:59.260> that

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
to D sterilize the populations that

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.720 
to D sterilize the populations that
there's<00:01:59.620> less<00:01:59.740> people<00:02:00.160> on<00:02:00.280> earth<00:02:00.340> because

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:00.730 
there's less people on earth because

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.100 
there's less people on earth because
they<00:02:00.970> feel<00:02:01.180> that's<00:02:01.390> a<00:02:01.450> problem<00:02:01.690> you<00:02:01.990> know<00:02:02.080> I

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
they feel that's a problem you know I

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.410 
they feel that's a problem you know I
mean<00:02:02.320> so<00:02:02.800> that's<00:02:03.010> why<00:02:03.280> so<00:02:03.910> you're<00:02:04.060> saying<00:02:04.330> that

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
mean so that's why so you're saying that

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.290 
mean so that's why so you're saying that
the<00:02:04.630> AAAS<00:02:05.290> which<00:02:05.620> is<00:02:05.800> you<00:02:06.070> know<00:02:06.100> like<00:02:06.910> as<00:02:07.150> I

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
the AAAS which is you know like as I

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.810 
the AAAS which is you know like as I
said<00:02:07.510> let<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:07.930> fight<00:02:08.230> to<00:02:08.440> have<00:02:08.860> climate

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
said let the fight to have climate

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.880 
said let the fight to have climate

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
totally eradicate all GMO crops and then

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.580 
totally eradicate all GMO crops and then
start<00:02:33.700> fresh<00:02:34.000> and<00:02:34.240> find<00:02:34.600> another<00:02:34.660> way<00:02:35.020> because

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
start fresh and find another way because

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.010 
start fresh and find another way because
