00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
go very hyper tension with this thing it

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.090 
go very hyper tension with this thing it
very<00:00:42.510> much<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:42.930> combat<00:00:43.410> weapon<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:43.950> may

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
very much is a combat weapon this may

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.000 
very much is a combat weapon this may
like<00:00:44.280> rats<00:00:44.579> or<00:00:44.850> watchdogs

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
like rats or watchdogs

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.110 
like rats or watchdogs
so<00:00:47.010> let's<00:00:47.190> take<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.340> look<00:00:47.460> at<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:48.000> I've

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
so let's take a look at this I've

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.000 
so let's take a look at this I've
decided<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.570> modify<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.079> with<00:00:49.350> short<00:00:49.710> barrel

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
decided to modify it with short barrel

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.650 
decided to modify it with short barrel
short<00:00:50.309> bars<00:00:50.489> can<00:00:50.670> give<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.910> more<00:00:51.030> damage<00:00:51.390> as<00:00:51.539> I

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
short bars can give you more damage as I

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.029 
short bars can give you more damage as I
always<00:00:51.840> say<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.170> more<00:00:52.199> damage<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.860> more

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
always say the more damage the more

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.520 
always say the more damage the more
better<00:00:53.270> fire<00:00:54.270> breather<00:00:54.570> or<00:00:54.840> damage<00:00:55.289> that

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
better fire breather or damage that

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.439 
better fire breather or damage that
follows<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.949> same<00:00:56.160> rule<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.730> also<00:00:57.180> fire

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
follows the same rule and also fire

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.889 
follows the same rule and also fire
again<00:00:57.840> more<00:00:58.140> damage<00:00:58.530> follows<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.980> same<00:00:59.129> rule

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
again more damage follows the same rule

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.389 
again more damage follows the same rule
the<00:01:00.899> rail<00:01:01.079> extension<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.859> only<00:01:02.039> option

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
the rail extension is the only option

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.740 
the rail extension is the only option
for<00:01:02.430> foregrip<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.180> it's<00:01:03.300> certainly<00:01:03.600> worth

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
for foregrip and it's certainly worth

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.690 
for foregrip and it's certainly worth
taking<00:01:04.199> four<00:01:04.379> plus<00:01:04.530> three<00:01:04.580> disability<00:01:05.580> and

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
taking four plus three disability and

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.219 
taking four plus three disability and
you<00:01:05.790> evidently<00:01:06.510> don't<00:01:06.840> care<00:01:07.049> about

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
you evidently don't care about

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.390 
you evidently don't care about
concealment<00:01:07.890> when<00:01:07.979> you're<00:01:08.100> running<00:01:08.340> this

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
concealment when you're running this

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.730 
concealment when you're running this
weapon<00:01:08.790> for<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.570> grip<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:09.960> actually<00:01:10.140> went<00:01:10.560> the

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
weapon for the grip I actually went the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.020 
weapon for the grip I actually went the
straight<00:01:11.010> grip<00:01:11.280> just<00:01:11.460> give<00:01:11.640> me<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.729> bit<00:01:11.880> edge

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
straight grip just give me a bit edge

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.929 
straight grip just give me a bit edge
concern<00:01:12.570> we're<00:01:12.720> dropping<00:01:12.960> down<00:01:13.939> possibly

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
concern we're dropping down possibly

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.219 
concern we're dropping down possibly
would<00:01:15.030> have<00:01:15.119> been<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.240> better<00:01:15.420> idea<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.960> run<00:01:16.110> the

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
would have been a better idea to run the

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.130 
would have been a better idea to run the
program<00:01:16.920> but<00:01:17.189> hey<00:01:17.340> it's<00:01:17.909> new<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.869> looks

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
program but hey it's new and it looks

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.740 
program but hey it's new and it looks
alright<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.700> actually<00:01:21.119> tried<00:01:21.479> this<00:01:21.630> thing

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
alright so I actually tried this thing

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.179 
alright so I actually tried this thing
without<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.990> sight<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.380> thought<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.920> know<00:01:23.009> might

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
without a sight I thought you know might

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.520 
without a sight I thought you know might
be<00:01:23.220> more<00:01:23.430> manageable<00:01:23.640> know<00:01:24.540> I'm<00:01:24.900> not<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.259> fan<00:01:25.470> of

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
be more manageable know I'm not a fan of

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.190 
be more manageable know I'm not a fan of
the<00:01:25.710> iron<00:01:25.890> sights<00:01:26.479> it<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.659> basically<00:01:28.020> the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
the iron sights it is basically the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.249 
the iron sights it is basically the
scar-h<00:01:28.500> from<00:01:29.369> some<00:01:30.299> Call<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.540> Duty<00:01:30.900> games<00:01:31.079> you

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
scar-h from some Call of Duty games you

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.080 
scar-h from some Call of Duty games you
guys<00:01:31.409> might<00:01:31.680> have<00:01:31.799> played<00:01:32.040> but<00:01:32.280> no<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.909> iron

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
guys might have played but no the iron

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.969 
guys might have played but no the iron
sights<00:01:33.360> are<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.540> lot<00:01:33.720> worse<00:01:33.900> it's<00:01:34.380> much<00:01:34.560> smaller

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
sights are a lot worse it's much smaller

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.560 
sights are a lot worse it's much smaller
kind<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.490> fiddly<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.909> use<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.299> kicks

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
kind of fiddly to use and it kicks

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.450 
kind of fiddly to use and it kicks
really<00:01:36.869> hard<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.320> would<00:01:37.470> advise<00:01:37.799> running<00:01:38.310> a

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
really hard so I would advise running a

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.030 
really hard so I would advise running a
site<00:01:39.210> specifically<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.380> surgeon<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:40.979> I

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
site specifically a to the surgeon so I

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.280 
site specifically a to the surgeon so I
am<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.400> fan<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.030> one<00:01:42.180> finally<00:01:43.049> for<00:01:43.200> the

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
don't like this I'm pretty sure there

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.030 
don't like this I'm pretty sure there
are<00:02:19.950> some<00:02:20.099> issues<00:02:20.430> with<00:02:20.610> this<00:02:20.730> gun<00:02:21.470> alright<00:02:22.470> so

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
are some issues with this gun alright so

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.339 
are some issues with this gun alright so
the<00:02:23.730> secondary<00:02:24.239> I<00:02:24.390> use<00:02:24.599> is<00:02:24.780> actually<00:02:24.930> quite

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
the secondary I use is actually quite

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:26.089 
the secondary I use is actually quite
important

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
important

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.100 
important
using<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.730> compact<00:02:27.180> 5<00:02:27.450> is<00:02:27.690> going<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:27.870> allow<00:02:28.049> me

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
using the compact 5 is going to allow me

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.860 
using the compact 5 is going to allow me
a<00:02:28.290> little<00:02:28.319> extra<00:02:28.680> ammo<00:02:29.480> it's<00:02:30.480> even<00:02:30.750> more

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
a little extra ammo it's even more

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.199 
a little extra ammo it's even more
important<00:02:31.319> when<00:02:31.410> I'm<00:02:31.530> on<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.739> ECM<00:02:32.220> so<00:02:33.060> this

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
important when I'm on the ECM so this

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.729 
important when I'm on the ECM so this
can<00:02:33.360> actually<00:02:33.510> plays<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.840> reasonable<00:02:34.349> part<00:02:34.590> in

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
can actually plays a reasonable part in

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:35.780 
can actually plays a reasonable part in
this<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.069> it<00:02:35.160> tells<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:35.459> something<00:02:35.489> about

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
this and it tells you something about

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.150 
this and it tells you something about
the<00:02:36.180> scar<00:02:36.750> or<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:38.090> Eagle<00:02:39.319> and<00:02:40.319> that<00:02:40.470> is<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:40.950> has

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
the scar or the Eagle and that is it has

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.710 
the scar or the Eagle and that is it has
real<00:02:41.370> ammo<00:02:41.700> issues<00:02:42.090> I<00:02:42.120> mean<00:02:42.329> it<00:02:42.450> picks<00:02:42.599> up

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
real ammo issues I mean it picks up

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.089 
real ammo issues I mean it picks up
before<00:02:43.079> I<00:02:43.110> believe<00:02:43.530> three<00:02:44.250> or<00:02:44.370> four<00:02:44.640> on<00:02:44.970> every

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:46.099 
before I believe three or four on every

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.940 
before I believe three or four on every
sort<00:02:47.099> of<00:02:47.129> dead<00:02:47.459> drop<00:02:47.790> ammo<00:02:48.560> which<00:02:49.560> can<00:02:49.860> be

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
sort of dead drop ammo which can be

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.559 
sort of dead drop ammo which can be
maintained<00:02:50.340> because<00:02:50.430> it's<00:02:50.670> easily<00:02:51.390> a

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
maintained because it's easily a

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.680 
maintained because it's easily a
one-shot<00:02:52.109> kill<00:02:52.140> to<00:02:52.769> the<00:02:52.950> weakest<00:02:53.489> police<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:54.030> to

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
one-shot kill to the weakest police a to

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.539 
one-shot kill to the weakest police a to
to<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.019> next<00:02:55.170> along<00:02:55.620> and<00:02:55.890> probably<00:02:56.280> only<00:02:56.430> a

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
to the next along and probably only a

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.720 
to the next along and probably only a
four<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.209> heads<00:02:57.450> of<00:02:58.280> all<00:02:59.280> right<00:02:59.400> I<00:02:59.430> mean<00:02:59.609> a

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
four to the heads of all right I mean a

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.759 
four to the heads of all right I mean a
three<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.180> would<00:03:00.299> be<00:03:00.359> to<00:03:01.049> the<00:03:01.170> heads<00:03:01.379> of<00:03:01.560> those

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
three it would be to the heads of those

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.970 
three it would be to the heads of those
that<00:03:02.099> can<00:03:02.220> only<00:03:02.340> be<00:03:02.400> shot<00:03:02.700> in<00:03:02.849> the<00:03:02.970> head<00:03:03.889> so<00:03:04.889> if

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
that can only be shot in the head so if

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.440 
that can only be shot in the head so if
you're<00:03:05.130> accurate<00:03:05.519> with<00:03:05.609> this<00:03:05.730> gun<00:03:05.940> in<00:03:06.150> fact

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
you're accurate with this gun in fact

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.089 
you're accurate with this gun in fact
I'm<00:03:06.660> going<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.870> suggest<00:03:07.019> possibly<00:03:07.709> running<00:03:07.950> a

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
I'm going to suggest possibly running a

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.819 
I'm going to suggest possibly running a
single<00:03:08.579> fire<00:03:08.900> I'm<00:03:09.900> not<00:03:10.079> using<00:03:10.290> that<00:03:10.440> fully

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
single fire I'm not using that fully

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.210 
single fire I'm not using that fully
auto<00:03:12.230> certainly<00:03:13.230> could<00:03:13.500> be<00:03:13.650> a<00:03:13.680> good<00:03:13.829> idea<00:03:13.950> I

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
auto certainly could be a good idea I

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.190 
auto certainly could be a good idea I
skip<00:03:14.639> all<00:03:14.940> over<00:03:15.299> the<00:03:15.389> place<00:03:15.599> in<00:03:15.840> this<00:03:15.930> gameplay

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
skip all over the place in this gameplay

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.360 
skip all over the place in this gameplay
I'm<00:03:16.440> also<00:03:16.560> going<00:03:16.739> to<00:03:16.799> show<00:03:16.950> you<00:03:17.010> something

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:31.919 
the grenade but the biggest issue with

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:34.250 
the grenade but the biggest issue with
this<00:03:32.069> gun<00:03:32.340> is<00:03:32.519> first<00:03:32.790> of<00:03:32.910> all<00:03:33.030> it<00:03:33.389> cut<00:03:33.959> a<00:03:33.989> fair

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
this gun is first of all it cut a fair

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.140 
this gun is first of all it cut a fair
amount<00:03:34.410> of<00:03:34.650> recoil<00:03:34.829> you<00:03:35.459> have<00:03:35.760> to<00:03:35.910> kind<00:03:36.120> of

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
amount of recoil you have to kind of

in every single direction and I'd see

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:43.370

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.559 
for more of an issue by the fact that
only<00:03:43.530> has<00:03:43.829> 20<00:03:44.459> rounds<00:03:44.849> and<00:03:44.940> a<00:03:45.030> cliff<00:03:45.299> and<00:03:45.450> it's

with<00:03:49.169> a<00:03:49.200> 20<00:03:49.799> round<00:03:49.829> clip<00:03:50.340> it<00:03:50.519> really<00:03:50.790> needs<00:03:50.940> to

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
with a 20 round clip it really needs to

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.949 
with a 20 round clip it really needs to
reload<00:03:51.389> faster

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
reload faster

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.190 
reload faster
it<00:03:52.769> doesn't<00:03:53.040> reload<00:03:53.310> too<00:03:53.549> slowly<00:03:53.849> but<00:03:54.269> you

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
it doesn't reload too slowly but you

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.819 
it doesn't reload too slowly but you
know<00:03:55.730> what<00:03:56.730> it<00:03:56.849> but<00:03:57.060> it<00:03:57.150> does<00:03:57.450> lose<00:03:57.690> out<00:03:57.989> on<00:03:58.019> is

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
know what it but it does lose out on is

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.800 
know what it but it does lose out on is
certainly<00:03:59.459> your<00:03:59.790> ability<00:04:00.239> to<00:04:00.269> kill<00:04:00.540> a<00:04:00.569> large

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
certainly your ability to kill a large

certainly your ability to kill a large
number<00:04:01.260> of<00:04:01.290> enemies<00:04:01.650> I<00:04:01.859> mean<00:04:02.010> it<00:04:02.160> kills<00:04:02.430> so

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:02.669 
number of enemies I mean it kills so

thing<00:04:20.600> I<00:04:20.720> saved<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.110> hipfire<00:04:21.530> quite<00:04:21.799> well

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
thing I saved the hipfire quite well

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.070 
thing I saved the hipfire quite well
with<00:04:22.250> it<00:04:22.820> seems<00:04:23.060> to<00:04:23.150> shoot<00:04:23.330> quite<00:04:23.510> straight<00:04:23.900> as

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
with it seems to shoot quite straight as

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.630 
with it seems to shoot quite straight as
you<00:04:24.200> seen<00:04:24.440> you<00:04:24.530> think<00:04:24.740> that<00:04:24.890> that<00:04:24.980> paisa<00:04:25.340> just

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
you seen you think that that paisa just

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.050 
you seen you think that that paisa just
before<00:04:27.250> definitely<00:04:28.250> worth<00:04:28.400> bringing<00:04:28.640> a<00:04:28.850> sight

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
before definitely worth bringing a sight

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.050 
before definitely worth bringing a sight
on<00:04:29.240> it<00:04:29.390> it<00:04:29.540> seems<00:04:29.780> to<00:04:29.930> reduce<00:04:30.230> the<00:04:30.380> recoil<00:04:30.560> and

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
on it it seems to reduce the recoil and

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.130 
on it it seems to reduce the recoil and
holographic<00:04:32.060> is<00:04:32.180> my<00:04:32.330> personal<00:04:32.750> favorite

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
holographic is my personal favorite

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.650 
holographic is my personal favorite
because<00:04:33.170> it<00:04:33.530> doesn't<00:04:34.100> drop<00:04:34.910> my<00:04:35.090> concealment

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
because it doesn't drop my concealment

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.170 
because it doesn't drop my concealment
buy<00:04:35.750> too<00:04:35.810> much<00:04:36.550> but<00:04:37.550> yeah<00:04:37.670> you're<00:04:37.880> gonna<00:04:37.970> have

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
buy too much but yeah you're gonna have

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.790 
buy too much but yeah you're gonna have
to<00:04:38.300> play<00:04:38.450> the<00:04:38.630> ammo<00:04:38.930> game<00:04:39.200> going<00:04:39.590> around

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
to play the ammo game going around

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.590 
to play the ammo game going around
picking<00:04:40.130> up<00:04:40.220> those<00:04:40.430> four<00:04:40.790> piece<00:04:41.590> ammo<00:04:42.590> boxes

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
picking up those four piece ammo boxes

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.390 
picking up those four piece ammo boxes
to<00:04:44.600> keep<00:04:44.690> yourself<00:04:45.080> sustained<00:04:45.440> as<00:04:45.830> I<00:04:45.920> say<00:04:46.130> it's

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
to keep yourself sustained as I say it's

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.040 
to keep yourself sustained as I say it's
totally<00:04:46.760> viable<00:04:46.790> if<00:04:47.360> you're<00:04:47.480> very<00:04:47.660> good<00:04:47.870> with

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
totally viable if you're very good with

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.250 
totally viable if you're very good with
it<00:04:48.790> another<00:04:49.790> thing<00:04:49.970> to<00:04:50.120> say<00:04:50.270> is<00:04:50.390> it<00:04:50.540> overall

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
it another thing to say is it overall

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.720 
it another thing to say is it overall
doesn't<00:04:51.710> have<00:04:51.800> a<00:04:51.830> lot<00:04:52.010> of<00:04:52.040> ammo

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:52.730 
doesn't have a lot of ammo

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.570 
doesn't have a lot of ammo

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
guys so you're very accurate with this

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.610 
guys so you're very accurate with this
weapon<00:05:07.700> possibly<00:05:08.690> as<00:05:08.810> I<00:05:08.900> said<00:05:09.110> before<00:05:09.230> run<00:05:09.590> a

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
weapon possibly as I said before run a

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.710 
weapon possibly as I said before run a
single<00:05:09.920> fire<00:05:10.190> I<00:05:10.370> think<00:05:10.400> down<00:05:10.760> I<00:05:11.060> do<00:05:11.120> fail<00:05:11.510> this

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
single fire I think down I do fail this

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.300 
single fire I think down I do fail this
mission<00:05:11.780> I'm<00:05:12.110> not<00:05:12.230> kind<00:05:12.440> of<00:05:12.530> trying<00:05:13.250> to

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
mission I'm not kind of trying to

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.710 
mission I'm not kind of trying to
complete<00:05:13.580> it<00:05:13.730> it's<00:05:13.940> a<00:05:14.000> really<00:05:14.180> good<00:05:14.390> mission

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
complete it it's a really good mission

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.470 
complete it it's a really good mission
by<00:05:14.810> the<00:05:14.840> way<00:05:15.020> is<00:05:15.170> the<00:05:15.290> underpass<00:05:15.970> on<00:05:16.970> the

single fire with an engineer tier setup

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.409 
single fire with an engineer tier setup
it<00:05:27.890> might<00:05:28.130> be<00:05:28.250> the<00:05:28.370> most<00:05:28.520> powerful<00:05:28.700> weapon<00:05:29.270> the

my<00:05:34.880> engineer<00:05:35.450> build<00:05:35.690> I<00:05:36.020> would<00:05:36.770> now<00:05:36.919> advise<00:05:37.250> you

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
my engineer build I would now advise you

swap<00:05:37.730> out<00:05:37.910> the<00:05:39.460> single<00:05:40.460> fire<00:05:40.700> rifle<00:05:41.630> as<00:05:41.780> f3<00:05:42.020> oh

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
swap out the single fire rifle as f3 oh

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.250 
swap out the single fire rifle as f3 oh
eight<00:05:42.910> you<00:05:43.910> swap<00:05:44.120> that<00:05:44.300> out<00:05:44.360> for<00:05:44.510> this<00:05:44.810> single

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
eight you swap that out for this single

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.870 
eight you swap that out for this single
fire<00:05:45.470> because<00:05:46.010> I<00:05:46.100> think<00:05:46.160> this<00:05:46.580> might<00:05:46.850> be

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
fire because I think this might be

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.970 
fire because I think this might be
better<00:05:47.210> and<00:05:47.990> it<00:05:48.110> certainly<00:05:48.620> will<00:05:48.770> have<00:05:48.950> a

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:48.980 
better and it certainly will have a

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.930 
better and it certainly will have a
little<00:05:49.250> more<00:05:49.430> ammo<00:05:49.970> of<00:05:50.270> the<00:05:50.500> original<00:05:51.500> one<00:05:51.940> see

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
little more ammo of the original one see

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.159 
little more ammo of the original one see

I run this thing a single firing you're

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:55.240 
I run this thing a single firing you're
gonna<00:05:54.260> have<00:05:54.440> a<00:05:54.470> good<00:05:54.710> time
