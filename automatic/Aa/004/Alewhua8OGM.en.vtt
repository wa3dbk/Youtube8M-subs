00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.810 
were to talk about a press and my
ability<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.439> centrate<00:01:29.130> my<00:01:29.250> joints<00:01:29.579> or<00:01:29.670> make

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
ability to centrate my joints or make

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.940 
ability to centrate my joints or make
sure<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.090> my<00:01:30.210> joints<00:01:30.540> are<00:01:30.630> stacked<00:01:31.079> so<00:01:31.770> that

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
sure that my joints are stacked so that

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.719 
sure that my joints are stacked so that
I<00:01:32.130> can<00:01:32.430> push<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.700> heavy<00:01:32.939> weight<00:01:33.240> overhead<00:01:33.570> well

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
I can push a heavy weight overhead well

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.249 
I can push a heavy weight overhead well
I'm<00:01:35.729> gonna<00:01:35.970> be<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.150> lot<00:01:36.360> stronger<00:01:36.659> if<00:01:36.960> I'm<00:01:37.110> able

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
I'm gonna be a lot stronger if I'm able

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.230 
I'm gonna be a lot stronger if I'm able
to<00:01:37.439> take<00:01:37.619> my<00:01:37.740> pelvis<00:01:38.189> from<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:38.579> position<00:01:38.790> and

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
to take my pelvis from this position and

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.600 
to take my pelvis from this position and
put<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.720> underneath<00:01:40.020> my<00:01:40.140> rib<00:01:40.560> cage<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.460> I

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
put it underneath my rib cage so that I

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.880 
put it underneath my rib cage so that I
can<00:01:41.909> press<00:01:42.299> weight<00:01:43.110> over<00:01:43.320> my<00:01:43.439> head<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:43.770> way

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
can press weight over my head that way

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.410 
can press weight over my head that way
the<00:01:44.009> weight<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.189> know<00:01:44.399> I'm<00:01:44.820> generating<00:01:45.180> power

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
the weight I know I'm generating power

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.929 
the weight I know I'm generating power
from<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.780> floor<00:01:46.020> where<00:01:46.649> other<00:01:47.159> people<00:01:47.700> or

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
from the floor where other people or

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.789 
from the floor where other people or
people<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.600> aren't<00:01:48.869> as<00:01:49.049> tied<00:01:49.590> together

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
people that aren't as tied together

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.520 
people that aren't as tied together
we'll<00:01:50.549> press<00:01:50.790> almost<00:01:51.149> like<00:01:51.299> in<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.720> motion

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
we'll press almost like in this motion

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.929 
we'll press almost like in this motion
here<00:01:52.770> where<00:01:52.950> their<00:01:53.100> pelvis<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.579> sticking<00:01:53.880> out

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
here where their pelvis is sticking out

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.910 
here where their pelvis is sticking out
well<00:01:54.149> now<00:01:54.299> all<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.750> weight<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.500> I'm<00:01:55.680> trying

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
well now all the weight that I'm trying

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.260 
well now all the weight that I'm trying
to<00:01:56.009> push<00:01:56.189> from<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.549> coming<00:01:56.820> from<00:01:56.909> my<00:01:57.090> lower

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
to push from is coming from my lower

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.170 
to push from is coming from my lower
back<00:01:57.540> okay<00:01:57.960> okay<00:01:58.369> so<00:01:59.369> why<00:01:59.549> am<00:01:59.700> I<00:01:59.759> talking<00:01:59.820> about

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
back okay okay so why am I talking about

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.510 
back okay okay so why am I talking about
a<00:02:00.329> press<00:02:00.630> well<00:02:01.110> let's<00:02:01.530> think<00:02:01.740> about<00:02:01.890> an

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
a press well let's think about an

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.160 
a press well let's think about an
exercise<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.119> perfect<00:02:03.570> example<00:02:03.990> of<00:02:04.049> an

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
exercise a perfect example of an

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.899 
exercise a perfect example of an
exercise<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.560> opposes<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.159> press<00:02:05.399> because<00:02:05.729> we

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
exercise that opposes a press because we

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.789 
exercise that opposes a press because we
know<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.090> everybody<00:02:07.020> does<00:02:07.229> presses<00:02:07.649> right

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
know that everybody does presses right

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.260 
know that everybody does presses right
either<00:02:08.129> overhead<00:02:08.550> or<00:02:08.700> bench<00:02:08.849> presses<00:02:09.179> or

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
either overhead or bench presses or

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.119 
either overhead or bench presses or
whatever<00:02:09.569> but<00:02:10.080> one<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.619> best<00:02:10.770> ways<00:02:10.979> to

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
whatever but one of the best ways to

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.010 
whatever but one of the best ways to
integrate<00:02:11.489> your<00:02:12.150> upper<00:02:12.599> and<00:02:12.690> your<00:02:12.750> lower

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
integrate your upper and your lower

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.080 
integrate your upper and your lower
body<00:02:13.230> in<00:02:13.500> a<00:02:13.560> pulling<00:02:13.920> motion<00:02:13.950> is<00:02:14.430> actually<00:02:14.790> not

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
body in a pulling motion is actually not

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.420 
body in a pulling motion is actually not
Hubbell<00:02:15.420> chin<00:02:15.600> up<00:02:15.720> okay<00:02:15.870> right<00:02:16.350> so<00:02:16.560> if<00:02:17.100> you<00:02:17.250> set

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
Hubbell chin up okay right so if you set

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.120 
Hubbell chin up okay right so if you set
yourself<00:02:17.550> up<00:02:18.110> so<00:02:19.110> now<00:02:19.290> just<00:02:19.740> like<00:02:19.830> I<00:02:19.920> was

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
yourself up so now just like I was

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.250 
yourself up so now just like I was
saying<00:02:20.310> with<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.490> press<00:02:20.700> you've<00:02:20.910> got<00:02:21.060> your

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
saying with the press you've got your

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.390 
saying with the press you've got your
you've<00:02:22.260> got<00:02:22.290> your<00:02:22.560> pelvis<00:02:22.890> underneath<00:02:23.160> the

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
you've got your pelvis underneath the

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.640 
you've got your pelvis underneath the
ribcage<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:24.000> now<00:02:24.090> what<00:02:24.660> I'm<00:02:24.780> teaching<00:02:25.170> fun<00:02:25.500> to

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
ribcage and now what I'm teaching fun to

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.650 
ribcage and now what I'm teaching fun to
do<00:02:25.770> is<00:02:25.920> generate<00:02:26.520> power<00:02:26.880> from<00:02:27.060> his<00:02:27.240> lower<00:02:27.420> body

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
do is generate power from his lower body

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.600 
do is generate power from his lower body
transfer<00:02:28.440> that<00:02:28.560> power<00:02:28.830> through<00:02:29.010> his<00:02:29.160> core<00:02:29.400> and

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
transfer that power through his core and

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.150 
transfer that power through his core and
into<00:02:29.970> his<00:02:30.090> lats<00:02:30.330> so<00:02:30.510> that<00:02:30.660> he<00:02:30.810> can<00:02:31.020> pull<00:02:31.680> up<00:02:31.860> and

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
into his lats so that he can pull up and

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.120 
into his lats so that he can pull up and
so<00:02:33.150> now<00:02:33.300> he's<00:02:33.510> using<00:02:33.720> his<00:02:34.440> lats<00:02:34.800> in

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
so now he's using his lats in

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.100 
so now he's using his lats in
coordination<00:02:35.640> with<00:02:35.760> his<00:02:35.970> abs<00:02:36.210> his<00:02:36.600> glutes<00:02:36.870> and

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
coordination with his abs his glutes and

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.190 
coordination with his abs his glutes and
his<00:02:37.500> quads<00:02:38.240> to<00:02:39.240> be<00:02:39.360> able<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.600> pull<00:02:39.750> himself<00:02:39.870> up

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
his quads to be able to pull himself up

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.540 
his quads to be able to pull himself up
and<00:02:40.290> you'll<00:02:40.410> find<00:02:40.620> that<00:02:40.710> this<00:02:40.830> is<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:41.010> lot<00:02:41.280> more

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
and you'll find that this is a lot more

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.760 
and you'll find that this is a lot more
strenuous<00:02:42.060> on<00:02:42.240> your<00:02:42.540> abdominal<00:02:43.170> muscles<00:02:43.200> in

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
strenuous on your abdominal muscles in

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.610 
strenuous on your abdominal muscles in
addition<00:02:44.490> to<00:02:44.930> pretty<00:02:45.930> much<00:02:46.080> just<00:02:46.290> building

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
addition to pretty much just building

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.930 
addition to pretty much just building
the<00:02:46.680> skill<00:02:46.890> it's<00:02:47.010> really<00:02:47.370> hard<00:02:47.550> to<00:02:47.670> coordinate

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
the skill it's really hard to coordinate

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.640 
the skill it's really hard to coordinate
initially<00:02:48.660> and<00:02:48.840> so<00:02:48.870> you're<00:02:49.140> probably<00:02:49.290> not

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
initially and so you're probably not

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.620 
initially and so you're probably not
gonna<00:02:49.800> be<00:02:49.920> able<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.220> do<00:02:50.400> as<00:02:50.580> much<00:02:51.180> as<00:02:51.210> you<00:02:51.450> would

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
gonna be able to do as much as you would

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.840 
gonna be able to do as much as you would
in<00:02:52.440> a<00:02:52.590> bodybuilding<00:02:53.070> up<00:02:53.340> but<00:02:53.460> it's<00:02:53.580> a<00:02:53.610> lot<00:02:53.730> more

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
in a bodybuilding up but it's a lot more

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.540 
in a bodybuilding up but it's a lot more
taxing<00:02:54.270> it<00:02:54.420> is<00:02:54.600> a<00:02:54.810> lot<00:02:54.990> more<00:02:55.110> taxing<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:55.800> I<00:02:56.160> can

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
taxing it is a lot more taxing and I can

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.500 
taxing it is a lot more taxing and I can
feel<00:02:56.820> totally<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:59.210> combination<00:03:00.210> of<00:03:00.270> all<00:03:00.420> of

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
feel totally the combination of all of

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.020 
feel totally the combination of all of
my<00:03:00.600> muscles<00:03:01.010> yeah<00:03:02.010> fire<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.490> firing<00:03:02.730> at<00:03:02.940> the
