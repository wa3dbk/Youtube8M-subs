00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
think there's gonna be one kind of a

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.480 
think there's gonna be one kind of a
void<00:05:29.570> but<00:05:29.870> it<00:05:29.960> was<00:05:30.080> because<00:05:30.440> it<00:05:30.650> was<00:05:30.680> on<00:05:31.040> one

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
void but it was because it was on one

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.550 
void but it was because it was on one
ingredient<00:05:32.360> that<00:05:32.570> was<00:05:32.720> an<00:05:32.810> avoid<00:05:33.080> because<00:05:33.380> it

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
ingredient that was an avoid because it

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.770 
ingredient that was an avoid because it
was<00:05:33.710> on<00:05:33.920> actually<00:05:34.430> three<00:05:34.820> because<00:05:35.510> it<00:05:35.630> has<00:05:35.750> a

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
was on actually three because it has a

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.470 
was on actually three because it has a
tendency<00:05:36.020> to<00:05:36.440> uh<00:05:36.680> I<00:05:37.250> think<00:05:37.430> irritate<00:05:38.030> scalp

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:38.480

00:07:35.079 --> 00:07:35.089 
it gets a little bit more you know

00:07:35.089 --> 00:07:37.929 
it gets a little bit more you know
frigid<00:07:35.870> and<00:07:36.860> then<00:07:37.009> see<00:07:37.219> how<00:07:37.399> it<00:07:37.580> kind<00:07:37.729> of<00:07:37.819> holds

00:07:37.929 --> 00:07:37.939 
frigid and then see how it kind of holds

00:07:37.939 --> 00:07:39.519 
frigid and then see how it kind of holds
up<00:07:38.149> with<00:07:38.270> the<00:07:38.360> moisture<00:07:38.749> stand<00:07:39.080> the<00:07:39.169> moisture

00:07:39.519 --> 00:07:39.529 
up with the moisture stand the moisture

00:07:39.529 --> 00:07:41.139 
up with the moisture stand the moisture
level<00:07:39.559> still<00:07:39.949> holds<00:07:40.219> up<00:07:40.309> but<00:07:40.699> for<00:07:40.819> right<00:07:40.969> now<00:07:40.999> I

00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:41.149 
level still holds up but for right now I

00:07:41.149 --> 00:07:46.989 
level still holds up but for right now I
think<00:07:41.300> 299<00:07:41.749> it's<00:07:42.259> a<00:07:42.649> go<00:07:43.189> I<00:07:43.699> like<00:07:44.659> it<00:07:44.930> um<00:07:45.229> and<00:07:45.999> if

00:07:46.989 --> 00:07:46.999 
think 299 it's a go I like it um and if
