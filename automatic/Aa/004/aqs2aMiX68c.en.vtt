 another touching his chin and after 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.600

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.720
 I feel the guilt of everything he has quoted 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:12.500
 tell Santa Claus because I am 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:16.610

 but because he says what happens is that 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:27.259
 I was listening through the window 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:30.540
 when the doctor told you that you had to 

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:33.630
 replace santa claus 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:35.970
 well I'm going to tell you I wanted to 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:39.180
 dress up as Santa Claus and distribute the 

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:42.530
 toys you would not have said before now 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:45.390
 what do we do I know I have a great idea 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:48.810
 going to the site, it's going to be holy 

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:53.280
 yes, but for that you have to 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:55.500
 traffic the eye in case you clean one by 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.620
 one the toys that you painted with 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:02.340
 paint all colors take out the 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:05.880
 mustache to the dolls and leave everything as 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:09.030
 was between the two will try to 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:11.910
 distribute all the toys and that each 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:17.450
 one of the children in this neighborhood has the 

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:17.450
 hers what they think they are going to do 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:28.270
 and so the two friends go out to distribute 

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:30.810
 the gifts and fulfill the mission of 

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.810
 closing
