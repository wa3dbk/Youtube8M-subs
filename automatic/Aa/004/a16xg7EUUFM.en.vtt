back<00:05:26.550> to<00:05:26.850> well<00:05:27.840> it's<00:05:28.110> the<00:05:28.230> same<00:05:28.410> formation<00:05:28.680> for

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
back to well it's the same formation for

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.430 
back to well it's the same formation for
231<00:05:29.460> but<00:05:29.850> it's<00:05:29.970> a<00:05:30.090> wide<00:05:30.300> formation<00:05:30.990> am<00:05:31.200> I

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
231 but it's a wide formation am I

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.990 
231 but it's a wide formation am I
didn't<00:05:31.980> know<00:05:32.040> what<00:05:32.190> to<00:05:32.220> do<00:05:32.460> because<00:05:32.700> the

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
didn't know what to do because the

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.480 
didn't know what to do because the
players<00:05:33.240> I've<00:05:33.480> actually<00:05:33.630> got<00:05:33.960> our<00:05:34.200> cated<00:05:35.040> for

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
players I've actually got our cated for

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.990 
players I've actually got our cated for
certain<00:05:36.480> types<00:05:36.660> of<00:05:36.780> formations<00:05:37.110> and<00:05:37.610> it<00:05:38.610> not

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
certain types of formations and it not

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.150 
certain types of formations and it not
always<00:05:39.420> takes<00:05:39.690> me<00:05:39.900> a<00:05:39.930> while<00:05:40.200> for<00:05:40.680> me<00:05:40.800> to<00:05:40.950> try

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
always takes me a while for me to try

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.010 
always takes me a while for me to try
and<00:05:41.190> find<00:05:41.430> the<00:05:41.580> perfect<00:05:41.760> formation<00:05:42.240> oldham

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
and find the perfect formation oldham

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.610 
and find the perfect formation oldham
for<00:05:43.200> example<00:05:43.710> it<00:05:44.370> took<00:05:44.610> me<00:05:44.990> I'll<00:05:45.990> say<00:05:46.440> at<00:05:46.590> least

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
for example it took me I'll say at least

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.190 
for example it took me I'll say at least
a<00:05:46.980> season<00:05:47.640> or<00:05:47.910> two<00:05:47.940> to<00:05:48.540> find<00:05:48.810> the<00:05:48.990> perfect

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:49.200 
a season or two to find the perfect

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.880 
a season or two to find the perfect
formation<00:05:49.740> for<00:05:50.160> them<00:05:50.630> the<00:05:51.630> 4411<00:05:52.260> was<00:05:52.590> absolute

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:52.890 
formation for them the 4411 was absolute

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:55.430 
formation for them the 4411 was absolute
brilliant<00:05:53.400> with<00:05:54.030> our<00:05:54.240> team<00:05:54.480> and<00:05:54.510> that<00:05:54.900> with

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
brilliant with our team and that with

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.800 
brilliant with our team and that with
