for you that you'll write it in that

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:06.520 
for you that you'll write it in that
order

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
order

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.190 
order
okay<00:03:06.950> and<00:03:07.730> it<00:03:08.000> says<00:03:08.180> here's<00:03:08.450> a<00:03:08.540> hint<00:03:08.780> you<00:03:09.019> may

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
okay and it says here's a hint you may

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.770 
okay and it says here's a hint you may
want<00:03:09.530> to<00:03:09.620> develop<00:03:09.890> your<00:03:10.220> cause<00:03:10.640> first<00:03:11.360> and

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
want to develop your cause first and

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.680 
want to develop your cause first and
then<00:03:12.050> the<00:03:12.230> effect<00:03:12.760> finding<00:03:13.760> out<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.060> cause<00:03:14.300> is

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
then the effect finding out the cause is

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.759 
then the effect finding out the cause is
probably<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.500> easiest<00:03:15.709> thing<00:03:16.070> to<00:03:16.250> do<00:03:16.549> first

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
probably the easiest thing to do first

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.770 
probably the easiest thing to do first
remember<00:03:18.769> going<00:03:19.130> back<00:03:19.250> to<00:03:19.459> our<00:03:20.060> earlier<00:03:20.390> slide

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
remember going back to our earlier slide

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.770 
remember going back to our earlier slide
that<00:03:20.810> you<00:03:21.140> saw<00:03:21.610> one<00:03:22.610> cause<00:03:22.910> can<00:03:23.269> have<00:03:23.450> many

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
that you saw one cause can have many

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.130 
that you saw one cause can have many
effects<00:03:24.410> all<00:03:24.799> right<00:03:24.950> so<00:03:25.840> finding<00:03:26.840> all<00:03:26.959> the

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
effects all right so finding all the

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.170 
effects all right so finding all the
effects<00:03:27.590> might<00:03:27.769> be<00:03:27.980> difficult<00:03:28.250> to<00:03:28.700> do<00:03:28.880> so<00:03:28.910> I

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
effects might be difficult to do so I

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.259 
effects might be difficult to do so I
would<00:03:29.600> I<00:03:29.900> would<00:03:30.110> first<00:03:30.519> as<00:03:31.519> I'm<00:03:31.790> writing<00:03:32.000> this

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269

would I would first as I'm writing this
essay<00:03:32.540> I<00:03:32.810> would<00:03:33.110> think<00:03:33.290> of<00:03:33.440> the<00:03:33.530> cause<00:03:33.769> first

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
essay I would think of the cause first

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:36.460 
essay I would think of the cause first
and<00:03:35.090> then<00:03:35.390> come<00:03:35.630> up<00:03:35.660> with<00:03:35.810> the<00:03:35.959> effects

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
and then come up with the effects

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.069 
and then come up with the effects
afterwards<00:03:37.100> we<00:03:37.220> have<00:03:37.400> plenty<00:03:37.610> of<00:03:37.700> practice<00:03:38.079> in

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
afterwards we have plenty of practice in

here<00:05:18.969> the<00:05:19.120> cause<00:05:19.360> and<00:05:19.629> effect<00:05:20.020> and<00:05:20.319> turn<00:05:21.310> it

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
here the cause and effect and turn it

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.540 
here the cause and effect and turn it
into<00:05:21.580> a<00:05:21.759> paper<00:05:22.180> or<00:05:22.629> into<00:05:23.199> an<00:05:23.319> essay<00:05:23.770> and<00:05:24.340> we're

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
into a paper or into an essay and we're

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.420 
into a paper or into an essay and we're
going<00:05:24.699> to<00:05:24.759> work<00:05:24.909> on<00:05:25.120> that<00:05:25.330> this<00:05:26.110> week<00:05:26.469> but<00:05:27.279> if

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
going to work on that this week but if

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.920

you need to go back and watch this again

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.930 
you need to go back and watch this again
perhaps<00:05:29.529> I<00:05:29.740> may<00:05:29.889> have<00:05:30.009> gone<00:05:30.219> over<00:05:30.550> something

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
perhaps I may have gone over something

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.999 
perhaps I may have gone over something
that<00:05:30.969> you<00:05:31.210> didn't<00:05:31.449> understand<00:05:31.900> or<00:05:32.199> perhaps

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.009 
that you didn't understand or perhaps

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:35.249 
that you didn't understand or perhaps
the<00:05:33.729> video<00:05:33.969> is<00:05:34.089> too<00:05:34.270> fast<00:05:34.539> or<00:05:34.870> whatever<00:05:34.990> it
