00:00:03.829 --> 00:00:06.073
Oh my, that looks
great on you, isn't it?

00:00:06.073 --> 00:00:09.050
- Excuse me?
- Quit being modest, that looks good, man!

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.676
- Sorry, what? - Everything,
it fits well, it's a cool color,

00:00:12.676 --> 00:00:16.304
it's very casual, very homely, but
if you want to go to work with it

00:00:16.304 --> 00:00:19.765
- that's alright too, it fits well...
- Oh, thanks.

00:00:19.765 --> 00:00:23.777
- We can give you a big discount on it.
- No, I don't wanna have two identical pieces.

00:00:23.946 --> 00:00:27.711
- No, I'm talking about this shirt.
A discount on this one. - This one is mine.

00:00:27.711 --> 00:00:31.887
That's what I think! It's your shirt!
It fits so good that you should say that!

00:00:31.887 --> 00:00:34.447
That's my shirt! Really
mine! It looks good on you.

00:00:34.447 --> 00:00:38.347
We have to lie for the fat guys,
but on you it looks good, isn't it?

00:00:38.347 --> 00:00:42.468
- It does. - That's what I'm talking.
I didn't say that, somebody else said that.

00:00:43.186 --> 00:00:45.457
- How much did you pay on that
shirt? 15? - About that.

00:00:45.457 --> 00:00:49.410
Here's the deal. I can sell
you the same shirt for 8.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.357
I won't pay for a shirt
that's already mine!

00:00:52.357 --> 00:00:54.427
Of course not, nobbody's
gonna buy used clothes!

00:00:54.427 --> 00:00:57.367
Specially someone who bought
it new and is wearing it!

00:00:57.367 --> 00:01:01.387
And it gets used with time, and it's
not new anymore. Semi-new, at best.

00:01:01.387 --> 00:01:05.067
And semi-new is the new new. And the new new
is the new black. And the new black is semi-new.

00:01:05.067 --> 00:01:08.467
And you'll walk out of the store
wearing the shirt. No bullshit.

00:01:08.467 --> 00:01:14.707
- Credit card? - No, it doesn't make sense,
to buy a shirt that's already mine!

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:17.877
- Of course not! But did you like the shirt?
- Of course, that's why I bought it!

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:19.797
- But where did you buy it?
- Some store...

00:01:19.797 --> 00:01:21.497
- Did they sell you for 15?
- Something like that...

00:01:21.497 --> 00:01:25.387
I'll give you the same
shirt, semi-new, for 10!

00:01:27.017 --> 00:01:29.297
You said 8!

00:01:29.297 --> 00:01:32.248
I see, you wanna bargain,
let's do it.

00:01:32.248 --> 00:01:36.407
This shirt and the pants, for 9 each,
because of this tear down here.

00:01:36.407 --> 00:01:40.417
- I won't pay 9 reais for torn pants!
- But it looks so good...

00:01:40.417 --> 00:01:45.647
To buy used and torn pants to
get a discount on the shirt? No!

00:01:45.647 --> 00:01:49.687
What a pity, that's a
shame, it fits you and...

00:01:49.687 --> 00:01:51.437
No, thanks.

00:01:51.437 --> 00:01:54.037
- Will you take the shirt, then?
- Will I get a discount?

00:01:54.037 --> 00:01:57.937
- I'm already cutting my percentage, sorry...
- So, I'm sorry.

00:01:57.937 --> 00:01:59.808
What a pity, I thought
it looked great...

00:01:59.808 --> 00:02:03.007
- You want anything else, like a belt?
- No, I was just looking around.

00:02:03.007 --> 00:02:06.017
- My name is Wesley, if you
need anything... - Okay.

00:02:07.396 --> 00:02:10.294
- Can I tell you something?
- I should go with Visa?

00:02:10.294 --> 00:02:13.055
No, you're out in the street
in your underwear.

00:02:15.378 --> 00:02:21.025
- Gone to another husband, that's Gretchen!
- It would be the hottest party!
