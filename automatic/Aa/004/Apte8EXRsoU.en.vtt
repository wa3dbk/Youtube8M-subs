00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.980
 hi guys so today I'll show 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.790
 How do you make a tailwind effect on 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.320
 clothes 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.540
 You can see that I've already done it. 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.340
 almost everything I just got in 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.220
 white because I'm going to do along with 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.530
 You, this dress was not me who 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.290
 I invented it already exists I just changed the 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.050
 things to start with 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.820
 is the base color sex then how you want it 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.110
 make a silver paw then my color 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.690
 base and gray 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.890
 so I simply painted the part that 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.890
 I want to say, said 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.460
 because I marked where it would be the 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.520
 shadows so I went again with the 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.250
 gray marker and darkened these areas 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.920
 to stay in the shade is very important 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.990
 do this you can not skip this frog 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.010
 make shadows marked by the hard 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.010
 I fit all 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.840
 so now as the black marker with 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.800
 thin end of it I started to make a 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.550
 dotted in those areas that I marked the 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.560
 shadow 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.170
 then begins to do dots and 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.880
 very fashionable facilities that do not 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.860
 you can see very well that they are points 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.860
 but rather part of a whole 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.810
 then the woman with the corrective toothpick 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.819
 and I was doing these dots in the 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.920
 areas where you will most obviously 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.569
 but I also did not give up some 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.519
 dots in the dark areas too. 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.970
 to contrast with the baby and the 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.970
 brightness 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.030
 if you already have the pen white or 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.320
 correction in pen then the errors that 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.980
 it will be easier than doing with 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:59.560
 stick around with the brush zinho 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.050
 I even went there and I marked the 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.080
 brighter areas glare 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.190
 so you simply make a stain is 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.390
 in this region 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:12.880
 expect to dry now with the gray marker 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:17.830
 I went and gave a little sleep in 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:20.770
 some sparkles and then I decided to make a 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.350
 Aged pink matches in dress 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:26.250
 so I just painted pink and 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.250
 I marked the shadow 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.390
 then just sign it's ready 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.230
