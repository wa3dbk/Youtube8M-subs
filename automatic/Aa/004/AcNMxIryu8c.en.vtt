00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:08.880
 the materials that we are going to need 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.630
 they are leaves and colors 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.630
 pencil 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.820
 slight 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.810
 black markers 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.170
 plastic poly rubber or glue 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.130
 lollipops 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:36.880
 colored markers and everything 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.880
 we want to decorate 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.050
 and in my case I'm going to use a mold with 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.800
 butterfly shape to be able to draw 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.800
 we started 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.440
 let's mark a gift of the butterfly in 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:54.600
 a sheet of color with our zero 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.610
 and we're going to decorate it so we can give 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.300
 the sidrÃ³n the branch the masters all the 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.300
 contour 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.100
 we remember like us more no more 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.539
 with the black marker we're going to do the 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.539
 description in my case we will achieve 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:32.539
 spring 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.460
 and we are going to put our lollipop with a 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.500
 opening that we made annually 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.490
 how do we make catch look at the 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.490
 next butterfly 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.220
 in a procedure we mark the butterfly 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.220
 on the colored sheet 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.660
 let's love 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.660
 the outline we cut 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.900
 that's what we're going to do 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:21.010
 the butterfly in the middle and who wants 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.819
 advance the two for very small successes 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.819
 in this way 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.390
 we open and we have 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.379
 and we went to decorate the colors other 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.379
 blueprints 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.100
 in this case I'm going to do it 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.069
 with black marker 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.069
 we describe happy 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.870
 once we have a magic 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.340
 A) Yes 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:31.200
 what is to give with him 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.200
 you can make other towns
