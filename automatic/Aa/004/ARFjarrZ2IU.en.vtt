00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.590
 at the agritechnica 2013 was the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.890
 youngest scion from the home lindner 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.830
 a small sensation at the diet 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.790
 should be three vehicle concepts in one 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.340
 tugs are united namely tractor 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:32.400
 and hoflader if that was possible 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.920
 We are the first editorial on the market 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.370
 Fields around the linden mountain test 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.380
 the link 90 is primarily for the 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.200
 mountain agriculture and the municipal 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.150
 use designed by the manufacturer 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.460
 The cabin of the tractor behind 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:51.770
 moved forward and set lower 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.120
 the focus is around 85 cm 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:58.010
 characterized feels at handarbeiten 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.780
 also subjectively close to the ground and safe 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.810
 convince the compact alpinist 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.309
 also by his ability 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.700
 Lindner optionally offers a rear axle 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.619
 up to 20 degrees with directs 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.500
 the turning radius is at full 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.710
 steering angle just 7 meters 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.990
 the all-wheel steering can also with 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.030
 follow control from a certain 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.770
 Steering used the front wheels 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.570
 become 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.200
 In addition, the linkedin dogs 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.890
 like to move steering so with parallel 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.009
 aligned wheels 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.109
 that protects the ground and is suitable for 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.749
 everything in manual mode good for 

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:39.479
 countersteer on the slope 

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:41.460
 This is very precise and direct 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.380
 Pushbutton takes the terminal in the 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.899
 the right b-pillar is housed 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.639
 the steering programs become the world 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.619
 or the steering cylinder manually 

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:51.469
 driven and the rear axle 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.689
 regardless of the front axle 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:56.729
 geared towards the motor equipment 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.670
 lindner has been working since the sixties 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.429
 to cooperate with perkins im 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.960
 Diet 90 works a four-cylinder 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:10.740
 four-wheeler come along 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:13.709
 Injection and turbo charging for the 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.930
 emission standard animal 4 interim cleans 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.900
 particle filter the exhaust gases from soot 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.660
 Sharing at nominal speed expresses that 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.470
 unit 102 ps rated power on the 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.040
 crankshaft 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:29.640
 the maximum torque of 420 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.480
 Newtonmeters will be at low 1400 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.239
 reached tours 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.200
 However , this is the heart of the lim Trag 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:40.200
 stepless power branched gearbox 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.120
 the terra matic 09 from zf offers 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.209
 forward two sections to the 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.860
 maximum speed of 43 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.880
 one kilometer backwards 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.530
 Specialist area up to 20 kilometers per hour 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.900
 also an active standstill 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.209
 Government was thought to be ahead of you 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.310
 especially on slopes and slopes safe 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.769
 can approach and slow down 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.080
 Beyond that are also a tempomat 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.510
 and a fourfold gear pump 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.820
 installed as stepless from others 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.459
 The red one is also known to have driven 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:15.090
 climbers three driving modes namely 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:18.180
 manual automatic and ptv so power 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.250
 take off we like the next 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.350
 easy operation even threefold 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.989
 speed deletion for that 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.829
 accelerator pedal you can on 15 25 or 30 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.410
 kilometers are limited 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:34.010
 after which the engine and transmission control 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.420
 sensitive can appeal between the 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.790
 sensitivity levels change with the 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.959
 l grip regulator in the right arm 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.950
 line is integrated 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.600
 there are also joystick allrad push buttons 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.600
 differential lock and finally one 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.329
 direct access to the pc monitor in the 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.000
 Steering wheel console in the shape of a little thread 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:56.940
 The cabin itself is light 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.450
 works well and offers for 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:03.030
 This vehicle class is enough space 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:05.540
 a standard roof window does that 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.280
 work easier with the front loader 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.930
 the flat transmission tunnel is the 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.050
 low building methods of the diet 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.390
 owing 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.730
 and when working with the tractor but 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.320
 not particularly disturbed 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.180
 also in the hydraulic power has the 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.120
 have a lot to offer 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.790
 An axial piston pump delivers up to 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.210
 88 liters per minute to work 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.040
 Raul me that's neat 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.050
 in addition , apart from the separated 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.240
 pumps for steering and work raul 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.610
 I also have a separate oil household 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.230
 available 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:41.230
 By the way, the lintra can be optional 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.120
 either with a frame led or 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.460
 a max guided front force lifter 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.140
 be equipped and also one 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.240
 front loader can be blocked 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:52.270
 where the payload with scarce two 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.700
 very low is a front axle 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.730
 Unfortunately there is currently still suspension 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:00.730
 not the detailed test report for 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:05.490
 lindner lin day 90 read in traction 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:05.490
 issue may june 2014
