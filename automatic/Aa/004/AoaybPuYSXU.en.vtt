00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:09.769
 cedric hello hello today a 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:13.519
 small special recipe special aperitif 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.360
 small appetizers based on surimi and 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.670
 cocktail sausages 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.619
 in fact what we will do we bought 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.090
 a puff pastry in which we go 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.320
 cut small triangles 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.250
 so I equipped myself with this little 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.320
 tool it's super convenient 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:35.570
 and I have to do all this and so we 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:37.010
 will cut our leg into a triangle 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.530
 as if it were in fact he's leaving from 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.520
 cake you agree on the principle roof 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.520
 it's verifiable principle 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.150
 still one so if they are a little 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:00.180
 too big you can re-cut them a 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:01.980
 little like that my faith so here's for the 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.830
 couples do that rosette and we 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.680
 take for example the little sausages 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.760
 cocktail head a little round what is it 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.020
 I have the cup still a little bit 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.100
 I like it when we see a little 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.760
 tired too that's a little more 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.620
 spectacular because you force it 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.590
 look and so we trap it 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:23.340
 our sausage our pasta edge and we 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.890
 roll to make a nice little croissant 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.540
 the famous little croissants which is 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.880
 nice yes it's rare the syndrome see 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.729
 a fortune my experience cédric la 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.910
 thinking of not bad room 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:38.759
 moves to a fortune actually at the beginning 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.950
 it's really on purpose to aja to do 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.210
 two sausages I'm going to go 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.310
 survival are maybe a little longer 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:52.620
 so our weight and their mass loses 1 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:54.390
 surimi by growing more simply 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.159
 it's not pretty in her beautiful gesture 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.690
 thought 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.130
 then continue continue in this case the 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.420
 tension was the last one like that the 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.470
 could see an attacker to pose here 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.869
 butter on rolls we get julie 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.810
 growing we put it there we organize ourselves 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.730
 finish in time you miss the result 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.950
 so here we have made all 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.780
 small croissants for a side a 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.000
 little prettier always a little egg 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.080
 beat so only yellow because 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.980
 if we leave the white it is true that it 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.260
 make an omelette 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.630
 annan understood now that the white 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.220
 and we are in a car but really really 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.220
 a little bit more history of 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.489
 color slightly or small 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.489
 increasing 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:41.370
 rapper you can not see it's good 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.980
 here we go so colorful we find ourselves 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.550
 right away it does not mean so but we 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.050
 will do that in two stages so here 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.940
 all our little stuffed croissants have 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.770
 been brushed with egg yolk 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.510
 I will add even a touch 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.040
 personal a little bit of pepper 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:08.290
 but really very slight story of 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:10.870
 small tits deposits at most it's 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:14.370
 really a little hint and so we're going 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:19.620
 put this in hot oven temperature 180 ° 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.620
 to the banks after we said go true 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.290
 metropolis it rolls in all directions he 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.290
 must get right 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:36.020
 it's gone for 20 minutes of cooking 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:41.090
 so that's twenty minutes later he 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:43.730
 were the show 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.220
 of course then we will not be able to 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.800
 enjoy it right away 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.790
 slightly warm even when we can 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.260
 not demonstrate that 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.660
 means dufour they are really very 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.069
 hot but they are very very beautiful I 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.300
 think you think about it and I find that 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:59.330
 beautiful it makes me want to drink 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.489
 the aperitif it's true we go eh ben we go 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.080
 to go ok it's gone to the ratings or 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:06.550
 test them this recipe and see you soon 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.550
 she has very soon in vain
