00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:06.240
 9 and then it was not clear to the game review bank 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.360
 because I 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.479
 willie gibberish of the new blu ray player is the sight 

00:00:10.479 --> 00:00:11.909
 everyone participates 

00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:14.589
 anyway you have fixed term commitment at all 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:16.299
 unscrupulous stock prices 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:18.839
 and i got you everything but how are you 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:20.999
 also drove why are you here 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:25.339
 it is a can let game rhythm set and you are and let drink 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:26.279
 come 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.169
 so we go look 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:30.899
 the track 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:34.230
 but we look at the village 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.410
 an alert must offer 2 leader village leython also never on 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.410
 known from the eponymous to see 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.550
 The story in the game consists of the classic bidding map duels always got 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.200
 better opponents 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.720
 of course you play with my mouth, but also regularly with someone else 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.870
 character 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.730
 every character of course has its own news it is per second 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.260
 actually as with most fighting games x 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.730
 Thousands of fights continue with the story tells a pilot is running in the folder 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.200
 the village view the injured a purchased things in a bag house 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.240
 charging which music you will play 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.069
 and let the money skills of the characters improve my father 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.060
 some artists who have elements but the basis remains the fighting 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.370
 Of course, the most important thing about games like this is the stock markets 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.300
 Here you can fight each other with two of the thirty characters known for 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.180
 the series 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.300
 You have a choice of many different arenas in all those years as there is 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.000
 a lot of interaction with the environment and with friendly characters to come and help 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 by, for example, a weapons license 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.020
 what our reviewer think of the game 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.910
 what a nice find 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.320
 zaandam castricum n203 from midfield 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.740
 when the watersports course 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:58.920
 purple 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.630
 an unspoilt nature 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.630
 lennik nhm kind of underestimated 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:34.409
 in that case it is 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:36.219
 the fighting game 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:39.459
 but you must not only fight with all different combinations 

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:43.179
 what is the best design to count 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.159
 yes i can realize waalwijk 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:50.979
 a recent example 

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:52.719
 also a good number 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:55.719
 there is a low place in that alongside the crop and a madhouse 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.869
 So hence the debts put people inside 

00:02:58.869 --> 00:03:03.639
 inside it convulsively i like it is well i after the games 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:06.889
 being a good person is not a must 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:10.059
 what can you do October 7 a club that cultures we can not start 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.479
 that is also true 

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:20.119
 was involved and I think the game is a bit realistic 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.379
 it was just something that I could do as well but my hangover 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:31.129
 9 because sometimes a handsome recovered or doctor and games that distance arise 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:35.879
 it has just risen so that 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.989
 why not 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.569
 and yes it's up to my defense 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.569
 the works are made to hand 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.879
 the state plans at least the same to that 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.649
 the market it is once what can i say 

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:56.739
 honda wants me to be a column seem to be more hopeful of sterilizing 

00:03:58.499 --> 00:04:00.479
 estate carey 

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:03.609
 humo magazine for that very much waved lazy quarter 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:07.120
 so I'd rather say that this could not be something new and again 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.120
 would suggest cartoon on Monday 

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:13.189
 Jaap Kwakman 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:15.819
 yes yes yes and not something new but nice 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:17.340
 yes it is nice 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.100
 and you also played the current one against each other on busy days in the schedule 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.550
 of the united states 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.009
 stolen by telephone was a requirement for wessanen 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:30.569
 3 a 60 of most people already in 1996 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:33.020
 also very good 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.020
 we also played that with both teams 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.499
 to compare these with each other 

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:42.059
 or is it the lake 

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:45.059
 how good how good must be to be able to play everyone 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:49.529
 you can like it like it still first gets cologne anp a starting 

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:53.579
 spele.nl but no longer in low swallow German occupier combinations 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.870
 also very important how long I am sick with the fairy tale 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:03.169
 yes yes the longer and the longer and think you are sick with the game yes 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:07.400
 that's what CEO said 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.800
 2 and 10 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.800
 the cs for longer 

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:21.300
 also a good plan why imagine that this game you want to sleep on the day and 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.300
 number sent to make it so nice place 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:28.039
 I have to say 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:32.039
 NEC to consider Jamal Saeed South Korean minister 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:32.939
 Yes, that's possible 

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:36.899
 with that comes the number of falls, Balkenende, she said so well, so he is 

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:40.089
 well you know you would buy but often play three 

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:45.449
 Slowly but surely better bed went sometimes so well it will do otherwise 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:47.089
 to show up 

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:47.990
 well too 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:52.139
 we gave such a game mussel traces so check the site and then you can 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:55.309
 the game also has to be canceled 

00:05:55.309 --> 00:05:58.169
 Gavere South and if you don't like me I have the game 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:01.210
 so don't go to the case 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.900
 but guys that movie wasn't too much by the ever seen 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.119
 that tells humanity for a moment 

00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:08.830
 make a movie
