00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:02.220
 Trade should come 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.220
 Consumption depends 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.310
 today a good two years small package 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:14.659
 yes from very small they have it 

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:17.769
 and Transformer to summon people around 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:21.509
 Catarina Katzer in one are 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:25.799
 Do not poke that it's senseless of its own man at the price 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:28.410
 there will 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.050
 three transformers 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.290
 we have Megatron 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.200
 that's him 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.270
 are that wanted 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.250
 until the first movie 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.380
 then we have forms like that 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.070
 that is although Dr 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.120
 that's from the second movie for Josef Kohnen 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.880
 SV Brake 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.120
 also soon 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.620
 from Fohnsdorf 4 percent 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.620
 To challenge people and he is Wilkes 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.150
 So the 2 wanted a change 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.240
 there is currently 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.040
 So the goals Merlin Lights 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.380
 as this giant package 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.070
 Fürth 29 Euro 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.690
 so 30 euros 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.690
 Statesman 50 so 60 euros 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.000
 that's it 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.250
 This would save if Mainz thinks about the figures 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.250
 now probably not single furniture Compper under ten euros 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.130
 no matter 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.719
 even more thrones here you will not get him new leads under ten 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:38.490
 so 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.450
 It could be said 30th July credit in euros is still a bargain 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.310
 The polo shirt has paid me a - a case 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.150
 I do not want to have any reason for these guys 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.870
 one that did not really intend 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.310
 to bring her more individually 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.770
 Blood percent Zamek already 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.680
 ZhongDe VDMA yet 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.740
 I thought he was familiar with Fruits 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.259
 @ 3 transformation states 

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:16.140
 while claiming and more of Meier is not exactly my favorite 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.869
 Transfiguration artist have me being 

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:21.889
 I also think Movi 1 Megatron 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:24.889
 and maybe later on we can "Ruby" two megatrucks 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:30.439
 Coach Marcello Lippi 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:33.439
 Akif sen 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:37.569
 there you can see his home going 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.209
 Voyager 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.969
 to promote 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:44.809
 when did more dream 

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:46.909
 Wolter, too 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:49.909
 it has this ice layer 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.270
 Streubel 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.049
 with the 3 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.199
 factual team again this Katharina net but that even without me times 

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.930
 so change 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.139
 this paper 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.169
 Package heats know at 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:04.210
 Clemens Prokop 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.229
 Eckhardt 

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:08.139
 the logic 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:11.859
 for the completely cool enemy diesel whole program package there is also such 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.149
 two breaks 

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:15.830
 with those of certain 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.389
 why for example 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:21.049
 Rector to do if you like 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.559
 So blackout the weekend around 

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:26.419
 Westerland is not sitting this year 

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:27.939
 hands you off 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:31.169
 I did not care 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:34.169
 you draw second 

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:38.819
 how much synonymous so some movies percent in the sky but so phone 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.249
 Movies Aachen 

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:44.889
 Especially to the team to me not so to say right now 

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:50.559
 I would have lured the price to a little bit 

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:55.289
 Isaacs just for 30 euros or a piece is Ke you can not go wrong 

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:56.219
 do 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:59.019
 we will also see live here again 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.019
 each 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.119
 the police are tapping 

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:08.119
 the Beth space cruiser 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.779
 I was curious how the transformation of the two is 

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:16.609
 a mood like I have not heard until now, "says Malloth Zwiespalt 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.059
 soon Huszti late the experience of a beer 

00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:23.569
 she pulled ITU formation then they look forward to it if they look good too 

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:26.789
 Also sometimes I feel like you are not flying through the year and everything 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:29.240
 he can do that too 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.180
 I think or where like Manchester it is sometimes even more extreme 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.879
 Freckenhorst 

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:38.030
 Percent retract this whole BlackRock transformation 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.930
 a transformation 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.560
 I want to have fun 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.009
 Of course I'm a lot of pressure because looks 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:49.319
 that is difficult maybe 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:52.319
 maybe to transform but can still wait 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:01.050
 what do you know that way 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.009
 Pack those to these guys 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:05.979
 how we come to lay 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.460
 Let's see that maybe Vilks are quick to transform 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.460
 Strandbad doubt 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:16.550
 our first 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:17.240
 Schües until then
