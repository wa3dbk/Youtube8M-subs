working out with Coach lon it was well
it<00:01:05.460> was<00:01:05.549> something<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.820> had<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.970> adjust<00:01:06.180> to

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
it was something I had to adjust to

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:15.820 
it was something I had to adjust to
change<00:01:07.890> it's<00:01:08.820> been

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.260 

by<00:01:16.830> pack<00:01:17.070> for<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.400> most<00:01:17.640> part<00:01:17.880> when<00:01:17.970> they<00:01:18.060> get

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
by pack for the most part when they get

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.330 
by pack for the most part when they get
here<00:01:18.420> from<00:01:19.350> from<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.830> strength<00:01:20.160> and

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
here from from a strength and

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.890 
here from from a strength and
conditioning<00:01:20.730> standpoint<00:01:21.240> they're<00:01:21.690> raw

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
conditioning standpoint they're raw

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.500 
conditioning standpoint they're raw
there<00:01:22.500> they're<00:01:23.130> kind<00:01:23.370> of<00:01:23.430> finding<00:01:24.150> their<00:01:24.330> way

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
there they're kind of finding their way

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.290 
there they're kind of finding their way
I<00:01:24.780> think<00:01:25.050> that's<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.500> number<00:01:25.680> one<00:01:25.980> reason<00:01:26.220> why

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
I think that's the number one reason why

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.580 
I think that's the number one reason why
you<00:01:27.300> know<00:01:27.420> why<00:01:27.990> I'm<00:01:28.170> here

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
you know why I'm here

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.830 
you know why I'm here
why<00:01:28.770> we<00:01:29.190> have<00:01:29.430> strength<00:01:30.300> and<00:01:30.420> conditioning

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
why we have strength and conditioning

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:39.410 
why we have strength and conditioning
coaches<00:01:31.050> in<00:01:31.260> the<00:01:31.320> first<00:01:31.500> place<00:01:38.030> so<00:01:39.030> everything

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
coaches in the first place so everything

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.900 
coaches in the first place so everything
that<00:01:39.450> we<00:01:39.690> do<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.230> is<00:01:40.830> with<00:01:41.160> that<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:41.520> mind<00:01:41.730> that

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
that we do is is with that in mind that

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.710 
that we do is is with that in mind that
we're<00:01:42.030> gonna<00:01:42.120> try<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:43.340> create<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.420> the

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
we're gonna try to create the the the

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.380 
we're gonna try to create the the the
strongest<00:01:46.200> athlete<00:01:47.010> that<00:01:47.160> we<00:01:47.310> can<00:01:47.580> so<00:01:48.360> that

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
strongest athlete that we can so that

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.790 
strongest athlete that we can so that
when<00:01:48.780> they<00:01:48.900> go<00:01:49.020> on<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.230> court<00:01:49.500> there's<00:01:49.740> a

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
when they go on the court there's a

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.400 
when they go on the court there's a
reduced<00:01:50.100> chance<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.520> injury<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.510> it's<00:01:52.110> not<00:01:52.260> all

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
reduced chance of injury so it's not all

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.650 
reduced chance of injury so it's not all
about<00:01:52.500> just<00:01:52.770> getting<00:01:53.160> bigger<00:01:53.370> for<00:01:54.120> changing

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
about just getting bigger for changing

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.930 
about just getting bigger for changing
bodies<00:01:55.050> it's<00:01:55.320> it's<00:01:55.620> training<00:01:56.070> hard<00:01:56.280> trying<00:01:56.910> to

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
bodies it's it's training hard trying to

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.690 
bodies it's it's training hard trying to
get<00:01:57.060> as<00:01:57.180> strong<00:01:57.210> as<00:01:57.660> possible<00:01:58.340> usually<00:01:59.340> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
get as strong as possible usually the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.340 
get as strong as possible usually the
the<00:02:00.120> outcome<00:02:00.300> of<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.720> is<00:02:00.960> yeah<00:02:01.110> you're<00:02:01.260> gonna

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350
