00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
we were still kerb occur but now we're

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.320 
we were still kerb occur but now we're
going<00:01:35.440> mock<00:01:35.680> speaker<00:01:36.130> we<00:01:36.280> curve<00:01:36.460> and<00:01:36.670> we<00:01:37.150> go

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
going mock speaker we curve and we go

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.450 
going mock speaker we curve and we go
into<00:01:37.540> the<00:01:37.750> first<00:01:37.990> real<00:01:38.290> cobblestone<00:01:38.920> section

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
into the first real cobblestone section

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.910 
into the first real cobblestone section
and<00:01:39.670> next<00:01:40.390> thing<00:01:40.510> you<00:01:40.600> know<00:01:40.750> you<00:01:40.810> you<00:01:41.650> never

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
and next thing you know you you never

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.250 
and next thing you know you you never
realized<00:01:42.490> that<00:01:42.610> it<00:01:42.790> switched<00:01:43.120> from<00:01:43.360> off<00:01:43.930> to

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
realized that it switched from off to

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.870 
realized that it switched from off to
back<00:01:44.440> on<00:01:44.680> on<00:01:44.979> the<00:01:45.070> speed<00:01:45.310> and<00:01:45.580> you're<00:01:45.670> at<00:01:45.760> the

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
back on on the speed and you're at the

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.940 
back on on the speed and you're at the
back<00:01:46.060> and<00:01:46.300> so<00:01:46.450> the<00:01:46.560> cobblestone<00:01:47.560> stacks<00:01:47.800> are

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
back and so the cobblestone stacks are

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.550 
back and so the cobblestone stacks are
so<00:01:48.130> narrow<00:01:48.400> you<00:01:48.700> just<00:01:49.150> have<00:01:49.270> to<00:01:49.360> clip<00:01:49.570> out<00:01:49.750> wait

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
so narrow you just have to clip out wait

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.469 
so narrow you just have to clip out wait
30<00:01:50.860> seconds<00:01:51.340> and<00:01:51.460> then<00:01:51.580> come<00:01:51.820> back<00:01:51.850> in<00:01:52.210> and<00:01:52.390> you

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
30 seconds and then come back in and you

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.420 
30 seconds and then come back in and you
could<00:01:52.600> go<00:01:52.780> because<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:53.229> bottleneck<00:01:54.100> was<00:01:54.220> so

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
could go because the bottleneck was so

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.880 
could go because the bottleneck was so
so<00:01:55.060> big<00:01:55.510> there's<00:01:55.870> roads<00:01:56.140> so<00:01:56.290> small<00:01:56.560> guns<00:01:56.799> were

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
so big there's roads so small guns were

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.380 
so big there's roads so small guns were
coming<00:01:57.130> from<00:01:57.220> such<00:01:57.400> a<00:01:57.430> big<00:01:57.670> row<00:01:57.820> that<00:01:58.000> you

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
coming from such a big row that you

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.539 
coming from such a big row that you
literally<00:01:58.659> said<00:01:58.930> to<00:01:58.960> clip<00:01:59.229> out<00:01:59.350> for<00:01:59.710> 20<00:02:00.340> 30

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
literally said to clip out for 20 30

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.380 
literally said to clip out for 20 30
seconds<00:02:01.000> and<00:02:01.210> then<00:02:01.330> wait<00:02:01.570> and<00:02:01.780> then<00:02:01.870> clip<00:02:02.080> in

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
seconds and then wait and then clip in

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.870 
seconds and then wait and then clip in
and<00:02:02.810> so<00:02:03.350> we<00:02:03.800> started<00:02:04.159> learning<00:02:04.280> really<00:02:04.670> quick

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
and so we started learning really quick

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.030 
and so we started learning really quick
when<00:02:05.060> you're<00:02:05.150> young<00:02:05.390> that<00:02:05.440> okay<00:02:06.440> it's<00:02:06.680> it's

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
when you're young that okay it's it's

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.190 
when you're young that okay it's it's

you always have to pay attention there's

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.260 
you always have to pay attention there's
never<00:02:09.380> time<00:02:09.709> when<00:02:09.890> you<00:02:09.979> can<00:02:10.160> let<00:02:10.340> up<00:02:10.459> unless<00:02:10.910> of
