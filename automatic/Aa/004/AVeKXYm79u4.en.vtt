00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.660
 we pal 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.459
 that besides carrying electricity when 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.400
 ordered motion of charged particles 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:20.180
 substances transfer exists 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.220
 electricity without substance transfer 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.169
 it is possible due to the fact that 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.259
 atomic protons and electrons 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:30.720
 be and and electric charges 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:33.000
 cyclically interrupted and at the atom 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.250
 having the same number of protons 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.290
 and electrons 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.680
 possible dominance in time of charge 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.809
 of one or another sign such states 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.809
 atoms we call you charge the world with 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.089
 balances they can be transmitted with 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.809
 chieftain and there it is tok 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:54.570
 electricity without substance transfer 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:57.359
 you can see it in pure form 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.210
 try there where the motions are charged 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:02.280
 particles are practically absent i.e. 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.309
 dielectric without its electric 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.470
 breakdown we will demonstrate the transfer 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.080
 electrical impulses along the line of 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.600
 distilled water which was 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.280
 fill plastic medical hose 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.280
 fluid drip systems 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.430
 line quality checked through 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.530
 mega resistance measurement 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.200
 we see the resistance is not infinite 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.119
 sheer bare means no 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.500
 bubble 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.500
 breaking with the density of the water channel 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:39.950
 in the first experience at the entrance of the water line 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.500
 kilo volt sparkles were produced 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.000
 discharges the air gap between 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.890
 the tip of the spark gap and the surface of the water 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.090
 water line was used in 1 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:56.200
 wired version without connections to 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.479
 ground electrode entrance with laurels 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.350
 oscilloscope second channel used 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.390
 to control interference through radiation 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.789
 the signal electrode of this input was 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.330
 stuck right days chock the same length as 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:16.920
 and the rest of the metal needle at the end 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:23.580
 water line and so oscilloscope 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:26.220
 the water line here and start homemade 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.940
 high voltage generator which 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:35.750
 breaks the air gap from the floor 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.750
 centimeter do it something like this 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.670
 the same will be at the input lines 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:59.220
 and so turn on the generator generator 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:03:09.569
 included bring the tip of the spark gap to 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:11.599
 water surfaces and see six volt 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.280
 impulses 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:17.700
 Now we do proverochku tear 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:23.970
 contact again bring the spark gap 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:25.739
 water surfaces are not wilderness transmitted 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.849
 that is, it was not a guide through 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:32.599
 radiation restore contact well yet 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.599
 we make sure 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:45.110
 impulses are specifically transmitted to underline 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.540
 that only air was breaking through 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:51.409
 the gap before the start of the line itself 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.590
 the line did not break through immediately after the experiment 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:55.269
 a control measurement was made 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:59.920
 resistance line 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.920
 the megohm meter showed the same value 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:06.739
 in the second experience at the entrance to a single line 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.110
 low voltage changes were made 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.209
 potential 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.970
 pulse generator output up to 5 volts 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:16.489
 was connected through so and set 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.370
 resistors of the primary winding 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:22.510
 transformer ratio 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:25.699
 transformations one strength four tenths and 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:29.240
 secondary end one was 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:33.530
 connected to the ground bus and second to 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:37.789
 it was used at the water line inlet 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:41.000
 again in the wired version of the second 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:46.400
 oscilloscope channel was used for 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:49.030
 control source pulses and so 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.030
 generator 

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:53.539
 assembly and driving resistors 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:02.340
 homemade transformer on ferrite 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:07.830
 cores which during measurement 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:16.370
 will be closed by the screens entering it on 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:16.370
 water line inlet is the longest line 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:23.850
 which goes to the oscilloscope 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:27.270
 so 500 hertz rectangular impulses with 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:33.270
 amplitude of 5 volts and the logs itself works 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:36.540
 single launch mode we see 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:40.770
 the increment of the potential at the end of the line with 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:43.760
 approximately 15 millivolts we will change 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:49.850
 pulse shape from rectangular to 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:49.850
 triangle and see what happens 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:02.880
 as we see triangular impulses too 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:05.660
 well transferred restore 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.660
 rectangular shape 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.640
 and see again 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:27.400
 check 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:31.390
 disconnecting from the vanishing nothing left 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:33.960
 No, that is, it is not a guide through 

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.960
 radiation 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:46.979
 now check from the other end of the lines 

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:46.979
 turn off the transformer output 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:00.819
 impulses almost drowned in the noises then 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.190
 there is a line running 

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:07.169
 to content but to a much greater degree 

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:07.169
 just as transmitting because 

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:25.599
 all honest 

00:07:23.449 --> 00:07:25.599
 Where 

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:32.919
 thus increment of electric 

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:35.110
 potential at the beginning of the line cause 

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:38.050
 corresponding increment of capacity on 

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:40.720
 its late it is difficult to explain within 

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:42.250
 traditional views by shifts 

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:45.940
 small amount of ions 

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:48.600
 h and h in distilled water uncomplicated 

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:51.039
 the calculations give that the mobility of these ions 

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:52.600
 completely inadequate to 

00:07:51.039 --> 00:07:56.410
 explained demonstrated 

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:59.259
 results we explain allowing them 

00:07:56.410 --> 00:08:01.949
 charge imbalance of movement which 

00:07:59.259 --> 00:08:06.190
 occur without particle movement 

00:08:01.949 --> 00:08:08.530
 water is amazing liquid she agrees 

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:11.410
 Our model is teeming with charge you world with 

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:13.710
 balances see details on our
