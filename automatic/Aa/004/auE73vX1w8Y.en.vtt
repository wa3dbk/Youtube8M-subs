00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hi this is bibi on far cry fourth 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.220
 of the name for success a reign of 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.140
 terror you have to kill 30 and a half at 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.550
 mortar mortar you find that in 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.690
 a fortress me I advise you to 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.740
 do that on a fortress that you 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.360
 have already conquered 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.429
 because we'll have to stuff like a 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.199
 big jerk I do not recommend the 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.789
 do in your real part between 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.130
 quotation marks for not you piss 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.140
 immersion there in master mode 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.760
 post German I advise to go there 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.800
 quiet where up to the mortar in a 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.539
 first time stealthily with 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.160
 your best friend the bow 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.080
 I also advise you to swing 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.969
 small stones to denote 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.440
 to remove enemies as much as possible 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.149
 the wall to be able to fart 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.700
 a maximum possible with the mortar 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.930
 also to use the sÃ©verins which 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.170
 allow you to see even enemies 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.430
 through the walls very convenient 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.219
 then a last piece of advice was 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.379
 focus on alarms like that 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.910
 you will be pena to make your 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.010
 release of outposts you do not have 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.039
 no helicopter reinforcement that will 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.809
 ask a lot of problems but in this 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.399
 case there do not panic the frags at 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.870
 mortar will still be counted 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.440
 even if you die so 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.269
 premature and that's it 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.560
 I was able to give you too much advice 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.000
 you leave the path to the 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.680
 release the front post and I you 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.920
 wish a good game have fun well at 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.920
 ciao 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.430
 okay 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.250
 and
