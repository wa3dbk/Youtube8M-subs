00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
 hey people welcome in my channel 

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:10.019
 it's me but many people put me in 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.830
 Recently written mails sms 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.389
 whatsapp and that at the lake year 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.430
 I realized that I was such a special 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.250
 have designed for guitar tuning 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.920
 So there are a few different ones 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.640
 Types and methods of how to use your guitar 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.500
 tune or vote respectively 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.510
 Of course there are the normal ones 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.189
 standard tuning that you know quite so 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.860
 live normally and of course there are 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.250
 special tunings you can do 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.530
 where then the handle then synonymous 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.840
 are very different for the different 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:47.610
 chords and yes, at least I have that 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.110
 the donny tuning that has changed now 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.840
 meanwhile established and have that 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.300
 some bands are already using it 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.829
 regularly and yes as I said I have 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.000
 get a lot of feedback and you know me 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.140
 I'm always behind it, I would be too 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.770
 the comments here too please 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.760
 I like and that's why I wanted 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.840
 now just make a video 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.840
 explain that to you 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.150
 first I want to but before 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.400
 thoughts for the great feedback in what 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.600
 got the time because that gives me 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.710
 simply to continue the force 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.460
 that gives me a positive feeling 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.479
 but now a little bit for me 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.729
 worse, and I look at you 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.110
 in and you are my fans for me 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.340
 that's just a nice thing and 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.090
 I just wanted to do that again 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:34.409
 just say thank you yes we come directly 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.250
 to the tuning I do that always is so 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.590
 that never tuning looks like this 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:44.840
 I want that lee the big one 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:48.350
 Here's is the dgnb front page 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.970
 and then you hit first at 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.850
 you realize that sounds very different 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.170
 as if so the normal training would be 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.159
 of course now but not that 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.320
 So now that's a bit on 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.009
 a bit horny actually 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.210
 to say otherwise honestly I want 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.179
 first at the e string at the 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.140
 the front page is burdensome for today that is 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.629
 so to speak, the first thing you ever did 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.470
 so you can just practice the sides of that 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.599
 then perhaps a so 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.860
 a little more often because you practice or 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.150
 just a little bit of feeling for it 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.180
 because I do not want to 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.690
 Post a lot at once 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.450
 subscribe to my channel here and can 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.980
 also so direct and so and there I am glad 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.569
 me a bit on the feedback and 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.470
 then I'll show you the next pages 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.470
 take care
