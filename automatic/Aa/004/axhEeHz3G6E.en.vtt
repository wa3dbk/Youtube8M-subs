00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
trying to do them slowly but surely but

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.780 
trying to do them slowly but surely but
it's<00:02:16.520> gonna<00:02:17.210> take<00:02:17.450> some<00:02:17.480> time

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
it's gonna take some time

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.780
