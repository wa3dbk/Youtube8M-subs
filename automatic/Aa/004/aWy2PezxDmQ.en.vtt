old tailings piles and the miners that
worked<00:04:25.630> this<00:04:25.780> Creek<00:04:26.050> originally<00:04:26.590> they<00:04:27.520> stack

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
worked this Creek originally they stack

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.190 
worked this Creek originally they stack
the<00:04:28.000> rocks<00:04:28.210> over<00:04:28.420> here<00:04:28.690> they<00:04:28.870> pulled<00:04:29.080> all

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
the rocks over here they pulled all

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.700 
the rocks over here they pulled all
these<00:04:29.350> big<00:04:29.530> boulders<00:04:29.890> out<00:04:31.020> there's<00:04:32.020> one<00:04:32.290> there

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
these big boulders out there's one there

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.220 
these big boulders out there's one there
all<00:04:32.860> there's<00:04:33.130> a<00:04:33.160> big<00:04:33.310> stack<00:04:33.610> of<00:04:33.790> them<00:04:33.850> here<00:04:34.230> and

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
all there's a big stack of them here and

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.520 
all there's a big stack of them here and
then<00:04:35.530> there's<00:04:35.710> more<00:04:36.900> going<00:04:37.900> all<00:04:38.110> back<00:04:38.290> through

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
then there's more going all back through

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.650 
then there's more going all back through
there<00:04:39.420> but<00:04:41.490> so<00:04:42.490> the<00:04:42.610> creeks<00:04:42.880> moved<00:04:43.120> about<00:04:43.360> 10

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
there but so the creeks moved about 10

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:51.090 
there but so the creeks moved about 10
feet<00:04:43.900> so<00:04:44.080> it's<00:04:44.170> the<00:04:44.260> time<00:04:44.470> they<00:04:44.680> want

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.610 

maybe<00:04:52.100> a<00:04:52.190> little<00:04:52.370> bit<00:04:52.550> more<00:04:52.960> these<00:04:53.960> stats<00:04:54.350> are

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
maybe a little bit more these stats are

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.160 
maybe a little bit more these stats are
all<00:04:54.770> throughout<00:04:55.070> this<00:04:55.370> area<00:04:55.780> there's<00:04:56.780> more<00:04:57.020> of
