you<00:00:16.680> start<00:00:16.920> shooting<00:00:17.130> I<00:00:17.430> like<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.760> shoot<00:00:17.940> on

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
you start shooting I like to shoot on

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.880 
you start shooting I like to shoot on
one<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.449> corners<00:00:21.470> shoot<00:00:22.470> on<00:00:22.590> one<00:00:22.740> of<00:00:22.769> the

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
one of the corners shoot on one of the

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.160 
one of the corners shoot on one of the
corners<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.430> then<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.359> just<00:00:24.660> continuous

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
corners and then you just continuous

00:00:25.170 --> 00:01:42.660 
corners and then you just continuous
beat<00:00:25.350> all<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.619> way<00:00:25.710> around

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.940 

it<00:01:43.119> is<00:01:43.240> ok<00:01:43.540> to<00:01:43.570> stop<00:01:43.930> on<00:01:44.110> one<00:01:44.350> of<00:01:44.470> the<00:01:44.560> corners

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
it is ok to stop on one of the corners

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.010 
it is ok to stop on one of the corners
just<00:01:45.189> make<00:01:46.030> sure<00:01:46.240> when<00:01:46.420> you're<00:01:46.540> continuously

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
just make sure when you're continuously

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.200 
just make sure when you're continuously
when<00:01:47.290> you<00:01:47.380> do<00:01:47.500> the<00:01:47.590> continuous<00:01:48.040> bead<00:01:48.220> you<00:01:48.909> run

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
when you do the continuous bead you run

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.380 
when you do the continuous bead you run
that<00:01:49.479> beat<00:01:49.780> evenly<00:01:50.350> all<00:01:50.560> the<00:01:50.619> way<00:01:50.830> down<00:01:51.360> now<00:01:52.360> I

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
that beat evenly all the way down now I

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.850 
that beat evenly all the way down now I
just<00:01:52.509> need<00:01:52.780> the<00:01:52.930> bottom<00:01:53.229> portion<00:01:53.409> of<00:01:53.710> the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
just need the bottom portion of the

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:37.980 
just need the bottom portion of the
glass

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:44.670 

that's<00:02:38.990> it

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.930 

the<00:02:45.680> glue<00:02:45.920> is<00:02:46.069> going<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.250> be<00:02:46.400> a<00:02:46.430> quarter-inch

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
the glue is going to be a quarter-inch

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.510 
the glue is going to be a quarter-inch
off<00:02:47.240> the<00:02:47.420> edge<00:02:47.569> on<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:47.900> inside<00:02:48.290> as<00:02:48.590> you<00:02:49.340> can

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
off the edge on the inside as you can

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.500 
off the edge on the inside as you can
see<00:02:50.110> around<00:02:51.110> the<00:02:51.410> perimeter<00:02:52.300> pretty<00:02:53.300> much<00:02:53.480> a

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
see around the perimeter pretty much a

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.860 
see around the perimeter pretty much a
perfect<00:02:53.840> beat<00:02:54.110> all<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.410> way<00:02:54.500> around<00:02:55.600> this<00:02:56.600> is

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
perfect beat all the way around this is

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.830 
perfect beat all the way around this is
where<00:02:57.110> we<00:02:57.350> stopped<00:02:57.740> and<00:02:58.520> then<00:02:58.970> continued<00:02:59.600> see

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
where we stopped and then continued see

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.229 
where we stopped and then continued see
how<00:02:59.989> even<00:03:00.319> that<00:03:00.470> is<00:03:00.640> you<00:03:01.640> continue<00:03:02.060> all<00:03:02.209> the

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
how even that is you continue all the

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:07.180 
how even that is you continue all the
way<00:03:02.420> along<00:03:05.350> this<00:03:06.350> is<00:03:06.410> the<00:03:06.590> other<00:03:06.770> corner<00:03:07.040> where

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
way along this is the other corner where

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.820 
way along this is the other corner where
I<00:03:07.220> started<00:03:07.840> so<00:03:08.840> I<00:03:08.870> have<00:03:08.989> two<00:03:09.170> joints<00:03:09.620> and<00:03:09.770> I

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
I started so I have two joints and I

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.740 
I started so I have two joints and I
made<00:03:10.010> sure<00:03:10.040> that<00:03:10.489> there<00:03:10.640> are<00:03:10.819> there's<00:03:11.209> no<00:03:11.420> gaps

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
made sure that there are there's no gaps

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.380 
made sure that there are there's no gaps
in<00:03:11.959> between<00:03:12.580> we<00:03:13.580> will<00:03:13.760> be<00:03:13.880> decking<00:03:14.270> this

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
in between we will be decking this

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.340 
in between we will be decking this
window<00:03:14.750> in<00:03:14.870> a<00:03:14.959> minute<00:03:15.290> so<00:03:15.860> you<00:03:15.950> can<00:03:16.130> see<00:03:17.350> the

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
window in a minute so you can see the

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.250 
window in a minute so you can see the
finished<00:03:18.650> product<00:03:19.239> and<00:03:20.239> that<00:03:20.750> is<00:03:20.930> a<00:03:20.959> full

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
finished product and that is a full

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.259 
finished product and that is a full
window<00:03:21.590> with<00:03:21.739> the<00:03:21.860> glue<00:03:22.040> already<00:03:22.400> on<00:03:22.519> it<00:03:22.700> we

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
window with the glue already on it we

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.380 
window with the glue already on it we
like<00:03:23.480> to<00:03:23.660> use<00:03:23.780> suction<00:03:24.260> cups<00:03:24.790> for<00:03:25.790> the<00:03:25.850> install

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
like to use suction cups for the install

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.850 
like to use suction cups for the install
I<00:03:26.630> know<00:03:26.900> it's<00:03:27.140> going<00:03:27.230> to<00:03:27.290> be<00:03:27.380> a<00:03:27.470> little<00:03:27.769> bit

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
I know it's going to be a little bit

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.559 
I know it's going to be a little bit
difficult<00:03:28.040> if<00:03:28.400> you<00:03:28.519> do<00:03:28.640> not<00:03:28.760> have<00:03:29.090> suction

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
difficult if you do not have suction

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.320 
difficult if you do not have suction
cups<00:03:29.780> but<00:03:30.620> you<00:03:31.220> can<00:03:31.400> grab<00:03:31.670> the<00:03:31.819> edge<00:03:31.970> of<00:03:32.239> the

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
cups but you can grab the edge of the

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.240 
cups but you can grab the edge of the
glass<00:03:32.510> very<00:03:32.840> carefully<00:03:33.380> without<00:03:33.470> smearing<00:03:34.100> I

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
glass very carefully without smearing I

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.850 
glass very carefully without smearing I
do<00:03:34.550> recommend<00:03:35.090> using<00:03:35.510> suction<00:03:35.900> cups<00:03:38.680> we<00:03:39.680> will

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
do recommend using suction cups we will

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:49.250 
do recommend using suction cups we will
be<00:03:39.980> deck<00:03:40.160> in<00:03:40.340> a<00:03:40.430> glass<00:03:40.640> now

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.619 

the<00:03:49.709> suction<00:03:50.040> cups<00:03:50.220> are<00:03:50.370> easier<00:03:50.640> to<00:03:50.790> use<00:03:51.000> and

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629 
the suction cups are easier to use and

00:03:51.629 --> 00:04:55.900 
the suction cups are easier to use and
this<00:03:51.810> is<00:03:51.959> a<00:03:52.050> two-man<00:03:52.349> operation

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.680 

and<00:04:56.910> this<00:04:57.840> is<00:04:57.960> the<00:04:58.050> window<00:04:58.290> fully<00:04:58.590> installed

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
and this is the window fully installed

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.410 
and this is the window fully installed
if<00:05:00.690> you<00:05:01.470> do<00:05:01.620> have<00:05:01.830> excess<00:05:02.490> glue<00:05:02.820> coming<00:05:03.180> off

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
if you do have excess glue coming off

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.930 
if you do have excess glue coming off
the<00:05:03.630> perimeter<00:05:03.870> clean<00:05:04.800> it<00:05:04.950> off<00:05:05.100> as<00:05:05.340> quickly<00:05:05.670> as

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
the perimeter clean it off as quickly as

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.460 
the perimeter clean it off as quickly as
you<00:05:06.060> can

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
you can

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.530 
you can
because<00:05:07.950> when<00:05:08.130> the<00:05:08.250> glue<00:05:08.430> gets<00:05:08.640> hard<00:05:08.880> you<00:05:09.120> can

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
because when the glue gets hard you can

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.120 
because when the glue gets hard you can
cut<00:05:09.750> it<00:05:09.900> off<00:05:09.990> but<00:05:10.320> it's<00:05:10.470> easier<00:05:10.680> to<00:05:10.770> clean<00:05:10.950> when

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
cut it off but it's easier to clean when

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.000 
cut it off but it's easier to clean when
it's<00:05:11.310> still<00:05:12.120> kind<00:05:12.360> of<00:05:12.450> wet<00:05:12.660> the<00:05:13.380> curing<00:05:13.830> time

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
it's still kind of wet the curing time

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.160 
it's still kind of wet the curing time
on<00:05:14.160> the<00:05:14.250> glue<00:05:14.430> is<00:05:14.490> usually<00:05:14.910> about<00:05:15.120> an<00:05:15.390> hour<00:05:15.660> to

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.170 
on the glue is usually about an hour to

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:22.370 
on the glue is usually about an hour to
two<00:05:16.460> depending<00:05:17.460> on<00:05:17.550> your<00:05:17.700> humidity<00:05:21.170> to<00:05:22.170> clean
