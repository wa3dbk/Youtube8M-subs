00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.130
 great desire for all the boys 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.750
 Christmas is here today for the first time 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.520
 time on this channel 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.279
 today I have a double nuclear goal 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.040
 at 94 with rapid handle loader 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.540
 I'm not here today to talk about 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.330
 gameplay despite being a double core 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.640
 that I see quite a few, I know 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.559
 which is not said in Italy but more than that 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.930
 others are here to talk to you about new ones 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.360
 of the medical lcd moby that is about to come out 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.280
 on call of duty black ops two I don't talk 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.340
 of the four camouflage or cyber 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.090
 dragon sandwiches comics book that I am already 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.040
 output on xbox 360 that as usual 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.550
 they will come out they will still have to come out on ps3 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:56.190
 but I speak of another dlc camoes 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.559
 that is mimetic lcd that knowing how to get out 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.579
 su call of duty which includes 10 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.860
 movements that l have a thing in 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.290
 particularly this dlc because there will be 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.810
 not all mythical animates 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.789
 obviously but two in particular that 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.060
 they are as animated as I have already told you 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:16.470
 the electric hook and the color charging 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.970
 sorry the pronunciation is not English 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.479
 so I don't know production very well 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.909
 anyway 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.700
 I'm really very pretty in my opinion 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.140
 because we treat them however I say in 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.120
 english because still in italy not 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.760
 would be 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.710
 and electric camouflage is not yet known 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.280
 will translate the call-of-duty producers 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.560
 however it is a camouflage where we will see 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.270
 all the current shock 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.580
 go through the weapon and I think it's one 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.110
 very innovative and very beautiful 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.670
 especially to be introduced in call of 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.010
 duty where they have never been present 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.620
 movements that so animated while 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.410
 color charging and will be a camouflage 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.600
 quite simple though animated or 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.870
 that meanwhile here migration host as al 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.270
 usually that will change color every 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:03.800
 so much at random the colors of this one 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:06.440
 camouflage are yellow red purple and blue and 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.820
 it will change blue light in short it will change 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.980
 maybe my color is lying down 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.440
 I think this mythical is very pretty 

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:14.120
 the trailer for these has not yet been released 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.820
 movements that on call of duty ma da 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.830
 reliable sources you can see that 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.600
 they will come out you can also pass maybe by 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.310
 some American channels where they do them 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.770
 see also the images of the mythical 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.360
 with some bits of my video anyway 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.450
 other camouflage cars are blue 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.930
 tailleur camo that as we understand from 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.530
 name will be a blue and blue camouflage 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.080
 with the eti 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.420
 tiger stripes obviously then there 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.000
 it will be the iss lucano that I think it is 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.640
 already been made in black ops a then 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.220
 I think it will be the same introduced in 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.040
 call of duty black ops 2 or it will be one 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.380
 simple ice color camouflage color 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.150
 light blue pretty simple 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.720
 obviously also pretty nice me 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.120
 liked very much in black ops 1 anyway 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.970
 another limit that will be his ma camo 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.430
 do not ask yourself why it is called so e 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:09.300
 I don't even know if it is pronounced chicken 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.730
 well that it will be a light and dark green a 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.470
 mo of mimetic precisely classic 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.340
 camouflage that can also be seen in 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.769
 movie 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.170
 then there will be the camo nevada that like it 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:23.459
 can also understand a little from the name is made 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:27.150
 the brownish ways desert together with the 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:29.220
 it will be camo that is just like 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.709
 indeed to the desert it will be for whom 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.090
 did not know I do not know who but anyway 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.660
 for those who do not know a name of a 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.690
 desert 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.480
 yes yes I know I am very intelligent and there 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:43.170
 it will be the cam suit that it will also be 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.269
 Striped in the shape of a tiger shaped 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.610
 tiger like a tiger and le 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.890
 I don't know if you have born y stripes 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.049
 imagine it this way on a weapon 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.150
 time it will be orange black since not 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.760
 it is not written but blue tiger field but 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.120
 simply sawyer camo and it seems to me that 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.879
 also 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.890
 already present on black ops 1 and then 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:05.470
 I think that in this dlc we 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.030
 made even more to add 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.970
 mimetic which were much liked 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:14.470
 on black ops 1 then there will be flora 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:17.139
 camus which is green plus brown green 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.650
 light and dark plus brown always a 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:22.960
 mimetic worlds a particular practice 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.240
 that I am unable to register is the 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.220
 little panci camus for those who did not know that 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.560
 what the pack with pancho pur'esso shooting 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:33.070
 a real bullshit however is camouflage 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.510
 there's the zombie deal here, of course 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.850
 this channel treats a lot of zombies which 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:40.120
 you will all know that it strengthens the weapons and 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:42.370
 so I do n't think he still has a 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.560
 color like that because if I'm not mistaken he has 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.229
 a color towards the light gray the pack 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.660
 a punch but a very strange blue color 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:52.030
 green all a mixture not by way of 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.680
 bioethics but just all confusion 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.590
 that nothing is understood for this reason 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:05:01.210
 ve know well describe, however, then there 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:03.880
 there will be enough there are no more limits than that 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.569
 however my favorites of this dlc 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.189
 obviously if not 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:08.360
 you did not understand my description well 

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:10.399
 of the skin as well to see seek 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.009
 American teletext that already exists 

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:16.009
 a couple are the electric kamla color 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:18.050
 charging obviously I think who had it 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:19.580
 guessed he would have suffered 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.529
 understood that these were the two because e 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.559
 as I said before, they are animated 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:27.559
 and it seems pretty nice to me 

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:29.360
 however in this black ops two vi 

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:31.759
 you will be aware that they have added many 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.559
 mimetic and wanted to talk about 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:36.229
 this never write me comment if you are 

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:39.020
 agree with my reasoning that 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:41.119
 which I'm going to tell you again they have 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.520
 added many camouflage which ghost 

00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:45.199
 that for those who do not yet know how 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.879
 do you need to order 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:48.259
 game and in the receipt write you a 

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:49.159
 code to insert in playstation 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:50.869
 network 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:54.680
 and so you unlock the camouflage but 

00:05:50.869 --> 00:05:56.449
 however in my opinion it was not much 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.800
 just adding these moments that 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:00.050
 or that I'm glad that 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.089
 they arrived but I would have preferred that 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.610
 were already included at the beginning of the game 

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:06.619
 it is true that he still has a game done 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.249
 to make money of course now you know that 

00:06:06.619 --> 00:06:09.120
 call of Duty 

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:11.490
 I don't want to create one 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.800
 a war of comments to say that 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:16.840
 call of duty is nice stuff like that but 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.699
 now gt drop is that 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.380
 we always expect something a lot 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:21.760
 beautiful and innovative in the new call of 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.270
 duty but in reality it is always the same 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.639
 thing 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:27.130
 this because they see us anyway 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:29.530
 like it enough though they fail 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:32.169
 maybe to understand the mistakes to improve 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:34.479
 but here it is always the same stuff and 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:37.540
 so it was a very snowy thing either 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:39.850
 add these medical but in my opinion 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.970
 it would have been fairer also to part 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:44.440
 of the producers compared to us players 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:47.229
 introduce them directly to the exit of the 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.389
 non-paying game of course but 

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:50.830
 this now I think they will do it again 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:53.500
 also in call of big duty ie 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:55.900
 add me medical because anyway 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:58.060
 camouflage are quite beautiful and me 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.680
 like others of you bought them 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.960
 so they saw that they manage to do 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.150
 money well with this method and therefore the 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:07.080
 here will introduce let me know maybe 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:09.160
 in the comments if you think it is right 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:11.740
 this thing they did though 

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.570
 add new myths that dlc dlc is true 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.400
 they were right they had already been introduced 

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:17.229
 even in the past in the past codmas 

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.660
 however this time it was added 

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:21.250
 even a weapon that if you didn't have it 

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:23.020
 at the beginning of the exit of that weapon was 

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:24.280
 really strong they have now passed it 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:27.010
 she had become a little more disgusting 

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.990
 anyway I'm sorry if maybe not 

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:31.000
 you did not like to comment very much 

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.320
 if you liked it instead if you liked it 

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.240
 the past gameplay of my channel where 

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.039
 you will find many that pinelli call of duty 

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.349
 I also started a series of zombies 

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:40.539
 so if you want to go see nothing 

00:07:38.349 --> 00:07:42.550
 guys i am finished i hope you like it 

00:07:40.539 --> 00:07:44.500
 you enjoyed excusing me if it is so 

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:47.870
 leave a nice like and nothing 

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:50.870
 guys I finished them shot 

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:50.870
 no
