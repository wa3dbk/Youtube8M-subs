00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.109
 hello I am here after the week 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:09.240
 it is not in any way because it is not 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.780
 not bundled with the themes of the umh and 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:16.320
 that and because I have a problem when 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.830
 I made the schlinder comes that I had 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.310
 promised in employment since it turns out 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.890
 that he came to me in the recording 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.619
 but not only to capture the screen 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.880
 game will sound desk 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.469
 computer 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.809
 so if anyone can tell me how 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.399
 can i fix or how can i get it back 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.260
 it would only appear much because the 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.760
 boarding has been done well and I want 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:48.480
 repeat it again so nothing are going to 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:53.540
 start with the unboxing of the new iphone 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:58.930
 5 of 16 gigabytes 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.930
 that I really wanted to try it 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:11.710
 well here you see it 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.710
 the 4 inch screen 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:18.210
 it weighs very little is very light and you see what 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:22.430
 finite that is 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:25.120
 down here you have the 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.190
 the speakers 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:31.020
 you enter the 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:34.020
 of the headphones and the new connector 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.020
 lighting 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.340
 here on one side of where it would look down 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.159
 the volume 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.159
 and the other input of the Information Society 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:52.960
 and well you see that super nice 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.960
 and 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.240
 Y 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.250
 in this envelope come and the typical 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.250
 stickers 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.090
 the fast life and guarantees 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:24.420
 and here we have the charger 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.910
 the cable with which you have worked 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:40.250
 the cable with the usb and the connector 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:43.280
 lighting that is smaller than the 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.210
 previous and it's reversible because you can 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.210
 connect both this side and this 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.210
 tiny 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:57.170

00:02:53.080 --> 00:03:01.660

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:05.240
 the new apple headphones that 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:08.030
 they have up to three speakers 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:12.310
 with a new orientation so that it 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.310
 listen to high definition 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:20.270
 They are very cool 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:24.590

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:29.030
