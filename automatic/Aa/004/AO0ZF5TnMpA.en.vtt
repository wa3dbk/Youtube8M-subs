00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
Oklahoma blade and this is a heart

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.330 
Oklahoma blade and this is a heart
that's<00:02:05.750> a<00:02:05.840> heart<00:02:06.110> thumper<00:02:06.560> right<00:02:06.950> now<00:02:07.159> it's<00:02:07.280> a

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
that's a heart thumper right now it's a

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.130 
that's a heart thumper right now it's a
combination<00:02:07.759> see<00:02:08.209> those<00:02:08.390> two<00:02:08.630> blades<00:02:08.899> how

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
combination see those two blades how

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.359 
combination see those two blades how
they're<00:02:09.320> actually<00:02:09.649> together<00:02:10.040> now<00:02:10.250> we're

little bit about these now I was
changing<00:02:15.320> the<00:02:15.410> action<00:02:15.860> sometimes<00:02:16.489> you<00:02:16.820> get

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
changing the action sometimes you get

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.740 
changing the action sometimes you get
into<00:02:17.780> certain<00:02:17.989> areas<00:02:18.470> you<00:02:18.500> want<00:02:18.829> this<00:02:18.950> to<00:02:19.750> have

more<00:02:21.049> of<00:02:21.079> a<00:02:21.260> vibration<00:02:21.940> and<00:02:22.940> you<00:02:22.970> can<00:02:23.209> even

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
more of a vibration and you can even

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.470 
more of a vibration and you can even
make<00:02:23.570> it<00:02:23.600> like<00:02:24.140> flutter<00:02:24.769> down<00:02:25.010> like<00:02:25.310> a

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
make it like flutter down like a

make it like flutter down like a
helicoptering<00:02:26.480> it's<00:02:26.660> called<00:02:26.959> where<00:02:27.230> if<00:02:27.350> it's

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
helicoptering it's called where if it's

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.659 
helicoptering it's called where if it's
a<00:02:27.590> little<00:02:27.739> deeper<00:02:28.160> and<00:02:28.280> you<00:02:28.370> want<00:02:28.549> it<00:02:28.639> to

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:28.669 
a little deeper and you want it to

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:30.190 
a little deeper and you want it to
helicopter<00:02:29.359> off<00:02:29.419> the<00:02:29.570> edges<00:02:29.720> and<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:30.049> way<00:02:30.169> I

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
helicopter off the edges and the way I

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.880 
helicopter off the edges and the way I
do<00:02:30.320> that

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
do that

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.400 
do that
I'll<00:02:31.160> take<00:02:31.460> this<00:02:31.640> arm<00:02:32.000> and<00:02:32.390> I<00:02:32.720> Bend<00:02:33.140> that<00:02:33.350> arm

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
I'll take this arm and I Bend that arm

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.160 
I'll take this arm and I Bend that arm
out<00:02:33.950> so<00:02:34.190> that<00:02:34.340> it's<00:02:34.490> a<00:02:34.610> wider<00:02:34.940> profile<00:02:35.690> and

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
out so that it's a wider profile and

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.110 
out so that it's a wider profile and
that<00:02:36.350> causes<00:02:36.800> the<00:02:36.920> played<00:02:37.130> the<00:02:37.310> helicopter

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
that causes the played the helicopter

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.300 
that causes the played the helicopter
down<00:02:38.330> rather<00:02:38.810> than<00:02:39.020> come<00:02:39.770> through<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.130> water

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
down rather than come through the water

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.040 
down rather than come through the water
faster<00:02:40.580> now<00:02:40.910> if<00:02:41.000> you<00:02:41.120> want<00:02:41.330> to<00:02:41.420> work<00:02:41.570> the<00:02:41.750> pads

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
faster now if you want to work the pads

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.080 
faster now if you want to work the pads
you're<00:02:42.800> working<00:02:43.100> vegetation<00:02:43.790> you<00:02:43.850> want<00:02:44.000> to

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
you're working vegetation you want to

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.850 
you're working vegetation you want to
move<00:02:44.210> it<00:02:44.360> a<00:02:44.420> little<00:02:44.690> quicker<00:02:44.990> you<00:02:45.590> don't<00:02:45.740> have

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
move it a little quicker you don't have

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.470 
move it a little quicker you don't have
all<00:02:46.010> that<00:02:46.160> resistance<00:02:46.670> I<00:02:46.820> just<00:02:47.030> bend<00:02:47.300> those

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
all that resistance I just bend those

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.660 
all that resistance I just bend those
arms<00:02:47.780> right<00:02:48.290> back<00:02:48.560> in<00:02:48.860> again<00:02:48.980> now<00:02:49.280> you<00:02:49.340> notice
