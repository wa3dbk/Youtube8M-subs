00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.680
 for gluteal augmentation surgery the 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.750
 doctor roberto tribaldos used fat 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.509
 of the patient's body the same 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.120
 He obtained using liposuction let 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.540
 to do the infiltration of the solution 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.540
 of klein 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.800
 and then do the infiltration we were 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.420
 around between 15 to 20 minutes before 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.119
 start liposuction to give time 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.130
 that the medicines that are 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.500
 introduced along with the solution 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.540
 produce the result we are looking for 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.580
 we proceed to start the liposuction of 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.850
 the areas we introduce the cannula into this 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:40.559
 case a cannula number 4 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.559
 and we are going to start liposuction 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.100
 so the fat should come out ideally as 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.660
 can see without any content of 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.220
 blood 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.980
 this surgery does not require hospitalization 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.989
 and the results are optimal and safe 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.489
 the plastic surgeon recommended

 artificial fillings that can 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.010
 cause them severe damage as usual 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.630
 what infiltrates are biopolymers of 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.150
 the biopolymers there is a great variety 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.530
 what happens with biopolymers is like 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.259
 throw a coin to the air 50% of the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.350

 redness infections perforations 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:47.380
 buttocks there is a group of patients this 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:50.170
 that infiltrations are made around 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.100
 of 23 percent of these patients who 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.100
 they will develop 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.960
 an antibody antigen reaction 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.390
 important to be able to fix it 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.670

 obtained but by the natural and 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.890
 provided that the patient looks now 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.890
