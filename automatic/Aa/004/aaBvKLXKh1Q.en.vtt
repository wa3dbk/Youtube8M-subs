00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.250
 heavy 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.080
 the song is in an original tone is 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.910
 in an accordion of me today we are going to give 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.160
 on a peace accordion but if you 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:25.810
 you try with the same footsteps you're going to 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:29.070
 give the song almost the same very well 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.070
 it starts more or less here 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.410
 and 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.720
 very well is your principles trying 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.700
 a little bit more slowly starts 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.200
 here you support yourself with this finger you 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.200
