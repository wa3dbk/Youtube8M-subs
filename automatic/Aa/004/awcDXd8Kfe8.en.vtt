00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:10.129
 today at the Carthage Palace 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:11.239
 this kind of things 

00:00:11.239 --> 00:00:14.979
 why have they so they will believe on your behalf our cameras 

00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:18.710
 so I'm not talking about the compact flash card that has an elite team 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.230
 last professional chassemy reflex as we see some 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.369
 less and less 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.509
 but it's mostly about this little map the map sd 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.859
 here is the motherboard that we will find almost everywhere in all 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:30.949
 cameras 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:32.920
 the compact reflex 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.320
 at twenty-four bodies so the map sd is the one that is the most widespread 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.170
 how does the marriage work between a camera to peace a map 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.000
 memory 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.420
 what you need to know is when you take a picture with your camera 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.560
 a video 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.210
 e all these elements the bce are stored 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.210
 in a buffer of your camera 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.610
 our camera a year a term a memory 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.780
 so and all this information will be stored in this memory 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.220
 so it is obvious that this element will be more or less great function of 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.410
 your camera 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.780
 it takes all these data are stored in the buffer they are 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.950
 sent 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.610
 who does not like storing them 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.180
 so that's where it's important to have the light district as well 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.740
 quick 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.610
 that the buffer sends the data 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.630
 because if you have a card that does not write fast enough so what will happen 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.390
 to pass is that we will arrive as in the sound of a funnel will know 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.880
 other things that happen 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.400
 it's a press release 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.840
 no, what makes your camera work 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.490
 you will not be able to take pictures anymore 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.479
 what are blocked to him but I write me I write your name of Christ for 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.530
 own account 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.330
 so we could support you are who seeing red who will all work in 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.330
 permanently you have to wait 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.670
 as beautiful à la carte 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.550
 I finished writing everything that send the buffer 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.790
 that's where it's important to have a map 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.220
 as fast 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.090
 that sending data the buffer 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.710
 sometimes even more for them 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.230
 more comfortable more leisurely 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.630
 so how does it work what you need to know is that your card 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.860
 she's going to have because writing 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.940
 then applied since the different classes the savoie the classes of 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.320
 class 4 classy asia 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.779
 it's all a map 

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:10.489
 which is class 10 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.019
 so classes what does that mean is the minimum speed 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:15.329
 writing so that's often make it 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.179
 we are the speed below 

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:20.159
 for that the slowest we can find alone with this map 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:20.729
 the 

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:23.919
 so here in this case a piece of ID will be 10 mega per second 

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:25.639
 these minimum writing speed 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:27.659
 a waterfall it will be 4 mega 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.179
 per second minimum speed of the future 

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:33.569
 to acquit himself exercise five small wanted to have an idea of ​​the map 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.389
 you must have for your device if your device credits 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:38.139
 photo of 3 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:40.500
 so that's why to find out what weight 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.979
 or for a photo of her on your computer 

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:46.529
 in fact a little right click on the file jpg small one of the photos 

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:48.759
 naughty been made not your device 

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:52.189
 and you do the information on the file for the final podium to calm 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:55.229
 everybody nico to egypt she who spend three regattas 

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:58.629
 so it's not your camera it's a photo so it's not chic three media 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:59.549
 incoming 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.320
 so you already know the basis that 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.370
 minimum 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.829
 writing per second is too much media 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:06.120
 so here in this case 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.649
 clasquin will not suffice 

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:11.599
 on the other hand class 4 for 3 mega will perhaps be a little fair so not all 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:12.139
 naked 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:14.199
 take that six points quieter 

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:15.539
 card trotter 

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:18.769
 it can be the most can the least it is better not to be too fair because 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.199
 that you will be always celebrating 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:23.239
 so we believe the place above so you're quiet 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.969
 anyway from an Iraq joint venture 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:28.389
 with all today's digital SLRs it's better to take 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:31.479
 class 10 like that you will not be bothered you will be quiet for 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:34.259
 evolve as fine changed appearance 

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:37.409
 so what I have is that if you have a camera that does help 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:39.749
 station 3d pictures 

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:42.649
 so you know that the minimum speed of writing his three best so I 

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:45.249
 say class four but classicism 

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:49.939
 then if your camera that finally say the engine 2 4 liters per 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:52.239
 second so these four times 3 billion 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:53.899
 do you see all 

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:56.559
 per second in maximum write speed 

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:58.609
 so that gives us two important information that we need 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:00.029
 pass 

00:04:00.029 --> 00:04:03.730
 the minimum writing speed 3 megas in this case the maximum speed 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:06.529
 baptized 12 

00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:08.709
 I know that with this card 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.779
 light 45 'mediapart seconds maximum 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:14.489
 so I know that 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.799
 I'll be able 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.199
 I have a minimum write speed of 10 megawatts 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.289
 a maximum speed of 45 billion muscatels 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.139
 per 100 inhabitants for example if I was jdd photos of kate mega 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:31.139
 but I can burst 10 frames per second 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.740
 they are close to 40 m² goes up to 45 billion 

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:38.860
 what you should know also hoisted in terms of 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.099
 the abilities 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:42.939
 so we have a nose and sdhc 

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:45.900
 dismissed at all short that will make him gicat I believe 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.080
 the spare parts that she goes to choral h that's why abilities that 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.139
 will go up to 32 gigas 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.120
 and does he know that they will go up to 128 cases even announce 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.009
 iron character 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:00.599
 the recent good for gold has not yet 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:04.349
 so for the capacity cards the dhc 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:07.530
 check that other devices compatible with this format 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:08.740
 with this standard 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.130
 because all the boxes are not at the moment sometimes it takes the 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.229
 bad surprise to read a sdhc card and take it to the device 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:17.309
 see that the card is not recognized 

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:19.439
 so check systematically 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:22.439
 that your device accept sdhc format 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:24.060
 heller 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.309
 same for the injury suffered 

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:30.319
 three tons of capacity I think the cepal that can the most can the least 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:33.169
 but to a single nuance anyway it's that 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:36.479
 if you have too big a gap if you use 16 of 32 gigas 

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:38.240
 % 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.970
 challenge you if you forget your cards once every six months you have a 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.250
 shootings that is full permanently and that you please or twice a year 

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:47.400
 if ever your card 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.759
 a problem is which plant you lose all your photos 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:54.490
 it's still a shame to encourage more to have spread a little smaller 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.479
 and then say more regularly 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:59.580
 so that's still an assurance of being able to keep his pictures of pavant 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:00.680
 of losses in case of problem 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.229
 we have three minutes before having a minimum 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:06.379
 so always could have avoided always having too big cases 

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:09.870
 abilities and let the TV images inside think well empty 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.349
 regularly 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:14.779
 I see again for memory cards that could be said 

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:17.379
 generally 

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:20.599
 if you have doubts do not hesitate to go 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:22.419
 in a photography shop 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:25.689
 isuppli who is asked questions to the seller bring your box tested the 

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:26.699
 cards 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:28.039
 it's important for them 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:31.229
 you can from this opportunity ask your entourage also if the 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:33.099
 people have cards of the year 

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:34.969
 asked they tracked questerre 

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:37.279
 these people of devices that goes so other 

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:39.460
 it can be something interesting 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:44.139
 for 100 th also avoid yara general do not buy card with mark 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:44.889
 unknown 

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:46.830
 the two models of exotic brands 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.680
 rates that are really very low 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.539
 when it's too low in fact not a case to follow 

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:55.899
 because the level of memory cards to counterfeit 

00:06:55.899 --> 00:06:57.180
 by his father too 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.460
 so beware 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.089
 sometimes bad cards damage your camera 

00:07:01.089 --> 00:07:02.979
 so be careful too 

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:05.379
 on that side it's important 

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:08.039
 here I think I have 

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:12.719
 he's happy on the cards if ever I had had and percent and small 

00:07:12.719 --> 00:07:13.779
 deadlocks 

00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:15.879
 your work the previous month 

00:07:15.879 --> 00:07:18.739
 but if you have any additional information do not hesitate 

00:07:18.739 --> 00:07:20.809
 not to him 10 years in the comments 

00:07:20.809 --> 00:07:22.899
 I think like that everyone to enjoy 

00:07:22.899 --> 00:07:24.839
 for 100 euros 

00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:26.119
 p 

00:07:26.119 --> 00:07:27.189
 massa 

00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:30.330
 that it will put good in my speech and thankless cheeks in advance if you 

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.349
 have questions do not hesitate also use the comments 

00:07:33.349 --> 00:07:36.300
 register the director on the form here and there 

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.380
 like that you to be constantly informed a new video that 

00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:42.080
 were coming out of future products a good exit 

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.990
 how to photograph 

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:46.639
 thank you for following very closely
