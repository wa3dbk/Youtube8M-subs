I'm here making a video about it now the

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.460 
I'm here making a video about it now the
idea<00:00:29.910> behind<00:00:29.970> this<00:00:30.420> rotation<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.199> allows

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
idea behind this rotation is it allows

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.799 
idea behind this rotation is it allows

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
enemies which makes it especially potent

coil<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:46.800> Bahamut<00:00:46.850> let's<00:00:47.850> break<00:00:48.149> down<00:00:48.180> each

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
coil of Bahamut let's break down each

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.240 
coil of Bahamut let's break down each
step<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.170> this<00:00:49.320> rotation<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.010> we<00:00:50.129> can

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
step of this rotation so we can

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.610 
step of this rotation so we can
understand<00:00:50.850> what<00:00:50.969> makes<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:51.809> potent<00:00:52.320> so

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
understand what makes it so potent so

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.860 
understand what makes it so potent so
first<00:00:52.890> here's<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.610> rotation<00:00:54.090> just<00:00:54.420> type<00:00:54.690> that

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
first here's the rotation just type that

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.810 
first here's the rotation just type that
without<00:00:55.170> any<00:00:55.350> explanation<00:00:56.010> we<00:00:56.430> start<00:00:56.670> with<00:00:56.760> a

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
without any explanation we start with a

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.029 
without any explanation we start with a
fire<00:00:57.030> 3<00:00:57.449> before<00:00:57.930> immediately<00:00:58.320> going<00:00:58.770> into

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
fire 3 before immediately going into

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.119 
fire 3 before immediately going into
casting<00:00:59.250> 3<00:00:59.940> fire<00:01:00.420> tubes<00:01:00.840> follow<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.800> up<00:01:01.949> with

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
casting 3 fire tubes follow that up with

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.880 
casting 3 fire tubes follow that up with
a<00:01:02.309> hard<00:01:02.760> casting<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.449> flare<00:01:03.870> then<00:01:04.559> you'll<00:01:04.710> want

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
a hard casting a flare then you'll want

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.300 
a hard casting a flare then you'll want
to<00:01:04.920> hit<00:01:05.040> convert<00:01:05.339> swift<00:01:06.270> cast<00:01:06.540> flare

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
to hit convert swift cast flare

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.289 
to hit convert swift cast flare
transpose<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.549> then<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.119> tricky

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
transpose and then this is the tricky

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.630 
transpose and then this is the tricky
part<00:01:09.420> wait<00:01:10.200> for<00:01:10.380> your<00:01:10.500> MP<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.010> tick<00:01:11.220> back<00:01:11.400> up

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
part wait for your MP to tick back up

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.499 
part wait for your MP to tick back up
once<00:01:12.119> as<00:01:12.510> soon<00:01:12.570> as<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:12.930> does<00:01:13.080> count<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:14.070> 2<00:01:14.509> flare

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
once as soon as it does count to 2 flare

fire<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.409> flare<00:01:16.950> repeat<00:01:17.580> now<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.180> know<00:01:18.330> without

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
fire to flare repeat now I know without

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.990 
fire to flare repeat now I know without
any<00:01:18.840> context<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.740> seems<00:01:20.009> kind<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.340> weird<00:01:20.580> so

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
any context that seems kind of weird so

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.460 
any context that seems kind of weird so
let's<00:01:21.270> go<00:01:21.390> into<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.810> little<00:01:21.930> bit<00:01:22.140> more<00:01:22.290> in

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
let's go into it a little bit more in

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.530 
let's go into it a little bit more in
depth<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:23.400> we<00:01:23.520> start<00:01:23.759> this<00:01:23.850> rotation<00:01:24.360> with<00:01:24.509> the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
depth so we start this rotation with the

stacks once these stacks are on you want

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.819 
stacks once these stacks are on you want

those fire tubes before you cast flare

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.539 
those fire tubes before you cast flare
you<00:01:34.140> never<00:01:34.500> want<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.860> cast<00:01:35.040> flare<00:01:35.310> while

have some MP you're going to want to
count<00:03:43.200> to<00:03:43.379> 2<00:03:43.560> I<00:03:43.769> personally<00:03:44.459> do<00:03:44.640> it<00:03:44.760> out<00:03:44.940> loud

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
count to 2 I personally do it out loud

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.670 
count to 2 I personally do it out loud
just<00:03:45.239> to<00:03:45.720> make<00:03:45.930> sure<00:03:45.959> it<00:03:46.170> works<00:03:46.349> probably

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
just to make sure it works probably

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.130 
just to make sure it works probably
because<00:03:47.160> I'm<00:03:47.280> not<00:03:47.459> as<00:03:47.700> experienced<00:03:48.420> at<00:03:48.540> it<00:03:48.720> so

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
because I'm not as experienced at it so

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.199 
because I'm not as experienced at it so
yeah<00:03:49.349> count<00:03:49.769> to<00:03:49.950> 2<00:03:50.129> and<00:03:50.370> then<00:03:50.519> start<00:03:50.910> casting

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
yeah count to 2 and then start casting

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.330 
yeah count to 2 and then start casting

flare this should allow you to get the

smaller groups of 1 to 3 may be good for
practice<00:04:44.849> but<00:04:45.210> this<00:04:45.300> is<00:04:45.450> mostly<00:04:45.750> effective<00:04:46.229> on

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
practice but this is mostly effective on

practice but this is mostly effective on

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
enemies the better it gets go ahead and

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.370 
enemies the better it gets go ahead and
give<00:04:51.389> it<00:04:51.419> some<00:04:51.599> practice<00:04:51.960> and<00:04:52.050> let<00:04:52.169> me<00:04:52.260> know

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
give it some practice and let me know

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.719

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
to play a bit of me doing this rotation

so<00:05:04.889> you<00:05:05.010> can<00:05:05.160> see<00:05:05.310> what<00:05:05.490> it<00:05:05.580> will<00:05:05.669> look<00:05:05.849> like<00:05:05.910> in

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
so you can see what it will look like in

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.600 
so you can see what it will look like in
