00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.500
 1 2 3 when we see in today's video 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.570
 I will teach you the easiest way to 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.510
 download and install the shippuden gambling den 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.320
 ultimate ninja storm 3 fleas for the pc 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.090
 compatible with windows xp 7 and 8 as 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.130
 always the download link is 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.470
 you will find in the description of the video 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.720
 which will redirect you to my web page 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.879
 the only file they will need is the 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.540
 first which contains torrent del 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:38.610
 game 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.890
 the other file is a 6 gen of the game 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.260
 once downloaded the first radar what 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.660
 we extract on the desk the advice of 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.550
 my part is that if your antivirus is not the 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.520
 there is a possibility that 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.860
 can continue with the whole process and 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.260
 extracted the rare will find a read and 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.270
 a torrent file in the event that the 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.670
 running do not have left with this icon 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.410
 do the same thing as I speak two new 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.530
 tabs in your browser 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.780
 in the first write network and in the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.240
 second tab write diamond 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.770
 procuren download the programs 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.650
 the pages that show below 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.259
 or they can search for tutorials on youtube 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.810
 once both programs are installed in 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.729
 your pc we will proceed to double click 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.860
 about the torrent file after 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.409
 select the torrent they will appear a 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.540
 box like this make sure that the 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.970
 Selected boxes are the same 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.460
 who are watching in this video then 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.100
 to check all the boxes we give 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.090
 to ok and the floor unloading will begin 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.250
 of the game 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.440
 an anecdote on my part is that at 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.630
 time to download do not have programs 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.909
 who are using the internet even if it's 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.070
 background I tell you this so that your 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.229
 download faster a data 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.509
 important for those who do not know 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.399
 how the torrent works here is a 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.530
 brief description utorrent is a 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.810
 program that links the downloads of 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.850
 each user in real time this wants 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.130
 say that not only downloads of the 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.500
 james torrent servers but also 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.690
 from other PCs which allows you to 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.000
 pause your download and continue when 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.860
 have time to pause your download 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.580
 you just have to minimize the window and 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.160
 ready 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.440
 Once you have 100% in your download 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.570
 they will have a folder like this one with 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.730
 many files winrar what they should 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.800
 to do is to extract the first radar to 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.630
 that the iso of the game is generated 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.510
 the extraction will last long so 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.190
 have a little patience I will pass the 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.400
 video so it does not become too extensive 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.230
 [Music] 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.750
 once the extraction has 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.030
 finished we will have an iso file and 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.159
 this is where the tools daemon comes in 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.739
 will help us mount the iso on the pc 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:46.470
 simulating it as if it were a disk of 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.540
 true the process to mount the iso 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.700
 It may vary depending on the version 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.549
 that have downloaded but do not be alarmed 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.629
 It is a very simple process to learn 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.939
 already assembled and ready 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:59.489
 they will have a virtual CD unit with 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:01.680
 the icon of the game to emphasize what 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.180
 I said at the beginning of the video, deactivate 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.310
 antivirus in the event that the 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.250
 installation fails at first but if 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.440
 use avast do not worry to start 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.379
 the installation we give to playback 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.629
 automatic and execute the setup then 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.849
 to wait a while we will leave the option 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:21.209
 to choose the language we give to Spanish 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.980
 and then to accept next following it 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.709
 they fix it in installation 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.450
 recommended and then give it to next 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.600
 next deactivates in the first 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.880
 box and they give to next 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.620
 and finally you get to install this 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.840
 process will last long so they 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.030
 I recommend that they are going to be poured and 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.700
 do something else but do not try to do 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.980
 nothing on the pc or they will be worked on later 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.110
 of waiting for the whole process will appear 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.480
 this we deactivate the box and we give 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.340
 to finish now we would just miss 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.430
 put the crack to the game to have it 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.710
 Spanish fuliola the crack is located in the 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.270
 faire live folder 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.820
 now you have to copy the content of the 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.950
 game light folder to the root folder of the 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.590
 game do the same as me so that I do not 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.160
 get lost once you have replaced the 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:09.050
 file will already have your game installed 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.480
 it would only be necessary to adjust the configuration 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.290
 we give you right click and execute as 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.750
 administrator 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.509
 for those who believe they can not run 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.570
 the game 100% I recommend you 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:23.460
 lower the resolution of the game and in the 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.620
 command option allows you to choose 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.410
 between several options but in this 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.660
 occasion we will use the keyboard this process 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.759
 is independent of oneself but if 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.560
 want they can use the configuration that 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:37.199
 I put on the web page for them to 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.270
 serve as reference or help remember 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:41.460
 that to be able to save the configuration 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.350
 they have to run the game as 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.240
 administrator, I'll say it again because 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.940
 there is always someone to whom they pass 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.220
 even to me when I started playing and 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.110
 to conclude with the video I will show you 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.110
 the usual gameplay that I always do 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.449
 for every game I go up like a few 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.440
 months youtube has been fucking with what 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:00.509
 of copyright 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.370
 I'll cut this gameplay so I can 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:05.340
 see the highlights of this great 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.470
 I really like the game 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.539
 show them all the attacks that can 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.970
 perform the ones but it's naruto's 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:13.800
 very elusive so I will try to do 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.509
 everything possible to not kill Naruto 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.110
 to show you most of 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:18.110
 movements 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.950
 the susano is very useful as a rocker but 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.080
 It can be easily destroyed with 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.900
 several combos followed so you have to 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:30.240
 be careful this movement is the 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.870
 chaca career a very useful to be able 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.210
 perform remote attacks 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.580
 [Music] 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.710
 the farm race can also 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.330
 serve to disorient the enemy and 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.750
 give you a chance to make a 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.750
 special 

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:49.079
 the use of trunks or techniques 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:51.089
 replacement are the most useful to me 

00:05:49.079 --> 00:05:53.969
 seem since they can be saved in the 

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:56.429
 the most critical moment of a battle the 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:58.110
 way to make different points also 

00:05:56.429 --> 00:06:00.149
 They vary depending on where you are 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.139
 pointing for example now when 

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:03.139
 I point in another position 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:09.319
 one of the two techniques that consume 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.210
 chakra is from the wood which I use it 

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:13.639
 very often since I like to keep the 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.680
 chakra until the end of the battle but 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:17.960
 this time I do not use to see the 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.270
 naruto awakening which will be activated 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.699
 once you have the chakra to the top another 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.949
 technique that I do not know what to call it is this 

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:27.169
 it's like a kind of amaterasu that 

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:29.659
 it covers susana but it does not always come out 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:31.879
 since it lasts about 3 or 4 seconds 

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:33.979
 something remarkable about the characters of 

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:36.409
 reinforcement is that you can also use them 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:39.590
 as a barrier but at a big cost like 

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:41.539
 the one who just suffered naruto another use 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.610
 very useful that they can give to the shield of 

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:47.050
 the wood they are is to block races 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:50.110
 of chagra with adults flying 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:52.539
 as you can see after almost 7 minutes 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:54.460
 naruto deigns to use the awakening this 

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:57.690
 transformation is achieved when your life 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.690
 is in critical condition 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.800
 [Music] 

00:06:59.409 --> 00:07:03.080
 i 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.150
 to beat the four-play song 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.009
 I will use the technique that consumes the most 

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:10.030
 chakra soars that so I do not know very well 

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:10.030
 if you do not see the funk 

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.840
 [Music] 

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:26.079

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:26.079
 [Music] 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.300
 Nice 

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.629
 [Music] 

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:40.759
 good people it's time to conclude 

00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:42.740
 with the video but before I want to tell you
