of feces right there at the back door or
the<00:01:16.610> anus<00:01:16.820> and<00:01:17.090> so<00:01:17.270> you<00:01:17.330> want<00:01:17.570> to<00:01:17.660> kind<00:01:17.810> of<00:01:17.930> try

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
the anus and so you want to kind of try

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.100 
the anus and so you want to kind of try
to<00:01:18.200> get<00:01:18.410> around<00:01:18.560> that<00:01:19.010> because<00:01:19.700> the<00:01:20.210> feces<00:01:20.960> is

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
to get around that because the feces is

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.200 
to get around that because the feces is
usually<00:01:21.410> a<00:01:21.440> couple<00:01:21.770> degrees<00:01:22.040> lower<00:01:22.940> than

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
usually a couple degrees lower than

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.840 
usually a couple degrees lower than
their<00:01:23.360> normal<00:01:23.540> body<00:01:23.930> temperature<00:01:24.050> I<00:01:24.790> mean<00:01:25.790> you

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
their normal body temperature I mean you

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.730 
their normal body temperature I mean you
want<00:01:26.030> to<00:01:26.090> be<00:01:26.150> accurate<00:01:26.540> about<00:01:26.660> that<00:01:26.780> so<00:01:27.530> if<00:01:27.650> you

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
want to be accurate about that so if you

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.350 
want to be accurate about that so if you
call<00:01:27.890> the<00:01:28.100> bed<00:01:28.250> in<00:01:28.430> the<00:01:28.520> middle<00:01:28.610> of<00:01:28.820> the<00:01:28.910> night

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
call the bed in the middle of the night

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.270 
call the bed in the middle of the night
it<00:01:29.540> sure<00:01:29.870> is<00:01:30.050> helpful<00:01:30.500> to<00:01:30.530> have<00:01:30.620> a<00:01:30.830> temperature

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
it sure is helpful to have a temperature

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.580 
it sure is helpful to have a temperature
to<00:01:32.150> tell<00:01:32.360> them<00:01:32.570> so<00:01:32.810> that<00:01:32.960> they<00:01:33.110> know<00:01:33.260> what<00:01:33.470> to

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
to tell them so that they know what to

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.250 
to tell them so that they know what to
do<00:01:33.740> and<00:01:34.010> if<00:01:34.730> they<00:01:34.910> should<00:01:34.970> come<00:01:35.120> in<00:01:35.510> in<00:01:36.170> the

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
do and if they should come in in the

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.870 
do and if they should come in in the
middle<00:01:36.470> of<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:36.650> night<00:01:36.860> or<00:01:37.070> if<00:01:37.460> you<00:01:37.550> can<00:01:37.700> wait

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
middle of the night or if you can wait

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.500 
middle of the night or if you can wait
and<00:01:38.030> save<00:01:38.270> some<00:01:38.420> money<00:01:38.600> then<00:01:38.840> next<00:01:39.170> morning<00:01:42.010> so

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
and save some money then next morning so

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.430 
and save some money then next morning so
we've<00:01:44.510> ruled<00:01:44.720> out<00:01:44.930> cancer<00:01:47.020> we<00:01:48.020> haven't<00:01:48.320> ruled

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
we've ruled out cancer we haven't ruled

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.030 
we've ruled out cancer we haven't ruled
out<00:01:48.680> infection<00:01:49.630> we<00:01:50.630> fix<00:01:50.900> the<00:01:51.020> subluxation

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
out infection we fix the subluxation

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.480 
out infection we fix the subluxation
maybe<00:01:52.400> that's<00:01:52.760> all<00:01:53.120> there<00:01:53.360> is<00:01:53.390> to<00:01:53.780> it<00:01:53.900> but<00:01:54.490> if

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
maybe that's all there is to it but if

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.250 
maybe that's all there is to it but if
that's<00:01:55.820> the<00:01:56.030> case<00:01:56.150> then<00:01:56.690> you're<00:01:56.840> gonna<00:01:56.960> have
