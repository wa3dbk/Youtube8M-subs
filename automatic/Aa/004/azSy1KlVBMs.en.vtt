 if the sugar mass the right one 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.420
 consistency and temperature is can you 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.159
 in two ways determine if you the

 mass in cold water drops that

 It should be after eight to ten seconds 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.950
 has his if you only thermometer 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.729
 the mass must have a temperature of 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.140
 Reach 150 degrees

 in that the april before the 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.980
 caramelize cold ground is the train 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:12.130
