00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.280
 how it will look like 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.969
 people will take part in the project 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:08.309
 if he is chaos 

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:09.490
 implementation 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.650
 same project all this of course should 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.260
 be written 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.349
 are proposed 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.349
 your assistance questions 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.159
 regulations 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:25.269
 number 3 if he refused you mean 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.790
 wrong dad russia taking with 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.849

 don't write another letter based 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:35.199
 analysis of these errors that we already 

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:36.729
 launched 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:38.680
 rule number 4 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.150
 the state has their children a lot but they 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.920
 already distributed and every year in September 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.069
 the budget is being formed and therefore what 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.340
 the sooner you ask for help the more 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.720
 the likelihood that you use 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.990
 in the top ten options here I am 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.409
 in native 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:58.549
 from the state 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:00.379
 there is finance but some 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:02.839
 government employees consider them 

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:05.209
 your breather party so 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.209
 called rollback 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.059
 so it was clear there is no law if you suddenly 

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:14.689
 to meet such a man in his 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:16.340
 the way it is not thinking 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.090
 to make decisions 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.559
 because it plays youth 

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:23.900
 the crime 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.440
 all this can help you but only in 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.440
 one case if you have each 

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:31.309
 and figure it out 

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:34.019
 in not saying it is also important to give 

00:04:34.019 --> 00:04:36.669
 correct assessment of the park in your city 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:37.800
 because if you 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.050
 ten people periodically and 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.680
 conquerors of the city 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.509
 enterprises 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:45.759
 the expenditure part further every hour someone from 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:48.809
 you are respected by the Kiev ambulance 

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:51.330
 do not ask for resignation 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.449
 because so much money 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:55.770
 so the price is alcohol promotion 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.030
 I suggest everyone to do hello as we 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.060

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.099
 stand out 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:04.520
 stop smoking 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.830

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:10.689
 serviceman
