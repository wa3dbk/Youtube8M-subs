attack us well apparently the Muslims
attack<00:03:41.770> the<00:03:41.950> US<00:03:42.130> because<00:03:42.930> they<00:03:43.930> believe<00:03:44.890> that

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
attack the US because they believe that

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.160 
attack the US because they believe that

if they did that by if they attacked us

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.810 
if they did that by if they attacked us
then<00:03:47.739> they<00:03:47.890> would<00:03:48.040> go<00:03:48.070> straight<00:03:48.220> to<00:03:48.640> heaven

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
then they would go straight to heaven

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.060 
then they would go straight to heaven
because<00:03:49.600> they<00:03:49.870> believe<00:03:50.170> in<00:03:50.290> Allah<00:03:50.530> which<00:03:50.890> is

based<00:04:02.560> on<00:04:02.739> your<00:04:02.860> religion<00:04:03.250> pretty<00:04:03.430> much<00:04:03.610> but

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
based on your religion pretty much but

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.050 
based on your religion pretty much but
since<00:04:04.120> the<00:04:04.239> US<00:04:04.750> is<00:04:04.959> like<00:04:05.110> a<00:04:05.280> Christian<00:04:06.280> more<00:04:06.940> of

a Christian Catholic thumb country

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.420 
a Christian Catholic thumb country
that's<00:04:11.230> why<00:04:11.440> they<00:04:11.620> they<00:04:11.890> were<00:04:11.950> like<00:04:12.190> jealous
