00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 but 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:29.580
 Steering blood calmly straight to the branch 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:32.029
 landed a ticket before martin no no 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.029
 to make 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:57.390
 eight no we're not doing i'm doing 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:01:03.470
 okay this is good all orders were on 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.470
 and God always hurts this root 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:15.090
 okay big came okay then 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.450
 I 'll show you how to avoid it. 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.580
 Hello and this video is dedicated to 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.020
 as 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.060
 is dedicated to just skating techniques 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.090
 rough terrain well actually 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.240
 a fragment of how wrong you saw 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:35.710
 before that all that consequences too 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:40.330
 each had its own car 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.470
 yeah well first not to fall for now 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:47.180
 such a crossed path 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:50.300
 need to know no few rules 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.980
 first you don't need a bike attached 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.760
 as if you are afraid of falling 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.290
 on the contrary it will cause you to fall 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.800
 need to feel on the bike 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:04.340
 absolutely calm to take away steering 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.090
 this part could easily reach you 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.619
 download 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.399
 to others or less often to frost so that you can 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.720
 backwards 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.230
 I got to the bed and almost hit one place 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.530
 wheel 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.910
 that is, walk as much as possible 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.890
 diligent as well then you won't fall 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.600
 try to keep your head in one and 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.459
 same position relative to the bike 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.489
 that is, as if the bike is not under you 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:34.190
 I would walk the kidney on the roots of the beginning of the Second World War 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.489
 try to keep your head 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.560
 fixed position 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.620
 if you have a two -suspension 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.680
 on this 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.150
 such peresechenke building suspension I 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.989
 mix already convinced in practice 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.420
 go and strongly I have it here for this 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:57.940
 period of which visit is the very beginning 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:00.769
 she went about 2 3 millimeters all 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.690
 the front fork went half way down 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:06.670
 there is 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:11.440
 the main thing is to distribute the load try 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.330
 move the load on the rear wheel with 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.060
 finish this 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:18.960
 secondly , look hard at the road 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:22.330
 that is, if you see a kidney 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.990
 pit root or something else right away 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.320
 get ready 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:30.130
 relax your hands and get ready to 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.860
 they went ahead on you and watched tara not 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.920
 you can 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.050
 give legs well legs too 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.620
 relax 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.760
 you could quickly sit down or stand up and 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.700
 give 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.310
 remember the roots are slippery so whatever 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.250
 you have not had a max for a dollar or else 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.280
 Anything cool there I 'll listen to listen 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.049
 will still tell on the roots 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.180
 so always remember this and not 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:00.579
 gazuy tina roots because it can 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.480
 do you have a lot of fun mix 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:07.060
 will fall out what happened to me them 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.510
 together also not to slow down or when 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.890
 do you feel you are driving to the root 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.310
 just idle 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:18.810
 try but source pedal with 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:21.430
 this figured out the role of the role is 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:25.000
 500 ohm level on such a forest is not even 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:28.060
 try and I have a 660 and a steering wheel and me 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.449
 ok if 700 then here's one 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.060
 the paper path hope to somewhere 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:37.240
 shrubs and trees branches along the edges 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.250
 dropping and it will be bad so 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.100
 need a mental bike whose steering wheel 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:45.039
 lobster 800 millimeters ride in the woods not 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.630
 worth it or put the role that now 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:50.830
 millimeter or shelling something 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.810
 put and still very important to know how 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.360
 to switch gears on such 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:59.020
 areas where switching is correct 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.849
 gears best can slow down 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.880
 you about the worst you can tear 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:07.180
 meetings and you break yourself not into the corridor 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:10.289
 or move away and teeth if you are poor you 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.289
 made us 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:17.170
 so the gears need to stop right 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.600
 if you have a good switch type 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:23.380
 as I have only glor or heard 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:25.600
 just yard and lego cx trk well about and 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:30.070
 By the way do not on the clock in any 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.570
 interrupt equally well if you 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.000
 Acer Olivia 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:37.120
 the more torusnye at all not 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.070
 climb into the woods due to the scars to the lineup i 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.080
 I donâ€™t really know what you are there 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.910
 budget 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.560
 so about them they will not grow and 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.350
 about shimano I speculate 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:50.980
 and how if you have a powerful perry type 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:52.590
 from overview and sweden above category to 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.270
 try to switch 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.280
 Well, maybe I love it with sure when you 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.710
 pedal quietly but try 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.260
 don't do that, that is, look in 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:05.880
 clicked on the transfer risk coins 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:08.190
 let's say where the switch 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:12.930
 hello when you press and give neither 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:16.350
 cool as soon as the coin sat down a little bit 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.920
 spin the pedals when ancestors or creatures 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:19.350
 this passivka 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:22.440
 through the pedals you can calmly continue 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:25.200
 cool if you have a dollar xd like mine 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:28.590
 don't worry about it just switch 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.630
 like how to stand in front of rations uchachi more 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:35.570
 more 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:39.120
 if your goal is sand rubles then 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:40.850
 switch very shore because her 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:44.310
 break just epicgear 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:48.030
 Gregory already two days broke 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:53.490
 area well, and if you have a strong chain 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:56.220
 all right well this 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:07:00.530
 I will now try the same plot 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:04.430
 drive like 1 right without falling and 

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:07.430
 everything will be recorded on camera so 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.430
 let's get started 

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:50.090
 so like this 

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:53.640
 saw how I went there of course it is not 

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:56.670
 such roots on which can be hellishly 

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:58.560
 fall well did you see i managed to procure 

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:59.510
 so I think this video will be you 

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:03.600
 is useful 

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:06.090
 we also want to divide you last 

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:09.570
 wish not to fall in the forest and not at all 

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:11.450
 get to go fine and thank you all 

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:14.450
 for watching all bye 

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:14.450
 a drop
