00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
so this is just a quick video of my fish

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.120 
so this is just a quick video of my fish
tank<00:00:05.160> it's<00:00:05.819> only<00:00:06.029> a<00:00:06.150> three<00:00:06.359> foot<00:00:06.600> /<00:00:06.839> 15<00:00:07.290> it's

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
tank it's only a three foot / 15 it's

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.390 
tank it's only a three foot / 15 it's
when<00:00:08.340> a<00:00:09.139> bomber<00:00:10.139> in<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.349> cutter<00:00:10.769> parade<00:00:11.099> yawns

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
when a bomber in the cutter parade yawns

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.169 
when a bomber in the cutter parade yawns
on<00:00:11.610> it<00:00:11.759> which<00:00:12.450> is<00:00:13.049> probably<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.910> best<00:00:14.910> thing

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
on it which is probably the best thing

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.189 
on it which is probably the best thing
I've<00:00:15.299> got<00:00:15.480> on<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.660> sound

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
I've got on the sound

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.450 
I've got on the sound
screamer<00:00:16.980> in<00:00:17.100> about<00:00:17.310> four<00:00:17.640> months<00:00:17.850> now<00:00:18.350> a<00:00:19.460> lot

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
screamer in about four months now a lot

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.700 
screamer in about four months now a lot
of<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.670> stuff<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:21.150> out<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.330> my<00:00:21.570> old<00:00:21.720> tank<00:00:22.020> I

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
of the stuff is out of my old tank I

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.519 
of the stuff is out of my old tank I
went<00:00:23.250> for<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.430> song<00:00:23.640> system<00:00:24.060> this<00:00:24.210> time<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.960> to

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
went for a song system this time and to

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.040 
went for a song system this time and to
be<00:00:25.619> honest<00:00:25.859> it's<00:00:26.490> doing<00:00:26.939> really<00:00:27.090> well<00:00:27.359> I've

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
be honest it's doing really well I've

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.320 
be honest it's doing really well I've
got<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.320> miracle<00:00:28.529> mode<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.429> basic<00:00:29.880> skimmer

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
got the miracle mode and a basic skimmer

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.440 
got the miracle mode and a basic skimmer
just<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.080> prism<00:00:31.500> just<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.550> help<00:00:32.790> help<00:00:33.270> with<00:00:33.390> the

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
just a prism just to help help with the

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.150 
just a prism just to help help with the
filtration<00:00:33.899> also<00:00:34.829> on<00:00:35.040> our<00:00:35.250> zone<00:00:36.649> so<00:00:37.649> that

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
filtration also on our zone so that

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.450 
filtration also on our zone so that
might<00:00:38.370> help<00:00:38.660> well<00:00:39.739> as<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.860> can<00:00:40.980> see<00:00:41.160> if<00:00:41.219> it's

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
might help well as you can see if it's

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.100 
might help well as you can see if it's
do<00:00:41.640> really<00:00:41.879> well<00:00:42.120> these<00:00:42.390> are<00:00:42.570> growing<00:00:42.840> like

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
do really well these are growing like

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.190 
do really well these are growing like
mad<00:00:43.640> the<00:00:44.640> light<00:00:44.850> spectrum<00:00:45.149> got<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:45.840> on<00:00:45.960> on<00:00:46.079> the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
mad the light spectrum got it on on the

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.350 
mad the light spectrum got it on on the
radians<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.860> 10k<00:00:48.110> no<00:00:49.110> 12<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:49.710> 12<00:00:49.980> K<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:51.210> I'm

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
radians is 10k no 12 so 12 K and I'm

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.010 
radians is 10k no 12 so 12 K and I'm
running<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:52.399> on<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.670> natural<00:00:54.059> cycle<00:00:54.570> for

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
running it on the natural cycle for

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.790 
running it on the natural cycle for
about<00:00:55.170> 8<00:00:55.350> hours<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.710> day

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.709 

things<00:00:59.489> do<00:00:59.699> seem<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.000> be<00:01:00.120> growing<00:01:00.329> not<00:01:00.629> as

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
things do seem to be growing not as

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.420 
things do seem to be growing not as
quick<00:01:00.930> as<00:01:01.079> if<00:01:01.230> if<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.829> was<00:01:01.920> running<00:01:02.039> on<00:01:02.280> an

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
quick as if if I was running on an

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.640 
quick as if if I was running on an
artificial<00:01:02.879> mobile<00:01:03.510> they've<00:01:04.199> been<00:01:04.409> doing

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
artificial mobile they've been doing

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.050 
artificial mobile they've been doing
really<00:01:04.860> well<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.100> mean<00:01:05.309> with<00:01:05.460> entra<00:01:05.760> philia

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
really well I mean with entra philia

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.510 
really well I mean with entra philia
that's<00:01:06.630> team<00:01:06.990> doing<00:01:07.770> great

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
that's team doing great

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.100 
that's team doing great
it's<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.119> ting<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.360> light<00:01:09.570> as<00:01:09.810> well<00:01:09.990> as

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
it's a ting the light as well as

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.000 
it's a ting the light as well as
nighttime<00:01:11.180> it<00:01:12.180> does<00:01:12.420> just<00:01:12.990> shrivel<00:01:13.290> up<00:01:13.350> mainly

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
nighttime it does just shrivel up mainly

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.840 
nighttime it does just shrivel up mainly
during<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.400> day<00:01:14.840> because<00:01:16.280> it<00:01:17.280> doesn't<00:01:17.729> need

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
during the day because it doesn't need

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.580 
during the day because it doesn't need
to<00:01:18.350> to<00:01:20.479> photosynthesize<00:01:21.479> during<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.960> day<00:01:22.140> it

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
to to photosynthesize during the day it

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.550 
to to photosynthesize during the day it
just<00:01:22.650> fades<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.780> so<00:01:24.780> I've<00:01:24.930> been<00:01:24.990> told

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
just fades and so I've been told

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.719 
just fades and so I've been told
and<00:01:26.130> probably<00:01:26.520> correct<00:01:26.820> me<00:01:26.880> if<00:01:27.060> I'm<00:01:27.210> wrong<00:01:27.240> but

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
and probably correct me if I'm wrong but

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:30.679 
and probably correct me if I'm wrong but

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
everything just seems to be doing really

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:31.219 
everything just seems to be doing really
well

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
well

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:41.370 
well
hammerheads<00:01:32.070> are<00:01:32.189> growing

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:49.930

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
to get a lot of freights I really really

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.310 
to get a lot of freights I really really
let<00:02:02.870> the<00:02:03.380> whole<00:02:03.560> thing<00:02:03.590> grow<00:02:04.450> but<00:02:05.450> there's<00:02:06.260> a

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
let the whole thing grow but there's a
