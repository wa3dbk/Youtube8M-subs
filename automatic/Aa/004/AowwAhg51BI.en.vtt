00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.660
 accompany us gospel pearls 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:09.929
 with trades haroldo hello everybody 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.860
 welcome to another pearls program 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.040
 gospel 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.250
 today we are going to study how 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.810
 when the books were written that 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:24.750
 make up the collection called the good bible 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.029
 these books most likely because 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.420
 there is no absolute consensus on this 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.850
 theme began to be recorded about 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.600
 one thousand years before Christ 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.500
 in the reign of David and Solomon a little 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.340
 before 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.460
 remember that these books deal with the 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.719
 history of the Hebrew people and the history of 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.329
 relationship of these people with their faith 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:54.030
 monotheist or faith in the only god 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.820
 it would be a mistake to imagine that 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.890
 these books followed the same process of 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.879
 production than a current book than a book 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.629
 modern 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.640
 on the contrary at that time it was very 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.340
 difficult to write a book 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.830
 for several reasons, the first of these is the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.070
 difficulty in obtaining material in the 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.970
 case papyrus and parchment that the skin of 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.110
 an animal 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.900
 according to the difficulty in producing 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.140
 inks to be able to write etc. 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.850
 perhaps the greatest difficulty is 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.670
 writing ability 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.119
 because if you racy a letter or 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.759
 stained and did not use an entire sheet 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.490
 of paper and the other of parchment and that 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.680
 represented a very high cost 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.100
 we had at that time a 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:49.710
 the profession of the persons who 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:53.149
 wrote the so-called scribes of 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.649
 so that society would prefer 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:59.579
 convey your stories 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.730
 their traditions by counting 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.540
 orality 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:08.380
 they were telling stories going from father 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:12.130
 for grandfather's son to grandson that these 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:15.820
 traditions perpetuated the people in the 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:19.060
 schools in homes in 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:23.530
 prayer and study the stories were 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:25.530
 counted and retold and people like 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.480
 had a habit of hearing stories 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.820
 were prepared to record these 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.780
 stories naturally had a memory 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:38.440
 much more trained a very memory 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.990
 superior to our memory that favored 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.830
 with which people recorded these 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.300
 stories 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:48.640
 another factor is the exhaustive repetition of these 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.050
 stories also encourage the 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:56.110
 people to decorate and how they were 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:58.600
 forced or encouraged to transmit 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.670
 these stories from your children to the 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.680
 family children did not end up 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.220
 recording and these stories were 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.770
 stored in popular culture what we 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.400
 we can technically call folklore 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:14.500
 popular only over time after 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.820
 many centuries 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:22.090
 these stories were being collected and 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:25.570
 annotated on papyrus and scrolls 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:30.030
 even so they were not complete annotations 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:33.580
 were summarized notes with time 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:36.780
 scribes doctors of the law priests 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.520
 began to hone these notes 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:43.980
 make some corrections 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:47.380
 some embellishments destination improvements 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:51.690
 harmonization of vocabulary harmonization 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:55.360
 of parts and with time were born 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:58.090
 little by little these books that we 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.910
 we know today that it is the books that 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.130
 make up the bible they were not born of 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:06.700
 at a time they were growing 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:10.200
 over time until they take the form 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.200
 that we know today
