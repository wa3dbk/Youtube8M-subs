00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:33.670 

it's<00:01:22.350> just<00:01:22.590> kind<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:22.920> like<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.070> guide

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.679

take the next two outside ones again and

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.220 
take the next two outside ones again and
now<00:02:37.900> we<00:02:37.959> have<00:02:38.230> three<00:02:38.680> going<00:02:38.980> that<00:02:39.340> way<00:02:40.110> and<00:02:41.110> now

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
now we have three going that way and now

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.460 
now we have three going that way and now
we<00:02:41.290> got<00:02:41.530> to<00:02:41.560> do<00:02:41.709> the<00:02:41.860> other<00:02:42.989> side

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
we got to do the other side

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.339 
we got to do the other side
so<00:02:44.890> we're<00:02:45.040> going<00:02:45.160> to<00:02:45.250> take<00:02:45.540> since<00:02:46.540> these<00:02:47.019> two

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
so we're going to take since these two

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:48.660 
so we're going to take since these two
are<00:02:47.380> on<00:02:47.560> top<00:02:47.830> we're<00:02:48.099> going<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.280> take<00:02:48.489> this

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
are on top we're going to take this

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:58.800 
are on top we're going to take this
middle<00:02:49.060> one<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:54.610> put<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.209> next<00:02:55.569> one<00:02:57.569> lay<00:02:58.569> that

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
middle one and put the next one lay that

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.070 
middle one and put the next one lay that
one<00:02:58.870> down<00:02:59.260> take<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.160> two<00:03:00.430> outside<00:03:01.030> ones<00:03:01.080> pull

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:10.979 
one down take the two outside ones pull
that<00:03:02.260> back<00:03:04.950> lay<00:03:05.950> that<00:03:06.220> one<00:03:06.459> down<00:03:09.630> and<00:03:10.630> I<00:03:10.930> think

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
that back lay that one down and I think

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:18.240 
that back lay that one down and I think
I<00:03:11.230> got<00:03:11.380> room<00:03:11.560> for<00:03:11.590> one<00:03:11.890> more<00:03:12.130> little<00:03:12.850> one<00:03:17.250> and

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:34.420 
are covered so I pull back this one and
this<00:03:26.440> one<00:03:29.670> put<00:03:30.670> that<00:03:30.940> one

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.880 

and<00:03:34.909> the<00:03:35.480> two<00:03:35.750> that<00:03:35.900> are<00:03:35.959> covered<00:03:36.349> again<00:03:36.709> we're

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
and the two that are covered again we're

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:43.780 
and the two that are covered again we're
going<00:03:36.980> to<00:03:37.040> pull<00:03:37.280> back<00:03:37.489> that<00:03:37.760> one<00:03:38.030> I<00:03:42.579> think<00:03:43.579> that

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
going to pull back that one I think that

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.899 
going to pull back that one I think that
will<00:03:44.000> be<00:03:44.150> my<00:03:44.299> last<00:03:44.569> one

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:45.909 
will be my last one

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:52.590 
will be my last one
put<00:03:46.909> them<00:03:47.150> back

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.830 

and<00:03:53.600> now<00:03:53.930> you<00:03:53.990> just<00:03:54.700> make<00:03:55.700> sure<00:03:56.000> you<00:03:56.120> seal

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
and now you just make sure you seal

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.130 
and now you just make sure you seal
these<00:03:57.080> down<00:03:57.380> because<00:03:57.740> they<00:03:57.920> will<00:03:58.190> shrink<00:03:59.140> so

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
these down because they will shrink so

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:09.119 
these down because they will shrink so
you<00:04:00.260> want<00:04:00.470> them<00:04:00.560> to<00:04:00.650> stay<00:04:01.250> in<00:04:01.310> place

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:09.129 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:13.690 

and<00:04:10.129> then<00:04:10.340> just<00:04:10.610> put<00:04:10.909> your<00:04:11.680> traditional<00:04:12.700> edge

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
and then just put your traditional edge

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.240 
and then just put your traditional edge
just<00:04:14.269> make<00:04:14.480> sure<00:04:14.750> you<00:04:14.980> seal<00:04:15.980> that<00:04:16.010> down<00:04:18.250> you

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
just make sure you seal that down you

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.920 
just make sure you seal that down you
could<00:04:19.400> take<00:04:19.579> a<00:04:19.609> fork<00:04:20.030> you<00:04:20.239> could<00:04:20.540> use<00:04:20.720> your

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
could take a fork you could use your

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.629 
could take a fork you could use your
fingers<00:04:21.109> and<00:04:21.650> do<00:04:21.739> the<00:04:22.120> pinch<00:04:23.949> but<00:04:24.949> that's<00:04:25.340> how

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
fingers and do the pinch but that's how

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.860 
fingers and do the pinch but that's how
you<00:04:25.669> make<00:04:26.270> a<00:04:26.479> lattice<00:04:26.990> top<00:04:27.440> pike
