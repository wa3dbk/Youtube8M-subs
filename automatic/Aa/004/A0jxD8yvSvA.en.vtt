right<00:00:02.070> so<00:00:02.340> this<00:00:02.460> video<00:00:02.790> is<00:00:02.850> going<00:00:03.120> to<00:00:03.179> show

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:03.650 
right so this video is going to show

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.170 
right so this video is going to show
problems<00:00:04.650> that<00:00:04.890> people<00:00:05.339> sometimes<00:00:05.640> come

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
problems that people sometimes come

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.520 
problems that people sometimes come
across<00:00:06.210> if<00:00:07.049> they<00:00:08.150> overuse<00:00:09.150> or<00:00:09.510> over<00:00:09.960> discharge

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
across if they overuse or over discharge

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.940 
across if they overuse or over discharge
a<00:00:10.980> lipo<00:00:11.550> battery<00:00:11.969> so<00:00:12.719> we've<00:00:12.900> got<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.049> basic<00:00:13.349> lipo

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
a lipo battery so we've got a basic lipo

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.859 
a lipo battery so we've got a basic lipo
battery<00:00:14.370> here<00:00:14.990> that<00:00:15.990> we've<00:00:16.230> been<00:00:16.619> using

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
battery here that we've been using

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.460 
battery here that we've been using
carelessly<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.199> it's<00:00:20.010> now<00:00:20.750> low-voltage<00:00:21.750> on<00:00:22.199> a

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
carelessly and it's now low-voltage on a

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.740 
carelessly and it's now low-voltage on a
couple<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.100> it<00:00:23.250> on<00:00:23.400> all<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.000> cells<00:00:24.470> okay<00:00:25.470> so

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
couple of it on all of the cells okay so

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.990 
couple of it on all of the cells okay so
as<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:27.930> would<00:00:28.050> normally<00:00:28.199> do<00:00:28.619> when<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:29.730> try

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
as you would normally do when you try

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.659 
as you would normally do when you try
and<00:00:30.060> plug<00:00:30.359> this<00:00:30.599> in<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.140> your<00:00:31.560> lipo<00:00:32.189> balance

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
and plug this in to your lipo balance

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.459 
and plug this in to your lipo balance
charger<00:00:33.559> in<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.860> standard<00:00:35.280> way<00:00:35.870> you<00:00:36.870> set<00:00:37.320> it

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
charger in the standard way you set it

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.440 
charger in the standard way you set it
up<00:00:37.530> for<00:00:37.590> lipo<00:00:39.260> I've<00:00:40.260> got<00:00:40.469> one<00:00:40.649> preset<00:00:41.219> here<00:00:41.550> to

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
up for lipo I've got one preset here to

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.150 
up for lipo I've got one preset here to
charge<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.870> three<00:00:43.079> cell<00:00:43.320> lipo<00:00:43.559> at

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
charge a three cell lipo at

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.750 
charge a three cell lipo at
two-and-a-half<00:00:44.520> amps<00:00:45.090> click<00:00:45.899> start<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.829> it

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
two-and-a-half amps click start and it

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.220 
two-and-a-half amps click start and it
immediately<00:00:47.969> gives<00:00:48.360> us<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.570> cells<00:00:48.840> over<00:00:51.050> okay

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
immediately gives us a cells over okay

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.279 
immediately gives us a cells over okay
so<00:00:52.980> we<00:00:53.160> can't<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.850> we<00:00:54.180> can't<00:00:54.449> charge<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:55.140> in

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
so we can't you we can't charge it in

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.270 
so we can't you we can't charge it in
normal<00:00:56.250> low<00:00:56.730> PO<00:00:56.969> balance<00:00:57.360> mode<00:00:57.770> so<00:00:58.770> what<00:00:58.920> we<00:00:59.039> do

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
normal low PO balance mode so what we do

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.080 
normal low PO balance mode so what we do
is<00:00:59.640> we<00:01:00.390> change<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.840> type<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.949> battery<00:01:02.399> to

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
is we change the type of the battery to

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.160 
is we change the type of the battery to
now<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.589> nickel<00:01:04.589> metal<00:01:04.710> hydride<00:01:04.890> mode<00:01:05.630> and<00:01:06.630> set

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
now a nickel metal hydride mode and set

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.620 
now a nickel metal hydride mode and set
the<00:01:07.260> number<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.619> cells<00:01:07.950> such<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:09.030> final

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
the number of cells such that the final

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.719 
the number of cells such that the final
voltage<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:12.049> just<00:01:13.049> over<00:01:14.119> three<00:01:15.119> point<00:01:15.479> two

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
voltage is just over three point two

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.490 
voltage is just over three point two
times<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:18.000> number<00:01:18.030> cells<00:01:18.540> so<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.470> a

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
times the number cells so this is a

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.520 
times the number cells so this is a
3-cell<00:01:20.159> battery<00:01:20.509> so<00:01:21.509> we<00:01:21.750> need<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.200> get<00:01:22.350> each

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
3-cell battery so we need to get each

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.219 
3-cell battery so we need to get each
cell<00:01:22.920> up<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.310> at<00:01:23.430> least<00:01:23.610> three<00:01:24.210> volts<00:01:24.600> per<00:01:24.840> cell

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
cell up to at least three volts per cell

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.890 
cell up to at least three volts per cell
we<00:01:25.590> ideally<00:01:26.159> like<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.490> have<00:01:26.670> three<00:01:27.420> point<00:01:27.689> two

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
we ideally like to have three point two

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.620 
we ideally like to have three point two
volts<00:01:27.930> per<00:01:28.530> cell<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.820> if<00:01:29.909> we<00:01:30.030> just<00:01:30.240> take<00:01:30.450> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
volts per cell so if we just take the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.020 
volts per cell so if we just take the
number<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.990> cells<00:01:31.409> up<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.610> we<00:01:32.700> get<00:01:32.880> you

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
number of cells up so that we get you

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:41.240 
number of cells up so that we get you
know<00:01:33.060> 12<00:01:33.570> or<00:01:33.960> 12<00:01:34.350> point<00:01:34.590> 6<00:01:34.920> volts<00:01:35.840> final<00:01:40.250> so

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
know 12 or 12 point 6 volts final so

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.130 
know 12 or 12 point 6 volts final so
this<00:01:41.430> one<00:01:41.610> gives<00:01:41.759> us<00:01:41.970> an<00:01:42.060> option<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.420> 12<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:42.899> say

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
this one gives us an option of 12 so say

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.240 
this one gives us an option of 12 so say
12<00:01:43.439> volts<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.670> should<00:01:44.880> do<00:01:45.030> fine<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:46.250> just

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
12 volts that should do fine and just

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.429 
12 volts that should do fine and just
say<00:01:47.369> start<00:01:47.880> it's<00:01:48.780> going<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.079> give<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.350> an

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
say start it's going to give you an

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.660 
say start it's going to give you an
error<00:01:49.619> because<00:01:49.950> we've<00:01:50.250> still<00:01:50.460> got<00:01:50.579> the

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
error because we've still got the

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.300 
error because we've still got the
balance<00:01:50.909> lead<00:01:51.329> connected<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.200> just<00:01:53.040> take<00:01:53.220> the

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
balance lead connected so just take the

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.880 
balance lead connected so just take the
balance<00:01:53.460> leader<00:01:53.820> out<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.500> now<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.619> will<00:01:55.740> let

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
balance leader out and now it will let

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.069 
balance leader out and now it will let
you<00:01:56.009> charge<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:57.299> it's<00:01:57.420> just<00:01:57.600> going<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.840> charge

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
you charge so it's just going to charge

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.780 
you charge so it's just going to charge
you<00:01:58.200> through<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.439> main<00:01:58.619> dish<00:01:58.829> discharge<00:01:59.549> lead

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
you through the main dish discharge lead

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.050 
you through the main dish discharge lead
instead<00:02:00.590> not<00:02:01.590> advisory<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.219> do<00:02:02.369> this<00:02:02.579> for<00:02:02.880> very

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
set these cells in the battery so we'll

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.840 
set these cells in the battery so we'll
cover<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.800> battery<00:02:29.100> back<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.400> normal

cover the battery back to normal
won't<00:02:30.780> be<00:02:30.960> perfect<00:02:31.230> if<00:02:31.620> you<00:02:31.710> do<00:02:31.830> this<00:02:31.980> too<00:02:32.220> many

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
won't be perfect if you do this too many

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.390 
won't be perfect if you do this too many

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
times you do end up wrecking the battery

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.010 
times you do end up wrecking the battery
but<00:02:35.400> most<00:02:35.730> lipo<00:02:36.150> batteries<00:02:36.570> are<00:02:36.690> fairly

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
but most lipo batteries are fairly

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.220 
but most lipo batteries are fairly
resilient<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.620> they<00:02:37.710> will<00:02:37.920> survive<00:02:39.110> that<00:02:40.110> is

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
resilient and they will survive that is

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.870 
resilient and they will survive that is

I<00:02:48.420> say<00:02:48.570> these<00:02:48.780> these<00:02:49.760> any<00:02:50.760> old<00:02:50.970> lipo<00:02:51.390> batteries

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
I say these these any old lipo batteries

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.690 
I say these these any old lipo batteries
are<00:02:51.960> fine<00:02:52.110> I've<00:02:52.260> just<00:02:52.410> got<00:02:52.560> a<00:02:52.590> very<00:02:52.740> old<00:02:53.010> tired

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
are fine I've just got a very old tired

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.190 
are fine I've just got a very old tired
knackered<00:02:54.330> battery<00:02:54.600> here<00:02:54.780> that<00:02:54.930> under

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
knackered battery here that under

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.770 
knackered battery here that under
decided<00:02:55.800> be<00:02:55.890> used<00:02:56.100> for<00:02:56.250> this<00:02:56.340> demo<00:02:56.750> right<00:02:57.750> a

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
decided be used for this demo right a

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.140 
decided be used for this demo right a
few<00:02:58.020> customers<00:02:58.470> that<00:02:58.620> have<00:02:58.790> pulled<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.940> cell

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
few customers that have pulled a cell

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.410 
few customers that have pulled a cell
down<00:03:00.420> too<00:03:00.750> much<00:03:00.960> on<00:03:01.220> they<00:03:02.220> lipo<00:03:02.640> battery<00:03:03.120> so<00:03:03.180> I

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
down too much on they lipo battery so I

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.580 
down too much on they lipo battery so I
thought<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.690> worthwhile<00:03:03.900> just<00:03:04.320> quickly

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
thought the worthwhile just quickly

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.200 
thought the worthwhile just quickly
doing<00:03:04.830> a<00:03:04.980> little<00:03:05.190> video<00:03:05.340> like<00:03:05.670> this<00:03:05.880> to<00:03:06.030> show

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
doing a little video like this to show

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:13.330 
doing a little video like this to show
how<00:03:06.390> to<00:03:06.450> do<00:03:06.690> this<00:03:06.840> recovery<00:03:07.380> mode<00:03:07.650> over<00:03:08.220> cover

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.760 

the<00:03:14.340> idea<00:03:14.610> being<00:03:14.820> basically<00:03:15.450> that<00:03:15.810> most

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
the idea being basically that most

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
the idea being basically that most
balance<00:03:17.130> charges<00:03:18.110> want<00:03:19.110> to<00:03:19.320> try<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:20.130> recover

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
balance charges want to try and recover

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.870 
balance charges want to try and recover
a<00:03:21.180> lipo<00:03:21.930> battery<00:03:22.410> so<00:03:22.890> they<00:03:23.070> expect<00:03:23.430> a<00:03:23.520> lipo

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
a lipo battery so they expect a lipo

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.990 
a lipo battery so they expect a lipo
battery<00:03:24.390> to<00:03:24.960> have<00:03:25.170> a<00:03:25.200> minimum<00:03:25.920> a<00:03:26.100> three<00:03:26.550> volts

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
battery to have a minimum a three volts

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.440 
battery to have a minimum a three volts
per<00:03:27.450> cell<00:03:27.900> so<00:03:28.680> clearly<00:03:29.310> a<00:03:29.430> free<00:03:29.730> cell<00:03:30.000> battery

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
per cell so clearly a free cell battery

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.260 
per cell so clearly a free cell battery
it<00:03:30.570> needs<00:03:30.750> a<00:03:30.840> minimum<00:03:31.350> of<00:03:31.550> nine<00:03:32.550> volts<00:03:33.090> in

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
it needs a minimum of nine volts in

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.160 
it needs a minimum of nine volts in
there<00:03:34.170> so<00:03:34.470> there<00:03:34.890> we've<00:03:35.010> got<00:03:35.040> ten<00:03:35.340> point<00:03:35.580> three

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
there so there we've got ten point three

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.900 
there so there we've got ten point three
now<00:03:37.170> to<00:03:37.230> do<00:03:37.470> it<00:03:37.650> I<00:03:37.710> was<00:03:37.920> based<00:03:38.130> on<00:03:38.340> for<00:03:38.640> sale

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
now to do it I was based on for sale

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.540 
now to do it I was based on for sale
just<00:03:39.150> now<00:03:39.270> sorry<00:03:39.570> my<00:03:39.930> mistake<00:03:40.190> so<00:03:41.190> we<00:03:41.340> need<00:03:41.490> to

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
just now sorry my mistake so we need to

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.990 
just now sorry my mistake so we need to
get<00:03:41.670> it<00:03:41.760> up<00:03:41.910> to<00:03:41.940> at<00:03:42.150> least<00:03:42.390> ten<00:03:43.130> volts<00:03:44.130> for<00:03:44.940> a

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
get it up to at least ten volts for a

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.440 
get it up to at least ten volts for a
3-cell<00:03:45.630> battery<00:03:45.660> or<00:03:46.350> twelve<00:03:47.160> volts<00:03:47.640> for<00:03:48.209> four

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
3-cell battery or twelve volts for four

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.410 
3-cell battery or twelve volts for four
cell<00:03:48.690> battery<00:03:49.580> so<00:03:50.580> if<00:03:50.640> we<00:03:50.730> now<00:03:50.850> plug<00:03:51.060> that<00:03:51.209> in

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
cell battery so if we now plug that in

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.710 
cell battery so if we now plug that in
the<00:03:51.870> balance<00:03:52.020> lead<00:03:52.410> it<00:03:52.590> back<00:03:52.740> in<00:03:53.240> we<00:03:54.240> switch

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
the balance lead it back in we switch

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.210 
the balance lead it back in we switch
the<00:03:54.930> type<00:03:55.200> back<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:55.770> lipo<00:03:56.310> and<00:03:57.290> in<00:03:58.290> this<00:03:58.470> case<00:03:58.770> I

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
the type back to lipo and in this case I

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.960 
the type back to lipo and in this case I
can<00:03:59.700> just<00:03:59.730> go<00:04:00.000> start<00:04:01.340> and<00:04:02.340> as<00:04:02.490> long<00:04:02.670> as<00:04:02.700> it's

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
can just go start and as long as it's

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.780 
can just go start and as long as it's
got<00:04:03.209> at<00:04:03.990> least<00:04:04.050> nine<00:04:04.440> volts<00:04:05.070> in<00:04:05.220> it<00:04:05.340> in<00:04:05.459> total

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
got at least nine volts in it in total

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.570 
got at least nine volts in it in total
which<00:04:06.360> is<00:04:06.390> now<00:04:06.720> reading<00:04:07.140> at<00:04:07.260> 3.3<00:04:08.010> volts<00:04:08.370> per

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
which is now reading at 3.3 volts per

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.300 
which is now reading at 3.3 volts per
cell<00:04:08.970> and<00:04:09.240> that<00:04:09.990> will<00:04:10.080> continue<00:04:10.560> now<00:04:10.740> charging

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
cell and that will continue now charging

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.510 
cell and that will continue now charging
in<00:04:11.430> normal<00:04:11.880> lipo<00:04:12.510> balance<00:04:12.930> mode<00:04:13.170> and<00:04:13.530> pretty

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
in normal lipo balance mode and pretty

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.550 
in normal lipo balance mode and pretty
much<00:04:14.760> recover<00:04:15.240> the<00:04:15.420> battery<00:04:16.020> I'll<00:04:16.170> often<00:04:16.350> take

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
much recover the battery I'll often take

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.560 
much recover the battery I'll often take
a<00:04:16.770> lot<00:04:17.070> longer<00:04:17.340> charging<00:04:18.299> in<00:04:18.480> this<00:04:19.440> way<00:04:19.680> and

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
a lot longer charging in this way and

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.210 
a lot longer charging in this way and
after<00:04:21.570> you've<00:04:21.660> done<00:04:21.690> a<00:04:21.840> basic<00:04:22.290> recovery<00:04:23.040> a

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
after you've done a basic recovery a

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.560 
after you've done a basic recovery a
because<00:04:23.850> you're<00:04:23.970> going<00:04:24.060> to<00:04:24.120> have<00:04:24.210> to<00:04:24.360> put<00:04:24.479> the

into your battery each time you use them

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.529 
into your battery each time you use them
then<00:04:53.009> you<00:04:53.130> can<00:04:53.280> start<00:04:53.550> getting<00:04:53.850> to<00:04:53.970> a<00:04:54.000> point<00:04:54.300> on

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:54.539 
then you can start getting to a point on

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:57.200 
then you can start getting to a point on
the<00:04:54.660> timer<00:04:55.050> that<00:04:55.470> you<00:04:55.949> fly<00:04:56.310> your<00:04:56.520> time<00:04:56.789> such

the timer that you fly your time such

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.640 
the timer that you fly your time such
that<00:04:57.449> you're<00:04:57.570> always<00:04:57.750> putting<00:04:58.110> back<00:04:58.410> in

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
that you're always putting back in

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.700 
that you're always putting back in
eighty<00:04:59.460> percent<00:05:00.180> of<00:05:00.449> the<00:05:00.720> total<00:05:01.169> capacity<00:05:01.680> of

eighty percent of the total capacity of
the<00:05:01.800> battery<00:05:02.220> so<00:05:02.910> a<00:05:02.940> 1.3<00:05:03.600> battery

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
the battery so a 1.3 battery

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.330 
the battery so a 1.3 battery
that's<00:05:05.180> 1,300<00:05:06.180> milliamps<00:05:06.780> so<00:05:06.990> we<00:05:07.710> expect<00:05:08.130> to

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
that's 1,300 milliamps so we expect to

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.990 
that's 1,300 milliamps so we expect to
put<00:05:08.550> back<00:05:08.760> into<00:05:08.789> this<00:05:09.360> on<00:05:09.600> a<00:05:09.630> full<00:05:09.870> charge

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
put back into this on a full charge

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.480 
put back into this on a full charge
1,300<00:05:12.030> if<00:05:12.229> you<00:05:13.229> reckon<00:05:13.590> on<00:05:13.680> putting<00:05:14.039> back<00:05:14.280> in

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
1,300 if you reckon on putting back in

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.270 
1,300 if you reckon on putting back in
80%<00:05:15.000> of<00:05:15.510> it<00:05:15.660> each<00:05:15.840> time<00:05:16.099> then<00:05:17.099> you'll

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
80% of it each time then you'll

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.550 
80% of it each time then you'll
generally<00:05:17.520> get<00:05:17.729> a<00:05:17.760> good<00:05:18.060> flight<00:05:18.360> time<00:05:18.660> with

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
generally get a good flight time with

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.680 
generally get a good flight time with
that<00:05:19.830> little<00:05:20.099> bit<00:05:20.340> of<00:05:20.400> reserve<00:05:20.789> just<00:05:21.210> in<00:05:21.419> case

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
that little bit of reserve just in case

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.200 
that little bit of reserve just in case
you're<00:05:22.070> needing<00:05:23.070> it<00:05:23.220> for<00:05:23.490> you<00:05:23.789> know<00:05:23.880> get<00:05:24.090> it

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
you're needing it for you know get it

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.999 
you're needing it for you know get it
back<00:05:24.449> safely<00:05:25.139> or<00:05:25.349> out<00:05:25.530> of<00:05:25.680> bad<00:05:26.310> situation

charging quite happily it will go

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.310 
charging quite happily it will go
through<00:05:38.970> the<00:05:39.030> normal<00:05:39.330> balance<00:05:39.479> phase<00:05:39.930> and

through the normal balance phase and

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.900 
through the normal balance phase and
it's<00:05:40.500> recovered<00:05:41.900> okay
