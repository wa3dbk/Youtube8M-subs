00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:12.959
 First of all, the game was played by referee Richard Liesveld 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.769
 you will not find a yellow card here 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.669
 not being able to find it 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:21.759
 keep me by e-mail Sunday 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:24.789
 later we would start to think differently 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.159
 Ajax does appear to be stiff and in the 43rd minute 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:30.979
 demy denied the zeeuw 13 new arrival 

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:33.500
 ajax without the suspended suarez 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.310
 has trouble with nrc and then now 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.320
 liesveld or not 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.730
 expects to give a yellow card after 48 minutes 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.260
 waited too long to take the free kick hendriks is also a yellow one 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.160
 Map 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.580
 this seems to me quite justified 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.580
 but it can be ns is malnourished 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.870
 Wiljan is rightly angry but there is certain 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.820
 It must have been the title of friend seven minutes before a duck justice time 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.210
 and it becomes even more fun in the extension comes a 7 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.210
 via this ball of currence of clothing 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.990
 the dark this time a lot for sarpong 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.750
 easily given yet from the free kick then the equalizer 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.600
 donny all the world 2 2 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.510
 and then everyone thinks it will be penalties in the arena but it runs 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.929
 otherwise I don't sleep 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:30.340
 also with the violation 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.640
 you have a yellow card 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.920
 and this week with nine men 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.290
 and then there is another free kick 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.700
 how unfortunate camp sarpong are 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.020
 personal accidents 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.390
 the decisive hit 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.200
 by siem de jong 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.330
 ajax with an increasing debt 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.580
 nrc 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.190
 that is, the cards seem to wait a little longer until they are a bit off in it 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.460
 spring of geneva that card we are waiting for 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.909
 yes I have to say I have that moment of emanuelson but I have the dycker 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:00.860
 that depth 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.450
 that is not the moment that the fall is the pursuit in which the suspect but 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.169
 have more but you can just let it hostage 

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:11.889
 After that it's about staying home and not being someone who does this he 

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:16.569
 not in the region 9 this looks like you just had the day at home 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.939
 new is that the elderly woman outperforms two women ten years 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:23.180
 refer to home and abroad and then it is my husband now works at the 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.009
 navy 

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:27.979
 a selection of charities he had expected in a separate mag 

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:32.709
 fate tragedy heerenveen heracles rutten can understand guts 

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:38.359
 no I think that moment of emanuelson knows that via yes if 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:41.899
 You then imagine that this man can and may not answer him intentionally 

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:42.799
 appropriate language 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.469
 it is a breath of fresh air 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:49.279
 it is necessary that it stays on but that these are not breaking points 

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:50.809
 harderwijk new year 

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:54.609
 just for your software and data from american television that the woman 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:58.869
 Recently the body would get a nice July 4th and August were on that 

00:02:58.869 --> 00:03:03.519
 so never miss the moment if you let this continue the next day 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.809
 secondly give yellow card for the rest of asia where is it going well my 

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:10.239
 Fixed on that is not bad in itself but a very nice weather yes it was 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.689
 that is a bit like that of the referee for the Japanese 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:15.669
 perhaps it was something to focus on those two cards that I have been carrying for ten years 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:18.400
 station breda if you have yellow card 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.030
 then you cannot make any violations then you have to restrain yourself 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.170
 so in that month 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.690
 Then a very stupid violation of it was really a yellow card that two 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.890
 once in a while all neighborhoods where the security men were at that 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.619
 moment but maybe a bit expensive 

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:35.779
 he is lame in the movement of people and their social skills 

00:03:35.779 --> 00:03:39.149
 of course what show one in itself 

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:43.199
 technical problems were always played very modestly yes what I did well 

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:46.299
 sit it now just pick up once a violation and broadcast 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.249
 the exhibition of these are former colleagues not fully complete 

00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:51.789
 becomes theatrical 

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:55.459
 the one that wants quite a bit of luck, we are happy with that 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.969
 the roads on the street and also this loan is going on then you can just continue
