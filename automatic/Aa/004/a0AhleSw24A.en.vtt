00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.719 

one<00:00:05.990> of<00:00:06.109> my<00:00:06.229> other<00:00:06.379> subscribers<00:00:07.099> has<00:00:07.370> asked

00:00:07.719 --> 00:00:07.729 
one of my other subscribers has asked

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:09.820 
one of my other subscribers has asked
around<00:00:07.910> what<00:00:08.240> I<00:00:08.269> use<00:00:08.629> for<00:00:08.660> London<00:00:09.200> gear<00:00:09.410> so<00:00:09.769> I

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:09.830 
around what I use for London gear so I

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.020 
around what I use for London gear so I
thought<00:00:10.010> I'd<00:00:10.160> put<00:00:10.340> a<00:00:10.370> very<00:00:10.639> quick<00:00:10.910> video

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.030 
thought I'd put a very quick video

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.170 
thought I'd put a very quick video
together<00:00:11.510> to<00:00:11.780> show<00:00:12.019> how<00:00:12.440> I<00:00:12.740> do<00:00:12.830> it<00:00:13.250> I'm

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:14.180 
together to show how I do it I'm

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.720 
together to show how I do it I'm
actually<00:00:14.359> copying<00:00:15.020> and<00:00:15.369> the<00:00:16.369> landing<00:00:16.670> gear

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730 
actually copying and the landing gear

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.790 
actually copying and the landing gear
that<00:00:17.000> came<00:00:17.210> on<00:00:17.390> the<00:00:17.480> first<00:00:17.660> ever<00:00:17.869> cord<00:00:18.199> that<00:00:18.740> I

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
that came on the first ever cord that I

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.410 
that came on the first ever cord that I
bought<00:00:19.130> that<00:00:19.160> was<00:00:19.430> actually<00:00:19.699> built<00:00:19.910> for<00:00:20.210> me

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
bought that was actually built for me

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.800 
bought that was actually built for me
and<00:00:21.019> it's<00:00:21.980> these<00:00:22.220> legs<00:00:22.820> on<00:00:23.089> the<00:00:23.329> bottom<00:00:23.480> that

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
and it's these legs on the bottom that

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.810 
and it's these legs on the bottom that
we're<00:00:23.900> going<00:00:24.050> to<00:00:24.140> take<00:00:24.409> a<00:00:24.439> closer<00:00:24.769> look<00:00:25.009> at<00:00:25.249> so

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
we're going to take a closer look at so

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.519 
we're going to take a closer look at so
let<00:00:25.939> me<00:00:25.999> just<00:00:26.150> zoom<00:00:26.210> in<00:00:26.630> I<00:00:26.839> can<00:00:27.019> kind<00:00:27.259> of<00:00:27.289> talk

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
let me just zoom in I can kind of talk

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:28.839 
let me just zoom in I can kind of talk
you<00:00:27.589> through<00:00:27.829> what<00:00:27.949> we're<00:00:28.310> looking<00:00:28.669> at<00:00:28.789> here

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
you through what we're looking at here

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.109 
you through what we're looking at here
so<00:00:29.749> these<00:00:30.409> legs<00:00:30.739> are<00:00:31.069> actually<00:00:31.400> simply

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
so these legs are actually simply

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.290 
so these legs are actually simply
standoffs<00:00:32.720> with<00:00:33.020> a<00:00:33.500> rubber<00:00:34.070> foot<00:00:34.430> screwed

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
standoffs with a rubber foot screwed

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.450 
standoffs with a rubber foot screwed
into<00:00:35.510> the<00:00:35.690> bottom<00:00:36.020> and<00:00:36.200> then<00:00:36.770> actually<00:00:37.190> held

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
into the bottom and then actually held

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.950 
into the bottom and then actually held
into<00:00:37.940> the<00:00:38.030> model<00:00:38.390> by<00:00:38.870> a<00:00:39.670> by<00:00:40.670> a<00:00:40.700> small<00:00:41.270> m3<00:00:41.720> not

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
into the model by a by a small m3 not

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.170 
into the model by a by a small m3 not
everything<00:00:42.710> on<00:00:42.830> these<00:00:43.010> standoffs<00:00:43.610> actually

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
everything on these standoffs actually

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.030 
everything on these standoffs actually
the<00:00:44.240> PCB<00:00:44.780> standoffs<00:00:45.290> are<00:00:45.530> actually<00:00:45.830> three

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
the PCB standoffs are actually three

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.770 
the PCB standoffs are actually three
millimeters<00:00:46.640> so<00:00:47.120> if<00:00:47.180> you<00:00:47.270> have<00:00:47.450> any<00:00:47.570> three

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
millimeters so if you have any three

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.200 
millimeters so if you have any three
millimetre<00:00:48.230> screws<00:00:48.410> or<00:00:48.920> washers<00:00:49.700> or<00:00:49.850> bits<00:00:50.060> and

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
millimetre screws or washers or bits and

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.760 
millimetre screws or washers or bits and
pieces<00:00:50.390> you<00:00:50.720> can<00:00:50.900> use<00:00:50.930> it<00:00:51.170> for<00:00:51.290> your<00:00:51.410> landing

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
pieces you can use it for your landing

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.620 
pieces you can use it for your landing
gear<00:00:51.800> so<00:00:52.700> let<00:00:52.820> me<00:00:52.880> show<00:00:53.030> you<00:00:53.090> what<00:00:53.360> it<00:00:53.450> looks

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:53.630 
gear so let me show you what it looks

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.290 
gear so let me show you what it looks
like<00:00:53.870> on<00:00:54.080> the<00:00:54.140> one<00:00:54.410> that<00:00:54.560> I've<00:00:54.680> made<00:00:55.120> so<00:00:56.120> here

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
like on the one that I've made so here

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.520 
like on the one that I've made so here
we<00:00:56.420> are<00:00:56.450> we're<00:00:56.630> looking<00:00:56.660> at<00:00:56.930> the<00:00:56.990> bottom<00:00:57.110> of

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
we are we're looking at the bottom of

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.120 
we are we're looking at the bottom of
the<00:00:57.860> large<00:00:58.130> cord<00:00:58.460> I<00:00:58.610> use<00:00:58.820> recently<00:00:59.300> for<00:00:59.600> my

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.130 
the large cord I use recently for my

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.179 
the large cord I use recently for my
motor<00:01:01.130> prop<00:01:01.940> comparison<00:01:02.840> video<00:01:03.140> and<00:01:03.410> here

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
motor prop comparison video and here

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:05.859 
motor prop comparison video and here
they<00:01:04.309> are<00:01:04.339> just<00:01:04.489> protecting<00:01:05.210> the<00:01:05.239> battery<00:01:05.630> at

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
they are just protecting the battery at

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:07.960 
they are just protecting the battery at
the<00:01:05.900> bottom<00:01:06.350> so<00:01:06.860> again<00:01:07.100> if<00:01:07.220> i<00:01:07.310> zoom<00:01:07.549> in<00:01:07.670> we<00:01:07.820> can

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
the bottom so again if i zoom in we can

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.670 
the bottom so again if i zoom in we can
quickly<00:01:08.150> show<00:01:08.420> you<00:01:08.450> what<00:01:08.570> they<00:01:08.750> look<00:01:08.869> like<00:01:08.930> so

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
quickly show you what they look like so

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.130 
quickly show you what they look like so
here<00:01:09.950> again<00:01:10.280> all<00:01:10.730> I've<00:01:10.850> done<00:01:11.000> is<00:01:11.060> just<00:01:11.330> drilled

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
here again all I've done is just drilled

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.760 
here again all I've done is just drilled
a<00:01:12.320> three<00:01:12.710> mil<00:01:12.950> hole<00:01:13.190> into<00:01:13.580> the<00:01:13.790> bottom<00:01:14.060> plate<00:01:14.270> a

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
a three mil hole into the bottom plate a

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.000 
a three mil hole into the bottom plate a
25<00:01:15.770> mil<00:01:16.130> stand<00:01:16.490> off<00:01:16.670> a<00:01:17.210> rubber<00:01:17.780> foot<00:01:18.110> and<00:01:18.350> held

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
25 mil stand off a rubber foot and held

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.520 
25 mil stand off a rubber foot and held
in<00:01:19.159> place<00:01:19.190> with<00:01:19.670> a<00:01:20.030> nylon<00:01:20.270> screw<00:01:20.780> these<00:01:21.260> things

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
in place with a nylon screw these things

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.810 
in place with a nylon screw these things
are<00:01:21.650> nice<00:01:21.770> and<00:01:22.010> light<00:01:22.130> today<00:01:22.370> they're<00:01:22.700> not

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
are nice and light today they're not

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.880 
are nice and light today they're not
super<00:01:23.210> robust<00:01:23.540> if<00:01:23.690> you<00:01:23.780> put<00:01:24.020> in<00:01:24.140> a<00:01:24.290> hard<00:01:24.560> crash

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
super robust if you put in a hard crash

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.790 
super robust if you put in a hard crash
they<00:01:25.370> will<00:01:25.580> snap<00:01:25.970> off<00:01:26.210> and<00:01:26.450> but<00:01:27.350> for<00:01:27.500> the<00:01:27.560> cost

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
they will snap off and but for the cost

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.110 
they will snap off and but for the cost
of<00:01:27.920> them<00:01:28.100> they're<00:01:28.280> quite<00:01:28.490> cheap<00:01:28.729> and<00:01:28.909> cheerful

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
of them they're quite cheap and cheerful

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.030 
of them they're quite cheap and cheerful
so<00:01:29.930> let<00:01:30.050> me<00:01:30.140> show<00:01:30.290> you<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:30.470> individual

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
so let me show you the individual

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.560 
so let me show you the individual
components<00:01:31.640> and<00:01:31.729> you<00:01:31.850> can<00:01:32.000> see<00:01:32.210> how<00:01:32.390> they're

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
components and you can see how they're

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.690 
components and you can see how they're
made<00:01:32.750> up<00:01:32.960> so<00:01:33.860> here<00:01:34.040> are<00:01:34.130> the<00:01:34.220> four<00:01:34.370> elements

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
made up so here are the four elements

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.180 
made up so here are the four elements
the<00:01:35.000> first<00:01:35.150> one<00:01:35.450> is<00:01:35.659> the<00:01:35.930> standoff<00:01:36.350> I<00:01:36.560> use

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
the first one is the standoff I use

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.260 
the first one is the standoff I use
these<00:01:37.490> size<00:01:39.310> which<00:01:40.310> is<00:01:40.490> actually<00:01:40.820> 25

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
these size which is actually 25

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.990 
these size which is actually 25
millimetres<00:01:42.110> they<00:01:42.799> have<00:01:43.100> a<00:01:43.310> thread<00:01:43.640> on<00:01:43.670> one

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
millimetres they have a thread on one

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.460 
millimetres they have a thread on one
end<00:01:44.180> and<00:01:44.479> a<00:01:44.540> hole<00:01:44.720> in<00:01:44.870> the<00:01:44.930> other<00:01:45.049> factually

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
end and a hole in the other factually

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.219 
end and a hole in the other factually
PCB<00:01:46.100> spaces<00:01:46.670> you<00:01:47.090> can<00:01:47.210> buy<00:01:47.360> them<00:01:47.540> in<00:01:47.630> quick<00:01:47.900> and
