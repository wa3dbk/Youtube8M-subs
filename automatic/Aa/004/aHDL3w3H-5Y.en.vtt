 halloween is just around the corner 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:12.170
 so I'll teach you how to do these 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:17.859
 nails from another planet for it 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:20.560
 we need beige with a pink glaze 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:27.740
 blue 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:30.580
 purple and light blue a black enamel tip 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.970
 thin top coat 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.800
 lime 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:40.840
 artificial nails 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:44.649
 glass with water toothpick sticks and 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:48.030
 double sided tape we will start taking out the 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:50.250
 false nail to file the 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:55.070
 in this case I will give you a form 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.070
 almond with a lime number 100 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.840
 then with a lime sponge I will retire 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.840
 any excess 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.020
 on a stick I will put double peace ribbon or 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.020
 double face 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:17.150
 and paste on the nail this will facilitate me the 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:19.430
 I work in a glass with water to start 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.090
 place drops of different colors and in 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.090
 any order 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.010
 yes 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.600
 then with a toothpick I will start to give 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.400
 the way I want the idea is that it 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.700
 Mix the colors and make lines with 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.700
 they 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.159
 when you're happy with the result 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.180
 dip the nail and remove the excess 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.180
 enamel with a contact 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:12.550
 then with a black enamel and a brush 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.550
 thin we will make lines simulating veins 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.310
 Y 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:24.379
 ah 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:31.770
 ah 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.770
 we will seal all this by applying top coat 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.650
 to open the false nail to our nail 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.650
 apply beschos 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.260
 you can stick it with top coat but if 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.220
 you want it to last you even more 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.220
 glue for today 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.790
 and just need to press a little and that's 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.650
