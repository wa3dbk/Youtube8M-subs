do that first off you have to drain the

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.589 
do that first off you have to drain the
radiator<00:00:14.330> okay

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
radiator okay

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.660 
radiator okay
thermostat<00:00:16.560> is<00:00:16.770> located<00:00:16.800> right<00:00:17.460> here<00:00:18.260> in<00:00:19.260> this

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
thermostat is located right here in this

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.870 
thermostat is located right here in this
tri<00:00:20.670> housing<00:00:21.210> right<00:00:21.420> here<00:00:22.340> but<00:00:23.340> first<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:23.760> got

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
tri housing right here but first you got

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.509 
tri housing right here but first you got
to<00:00:23.910> drain<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.510> radiator<00:00:24.600> because<00:00:25.109> if<00:00:25.230> not

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:25.519 
to drain the radiator because if not

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:27.290 
to drain the radiator because if not
antifreeze<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.580> water<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:27.029> going<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.210> go

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
antifreeze and water is going to go

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.650 
antifreeze and water is going to go
everywhere<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:28.580> first<00:00:29.580> off<00:00:29.820> take<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.210> cap<00:00:30.420> out

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
everywhere so first off take the cap out

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.610 
everywhere so first off take the cap out
a<00:00:32.660> little<00:00:33.660> bit<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.840> water<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.110> will<00:00:34.170> spew<00:00:34.559> out

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
a little bit of water it will spew out

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.750 
a little bit of water it will spew out
but<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.790> shouldn't<00:00:36.149> be<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.239> lot<00:00:36.480> because<00:00:37.469> the

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
but it shouldn't be a lot because the

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.830 
but it shouldn't be a lot because the
reservoir<00:00:38.760> caps<00:00:39.030> up<00:00:39.210> top<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:39.450> it's<00:00:39.750> like

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
reservoir caps up top so it's like

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.420 
reservoir caps up top so it's like
suctioned<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.469> off<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:40.800> what<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:40.950> did<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.399> took

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
suctioned it off so what I did is I took

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.190 
suctioned it off so what I did is I took
a<00:00:41.640> smaller<00:00:41.940> hose<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:44.690> wedge<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:46.020> then

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
a smaller hose and wedge it in then

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.410 
a smaller hose and wedge it in then
there<00:00:46.410> so<00:00:47.340> then<00:00:47.520> we<00:00:47.610> got<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.850> drain<00:00:48.059> into<00:00:48.300> our

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
there so then we got it drain into our

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.990 
there so then we got it drain into our
pans<00:00:48.710> out<00:00:49.710> here<00:00:51.649> which<00:00:52.649> it's<00:00:53.280> coming<00:00:53.640> out<00:00:53.760> and

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
pans out here which it's coming out and

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.770 
pans out here which it's coming out and
if<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.239> undo<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.690> cap<00:00:55.250> as<00:00:56.270> Ryan's<00:00:57.270> doing<00:00:57.449> see

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
if you undo the cap as Ryan's doing see

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.770 
if you undo the cap as Ryan's doing see
it's<00:00:57.989> coming<00:00:58.170> out<00:00:58.320> good<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:59.149> this<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.390> really

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
it's coming out good so this is a really

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.810 
it's coming out good so this is a really
easy<00:01:00.809> way<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.980> do<00:01:02.100> without<00:01:02.340> it

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
easy way to do without it

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.009 
easy way to do without it
getting<00:01:03.210> all<00:01:03.270> over<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.510> frame<00:01:03.840> and

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
getting all over the frame and

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.380 
getting all over the frame and
everything<00:01:04.850> because<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:05.970> usually<00:01:06.210> doesn't

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
everything because it usually doesn't

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.200 
everything because it usually doesn't
even<00:01:06.570> go<00:01:06.689> in<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.840> bucket<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:08.000> so<00:01:09.000> we're<00:01:09.090> gonna

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
even go in the bucket so so we're gonna

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.120 
even go in the bucket so so we're gonna
let<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.360> go<00:01:09.630> for<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.869> minute<00:01:10.200> alright<00:01:10.890> I've

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
let that go for a minute alright I've

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.460 
let that go for a minute alright I've
started<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:12.000> take<00:01:12.510> this<00:01:12.689> out<00:01:12.960> it's<00:01:13.260> almost

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
started to take this out it's almost

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.740 
started to take this out it's almost
drained<00:01:13.920> completely<00:01:14.330> you<00:01:15.330> need<00:01:15.509> an<00:01:15.600> 8

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
drained completely you need an 8

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.289 
drained completely you need an 8
millimeter<00:01:16.520> it's<00:01:17.520> going<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.790> still<00:01:18.000> come<00:01:18.180> out

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
millimeter it's going to still come out

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.300 
millimeter it's going to still come out
a<00:01:18.330> little<00:01:18.509> bit<00:01:18.750> just<00:01:18.780> slowly<00:01:19.530> go<00:01:19.799> with<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.220> and

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
a little bit just slowly go with it and

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:35.230 
a little bit just slowly go with it and
let<00:01:20.430> it

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.120 

this<00:01:36.240> will<00:01:36.420> take<00:01:36.539> a<00:01:36.600> little<00:01:36.810> while<00:01:37.070> all<00:01:38.070> right

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130

this will take a little while all right
now<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.520> just<00:01:38.850> gotta<00:01:39.000> use<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.299> flathead<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.229> pry

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
now you just gotta use a flathead to pry

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.990 
now you just gotta use a flathead to pry
it<00:01:40.500> off<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.829> there<00:01:40.920> more<00:01:41.340> water<00:01:41.579> will<00:01:41.820> come

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
it off and there more water will come

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.270 
it off and there more water will come
out<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.390> be<00:01:42.539> ready<00:01:42.750> cuz<00:01:43.110> we<00:01:43.710> didn't<00:01:43.950> expect
