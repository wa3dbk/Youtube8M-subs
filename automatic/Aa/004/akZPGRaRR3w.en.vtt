shadow<00:02:39.460> and<00:02:40.460> this<00:02:41.060> was<00:02:41.240> why<00:02:41.450> it<00:02:41.510> was<00:02:41.840> important

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
shadow and this was why it was important

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.500

so that their transition from the

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.270 
so that their transition from the
eyeliner<00:02:47.180> and<00:02:47.630> the<00:02:48.110> shadow<00:02:48.350> is<00:02:48.470> a<00:02:48.709> lot<00:02:49.040> more

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280
