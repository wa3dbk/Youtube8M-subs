keep watching but um I was gonna buy a
DFS<00:02:38.959> and<00:02:39.760> I<00:02:40.760> put<00:02:41.390> it<00:02:41.480> in<00:02:41.629> for<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.950> guide<00:02:43.160> price

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
DFS and I put it in for the guide price

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.440 
DFS and I put it in for the guide price
on<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:43.910> GE<00:02:44.180> but<00:02:44.629> it<00:02:45.409> would<00:02:45.620> not<00:02:45.769> buy<00:02:46.040> I<00:02:46.450> think

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
on the GE but it would not buy I think

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.900 
on the GE but it would not buy I think
the<00:02:47.540> guide<00:02:47.720> price<00:02:48.019> was<00:02:48.290> 18<00:02:49.190> mil<00:02:49.400> and<00:02:49.640> it<00:02:49.730> would

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
the guide price was 18 mil and it would

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.550 
the guide price was 18 mil and it would
not<00:02:50.090> buy<00:02:50.239> so<00:02:51.310> um<00:02:52.310> I<00:02:53.239> just<00:02:53.599> I<00:02:53.989> just<00:02:54.019> took<00:02:54.290> it<00:02:54.349> out

because I don't know what to do now

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:57.580
