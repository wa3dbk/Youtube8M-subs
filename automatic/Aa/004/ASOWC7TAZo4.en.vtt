I<00:01:15.780> was<00:01:16.560> thinking<00:01:16.680> about<00:01:16.890> running<00:01:17.130> one<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:17.909> this

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
I was thinking about running one of this

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.890 
I was thinking about running one of this
but<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.600> decided<00:01:18.960> running<00:01:19.320> too<00:01:19.530> because<00:01:20.900> with

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
but I decided running too because with

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.980 
but I decided running too because with
the<00:01:22.020> banned<00:01:22.200> list<00:01:22.290> in<00:01:23.159> sectors<00:01:23.759> are<00:01:24.030> gone<00:01:24.689> but

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
the banned list in sectors are gone but

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.200 
the banned list in sectors are gone but
wind<00:01:25.229> up<00:01:25.409> some<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.920> Donna<00:01:26.580> rapture<00:01:27.000> still

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
wind up some and Donna rapture still

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.530 
wind up some and Donna rapture still
there<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.570> this<00:01:27.750> basically<00:01:27.960> kills<00:01:28.530> any

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
there and this basically kills any

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.090 
there and this basically kills any
exceeds<00:01:30.540> which<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:31.140> done<00:01:31.320> on<00:01:31.470> Robinson<00:01:31.890> wind

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
exceeds which is done on Robinson wind

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.640 
exceeds which is done on Robinson wind
up<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:33.329> really<00:01:33.509> helps<00:01:33.930> out<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.110> lot<00:01:34.259> in<00:01:34.560> the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
up so this really helps out a lot in the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.819 
up so this really helps out a lot in the
end<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.159> decided<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.549> run<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.829> plus

run one photon strike bounzer in the end

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.010 
run one photon strike bounzer in the end
so<00:02:28.100> it<00:02:28.610> allows<00:02:28.820> me<00:02:29.030> for<00:02:29.210> that<00:02:29.360> it's<00:02:29.630> special

banlist the third failure is not as

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.290 
banlist the third failure is not as
needed<00:02:53.930> so<00:02:54.530> just<00:02:54.860> two<00:02:55.040> is<00:02:55.190> fine<00:02:55.400> for<00:02:55.640> the

in the video but anyways you've got the
solemn<00:04:00.430> brigade<00:04:00.790> I<00:04:01.230> think<00:04:02.230> it's<00:04:02.410> necessary<00:04:02.890> in

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
solemn brigade I think it's necessary in

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.650 
solemn brigade I think it's necessary in
almost<00:04:03.310> every<00:04:03.640> deck<00:04:03.850> there<00:04:04.030> are<00:04:04.150> exceptions

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
almost every deck there are exceptions

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.120 
almost every deck there are exceptions
such<00:04:04.900> as<00:04:04.960> a<00:04:05.140> deck<00:04:05.380> that<00:04:05.410> pays<00:04:05.740> a<00:04:05.770> lot<00:04:05.920> of<00:04:06.010> Life

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
such as a deck that pays a lot of Life

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.910 
such as a deck that pays a lot of Life
Points<00:04:06.600> or<00:04:07.600> something<00:04:08.200> like<00:04:08.290> six<00:04:08.590> samurais

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
Points or something like six samurais

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.320 
Points or something like six samurais
which<00:04:09.190> you<00:04:09.310> don't<00:04:09.400> need<00:04:09.580> solemn<00:04:09.910> judgment<00:04:10.270> in

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
which you don't need solemn judgment in

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.430 
which you don't need solemn judgment in
that<00:04:10.420> deck<00:04:10.630> because<00:04:10.930> you've<00:04:11.080> gone<00:04:11.200> with

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
that deck because you've gone with

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.560 
that deck because you've gone with
sacani<00:04:11.740> manga<00:04:12.100> thomas<00:04:12.460> stuff<00:04:12.760> like<00:04:12.910> that<00:04:12.940> but

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
sacani manga thomas stuff like that but

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:14.970 
sacani manga thomas stuff like that but
this<00:04:13.720> doesn't<00:04:14.200> have<00:04:14.290> any<00:04:14.470> of<00:04:14.560> that<00:04:14.590> and<00:04:14.890> it

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
this doesn't have any of that and it

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.710 
this doesn't have any of that and it
doesn't<00:04:15.310> care<00:04:15.880> about<00:04:15.970> its<00:04:16.209> life<00:04:16.330> points<00:04:16.630> as

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
doesn't care about its life points as

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.470 
doesn't care about its life points as
much<00:04:16.930> so<00:04:17.260> the<00:04:17.970> somber<00:04:18.970> gate<00:04:19.120> is<00:04:19.239> kind<00:04:19.390> of

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
much so the somber gate is kind of

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.260 
much so the somber gate is kind of
necessary<00:04:19.720> with<00:04:19.989> this<00:04:20.110> deck<00:04:20.790> to<00:04:21.790> bear<00:04:22.030> Force
