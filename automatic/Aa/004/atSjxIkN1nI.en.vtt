00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.779 
this particular saw here I believe this
is<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.240> original<00:00:21.750> blade<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.260> chain<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:23.580> when

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
is the original blade and chain and when

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.230 
is the original blade and chain and when
you<00:00:23.880> look<00:00:24.060> at<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.420> it's<00:00:24.630> in<00:00:24.869> mint<00:00:25.050> condition

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
you look at it it's in mint condition

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.980 
you look at it it's in mint condition
even<00:00:27.240> underneath<00:00:27.480> it's<00:00:28.019> hardly<00:00:28.380> scratched

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
even underneath it's hardly scratched

now what I just did to this saw is I
took<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.969> cover<00:00:33.329> off<00:00:33.420> here<00:00:33.840> tine<00:00:34.140> down<00:00:34.380> these

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
took the cover off here tine down these

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.799 
took the cover off here tine down these
cylinder<00:00:35.070> bolts<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.610> check<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.329> impulse

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
cylinder bolts and check the impulse

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.229 
cylinder bolts and check the impulse
line<00:00:37.110> it's<00:00:37.410> good<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:38.460> issue<00:00:38.670> with<00:00:38.820> this<00:00:38.969> saw

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
line it's good the issue with this saw

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.510 
line it's good the issue with this saw
is<00:00:39.420> intermittent<00:00:40.200> it'll<00:00:40.800> run<00:00:40.980> really<00:00:41.309> good

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
is intermittent it'll run really good

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.090 
is intermittent it'll run really good
but<00:00:41.820> sometimes<00:00:42.300> under<00:00:42.660> load<00:00:42.899> after<00:00:43.440> 30

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
but sometimes under load after 30

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.340 
but sometimes under load after 30
seconds<00:00:44.579> or<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.210> dies<00:00:45.480> down<00:00:45.510> then<00:00:46.140> goes

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
seconds or so it dies down then goes

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.590 
seconds or so it dies down then goes
back<00:00:46.379> up<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.700> what<00:00:47.879> I'm<00:00:47.969> going<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.149> do<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.390> take

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.420 
the carburetor apart I'm going to
replace<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.640> carb<00:00:50.850> kit<00:00:51.260> regardless<00:00:52.309> just<00:00:53.309> to

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.100 

the<00:01:33.090> very<00:01:33.299> first<00:01:33.600> thing<00:01:33.750> I'm<00:01:33.900> going<00:01:34.049> to

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
the very first thing I'm going to

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.749 
the very first thing I'm going to
disconnect<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.130> throttle<00:01:35.580> linkage

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
disconnect is the throttle linkage

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.300 
disconnect is the throttle linkage
you'll<00:01:36.299> just<00:01:36.479> grab<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.750> with<00:01:36.930> pliers<00:01:37.380> lift<00:01:38.100> it

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
you'll just grab it with pliers lift it

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.880 
you'll just grab it with pliers lift it
up<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.700> move<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.840> side<00:01:40.049> like<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.500> and

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
up and move it to the side like that and

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.859 
up and move it to the side like that and
now<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.700> can<00:01:42.060> start<00:01:42.570> pulling<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.020> carb<00:01:43.290> out

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
now you can start pulling the carb out

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.910 
now you can start pulling the carb out
you're<00:01:45.869> going<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.080> feel<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.649> impulse

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
you're going to feel that the impulse

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.310 
you're going to feel that the impulse
line<00:01:47.220> has<00:01:47.490> disconnected<00:01:47.790> itself<00:01:48.630> that's<00:01:48.990> okay

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
line has disconnected itself that's okay

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.190 
line has disconnected itself that's okay
so<00:01:50.039> there's<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.549> impulse<00:01:50.909> line<00:01:51.330> connector

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
so there's the impulse line connector

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.469 
so there's the impulse line connector
and<00:01:52.440> the<00:01:52.740> lines<00:01:52.950> right<00:01:53.159> here<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:54.210> now<00:01:54.420> you

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
and the lines right here and now you

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.210 
and the lines right here and now you
want<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.869> disconnect<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.500> fuel<00:01:55.740> line<00:01:55.979> with

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
want to disconnect the fuel line with

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.139 
want to disconnect the fuel line with
the<00:01:56.369> dull<00:01:56.549> screwdriver<00:01:57.180> just<00:01:57.899> push<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.350> down

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
the dull screwdriver just push it down

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.670 
the dull screwdriver just push it down
and<00:02:00.149> now<00:02:00.509> just<00:02:00.840> pull<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.110> carburetor<00:02:01.530> right

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
and now just pull the carburetor right

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.859 
and now just pull the carburetor right
out<00:02:02.210> it's<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.420> easy

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
out it's that easy

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.680 
out it's that easy
now<00:02:04.560> here's<00:02:04.800> the<00:02:05.039> carburetor<00:02:05.640> for<00:02:05.909> that<00:02:06.090> it's

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
now here's the carburetor for that it's

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.229

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
not going to matter because this is

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.460 
not going to matter because this is
where<00:04:19.980> it<00:04:20.100> went<00:04:20.280> on<00:04:20.520> the<00:04:20.640> carb<00:04:20.910> and<00:04:21.320> the<00:04:22.320> holes

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
where it went on the carb and the holes

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
right here on the old one so there was

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.090 
right here on the old one so there was
no<00:04:24.510> hole<00:04:24.900> under<00:04:25.230> there<00:04:25.440> so<00:04:25.710> it<00:04:25.770> won't<00:04:25.860> matter

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
no hole under there so it won't matter

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.760 
no hole under there so it won't matter
and<00:04:26.720> I'll<00:04:27.720> just<00:04:27.930> show<00:04:28.110> you<00:04:28.140> that<00:04:28.230> on<00:04:28.500> the<00:04:28.650> old

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
and I'll just show you that on the old

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.120 
and I'll just show you that on the old
one<00:04:29.010> so<00:04:29.190> you<00:04:29.580> can<00:04:29.730> see<00:04:29.790> one<00:04:30.210> here<00:04:30.240> and<00:04:31.130> there's

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
one so you can see one here and there's

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.560 
one so you can see one here and there's
no<00:04:32.250> hole<00:04:32.400> back<00:04:32.580> there<00:04:32.610> so<00:04:33.000> it<00:04:33.090> doesn't<00:04:33.420> matter

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
no hole back there so it doesn't matter

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.620 
no hole back there so it doesn't matter
if<00:04:33.840> I'm<00:04:34.230> using<00:04:34.380> the<00:04:34.620> blue<00:04:34.800> one<00:04:34.980> now<00:04:35.420> these<00:04:36.420> are

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
if I'm using the blue one now these are

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.920 
if I'm using the blue one now these are
the<00:04:36.660> diaphragms<00:04:37.200> I<00:04:37.410> got<00:04:37.650> out<00:04:37.770> of<00:04:37.950> the<00:04:38.040> kit<00:04:38.310> and

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
the diaphragms I got out of the kit and

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.900 
the diaphragms I got out of the kit and
this<00:04:39.930> is<00:04:40.080> what's<00:04:40.290> left<00:04:40.620> in<00:04:40.860> the<00:04:40.920> new<00:04:41.400> kit<00:04:41.640> so

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
this is what's left in the new kit so

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:42.890 
this is what's left in the new kit so
don't<00:04:42.120> worry<00:04:42.240> about<00:04:42.420> that

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
don't worry about that

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.500 
don't worry about that
they're<00:04:43.080> just<00:04:43.290> excess<00:04:43.940> the<00:04:44.940> reason<00:04:45.240> they<00:04:45.330> put

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
they're just excess the reason they put

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:46.910 
they're just excess the reason they put
extras<00:04:45.930> in<00:04:46.110> there<00:04:46.290> is<00:04:46.410> because<00:04:46.560> some

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:46.920 
extras in there is because some

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.030 
extras in there is because some
carburetors<00:04:47.550> slightly<00:04:48.300> differ<00:04:49.040> therefore

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
carburetors slightly differ therefore

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
carburetors slightly differ therefore
you<00:04:50.130> would<00:04:50.280> have<00:04:50.430> to<00:04:50.580> use<00:04:50.730> a<00:04:50.760> different

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
you would have to use a different

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.350 
you would have to use a different
diaphragm<00:04:52.050> for<00:04:52.470> a<00:04:52.530> different<00:04:52.919> carb<00:04:53.270> now<00:04:54.270> if

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
diaphragm for a different carb now if

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.050 
diaphragm for a different carb now if
you<00:04:54.480> bought<00:04:54.720> a<00:04:54.750> k10<00:04:55.320> watt<00:04:55.560> kit<00:04:55.919> or<00:04:56.100> AK<00:04:56.370> a<00:04:56.580> 20

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
you bought a k10 watt kit or AK a 20

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.060 
you bought a k10 watt kit or AK a 20
watt<00:04:57.090> kit<00:04:57.630> you

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
watt kit you

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.440 
watt kit you
have<00:04:58.190> the<00:04:58.340> hardware<00:04:58.730> in<00:04:58.880> there<00:04:59.030> like<00:04:59.330> the

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
have the hardware in there like the

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.840 
have the hardware in there like the
needle<00:04:59.780> lever<00:05:00.020> and<00:05:00.410> the<00:05:01.220> little<00:05:01.490> screen<00:05:01.820> that

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
needle lever and the little screen that

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.820 
needle lever and the little screen that
goes<00:05:02.240> over<00:05:02.480> here<00:05:02.510> if<00:05:03.320> you<00:05:03.410> were<00:05:03.530> doing<00:05:03.770> a

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
goes over here if you were doing a

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.920 
goes over here if you were doing a
complete<00:05:04.220> rebuild<00:05:04.580> you<00:05:04.850> would<00:05:05.000> remove<00:05:05.300> the

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
complete rebuild you would remove the

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:11.620 
complete rebuild you would remove the
needle<00:05:06.200> and<00:05:06.580> the<00:05:07.580> lever<00:05:07.850> and<00:05:08.120> the<00:05:08.240> pin<00:05:10.450> just<00:05:11.450> by

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
needle and the lever and the pin just by

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.160 
needle and the lever and the pin just by
loosening<00:05:12.050> the<00:05:12.230> screw<00:05:12.590> about<00:05:12.830> 3/4<00:05:13.760> way<00:05:14.360> up<00:05:14.570> you

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170 
loosening the screw about 3/4 way up you

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:16.750 
loosening the screw about 3/4 way up you
don't<00:05:15.290> need<00:05:15.440> to<00:05:15.650> completely<00:05:16.160> remove<00:05:16.580> that

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
don't need to completely remove that

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:22.500 
don't need to completely remove that
screw<00:05:17.090> and<00:05:18.280> then<00:05:19.280> you<00:05:19.460> would<00:05:19.640> pull<00:05:20.330> that<00:05:20.510> out

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
screw and then you would pull that out

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.120 
screw and then you would pull that out
don't<00:05:23.510> use<00:05:23.750> that<00:05:23.780> little<00:05:24.110> spring<00:05:24.560> right<00:05:24.830> here

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
don't use that little spring right here

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.150 
don't use that little spring right here
and<00:05:25.810> you<00:05:26.810> can<00:05:26.960> just<00:05:27.140> dump<00:05:27.410> it<00:05:27.590> like<00:05:27.740> that<00:05:27.920> and

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
and you can just dump it like that and

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.040 
and you can just dump it like that and
the<00:05:28.670> needle<00:05:28.940> and<00:05:29.090> spring<00:05:29.390> will<00:05:29.540> fall

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
the needle and spring will fall

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:36.430 
the needle and spring will fall
I<00:05:33.490> only<00:05:34.490> replaced<00:05:35.000> the<00:05:35.210> Welsh<00:05:35.390> plug<00:05:35.780> the

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
I only replaced the Welsh plug the

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.770 
I only replaced the Welsh plug the
carburetor<00:05:36.860> is<00:05:36.950> corroded<00:05:37.580> or<00:05:37.760> if<00:05:38.450> it's<00:05:38.570> been

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
carburetor is corroded or if it's been

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.020 
carburetor is corroded or if it's been
sitting<00:05:39.110> outside<00:05:39.230> in<00:05:39.500> the<00:05:39.620> rain<00:05:39.830> so<00:05:40.760> in<00:05:40.880> this

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030 
sitting outside in the rain so in this

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.640 
sitting outside in the rain so in this
case<00:05:41.270> there<00:05:41.510> is<00:05:41.540> no<00:05:41.900> need<00:05:41.930> to<00:05:42.170> remove<00:05:42.410> the

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
case there is no need to remove the

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.740 
case there is no need to remove the
Welsh<00:05:42.830> plug<00:05:43.160> it's<00:05:43.610> really<00:05:44.030> rare<00:05:44.240> that<00:05:44.270> I<00:05:44.540> have

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
Welsh plug it's really rare that I have

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.500 
Welsh plug it's really rare that I have
to<00:05:44.870> replace<00:05:45.080> those<00:05:45.790> next<00:05:46.790> would<00:05:47.090> flick<00:05:47.360> your

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
to replace those next would flick your

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.530 
to replace those next would flick your
carburetor<00:05:48.050> over<00:05:48.500> and<00:05:48.820> you<00:05:49.820> could<00:05:50.000> remove<00:05:50.330> the

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:50.540 
carburetor over and you could remove the

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.310 
carburetor over and you could remove the
little<00:05:50.930> screen<00:05:51.320> here<00:05:51.350> with<00:05:51.830> the<00:05:51.950> sharp<00:05:52.280> kick

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320 
little screen here with the sharp kick

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.960 
little screen here with the sharp kick
bring<00:05:54.320> it<00:05:54.500> up<00:05:56.980> I'm<00:05:57.980> going<00:05:58.160> to<00:05:58.220> reuse<00:05:58.430> it<00:05:58.760> so<00:05:58.940> I

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970 
bring it up I'm going to reuse it so I

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:06.720 
bring it up I'm going to reuse it so I
don't<00:05:59.120> want<00:05:59.270> to<00:05:59.300> damage<00:05:59.570> it<00:06:02.140> there<00:06:03.140> you<00:06:03.230> go

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:06.730 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:08.910 

sometimes<00:06:07.660> these<00:06:07.870> little<00:06:07.930> screens<00:06:08.530> can<00:06:08.740> look

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:08.920 
sometimes these little screens can look

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.490 
sometimes these little screens can look
clean<00:06:09.220> but<00:06:10.150> the<00:06:10.270> fuel<00:06:10.570> may<00:06:10.720> have<00:06:10.870> varna<00:06:11.260> sized

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
clean but the fuel may have varna sized

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.800 
clean but the fuel may have varna sized
over<00:06:11.920> the<00:06:12.070> years<00:06:12.430> and<00:06:12.730> it<00:06:13.210> could<00:06:13.360> be<00:06:13.480> plugged

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
over the years and it could be plugged

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.780 
over the years and it could be plugged
so<00:06:14.020> you<00:06:14.110> want<00:06:14.290> to<00:06:14.350> make<00:06:14.470> sure<00:06:14.620> that<00:06:14.800> these<00:06:15.070> are

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:15.790 
so you want to make sure that these are

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.330 
so you want to make sure that these are
not<00:06:16.030> plugged<00:06:16.300> up<00:06:16.830> next<00:06:17.830> you'd<00:06:17.920> want<00:06:18.100> to<00:06:18.160> make

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 
not plugged up next you'd want to make

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.160 
not plugged up next you'd want to make
sure<00:06:18.370> you<00:06:18.610> can<00:06:18.820> see<00:06:19.030> daylight<00:06:19.300> through<00:06:19.750> the

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:20.170 
sure you can see daylight through the

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:22.530 
sure you can see daylight through the
hole<00:06:20.350> here<00:06:20.590> where<00:06:21.460> the<00:06:21.670> screen<00:06:21.970> goes<00:06:22.180> here

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:22.540 
hole here where the screen goes here

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.950 
hole here where the screen goes here
this<00:06:22.840> is<00:06:23.020> the<00:06:23.200> hole<00:06:23.440> that<00:06:23.710> goes<00:06:24.250> to<00:06:24.490> the<00:06:24.610> needle

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 
this is the hole that goes to the needle

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.110 
this is the hole that goes to the needle
that<00:06:25.960> lets<00:06:26.140> the<00:06:26.320> fuel<00:06:26.590> go<00:06:26.800> in<00:06:26.920> the<00:06:27.040> carb<00:06:27.310> so

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:28.120 
that lets the fuel go in the carb so

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.630 
that lets the fuel go in the carb so
that's<00:06:28.450> all<00:06:28.750> clean<00:06:29.080> you<00:06:29.350> could<00:06:30.070> also<00:06:30.340> spread
