00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
to show you how I learn how to speed

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.929 
to show you how I learn how to speed
pick<00:00:21.710> first<00:00:22.710> I'm<00:00:22.830> going<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:22.980> show<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.130> how<00:00:23.910> I

pick first I'm going to show you how I

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.490 
pick first I'm going to show you how I
learned<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.660> then<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.900> techniques<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.350> can

learned and then the techniques you can
do<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:25.710> getting<00:00:25.920> better<00:00:26.010> so<00:00:26.939> first<00:00:27.240> off<00:00:27.449> I'm

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
do it getting better so first off I'm

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.759

going<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.720> show<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:27.869> my<00:00:28.019> finger<00:00:28.289> positioning

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
going to show you my finger positioning

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.900 
going to show you my finger positioning
with<00:00:29.189> my<00:00:29.340> right<00:00:29.550> finger<00:00:29.939> I<00:00:30.410> hold<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.500> pick

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
with my right finger I hold the pick

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.389 
with my right finger I hold the pick
pretty<00:00:32.910> close<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.750> top<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.920> when<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:35.070> strum

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
pretty close to the top so when I strum

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.490 
pretty close to the top so when I strum
the<00:00:35.489> low<00:00:35.670> E<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:36.090> have<00:00:36.510> my<00:00:36.630> treble<00:00:36.960> switch<00:00:37.140> all

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
the low E I have my treble switch all

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.250 
the low E I have my treble switch all
the<00:00:37.710> way<00:00:37.739> up<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.160> rhythm<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:39.059> what<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.780> do<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:40.140> I

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
the way up to rhythm and what I do is I

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.220 
the way up to rhythm and what I do is I
just<00:00:40.290> kind<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.649> go<00:00:40.770> back<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.010> forth

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.500 

but<00:00:45.100> what<00:00:45.399> I've<00:00:45.520> learned<00:00:45.550> how<00:00:45.970> to<00:00:46.000> do<00:00:46.210> is<00:00:46.360> I<00:00:46.450> can

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
but what I've learned how to do is I can

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.110 
but what I've learned how to do is I can
make<00:00:47.140> I<00:00:47.350> kind<00:00:47.770> of<00:00:47.800> hold<00:00:47.980> my<00:00:48.070> wrist<00:00:48.370> on<00:00:48.670> the<00:00:48.880> fret

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
make I kind of hold my wrist on the fret

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.869 
make I kind of hold my wrist on the fret
board<00:00:49.150> and<00:00:49.540> I<00:00:50.440> vibrate<00:00:50.980> my<00:00:51.129> wrist<00:00:51.340> really<00:00:51.610> fast

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
board and I vibrate my wrist really fast

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:58.680 
board and I vibrate my wrist really fast
so<00:00:52.390> I<00:00:52.420> started<00:00:52.989> out<00:00:53.079> just<00:00:53.260> going<00:00:57.329> now<00:00:58.329> my<00:00:58.480> pick

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
so I started out just going now my pick

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.060 
so I started out just going now my pick
isn't<00:00:58.930> moving<00:00:59.050> I'm<00:00:59.260> not<00:00:59.290> moving<00:00:59.410> my<00:00:59.650> pick<00:00:59.920> back

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
isn't moving I'm not moving my pick back

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.549 
isn't moving I'm not moving my pick back
and<00:01:00.250> forth<00:01:00.460> like<00:01:00.550> this<00:01:00.699> I'm<00:01:00.820> just<00:01:00.940> going<00:01:01.120> this

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
and forth like this I'm just going this

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.189 
and forth like this I'm just going this
slowly<00:01:02.559> moving<00:01:02.800> like<00:01:03.010> that<00:01:04.019> just<00:01:05.019> barely

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
slowly moving like that just barely

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.800 
slowly moving like that just barely
above<00:01:05.530> the<00:01:05.590> string

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
above the string

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.710 
above the string
and<00:01:08.350> what<00:01:09.070> I<00:01:09.100> started<00:01:09.280> doing<00:01:09.460> is<00:01:09.760> I<00:01:09.820> had<00:01:10.360> like

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
and what I started doing is I had like

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:18.960 
and what I started doing is I had like
the<00:01:10.810> 12<00:01:11.049> string<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:13.360> go<00:01:13.479> there<00:01:13.659> 11<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:18.820> can

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
the 12 string and go there 11 you can

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.060 
the 12 string and go there 11 you can
hear<00:01:19.150> the<00:01:19.299> chick<00:01:19.659> like<00:01:19.960> the<00:01:20.110> chicken<00:01:20.740> noise<00:01:20.890> of

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
hear the chick like the chicken noise of

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.480 
hear the chick like the chicken noise of
me<00:01:21.190> going<00:01:21.400> back<00:01:21.549> and<00:01:21.729> forth<00:01:23.310> now<00:01:24.310> what<00:01:24.460> I

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
me going back and forth now what I

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.100 
me going back and forth now what I
started<00:01:24.759> to<00:01:24.850> do<00:01:25.000> is<00:01:25.240> I<00:01:25.390> just<00:01:25.420> started<00:01:25.869> to<00:01:25.960> get

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
started to do is I just started to get

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.680 
started to do is I just started to get
better<00:01:26.320> at<00:01:26.590> holding<00:01:27.220> my<00:01:27.520> pain<00:01:27.820> positionally

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
better at holding my pain positionally

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.380 
better at holding my pain positionally
on<00:01:28.899> the<00:01:29.110> frets<00:01:29.350> better<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.729> I<00:01:30.880> was<00:01:31.119> able<00:01:31.240> to

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
on the frets better and I was able to

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.690 
on the frets better and I was able to
get<00:01:31.659> better<00:01:31.869> more<00:01:32.080> speed<00:01:32.440> so<00:01:32.470> I'm<00:01:32.860> so<00:01:33.250> not<00:01:33.430> slow

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
get better more speed so I'm so not slow

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.490 
get better more speed so I'm so not slow
so<00:01:33.940> first<00:01:34.149> when<00:01:34.299> I<00:01:34.360> started<00:01:34.690> learning<00:01:35.229> how<00:01:35.470> to

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
so first when I started learning how to

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.440 
so first when I started learning how to
do<00:01:35.680> this<00:01:35.830> I<00:01:35.950> would<00:01:36.070> start<00:01:36.310> out<00:01:36.369> just<00:01:39.450> that's

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
do this I would start out just that's

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.820 
do this I would start out just that's
you<00:01:40.660> know<00:01:40.780> pretty<00:01:41.110> time-consuming<00:01:41.320> and

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
you know pretty time-consuming and

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.139 
you know pretty time-consuming and
boring<00:01:42.039> but<00:01:42.190> it's<00:01:42.310> a<00:01:42.369> way<00:01:42.490> to<00:01:42.520> get<00:01:42.729> the<00:01:42.880> rhythm

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
boring but it's a way to get the rhythm

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.480 
boring but it's a way to get the rhythm
of<00:01:43.390> it<00:01:43.929> actually<00:01:44.259> down<00:01:44.470> and<00:01:44.950> get<00:01:45.130> your<00:01:45.220> finger

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
of it actually down and get your finger

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.370 
of it actually down and get your finger
positioning<00:01:45.880> like<00:01:46.060> I<00:01:46.149> said<00:01:46.360> I<00:01:46.390> barely<00:01:47.020> have

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
positioning like I said I barely have

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.240 
positioning like I said I barely have
the<00:01:47.500> tip<00:01:47.740> of<00:01:48.009> my<00:01:48.039> pick<00:01:48.490> shilling<00:01:48.850> when<00:01:48.940> I<00:01:49.000> do<00:01:49.060> it

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
the tip of my pick shilling when I do it

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.160 
the tip of my pick shilling when I do it
so<00:01:51.250> full<00:01:51.759> speed<00:01:52.119> I<00:01:52.330> can<00:01:52.569> if<00:01:52.780> I'm<00:01:52.899> on<00:01:53.050> the

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
so full speed I can if I'm on the

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.540 
so full speed I can if I'm on the
twelfth<00:01:53.470> strip<00:01:53.740> with<00:01:53.860> the<00:01:53.920> twelve<00:01:54.159> string<00:01:54.369> I

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
twelfth strip with the twelve string I

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.930 
twelfth strip with the twelve string I
start<00:01:54.789> out<00:01:54.819> slow<00:01:59.250> you<00:02:00.250> can<00:02:00.399> see<00:02:00.520> how<00:02:00.670> my<00:02:00.759> hands

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
start out slow you can see how my hands

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.249
