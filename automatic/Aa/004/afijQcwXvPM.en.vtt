00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
looked at the top to see where that was

00:00:52.469 --> 00:01:06.460 
looked at the top to see where that was
so<00:00:53.430> what<00:00:53.579> we're<00:00:53.699> gonna<00:00:53.760> do<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.350> cut

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.620 

and<00:01:07.610> we're<00:01:08.610> just<00:01:08.729> going<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.000> lift<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.330> wash
