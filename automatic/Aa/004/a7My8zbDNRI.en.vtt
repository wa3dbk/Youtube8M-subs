wasn't<00:01:41.280> very<00:01:41.580> big<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:43.140> went<00:01:43.530> on<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.740> do<00:01:43.920> some

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
wasn't very big and I went on to do some

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.399 
wasn't very big and I went on to do some
other<00:01:44.220> things<00:01:44.640> programming<00:01:45.450> things<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:46.259> know

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
other things programming things you know

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.039 
other things programming things you know
at<00:01:46.650> that<00:01:46.710> time<00:01:47.189> if<00:01:47.880> there<00:01:48.299> was<00:01:48.420> no<00:01:48.600> difficult

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
at that time if there was no difficult

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.420 
at that time if there was no difficult
part<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.470> you're<00:01:49.590> entering<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.040> industry

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
part of it you're entering the industry

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.920 
part of it you're entering the industry
except<00:01:50.729> doing<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.150> I<00:01:51.240> mean<00:01:51.270> coming<00:01:51.600> up<00:01:51.780> with

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
except doing it I mean coming up with

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.539 
except doing it I mean coming up with
the<00:01:52.020> money<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.350> buy<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.530> computer<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.340> was<00:01:53.520> a

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
the money to buy a computer that was a

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.730 
the money to buy a computer that was a
challenge<00:01:54.000> at<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.810> point<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.320> was<00:01:55.470> just<00:01:55.650> a

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
challenge at that point it was just a

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.380 
challenge at that point it was just a
miracle<00:01:55.979> if<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.280> got<00:01:56.430> anything<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.970> work<00:01:57.119> and

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
miracle if you got anything to work and

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.749 
miracle if you got anything to work and
so<00:01:57.990> anybody<00:01:58.350> could<00:01:58.619> write<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.829> game<00:01:59.070> all<00:01:59.520> it

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
so anybody could write a game all it

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.760 
so anybody could write a game all it
took<00:01:59.909> was<00:02:00.030> one<00:02:00.090> floppy<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.899> ship<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.229> on<00:02:01.350> you

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
took was one floppy to ship it on you

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.340 
took was one floppy to ship it on you
could<00:02:01.920> sell<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.130> yourself<00:02:02.280> if<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.700> wanted

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
could sell it yourself if you wanted

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.569 
could sell it yourself if you wanted
there<00:02:04.350> really<00:02:04.500> weren't<00:02:04.799> barriers<00:02:05.250> in<00:02:05.430> those

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
there really weren't barriers in those

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:06.030 
there really weren't barriers in those
days

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
days

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.710 
days
well<00:02:06.670> back<00:02:07.030> in<00:02:07.270> the<00:02:08.050> 70s<00:02:08.920> late<00:02:09.760> 70s<00:02:09.940> I<00:02:10.330> was<00:02:10.690> a

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
well back in the 70s late 70s I was a

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.660 
well back in the 70s late 70s I was a
graduate<00:02:11.440> student<00:02:11.470> at<00:02:11.920> Energy<00:02:12.340> Management

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
graduate student at Energy Management

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.420 
graduate student at Energy Management
and<00:02:12.910> policy<00:02:13.060> so<00:02:13.690> I<00:02:14.440> had<00:02:14.860> everything<00:02:15.100> but

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
and policy so I had everything but

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.700 
and policy so I had everything but
ridden<00:02:15.730> my<00:02:15.850> dissertation<00:02:16.180> and<00:02:16.870> then<00:02:17.260> I<00:02:17.290> had

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
ridden my dissertation and then I had

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.560 
ridden my dissertation and then I had
this<00:02:17.860> microcomputer<00:02:18.610> and<00:02:18.850> I<00:02:19.030> had<00:02:19.210> to<00:02:19.300> do<00:02:19.390> some

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
this microcomputer and I had to do some

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.630 
this microcomputer and I had to do some
stuff<00:02:19.780> on<00:02:19.960> it<00:02:20.020> for<00:02:20.410> work<00:02:20.650> them<00:02:20.920> it<00:02:21.280> was<00:02:21.430> way

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
stuff on it for work them it was way

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.130 
stuff on it for work them it was way
more<00:02:21.670> interesting<00:02:22.300> to<00:02:22.390> write<00:02:22.480> games<00:02:22.690> on<00:02:22.960> it

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
more interesting to write games on it

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.050 
more interesting to write games on it
than<00:02:23.260> it<00:02:23.350> was<00:02:23.500> to<00:02:23.650> finish<00:02:23.800> my<00:02:24.040> PhD<00:02:24.100> so<00:02:24.850> that's

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
than it was to finish my PhD so that's

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.450 
than it was to finish my PhD so that's
what<00:02:25.270> I<00:02:25.300> did<00:02:25.570> previously<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:26.770> first<00:02:26.800> class<00:02:27.280> I

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
what I did previously the first class I

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.570 
what I did previously the first class I
took<00:02:27.520> was<00:02:27.730> a<00:02:28.590> Fortran<00:02:29.590> for<00:02:29.920> geographers

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
took was a Fortran for geographers

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.710 
took was a Fortran for geographers
course<00:02:31.120> in<00:02:32.010> 1974<00:02:33.010> when<00:02:33.460> I<00:02:33.490> was<00:02:33.730> a<00:02:33.760> freshman

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
course in 1974 when I was a freshman

course in 1974 when I was a freshman
dick<00:02:35.560> Howard<00:02:35.860> had<00:02:36.070> a<00:02:36.100> class<00:02:36.490> and<00:02:36.820> it<00:02:36.910> was

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
dick Howard had a class and it was

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.060 
dick Howard had a class and it was
here's<00:02:37.780> how<00:02:37.900> you<00:02:37.960> program<00:02:38.200> in<00:02:38.440> Fortran<00:02:38.860> and

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
here's how you program in Fortran and

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.340 
here's how you program in Fortran and
every<00:02:39.280> day<00:02:39.460> every<00:02:39.700> class<00:02:40.300> I'd<00:02:40.570> come<00:02:40.780> in<00:02:40.960> and<00:02:41.110> he

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
every day every class I'd come in and he

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.630 
every day every class I'd come in and he
would<00:02:41.470> have<00:02:41.590> written<00:02:41.770> the<00:02:41.950> assignment<00:02:42.430> on<00:02:42.520> the

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
would have written the assignment on the

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.400 
would have written the assignment on the
board<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.090> then<00:02:43.360> he<00:02:43.510> talked<00:02:43.930> about<00:02:44.200> how<00:02:44.350> you

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
board and then he talked about how you

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.990 
board and then he talked about how you
would<00:02:44.620> do<00:02:44.740> the<00:02:44.890> assignment<00:02:45.340> but<00:02:45.700> I<00:02:45.730> would<00:02:45.880> look

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
would do the assignment but I would look

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.250 
would do the assignment but I would look
at<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.240> assignment<00:02:46.660> I'd<00:02:46.750> spend<00:02:46.990> the<00:02:47.020> class

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
at the assignment I'd spend the class

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.350 
at the assignment I'd spend the class
writing<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:47.890> code<00:02:48.130> out<00:02:48.160> in<00:02:48.550> on<00:02:48.760> paper<00:02:49.030> and

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
writing the code out in on paper and

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.670 
writing the code out in on paper and
then<00:02:49.480> I'd<00:02:49.600> run<00:02:49.750> over<00:02:50.050> and<00:02:50.230> I<00:02:50.290> typed<00:02:50.530> in<00:02:50.650> the

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
then I'd run over and I typed in the

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.100 
then I'd run over and I typed in the
program<00:02:51.130> and<00:02:51.340> it<00:02:51.670> would<00:02:52.120> work<00:02:52.300> I<00:02:52.570> never

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
program and it would work I never

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.600 
program and it would work I never
listened<00:02:53.590> to<00:02:53.620> what<00:02:53.800> he<00:02:53.830> was<00:02:54.040> actually<00:02:54.190> saying

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
listened to what he was actually saying

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.430 
listened to what he was actually saying
but<00:02:54.880> that<00:02:54.910> was<00:02:55.150> a<00:02:55.210> lot<00:02:55.360> of<00:02:55.390> fun<00:02:55.600> and<00:02:55.780> then<00:02:56.110> I

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
but that was a lot of fun and then I

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.910 
but that was a lot of fun and then I
took<00:02:56.770> an<00:02:56.950> assembly<00:02:57.400> class<00:02:57.640> that<00:02:58.090> summer<00:02:58.420> and

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
took an assembly class that summer and

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.900 
took an assembly class that summer and
suddenly<00:02:59.920> there<00:03:00.130> was<00:03:00.190> I<00:03:00.340> remember<00:03:00.400> there<00:03:00.850> was

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
suddenly there was I remember there was

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.400 
suddenly there was I remember there was
a<00:03:00.970> point<00:03:01.180> at<00:03:01.270> which<00:03:01.360> I<00:03:01.510> realized<00:03:01.690> that<00:03:02.080> this

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
a point at which I realized that this

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.230 
a point at which I realized that this
wasn't<00:03:02.770> another<00:03:02.980> language<00:03:03.490> this<00:03:03.790> was<00:03:04.000> how<00:03:04.180> the

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
wasn't another language this was how the

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.880 
wasn't another language this was how the
computer<00:03:04.840> work<00:03:04.990> and<00:03:05.350> that<00:03:05.500> was<00:03:05.650> quite<00:03:05.860> a

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
computer work and that was quite a

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.400 
computer work and that was quite a
revelation<00:03:06.100> all<00:03:06.640> the<00:03:06.880> skills<00:03:07.150> I<00:03:07.270> had<00:03:07.450> ten

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
revelation all the skills I had ten

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.380 
revelation all the skills I had ten
years<00:03:08.620> ago<00:03:08.800> even<00:03:08.950> let<00:03:09.190> alone<00:03:09.340> 30<00:03:09.640> they're

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
years ago even let alone 30 they're

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.820 
years ago even let alone 30 they're
really<00:03:10.630> not<00:03:10.780> useful<00:03:11.020> except<00:03:11.470> for<00:03:11.650> how<00:03:11.770> to

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
really not useful except for how to

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.190 
really not useful except for how to
analyze<00:03:12.250> problems<00:03:12.520> I<00:03:12.910> mean<00:03:13.090> in<00:03:13.300> this<00:03:13.660> industry

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
analyze problems I mean in this industry

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.960 
analyze problems I mean in this industry
it's<00:03:14.500> like<00:03:14.770> a<00:03:14.800> shark<00:03:15.130> you<00:03:15.250> just<00:03:15.490> keep<00:03:15.640> moving

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
it's like a shark you just keep moving

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.400 
it's like a shark you just keep moving
and<00:03:16.090> so<00:03:16.510> you<00:03:16.570> really<00:03:16.959> do<00:03:17.080> have<00:03:17.200> to<00:03:17.290> keep

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
and so you really do have to keep

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.660 
and so you really do have to keep
teaching<00:03:17.770> yourself<00:03:17.830> new<00:03:18.250> things

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
teaching yourself new things

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.520 
teaching yourself new things
until<00:03:19.270> recently<00:03:19.930> I<00:03:20.020> would<00:03:20.230> have<00:03:20.320> said<00:03:20.500> that

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
until recently I would have said that

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.620 
until recently I would have said that
the<00:03:20.709> most<00:03:21.010> difficult<00:03:21.700> and<00:03:21.850> challenging<00:03:21.910> and

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
the most difficult and challenging and

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.210 
the most difficult and challenging and
interesting<00:03:22.900> one<00:03:23.290> was<00:03:23.410> quite<00:03:23.680> because<00:03:24.040> so

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
interesting one was quite because so

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.470 
interesting one was quite because so
many<00:03:24.310> different<00:03:24.700> things<00:03:24.790> had<00:03:25.000> to<00:03:25.090> be<00:03:25.180> solved

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
many different things had to be solved

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.080 
many different things had to be solved
simultaneously<00:03:25.510> six<00:03:26.380> degree<00:03:26.650> of<00:03:26.680> freedom<00:03:27.090> 3d

yet<00:03:32.560> I<00:03:32.709> mean<00:03:32.830> heck<00:03:33.040> mouselook<00:03:33.610> got<00:03:33.820> invented

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120

for<00:03:34.450> Quake<00:03:34.630> nobody<00:03:35.080> really<00:03:35.440> knew<00:03:35.590> about<00:03:35.620> any

for Quake nobody really knew about any
of<00:03:36.160> this<00:03:36.280> so<00:03:36.910> that<00:03:37.090> was<00:03:37.270> definitely

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
of this so that was definitely

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.330 
of this so that was definitely
challenging<00:03:38.620> and<00:03:38.770> fascinating<00:03:38.860> but<00:03:39.220> now<00:03:39.310> I

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
challenging and fascinating but now I

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.130 
challenging and fascinating but now I
would<00:03:39.489> absolutely<00:03:39.940> say<00:03:40.330> virtual<00:03:40.720> reality

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
would absolutely say virtual reality

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.630 
would absolutely say virtual reality
it's<00:03:41.290> solvable<00:03:41.709> but<00:03:42.040> there<00:03:42.220> are<00:03:42.280> all<00:03:42.459> these

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
it's solvable but there are all these

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.040 
it's solvable but there are all these
different<00:03:42.790> aspects<00:03:43.360> on<00:03:43.540> it<00:03:43.660> that<00:03:43.780> need<00:03:43.930> to<00:03:44.020> be

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
different aspects on it that need to be

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.840 
different aspects on it that need to be
solved<00:03:44.500> how<00:03:44.709> do<00:03:44.770> you<00:03:44.920> track<00:03:45.190> head<00:03:45.400> position

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
solved how do you track head position

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.090 
solved how do you track head position
and<00:03:46.000> orientation<00:03:46.450> how<00:03:47.200> do<00:03:47.260> you<00:03:47.530> draw<00:03:48.040> the

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
and orientation how do you draw the

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.490 
and orientation how do you draw the
stuff<00:03:48.430> so<00:03:48.640> that<00:03:48.910> it<00:03:49.090> doesn't<00:03:49.840> smear<00:03:50.230> and<00:03:50.380> it

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
stuff so that it doesn't smear and it

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.470 
stuff so that it doesn't smear and it
doesn't<00:03:50.770> strop<00:03:51.040> it's<00:03:51.489> quite<00:03:52.180> a<00:03:52.209> fascinating

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
doesn't strop it's quite a fascinating

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.560 
doesn't strop it's quite a fascinating
problem<00:03:53.170> so<00:03:53.739> what's<00:03:54.130> a<00:03:54.250> course<00:03:54.550> or<00:03:54.880> class<00:03:55.150> that

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
problem so what's a course or class that

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:56.699 
problem so what's a course or class that
you<00:03:55.660> recommend<00:03:56.110> for<00:03:56.260> somebody<00:03:56.440> who's

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
you recommend for somebody who's

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.890 
you recommend for somebody who's

interested in being engineer in the

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
gaming industry that I wish I knew but

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.910 
gaming industry that I wish I knew but
of<00:04:01.420> course<00:04:01.630> since<00:04:01.810> I<00:04:01.989> came<00:04:02.230> into<00:04:02.410> it<00:04:02.530> so<00:04:02.739> long

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
of course since I came into it so long

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.229 
of course since I came into it so long
ago<00:04:02.980> I<00:04:03.220> wouldn't<00:04:03.580> know<00:04:03.700> the<00:04:03.820> one<00:04:03.970> thing<00:04:04.120> I

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
ago I wouldn't know the one thing I

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:05.880 
ago I wouldn't know the one thing I
would<00:04:04.450> say<00:04:04.660> is<00:04:04.810> that<00:04:04.840> it's<00:04:05.140> useful<00:04:05.320> to<00:04:05.680> learn

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
would say is that it's useful to learn

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.479 
would say is that it's useful to learn
things<00:04:06.520> other<00:04:06.910> than<00:04:07.209> how<00:04:07.360> to<00:04:07.420> program

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
things other than how to program

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.040 
things other than how to program
programming<00:04:09.489> for<00:04:10.090> people<00:04:10.390> who<00:04:10.450> really<00:04:10.630> belong

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
programming for people who really belong

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.390 
programming for people who really belong
in<00:04:11.200> this<00:04:11.290> industry<00:04:11.680> in<00:04:11.739> my<00:04:11.890> opinion<00:04:12.220> is<00:04:12.370> just

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
in this industry in my opinion is just

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.789 
in this industry in my opinion is just
not<00:04:12.790> that<00:04:12.820> hard<00:04:13.330> I<00:04:13.570> mean<00:04:13.840> I<00:04:13.959> largely

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
not that hard I mean I largely

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.640 
not that hard I mean I largely
self-taught<00:04:15.310> myself<00:04:15.790> at<00:04:16.000> that<00:04:16.030> time

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
self-taught myself at that time

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.729 
self-taught myself at that time
and<00:04:17.209> what<00:04:18.209> is<00:04:18.329> hard<00:04:18.600> though<00:04:18.810> is<00:04:19.049> knowing<00:04:19.620> how

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
and what is hard though is knowing how

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.069 
and what is hard though is knowing how
matrix<00:04:20.190> math<00:04:20.370> works<00:04:20.699> well<00:04:20.940> knowing<00:04:21.359> how<00:04:21.510> to<00:04:21.570> do

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
matrix math works well knowing how to do

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.320 
matrix math works well knowing how to do
things<00:04:22.260> like<00:04:22.470> solvers<00:04:22.979> and<00:04:23.010> image<00:04:23.850> processing

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
things like solvers and image processing

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.840 
things like solvers and image processing
and<00:04:24.510> such<00:04:24.690> having<00:04:25.410> some<00:04:25.680> hard<00:04:26.100> deep<00:04:26.370> knowledge

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
and such having some hard deep knowledge

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.100 
and such having some hard deep knowledge
to<00:04:27.000> go<00:04:27.150> with<00:04:27.330> your<00:04:27.419> programming<00:04:27.810> skills

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
to go with your programming skills

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.570 
to go with your programming skills
that's<00:04:28.440> really<00:04:28.830> valuable<00:04:29.160> because<00:04:29.340> there<00:04:29.520> are

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
that's really valuable because there are

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.920 
that's really valuable because there are
a<00:04:29.610> lot<00:04:29.699> of<00:04:29.729> problems<00:04:29.940> you<00:04:30.150> can't<00:04:30.360> tackle<00:04:30.600> any

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
a lot of problems you can't tackle any

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.810 
a lot of problems you can't tackle any
other<00:04:31.050> way<00:04:31.290> the<00:04:31.949> one<00:04:32.100> thing<00:04:32.250> I<00:04:32.340> would<00:04:32.400> say<00:04:32.669> is

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
other way the one thing I would say is

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.189 
other way the one thing I would say is
that<00:04:32.970> a<00:04:33.000> lot<00:04:33.180> of<00:04:33.270> times<00:04:33.540> now<00:04:33.720> people<00:04:34.050> get

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
that a lot of times now people get

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:35.510 
that a lot of times now people get
taught<00:04:34.410> programming<00:04:34.949> in<00:04:35.040> a<00:04:35.100> very<00:04:35.310> abstract

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
taught programming in a very abstract

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.210 
taught programming in a very abstract
level<00:04:36.180> and<00:04:36.300> that's<00:04:36.449> great<00:04:36.840> for<00:04:37.010> doing<00:04:38.010> big

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
level and that's great for doing big

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.020 
level and that's great for doing big
projects<00:04:39.979> building<00:04:40.979> things<00:04:41.220> in<00:04:41.370> modular<00:04:41.820> ways

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
projects building things in modular ways

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.700 
projects building things in modular ways
so<00:04:42.240> they<00:04:42.330> can<00:04:42.479> be<00:04:42.600> maintained<00:04:43.050> and<00:04:43.260> so<00:04:43.380> forth

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
so they can be maintained and so forth

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.770 
so they can be maintained and so forth
but<00:04:44.010> it<00:04:44.310> takes<00:04:44.580> you<00:04:44.760> farther<00:04:45.030> away<00:04:45.240> from<00:04:45.570> how

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
but it takes you farther away from how

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.140 
but it takes you farther away from how
programs<00:04:46.350> actually<00:04:47.010> work<00:04:47.250> when<00:04:47.490> they<00:04:47.639> run<00:04:47.880> and

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
programs actually work when they run and

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.000 
programs actually work when they run and
the<00:04:48.690> key<00:04:48.840> to<00:04:48.960> performance<00:04:49.560> which<00:04:49.710> is<00:04:49.860> my

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
the key to performance which is my

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.379 
the key to performance which is my
favorite<00:04:50.370> part<00:04:50.520> programming<00:04:51.150> is<00:04:51.240> how

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
favorite part programming is how

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.810 
favorite part programming is how
programs<00:04:51.930> interact<00:04:52.830> with<00:04:53.160> the<00:04:53.370> hardware<00:04:53.760> and

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
programs interact with the hardware and

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.000 
programs interact with the hardware and
in<00:04:54.090> order<00:04:54.690> to<00:04:54.720> do<00:04:54.990> some<00:04:55.260> things<00:04:55.560> you<00:04:55.710> really

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
in order to do some things you really

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.070 
in order to do some things you really
have<00:04:56.160> to<00:04:56.310> understand<00:04:56.789> that<00:04:56.910> now<00:04:57.510> that's<00:04:57.810> more

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
have to understand that now that's more

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.110 
have to understand that now that's more
true<00:04:58.350> now<00:04:58.380> than<00:04:58.590> it<00:04:58.919> ever<00:04:59.070> has<00:04:59.370> been<00:04:59.610> for<00:04:59.970> what

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
true now than it ever has been for what

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.820 
true now than it ever has been for what
I'm<00:05:00.240> working<00:05:00.570> on<00:05:00.630> because<00:05:00.840> in<00:05:01.020> VR<00:05:01.320> if<00:05:01.680> the

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
I'm working on because in VR if the

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.320 
I'm working on because in VR if the
hardware<00:05:02.039> doesn't<00:05:02.460> work<00:05:02.580> perfectly<00:05:02.820> with<00:05:03.210> the

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
hardware doesn't work perfectly with the

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.029 
hardware doesn't work perfectly with the
software<00:05:03.690> you<00:05:03.990> don't<00:05:04.199> have<00:05:04.440> an<00:05:04.560> experience

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
software you don't have an experience

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:07.040 
software you don't have an experience
that<00:05:05.160> you<00:05:05.280> want<00:05:05.430> to<00:05:05.610> have<00:05:05.729> and<00:05:06.000> so<00:05:06.240> it<00:05:06.810> turns

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
that you want to have and so it turns

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.450 
that you want to have and so it turns

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
out that there are specific things you

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.610 
out that there are specific things you

just couldn't have existed you have to

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.920 
just couldn't have existed you have to
make<00:05:32.340> the<00:05:32.490> hardware<00:05:32.789> exist<00:05:33.210> to<00:05:33.389> have<00:05:33.510> certain

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
things the way it works at valve is if

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.020 
things the way it works at valve is if
you<00:05:37.289> think<00:05:37.530> there's<00:05:37.740> something<00:05:37.820> that<00:05:38.820> is<00:05:39.000> a

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
you think there's something that is a

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.150 
you think there's something that is a
really<00:05:39.360> valuable<00:05:39.539> thing<00:05:39.900> to<00:05:39.930> do<00:05:40.139> you<00:05:40.950> should

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
really valuable thing to do you should

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.560 
really valuable thing to do you should
go<00:05:41.310> and<00:05:41.460> do<00:05:41.669> it<00:05:41.820> and<00:05:42.030> see<00:05:42.150> if<00:05:42.240> you<00:05:42.330> can<00:05:42.450> get

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
go and do it and see if you can get

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:43.820 
go and do it and see if you can get
other<00:05:42.720> people<00:05:42.810> to<00:05:43.169> do<00:05:43.289> it<00:05:43.320> with<00:05:43.440> you<00:05:43.740> and

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
other people to do it with you and

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.439 
other people to do it with you and
that's<00:05:44.010> what<00:05:44.160> I<00:05:44.190> did<00:05:44.430> with<00:05:44.550> virtual<00:05:44.940> reality

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:45.449 
that's what I did with virtual reality

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:49.879 
that's what I did with virtual reality
and<00:05:46.760> it<00:05:47.760> wasn't<00:05:48.000> going<00:05:48.419> as<00:05:49.020> my<00:05:49.320> previous<00:05:49.710> jobs

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:49.889 
and it wasn't going as my previous jobs

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:51.469 
and it wasn't going as my previous jobs
it<00:05:49.979> wasn't<00:05:50.190> convincing<00:05:50.550> my<00:05:50.699> manager<00:05:51.150> or<00:05:51.300> up

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 
it wasn't convincing my manager or up

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:53.150 
it wasn't convincing my manager or up
the<00:05:51.630> chain<00:05:51.870> that<00:05:52.080> something<00:05:52.410> was<00:05:52.530> worth<00:05:52.740> doing

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 
the chain that something was worth doing

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.830 
the chain that something was worth doing
it<00:05:53.340> wasn't<00:05:53.699> having<00:05:54.060> someone<00:05:54.360> tell<00:05:54.539> me<00:05:54.570> what

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
it wasn't having someone tell me what

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.870 
it wasn't having someone tell me what
was<00:05:54.960> worth<00:05:55.110> doing<00:05:55.440> it<00:05:55.530> was<00:05:55.650> me<00:05:56.220> thinking<00:05:56.460> about

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
was worth doing it was me thinking about

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.850 
was worth doing it was me thinking about
it<00:05:57.060> doing<00:05:57.300> experiments<00:05:57.960> saying<00:05:58.410> let's<00:05:58.620> try

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
it doing experiments saying let's try

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.589 
it doing experiments saying let's try
this<00:05:58.919> seeing<00:05:59.639> if<00:05:59.729> other<00:05:59.880> people<00:06:00.270> thought<00:06:00.510> it

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:00.599 
this seeing if other people thought it

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:03.050 
this seeing if other people thought it
made<00:06:00.750> sense<00:06:00.979> heading<00:06:01.979> down<00:06:02.130> that<00:06:02.160> road<00:06:02.580> so<00:06:02.880> it

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
made sense heading down that road so it

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.659 
made sense heading down that road so it
really<00:06:03.270> is<00:06:03.449> a<00:06:03.479> very<00:06:03.720> organic<00:06:03.900> process<00:06:04.669> in

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:05.669 
really is a very organic process in

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:06.589 
really is a very organic process in
which<00:06:05.820> there's<00:06:06.000> a<00:06:06.090> huge<00:06:06.300> amount<00:06:06.539> of

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:06.599 
which there's a huge amount of

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:09.380 
which there's a huge amount of
individual<00:06:07.229> responsibility
