this one

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.550 
this one
make<00:01:10.940> sure<00:01:11.240> there's<00:01:11.510> a<00:01:11.570> safe<00:01:11.900> backdrop

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
make sure there's a safe backdrop

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.200

because<00:01:12.740> those<00:01:13.100> arrows<00:01:13.520> if<00:01:13.730> you're<00:01:13.880> dilute

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
because those arrows if you're dilute

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.660 
because those arrows if you're dilute
breaks<00:01:14.540> or<00:01:14.780> you<00:01:14.900> snap<00:01:15.320> a<00:01:15.350> shot<00:01:15.680> they<00:01:16.370> could<00:01:16.550> go

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
breaks or you snap a shot they could go

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.130 
breaks or you snap a shot they could go
through<00:01:16.909> drywall<00:01:17.390> so<00:01:17.600> make<00:01:17.780> sure<00:01:17.810> there's

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
through drywall so make sure there's

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
gonna have to think about those things

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.550 
gonna have to think about those things
when<00:02:49.790> things<00:02:50.030> get<00:02:50.180> intense<00:02:50.600> there<00:02:51.230> can<00:02:51.440> be<00:02:51.470> a

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
lot of pressure in real scenarios so

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.360 
lot of pressure in real scenarios so
it's<00:02:53.780> good<00:02:54.019> to<00:02:54.170> have<00:02:54.290> all<00:02:54.350> these<00:02:54.799> things<00:02:55.040> taken

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
it's good to have all these things taken

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.780 
it's good to have all these things taken
care<00:02:55.400> of
