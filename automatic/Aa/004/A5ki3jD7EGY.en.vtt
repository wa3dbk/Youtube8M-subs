00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.320 
did and basically what we're going to do
here<00:00:10.380> is<00:00:11.269> hook<00:00:12.269> this<00:00:12.450> up<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:14.030> our<00:00:15.030> test

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
here is hook this up to the our test

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.779 
here is hook this up to the our test
power<00:00:15.570> supply<00:00:15.929> here<00:00:16.170> that<00:00:16.949> has<00:00:17.100> been<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.340> jump

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
power supply here that has been a jump

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.800 
power supply here that has been a jump
started<00:00:18.529> the<00:00:19.529> green<00:00:19.770> in<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:19.980> black<00:00:20.220> wire<00:00:20.810> and

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
started the green in the black wire and

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.080 
started the green in the black wire and
then<00:00:22.769> i'm<00:00:22.859> going<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.010> hook<00:00:23.100> this<00:00:23.279> fan<00:00:23.550> up<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.910> it

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
then i'm going to hook this fan up to it

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.349 
then i'm going to hook this fan up to it
and<00:00:24.800> basically<00:00:25.800> make<00:00:26.160> sure<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.699> i<00:00:26.970> did

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
and basically make sure that i did

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.179 
and basically make sure that i did
everything<00:00:27.779> right<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.710> my<00:00:28.949> fan

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
everything right and that my fan

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.299 
everything right and that my fan
controller<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.390> stuff<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.320> first<00:00:32.189> thing

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
controller is that stuff so first thing

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.380 
controller is that stuff so first thing
we<00:00:32.369> want<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.550> do<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.759> plug<00:00:32.969> in<00:00:33.120> your<00:00:33.210> power

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
the power supply so here I have this

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.180 
the power supply so here I have this
little<00:00:39.149> ID<00:00:39.510> hard<00:00:39.870> drive<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.590> CD<00:00:40.920> drive
