what<00:00:17.990> are<00:00:18.109> these<00:00:18.230> things<00:00:18.500> on<00:00:18.800> the<00:00:18.949> edges

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340 
what are these things on the edges

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.099 
what are these things on the edges
they're<00:00:19.490> kind<00:00:19.670> of<00:00:19.699> like<00:00:19.820> ridges<00:00:20.359> yeah

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:21.109 
they're kind of like ridges yeah

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.759 
they're kind of like ridges yeah

machines<00:00:27.619> one<00:00:28.039> now<00:00:28.820> I<00:00:28.849> have<00:00:29.149> two<00:00:29.390> gears<00:00:29.689> here

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
machines one now I have two gears here

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.710 
machines one now I have two gears here
what<00:00:30.829> can<00:00:31.009> I<00:00:31.130> do<00:00:31.189> with<00:00:31.520> that<00:00:31.759> students<00:00:32.540> learn

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:32.720 
what can I do with that students learn

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.390 
what can I do with that students learn
the<00:00:32.750> basics<00:00:33.500> of<00:00:33.650> science<00:00:34.100> technology

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.400 
the basics of science technology

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.479 
the basics of science technology
engineering<00:00:35.120> and<00:00:35.809> math<00:00:36.140> just<00:00:36.589> put<00:00:36.890> two<00:00:37.129> gears

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
engineering and math just put two gears

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.910 
engineering and math just put two gears
and<00:00:37.940> then<00:00:40.420> it's<00:00:41.420> stem<00:00:41.839> learning<00:00:42.379> closely

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
and then it's stem learning closely

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.310 
and then it's stem learning closely
aligned<00:00:43.280> with<00:00:43.460> state<00:00:43.879> standards<00:00:44.120> for<00:00:44.809> primary

grade<00:00:45.589> students<00:00:46.190> the<00:00:46.519> kids<00:00:46.699> just<00:00:47.059> finished<00:00:47.629> my

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
grade students the kids just finished my

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.049 
grade students the kids just finished my
unit<00:00:48.500> on<00:00:48.650> simple<00:00:49.010> machines<00:00:49.370> so<00:00:49.640> it<00:00:49.730> gives<00:00:49.910> them

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
unit on simple machines so it gives them

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.979 
unit on simple machines so it gives them
an<00:00:50.210> opportunity<00:00:50.420> to<00:00:50.870> actually<00:00:51.440> come<00:00:51.680> in<00:00:51.829> and

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
an opportunity to actually come in and

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.959 
an opportunity to actually come in and
see<00:00:56.590> the<00:00:57.590> excitement<00:00:58.010> we'll<00:00:58.370> build<00:00:58.670> as

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
to make their model go faster you notice

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:06.910 
to make their model go faster you notice
that<00:01:05.960> they're<00:01:06.170> both<00:01:06.320> going<00:01:06.590> to<00:01:06.619> different

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
that they're both going to different

in<00:01:33.260> real<00:01:33.440> life<00:01:33.740> I<00:01:35.020> think<00:01:36.020> it's<00:01:36.110> a<00:01:36.230> reward<00:01:36.590> for

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
in real life I think it's a reward for

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.830 
in real life I think it's a reward for
them<00:01:37.010> for<00:01:37.490> all<00:01:37.790> of<00:01:37.820> their<00:01:38.090> hard<00:01:38.240> work<00:01:38.480> to<00:01:38.750> get

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840
