00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 plan good night the 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.930
 press conference from the technician of the 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.670
 Ecuadorean selection reinaldo rueda se 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.040
 he has just formulated a couple of 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.599
 questions let's listen to the questions 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.130
 that come forward that are 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.650
 basically from the Ecuadorian press 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.869
 let's listen to the selection of 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.760
 Argentina and Díaz Martín can not count 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.949
 to ecuador with christian benítez we have 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.560
 problems with felipe caicedo player who 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.810
 is not 100% what analysis are you there 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.550
 how to turn the page no longer 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.710
 think about what was the result of the day of 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.730
 today but immediately project on what 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.130
 what will be the commitment against Argentina 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.240
 because Ecuador despite defeats has 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.790
 great possibilities still 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.800
 and I think this is the job not to give 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.300
 back to the page we already started some 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.350
 minutes with Carlos players with all the 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.340
 group assimilate this result know that 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.650
 you have to recover as soon as 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.470
 possible and that we're going to have another rival 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.850
 difficult to the front I think the group 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.560
 here he has understood the group is very 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.270
 conscious with a clear conscience 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.070
 of all the delivery that each 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.640
 one of the players there is no 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.890
 reproach which was offered and good today 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.210
 It was up to him to win Peru and that is the 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.620
 football you have to follow and raise the 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.010
 head and know that the Mars well other 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:14.290
 game the colleague reinaldo melo sorry what 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.660
 of benitez is a shame it is not a 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.250
 yellow that is even from me from my 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.220
 point of view I consider it a bit 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.590
 precipitated by the judge because it is 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.500
 a foul on benitez he reacts and 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.760
 well I think it does not have that yellow 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.760
 I think you should have avoided 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.649
 rosalba in the night gave the impression 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.479
 that in certain passages of the second 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.479
 time the team will enter a kind of 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.909
 anxiety to arrive and anxiety I do not know 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.530
 if it fell a bit of disorder in all the 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.409
 organism finally raised ecuador 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.579
 but like that despair does not 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.140
 gave clarity in the final line professor 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:54.659
 well I think the game opened on 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.140
 party opened they see that when 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.750
 enter felipe we ran a lot of risk 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.280
 because there were several situations that for 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.289
 lack of pace so he comes 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.659
 going through balls that caught us 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:09.179
 coming out but it was what had to be 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.950
 bet not to place a daily name 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.709
 some minutes that I can not do 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.209
 damage preparing what comes to us and 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.920
 know that the party was becoming 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.000
 risking a lot because we have to 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.049
 overtake the lines and well I think that 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.930
 out there you can interpret it as 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:27.329
 anxiety a little bit precipitated were 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.940
 very fast actions but in the end I think 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:33.510
 that Ecuador made a great proposal 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.970
 colleague ana guzmán let's cut 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.439
 make a commercial break let's do 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.480
 a commercial break and we go back to 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:42.530
 have the time of the conference 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.530
