00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
you see the individual mounts I kind of

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.569 
you see the individual mounts I kind of
ran<00:02:17.019> out<00:02:17.049> of<00:02:17.170> bolts<00:02:17.530> so<00:02:17.650> I<00:02:17.680> used<00:02:17.890> these<00:02:18.130> longer

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:18.579 
ran out of bolts so I used these longer

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.000 
ran out of bolts so I used these longer
bolts<00:02:18.940> so<00:02:19.390> when<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:19.870> pressure<00:02:20.079> comes<00:02:20.200> down<00:02:20.680> or

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
bolts so when the pressure comes down or

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.800 
bolts so when the pressure comes down or
monitor<00:02:21.850> comes<00:02:22.000> down<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.329> pressure<00:02:22.540> doesn't

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
monitor comes down the pressure doesn't

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.660 
monitor comes down the pressure doesn't
snap<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.410> wood<00:02:23.590> so<00:02:24.100> I<00:02:24.160> used<00:02:24.340> some<00:02:24.370> little

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
snap the wood so I used some little

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.449 
snap the wood so I used some little
longer<00:02:24.940> bolts<00:02:25.239> for<00:02:25.420> that<00:02:26.100> force<00:02:27.100> on<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.340> back

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
longer bolts for that force on the back

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.490 
longer bolts for that force on the back

you'll<00:02:46.900> see<00:02:47.049> HDMI<00:02:47.860> in<00:02:48.069> so<00:02:48.580> I<00:02:48.610> can<00:02:48.760> do<00:02:49.000> my

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
you'll see HDMI in so I can do my

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.479 
you'll see HDMI in so I can do my
computer<00:02:49.900> straight<00:02:50.170> into<00:02:50.470> this<00:02:50.650> but<00:02:51.250> instead

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
computer straight into this but instead

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.850 
computer straight into this but instead
I<00:02:51.549> chose<00:02:51.879> to<00:02:52.150> use<00:02:52.299> this<00:02:52.599> for<00:02:53.079> the<00:02:53.290> video<00:02:53.560> card

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
I chose to use this for the video card

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.789 
I chose to use this for the video card
because<00:02:54.579> it<00:02:54.790> does<00:02:55.150> analog<00:02:55.810> video<00:02:56.019> in<00:02:56.319> really

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
because it does analog video in really

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.369 
because it does analog video in really
nicely<00:02:57.010> here<00:02:57.549> is<00:02:58.030> an<00:02:58.180> older<00:02:58.690> card<00:02:59.019> which<00:02:59.260> is

00:02:59.369 --> 00:02:59.379 
nicely here is an older card which is

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.199 
nicely here is an older card which is
eventually<00:02:59.530> gonna<00:02:59.769> get<00:03:00.010> swapped<00:03:00.400> out<00:03:00.670> this

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
eventually gonna get swapped out this

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.680 
eventually gonna get swapped out this
older<00:03:01.659> card<00:03:01.930> only<00:03:02.319> does<00:03:02.470> 640<00:03:03.069> by<00:03:03.190> 480<00:03:03.730> so<00:03:04.299> we

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
older card only does 640 by 480 so we

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.660 
older card only does 640 by 480 so we
have<00:03:05.110> it<00:03:05.290> to<00:03:05.590> this<00:03:05.709> little<00:03:05.980> device<00:03:06.099> this<00:03:06.489> is<00:03:06.549> a

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
have it to this little device this is a

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.869 
have it to this little device this is a
VGA<00:03:07.150> in<00:03:07.599> to<00:03:08.379> composite<00:03:08.950> out<00:03:09.340> and<00:03:09.700> this

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
VGA in to composite out and this

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.759 
VGA in to composite out and this
basically<00:03:10.269> allows<00:03:10.420> my<00:03:10.810> music<00:03:11.140> videos<00:03:11.440> to<00:03:11.680> go

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
basically allows my music videos to go

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:14.069 
basically allows my music videos to go
directly<00:03:12.190> here<00:03:12.549> and<00:03:12.700> coming<00:03:13.180> out<00:03:13.329> there<00:03:13.599> of

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
directly here and coming out there of

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.640 
directly here and coming out there of
course<00:03:14.319> is<00:03:14.530> not<00:03:14.709> HD<00:03:14.920> by<00:03:15.670> one<00:03:15.849> HD<00:03:16.299> I<00:03:16.599> just<00:03:17.470> go

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
course is not HD by one HD I just go

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.000 
course is not HD by one HD I just go
HDMI<00:03:18.579> in<00:03:18.849> and<00:03:19.180> then<00:03:19.659> I<00:03:19.690> do<00:03:19.810> my<00:03:20.109> live<00:03:20.379> video<00:03:20.680> in

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
HDMI in and then I do my live video in

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.729 
HDMI in and then I do my live video in
through<00:03:21.579> this<00:03:21.700> card<00:03:22.230> eventually<00:03:23.230> will<00:03:23.440> add<00:03:23.709> a

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
through this card eventually will add a

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.949 
through this card eventually will add a
second<00:03:24.159> black<00:03:24.310> magic<00:03:24.730> card<00:03:24.970> but<00:03:25.180> again<00:03:25.450> just

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
second black magic card but again just

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.619 
second black magic card but again just
basic<00:03:26.650> building<00:03:26.980> it<00:03:27.370> works<00:03:27.670> great<00:03:27.940> for<00:03:27.970> me<00:03:28.239> and

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:28.629 
basic building it works great for me and

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:30.960 
basic building it works great for me and
this<00:03:29.349> is<00:03:29.470> of<00:03:29.590> course<00:03:29.829> again<00:03:30.040> very<00:03:30.400> cheap<00:03:30.790> but

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
this is of course again very cheap but

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.819 
this is of course again very cheap but
it<00:03:31.060> works<00:03:31.239> great<00:03:31.659> DJing<00:03:32.290> best<00:03:33.040> video<00:03:33.430> or

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
it works great DJing best video or

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.559 
it works great DJing best video or
composite<00:03:35.829> out<00:03:35.980> again<00:03:36.519> I<00:03:36.700> chose<00:03:37.030> composite

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
composite out again I chose composite

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.289

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
really cool features where you can map

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:07.979 
really cool features where you can map
different<00:04:06.699> things<00:04:07.090> to<00:04:07.209> different<00:04:07.329> projectors

again all that later is coming on total
built<00:04:11.349> on<00:04:11.530> didn't<00:04:11.799> take<00:04:11.919> that<00:04:12.040> long<00:04:12.250> you'll

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
built on didn't take that long you'll

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.119 
built on didn't take that long you'll
also<00:04:12.669> notice<00:04:13.090> that<00:04:13.239> I<00:04:13.419> took<00:04:13.989> a<00:04:14.049> shelf<00:04:14.470> here<00:04:14.769> and

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:15.129 
also notice that I took a shelf here and

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:17.370 
also notice that I took a shelf here and
I<00:04:15.190> put<00:04:15.370> it<00:04:15.489> upside<00:04:15.790> down<00:04:15.819> and<00:04:16.299> as<00:04:16.750> they<00:04:16.870> sit<00:04:17.169> you

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
I put it upside down and as they sit you

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.199 
I put it upside down and as they sit you
know<00:04:17.410> yes<00:04:17.799> this<00:04:17.949> is<00:04:18.130> leaning<00:04:18.489> slightly<00:04:18.669> a<00:04:18.940> bit

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
know yes this is leaning slightly a bit

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.879 
know yes this is leaning slightly a bit
but<00:04:19.840> it<00:04:20.049> means<00:04:20.229> that<00:04:20.410> the<00:04:20.500> wrists<00:04:20.739> aren't

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
but it means that the wrists aren't

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:22.710 
but it means that the wrists aren't
gonna<00:04:21.039> be<00:04:21.190> hurt<00:04:21.459> from<00:04:21.760> having<00:04:22.030> to<00:04:22.120> go<00:04:22.240> up<00:04:22.449> like

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
gonna be hurt from having to go up like

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.189 
gonna be hurt from having to go up like
that<00:04:23.020> it's<00:04:23.650> just<00:04:23.800> easy<00:04:24.190> comfortable<00:04:25.020> etc<00:04:26.020> this

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:26.199 
that it's just easy comfortable etc this

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:27.719 
that it's just easy comfortable etc this
is<00:04:26.260> gonna<00:04:26.500> get<00:04:26.680> moved<00:04:26.860> on<00:04:27.010> eventually<00:04:27.580> and

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
is gonna get moved on eventually and

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.750 
is gonna get moved on eventually and
will<00:04:27.849> have<00:04:28.000> the<00:04:28.180> other<00:04:28.680> other<00:04:29.680> cork<00:04:30.220> pad<00:04:30.430> there

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
will have the other other cork pad there

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.629 
will have the other other cork pad there
but<00:04:31.389> it's<00:04:31.510> also<00:04:31.720> tilted<00:04:32.410> so<00:04:32.949> the<00:04:33.039> monitor<00:04:33.430> can

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 
but it's also tilted so the monitor can

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.420 
but it's also tilted so the monitor can
go<00:04:33.760> down<00:04:34.060> nice<00:04:35.020> and<00:04:35.050> flush<00:04:35.590> and<00:04:35.860> sit<00:04:36.039> against

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
go down nice and flush and sit against

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.650 
go down nice and flush and sit against
it<00:04:36.580> you<00:04:36.729> know<00:04:36.849> in<00:04:37.000> case<00:04:37.210> anything<00:04:37.449> ever

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
it you know in case anything ever

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.560 
it you know in case anything ever
happens<00:04:38.080> and<00:04:38.229> not<00:04:38.740> break<00:04:39.039> so<00:04:39.370> monitor<00:04:40.150> goes<00:04:40.300> up

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
happens and not break so monitor goes up

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.040 
happens and not break so monitor goes up
and<00:04:41.070> of<00:04:42.070> course<00:04:42.310> it<00:04:42.700> just<00:04:42.760> wouldn't<00:04:43.539> be<00:04:43.630> a

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
and of course it just wouldn't be a

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.210 
and of course it just wouldn't be a
Windows<00:04:44.979> rig<00:04:45.280> without<00:04:45.669> a<00:04:45.700> random

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
Windows rig without a random

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.370 
Windows rig without a random
err<00:04:46.480> but<00:04:47.480> all<00:04:47.600> I<00:04:47.660> gotta<00:04:47.930> do<00:04:48.140> is<00:04:48.170> fire<00:04:48.680> our<00:04:49.580> chaos

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
err but all I gotta do is fire our chaos

err but all I gotta do is fire our chaos
and<00:04:51.380> of<00:04:51.470> course<00:04:51.710> there<00:04:51.980> it<00:04:52.100> is<00:04:52.220> super<00:04:53.060> easy<00:04:53.090> to

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
and of course there it is super easy to

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.100 
and of course there it is super easy to
use<00:04:53.650> this<00:04:54.650> is<00:04:54.860> one<00:04:55.040> point<00:04:55.370> six<00:04:55.940> point<00:04:56.360> five<00:04:56.720> I
