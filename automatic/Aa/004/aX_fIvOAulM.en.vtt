00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
thought was going to be a quick kind of

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.330 
thought was going to be a quick kind of
thing<00:00:12.599> that<00:00:12.960> if<00:00:13.410> they<00:00:13.530> would<00:00:13.679> have<00:00:13.769> added<00:00:13.980> more

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
they're gonna actually have an actual

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.410 
they're gonna actually have an actual
match<00:00:23.910> for<00:00:24.210> this<00:00:25.849> I'm<00:00:26.849> kind<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.390> little

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
match for this I'm kind of a little

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.790 
match for this I'm kind of a little
hesitant<00:00:28.050> hear<00:00:28.289> about<00:00:28.439> what's<00:00:28.619> going<00:00:28.740> to

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
hesitant hear about what's going to

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.220 
hesitant hear about what's going to
happen<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.939> keep<00:00:30.300> going<00:00:30.480> 50-50<00:00:31.170> on<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:33.230> part

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
happen I I keep going 50-50 on this part

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.900 
happen I I keep going 50-50 on this part
of<00:00:34.350> me<00:00:34.440> thinks<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:34.860> this<00:00:35.100> has<00:00:35.280> basically

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
of me thinks that this has basically

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.389 
of me thinks that this has basically
just<00:00:36.180> been<00:00:36.360> built<00:00:36.600> up<00:00:36.780> as<00:00:37.140> Big<00:00:37.649> Show<00:00:37.860> can't<00:00:38.160> win

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
just been built up as Big Show can't win

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.630 
just been built up as Big Show can't win
so<00:00:38.790> he<00:00:38.969> will<00:00:39.210> win<00:00:40.040> but<00:00:41.040> then<00:00:41.160> part<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.489> me<00:00:41.550> is

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
so he will win but then part of me is

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.799 
so he will win but then part of me is
thinking<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.390> going<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.629> be<00:00:42.719> the

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
thinking that this is going to be the

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.360 
thinking that this is going to be the
match<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.230> night<00:00:43.260> where<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.680> champion

match of the night where the champion

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.580 
match of the night where the champion
retains<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.969> title<00:00:45.000> through<00:00:45.989> some<00:00:46.230> kind<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.500> a

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
retains the title through some kind of a

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.630 
retains the title through some kind of a
screw<00:00:46.829> job<00:00:46.980> like<00:00:47.190> we<00:00:47.280> were<00:00:47.370> talking<00:00:47.579> about

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
take the title off of him now would be

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.770 
take the title off of him now would be
kind<00:03:09.350> of<00:03:09.580> facetious<00:03:11.350> you<00:03:12.350> know<00:03:13.600> for<00:03:14.600> me<00:03:14.750> I

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
kind of facetious you know for me I

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.170 
kind of facetious you know for me I
would<00:03:15.079> rather<00:03:15.260> have<00:03:15.860> him<00:03:16.040> win<00:03:16.340> the<00:03:16.489> match<00:03:16.670> or

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
would rather have him win the match or

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.250 
would rather have him win the match or
even<00:03:17.750> retain<00:03:18.410> by<00:03:19.070> a<00:03:19.100> DQ<00:03:19.820> yeah<00:03:20.600> that's<00:03:21.049> what<00:03:21.110> I'm
