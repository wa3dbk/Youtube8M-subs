00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
back down into its housing so what do I

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.070 
back down into its housing so what do I
like<00:02:44.220> about<00:02:44.250> these<00:02:44.880> props<00:02:45.299> well<00:02:45.660> they're

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
like about these props well they're

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.420 
like about these props well they're
accurate<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.739> of<00:02:46.830> course<00:02:47.010> they're<00:02:47.190> going<00:02:47.340> to

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
accurate and of course they're going to

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.670 
accurate and of course they're going to
be<00:02:47.519> because<00:02:47.820> they<00:02:48.420> are<00:02:48.450> official<00:02:49.170> públicas

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
be because they are official públicas

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.350

but<00:02:50.370> more<00:02:50.519> so<00:02:50.670> than<00:02:50.850> that<00:02:50.970> I<00:02:51.120> like<00:02:51.299> that

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
but more so than that I like that

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.229 
but more so than that I like that
they're<00:02:51.780> real<00:02:52.370> unlike<00:02:53.370> having<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:53.970> plastic

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
they're real unlike having a plastic

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.960 
they're real unlike having a plastic
heavy<00:02:54.780> blade<00:02:55.220> there's<00:02:56.220> just<00:02:56.459> no<00:02:56.640> substitute

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
heavy blade there's just no substitute

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.430 
heavy blade there's just no substitute
for<00:02:57.390> a<00:02:57.690> real<00:02:57.720> metal

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
for a real metal

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.710 
for a real metal
and<00:02:59.920> I<00:03:00.069> have<00:03:00.220> to<00:03:00.340> say<00:03:00.549> that<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.239> outsider

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
and I have to say that the outsider

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.780 
and I have to say that the outsider
hidden<00:03:02.049> blade<00:03:02.230> is<00:03:02.470> one<00:03:02.650> of<00:03:02.799> my<00:03:02.920> favorites<00:03:03.430> the

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
hidden blade is one of my favorites the

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.220 
hidden blade is one of my favorites the
sword<00:03:04.120> and<00:03:04.450> the<00:03:04.510> dagger<00:03:04.810> just<00:03:05.170> so<00:03:05.920> cool<00:03:07.230> being

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
sword and the dagger just so cool being

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.660 
sword and the dagger just so cool being
out<00:03:08.349> of<00:03:08.379> high<00:03:08.590> carbon<00:03:09.040> steel<00:03:09.220> play<00:03:09.459> these

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
out of high carbon steel play these

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.070 
out of high carbon steel play these
things<00:03:09.909> are<00:03:10.150> made<00:03:10.299> for<00:03:10.510> more<00:03:10.690> than<00:03:10.870> just

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
things are made for more than just

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.839 
things are made for more than just
sitting<00:03:11.409> on<00:03:11.590> the<00:03:11.709> wall<00:03:11.890> and<00:03:12.159> collecting<00:03:12.580> dust

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
sitting on the wall and collecting dust

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:14.729 
sitting on the wall and collecting dust
you<00:03:13.569> can<00:03:13.750> swing<00:03:14.019> these<00:03:14.170> things<00:03:14.470> around

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
you can swing these things around

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.080 
you can swing these things around
they're<00:03:14.980> made<00:03:15.220> like<00:03:15.700> real<00:03:16.150> weapons<00:03:16.840> and<00:03:18.090> it's

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
they're made like real weapons and it's

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.210 
they're made like real weapons and it's
just<00:03:19.360> it's<00:03:19.780> really<00:03:19.930> helpful<00:03:20.440> to<00:03:20.769> not<00:03:20.890> have<00:03:21.099> to

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
just it's really helpful to not have to

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.190 
just it's really helpful to not have to
worry<00:03:21.430> about<00:03:21.700> breaking<00:03:22.030> an<00:03:22.540> expensive

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
worry about breaking an expensive

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.140 
worry about breaking an expensive
display<00:03:23.590> piece<00:03:23.860> especially<00:03:24.640> when<00:03:25.030> you're

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
display piece especially when you're

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.600 
display piece especially when you're
using<00:03:25.329> in<00:03:25.569> our<00:03:25.690> movie

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
using in our movie

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.190 
using in our movie
so<00:03:27.610> are<00:03:27.909> there<00:03:28.090> any<00:03:28.209> downsides<00:03:28.450> and<00:03:28.989> I<00:03:29.019> don't

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
so are there any downsides and I don't

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.199 
so are there any downsides and I don't
really<00:03:29.379> have<00:03:29.560> any<00:03:29.799> for<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.579> sword<00:03:30.849> or<00:03:31.180> the

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
really have any for the sword or the

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.410 
really have any for the sword or the
dagger<00:03:31.569> I<00:03:32.260> have<00:03:32.950> seen<00:03:33.340> however<00:03:33.609> reviews<00:03:34.209> on

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
dagger I have seen however reviews on

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.869 
dagger I have seen however reviews on
the<00:03:34.540> dagger<00:03:34.780> where<00:03:35.140> people<00:03:36.010> have<00:03:36.340> sliced

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:36.879 
the dagger where people have sliced

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:39.210 
the dagger where people have sliced
through<00:03:37.390> these<00:03:37.870> straps<00:03:38.590> because<00:03:38.829> they've

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
through these straps because they've

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.160 
through these straps because they've
sharpened<00:03:39.730> their<00:03:39.819> blade<00:03:40.120> I<00:03:40.359> wouldn't

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
sharpened their blade I wouldn't

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.720 
sharpened their blade I wouldn't
recommend<00:03:41.290> sharpening<00:03:41.950> the<00:03:42.040> blade<00:03:42.069> but<00:03:42.519> you

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
recommend sharpening the blade but you

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.300 
recommend sharpening the blade but you
can<00:03:43.060> if<00:03:43.329> you<00:03:43.480> want<00:03:43.659> to<00:03:43.780> other<00:03:44.709> than<00:03:44.920> that<00:03:45.069> I've

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
can if you want to other than that I've

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.610 
can if you want to other than that I've
heard<00:03:45.549> of<00:03:45.640> people<00:03:45.849> have<00:03:46.659> their<00:03:46.959> blades<00:03:47.260> fall

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
heard of people have their blades fall

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.559 
heard of people have their blades fall
out<00:03:47.859> when<00:03:48.250> they<00:03:48.489> have<00:03:48.790> it<00:03:48.940> strapped<00:03:49.269> to<00:03:49.420> the

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
out when they have it strapped to the

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.660 
out when they have it strapped to the
back<00:03:49.750> which<00:03:50.440> makes<00:03:50.709> sense<00:03:51.010> it's<00:03:51.190> gravity

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
back which makes sense it's gravity

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.880 
back which makes sense it's gravity
these<00:03:51.879> things<00:03:52.180> aren't<00:03:52.450> really<00:03:52.810> holding<00:03:53.590> blade

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
these things aren't really holding blade

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.580 
these things aren't really holding blade
too<00:03:54.129> tightly<00:03:54.459> in<00:03:54.840> so<00:03:55.840> you<00:03:55.930> notice<00:03:56.379> in<00:03:56.500> the

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
too tightly in so you notice in the

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.009 
too tightly in so you notice in the
beginning<00:03:56.950> of<00:03:57.099> my<00:03:57.220> video<00:03:57.400> that<00:03:58.030> I<00:03:58.060> don't<00:03:58.599> wear

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
beginning of my video that I don't wear

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.099 
beginning of my video that I don't wear
the<00:03:59.379> the<00:03:59.920> blade<00:04:00.190> as<00:04:00.430> I<00:04:00.579> walk<00:04:00.790> into<00:04:01.030> the<00:04:01.239> scene

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
the the blade as I walk into the scene

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:03.629 
the the blade as I walk into the scene
I<00:04:02.140> kept<00:04:02.650> it<00:04:02.799> off<00:04:02.919> and<00:04:03.190> I<00:04:03.220> kept<00:04:03.430> it<00:04:03.519> off

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:03.639 
I kept it off and I kept it off

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:04.979 
I kept it off and I kept it off
especially<00:04:03.880> during<00:04:04.299> the<00:04:04.450> fight<00:04:04.630> scenes<00:04:04.840> but

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
especially during the fight scenes but

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:06.449 
especially during the fight scenes but
any<00:04:05.200> close-ups<00:04:05.650> I<00:04:05.769> tried<00:04:06.010> to<00:04:06.099> keep<00:04:06.250> it

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
any close-ups I tried to keep it

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.759 
any close-ups I tried to keep it
attached<00:04:07.389> I'm<00:04:07.599> back<00:04:07.900> and<00:04:08.169> it<00:04:08.380> seemed<00:04:08.650> to<00:04:08.739> work

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
attached I'm back and it seemed to work

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.909 
attached I'm back and it seemed to work
fine<00:04:09.400> for<00:04:09.430> me<00:04:09.819> other<00:04:10.660> than<00:04:10.810> that<00:04:10.959> I<00:04:11.230> don't

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:11.919 
fine for me other than that I don't

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:14.220 
fine for me other than that I don't
really<00:04:12.010> have<00:04:12.220> much<00:04:12.430> to<00:04:12.760> say<00:04:13.389> bad<00:04:13.660> about<00:04:13.870> the

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
really have much to say bad about the

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.110 
really have much to say bad about the
hidden<00:04:14.560> blade<00:04:14.859> there<00:04:15.160> is<00:04:15.280> one<00:04:15.519> issue<00:04:15.730> that

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
hidden blade there is one issue that

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.120 
hidden blade there is one issue that
I've<00:04:16.269> had<00:04:16.510> that<00:04:16.660> I<00:04:16.780> know<00:04:16.840> others<00:04:17.620> have<00:04:17.829> had<00:04:17.979> as

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
I've had that I know others have had as

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.000 
I've had that I know others have had as
well<00:04:18.370> is<00:04:18.940> this<00:04:19.329> locking<00:04:19.750> mechanism<00:04:20.680> which

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
well is this locking mechanism which

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.670 
well is this locking mechanism which
holds<00:04:21.880> the<00:04:22.030> blade<00:04:22.270> out<00:04:22.500> prevents<00:04:23.500> it<00:04:23.620> from

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
holds the blade out prevents it from

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.180 
holds the blade out prevents it from
going<00:04:23.979> in<00:04:24.130> also<00:04:24.849> is<00:04:25.030> supposed<00:04:25.330> to<00:04:25.979> retain<00:04:26.979> the

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
going in also is supposed to retain the

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.980 
going in also is supposed to retain the
blade<00:04:27.400> so<00:04:27.880> it's<00:04:28.030> supposed<00:04:28.270> to<00:04:28.360> keep<00:04:28.570> the<00:04:28.750> blade

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
blade so it's supposed to keep the blade

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.370 
blade so it's supposed to keep the blade
locked<00:04:29.889> in<00:04:30.190> so<00:04:30.520> if<00:04:30.699> you<00:04:30.729> you<00:04:31.599> know<00:04:31.690> should<00:04:32.229> try

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
locked in so if you you know should try

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.279 
locked in so if you you know should try
to<00:04:32.440> shoot<00:04:32.740> it<00:04:32.860> out<00:04:33.039> while<00:04:33.460> it's<00:04:33.639> still<00:04:33.880> locked

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
to shoot it out while it's still locked

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:36.230 
to shoot it out while it's still locked
no<00:04:35.289> problem

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
no problem

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.870 
no problem
however<00:04:37.240> it<00:04:38.110> broke<00:04:38.500> that<00:04:39.039> that<00:04:39.400> bound<00:04:39.610> lock
