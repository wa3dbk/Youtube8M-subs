we<00:00:05.680> don't<00:00:06.070> have<00:00:06.190> a<00:00:06.220> formula<00:00:06.930> with<00:00:07.930> photography

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:08.920 
we don't have a formula with photography

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.200 
we don't have a formula with photography
lights<00:00:09.160> that<00:00:09.340> we're<00:00:09.460> going<00:00:09.550> to<00:00:09.610> repeat<00:00:10.030> over

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:10.210 
lights that we're going to repeat over

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.970 
lights that we're going to repeat over
and<00:00:10.420> over<00:00:10.600> again<00:00:10.690> every<00:00:11.470> time<00:00:11.650> you<00:00:11.800> go<00:00:11.920> to

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:11.980 
and over again every time you go to

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.289 
and over again every time you go to
somebody's<00:00:12.430> house<00:00:12.639> you're<00:00:12.879> going<00:00:13.000> to<00:00:13.059> find

somebody's house you're going to find

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:15.480 
somebody's house you're going to find
something<00:00:13.660> new<00:00:13.840> and<00:00:14.110> that's<00:00:15.100> what<00:00:15.250> it's<00:00:15.370> all

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.490 
something new and that's what it's all

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.300 
something new and that's what it's all
about<00:00:16.080> okay<00:00:17.080> so<00:00:17.140> let<00:00:17.410> me<00:00:17.500> get<00:00:17.620> my<00:00:17.740> camera<00:00:17.980> gear

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.310 
about okay so let me get my camera gear

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.700 
about okay so let me get my camera gear
and<00:00:18.370> then<00:00:18.610> we'll<00:00:18.810> take<00:00:19.810> some<00:00:19.840> photographs

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:20.710 
and then we'll take some photographs

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.680 
and then we'll take some photographs
remember<00:00:21.100> 90%<00:00:21.700> of<00:00:21.760> the<00:00:21.880> time<00:00:22.090> is<00:00:22.270> looking<00:00:22.570> at

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:22.690 
remember 90% of the time is looking at

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.810 
remember 90% of the time is looking at
the<00:00:22.810> light<00:00:22.990> then<00:00:23.860> once<00:00:24.100> we<00:00:24.280> have<00:00:24.430> our<00:00:24.460> setup

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
the light then once we have our setup

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.030 
the light then once we have our setup
the<00:00:25.150> photography<00:00:25.720> is<00:00:25.780> really<00:00:26.080> simple<00:00:26.500> so

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:27.040 
the photography is really simple so

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.750 
the photography is really simple so
let's<00:00:27.220> do<00:00:27.370> that

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.400 

the<00:00:31.030> very<00:00:31.210> first<00:00:31.510> thing<00:00:31.690> to<00:00:31.870> remember<00:00:31.960> is<00:00:32.320> to

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
the very first thing to remember is to

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.650 
the very first thing to remember is to
always<00:00:32.559> be<00:00:32.980> back<00:00:33.219> at<00:00:33.430> least<00:00:33.700> 10<00:00:34.000> feet<00:00:34.270> from<00:00:34.540> the

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
always be back at least 10 feet from the

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.840 
always be back at least 10 feet from the
model<00:00:35.050> if<00:00:35.440> you're<00:00:35.710> any<00:00:35.860> closer<00:00:36.250> you<00:00:36.579> get<00:00:36.700> all

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
model if you're any closer you get all

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.329 
model if you're any closer you get all
sorts<00:00:37.210> of<00:00:37.300> fisheye<00:00:37.749> effects<00:00:38.170> things<00:00:38.890> we<00:00:39.129> don't

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:39.339 
sorts of fisheye effects things we don't

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:41.579 
sorts of fisheye effects things we don't
want<00:00:39.579> so<00:00:39.850> be<00:00:39.999> back<00:00:40.179> at<00:00:40.359> least<00:00:40.510> 10<00:00:40.839> feet<00:00:41.079> if<00:00:41.350> not

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:41.589 
want so be back at least 10 feet if not

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:43.829 
want so be back at least 10 feet if not
more<00:00:41.980> especially<00:00:42.789> if<00:00:43.089> you're<00:00:43.210> doing<00:00:43.300> a<00:00:43.510> full

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:43.839 
more especially if you're doing a full

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:46.590 
more especially if you're doing a full
length<00:00:44.129> because<00:00:45.129> then<00:00:45.850> you<00:00:45.969> really<00:00:46.269> have<00:00:46.420> to

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
length because then you really have to

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.380 
length because then you really have to
worry<00:00:47.469> about<00:00:47.649> things<00:00:48.309> getting<00:00:48.489> foreshortened

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
worry about things getting foreshortened

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.529 
worry about things getting foreshortened
too<00:00:49.510> much<00:00:50.100> getting<00:00:51.100> that<00:00:51.219> blood<00:00:51.670> read<00:00:52.120> and

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:52.539 
too much getting that blood read and

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:56.189 
too much getting that blood read and
nose<00:00:53.140> and<00:00:53.530> the<00:00:54.519> cheeks<00:00:54.819> and<00:00:55.239> the<00:00:55.329> ears<00:00:55.659> and

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
nose and the cheeks and the ears and

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.099 
nose and the cheeks and the ears and
that<00:00:56.559> stands<00:00:57.039> in<00:00:57.280> contrast<00:00:57.339> to<00:00:58.149> the<00:00:58.479> greens<00:00:58.809> or

00:00:59.099 --> 00:00:59.109 
that stands in contrast to the greens or

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:03.000 
that stands in contrast to the greens or
the<00:00:59.260> neutrals<00:01:00.179> that's<00:01:01.179> what<00:01:01.710> that's<00:01:02.710> the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
the neutrals that's what that's the

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.950 
the neutrals that's what that's the
dance<00:01:03.249> of<00:01:03.670> flesh<00:01:03.969> tone<00:01:04.239> that<00:01:04.510> is<00:01:04.659> where<00:01:04.870> you

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
dance of flesh tone that is where you

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.190 
dance of flesh tone that is where you
get<00:01:05.140> those<00:01:05.350> beautiful<00:01:06.270> it's<00:01:07.270> that<00:01:07.540> contrast

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
get those beautiful it's that contrast

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.660 
get those beautiful it's that contrast
you<00:01:08.500> know<00:01:08.650> I<00:01:08.860> mean<00:01:09.040> look<00:01:09.250> how<00:01:09.399> red<00:01:09.850> that<00:01:10.240> is

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
you know I mean look how red that is

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.590 
you know I mean look how red that is
compared<00:01:12.670> to<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:15.369> neutral<00:01:15.790> colors<00:01:16.180> over

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
compared to the neutral colors over

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:24.429 
compared to the neutral colors over
there<00:01:16.780> on<00:01:16.899> the<00:01:16.960> other<00:01:17.079> side<00:01:17.229> of<00:01:17.500> the<00:01:17.590> palette

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.230 

start<00:01:24.950> I<00:01:25.040> try<00:01:25.280> to<00:01:25.340> start<00:01:25.640> with<00:01:25.729> the<00:01:25.820> darkest

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
start I try to start with the darkest

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.179 
start I try to start with the darkest
colors<00:01:26.600> but<00:01:26.840> what<00:01:27.229> I'm<00:01:27.350> really<00:01:27.530> doing<00:01:27.650> is

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
colors but what I'm really doing is

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.130 
colors but what I'm really doing is
trying<00:01:28.549> to<00:01:28.640> get<00:01:28.880> in<00:01:29.000> this<00:01:29.210> lay<00:01:29.600> in<00:01:29.750> those<00:01:29.930> key

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
trying to get in this lay in those key

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:41.870 
trying to get in this lay in those key
points

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.060 

most<00:01:42.450> people<00:01:42.870> will<00:01:42.990> take<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.350> shortcut<00:01:43.860> just

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
most people will take the shortcut just

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.280 
most people will take the shortcut just
paint<00:01:44.370> that<00:01:44.460> all<00:01:44.700> in<00:01:44.909> dark<00:01:45.180> then<00:01:45.540> paint<00:01:45.930> the

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
paint that all in dark then paint the

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.290 
paint that all in dark then paint the
the<00:01:46.710> highlight<00:01:47.130> on<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.700> paint<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.090> light

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
the highlight on the paint the light

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.240 
the highlight on the paint the light
skin<00:01:48.630> color<00:01:48.930> next<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.710> then<00:01:49.830> blend<00:01:50.160> it

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
skin color next to it and then blend it

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.770 
skin color next to it and then blend it
a<00:01:50.370> little<00:01:50.400> bit<00:01:50.760> between<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.300> to<00:01:51.450> get<00:01:51.600> that

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
a little bit between it to get that

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.170 
a little bit between it to get that
lighter<00:01:52.050> color<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.590> believe<00:01:53.490> me<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:53.700> color

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
lighter color and believe me that color

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
lighter color and believe me that color
is<00:01:54.510> not<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.050> same<00:01:55.380> as<00:01:56.210> a<00:01:57.210> color<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.990> you

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
is not the same as a color that you

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.010 
is not the same as a color that you
would<00:01:58.320> get<00:01:58.590> if<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:59.369> went<00:01:59.580> in<00:01:59.729> there<00:01:59.940> and<00:02:00.210> mix

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
would get if you went in there and mix

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:11.610 
would get if you went in there and mix
the<00:02:01.290> color<00:02:01.560> itself

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:37.870 

you

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.330 

which<00:02:38.880> freckle<00:02:39.420> is<00:02:39.600> more<00:02:39.840> subtle

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.430 

just<00:02:44.940> a<00:02:45.090> little<00:02:45.330> bit<00:02:45.420> of<00:02:45.540> stain<00:02:45.840> in<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.080> brush

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
just a little bit of stain in the brush

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.900 
just a little bit of stain in the brush
and<00:02:46.680> here<00:02:46.860> I'm<00:02:46.950> dealing<00:02:47.250> with<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.459> optical

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
and here I'm dealing with the optical

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.580 
and here I'm dealing with the optical
illusion<00:02:48.000> because<00:02:48.480> that<00:02:48.870> freckle<00:02:49.380> in<00:02:49.440> the

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
illusion because that freckle in the

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.460 
illusion because that freckle in the
shadow<00:02:50.090> there<00:02:51.090> on<00:02:51.270> your<00:02:51.420> skin<00:02:51.780> is<00:02:52.110> going<00:02:52.319> to<00:02:52.380> be

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
shadow there on your skin is going to be

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.380 
shadow there on your skin is going to be
way<00:02:52.800> darker<00:02:53.310> than<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.550> one<00:02:53.580> on<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:53.970> highlight

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
way darker than the one on the highlight

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.880 
way darker than the one on the highlight
but<00:02:54.630> it<00:02:54.750> looks<00:02:54.959> like<00:02:55.170> they're<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.590> same<00:02:55.620> but

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
but it looks like they're the same but

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.059 
but it looks like they're the same but
that's<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.640> optical<00:02:57.090> illusion<00:02:57.800> now<00:02:58.800> I'm<00:02:58.890> just

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
that's the optical illusion now I'm just

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.710 
that's the optical illusion now I'm just
putting<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.430> little<00:02:59.730> bit<00:02:59.880> of<00:03:02.569> scribble<00:03:03.569> or

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
putting a little bit of scribble or

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.660 
putting a little bit of scribble or
whatever<00:03:03.989> it<00:03:04.170> is<00:03:04.260> just<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:04.830> sort<00:03:05.069> of<00:03:05.160> hint<00:03:05.489> at

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
whatever it is just to sort of hint at

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.330 
whatever it is just to sort of hint at
some<00:03:05.910> of<00:03:06.030> those<00:03:06.180> very<00:03:06.480> very<00:03:06.720> light<00:03:07.230> just<00:03:08.160> a

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
some of those very very light just a

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.580 
some of those very very light just a
hint<00:03:08.580> I<00:03:08.700> sure<00:03:09.000> didn't<00:03:09.390> go<00:03:09.540> in<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:10.020> match<00:03:10.350> your

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
hint I sure didn't go in and match your

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:17.470 
hint I sure didn't go in and match your
freckle<00:03:11.040> for<00:03:11.220> freckle<00:03:11.610> I<00:03:11.700> can<00:03:11.880> assure<00:03:11.970> you

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.210 

again<00:03:18.480> this<00:03:18.840> is<00:03:19.050> like<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.380> reflection<00:03:20.010> in<00:03:20.100> the

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
again this is like the reflection in the

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.780 
again this is like the reflection in the
eye<00:03:20.250> I'll<00:03:20.670> put<00:03:20.940> a<00:03:20.970> dot<00:03:21.360> of<00:03:22.280> color<00:03:23.280> that's<00:03:23.610> not

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
eye I'll put a dot of color that's not

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.170 
eye I'll put a dot of color that's not
quite<00:03:24.209> as<00:03:24.510> bright<00:03:24.900> as<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.470> highlight<00:03:25.950> a<00:03:26.280> step

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
quite as bright as the highlight a step

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.660 
quite as bright as the highlight a step
under<00:03:27.630> it<00:03:27.780> over<00:03:28.470> paint<00:03:28.739> it<00:03:28.920> a<00:03:28.980> little<00:03:29.190> bit<00:03:29.430> and

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
under it over paint it a little bit and

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.130 
under it over paint it a little bit and
then<00:03:30.360> inside<00:03:31.050> that<00:03:31.110> color<00:03:31.830> I<00:03:32.190> will<00:03:32.910> put<00:03:33.150> a<00:03:33.330> the

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
then inside that color I will put a the

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.100 
then inside that color I will put a the
brightest<00:03:34.709> dot<00:03:35.090> inside<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.450> color<00:03:36.720> that<00:03:36.989> I've

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
brightest dot inside the color that I've

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.540 
brightest dot inside the color that I've
already<00:03:37.350> painted

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:51.620 

like<00:03:44.150> that

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:58.010 

you

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.080 

you
