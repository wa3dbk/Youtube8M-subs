there<00:00:27.350> still<00:00:27.530> seem<00:00:27.680> to<00:00:27.710> be<00:00:27.770> some<00:00:28.070> confusion

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:28.430 
there still seem to be some confusion

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.859 
there still seem to be some confusion
about<00:00:28.490> how<00:00:28.700> exactly<00:00:28.880> this<00:00:29.180> is<00:00:29.360> done<00:00:29.539> so<00:00:29.750> I'm

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
about how exactly this is done so I'm

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.580 
about how exactly this is done so I'm
going<00:00:30.050> to<00:00:30.110> actually<00:00:30.619> record<00:00:31.070> me<00:00:31.760> doing<00:00:32.300> this

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
going to actually record me doing this

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.479 
going to actually record me doing this
and<00:00:33.590> hopefully<00:00:33.739> it'll<00:00:33.949> make<00:00:34.039> a<00:00:34.160> little<00:00:34.340> easier

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
and hopefully it'll make a little easier

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.180

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
notice that it actually says tail gate

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.719 
notice that it actually says tail gate
very<00:00:45.710> important<00:00:46.100> there's<00:00:46.219> also<00:00:46.370> a<00:00:46.489> hood

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:46.729 
very important there's also a hood

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:49.149 
very important there's also a hood
version<00:00:47.210> of<00:00:47.300> this<00:00:47.589> it's<00:00:48.589> a<00:00:48.710> different<00:00:49.010> size

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:49.159 
version of this it's a different size

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:52.360 
version of this it's a different size
the<00:00:49.579> the<00:00:50.379> angle<00:00:51.379> of<00:00:51.499> the<00:00:51.589> back<00:00:51.739> is<00:00:52.010> different

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
the the angle of the back is different

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.369 
the the angle of the back is different
so<00:00:52.550> if<00:00:52.609> you<00:00:52.729> get<00:00:52.909> the<00:00:53.030> hood<00:00:53.300> ornament<00:00:54.199> and<00:00:54.260> try

so if you get the hood ornament and try

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.410 
so if you get the hood ornament and try
to<00:00:54.440> put<00:00:54.620> it<00:00:54.710> on<00:00:54.769> the<00:00:54.859> tailgate<00:00:55.069> it<00:00:56.030> won't<00:00:56.210> sit

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
to put it on the tailgate it won't sit

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.930 
to put it on the tailgate it won't sit
properly<00:00:56.749> and<00:00:57.219> just<00:00:58.219> create<00:00:58.729> a<00:00:58.760> lot<00:00:58.879> of

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
properly and just create a lot of

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.629 
properly and just create a lot of
trouble<00:00:59.210> for<00:00:59.299> you<00:00:59.449> also<00:01:00.379> the<00:01:00.710> the<00:01:01.159> posts<00:01:01.519> on

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
this is a crafting wire that's actually

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.270 
this is a crafting wire that's actually
plastic<00:01:32.149> coated<00:01:32.679> so<00:01:33.679> hopefully<00:01:33.920> it'll<00:01:34.039> cut

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
plastic coated so hopefully it'll cut

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.980

so<00:02:39.730> when<00:02:40.240> I<00:02:40.300> was<00:02:40.420> testing<00:02:40.750> out<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:42.070> cutting

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
so when I was testing out the cutting

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.760 
so when I was testing out the cutting
materials<00:02:43.060> earlier<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:44.080> Sun<00:02:44.470> had<00:02:44.590> been<00:02:44.650> on

the<00:02:44.890> logo<00:02:45.040> for<00:02:45.370> quite<00:02:45.520> a<00:02:45.550> while<00:02:45.700> on<00:02:45.850> it<00:02:45.970> that

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
the logo for quite a while on it that

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.060 
the logo for quite a while on it that
heated<00:02:46.270> up<00:02:46.360> the<00:02:46.450> glue<00:02:46.570> pretty<00:02:46.780> nicely<00:02:47.070> since

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
heated up the glue pretty nicely since

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.060 
heated up the glue pretty nicely since
then<00:02:48.280> has<00:02:48.370> come<00:02:48.520> back<00:02:49.120> behind<00:02:49.270> a<00:02:49.420> tree<00:02:50.010> so<00:02:51.010> I'm

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
then has come back behind a tree so I'm

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.620 
then has come back behind a tree so I'm
going<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:51.220> be<00:02:51.310> used<00:02:51.460> the<00:02:51.610> old<00:02:51.730> hairdryer<00:02:52.330> trick

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.120 
going to be used the old hairdryer trick
to<00:02:52.840> warm<00:02:53.230> up<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.440> glue<00:02:53.560> and<00:02:53.710> see<00:02:53.800> if<00:02:53.860> I<00:02:53.920> can<00:02:54.010> get

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
to warm up the glue and see if I can get

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:01.080 
to warm up the glue and see if I can get
the<00:02:54.280> cutting<00:02:54.610> go<00:02:54.790> a<00:02:54.820> little<00:02:54.940> faster<00:02:59.850> yeah<00:03:00.850> so

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
the cutting go a little faster yeah so

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.250 
the cutting go a little faster yeah so
two<00:03:01.240> foot<00:03:01.450> seconds<00:03:01.810> with<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:01.960> hairdryer
