exercise<00:00:12.760> is<00:00:13.389> going<00:00:13.690> to<00:00:13.809> be<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.980> quadrupedal

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:15.939 
exercise is going to be a quadrupedal

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:17.599 
exercise is going to be a quadrupedal
movement<00:00:16.090> now<00:00:16.449> this<00:00:16.570> is<00:00:16.689> one<00:00:16.840> of<00:00:16.869> the<00:00:16.990> basic

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
movement now this is one of the basic

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.590

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
Bend here and then the most important

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.600 
Bend here and then the most important
thing<00:00:44.470> is<00:00:44.680> you're<00:00:44.770> going<00:00:44.890> to<00:00:44.950> be<00:00:45.040> stepping

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
thing is you're going to be stepping

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.780 
thing is you're going to be stepping
with<00:00:46.890> reciprocating<00:00:47.890> motion<00:00:48.010> so<00:00:48.340> your<00:00:48.579> left

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
with reciprocating motion so your left

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.450 
with reciprocating motion so your left
hand<00:00:49.120> and<00:00:49.300> your<00:00:50.290> right<00:00:50.320> foot<00:00:50.559> are<00:00:51.100> going<00:00:51.340> to<00:00:51.399> be

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
hand and your right foot are going to be

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.170 
hand and your right foot are going to be
moving<00:00:51.610> at<00:00:51.790> the<00:00:51.850> same<00:00:52.000> time<00:00:52.210> like<00:00:53.170> so<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:55.090> we're

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
moving at the same time like so so we're

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.869 
moving at the same time like so so we're
going<00:00:55.270> to<00:00:55.360> be<00:00:55.420> stepping<00:00:55.840> back<00:00:56.079> and<00:00:56.260> forth<00:00:56.879> for

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
going to be stepping back and forth for

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:00.510 
going to be stepping back and forth for
30<00:00:57.910> seconds<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:59.590> you<00:00:59.680> can<00:00:59.800> take<00:01:00.010> two<00:01:00.219> steps

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
30 seconds so you can take two steps

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.979 
30 seconds so you can take two steps
here<00:01:00.670> back<00:01:01.629> and<00:01:01.809> forth<00:01:03.449> now<00:01:04.449> if<00:01:04.539> this<00:01:04.659> is<00:01:04.839> too

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
here back and forth now if this is too

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.649 
here back and forth now if this is too
complicated<00:01:05.379> you<00:01:05.680> can<00:01:05.950> start<00:01:06.189> off<00:01:06.340> with<00:01:06.659> knees

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
complicated you can start off with knees

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:09.090 
complicated you can start off with knees
on<00:01:07.840> the<00:01:07.930> ground<00:01:08.170> and<00:01:08.409> hands<00:01:08.710> on<00:01:08.890> the<00:01:08.950> ground

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
on the ground and hands on the ground

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.740 
on the ground and hands on the ground
you<00:01:09.610> should<00:01:09.790> work<00:01:09.940> on<00:01:10.030> that<00:01:10.090> reciprocating

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
you should work on that reciprocating

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.710 
you should work on that reciprocating
motion<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.640> then<00:01:12.760> eventually<00:01:13.210> work<00:01:13.450> your<00:01:13.630> way

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
motion and then eventually work your way

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.060 
motion and then eventually work your way
up<00:01:13.900> to<00:01:14.250> here<00:01:15.250> and<00:01:15.600> then<00:01:16.600> step

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
up to here and then step

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.620 
up to here and then step
but<00:01:18.670> we're<00:01:18.820> going<00:01:18.909> to<00:01:18.970> do<00:01:19.090> this<00:01:19.180> for<00:01:19.420> 30

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
but we're going to do this for 30

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.490 
but we're going to do this for 30
seconds<00:01:20.080> and<00:01:21.070> then<00:01:21.130> go<00:01:21.280> directly<00:01:21.940> into<00:01:22.500> butt

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500

so<00:01:53.979> you're<00:01:54.070> going<00:01:54.190> to<00:01:54.220> go<00:01:54.310> two<00:01:54.520> steps<00:01:54.700> forward

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
so you're going to go two steps forward

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.710 
so you're going to go two steps forward
two<00:01:55.720> steps<00:01:55.990> back<00:01:56.910> now<00:01:57.910> if<00:01:58.060> this<00:01:58.210> is<00:01:58.390> too<00:01:58.539> much

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
two steps back now if this is too much

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.499 
two steps back now if this is too much
for<00:01:58.990> you<00:01:59.080> for<00:01:59.350> some<00:01:59.500> people<00:01:59.800> it<00:01:59.890> will<00:02:00.039> be<00:02:00.509> you

can place one heel on the ground and use

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.690 
can place one heel on the ground and use
that<00:02:04.180> for<00:02:04.390> assistance<00:02:04.899> if<00:02:05.770> that's<00:02:06.009> too<00:02:06.220> much

put<00:02:07.360> both<00:02:07.509> hills<00:02:07.780> on<00:02:07.930> the<00:02:07.960> ground<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:10.509> we're

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
put both hills on the ground so we're

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.440 
put both hills on the ground so we're
going<00:02:10.690> to<00:02:10.750> do<00:02:10.840> this<00:02:10.959> for<00:02:11.170> 30<00:02:11.320> seconds<00:02:12.209> then<00:02:13.209> go

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
going to do this for 30 seconds then go

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.600 
going to do this for 30 seconds then go
directly<00:02:13.630> into<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.290> next<00:02:14.470> exercise<00:02:14.680> now<00:02:15.459> this

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
directly into the next exercise now this

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.790 
directly into the next exercise now this
third<00:02:15.820> exercise<00:02:16.120> is<00:02:16.330> called<00:02:16.630> ninja<00:02:16.989> jumps<00:02:17.410> so

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
third exercise is called ninja jumps so

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.900 
third exercise is called ninja jumps so
you've<00:02:17.890> probably<00:02:18.070> seen<00:02:18.340> jumps<00:02:18.640> before<00:02:18.850> you

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
you've probably seen jumps before you

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.550 
you've probably seen jumps before you
jump<00:02:19.150> up<00:02:19.269> and<00:02:19.330> land<00:02:19.930> but<00:02:20.110> this<00:02:20.260> is<00:02:20.350> going<00:02:20.470> to

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
jump up and land but this is going to

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.690 
jump up and land but this is going to
take<00:02:20.680> it<00:02:20.830> a<00:02:20.890> step<00:02:21.130> further

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
take it a step further

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.890 
take it a step further
we're<00:02:21.820> really<00:02:21.910> going<00:02:22.060> to<00:02:22.150> focus<00:02:22.330> on<00:02:22.660> our

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
we're really going to focus on our

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.500 
we're really going to focus on our
balance<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:23.470> our<00:02:24.100> coordination<00:02:24.519> and<00:02:24.940> our

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
balance and our coordination and our

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.000 
balance and our coordination and our
agility<00:02:26.019> here<00:02:26.200> so<00:02:26.470> what<00:02:26.650> we're<00:02:26.739> going<00:02:26.830> to<00:02:26.890> do

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
agility here so what we're going to do

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.150 
agility here so what we're going to do
is<00:02:27.190> go<00:02:27.730> as<00:02:28.000> we<00:02:28.269> are<00:02:28.390> for<00:02:28.630> a<00:02:28.660> normal<00:02:28.930> jump<00:02:29.160> throw

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
is go as we are for a normal jump throw

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.070 
is go as we are for a normal jump throw
the<00:02:30.340> arms<00:02:30.610> up<00:02:30.760> break<00:02:31.299> bring<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.900> knees<00:02:32.049> up

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
the arms up break bring the knees up

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.870 
the arms up break bring the knees up
drive<00:02:32.500> them<00:02:32.680> up<00:02:32.799> in<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:32.980> air<00:02:33.070> but<00:02:33.640> when<00:02:33.790> we

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
drive them up in the air but when we

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.449 
drive them up in the air but when we
land<00:02:34.120> we<00:02:34.630> want<00:02:34.840> to<00:02:34.930> land<00:02:35.110> as<00:02:35.260> soft<00:02:35.560> as<00:02:35.739> possible

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
land we want to land as soft as possible

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.400 
land we want to land as soft as possible
just<00:02:36.790> like<00:02:36.910> a<00:02:36.940> ninja<00:02:37.180> would<00:02:37.510> so<00:02:38.110> you<00:02:38.170> want<00:02:38.350> to

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
just like a ninja would so you want to

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.350 
just like a ninja would so you want to
land<00:02:38.530> on<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.739> balls<00:02:38.950> of<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:39.190> feet<00:02:39.269> put<00:02:40.269> the

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
land on the balls of the feet put the

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.000 
land on the balls of the feet put the
arms<00:02:40.600> in<00:02:40.660> front<00:02:40.840> and<00:02:41.320> you<00:02:41.410> really<00:02:41.620> stick<00:02:41.860> that

arms in front and you really stick that

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.110 
arms in front and you really stick that
Lane<00:02:42.220> you<00:02:42.340> can<00:02:42.459> try<00:02:42.640> to<00:02:42.700> stay<00:02:42.910> really

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
Lane you can try to stay really

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.660 
Lane you can try to stay really
controlled<00:02:43.600> so<00:02:44.290> we're<00:02:44.470> doing<00:02:44.650> this<00:02:44.860> don't

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
controlled so we're doing this don't

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.100 
controlled so we're doing this don't
really<00:02:45.910> think<00:02:46.060> about<00:02:46.329> going<00:02:46.510> really<00:02:46.810> fast

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
really think about going really fast

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.870 
really think about going really fast
thinking<00:02:47.680> about<00:02:47.799> going<00:02:47.950> with<00:02:48.070> control<00:02:48.610> and

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
thinking about going with control and

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.670 
thinking about going with control and
coordination<00:02:49.690> so<00:02:50.260> it's<00:02:50.380> going<00:02:50.500> to<00:02:50.560> look<00:02:50.620> like

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
coordination so it's going to look like

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.610 
coordination so it's going to look like
this<00:02:50.970> up<00:02:51.970> in<00:02:52.510> Lane

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
this up in Lane

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.940 
this up in Lane
Oh<00:02:54.180> anyway<00:02:55.180> we're<00:02:56.080> going<00:02:56.200> to<00:02:56.260> do<00:02:56.379> that<00:02:56.530> for<00:02:56.739> 30

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
Oh anyway we're going to do that for 30

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.190 
Oh anyway we're going to do that for 30
seconds<00:02:57.489> then<00:02:57.940> go<00:02:58.120> directly<00:02:58.269> into<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:58.959> next

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
seconds then go directly into the next

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.530 
seconds then go directly into the next
exercise<00:02:59.470> this<00:03:00.310> next<00:03:00.670> exercise<00:03:00.760> is<00:03:01.060> another

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
exercise this next exercise is another

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.570 
exercise this next exercise is another
form<00:03:01.930> of<00:03:02.019> quadrupedal<00:03:02.650> movement<00:03:02.769> we're<00:03:03.459> going

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
form of quadrupedal movement we're going

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.430 
form of quadrupedal movement we're going
to<00:03:03.640> get<00:03:03.730> down<00:03:03.879> on<00:03:03.940> all<00:03:04.150> fours<00:03:04.180> and<00:03:04.720> instead<00:03:05.290> of

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
to get down on all fours and instead of

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.080 
to get down on all fours and instead of
going<00:03:05.680> back<00:03:05.860> and<00:03:05.920> forth<00:03:06.159> the<00:03:06.730> forward<00:03:07.030> and

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
going back and forth the forward and

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.250 
going back and forth the forward and
backward<00:03:07.269> we're<00:03:07.510> going<00:03:07.629> to<00:03:07.690> go<00:03:07.780> side<00:03:08.080> to<00:03:08.110> side

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
backward we're going to go side to side

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.020 
backward we're going to go side to side
so<00:03:09.129> make<00:03:09.340> sure<00:03:09.370> keep<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:10.390> butt<00:03:10.599> down<00:03:10.810> low<00:03:11.079> and

left right then carry the feet over one
at<00:03:17.769> a<00:03:17.799> time<00:03:20.099> now<00:03:21.099> the<00:03:21.159> great<00:03:21.489> thing<00:03:21.700> about

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
at a time now the great thing about

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.000 
at a time now the great thing about
these<00:03:22.090> exercises<00:03:22.299> especially<00:03:23.019> quadrupedal

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
these exercises especially quadrupedal

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.119 
these exercises especially quadrupedal
movement<00:03:24.129> and<00:03:25.140> Budd<00:03:26.140> skirts<00:03:26.410> as<00:03:26.709> you<00:03:26.920> can

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:27.129 
movement and Budd skirts as you can

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:30.119 
movement and Budd skirts as you can
raise<00:03:27.879> the<00:03:28.060> intensity<00:03:28.420> with<00:03:29.319> how<00:03:29.500> fast<00:03:29.769> you<00:03:29.950> go

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:30.129 
raise the intensity with how fast you go

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:32.640 
raise the intensity with how fast you go
so<00:03:30.849> if<00:03:30.910> you<00:03:31.000> want<00:03:31.150> to<00:03:31.209> get<00:03:31.299> more<00:03:31.420> cardio<00:03:31.780> go<00:03:32.620> a

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
so if you want to get more cardio go a

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.849 
so if you want to get more cardio go a
little<00:03:32.829> bit<00:03:32.980> faster<00:03:34.140> let<00:03:35.140> me<00:03:35.230> go<00:03:35.349> directly

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
little bit faster let me go directly

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:38.910 
little bit faster let me go directly

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
then go directly into our last exercise

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:58.800 
then go directly into our last exercise
for<00:03:56.799> this<00:03:56.920> round<00:03:57.250> and<00:03:57.459> that's<00:03:57.970> finishing<00:03:58.599> off

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810
