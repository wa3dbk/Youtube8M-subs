00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:13.639
 hello everyone recently bought myself introduced 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:16.320
 longus helmets for workers modelc helios 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.990
 its cost was about 17 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.900
 dollars this size as you see already 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:26.640
 This is 58 62 centimeters green helmet 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.390
 why exactly this color chose itself 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.989
 because i have a black bike 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.219
 green track 3 500 model and 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.840
 respectively 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:40.980
 picked up the credentials wanted while the decanter 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:45.620
 account here and so she was packed here 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.620
 so moved packaging means everything itself 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.280
 this is from inexpensive 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:00.690
 snowflake and almost find it later 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:06.820
 read here so it looks like a helmet 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:13.409
 20 holes on it 264 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:13.409
 frame west ie it is not heavy 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.159
 on top we pour all the plastic 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:34.750
 not very expensive helmet and cons of course 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:39.659
 Yes, in some places it does not offer a lot 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:42.630
 this plastic which we glue on top 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:48.460
 foam base 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:50.590
 the visor on it is also regulated under 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.280
 head of course looked tried 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.200
 put on 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.890
 great fit regulated 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:00.549
 cool of the downsides but what is it possible 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.289
 note that the lack of nets us 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.430
 front openings ie this 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:07.750
 insect here here we have to fly and 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.630
 it will look from here pretty 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.660
 problematic if it's going to be somehow 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:18.390
 bitchy for a second we can jump 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.390
 I think it's all solved 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.000
 then do something here stubbing 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.000
 reticulum 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:40.420
 what this helmet competition looks like 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:44.189
 model helios well thank you all for 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.189
