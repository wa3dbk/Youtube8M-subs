boss<00:03:31.879> we<00:03:32.269> use<00:03:32.419> seven<00:03:33.049> of<00:03:33.199> them<00:03:33.440> man<00:03:34.430> that<00:03:34.730> was<00:03:34.849> a

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879 
boss we use seven of them man that was a

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:36.699 
boss we use seven of them man that was a
pushover<00:03:35.269> damn<00:03:35.690> right<00:03:35.930> I<00:03:35.959> think<00:03:36.169> that<00:03:36.319> was<00:03:36.530> a

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
pushover damn right I think that was a

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.500 
pushover damn right I think that was a
little<00:03:37.129> bit<00:03:37.340> of<00:03:37.430> an<00:03:37.519> overkill<00:03:37.909> rather<00:03:38.239> than<00:03:38.449> a

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
little bit of an overkill rather than a

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.119 
little bit of an overkill rather than a
pushover<00:03:38.840> I<00:03:39.019> think<00:03:39.349> we<00:03:39.769> kind<00:03:39.949> of<00:03:40.069> just

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:40.129 
pushover I think we kind of just

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:42.490 
pushover I think we kind of just
demolished<00:03:40.819> them<00:03:41.030> but<00:03:41.209> there<00:03:41.389> we<00:03:41.510> go<00:03:41.750> that<00:03:42.290> is

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
demolished them but there we go that is

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.289 
demolished them but there we go that is
how<00:03:42.650> that<00:03:42.709> works<00:03:42.889> oh<00:03:43.310> let's<00:03:43.489> try<00:03:43.669> the<00:03:44.269> other

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
how that works oh let's try the other

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.059 
how that works oh let's try the other
single-player<00:03:45.049> mission<00:03:45.349> and<00:03:45.530> we'll<00:03:45.680> go<00:03:45.829> raid

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
single-player mission and we'll go raid

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:48.129 
single-player mission and we'll go raid
somebody<00:03:46.459> in<00:03:46.639> multiplayer<00:03:47.449> with<00:03:47.750> just

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:48.139 
somebody in multiplayer with just

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:50.349 
somebody in multiplayer with just
helicopters<00:03:48.829> and<00:03:49.489> it<00:03:49.609> should<00:03:49.790> be<00:03:49.940> pretty<00:03:50.180> easy

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:50.359 
helicopters and it should be pretty easy

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:54.189 
helicopters and it should be pretty easy
again<00:03:50.919> this<00:03:51.919> one<00:03:52.220> is<00:03:52.250> gonna<00:03:52.760> be<00:03:52.849> super<00:03:53.479> easy<00:03:53.690> oh

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:54.199 
again this one is gonna be super easy oh

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:57.250 
again this one is gonna be super easy oh

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
no he's got an air defense there or this

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.599 
no he's got an air defense there or this
one<00:03:57.470> okay<00:03:58.159> this<00:03:58.340> could<00:03:58.519> be<00:03:58.669> interesting<00:04:00.609> as

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
one okay this could be interesting as

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.039 
one okay this could be interesting as
long<00:04:01.819> as<00:04:01.940> we<00:04:02.060> take<00:04:02.239> that<00:04:02.269> first<00:04:02.659> one<00:04:02.840> out<00:04:02.930> you

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:05.259 
long as we take that first one out you
know<00:04:03.169> what<00:04:03.379> I<00:04:03.409> still<00:04:03.829> think<00:04:04.220> all<00:04:04.579> helicopters

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269

know what I still think all helicopters
could<00:04:05.720> probably<00:04:05.989> do<00:04:06.290> this<00:04:06.470> should<00:04:07.040> we<00:04:07.099> try<00:04:07.340> it

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
could probably do this should we try it

00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:21.419 
really cool we just got like a line of

00:07:21.419 --> 00:07:23.269 
really cool we just got like a line of
helicopters<00:07:22.080> just<00:07:22.379> going<00:07:22.589> beast<00:07:22.860> on<00:07:23.129> all

no helicopters have been taken down yet
I<00:07:28.379> think<00:07:28.680> this<00:07:28.800> was<00:07:28.979> completely<00:07:29.550> overkill

00:07:30.439 --> 00:07:30.449 
I think this was completely overkill

00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:32.329

he's<00:07:30.839> got<00:07:30.990> that<00:07:31.110> one<00:07:31.439> air<00:07:31.710> defense<00:07:31.740> in<00:07:32.249> the

00:07:32.329 --> 00:07:32.339 
he's got that one air defense in the

00:07:32.339 --> 00:07:33.679 
he's got that one air defense in the
center<00:07:32.819> there<00:07:32.999> but<00:07:33.149> I<00:07:33.210> didn't<00:07:33.479> really<00:07:33.599> think

00:07:33.679 --> 00:07:33.689 
center there but I didn't really think

00:07:33.689 --> 00:07:36.019 
center there but I didn't really think
it<00:07:34.199> would<00:07:34.439> do<00:07:34.559> enough<00:07:34.889> to<00:07:34.919> take<00:07:35.309> out<00:07:35.520> all<00:07:35.759> of<00:07:35.819> my

00:07:36.019 --> 00:07:36.029 
it would do enough to take out all of my

00:07:36.029 --> 00:07:39.739 
it would do enough to take out all of my
helicopters<00:07:36.839> but<00:07:37.379> it<00:07:37.469> kind<00:07:37.889> of<00:07:38.009> has<00:07:38.219> done<00:07:38.749> this

00:07:39.739 --> 00:07:39.749 
helicopters but it kind of has done this

00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:42.980
