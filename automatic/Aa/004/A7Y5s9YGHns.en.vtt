00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:27.300 

that's<00:01:08.799> packaging<00:01:09.460> I<00:01:09.640> believe<00:01:25.890> just<00:01:26.890> shipping

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
that's packaging I believe just shipping

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.660 
that's packaging I believe just shipping
information<00:01:28.890> leave<00:01:29.890> this<00:01:30.189> cost<00:01:30.700> about<00:01:32.670> five

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
information leave this cost about five

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.730 
information leave this cost about five
dollars<00:01:34.679> but<00:01:35.679> with<00:01:35.829> shipping<00:01:36.280> it<00:01:36.759> adds<00:01:37.119> up<00:01:37.420> to

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
dollars but with shipping it adds up to

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.839 
dollars but with shipping it adds up to
13<00:01:38.740> almost<00:01:39.219> 14<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:41.200> this<00:01:41.229> is<00:01:41.649> a<00:01:41.679> replica<00:01:42.069> of<00:01:42.399> the

00:01:42.839 --> 00:01:42.849 
13 almost 14 so this is a replica of the

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:50.190 
13 almost 14 so this is a replica of the
35<00:01:43.539> gallon<00:01:45.659> they<00:01:46.659> have<00:01:47.020> an<00:01:47.439> actual<00:01:48.119> 35<00:01:49.119> and<00:01:49.450> a

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
35 gallon they have an actual 35 and a

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.899 
35 gallon they have an actual 35 and a
65<00:01:50.860> and<00:01:51.280> 95<00:01:52.319> however<00:01:53.319> those<00:01:54.099> are<00:01:54.340> harder<00:01:54.879> to

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
65 and 95 however those are harder to

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:06.730 
65 and 95 however those are harder to
get<00:01:55.299> so<00:01:56.700> decided<00:01:57.700> to<00:01:57.789> get<00:01:57.879> the<00:01:58.000> $5

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740
