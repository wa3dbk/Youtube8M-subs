00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.990
 daily shrimp 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:09.610
 yo guests a whole day 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.200
 good day everyone it's tuesday again 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.670
 And that means it's time for one 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.990
 new facts video and I have it 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.609
 agree world record but darling it 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.710
 had ever considered it costs for food 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:19.090
 no, so this is the time and so 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.680
 we start with the longest loaded ever 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.530
 made real about anyway not that is here 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.910
 made in the Netherlands by 40 knotters and 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.400
 they have a roulade together 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.430
 knotted and he became no less than 100 55 meters 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.289
 long and it was made December 23, 2012 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.489
 but it is not official, if you please 

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:35.199
 course themselves have said that a 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.699
 world record was because they don't think so 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:37.270
 that there is someone who has a longer roulade 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:38.920
 has made 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.329
 but it is therefore not officially in it 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.729
 guinness book of world records 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.199
 and in addition it is in 2011 and italy and 

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:45.309
 largest mortadella in the world 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:47.649
 made and then there is a count 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.389
 Italian sausage and cooked sausage and 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:50.409
 which tastes best sliced thin so 

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:52.089
 probably the chest is not 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:54.129
 ate what forms there as much as possible 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:55.899
 200 kilos of course there was awfully 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.549
 proud in size and then what it is thin 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:58.899
 sliced tastiest tastes is not 

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:59.859
 really easy to do with a sausage van 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:00.909
 200 pounds 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:02.620
 so it's probably not finished 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:04.210
 driven you may know one 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.530
 was a game of hot dog food 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.820
 pretty popular and i don't know if it 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.740
 nowadays often heard name but 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.110
 2007 is the record set by Jerry 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.800
 chess with the record or hot dog food in it 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.190
 12 minutes, 59 are 59 hot dogs in 12 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.840
 minutes 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.130
 holy shit you have to want that 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.810
 there are on average about five per 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.860
 minute and that is quite reasonable 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.720
 they simply slide in and on 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.070
 while there you get full and then stay 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.870
 you just eat and that doesn't seem to me 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.040
 really healthy but apparently the so one 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.840
 wild record for 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.770
 911 out of belt and apparently there is also 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.420
 a world record for the most 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.300
 eat meatball in one minute 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.340
 tokyo kobe jacket Aug 29 ball of the 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.720
 ikea that yes so maybe 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.340
 tastes is very dirty i don't know 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.020
 but at least 29 Aug bal and e 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.850
 minute by reversing kobe ​​jacket and that 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.890
 was the competitor of joy chesnutt and 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.690
 joy chesnutt who has opted for 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.970
 master hotdogs in 12 minutes on his 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.230
 59 supporters piece as just mentioned but 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.820
 This was so competition has too 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.710
 participated in the same competition 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.909
 and then he decided to 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.140
 really is going on somewhere else 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.840
 focus and were meatballs 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.490
 treat buy jacket in a 29 minute 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.810
 and most of them were in one 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.210
 minute we go to a big meatball 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:08.379
 namely 5 dog and 3 kilos in the world 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:11.110
 no less than 500 3 kilos 500 3 kilos for 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:13.090
 big paul 500 and three kilos and the 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.370
 diameter was only one meter 38 that is 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.870
 actually quite small when she thinks about that 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.129
 that weighs 500 and three pounds 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.690
 but it really is such a meatball 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.970
 according to the legal requirement 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.100
 prepared in america on St jans and 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.720
 counts festival in 2011 and from 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.130
 america just straight on to belgium 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.510
 there is namely the longest salami ter 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.400
 world made and believe it or not that 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.460
 it is longer than a kilometer 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.230
 11 feels and 52 meters and 16 centimeters 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.940
 long holy shit that is quite long 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.070
 salami and like that on the centimeter 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.900
 accurately measured then that is 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.610
 pretty good but that is how long it is and 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.140
 this is officially world record 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.920
 namely in the guinness book of world 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.840
 records 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.150
 is always past the salami in the world 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.250
 named and besides that he was already long 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.870
 also very heavy indeed 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.520
 more than 2,000 kilos namely 2171 comma 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.550
 thirty seven pounds 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.080
 and that is quite heavy but good that 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.920
 is therefore an image record and ours 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.180
 record not 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.770
 and then after a world record that we do 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.900
 wrist names have the largest ones 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.180
 croquette world holy shit who is one 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.560
 made here in the netherlands in 2007 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.150
 made and croquettes manufacturer of 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.820
 and it is a very special one 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.350
 namely copy 250 kilos and he is 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.050
 more than a meter and a half tall and he 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.210
 was fried in a special suit but 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.430
 twelve hundred liters of frying fat 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:27.010
 that's 600 of those giant bottles 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.330
 with frying fat that is quite a lot 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.010
 This is between want to record for us 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.350
 Dutch and all those world records 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.910
 about eating food or gigantic food 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.830
 we are going to cut meat products 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.440
 because that is what you want and is 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.790
 set on November 26 , 2013 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.400
 And that is never done by Spaniard 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.080
 borneo ramos and it's not how much 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.940
 meat you cut but for how long you have it 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.640
 He cuts namely in 33 hours 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.459
 just cut for 33 hours 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.019
 just in meat well just 33 hours and okay 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.810
 he works and meat industry so he is 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.820
 used to that but still 33 hours in meat 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.140
 mean that you should just want to have 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.820

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.260

 then proceed immediately to the most expensive 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.640
 namely the world that becomes hamburg 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.620
 Made in America It is also not possible 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.810

 5000 dollars yes a bottle of wine that 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.060
