00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:13.590
 hi to all lovers of gattas fans 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.960
 Andreas and himself would talk about the very 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.619
 fast SUVs in gta san rise 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.289
 and so he is near this one 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.529
 satellite dish only here more 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.590
 you are nowhere and so forth so I arrived 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:36.360
 to place satellite dish here it is on 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:40.469
 map, and so we hit the road here here 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:44.880
 here so well here we sit in this car 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.300
 back called the king of sand 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.960
 So 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.550
 pretty fast yours 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.280
 so now turn off the cheat code on 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.570
 have skinny cars 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.860
 be so 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.650
 rarely ride 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.170
 So 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.280
 we leave 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.830
 from with this place 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.130
 and try 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.770
 go to the track to be honest during the descent 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.370
 from the mountain and this car feels very 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.630
 easy 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.740
 besides here is the topic of SUVs which 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.180
 go to San Andreas 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.800
 lead your failures and communities before 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.060
 nobody and the police 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.060
 road builders they look like 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.230
 I'll try somewhere to eat 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.720
 accelerate and see what kind 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:44.820
 the speed of this car is like that 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:48.850
 now try it so i try 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:54.130
 disassemble our car before it drifts 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:56.259
 can do that two times three 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.500
 yes now let's see what speed on 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:03.909
 Maxim come out and then you can do it yourself 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:10.539
 check I probably threw you a link 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:12.810

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.810
 speedometer 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.860
 in general, keep everything in my steppe to 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:27.349
 metro did meters per hour in my 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:27.349

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.770

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.060

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.989
 there will not be then two days for two issues 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:52.040
