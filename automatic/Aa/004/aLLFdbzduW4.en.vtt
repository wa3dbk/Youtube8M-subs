00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
batter coating or breaded coating if the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.250 
batter coating or breaded coating if the
chicken<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.610> whole<00:01:11.909> muscle<00:01:12.180> or<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.659> reformed

chicken is whole muscle or a reformed

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.230 
chicken is whole muscle or a reformed
chicken<00:01:13.560> piece<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.220> chicken<00:01:14.670> was<00:01:14.700> real

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
chicken piece the chicken was real

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.749 
chicken piece the chicken was real
chicken<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.990> chicken<00:01:16.380> itself<00:01:16.560> was<00:01:17.220> tender

chicken the chicken itself was tender

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.420 
chicken the chicken itself was tender
and<00:01:17.790> moist<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.659> so<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.530> idea<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.070> give

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
and moist and so the idea is to give

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.249 
and moist and so the idea is to give
like<00:01:20.759> an<00:01:20.909> accurate<00:01:21.299> description<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:22.110> the

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
like an accurate description of the

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.630 
like an accurate description of the
sandwich<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.920> consumer<00:01:23.340> can<00:01:23.369> choose

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
sandwich so that the consumer can choose

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.550 
sandwich so that the consumer can choose
for<00:01:23.820> themselves<00:01:23.939> whether<00:01:24.390> or<00:01:24.540> not<00:01:24.659> after<00:01:25.409> good

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
for themselves whether or not after good

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.740 
for themselves whether or not after good
emerges<00:01:25.950> absolutely<00:01:26.909> because<00:01:27.060> some<00:01:27.420> people

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
emerges absolutely because some people

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.510 
emerges absolutely because some people
like<00:01:27.900> heat<00:01:28.290> some<00:01:28.740> people<00:01:29.009> like<00:01:29.159> really

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520
