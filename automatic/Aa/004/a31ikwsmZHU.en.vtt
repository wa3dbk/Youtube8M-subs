00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
team we work titled all afternoon I

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.479 
team we work titled all afternoon I
think<00:02:42.750> we<00:02:42.810> deserve<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.200> three<00:02:43.380> points<00:02:43.739> they

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
think we deserve the three points they

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.160 
think we deserve the three points they
like<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.700> get<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.120> goal<00:02:45.269> as<00:02:45.450> well<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:45.989> think

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
like to get the goal as well and I think

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.720 
like to get the goal as well and I think
its<00:02:46.470> massive<00:02:46.799> three<00:02:46.980> points<00:02:47.280> for<00:02:47.430> isn't

settled<00:04:10.880> and<00:04:11.150> very<00:04:11.330> quickly<00:04:11.570> and<00:04:11.930> this

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
settled and very quickly and this

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.250

the place that no leadership is low look

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:18.970 
the place that no leadership is low look
at<00:04:17.450> other<00:04:17.600> teams<00:04:17.930> on<00:04:18.140> me<00:04:18.260> man<00:04:18.410> united<00:04:18.830> could

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 
at other teams on me man united could

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.280 
at other teams on me man united could
change<00:04:19.250> you<00:04:19.459> know<00:04:19.580> 56<00:04:19.910> games<00:04:20.390> 12<00:04:20.780> in<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.080> table

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
change you know 56 games 12 in the table

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.620 
change you know 56 games 12 in the table
that's<00:04:21.769> probably<00:04:22.070> not<00:04:22.250> good<00:04:22.460> enough<00:04:22.700> of<00:04:23.180> a

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
that's probably not good enough of a

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.840 
that's probably not good enough of a
manager's<00:04:24.140> Crystal<00:04:24.560> Palace<00:04:24.890> maybe<00:04:25.130> they<00:04:25.400> all

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
manager's Crystal Palace maybe they all

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.220 
manager's Crystal Palace maybe they all
that<00:04:26.060> all<00:04:26.240> the<00:04:26.360> teams<00:04:26.630> they<00:04:26.810> want<00:04:26.990> to<00:04:27.110> do

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
that all the teams they want to do

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.350 
that all the teams they want to do
better<00:04:27.380> and<00:04:27.620> our<00:04:27.920> fencing<00:04:28.550> off<00:04:28.670> the<00:04:28.850> six<00:04:29.120> games

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
better and our fencing off the six games

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.320 
better and our fencing off the six games
that<00:04:29.570> one<00:04:29.720> was<00:04:29.900> probably<00:04:30.350> the<00:04:30.500> top<00:04:30.680> 10<00:04:31.120> and<00:04:32.120> I

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
that one was probably the top 10 and I

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.880 
that one was probably the top 10 and I
think<00:04:32.390> if<00:04:32.750> you<00:04:32.900> look<00:04:33.050> at<00:04:33.200> the<00:04:33.320> games<00:04:33.560> was

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
think if you look at the games was

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.330 
think if you look at the games was
always<00:04:34.220> close<00:04:34.520> wasn't<00:04:34.910> it<00:04:35.470> Newcastle<00:04:36.470> 85th

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
always close wasn't it Newcastle 85th

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.490 
always close wasn't it Newcastle 85th
minute<00:04:37.490> we<00:04:37.730> scooped<00:04:37.970> shoots<00:04:38.660> horror<00:04:38.930> when<00:04:39.170> and

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
minute we scooped shoots horror when and

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.380 
minute we scooped shoots horror when and
then<00:04:39.650> the<00:04:40.040> one<00:04:40.370> minute<00:04:40.640> later<00:04:40.820> they<00:04:41.090> score

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
then the one minute later they score

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.290 
then the one minute later they score
west<00:04:42.230> bromwich<00:04:42.380> the<00:04:42.680> same<00:04:42.920> chelsea<00:04:43.520> although

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
west bromwich the same chelsea although

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.500 
west bromwich the same chelsea although
that<00:04:44.870> was<00:04:45.020> probably<00:04:45.380> not<00:04:45.560> as<00:04:45.770> easy<00:04:46.180> but<00:04:47.180> we<00:04:47.330> did

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
that was probably not as easy but we did

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.540
