on<00:04:52.590> here<00:04:52.800> to<00:04:53.220> the<00:04:53.310> point<00:04:53.550> that<00:04:53.639> you<00:04:53.790> can't<00:04:54.000> take

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
on here to the point that you can't take

break<00:04:55.710> the<00:04:56.010> case<00:04:56.190> but<00:04:57.200> the<00:04:58.200> screen<00:04:58.620> protector

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
break the case but the screen protector

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.159 
break the case but the screen protector
think<00:05:00.030> about<00:05:00.150> it<00:05:00.330> is<00:05:00.419> sometimes<00:05:00.750> when<00:05:00.930> I<00:05:00.960> touch

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
think about it is sometimes when I touch

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.100 
think about it is sometimes when I touch
a<00:05:01.200> button<00:05:01.470> stuff<00:05:01.979> sometimes<00:05:02.639> it<00:05:02.760> doesn't<00:05:03.000> work

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
a button stuff sometimes it doesn't work

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.159 
a button stuff sometimes it doesn't work
but<00:05:04.310> it's<00:05:05.310> pretty<00:05:06.090> rare<00:05:06.330> like<00:05:06.570> so<00:05:06.870> that's<00:05:07.080> when

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
but it's pretty rare like so that's when

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:08.690 
but it's pretty rare like so that's when
I<00:05:07.229> think<00:05:07.380> like<00:05:07.530> this<00:05:07.650> is<00:05:07.830> slide<00:05:08.039> I<00:05:08.070> won't<00:05:08.370> slide

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
I think like this is slide I won't slide

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.659 
I think like this is slide I won't slide
but<00:05:09.630> it's<00:05:09.930> not<00:05:10.169> really<00:05:10.590> an<00:05:10.860> issue<00:05:11.100> it<00:05:11.490> works

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
but it's not really an issue it works

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:14.060 
but it's not really an issue it works
pretty<00:05:11.940> well<00:05:12.380> the<00:05:13.380> thing<00:05:13.530> about<00:05:13.590> the<00:05:13.770> buttons

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
pretty well the thing about the buttons

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.250 
pretty well the thing about the buttons
on<00:05:14.220> the<00:05:14.310> side<00:05:14.490> though<00:05:14.760> is<00:05:14.940> that<00:05:14.970> smell<00:05:15.870> one<00:05:16.169> of

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
on the side though is that smell one of

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:27.279 
on the side though is that smell one of
my<00:05:16.320> only<00:05:16.500> complaint<00:05:16.919> is<00:05:24.919> this<00:05:25.919> mute<00:05:26.550> button<00:05:26.610> is

pretty difficult to get to you have to

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.360 
pretty difficult to get to you have to
use<00:05:30.300> your<00:05:30.330> fingernail<00:05:30.900> and<00:05:31.160> the<00:05:32.160> home<00:05:32.340> button

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:34.349 
is pretty easy it can do it one finger

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:36.020 
is pretty easy it can do it one finger
but<00:05:34.500> I<00:05:34.560> kind<00:05:34.919> of<00:05:34.950> have<00:05:35.070> to<00:05:35.099> reach<00:05:35.400> for<00:05:35.430> it<00:05:35.820> I
