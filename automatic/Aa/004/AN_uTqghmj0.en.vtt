00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:03.789
 Dr 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:13.999
 Hello in this video I want to show him how we get out of any one 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:18.390
 Text files thus increase from any programs 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.390
 one day 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.119
 what could this be useful for now a service is also allowed though 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.439
 nobody is logged in to the PC for example because we have a windows XP 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.480
 or want to use as a server and the computer itself does not have one 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.219
 Keyboard or has a screen or a house we 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.610
 So we can not log in so easily 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.530
 Nevertheless, a particular program must be started regularly each time 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.600
 you could also work on cleaning 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.379
 from a service before the user has to log in 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.430
 a-tec we already have it in another video center video he 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:55.179
 addressed 

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:59.949
 It was about creating your own bed instead of a very specific one 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:02.949
 but still have simple things done automatically 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.230
 So here would be a continuation of this 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.750
 Welsh the command 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.920
 just into a service and almonds so the import around has always started 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.620
 becomes 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.850
 demonstrate if I use the whole of this ZMP 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.460
 exe files that I have created more 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.320
 that's basically a world star part summer also in a video on 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.210
 As simple as the Daily Show, his bet on debt was an exe file 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.250
 and that's exactly what I did 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.150
 And now of course I do not want that this city is quasi as 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.850
 Service is called 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.659
 that would not work that way 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.149
 that's why I converted it to an exe file 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.500
 I can now easily call the exe file 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.230
 even if that's what I'm saying now 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.630
 what this exe file does not necessarily make much sense here 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.190
 It shows us that it just works 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.620
 and I warp a new drive RP so to speak the souks command 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.500
 run and this drive 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.430
 Spielberg they were the same content again now they stop explaining 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.110
 otherwise the drive c et al 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.379
 represents 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.749
 as we did with substance raise if you other video center 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:18.189
 www already shown 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:21.329
 not always well back programmed Tunis 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.620
 under a 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.620
 Manet sees the change 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.449
 The whole thing is terribly easy here 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:37.619
 open a console that is still really starting 

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:38.889
 To run 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:40.489
 under the sea 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:41.859
 Hoffmann line 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:44.859
 CMD a move by hand 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.049
 - point to pick Red 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.029
 so offers with its FC to the service 

00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:55.729
 then Krienke 2 was wanting to create one 

00:02:55.729 --> 00:03:01.139
 to move name of the service is in this case May Soest 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.459
 you can be free 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.670
 then choose next 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.469
 Billen 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:09.679
 I stay 

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:12.729
 It is important that we set a dial tone here 

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:13.629
 and now 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:15.019
 quotation marks 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.770
 and now she did 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.770
 to our party that is SID 

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:21.539
 path/ 

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:23.849
 programs 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:26.729
 Come get a button Complete the car 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:29.469
 Turin 

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:32.089
 May so Kast 

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:35.089
 c meet AXA has called itself that 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.139
 Hornbach normal case signs 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:40.209
 on the one hand, more start 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:41.180
 equal 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.999
 and again a question mark author 

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:47.889
 Wyse dial tones are pretty important so again SC for Serviced Create 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:48.370
 For 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.679
 we imagine that is so 

00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:51.780
 my son is 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.939
 the name of the server in quotes 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:56.959
 as in the case if a space and 1 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.089
 then bees become Abbas 

00:03:59.089 --> 00:04:00.870
 So Bendorf same 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.619
 Free-dial quotes then the complete ride 

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:08.959
 Quotes at the end then again show free instead of offended dial tone 

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:10.829
 he now knows what a 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.019
 if the bread or car is here 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.210
 that is the country 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.680
 be started automatically 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.239
 particularly important 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.389
 behind it back 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.779
 if everything is correct then it is here 

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:26.610
 the message it counts so Versailles 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.430
 Credit service successful 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.430
 because something very shortly we confirm click on Start 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:35.979
 we give our control panel 

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:42.029
 looking at the very end after self-administration 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:46.900
 to open 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.960
 then we have services 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.830
 sometimes have to 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.499
 Sony should round m 

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:56.069
 May be visited 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:58.559
 there it is 

00:04:58.559 --> 00:05:00.689
 Double click on it 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:04.050
 for the description of Tillich no negotiators also no entered 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.550
 Vehicle change that must now ago voices extent deliberately wrong 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:08.830
 given respectively 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.669
 Of course it will not run our exe file 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:14.719
 and instead of automatic 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:18.319
 so that did not specify correctly then you could theoretically what now 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:20.610
 still change here 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.180
 because this status is finished where that does not matter 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.569
 up here the 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:29.160
 So let's say what should happen when our applications 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.509
 can not be started the first time 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:34.639
 By default, nothing is done then I could do it though 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:37.650
 say so good again 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.839
 try the whole as a program 

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:42.699
 to run or restart the computer 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:44.729
 I could do that too 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:48.559
 However, that's nothing specific for the ministry in everyone 

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:49.610
 want to set up 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.650
 and of course that applies to all services 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.220
 For sure, having to quit has been successfully installed as our services 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.860
 So states expect new and control 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:08.719
 and if it works 

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:13.479
 then we should automatically after the restart here again our pm 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:15.539
 Have letters as a drive 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:18.699
 I'll take it out for a second 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:21.619
 dampening to the point 

00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:24.529
 that lies 

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:27.069
 when is the right movie? 

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:29.539
 m the 85th 

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:32.539
 popular 

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:36.900
 10 b 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.169
 even 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:39.750
 Question mark like that
