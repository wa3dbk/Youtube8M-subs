00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
kind of you know we've been describing a

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.850 
kind of you know we've been describing a
sort<00:00:32.599> of<00:00:32.629> our<00:00:32.750> twisted<00:00:33.079> metal<00:00:33.200> taking<00:00:33.559> capture

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
sort of our twisted metal taking capture

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.049 
sort of our twisted metal taking capture
the<00:00:33.950> flag<00:00:34.100> but<00:00:34.340> that's<00:00:34.550> not<00:00:34.610> really<00:00:34.789> what<00:00:34.940> it

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
the flag but that's not really what it

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:36.610 
the flag but that's not really what it
is<00:00:35.120> is<00:00:35.210> we<00:00:35.480> have<00:00:35.570> seven<00:00:36.020> modes<00:00:36.200> in<00:00:36.379> the<00:00:36.440> game

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
is is we have seven modes in the game

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.590 
is is we have seven modes in the game
then<00:00:37.250> we<00:00:37.399> really<00:00:37.789> wanted<00:00:38.000> each<00:00:38.149> one<00:00:38.360> to<00:00:38.510> be

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
then we really wanted each one to be

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.330 
then we really wanted each one to be
different<00:00:39.079> you<00:00:39.230> know<00:00:39.350> and<00:00:39.649> so<00:00:39.829> this<00:00:39.980> is<00:00:40.039> one

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
different you know and so this is one

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.400 
different you know and so this is one
that's<00:00:40.520> really<00:00:40.789> team-based<00:00:41.420> and<00:00:41.750> sort<00:00:42.260> of<00:00:42.320> all

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
this class space where like Drew who's

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.060 
this class space where like Drew who's
playing<00:00:44.960> the<00:00:45.020> game<00:00:45.200> right<00:00:45.230> now<00:00:45.410> is<00:00:45.739> playing

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
medic in the version of nuke so he can

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.270 
medic in the version of nuke so he can
launch<00:00:50.630> these<00:00:51.170> taxicabs<00:00:51.800> that<00:00:51.920> you'll<00:00:52.100> see

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
launch these taxicabs that you'll see

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.979 
launch these taxicabs that you'll see
and<00:00:52.610> he<00:00:53.090> can<00:00:53.239> detonate<00:00:53.420> them<00:00:53.660> wherever<00:00:53.780> he

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
and he can detonate them wherever he

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:55.780 
and he can detonate them wherever he
wants<00:00:54.290> and<00:00:54.410> that<00:00:54.440> ring<00:00:54.739> sends<00:00:55.130> out<00:00:55.250> healing<00:00:55.520> to

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
wants and that ring sends out healing to

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:56.979 
wants and that ring sends out healing to
all<00:00:55.880> of<00:00:56.000> his<00:00:56.120> team<00:00:56.329> and<00:00:56.510> the<00:00:56.570> longer<00:00:56.870> it<00:00:56.930> sits

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
all of his team and the longer it sits

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.950 
all of his team and the longer it sits
the<00:00:57.350> more<00:00:57.380> healing<00:00:58.070> power<00:00:58.280> gives<00:00:58.730> if<00:00:59.660> he<00:00:59.809> can

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
the more healing power gives if he can

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.360 
the more healing power gives if he can
also<00:01:00.110> sort<00:01:00.410> of<00:01:00.500> team<00:01:00.710> up<00:01:00.829> with<00:01:00.950> other<00:01:01.010> players

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
people think of twist metal and really

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.179 
people think of twist metal and really
look<00:01:27.170> at<00:01:27.229> the<00:01:27.350> surface<00:01:27.590> which<00:01:27.859> is<00:01:27.950> a<00:01:27.979> lot<00:01:28.159> of

look at the surface which is a lot of

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:29.709 
look at the surface which is a lot of
fun<00:01:28.459> a<00:01:28.490> lot<00:01:28.639> of<00:01:28.759> destructibility<00:01:29.329> and<00:01:29.600> stuff

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:29.719 
fun a lot of destructibility and stuff

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:32.109 
fun a lot of destructibility and stuff
like<00:01:29.779> that<00:01:29.869> but<00:01:30.499> there<00:01:30.679> really<00:01:30.920> is<00:01:31.279> especially

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
controls for modern racing controls like

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.700 
controls for modern racing controls like
you<00:04:27.360> can<00:04:27.510> drive<00:04:27.720> with<00:04:28.050> it<00:04:28.200> with<00:04:28.320> the<00:04:28.350> shoulder

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710

you can drive with it with the shoulder
pads<00:04:28.890> and<00:04:29.070> things<00:04:29.190> but<00:04:29.640> honestly<00:04:30.000> our<00:04:30.270> default

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
pads and things but honestly our default

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.240 
pads and things but honestly our default
controls<00:04:31.020> really<00:04:31.500> are<00:04:31.620> more<00:04:31.800> mapped<00:04:32.010> like<00:04:32.220> a

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
controls really are more mapped like a

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.830 
controls really are more mapped like a
shooter<00:04:32.610> because<00:04:32.790> they<00:04:33.030> happen<00:04:33.360> to<00:04:33.419> look<00:04:33.660> like

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
shooter because they happen to look like

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.540 
shooter because they happen to look like
cars<00:04:34.110> and<00:04:34.440> they<00:04:34.560> kind<00:04:34.860> of<00:04:34.919> drive<00:04:35.130> like<00:04:35.340> ours

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
cars and they kind of drive like ours

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.580 
cars and they kind of drive like ours
but<00:04:36.210> this<00:04:36.390> really<00:04:36.600> is<00:04:36.810> kind<00:04:36.960> of<00:04:37.110> more<00:04:37.290> of<00:04:37.350> a

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
but this really is kind of more of a

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.050 
but this really is kind of more of a
sort<00:04:38.220> of<00:04:38.250> a<00:04:38.340> fuck<00:04:38.550> we've<00:04:38.700> always<00:04:38.820> called<00:04:38.970> it

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
sort of a fuck we've always called it

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.520 
sort of a fuck we've always called it
like<00:04:39.180> a<00:04:39.240> fighting<00:04:39.600> game<00:04:39.630> in<00:04:39.870> vehicle<00:04:40.230> so<00:04:40.380> it's

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
like a fighting game in vehicle so it's

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.890 
like a fighting game in vehicle so it's
absolutely<00:04:41.130> a<00:04:41.310> cross<00:04:41.850> between<00:04:42.000> a<00:04:42.210> shooter<00:04:42.570> and

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
absolutely a cross between a shooter and

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:52.310 
absolutely a cross between a shooter and
a<00:04:42.960> fighting<00:04:43.350> game<00:04:43.380> and<00:04:43.740> you<00:04:43.860> know
