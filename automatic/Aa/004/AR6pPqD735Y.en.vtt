because then they'd have to come back
we<00:03:15.590> waste<00:03:15.830> a<00:03:15.950> lot<00:03:16.040> of<00:03:16.160> time<00:03:16.280> checking<00:03:17.120> and<00:03:17.450> turn

we waste a lot of time checking and turn

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.600 
we waste a lot of time checking and turn

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
and go off to the side the second one

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.910 
and go off to the side the second one
you<00:03:20.120> jumped<00:03:20.510> it<00:03:20.600> and<00:03:20.810> checked<00:03:21.230> him<00:03:21.380> and<00:03:21.680> went

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
you jumped it and checked him and went

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.890 
you jumped it and checked him and went
down<00:03:22.160> the<00:03:22.190> slide<00:03:22.670> and<00:03:23.030> they'll<00:03:23.480> sit<00:03:23.690> right<00:03:23.840> on

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
down the slide and they'll sit right on

there hanging into the slide right down

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.760 
there hanging into the slide right down
his<00:03:25.940> life<00:03:26.150> but<00:03:26.780> not<00:03:26.990> going<00:03:27.260> to<00:03:27.380> the<00:03:27.470> creek<00:03:27.650> at

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
his life but not going to the creek at

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.960 
his life but not going to the creek at
the<00:03:27.830> bottom<00:03:28.160> it<00:03:28.310> was<00:03:28.430> eight<00:03:28.580> and<00:03:28.670> a<00:03:28.730> half<00:03:28.760> feet

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.150 

so<00:03:31.970> I<00:03:32.000> knew<00:03:32.270> the<00:03:32.450> two<00:03:32.600> jumps<00:03:33.050> but<00:03:33.920> they<00:03:34.100> were

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
so I knew the two jumps but they were

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.590 
so I knew the two jumps but they were
and<00:03:34.520> I<00:03:34.580> thought<00:03:34.760> no<00:03:34.910> the<00:03:35.060> only<00:03:35.180> way<00:03:35.330> I'm<00:03:35.420> going

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
and I thought no the only way I'm going

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.820 
and I thought no the only way I'm going
to<00:03:35.660> get<00:03:35.780> him<00:03:35.930> over<00:03:36.050> this<00:03:36.320> jump<00:03:36.590> that<00:03:36.680> he's

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
to get him over this jump that he's

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.830 
to get him over this jump that he's
never<00:03:37.040> gone<00:03:37.280> over<00:03:37.340> is<00:03:37.760> to<00:03:37.880> go<00:03:38.030> too<00:03:38.090> fast<00:03:38.450> so<00:03:38.720> he

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
never gone over is to go too fast so he

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.580 
never gone over is to go too fast so he
can't<00:03:39.020> stop<00:03:40.450> but<00:03:41.450> not<00:03:41.630> so<00:03:41.870> fast<00:03:42.050> that<00:03:42.230> we<00:03:42.380> fly

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
can't stop but not so fast that we fly

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.220 
can't stop but not so fast that we fly
out<00:03:42.800> into<00:03:43.040> space<00:03:43.190> on<00:03:43.910> the<00:03:44.030> other<00:03:44.120> services<00:03:47.230> so

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
out into space on the other services so

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.570 
out into space on the other services so
we're<00:03:48.380> coming<00:03:48.590> in<00:03:48.770> it's<00:03:49.010> made<00:03:49.160> out<00:03:49.310> of<00:03:49.430> logs

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
we're coming in it's made out of logs

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.160 
we're coming in it's made out of logs
above<00:03:50.000> this<00:03:50.180> big<00:03:50.450> in<00:03:50.540> there<00:03:50.690> nailed<00:03:50.900> down

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
above this big in there nailed down

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
above this big in there nailed down
they're<00:03:51.410> not<00:03:51.440> the<00:03:51.709> kind<00:03:51.739> you<00:03:52.070> knock<00:03:52.220> off<00:03:54.190> and

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
they're not the kind you knock off and

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.920 
they're not the kind you knock off and
there's<00:03:55.400> a<00:03:55.489> red<00:03:55.640> flag<00:03:55.670> on<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:56.270> right<00:03:56.420> a<00:03:56.660> white

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
there's a red flag on the right a white

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.390 
there's a red flag on the right a white
flag<00:03:57.200> on<00:03:57.230> the<00:03:57.500> left<00:03:57.709> then<00:03:57.920> you<00:03:58.010> have<00:03:58.160> to<00:03:58.280> go

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
flag on the left then you have to go

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.420 
flag on the left then you have to go
between<00:03:58.580> the<00:03:58.850> flags<00:03:59.410> so<00:04:00.410> I<00:04:00.440> kind<00:04:00.860> of<00:04:00.920> cut<00:04:01.130> in<00:04:01.250> on

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
between the flags so I kind of cut in on

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.920 
between the flags so I kind of cut in on
her<00:04:01.520> short<00:04:01.790> approach<00:04:02.000> so<00:04:02.300> he<00:04:02.450> didn't<00:04:02.690> see<00:04:02.840> it

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
her short approach so he didn't see it

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.540 
her short approach so he didn't see it
he<00:04:03.110> was<00:04:03.260> going<00:04:03.440> too<00:04:03.620> fast<00:04:03.830> you<00:04:04.040> know<00:04:04.100> he<00:04:04.400> was

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
he was going too fast you know he was

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.250 
he was going too fast you know he was
going<00:04:04.670> too<00:04:04.850> fast<00:04:04.880> to<00:04:05.270> stop<00:04:05.300> I'm<00:04:05.720> sure<00:04:05.900> nothing

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
going too fast to stop I'm sure nothing

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:29.310 
going too fast to stop I'm sure nothing
tried<00:04:06.470> to<00:04:06.590> stop<00:04:06.860> and<00:04:07.730> he<00:04:07.820> couldn't<00:04:08.150> so<00:04:08.510> he<00:04:08.570> just

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.320 

the<00:04:30.320> good<00:04:30.530> news<00:04:30.740> was<00:04:31.040> stopping<00:04:31.910> them<00:04:32.060> rather

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
the good news was stopping them rather

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.030 
the good news was stopping them rather
abruptly<00:04:32.870> kept<00:04:33.200> them<00:04:33.350> from<00:04:33.470> going<00:04:33.650> down<00:04:33.919> the

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
abruptly kept them from going down the

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.210 
abruptly kept them from going down the
slack<00:04:34.840> so<00:04:35.840> I<00:04:35.870> thought<00:04:36.560> a<00:04:36.590> lot<00:04:36.830> to<00:04:37.010> have<00:04:37.190> a

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
slack so I thought a lot to have a

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.700 
slack so I thought a lot to have a
minute<00:04:37.580> maybe<00:04:37.729> 10<00:04:38.030> seconds<00:04:38.419> over<00:04:39.200> got<00:04:39.470> over

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
minute maybe 10 seconds over got over

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.200 
minute maybe 10 seconds over got over
the<00:04:39.860> next-to-last<00:04:40.250> jump<00:04:40.729> which<00:04:40.910> was<00:04:41.090> the

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
the next-to-last jump which was the

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.159 
the next-to-last jump which was the
other<00:04:41.330> one<00:04:41.510> top<00:04:42.229> of<00:04:42.380> the<00:04:42.440> hill<00:04:42.590> and<00:04:43.960> this<00:04:44.960> one

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
other one top of the hill and this one

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:46.630 
other one top of the hill and this one
was<00:04:45.290> made<00:04:45.440> out<00:04:45.500> of<00:04:45.650> three<00:04:45.919> three<00:04:46.160> trucks<00:04:46.430> about

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
was made out of three three trucks about

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.149 
was made out of three three trucks about
that

00:04:47.149 --> 00:04:47.159 
that

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:49.669 
that
he's<00:04:47.309> not<00:04:47.489> talking<00:04:47.699> about<00:04:48.050> it<00:04:49.050> was<00:04:49.229> about<00:04:49.469> this

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:49.679 
he's not talking about it was about this

00:04:49.679 --> 00:04:52.339 
he's not talking about it was about this
high<00:04:49.739> of<00:04:49.979> a<00:04:50.159> jump<00:04:50.399> and<00:04:51.270> it<00:04:51.419> was<00:04:51.539> about<00:04:51.749> live

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:52.349 
high of a jump and it was about live

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:53.869 
high of a jump and it was about live
through<00:04:52.529> this<00:04:52.649> rule<00:04:52.919> approach<00:04:53.309> there<00:04:53.610> was<00:04:53.729> no

00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:53.879 
through this rule approach there was no

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:55.790 
through this rule approach there was no
