using<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.660> wee-wee<00:00:15.870> pad<00:00:16.410> essentially<00:00:17.130> so<00:00:17.820> we

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
using a wee-wee pad essentially so we

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.540 
using a wee-wee pad essentially so we
need<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.570> get<00:00:18.720> him<00:00:18.900> housebroken<00:00:19.470> so<00:00:19.830> that<00:00:20.220> is

need to get him housebroken so that is

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.609 
need to get him housebroken so that is
why<00:00:20.789> he's<00:00:21.600> in<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.930> crate<00:00:22.170> we're<00:00:22.380> crate

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
why he's in the crate we're crate

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.920 
why he's in the crate we're crate
training<00:00:22.980> him<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:24.269> want<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.570> talk<00:00:24.779> about

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
training him and I want to talk about

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.870 
training him and I want to talk about
this<00:00:25.320> because<00:00:25.710> you<00:00:25.949> might<00:00:26.130> notice<00:00:26.460> it<00:00:26.640> behind

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
this because you might notice it behind

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.509 
this because you might notice it behind
Bodi<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.539> like<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:28.080> dead<00:00:28.380> pail<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:29.010> the

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
Bodi is like that dead pail and the

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.179 
Bodi is like that dead pail and the
reason<00:00:29.939> why<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.269> is<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:31.289> originally<00:00:32.009> we

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
reason why that is is that originally we

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.459 
reason why that is is that originally we
had<00:00:32.219> Bodie<00:00:32.669> in<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.000> crate<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.570> there<00:00:34.170> was<00:00:34.290> too

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
had Bodie in the crate and there was too

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.900 
had Bodie in the crate and there was too
much<00:00:34.649> room<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.190> boating<00:00:35.640> went<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.850> the

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
much room and boating went to the

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.459 
much room and boating went to the
bathroom<00:00:36.270> in<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.390> crate<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:36.960> if<00:00:37.050> your<00:00:37.200> dog<00:00:37.440> is

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
bathroom in the crate so if your dog is

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.630 
bathroom in the crate so if your dog is
doing<00:00:37.950> this<00:00:38.040> if<00:00:38.219> you're<00:00:38.370> trying<00:00:38.610> to

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
doing this if you're trying to

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.209 
doing this if you're trying to
housebreak<00:00:38.879> your<00:00:39.210> dog<00:00:39.570> crate<00:00:40.530> train<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:41.010> and

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
housebreak your dog crate train it and

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.340 
housebreak your dog crate train it and
it<00:00:42.000> goes<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.390> bathroom<00:00:42.780> up<00:00:42.930> might<00:00:43.140> be

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
it goes to a bathroom up might be

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.819 
it goes to a bathroom up might be
because<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.860> has<00:00:44.010> too<00:00:44.280> much<00:00:44.430> space<00:00:45.680> what<00:00:46.680> your

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
because it has too much space what your

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.490 
because it has too much space what your
dog<00:00:47.010> needs<00:00:47.309> it's<00:00:48.090> just<00:00:48.629> enough<00:00:48.870> room<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.260> stand

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
dog needs it's just enough room to stand

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.410 
dog needs it's just enough room to stand
up<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:49.980> be<00:00:50.070> able<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.250> turn<00:00:50.430> around<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:51.090> lie

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
up and be able to turn around and lie

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.900 
up and be able to turn around and lie
down<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.989> that's<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:52.890> that's<00:00:53.250> why<00:00:53.460> we<00:00:53.640> put

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
down and that's it so that's why we put

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.900 
down and that's it so that's why we put
that<00:00:54.570> back<00:00:55.110> there<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:56.010> Bodie<00:00:56.340> has<00:00:56.610> less

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
that back there so that a Bodie has less

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.910 
that back there so that a Bodie has less
room<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.480> since<00:00:58.079> we<00:00:58.260> put<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.620> back<00:00:58.859> there

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
room and since we put that back there

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.619 
room and since we put that back there
Bodie<00:00:59.820> has<00:01:00.120> not<00:01:00.300> had<00:01:00.570> an<00:01:00.690> accident<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:02.629> after

words if we're gonna open up the crate
that<00:02:28.470> doesn't<00:02:28.799> mean<00:02:28.920> Bodie<00:02:29.159> can<00:02:29.459> come<00:02:29.640> out

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
that doesn't mean Bodie can come out

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.000 
that doesn't mean Bodie can come out
right<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:30.750> how<00:02:30.930> we<00:02:30.989> trained<00:02:31.409> them<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.590> do<00:02:31.799> this

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
right and how we trained them to do this

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.800 
right and how we trained them to do this
it's<00:02:32.640> just<00:02:32.700> by<00:02:32.909> opening<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.360> door<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:33.659> if<00:02:33.720> he

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
it's just by opening the door and if he

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.170 
it's just by opening the door and if he
tries<00:02:34.049> to<00:02:34.079> walk<00:02:34.440> out<00:02:34.709> we<00:02:35.489> closed<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.879> door<00:02:36.060> on

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
tries to walk out we closed the door on

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.670 
tries to walk out we closed the door on
them<00:02:36.269> real<00:02:36.450> quick<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:36.810> I'll<00:02:36.900> pick<00:02:37.110> it<00:02:37.140> up<00:02:37.290> real

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
them real quick and I'll pick it up real

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:45.949 
them real quick and I'll pick it up real
fast<00:02:44.030> so<00:02:45.030> if<00:02:45.090> you<00:02:45.180> tries<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.540> come<00:02:45.660> out<00:02:45.810> up

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
fast so if you tries to come out up

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.630 
fast so if you tries to come out up
close<00:02:45.989> it<00:02:46.379> door<00:02:46.500> but<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:46.799> doors<00:02:47.099> over<00:02:47.370> now

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
close it door but the doors over now

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.190 
close it door but the doors over now
it's<00:02:47.819> completely<00:02:48.180> open<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.629> dog<00:02:48.780> is<00:02:48.959> learning

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
it's completely open the dog is learning

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.080 
it's completely open the dog is learning
so<00:02:50.099> we'll<00:02:50.250> close<00:02:50.459> it<00:02:50.489> again

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
so we'll close it again

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.610 
so we'll close it again
and<00:02:51.450> then<00:02:51.660> we'll<00:02:51.780> make<00:02:51.900> them<00:02:52.049> wait<00:02:52.230> this<00:02:52.410> time

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
and then we'll make them wait this time

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.500 
and then we'll make them wait this time
and<00:02:52.829> I'm<00:02:52.890> gonna<00:02:53.040> call<00:02:53.250> it<00:02:55.099> Bodie<00:02:56.099> here<00:02:56.940> deck
