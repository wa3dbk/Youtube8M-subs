january now basically when I think it's

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.700 
january now basically when I think it's
happening<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.020> reason<00:00:43.379> why<00:00:43.500> they're<00:00:43.680> doing

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
happening the reason why they're doing

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.500 
happening the reason why they're doing
that<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.550> because<00:00:44.700> they<00:00:44.969> want<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.270> make<00:00:45.480> sure

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
that is because they want to make sure

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.110 
that is because they want to make sure
that<00:00:45.690> all<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.170> bugs<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.770> exploits<00:00:46.920> are<00:00:47.730> you

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
that all the bugs and exploits are you

going to immediately exploit or find the

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.990 
going to immediately exploit or find the
best<00:00:51.870> way<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.170> expert<00:00:52.620> just<00:00:52.800> raid<00:00:53.070> now<00:00:53.699> they're

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
best way to expert just raid now they're

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.520 
best way to expert just raid now they're
gonna<00:00:54.090> find<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.660> they're<00:00:54.840> gonna<00:00:54.960> patch<00:00:55.260> it

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
gonna find it they're gonna patch it

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.040 
gonna find it they're gonna patch it
like<00:00:55.920> okay<00:00:56.460> prime<00:00:56.730> example<00:00:57.239> if<00:00:57.449> they<00:00:57.840> would

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
like okay prime example if they would

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.439 
like okay prime example if they would
have<00:00:58.079> done<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.649> with<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.280> photo<00:00:59.520> glass<00:00:59.850> with

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
have done that with the photo glass with

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.150 
have done that with the photo glass with
a<00:01:00.480> Theon<00:01:00.899> they<00:01:01.109> would<00:01:01.289> have<00:01:01.440> released<00:01:01.890> a

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
a Theon they would have released a

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.729 
a Theon they would have released a
normal<00:01:02.520> first<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.090> then<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.750> heart<00:01:04.229> they

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
normal first and then the heart they

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.080 
normal first and then the heart they
would<00:01:04.920> have<00:01:05.040> sorry<00:01:05.280> by<00:01:05.430> push<00:01:05.700> them<00:01:05.880> all<00:01:05.970> to

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
would have sorry by push them all to

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.670 
would have sorry by push them all to
normal<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:06.600> they<00:01:06.689> would<00:01:06.810> pass<00:01:07.049> tassel<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.650> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
normal so they would pass tassel to the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.260 
normal so they would pass tassel to the
heart<00:01:07.979> people<00:01:08.310> would<00:01:08.400> have<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.729> be<00:01:08.850> working

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
heart people would have to be working

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.060 
heart people would have to be working
for<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.630> type<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:09.900> armor<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.560> be<00:01:10.680> honest

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
for that type of armor and to be honest

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.760 
for that type of armor and to be honest
with<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.520> as<00:01:11.909> hard<00:01:12.299> as<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.479> was<00:01:12.780> on<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.560> hard
