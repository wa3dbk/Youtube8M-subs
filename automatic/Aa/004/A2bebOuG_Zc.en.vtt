hello<00:00:03.710> train<00:00:04.010> friends<00:00:04.460> it's<00:00:04.609> about<00:00:04.819> a<00:00:04.880> half

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:05.120 
hello train friends it's about a half

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.090 
hello train friends it's about a half
hour<00:00:05.300> before<00:00:05.600> train<00:00:06.170> time<00:00:06.200> I've<00:00:06.799> got<00:00:06.980> the

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:07.100 
hour before train time I've got the

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.459 
hour before train time I've got the
coffee<00:00:07.279> on<00:00:07.460> and<00:00:07.970> I<00:00:08.360> spent<00:00:08.960> the<00:00:08.990> last<00:00:09.230> hour

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:09.469 
coffee on and I spent the last hour

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:12.549 
coffee on and I spent the last hour
digging<00:00:09.830> out<00:00:10.100> transformers<00:00:10.910> and<00:00:11.750> I<00:00:11.959> assume

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559 
digging out transformers and I assume

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:13.959 
digging out transformers and I assume
there'll<00:00:12.830> be<00:00:12.860> some<00:00:13.129> more<00:00:13.250> Transformers

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:13.969 
there'll be some more Transformers

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:15.549 
there'll be some more Transformers
coming<00:00:14.299> tonight<00:00:14.600> but<00:00:14.869> I<00:00:14.959> thought<00:00:15.170> I'd<00:00:15.350> give

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:15.559 
coming tonight but I thought I'd give

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.350 
coming tonight but I thought I'd give
you<00:00:15.590> a<00:00:15.770> quick<00:00:16.119> overview<00:00:17.119> of<00:00:17.359> what<00:00:17.720> we<00:00:17.870> have

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:19.360 
you a quick overview of what we have

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.590 
you a quick overview of what we have
first<00:00:20.360> is<00:00:20.630> a<00:00:20.890> power<00:00:21.890> plant<00:00:22.310> not<00:00:23.150> sure<00:00:23.330> if<00:00:23.450> the

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 
first is a power plant not sure if the

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.680 
first is a power plant not sure if the
box<00:00:23.840> is<00:00:24.020> homemade<00:00:24.470> but<00:00:25.250> the<00:00:25.520> door<00:00:26.150> opens<00:00:26.740> the

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:28.690 
box is homemade but the door opens the

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:33.720 
box is homemade but the door opens the
busbar<00:00:29.690> is<00:00:29.930> on<00:00:30.080> the<00:00:30.200> back<00:00:31.449> tons<00:00:32.449> of<00:00:32.719> different

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
busbar is on the back tons of different

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.990 
busbar is on the back tons of different
voltage<00:00:34.730> settings<00:00:35.620> the<00:00:36.850> transformer<00:00:37.850> itself

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
voltage settings the transformer itself

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.590 
voltage settings the transformer itself
is<00:00:38.570> made<00:00:38.810> by<00:00:40.090> Jefferson<00:00:41.090> and<00:00:43.090> you<00:00:44.090> can<00:00:44.239> see<00:00:44.450> the

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
is made by Jefferson and you can see the

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.500 
is made by Jefferson and you can see the
label<00:00:44.930> right<00:00:45.050> there<00:00:46.000> that's<00:00:47.000> a<00:00:47.239> pretty

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
label right there that's a pretty

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.170 
label right there that's a pretty
interesting<00:00:48.260> setup<00:00:48.890> even<00:00:49.520> has<00:00:49.850> a<00:00:49.880> light

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
interesting setup even has a light

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.560 
interesting setup even has a light
fixture<00:00:51.110> inside<00:00:51.790> but<00:00:52.790> it's<00:00:52.940> missing<00:00:53.149> the<00:00:53.360> roof

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
fixture inside but it's missing the roof

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.020 
fixture inside but it's missing the roof
so<00:00:53.870> we'll<00:00:54.290> need<00:00:54.410> to<00:00:54.469> make<00:00:54.649> a<00:00:54.710> roof<00:00:54.950> one<00:00:55.940> of

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
so we'll need to make a roof one of

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.410 
so we'll need to make a roof one of
these<00:00:56.149> days<00:00:56.920> I<00:00:57.920> tried<00:00:58.489> to<00:00:58.610> limit<00:00:58.790> the<00:00:59.030> h-o

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
these days I tried to limit the h-o

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.830 
these days I tried to limit the h-o
transformers<00:01:00.230> but<00:01:00.350> this<00:01:00.530> one's<00:01:01.840> particularly

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
transformers but this one's particularly

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.489 
transformers but this one's particularly
interesting<00:01:03.440> because<00:01:03.469> of<00:01:03.920> its<00:01:04.070> length<00:01:04.489> and

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:05.499 
interesting because of its length and

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:11.679 
interesting because of its length and
it's<00:01:06.499> just<00:01:06.799> a<00:01:06.979> DC<00:01:07.759> only<00:01:08.709> made<00:01:09.709> by<00:01:09.950> a<00:01:10.689> company

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
it's just a DC only made by a company

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.940 
it's just a DC only made by a company
called<00:01:11.929> scintilla<00:01:14.049> then<00:01:15.049> there's<00:01:15.469> quite<00:01:15.920> a

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
called scintilla then there's quite a

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.609 
called scintilla then there's quite a
few<00:01:16.389> American<00:01:17.389> Flyer<00:01:17.630> 8bs

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
few American Flyer 8bs

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.830 
few American Flyer 8bs
I<00:01:18.679> really<00:01:19.009> like<00:01:19.189> this<00:01:19.399> transformer<00:01:20.119> this<00:01:20.689> is

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
I really like this transformer this is

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.609 
I really like this transformer this is
the<00:01:20.990> original<00:01:21.200> box<00:01:21.619> that<00:01:21.889> it<00:01:22.009> came<00:01:22.189> in<00:01:23.439> most<00:01:24.439> of

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
the original box that it came in most of

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.569 
the original box that it came in most of
them<00:01:24.829> have<00:01:25.299> circuit<00:01:26.299> breakers<00:01:26.659> and<00:01:27.429> if<00:01:28.429> you'll

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
them have circuit breakers and if you'll

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:31.569 
them have circuit breakers and if you'll
notice<00:01:28.789> the<00:01:29.770> variation<00:01:30.770> there's<00:01:31.219> a<00:01:31.310> black

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
notice the variation there's a black

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:34.239 
notice the variation there's a black
button<00:01:31.969> there's<00:01:32.869> a<00:01:33.020> red<00:01:33.560> button

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:34.249 
button there's a red button

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:38.620 
button there's a red button
there's<00:01:34.909> the<00:01:36.369> opaque

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
there's the opaque

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.240 
there's the opaque
lights<00:01:39.290> and<00:01:40.899> then<00:01:41.899> I<00:01:42.259> think<00:01:42.619> this<00:01:42.770> is<00:01:42.920> a<00:01:42.950> newer

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
lights and then I think this is a newer

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.990 
lights and then I think this is a newer
style<00:01:44.979> there's<00:01:45.979> quite<00:01:46.340> a<00:01:46.369> few<00:01:46.430> Lionel

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
style there's quite a few Lionel

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.249 
style there's quite a few Lionel
transformers<00:01:47.750> on<00:01:48.049> the<00:01:48.229> table<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:49.399> 1033<00:01:50.170> is<00:01:51.170> a

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
transformers on the table the 1033 is a

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.529 
transformers on the table the 1033 is a
favorite<00:01:51.890> of<00:01:52.159> both<00:01:52.460> Lionel<00:01:53.030> and<00:01:53.240> Marx

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
favorite of both Lionel and Marx

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.149 
favorite of both Lionel and Marx
collectors<00:01:54.310> lots<00:01:55.310> of<00:01:55.490> Marx<00:01:56.020> transformers<00:01:57.159> the

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
collectors lots of Marx transformers the

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:04.389 
collectors lots of Marx transformers the

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
12:39 the 1249 the 1209 there's just

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.240 
12:39 the 1249 the 1209 there's just
lots<00:02:04.579> of<00:02:04.819> variations<00:02:05.740> some<00:02:06.740> of<00:02:06.890> them<00:02:07.009> are

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
lots of variations some of them are

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.199 
lots of variations some of them are
trains<00:02:07.579> only<00:02:08.709> like<00:02:09.709> these<00:02:10.009> two<00:02:10.310> pictured<00:02:10.880> here

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
trains only like these two pictured here

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.660 
trains only like these two pictured here
and<00:02:11.630> then<00:02:12.410> we've<00:02:12.590> also<00:02:12.769> got<00:02:13.480> trains<00:02:14.480> and

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
and then we've also got trains and

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.300 
and then we've also got trains and
accessories<00:02:16.670> with<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.690> 4<00:02:17.930> lugs<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:18.620> a

accessories with the 4 lugs and a
circuit<00:02:19.940> breaker<00:02:20.030> a<00:02:20.510> little<00:02:21.260> bit<00:02:21.410> improved

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
circuit breaker a little bit improved

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.670 
circuit breaker a little bit improved
there's<00:02:23.180> several

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
there's several

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.780 
there's several
transformers<00:02:24.680> made<00:02:24.890> by<00:02:25.099> the<00:02:25.160> Jefferson

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790

transformers made by the Jefferson
Electric<00:02:26.180> Company<00:02:26.599> just<00:02:27.560> like<00:02:27.739> that<00:02:27.950> power

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250

plant house that I showed you first of
all<00:02:31.849> this<00:02:32.690> is<00:02:32.900> a<00:02:32.930> number<00:02:33.290> two<00:02:33.590> and<00:02:35.860> there<00:02:36.860> is

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
all this is a number two and there is

transformer<00:02:40.370> on<00:02:40.489> the<00:02:40.579> table<00:02:40.940> that<00:02:41.060> I<00:02:41.150> noticed

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
transformer on the table that I noticed

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.910 
transformer on the table that I noticed
this<00:02:42.500> one's<00:02:42.739> also<00:02:42.950> made<00:02:43.370> by<00:02:43.549> the<00:02:43.609> Jefferson

to it is a Marx rheostat you've got to

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.449 
to it is a Marx rheostat you've got to
have<00:03:11.450> power<00:03:11.750> to<00:03:12.380> this<00:03:12.560> to<00:03:12.950> be<00:03:13.040> able<00:03:13.130> to<00:03:13.280> adjust

I<00:03:14.980> don't<00:03:15.790> remember<00:03:16.210> the<00:03:16.480> number<00:03:16.870> but<00:03:17.590> I<00:03:18.490> could

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
I don't remember the number but I could

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.390 
I don't remember the number but I could
look<00:03:18.970> it<00:03:19.120> up<00:03:19.209> the<00:03:19.360> catalog

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
look it up the catalog

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.650 
look it up the catalog
one<00:03:21.760> of<00:03:21.850> the<00:03:21.940> most<00:03:22.120> colorful<00:03:23.220> transformers

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
one of the most colorful transformers

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.960 
one of the most colorful transformers
back<00:03:25.660> here<00:03:25.990> is<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:27.180> Jefferson<00:03:28.180> midget<00:03:28.720> and

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
back here is the Jefferson midget and

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.330 
back here is the Jefferson midget and
its<00:03:30.970> model<00:03:31.870> number<00:03:32.200> is<00:03:32.350> on<00:03:32.560> the<00:03:32.709> original<00:03:33.100> box

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
its model number is on the original box

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.560 
its model number is on the original box
it's<00:03:33.760> a<00:03:33.850> 535<00:03:34.720> -<00:03:35.160> 171<00:03:36.160> but<00:03:36.910> I<00:03:36.940> really<00:03:37.240> like<00:03:37.420> the

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
it's a 535 - 171 but I really like the

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:38.250 
it's a 535 - 171 but I really like the
colors

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
colors

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.130 
colors
and<00:03:38.920> again<00:03:39.430> it<00:03:39.580> has<00:03:39.610> some<00:03:39.970> alternate<00:03:40.420> voltages

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
and again it has some alternate voltages

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.470 
and again it has some alternate voltages
like<00:03:41.500> most<00:03:41.770> of<00:03:41.950> the<00:03:42.300> little<00:03:43.300> Jeff

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
like most of the little Jeff

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.350 
like most of the little Jeff
transformers<00:03:44.260> have<00:03:44.550> and<00:03:45.550> you<00:03:45.850> can<00:03:46.000> see<00:03:46.180> that

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
transformers have and you can see that

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.320 
transformers have and you can see that
they<00:03:46.510> made<00:03:46.800> transformers<00:03:47.800> for<00:03:48.330> American

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
they made transformers for American

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.390 
they made transformers for American
Flyer<00:03:49.630> and<00:03:51.540> probably<00:03:52.540> Lionel<00:03:53.110> it's<00:03:53.739> possible

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
Flyer and probably Lionel it's possible

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.210 
Flyer and probably Lionel it's possible
that<00:03:54.580> this<00:03:54.760> is<00:03:54.970> a<00:03:55.380> Jefferson<00:03:56.380> but<00:03:56.590> I<00:03:56.620> don't<00:03:56.920> I

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
that this is a Jefferson but I don't I

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.750 
that this is a Jefferson but I don't I
don't<00:03:58.030> really<00:03:58.330> know<00:03:59.580> it's<00:04:00.580> a<00:04:00.730> B<00:04:01.170> transformer

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
don't really know it's a B transformer

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.500 
don't really know it's a B transformer
I'd<00:04:03.760> have<00:04:03.940> to<00:04:04.060> do<00:04:04.180> some<00:04:04.390> research<00:04:04.720> on<00:04:04.959> that

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
I'd have to do some research on that

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.070 
I'd have to do some research on that
last<00:04:07.510> of<00:04:07.750> all<00:04:07.900> over<00:04:08.200> here<00:04:08.380> on<00:04:08.500> the<00:04:08.590> right<00:04:10.080> we've

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
last of all over here on the right we've

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.800 
last of all over here on the right we've
got<00:04:11.260> some<00:04:11.500> American<00:04:11.980> Flyers<00:04:12.280> this<00:04:13.269> is<00:04:13.600> a

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
got some American Flyers this is a

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.229 
got some American Flyers this is a
number<00:04:14.320> one<00:04:14.500> and<00:04:14.650> a<00:04:14.709> half<00:04:14.920> and<00:04:15.250> this<00:04:15.700> is<00:04:15.880> a<00:04:15.910> one

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
number one and a half and this is a one

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.590 
number one and a half and this is a one
and<00:04:16.359> a<00:04:16.450> half<00:04:16.680> B<00:04:17.709> I<00:04:18.459> couldn't<00:04:19.120> tell<00:04:19.269> you<00:04:19.419> what

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
and a half B I couldn't tell you what

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.599 
and a half B I couldn't tell you what
the<00:04:19.750> difference<00:04:20.079> is

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
the difference is

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.200 
the difference is
then<00:04:21.609> we<00:04:21.700> go<00:04:21.880> back<00:04:22.150> there's<00:04:22.600> another<00:04:23.070> flyer

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210
