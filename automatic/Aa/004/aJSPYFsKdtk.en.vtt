00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.410
 hello to everyone I'm Elijah 362 

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:07.089
 I bring this new video and this time good 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.889
 as you will be noticing our in my house 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:11.740
 I'm at fer behring's house and 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:13.419
 basically today I bring you a boxing 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.129
 of a gift that I have made a 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:17.920
 gift that I have made in my new 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.510
 personal sky sponsor of grip would come 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.720
 being that and good for those who do not know 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.070
 a grip is basically a thing that is 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.460
 use at the controls either of 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.890
 Precision three or xbox 360 to avoid 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.480
 sweat is worth you sweat less hands and 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.660
 Also good for what is being 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.219
 the grip at the time of taking control 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.429
 Well basically you are seeing that it is 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:40.899
 nothing is very thin, it takes almost nothing 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:42.999
 but I'm going to open it so you can see 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:44.920
 the things that lead and finally you 

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:48.039
 I will show how the result would end 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.469
 put on the control itself this grip on 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:53.499
 concrete is for xbox 360 as you will have 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:55.149
 observed in the box and good to see if 

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:57.609
 I can open because you always resist me 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:00.159
 and well, this is already open. 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:02.960
 I'm going to take it out one by one, I'm going 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:06.409
 to take everything out and I'll show you one 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.740
 and well, basically, these would be 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:12.560
 the gray ones themselves to see if that's 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.000
 this would be the clips themselves worth and good 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.250
 they have a touch that you already notice 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.140
 which is like sticking a little bit 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.880
 valdÃ©s sticks like a little and 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.619
 basically well, this would be what 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.780
 They come in each of the 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.340
 side of the controls may seem like a 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.280
 little complicated but nothing happens because 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.600
 inside they carry inside carry 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.909
 own instructions is worth it is this 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.560
 little piece of paper I'm not going to explain 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.300
 I will explain everything but you have good 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.700
 very easy to follow instructions 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.399
 and basically it's very easy to put 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.080
 also good, basically, as I say 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.729
 here are the flu and then 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.070
 we would have what would be the 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.380
 skate grip logos that you have here 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.600
 ok, that's how I think it's a 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.479
 squid because of the ink and so on and 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.280
 Well, there you are seeing it, that's it and 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.050
 well basically also if not you 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.090
 they like these stickers because they really 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.159
 they are just stickers to identify 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.200
 The product can also enter here 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.060
 ok how good would it be where you can 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.250
 buy this product you can enter the 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.660
 web page that is where as I say a 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.820
 more time is where you would buy the 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.620
 product and you can change is that I do not know 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.700
 if you are going to see but well you have all 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.010
 this list is worth 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.860
 all these sticker lists are worth 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.239
 to choose the logo color and things 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.540
 the style if you want green 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.400
 red yellow multicolor as you wish 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.350
 finally also good because they give us 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.970
 a small sticker is worth that you can 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.220
 paste it where you want me personally 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.380
 I 'm going to stick it for example in 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.930
 computer for example and well it is 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.060
 a sticker without more and then no longer 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.440
 takes nothing else as I say it's very 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.750
 easy to put on just follow the 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.730
 instructions do not have to paste the with 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.190
 no special glue or anything else 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.600
 remove this white part is worth and this 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.760
 same adheres to what would be 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.220
 the command the result would be like this 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.860
 is a command that already carries the flu and 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.240
 basically the final result would end 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.190
 it would be this that you are seeing that the 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.470
 command is black too but you can 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.930
 differentiate is worth for this area and for 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.910
 this area this doing as I say it avoids 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.890
 that you sweat because it really shows a lot 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.740
 and I can assure you and on the other hand 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.780
 Well, as I say , the 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.220
 fastening here you are seeing that they are 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.010
 the logos that I said that you can 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.959
 change on the web page and good 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.610
 basically this has been everything I'm going to 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.470
 leave them in the description of the video in 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.640
 the website where you can buy this 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.320
 product that the truth is that it is 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.730
 pretty cheap for what it is 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.709
 pretty good you also have to have in 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.750
 realize that as you will be seeing here is 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.180
 important is imported forgiveness from 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.920
 from america and well, sometimes there are 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.209
 have to pay a little more for what would come 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.530
 being the shipping costs but the 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:40.069
 product itself is 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.990

 questions to them the truth is that 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.540

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.520
 they answer to all the truth and nothing 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.380
