00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.569
 Hyundai y hatchback 30 not for long 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.970
 had to be alone in the company 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.000
 he made a new version with a body 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.950
 wagon versus hatchback he 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.759
 noticeably longer and therefore looks 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.550
 more solid 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.279
 This is the rare case when the wagon 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.710
 language does not turn to call barn too 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.689
 too beautiful design in my opinion 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.240
 This is the cutest car in the range 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.849
 Korean company but also competitors 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.590
 his feast for the eyes then you have pilasters and 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.870
 ford focus ii kia seed 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.850
 familiarity with the wagon must begin 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.770
 trunk is nice when so much space 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.450
 528 liters a wonderful result to 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.780
 the same if you fold the rear seats 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.239
 volume grows more than 3 times to 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.090
 one thousand six hundred and forty two liters 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.850
 in the driver's seat all in openwork 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.430
 beautiful but personally me most 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.859
 pleased unusually large stock 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.539
 space on the second row of seats in 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.539
 this segment is unlikely to be found 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.489
 car space is not if the former 30 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.850
 it was impossible to buy with diesel 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.020
 motor then the current please 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.650
 engine performance more than 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.189
 worthy with a working volume one whole 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.380
 63 pennies removed 128 horsepower 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.600
 despite the high level of force 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.620
 diesel is running yes and vibrations from 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.110
 it is not more than from gasoline 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.210
 dollars the car accelerates immediately without 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.390
 delay where the gasoline version 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.660
 already exhausted diesel famously gaining 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.450
 move 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:37.210
 still knock out at his disposal in a half 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.250
 times more torque flow 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.200
 fuel at the same time and a half times 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.800
 one hundred versts down the machine consumes 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.260
 average 6 liters of insulation worthy 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.270
 a lot of emotions cause and running 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.580
 Thirty quality car conquers 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.190
 reinforced concrete stability in the wings and 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.850
 excellent smoothness of the course of its suspension 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.170
 successfully deal with almost all 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.930
 irregularities on the way 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.420
 Manages site 30 is also quite versatile 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.090
 cleverly and without delay pass bundles 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.760
 driving turns and does not upset the driver 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.370
 lack of feedback on the steering wheel by 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.180
 enough ground clearance 15 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.990
 centimeters 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.360
 wagon ai 30 roomier and more practical 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.000
 base hatchback but no less 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.830
 stylish and therefore on Russian roads 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.830
 it should not be uncommon
