we're currently making so to begin we're
going<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.820> go<00:00:50.910> ahead<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.540> create<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:52.050> quad<00:00:52.380> and

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
going to go ahead and create a quad and

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.229 
going to go ahead and create a quad and
we're<00:00:54.690> going<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.110> position<00:00:55.380> this<00:00:55.920> quad<00:00:56.399> that

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
we're going to position this quad that

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.549 
we're going to position this quad that
we<00:00:57.360> can<00:00:57.510> see<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.809> on<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.079> bottom<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.380> our

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
we can see it on the bottom of our

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.360 
we can see it on the bottom of our
screen<00:01:00.559> and<00:01:01.559> then<00:01:01.649> we're<00:01:01.739> going<00:01:01.860> to<00:01:01.890> drag<00:01:02.160> it

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
screen and then we're going to drag it

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.810 
screen and then we're going to drag it
the<00:01:03.180> scale<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.899> X<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.190> if<00:01:05.339> those<00:01:05.520> of<00:01:05.700> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
the scale the X so that if those of the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:15.810 
the scale the X so that if those of the
whole<00:01:05.970> screen<00:01:12.530> 16<00:01:13.530> and

whole screen 16 and
we're<00:01:15.880> going<00:01:16.000> to<00:01:16.060> drag<00:01:16.270> our<00:01:16.600> graphic<00:01:17.290> on<00:01:17.440> to<00:01:17.650> it

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
we're going to drag our graphic on to it

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.490 
we're going to drag our graphic on to it
now

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
now

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.230 
now
the<00:01:20.620> material<00:01:21.190> I'm<00:01:21.490> going<00:01:21.670> to<00:01:21.729> go<00:01:21.820> ahead<00:01:21.940> and

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
the material I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.600 
the material I'm going to go ahead and
change<00:01:22.510> the<00:01:22.840> shader<00:01:23.620> from<00:01:23.920> diffuse<00:01:24.700> to

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
change the shader from diffuse to

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.520 
change the shader from diffuse to
transparent<00:01:27.900> cut<00:01:28.900> out<00:01:29.050> diffuse<00:01:31.380> we're<00:01:32.380> going

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
transparent cut out diffuse we're going

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.469 
transparent cut out diffuse we're going
to<00:01:32.590> go<00:01:32.710> ahead<00:01:32.830> and<00:01:33.250> create<00:01:33.760> a<00:01:33.850> light<00:01:34.060> so<00:01:34.330> that

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
to go ahead and create a light so that

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:42.090 
to go ahead and create a light so that
we<00:01:34.570> can<00:01:34.750> see<00:01:35.200> better<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:38.700> on<00:01:39.700> our<00:01:40.390> graphic<00:01:41.290> you

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
we can see better and on our graphic you

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.700 
we can see better and on our graphic you
want<00:01:42.280> to<00:01:42.340> make<00:01:42.460> sure<00:01:42.610> that<00:01:42.790> the<00:01:42.940> bat<00:01:43.119> mode<00:01:43.330> is

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
want to make sure that the bat mode is

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.340 
want to make sure that the bat mode is
calliope<00:01:45.479> now<00:01:46.479> we're<00:01:46.840> going<00:01:46.960> to<00:01:47.020> need<00:01:47.140> to<00:01:47.259> go

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
calliope now we're going to need to go

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.670 
calliope now we're going to need to go
ahead<00:01:47.530> and<00:01:47.619> create<00:01:47.740> a<00:01:47.860> script<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:53.530> is

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
ahead and create a script and this is

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:00.900 
ahead and create a script and this is
going<00:01:53.979> to<00:01:54.070> be<00:01:54.130> called<00:01:54.340> parallax<00:01:59.820> after<00:02:00.820> the

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
going to be called parallax after the

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.370 
going to be called parallax after the
scripts<00:02:01.149> created<00:02:01.600> open<00:02:01.960> it<00:02:02.020> up<00:02:02.140> in

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
scripts created open it up in

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:11.130 
scripts created open it up in
monodevelop<00:02:08.340> alright<00:02:09.340> so<00:02:10.239> the<00:02:10.600> only<00:02:10.750> thing<00:02:11.019> we

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.110 
monodevelop alright so the only thing we
need<00:02:11.260> to<00:02:11.320> do<00:02:11.500> in<00:02:11.620> here<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:12.220> get<00:02:12.400> a<00:02:12.459> parallaxing

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
need to do in here to get a parallaxing

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.180 
need to do in here to get a parallaxing
effect<00:02:13.420> is<00:02:15.780> we<00:02:16.780> need<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:17.050> access<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.590> renderer

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
effect is we need to access the renderer

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:25.229 
effect is we need to access the renderer
on<00:02:18.580> our<00:02:21.090> game<00:02:22.090> object<00:02:22.269> and<00:02:23.549> we<00:02:24.549> want<00:02:24.730> to<00:02:24.880> access

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
on our game object and we want to access

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.280 
on our game object and we want to access
the<00:02:25.360> material<00:02:25.870> you<00:02:26.860> main<00:02:27.130> text<00:02:27.519> your<00:02:27.640> offset

don't<00:02:41.290> care<00:02:41.590> about<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:42.010> Y<00:02:43.530> we<00:02:44.530> only<00:02:44.829> care

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
don't care about the Y we only care

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.530 
don't care about the Y we only care
about<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.400> X<00:02:46.019> and<00:02:47.910> we're<00:02:48.910> going<00:02:48.940> to<00:02:49.239> go<00:02:49.420> ahead

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
about the X and we're going to go ahead

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.800 
about the X and we're going to go ahead
and<00:02:51.390> move<00:02:52.390> this<00:02:52.750> from<00:02:53.650> time<00:02:53.980> time<00:02:54.660> over<00:02:55.660> the

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
and move this from time time over the

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.880 
and move this from time time over the
last<00:02:55.840> time<00:02:56.320> times<00:02:57.480> some<00:02:58.480> speed<00:02:58.870> we'll<00:02:59.709> call

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
last time times some speed we'll call

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:12.830 
last time times some speed we'll call
that<00:03:02.280> 5.4<00:03:06.090> okay<00:03:07.090> and<00:03:07.450> so<00:03:07.660> now<00:03:07.780> if<00:03:07.870> you<00:03:07.959> play<00:03:08.170> it

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.280 

oh<00:03:14.030> we<00:03:15.030> have<00:03:15.120> to<00:03:15.209> drag<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.599> script<00:03:15.810> on<00:03:15.959> to<00:03:16.170> the

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
oh we have to drag the script on to the

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
oh we have to drag the script on to the
game<00:03:16.440> object<00:03:17.810> so<00:03:18.810> go<00:03:18.900> ahead<00:03:19.020> and<00:03:19.140> do<00:03:19.290> that<00:03:19.319> now

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.150 

it<00:03:23.760> will<00:03:23.910> parallax<00:03:27.410> so<00:03:28.410> in<00:03:28.770> order<00:03:28.920> to<00:03:29.040> make

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
it will parallax so in order to make

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.350 
it will parallax so in order to make
this<00:03:29.250> script<00:03:29.519> a<00:03:29.580> little<00:03:29.760> more<00:03:29.849> expandable

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
this script a little more expandable

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.300 
this script a little more expandable
we're<00:03:30.599> going<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.810> go<00:03:30.900> ahead<00:03:31.019> and<00:03:31.440> create<00:03:32.190> a

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
we're going to go ahead and create a

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:44.420 
we're going to go ahead and create a
public<00:03:32.670> point<00:03:34.099> speed<00:03:35.690> or<00:03:36.690> float<00:03:38.269> speed<00:03:43.430> let's

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
public point speed or float speed let's

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:51.160 
public point speed or float speed let's
set<00:03:44.670> this<00:03:44.790> to<00:03:45.000> 0.4<00:03:47.630> replace<00:03:48.630> the<00:03:48.870> speed<00:03:49.680> here

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
set this to 0.4 replace the speed here

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.830 
set this to 0.4 replace the speed here
and<00:03:52.170> now<00:03:52.319> you<00:03:52.380> can<00:03:52.680> modify<00:03:53.130> this<00:03:53.630> from<00:03:54.630> your

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
and now you can modify this from your

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.470 
and now you can modify this from your
