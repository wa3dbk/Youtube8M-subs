 is the core powershot sx280 hs 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.230
 in the rose we naturally find the essex 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.690
 280 itself a usb cable 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.100
 a power cord battery wrist strap there 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.869
 battery charger and of course it also 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.279
 included and manual cd with 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.279
 software and warranty papers 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.589
 if we take the essex 280 watts closer 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.179
 view then we have here to the 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:32.369
 top a very large on-off button 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.920
 sit next to the shutter release and 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.110
 the search buttons below are gps 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.730
 module hidden and below is the 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.530
 Built-in flash that the electronic 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.760
 comes up there electronically 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.920
 goes downstairs 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.900
 but here we have a model at the back 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.520
 sit that volume nicely from the side 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.310
 reach with your thumb 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.240
 and who has a play button a record button and 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.220
 setting wheel 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.080
 with various function keys and display 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.450
 key and a menu key then there 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.710
 natural 3 inch display 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.870
 at the bottom we have the 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.490
 tripod connection and here you have 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.660
 including your battery and memory card 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.939
 places 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.670
 HDMI is on this side of the camera 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.590
 connection and the USB connection and on 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.720
 the front we find ta fascist here 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.000
 light two stereo microphones and 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.700
 of course the wide-angle lens with twenty 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.020
 times optical zoom and behind it the 12.1 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.020
 megapixel sensor 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.370
 the essex 280 has so-called hs 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.500
 system and this makes you very beautiful 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.240
 photos even in low light and that 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.730
 is due to the very light-sensitive sensor 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.800
 in combination with the dg processor in this 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.970
 case the new close xs processor 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.920
 making the images only extra 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.690
 beautiful words has a very good one 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.130
 automatic mode because I like that very much 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.870
 close to the mug and then we see the left 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.330
 that appears at the top of a flower 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.250
 stands for macro mode and that means 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.060
 that he just the right position himself 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.680
 has chosen 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.049
 you can of course also own various 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.440
 ceremony select one further is the 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.350
 sports mode 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.270
 it will be the object in terms of focus 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.280
 continue to follow and will always be the sharp 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.770
 take pictures but also have a scene 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.140
 booth involving the various ceremony 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.640
 can select in this case 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.310
 portrait mode 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.990
 so march there you have one and 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.460
 face recognition 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.980
 After so just as the sitting 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.860
 here some other types 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.870
 ceremony for intended under water or 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.970
 when it snows outside 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.550
 after a little further, come to the 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.260
 effects and if I am here on the 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.000
 functions at key then I can 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.290
 select effects and I have them here 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.160
 black and white example 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:35.290
 soft focus and toy camera effect or 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.060
 a miniature effect or even a de 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.710
 fish-eye effect in between you can take photos with 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.350
 give that little bit more 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.960
 also there is a discrete mode where you 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.640
 turn off all sounds from the camera and all that 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.580
 can take photos silently 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.800
 and here we have the film mode but as 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.410
 then we just go back then we find them 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.450
 here the liveview control and if i then 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.670
 press the function set button then I can 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.989
 adjust various parameters that she can 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.820
 I take a picture for example 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.810
 make it lighter and then I want the colors 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:07.300
 what is more neutral so less lively and the 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.640
 photo needs to get a little warmer and that's how you fit 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.900
 quickly becomes camera settings 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.580
 to 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.520
 for the more advanced uses 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.500
 then feel the p mode and also the various 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.480
 manual mode then fully on 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.480
 put it manually then we see that with 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.100
 this setting in this case the 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.690
 shutter speed at the anchor 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.760
 can also adjust the aperture 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.670
 when I press this button it jumps 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.560
 towards the aperture and of course you can 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.239
 I also adjust the ISO value when I am on 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.100
 the functions and button press 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.900
 no I also that as a possibility but also 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:42.250
 the flash output so the the flash power 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.320
 photo format and white balance is all 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.850

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.980

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.310
 with that you can geotag photos like 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.950
 so it's called location data 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.300
 and full HD filming is possible 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.010

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.340
