00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.579
 the new one is a very good resource for them to use 

00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:11.079
 in a marriage process 

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:15.280
 because they are very satiety especially if it is consumed by the institution 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:17.990
 I want to tell you that 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.039
 the game has very important properties high value proteins 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:22.789
 biological 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.899
 vitamins and minerals and useful fats 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:29.249
 Thus 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:30.989
 a myth that says he 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:33.660
 the game brings cholesterol 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.010
 yes it is true that it contributes cholesterol and quite 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.560
 but I want to tell you that cholesterol is entered acted organism through the 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.600
 feeding 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.830
 It absorbs by 30% what comes with high cholesterol foods 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.320
 the 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.230
 It is fundamental to increase your country you spend child 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.580
 the hierarchy saturated 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.540
 and fats 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.320
 these two holy enemies for the increase of troops hope 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.560
 what happens with the game 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.930
 the flight 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.130
 Thank you 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.260
 as I said before 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.370
 healthy lecithin 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.580
 which is one of the actresses counteracts in effect 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.510
 what it produces 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.020
 the cholesterol that brings the new 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.030
 and also if this is added more than cholesterol shahzad by 30% what 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.750
 want 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.650
 pollute passion inquires 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.580
 they are home 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.500
 Then from the forest he qualified in this case 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.020
 this is the egg you can use 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.100
 and very good 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.340
 it's an economic element that you can not use 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.560
 different preparations more healthily hard 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.790
 in guntÃ­n the shuffle in tortillas always taking into account percentage of 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.360
 fat do not use 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.630
 does that during cooking 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.170
 There is something I want to be clear if you do not have a tendency to have 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.940
 high cholesterol 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.310
 daily doors in both rain game 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.359
 it's already happened 

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:12.119
 high percentage of these 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:15.119
 in the Canary Islands without extending 

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:20.579
 the elevated cholesterol in this concept did not count a nutritionist to be 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:24.789
 make a frequency of consumption only of eggs and other foods 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:32.060
 assurant there is that increases the percentage of bad fats then in thirteen 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:35.659
 If you are making a 10-year plan 

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:39.609
 it's a good show safety says 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:40.309
 I think
