00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.849
 And then everyone's beauty here. 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.940
 bring the subject back again to 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.949
 practitioners of martial arts and a 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.920
 Last video talk a bit about the 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.180
 rescue run and how to let a little 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.029
 more powerful 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.119
 in this video I will talk about the execution 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.460
 of the river was a way of leaving a 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.550
 little more pleased kicking motion 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:46.489
 the same way the show will start there 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:46.489
 on the tip of the foot and on the leg 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.180
 so let's kick a little 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.410
 The stronger we have to work. 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.410
 all this information 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:06.630
 Then the exercise will come again. 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.189
 functional exercise adapted to the 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:15.950
 movement 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:15.950
 the same way I'm on my feet 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.490
 after tying somewhere behind 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:32.130
 me and I'm going to perform a 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:34.680
 kick making it more difficult for the 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.729
 move, I 'll put some 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:43.590
 Difficulty in the moment that I'm going to do 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:46.070
 The priest's fit is this movement. 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.070
 on here 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:59.730
 thus not being able to strengthen 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.090
 the muscles and performing the movement 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.480
 right 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:07.090
 photo such ad and we leave our pole 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.830
 the bodybuilding exercises they will 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.440
 strengthen the muscles 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.420
 it is only that the ideal is to strengthen 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.170
 muscles perform a movement of the 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.660
 kick 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.600
 comparing the movement that is most 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.000
 resembles a kick in time 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.250
 a few days we are situation would be a 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.120
 exercise that the chair extends where 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.340
 sitting with his legs in that 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.330
 position I will carry out 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.450
 the intention of the work that knee 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.450
 form 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.350
 right 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:44.770
 This way I'm going to leave the team more 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.330
 competent and stronger 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.030
 an important detail we have to 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:52.390
 to remember is that it does not only matter the 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.760
 kick him he has to be fast too 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:03:00.130
 We will not be able to put much 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:02.440
 strength again physical strength is with 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.180
 acceleration is a bit more than 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.600
 people can accelerate our mass 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.980
 the greater the impact of the kick 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.070
 calm down the damage we want 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.530
 cause another important detail of the kick 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.230
 in the initial kick time I have to take 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.530
 careful to lift the first trophy 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.650
 and why I have control is 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.400
 in the streets 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.560
 It's only I want, I can do it here today. 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.170
 I can change loudest 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.870
 I can be down I can kick 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.700
 Right front this way I can 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.280
 fool my college 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.150
 is different from what the Pope is totally 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.459
 attended 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.849
 When will we know where the fun is? 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:46.099
 What the hell is going on? 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.019
 I will not have strength nor control 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.810
 the will is only in the south during the 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:54.590
 these were some of the tips of 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.870
 audio an easy kick in martial arts 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.280
