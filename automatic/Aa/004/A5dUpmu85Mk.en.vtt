connect to the throttle body and then
the<00:00:44.219> plenum<00:00:44.899> then<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:46.020> have<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:46.410> t-shaped

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
the plenum then you have this t-shaped

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.119

show you inside inside is what's called
the<00:01:03.870> Helmholtz<00:01:04.170> resonator<00:01:07.070> it's<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.189> little

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
the Helmholtz resonator it's a little

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.640 
the Helmholtz resonator it's a little

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
valve a perv a l've you can see I'm

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.370 
valve a perv a l've you can see I'm
pushing<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.700> open<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.150> closed<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.780> changes<00:01:13.229> by

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
pushing it open and closed it changes by

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.880 
pushing it open and closed it changes by
90<00:01:13.799> degrees<00:01:14.900> and<00:01:15.900> that's<00:01:16.170> meant<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.650> change

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
90 degrees and that's meant to change

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.440 
90 degrees and that's meant to change
the<00:01:17.130> sound<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.580> car<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.060> resonance

inside<00:01:19.759> to<00:01:20.759> disable<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.360> when<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.630> take<00:01:21.810> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
inside to disable it when you take the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.499 
inside to disable it when you take the
box<00:01:22.170> off<00:01:22.439> now<00:01:22.830> turning<00:01:23.250> us<00:01:23.460> around<00:01:23.729> looking<00:01:24.390> at

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
box off now turning us around looking at

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.530 
box off now turning us around looking at
the<00:01:24.600> back<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.530> airbox<00:01:26.869> this<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:28.080> the

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
the back of the airbox this is the

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.840 
the back of the airbox this is the
vacuum<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:31.220> controls<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.630> right<00:01:33.630> here

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
vacuum that controls it right here

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.120 
vacuum that controls it right here
that's<00:01:35.850> connected<00:01:36.509> through<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:37.130> plastic

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
that's connected through this plastic

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.510 
that's connected through this plastic
straw<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:39.560> then<00:01:40.560> when<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.829> take<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.280> plant

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
straw and then when you take the plant

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.350 
straw and then when you take the plant
the<00:01:41.939> stock<00:01:42.180> airbox<00:01:42.420> off<00:01:43.520> the<00:01:44.520> solenoid<00:01:45.060> is

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
the stock airbox off the solenoid is

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.340 
the stock airbox off the solenoid is
here<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.780> unclip<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:47.369> put<00:01:47.579> a

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
here you unclip that and you put a

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.010 
here you unclip that and you put a
vacuum<00:01:49.350> plug<00:01:50.040> over<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.460> top<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.180> you

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
vacuum plug over the top of it and you

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.300 
vacuum plug over the top of it and you
detach<00:01:52.409> this<00:01:54.079> and<00:01:55.079> what<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.619> take<00:01:55.860> out<00:01:56.040> should

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
detach this and what you take out should

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.719 
detach this and what you take out should
look<00:01:56.460> exactly<00:01:56.759> like<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.329> it's<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:58.590> hose<00:01:58.860> the

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
look exactly like this it's the hose the

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.940 
look exactly like this it's the hose the
plastic<00:02:00.210> straw<00:02:00.479> is<00:02:00.659> still<00:02:00.899> attached<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.860> the

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
plastic straw is still attached to the

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.990 
plastic straw is still attached to the
valve<00:02:02.159> for<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.399> Helmholtz<00:02:02.939> resonator<00:02:03.530> and

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
valve for the Helmholtz resonator and

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.210

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
then in your engine bay what you'll be

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.919 
then in your engine bay what you'll be
looking<00:02:08.489> at<00:02:08.580> this<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:08.910> actually<00:02:09.330> an<00:02:09.450> evolution

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
looking at this is actually an evolution
