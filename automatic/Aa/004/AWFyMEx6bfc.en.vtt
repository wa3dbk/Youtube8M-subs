00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hi to all the boys and well found 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.430
 on my channel as usual I am 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.620
 I read and I 'm here today with a new one 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.690
 ex set from shown in particular 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.880
 today we have siberia b2 of the 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.360
 steelseries in white and 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.860
 co 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.379
 first of all this is a set available 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.750
 in two different white frost colors 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.039
 blue then with blue lighting and 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.029
 duties we have that black ones 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.680
 the black ones 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.539
 I personally own cobians who 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.580
 I must say that that way I am a lot 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.109
 more pussies then then if you like those 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.130
 black 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.990
 free to do it while the costs of 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.059
 shit but it's not my problem no 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.530
 joke 9 together we go to find out 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.480
 all the features all that 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.270
 in short, there is to know about this is the set 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.030
 of the steel made itself start from the headphones 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.230
 no, because the thing is headphones 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.059
 that the more you are interested in it then not 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.520
 let's talk no reality I want to start from 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.440
 boss that's why starting from the cult like 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.059
 this too we talk about this too 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.920
 end of this cable present 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.000
 a gold plated usb output but 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.800
 above all we can find that 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.199
 directly an integrated sound card 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.760
 this means that it will not be necessary 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.379
 connect our asset to an entrance 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.789
 of our sound card but we could 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.920
 quietly connect it to one 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.200
 any or any usb input 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.979
 of our computer to do it 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.210
 work 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.860
 we also can find along the cable 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.450
 also the remote control ready 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.070
 remote which gives us the possibility to 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.450
 go up and turn down the volume 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.610
 rather than going to change the 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.049
 microphone or possibly empty us 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.000
 a little square I have to say that maybe 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.619
 find a slightly tapered shape 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.509
 it would have been better I don't know why but 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.460
 they do all these damn checks 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.750
 remote in square form because not 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.450
 failed for the accused are much more 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.740
 children beyond this we can say that 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.909
 the cable length is about one 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.650
 meter so we can say a cable 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.299
 rather short in spite of this it comes to us 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.640
 also supplied with the package 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.250
 an extension of two meters this way 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.020
 maybe if we were to connect I know the 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.609
 ours is 7 in the part 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.560
 back of our computer things 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:48.149
 quite far from where we are 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.140
 we sit and therefore it would be a bit uncomfortable 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.700
 real leader of a method of being 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.320
 forced to play under the desk 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.640
 we could easily use the 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.259
 extending long while that we who 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.869
 to define rather unsightly we say 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.390
 that maybe they could have inserted one 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.390
 extends that in the part where it goes to 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.130
 connecting to could be say a 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.119
 a little more in tune could go a little 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.069
 more to resume the sound card 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.769
 integrated however let's say there is one 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.510
 USB extension cable and it doesn't have to be 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.620
 partiva mind pussy but they could do it 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.160
 maybe a little more as I said it in 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.920
 tuning 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.420
 let us now turn to the real ones I would like 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.549
 starting from the microphone as you can 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.049
 note a retractable microphone and this one 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.549
 what I really like a lot of microphone 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.530
 that it is possible to stay whenever 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.329
 both need well and in case 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.049
 maybe we should n't use it 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.640
 even give us trouble 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.739
 we can safely return 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.500
 very easy to install and 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.000
 also easy to portray from this thing 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.950
 I liked the bike and you will wonder how 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.840
 he feels like a microphone I think 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.400
 that it is useless feels good feels 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.290
 bad well could improve I do 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.790
 the most comfortable thing records 10 seconds 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.709
 clip the five seconds of audio 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.109
 feel it and take it yourself 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.209
 conclusion of how it works and how 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:54.329
 behaves the enemy of siberia v2 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.519
 test siberia microphone v2 save all 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.380
 guys and welcome to this new video 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.790
 the higher rent certainly goes to 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.380
 account distinguishes from the greater 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.480
 part of the ex and why as you can well 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.220
 note presents only a band that 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.540
 we will go to recline adapt 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.579
 perfectly our head 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.079
 and speaking of lightness we can 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.849
 quietly say that she is pretty 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:14.190
 light and therefore let's say in the lead 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.870
 even if worn for several hours 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.910
 let's say it won't give you particularly 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.440
 bother this also thanks to gods 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.880
 rather mobile pavilions I can indeed 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.739
 say a lot this wife does not 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.900
 hear them all and I must say obviously in 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.370
 head are fantastic even having 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.230
 very large pavilion so even one 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.209
 cash or really we also say the 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.480
 audio quality and soundproofing that 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.879
 will 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.640
 but it's really excellent how much they cost 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:41.220
 this is the 7 you can find it among the 60 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.129
 and the 70 euros so I think is a 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.930
 fair price and we can also say 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:46.980
 rather son I know now I say it 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.049
 just now because I didn't want to start 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.610
 the video I give guys look at 4 sofi 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.340
 league is so because if not maybe 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:56.069
 could you maybe have doubted the 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.720
 quality of this video however are 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.360
 really cool knot really like a 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.670
 lot of blue lighting we can 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.040
 that go to regulate through the same 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.840
 iversen zhang we might as well have a 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.400
 equalizer will allow us to do something 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.359
 in giving regular low high half caps 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.430
 what you want 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:15.690
 lorica pino we are therefore regulated 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.489
 guys really would say in seven 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.049
 very very complete and I liked it 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.760
 really a lot both for the microphone 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.680
 especially for the aesthetic level 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.780
 I know maybe the former is not bought because a 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.460
 aesthetic level is nice but I have to say 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.440
 and a very good summer is more 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.600
 seriously speaking it is definitely a lot 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.039
 cool when we're going to lay her down from 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.690
 some part we leave them there on 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:37.979
 our desk this lighting 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:40.320
 blue few cases are daughters and I go that 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:41.729
 he searched in the set for it to be beautiful 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.260
 not just functional this 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.210
 surely presents that this 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.669
 feature where it can be found 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.010
 but practically everywhere I noticed that 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:51.660
 to the point I told you about the kiwi I am 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.849
 two main versions of this blue frost 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.010
 and then also that well the black one with 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:58.050
 Orange lighting just like 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.300
 to people with bad taste 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.490
 but I've seen that anyway on amazon 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.720
 always at the same number 60 70 edition 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.840
 I have so many models because 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.940
 the assessor if he goes to propose several 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.400
 variations on this theme in the sense that 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:14.090
 they also exist in green color 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.090
 red orange too 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.560
 the extender dedicated to na'vi really there 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.570
 there are so many versions of this is 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.790
 therefore and there is something for all tastes 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:25.280
 I really leave you under one 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.360
 description where you can find them at me 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.220
 really liked it quite 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.430
 satisfied and in short for quite a while 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:33.229
 I think this will be the next one 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.930
 I will go to use very practical 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:37.310
 even with the usb connection of course you do 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.210
 attention that the cav is a bit short but 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.660
 however there is the will 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.580
 having said that maybe next time 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.470
 more violent so often in two and here 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.930
 I have and then there is not then who I am in 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.639
 less ok you worked with this is all me 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.590
 I showed you the Sistine Siberia b2 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:53.510
 really very fine and then anyway 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.690
 session spur also other headphones is there 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.680
 even a version you do more from the elite 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.650
 or are you to ask her if maybe a 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:03.229
 cheaper and more in time 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.700
 maybe if you were interested let me 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:07.039
 know I'll try to see if it will be 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.710
 It is possible to show them to you I would say that really 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:11.720
 everything I hope you enjoyed 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.949
 really really cool and just in case 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.800
 which you liked but above all vi 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:17.840
 enjoyed this video baam 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.880
 bombed you'll tell me I'm perfect I read 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.510
 thank you for your attention and not 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.180
 fuck around 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.470
 then something useful today ok starts 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.970
 day watching maybe this video 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.229
 it was n't very useful but he didn't mess around 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.229
 does not happen 

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:49.469
 Well
