00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.119 
so today I've decided to make these
really<00:00:32.559> pretty<00:00:33.900> beautifully<00:00:34.900> colored<00:00:35.290> marble

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.129 
really pretty beautifully colored marble

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:39.299 
really pretty beautifully colored marble
dishes<00:00:36.820> and<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:38.260> can<00:00:38.290> use<00:00:38.680> these<00:00:38.890> for

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
dishes and you can use these for

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.759 
dishes and you can use these for
whatever<00:00:39.610> you<00:00:40.059> like<00:00:40.210> really<00:00:40.840> but<00:00:41.140> I<00:00:41.350> think

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:41.769 
whatever you like really but I think

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:44.100 
whatever you like really but I think
they're<00:00:42.160> supposed<00:00:42.580> to<00:00:42.760> be<00:00:42.970> used<00:00:43.269> as<00:00:43.540> real

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
they're supposed to be used as real

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.380 
they're supposed to be used as real
dishes<00:00:44.650> anything<00:00:45.400> like<00:00:45.550> that<00:00:45.580> but<00:00:46.150> I<00:00:46.180> also

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
dishes anything like that but I also

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.360 
dishes anything like that but I also
think<00:00:46.600> they're<00:00:46.989> really<00:00:47.290> useful<00:00:47.830> to<00:00:48.010> put<00:00:48.160> your

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
think they're really useful to put your

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.119 
think they're really useful to put your
keys<00:00:48.640> in<00:00:48.970> or<00:00:49.269> anything<00:00:49.780> which<00:00:50.110> is<00:00:50.350> quite<00:00:50.800> small

block of this so as you can see I'm just

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.830 
block of this so as you can see I'm just
breaking<00:01:35.860> in<00:01:36.130> half<00:01:36.340> and<00:01:36.700> I'll<00:01:36.970> just<00:01:37.179> use<00:01:37.420> the<00:01:37.630> 1

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
block of that I'll roll it into a long

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.089 
block of that I'll roll it into a long
snake<00:01:41.470> and<00:01:42.000> then<00:01:43.000> I'll<00:01:43.240> cut<00:01:43.509> it<00:01:43.660> in<00:01:43.840> half<00:01:44.110> so<00:01:44.590> I

00:01:45.089 --> 00:01:45.099 
snake and then I'll cut it in half so I

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:49.559 
snake and then I'll cut it in half so I
have<00:01:45.310> two<00:01:45.690> even<00:01:46.690> pieces<00:01:46.899> of<00:01:47.649> white<00:01:48.479> then<00:01:49.479> I

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:49.569

the<00:02:05.739> good<00:02:06.099> size<00:02:06.459> or<00:02:07.300> otherwise<00:02:08.050> you<00:02:08.380> dish<00:02:08.619> will

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
the good size or otherwise you dish will

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.490 
the good size or otherwise you dish will
be<00:02:08.920> too<00:02:09.160> thin<00:02:09.690> so<00:02:10.690> after<00:02:10.959> you've<00:02:11.110> got<00:02:11.140> all<00:02:11.290> your

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
be too thin so after you've got all your

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.080 
be too thin so after you've got all your
colors<00:02:11.890> there<00:02:12.130> and<00:02:12.489> you<00:02:12.610> can<00:02:12.819> roll<00:02:13.060> it

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
colors there and you can roll it

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.890 
colors there and you can roll it
together<00:02:13.720> and<00:02:15.090> after<00:02:16.090> you've<00:02:16.239> rolled<00:02:16.420> it<00:02:16.750> you

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
together and after you've rolled it you

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.390 
together and after you've rolled it you
just<00:02:17.080> want<00:02:17.349> to<00:02:17.440> twist<00:02:17.800> it<00:02:18.099> together<00:02:18.780> like<00:02:19.780> this

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
just want to twist it together like this

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.309 
just want to twist it together like this
all<00:02:21.400> the<00:02:21.610> way<00:02:21.640> down

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
all the way down

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.369 
all the way down
and<00:02:24.159> then<00:02:25.150> you<00:02:25.329> want<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:25.629> roll<00:02:25.840> it<00:02:25.870> out<00:02:26.140> again

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
and then you want to roll it out again

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.890 
and then you want to roll it out again
and<00:02:26.860> this<00:02:27.609> is<00:02:27.790> to<00:02:28.000> mix<00:02:28.209> all<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.569> colors

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
and this is to mix all the colors

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.530 
and this is to mix all the colors
together<00:02:29.079> and<00:02:29.790> then<00:02:30.790> you'll<00:02:30.939> fold<00:02:31.269> it<00:02:31.420> in<00:02:31.510> half

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
together and then you'll fold it in half

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.199 
together and then you'll fold it in half
and<00:02:32.140> again<00:02:32.469> twist<00:02:33.099> it<00:02:33.340> together<00:02:33.760> just<00:02:33.849> like

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
and again twist it together just like

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.000 
and again twist it together just like
you<00:02:34.329> did<00:02:34.629> before<00:02:36.629> and<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:38.650> want<00:02:38.799> to<00:02:38.859> keep

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
you did before and you want to keep

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.339 
you did before and you want to keep
doing<00:02:39.370> this<00:02:39.609> until<00:02:39.879> you<00:02:40.269> get<00:02:40.569> a<00:02:40.599> pattern<00:02:40.959> that

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
doing this until you get a pattern that

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.979 
doing this until you get a pattern that
you're<00:02:41.500> happy<00:02:41.769> with<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:42.489> then<00:02:43.450> after<00:02:43.840> you've

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
you're happy with and then after you've

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.460 
you're happy with and then after you've
done<00:02:44.140> that<00:02:44.200> you<00:02:44.620> can<00:02:44.829> roll<00:02:45.069> it<00:02:45.310> into<00:02:45.579> a<00:02:45.849> ball

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
done that you can roll it into a ball

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.479 
done that you can roll it into a ball
obviously<00:02:47.470> you<00:02:47.530> don't<00:02:47.650> want<00:02:47.799> to<00:02:47.980> do<00:02:48.099> it<00:02:48.220> too

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
obviously you don't want to do it too

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.869 
obviously you don't want to do it too
much<00:02:48.519> so<00:02:49.209> the<00:02:49.450> colors<00:02:49.840> don't<00:02:50.590> disappear<00:02:51.370> but

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:51.879 
much so the colors don't disappear but

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:53.520 
much so the colors don't disappear but
you<00:02:52.000> want<00:02:52.180> to<00:02:52.269> do<00:02:52.389> it<00:02:52.510> so<00:02:52.840> much<00:02:53.049> that<00:02:53.290> you<00:02:53.379> can

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
you want to do it so much that you can

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.500 
you want to do it so much that you can
still<00:02:53.739> see<00:02:53.769> all<00:02:54.069> the<00:02:54.430> colors<00:02:54.790> after<00:02:55.090> I<00:02:55.269> did

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
still see all the colors after I did

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.809 
still see all the colors after I did
that<00:02:55.540> I<00:02:55.720> decided<00:02:56.260> that<00:02:56.470> it<00:02:56.920> needed<00:02:56.950> something

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
that I decided that it needed something

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.879 
that I decided that it needed something
else<00:02:58.000> to<00:02:58.239> it<00:02:58.540> so<00:02:58.750> I<00:02:58.810> decided<00:02:59.230> to<00:02:59.439> add<00:02:59.620> a<00:02:59.650> little

00:02:59.879 --> 00:02:59.889 
else to it so I decided to add a little

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:02.099 
else to it so I decided to add a little
bit<00:03:00.250> of<00:03:00.280> black<00:03:00.730> and<00:03:01.000> a<00:03:01.120> little<00:03:01.450> bit<00:03:01.599> of<00:03:01.750> grey

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
bit of black and a little bit of grey

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:04.800 
bit of black and a little bit of grey
just<00:03:02.560> add<00:03:02.829> some<00:03:03.159> more<00:03:03.340> colors<00:03:03.760> and<00:03:04.060> a<00:03:04.629> little

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
just add some more colors and a little

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.830 
just add some more colors and a little
bit<00:03:04.959> more<00:03:05.109> pattern<00:03:05.500> to<00:03:05.739> it<00:03:06.000> so<00:03:07.000> I<00:03:07.030> did<00:03:07.329> that<00:03:07.540> and

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
bit more pattern to it so I did that and

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.720 
bit more pattern to it so I did that and
I<00:03:08.109> rolled<00:03:08.349> it<00:03:08.560> out<00:03:08.680> and<00:03:09.069> then<00:03:09.310> I<00:03:09.340> rolled<00:03:09.609> it

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
I rolled it out and then I rolled it

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.080 
I rolled it out and then I rolled it
into<00:03:10.000> a<00:03:10.030> ball<00:03:10.299> again<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:11.639> that's<00:03:12.639> the<00:03:12.849> type<00:03:13.060> of

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
into a ball again and that's the type of

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.539 
into a ball again and that's the type of
thing<00:03:13.419> I've<00:03:13.599> got<00:03:13.650> then<00:03:14.650> you<00:03:14.769> want<00:03:14.950> to<00:03:15.010> pick<00:03:15.280> the

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
thing I've got then you want to pick the

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.460 
thing I've got then you want to pick the
side<00:03:15.790> that<00:03:16.090> you<00:03:16.209> want<00:03:16.239> to<00:03:16.599> roll<00:03:16.840> out<00:03:16.870> which<00:03:17.290> you

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
side that you want to roll out which you

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.800 
side that you want to roll out which you
think<00:03:17.709> are<00:03:17.829> the<00:03:18.099> best<00:03:18.400> and<00:03:18.849> then<00:03:19.419> you<00:03:19.540> want<00:03:19.720> to

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
think are the best and then you want to

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.929 
think are the best and then you want to
roll<00:03:20.019> it<00:03:20.049> out<00:03:20.349> but<00:03:21.340> you<00:03:21.370> want<00:03:21.579> to<00:03:21.730> make<00:03:21.909> sure

00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:21.939 
roll it out but you want to make sure

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:25.349 
roll it out but you want to make sure
not<00:03:22.450> to<00:03:22.480> roll<00:03:22.840> out<00:03:23.169> your<00:03:23.590> dish<00:03:24.340> too<00:03:24.819> thin

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359 
not to roll out your dish too thin

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:27.930 
not to roll out your dish too thin
because<00:03:25.720> I<00:03:25.930> made<00:03:26.230> that<00:03:26.260> mistake<00:03:26.650> before<00:03:26.950> if

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
because I made that mistake before if

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.539 
because I made that mistake before if
it's<00:03:28.150> too<00:03:28.449> thin<00:03:28.780> it<00:03:29.470> will<00:03:29.650> end<00:03:29.799> up<00:03:29.949> being<00:03:30.099> quite

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
it's too thin it will end up being quite

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.780 
it's too thin it will end up being quite
bendy<00:03:31.269> like<00:03:31.510> this<00:03:31.810> one<00:03:32.139> and<00:03:32.530> no<00:03:33.310> matter<00:03:33.489> how

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
bendy like this one and no matter how

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.119 
bendy like this one and no matter how
long<00:03:34.000> you<00:03:34.180> put<00:03:34.389> it<00:03:34.479> in<00:03:34.720> for<00:03:35.049> it<00:03:35.260> will<00:03:35.470> still<00:03:35.799> be

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129 
long you put it in for it will still be

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:38.339 
long you put it in for it will still be
quite<00:03:36.370> bendy<00:03:36.879> like<00:03:37.060> this<00:03:37.329> and<00:03:37.569> it<00:03:37.659> is<00:03:37.780> set<00:03:38.139> it's

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
quite bendy like this and it is set it's

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:40.469 
quite bendy like this and it is set it's
just<00:03:38.620> that<00:03:38.799> it's<00:03:38.949> quite<00:03:39.250> thin<00:03:39.639> where<00:03:40.180> is<00:03:40.299> this

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:40.479 
just that it's quite thin where is this

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:42.780 
just that it's quite thin where is this
one<00:03:40.810> which<00:03:41.799> is<00:03:41.829> the<00:03:41.979> one<00:03:42.190> I<00:03:42.220> showed<00:03:42.489> you<00:03:42.639> in<00:03:42.699> the

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
one which is the one I showed you in the

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.569 
one which is the one I showed you in the
video<00:03:42.940> is<00:03:43.389> quite<00:03:43.629> thick<00:03:44.079> and<00:03:44.349> it<00:03:44.709> is<00:03:44.799> not<00:03:45.099> bendy

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
video is quite thick and it is not bendy

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:47.909 
video is quite thick and it is not bendy
this<00:03:46.180> is<00:03:46.389> quite<00:03:46.629> a<00:03:46.659> good<00:03:46.930> thickness<00:03:47.229> and<00:03:47.709> I

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:47.919 
this is quite a good thickness and I

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:50.490 
this is quite a good thickness and I
would<00:03:48.190> say<00:03:48.430> this<00:03:48.699> was<00:03:49.060> about<00:03:49.479> a<00:03:49.810> centimeter

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
would say this was about a centimeter

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.909 
would say this was about a centimeter
thick<00:03:51.299> so<00:03:52.299> aim<00:03:52.659> to<00:03:52.930> get<00:03:53.109> your<00:03:53.409> dishes<00:03:53.889> a

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:53.919 
thick so aim to get your dishes a

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:56.309 
thick so aim to get your dishes a
centimeter<00:03:54.699> thick<00:03:54.729> so<00:03:55.389> now<00:03:55.690> I'm<00:03:55.840> just<00:03:56.049> showing

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319

shape<00:05:37.530> of<00:05:37.770> your<00:05:38.039> dish<00:05:38.250> before<00:05:38.729> it's

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
shape of your dish before it's

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.460

completely cooled and completely

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.830 
completely cooled and completely
hardened<00:05:41.099> so<00:05:41.760> make<00:05:41.940> sure<00:05:41.970> you<00:05:42.240> do<00:05:42.389> that<00:05:42.570> first

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
hardened so make sure you do that first

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.339 
hardened so make sure you do that first
