I<00:00:04.020> started<00:00:05.020> longboarding<00:00:05.530> and<00:00:05.770> you<00:00:06.520> always

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:06.730 
I started longboarding and you always

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.190 
I started longboarding and you always
have<00:00:06.880> to<00:00:06.970> go<00:00:07.090> and<00:00:07.270> find<00:00:07.450> a<00:00:07.600> good<00:00:07.750> Hill<00:00:07.960> you<00:00:08.109> know

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:08.200 
have to go and find a good Hill you know

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.930 
have to go and find a good Hill you know
you're<00:00:08.380> with<00:00:08.500> her<00:00:08.650> friends<00:00:09.130> and<00:00:09.340> you<00:00:09.790> throw

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:09.940 
you're with her friends and you throw

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.370 
you're with her friends and you throw
your<00:00:10.090> boards<00:00:10.390> in<00:00:10.570> the<00:00:10.630> back<00:00:10.840> and<00:00:11.050> they<00:00:11.140> get<00:00:11.230> all

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:11.380 
your boards in the back and they get all

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.020 
your boards in the back and they get all
tangled<00:00:11.740> up<00:00:11.890> together<00:00:12.070> start<00:00:12.760> scratching

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.030 
tangled up together start scratching

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.030 
tangled up together start scratching
your<00:00:13.360> interior<00:00:13.690> it<00:00:14.110> scratches<00:00:14.410> up<00:00:14.710> something

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.040 
your interior it scratches up something

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.130 
your interior it scratches up something
else<00:00:15.190> in<00:00:15.370> your<00:00:15.460> car<00:00:15.700> and<00:00:16.029> I<00:00:16.360> figured<00:00:16.660> there's<00:00:17.050> a

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.140 
else in your car and I figured there's a

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.840 
else in your car and I figured there's a
rack<00:00:17.530> for<00:00:17.800> every<00:00:18.070> other<00:00:18.190> kind<00:00:18.430> of<00:00:18.550> boards

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:18.850 
rack for every other kind of boards

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.000 
rack for every other kind of boards
snowboards<00:00:19.390> wake<00:00:19.570> boards<00:00:19.990> surfboards<00:00:20.800> you

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.010 
snowboards wake boards surfboards you

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.830 
snowboards wake boards surfboards you
know<00:00:21.100> so<00:00:21.369> there's<00:00:21.640> got<00:00:21.789> to<00:00:21.910> be<00:00:21.940> one<00:00:22.119> for<00:00:22.510> a

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840 
know so there's got to be one for a

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:23.910 
know so there's got to be one for a
longboard

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:23.920 
longboard

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.099 
longboard
but<00:00:24.279> as<00:00:24.760> I<00:00:24.820> looked<00:00:25.150> online<00:00:25.330> there<00:00:25.750> wasn't

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:26.109 
but as I looked online there wasn't

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.019 
but as I looked online there wasn't
anything<00:00:26.320> for<00:00:26.770> it<00:00:26.800> and<00:00:27.070> so<00:00:27.340> saw<00:00:27.970> the

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
anything for it and so saw the

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.000 
anything for it and so saw the
opportunity<00:00:28.750> and<00:00:28.930> I<00:00:29.020> figured<00:00:29.350> I<00:00:29.500> should<00:00:29.529> I

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.010 
opportunity and I figured I should I

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:37.319 
opportunity and I figured I should I
should<00:00:30.310> come<00:00:30.460> up<00:00:30.490> with<00:00:30.640> the<00:00:30.910> product

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.170 

so<00:00:38.170> the<00:00:38.469> longboard<00:00:38.890> wreck<00:00:39.100> that<00:00:39.430> I<00:00:39.460> invented

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
so the longboard wreck that I invented

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.660 
so the longboard wreck that I invented
what<00:00:40.719> it<00:00:40.840> does<00:00:41.020> it<00:00:41.260> creates<00:00:41.470> more<00:00:41.829> space<00:00:42.160> it

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
what it does it creates more space it

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.670 
what it does it creates more space it
protects<00:00:43.210> your<00:00:43.360> board<00:00:43.629> and<00:00:43.899> your<00:00:44.110> car<00:00:44.320> from

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
protects your board and your car from

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.500 
protects your board and your car from
your<00:00:44.829> board<00:00:45.070> and<00:00:45.280> it's<00:00:45.460> super<00:00:45.850> simple<00:00:46.059> to<00:00:46.239> you

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
your board and it's super simple to you

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.780 
your board and it's super simple to you
so<00:00:46.750> it<00:00:46.870> doesn't<00:00:46.899> detract<00:00:47.500> or<00:00:47.860> take<00:00:48.280> away<00:00:48.460> from

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
so it doesn't detract or take away from

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.400 
so it doesn't detract or take away from
the<00:00:49.120> time<00:00:49.329> that<00:00:49.390> you<00:00:49.690> spend<00:00:50.050> actually

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
the time that you spend actually

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.069 
the time that you spend actually
boarding<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:52.149> it's<00:00:52.360> made<00:00:52.510> out<00:00:52.629> of<00:00:52.690> Baltic

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
boarding so it's made out of Baltic

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.710 
boarding so it's made out of Baltic
birch<00:00:53.260> and<00:00:53.650> aluminum<00:00:54.460> and<00:00:54.670> if<00:00:55.180> you<00:00:55.390> don't<00:00:55.600> know

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
birch and aluminum and if you don't know

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.210 
birch and aluminum and if you don't know
already<00:00:56.050> the<00:00:56.230> Baltic<00:00:56.559> birch<00:00:56.710> is<00:00:56.920> what<00:00:57.070> most

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
already the Baltic birch is what most

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.770 
already the Baltic birch is what most
long<00:00:57.460> boards<00:00:57.730> are<00:00:57.850> made<00:00:57.970> out<00:00:58.120> of<00:00:58.210> the<00:00:58.360> back<00:00:58.540> of

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
long boards are made out of the back of

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.569 
long boards are made out of the back of
it<00:00:58.870> has<00:00:59.199> these<00:00:59.409> little<00:00:59.470> notches<00:00:59.860> on<00:01:00.250> it<00:01:00.370> so

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
it has these little notches on it so

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:02.670 
it has these little notches on it so
that<00:01:00.760> it<00:01:00.850> hooks<00:01:00.970> right<00:01:01.390> into<00:01:01.989> your<00:01:02.320> headrest

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
that it hooks right into your headrest

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.259 
that it hooks right into your headrest
track<00:01:02.980> that<00:01:03.220> goes<00:01:03.370> in<00:01:03.550> the<00:01:03.640> back<00:01:03.790> of<00:01:03.940> your<00:01:04.030> car

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
track that goes in the back of your car

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:05.969 
track that goes in the back of your car
but<00:01:04.720> the<00:01:04.809> cool<00:01:04.989> thing<00:01:05.019> is<00:01:05.350> you<00:01:05.379> can<00:01:05.710> take<00:01:05.830> it

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
but the cool thing is you can take it

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:07.859 
but the cool thing is you can take it
off<00:01:06.130> the<00:01:06.159> rack<00:01:06.490> and<00:01:06.729> put<00:01:07.060> it<00:01:07.180> right<00:01:07.240> onto<00:01:07.600> your

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
off the rack and put it right onto your

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:10.020 
off the rack and put it right onto your
wall<00:01:07.990> when<00:01:08.380> I<00:01:08.409> finished<00:01:08.770> the<00:01:08.860> prototype<00:01:09.340> I<00:01:09.580> put

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
wall when I finished the prototype I put

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.310 
wall when I finished the prototype I put
it<00:01:10.119> right<00:01:10.270> in<00:01:10.390> my<00:01:10.420> car<00:01:10.750> because<00:01:10.840> I<00:01:11.050> wanted<00:01:11.259> to

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
it right in my car because I wanted to

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.080 
it right in my car because I wanted to
test<00:01:11.619> it<00:01:11.800> out<00:01:11.890> I<00:01:11.950> thought<00:01:12.250> of<00:01:12.399> something<00:01:12.820> that

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
test it out I thought of something that

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.969 
test it out I thought of something that
I<00:01:13.149> could<00:01:13.390> do<00:01:13.509> to<00:01:13.630> make<00:01:13.660> it<00:01:13.780> better<00:01:13.930> and<00:01:14.289> I<00:01:14.920> took

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
I could do to make it better and I took

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.100 
I could do to make it better and I took
it<00:01:15.250> off<00:01:15.369> just<00:01:15.729> in<00:01:15.970> that<00:01:16.119> like<00:01:16.420> time<00:01:16.630> when<00:01:16.869> I<00:01:16.899> had

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
it off just in that like time when I had

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.260 
it off just in that like time when I had
my<00:01:17.259> board<00:01:17.530> sitting<00:01:17.950> there<00:01:18.130> on<00:01:18.369> my<00:01:18.399> seat<00:01:18.910> or<00:01:19.119> on

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
my board sitting there on my seat or on

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.990 
my board sitting there on my seat or on
the<00:01:19.420> ground<00:01:19.630> in<00:01:19.840> the<00:01:19.960> trunk<00:01:20.229> like<00:01:20.560> it<00:01:21.520> just<00:01:21.789> was

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
the ground in the trunk like it just was

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.719 
the ground in the trunk like it just was
so<00:01:22.270> bothersome<00:01:23.050> it<00:01:23.289> kept<00:01:23.530> rolling<00:01:23.800> around<00:01:24.160> and

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729
