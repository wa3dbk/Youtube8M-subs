00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:08.740
 all of us want to keep our 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:11.380
 vitality our youth look good 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.360
 and healthy and today I'm going to share the 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.190
 traditional recipe for green juices that 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.349
 can get in which one would play but 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.570
 still this is much better because it is a 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:22.239
 green juice with super food this is very 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.579
 easy they have a good blender that's 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:27.820
 super important to have a blender with 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:31.960
 strong power and we are going to put here a 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:34.420
 little pineapple that the pineapple besides 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.640
 that gives us vitamin c has high 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.230
 celery water content than celery 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.839
 we are also high in water 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.120
 to hydrate us and nopal that is going to 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:45.250
 help digestion to fiber and 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.230
 also to remove hunger for all 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.390
 you who are on a diet we are going to put 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.820
 a little parsley that the parsley 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.890
 it's antibacterial and antiviral then it goes 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.129
 to prevent many diseases and 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.820
 colds and other we can use water 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.079
 natural 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:04.150
 you can use grapefruit juice base or 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.130
 you can also use orange juice 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.630
 and now if the magic starts because 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.030
 we are going to incorporate the 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.539
 refute this time you can play 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.090
 with burley with widgets with chlorella yo 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:18.280
 in this specific case I opted for 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.979
 use moringa that bounced a 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.509
 teaspoon that we already know that the 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.110
 moringa helps us maintain the pressure 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:27.009
 low takes away our hunger too 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.479
 spirulina of course because 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:32.170
 we need protein here I'm going to throw 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.939
 two a little chia not especially for 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.310
 those of us who are on a diet or want us 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.780
 take care a little bit more this is super 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.349
 important and will also give us the 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.209
 omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids and nothing 

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:45.099
 more to give him a little bit of ponzi 

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:48.549
 taste a bit of salt can be 

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:50.439
 himalayas or sea and a little pepper 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.569
 cayena that also helps us eliminate 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.939
 all the mucus and eliminate the claw waits 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:57.880
 sinusitis and also it's going to 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.679
 give a touch of spice that then 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.979
 we are mexican and we love the spicy 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:01.979
 true 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.830
 Y 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.530
 because it's a green juice if it's not in 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.870
 extractors is another question to me 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.120
 like it because it's going to keep it all intact 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.430
 the food and not many of us 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.030
 we have the ability to drink juices all 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.709
 the day and this is much easier 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.330
 and you can put a parsley leaf 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.140
 so that your juice looks coquettish 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.140
 my health
