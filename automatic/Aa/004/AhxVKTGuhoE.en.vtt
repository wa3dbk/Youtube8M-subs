the<00:01:58.330> bottom<00:01:58.689> person<00:01:58.990> I<00:01:59.049> think<00:01:59.229> it<00:01:59.319> looks

00:01:59.339 --> 00:01:59.349 
the bottom person I think it looks

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:00.960 
the bottom person I think it looks
better<00:01:59.560> at<00:01:59.920> the<00:01:59.979> top<00:02:00.159> of<00:02:00.189> the<00:02:00.340> door<00:02:00.490> but<00:02:00.729> I

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
right away you just type m /

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.059 
right away you just type m /
and<00:03:45.500> then<00:03:45.650> tap<00:03:46.040> out<00:03:46.219> go<00:03:46.370> ahead<00:03:46.430> and<00:03:46.730> add<00:03:46.790> them
