confess I've been doing it quite a few
different<00:03:45.730> ways<00:03:45.819> when<00:03:46.120> I<00:03:46.150> was<00:03:46.329> just<00:03:46.510> watching

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
different ways when I was just watching

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.960 
different ways when I was just watching
myself<00:03:47.200> play<00:03:47.410> it<00:03:47.470> then<00:03:47.709> one<00:03:48.400> of<00:03:48.519> the<00:03:48.579> things<00:03:48.790> I

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
myself play it then one of the things I

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.550 
myself play it then one of the things I
really<00:03:49.269> loved<00:03:49.420> about<00:03:49.450> Freddie<00:03:49.959> kings<00:03:50.230> playing

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
really loved about Freddie kings playing

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.930 
really loved about Freddie kings playing
is<00:03:50.799> the<00:03:50.950> way<00:03:51.040> that<00:03:51.220> he<00:03:51.280> can<00:03:51.430> put<00:03:51.639> just<00:03:51.819> a<00:03:51.910> little

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
is the way that he can put just a little

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.270 
is the way that he can put just a little
bit<00:03:52.269> of<00:03:52.359> a<00:03:52.450> rhythmic<00:03:52.690> twist<00:03:53.260> on<00:03:53.470> a<00:03:53.530> kind<00:03:54.130> of

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
bit of a rhythmic twist on a kind of

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.069 
bit of a rhythmic twist on a kind of
tired<00:03:54.579> old<00:03:54.849> blues<00:03:55.209> lick<00:03:55.450> and<00:03:55.630> bring<00:03:55.900> it<00:03:55.989> a

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
tired old blues lick and bring it a

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:57.780 
tired old blues lick and bring it a
whole<00:03:56.290> new<00:03:56.530> lease<00:03:56.889> of<00:03:56.920> life<00:03:57.130> you<00:03:57.489> know<00:03:57.609> with

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
whole new lease of life you know with

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.849 
whole new lease of life you know with
this<00:03:57.910> lick<00:03:58.150> the<00:03:58.569> first<00:03:58.810> part<00:03:59.109> it's<00:03:59.680> pretty

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859 
this lick the first part it's pretty

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:03.259 
this lick the first part it's pretty
kind<00:04:00.130> of<00:04:00.220> a<00:04:00.310> standard<00:04:00.760> blues<00:04:00.970> thing<00:04:01.209> I<00:04:01.239> guess

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
kind of a standard blues thing I guess

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.319 
kind of a standard blues thing I guess
but<00:04:04.269> adding<00:04:04.599> that<00:04:05.910> suddenly<00:04:06.910> gives<00:04:07.120> it<00:04:07.269> a

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
but adding that suddenly gives it a

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:09.360 
but adding that suddenly gives it a
whole<00:04:07.450> lot<00:04:07.510> more<00:04:07.690> funk<00:04:08.200> in<00:04:08.380> it<00:04:08.500> just<00:04:08.739> grooves

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
whole lot more funk in it just grooves

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.339 
whole lot more funk in it just grooves
it<00:04:09.579> in<00:04:09.700> a<00:04:09.819> whole<00:04:10.000> different<00:04:10.180> way<00:04:10.510> so<00:04:10.569> that's

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349 
it in a whole different way so that's

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:12.449 
it in a whole different way so that's
the<00:04:11.560> kind<00:04:11.769> of<00:04:11.860> thing<00:04:12.010> you<00:04:12.129> want<00:04:12.250> to<00:04:12.370> be

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
as I've said a number of times it's

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:16.440
