and it was at the time state-of-the-art

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.780 
and it was at the time state-of-the-art
but<00:03:26.070> as<00:03:26.850> with<00:03:27.300> all<00:03:27.420> things<00:03:27.920> time<00:03:28.920> does<00:03:29.190> a<00:03:29.430> lot

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
but as with all things time does a lot

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:37.820 
but as with all things time does a lot
of<00:03:30.090> stuff<00:03:30.540> to<00:03:32.660> a<00:03:33.660> building<00:03:34.140> and<00:03:36.260> today<00:03:37.260> will<00:03:37.710> be

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
of stuff to a building and today will be

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:47.150 
of stuff to a building and today will be
the<00:03:37.860> end<00:03:38.100> of<00:03:38.250> this<00:03:38.310> building<00:03:44.810> so<00:03:45.810> yes<00:03:46.380> as<00:03:46.830> I

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
the end of this building so yes as I

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:56.480 
the end of this building so yes as I
stated<00:03:47.430> before<00:03:48.500> the<00:03:49.500> theater<00:03:54.770> was<00:03:55.770> closed<00:03:56.190> in

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.490

remember what movie it was but i do
remember<00:04:08.580> what<00:04:09.060> it<00:04:09.150> was<00:04:09.270> like<00:04:09.300> inside<00:04:09.870> and<00:04:10.320> i

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
remember what it was like inside and i

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.040 
remember what it was like inside and i
can<00:04:10.770> tell<00:04:10.950> you<00:04:10.980> right<00:04:11.370> here<00:04:12.000> right<00:04:12.060> now<00:04:12.300> it<00:04:12.810> was

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
can tell you right here right now it was

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.530 
can tell you right here right now it was
beautiful<00:04:13.680> inside<00:04:14.120> there<00:04:15.120> was<00:04:15.240> a<00:04:15.270> hidden

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
beautiful inside there was a hidden

beautiful inside there was a hidden
balcony<00:04:16.310> the<00:04:17.310> seating<00:04:18.090> was<00:04:18.920> magnificent<00:04:19.920> i

wish<00:04:21.870> i<00:04:21.989> could<00:04:22.140> go<00:04:22.260> into<00:04:22.470> more<00:04:22.800> details<00:04:23.310> about

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
wish i could go into more details about

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.670 
wish i could go into more details about
it<00:04:23.850> but<00:04:24.060> this<00:04:24.780> was<00:04:25.110> 20<00:04:26.100> or<00:04:26.190> so<00:04:26.400> years<00:04:26.430> ago<00:04:27.680> well

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
it but this was 20 or so years ago well

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.230 
it but this was 20 or so years ago well
actually<00:04:28.950> more<00:04:29.340> like<00:04:29.520> 25<00:04:30.140> but<00:04:31.790> well<00:04:32.790> you<00:04:33.060> get

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
actually more like 25 but well you get

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.000 
actually more like 25 but well you get
the<00:04:33.270> point<00:04:34.070> anyway<00:04:35.540> it's<00:04:36.540> rather<00:04:37.230> sad<00:04:37.590> to<00:04:37.830> see

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
the point anyway it's rather sad to see

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:43.220 
the point anyway it's rather sad to see
a<00:04:38.310> bit<00:04:39.240> of<00:04:39.270> Hamiltonian<00:04:39.810> history<00:04:40.440> go<00:04:41.870> like<00:04:42.870> so

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
a bit of Hamiltonian history go like so

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.350 
a bit of Hamiltonian history go like so
many<00:04:43.380> other<00:04:43.680> pieces<00:04:43.980> of<00:04:44.160> Hamiltonian<00:04:44.700> history

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
many other pieces of Hamiltonian history

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.340 
many other pieces of Hamiltonian history
that<00:04:46.050> have<00:04:46.170> been<00:04:46.320> destroyed<00:04:46.740> due<00:04:47.400> to<00:04:47.820> neglect

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
that have been destroyed due to neglect

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.830 
that have been destroyed due to neglect
this<00:04:49.350> is<00:04:49.500> exactly<00:04:49.920> what<00:04:50.310> it<00:04:50.400> is<00:04:50.580> neglect

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
this is exactly what it is neglect

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.490 
this is exactly what it is neglect
they<00:04:53.440> could<00:04:53.650> have<00:04:53.680> saved<00:04:53.949> it<00:04:54.220> but<00:04:54.970> they<00:04:55.150> didn't

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
they could have saved it but they didn't

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.260 
they could have saved it but they didn't
all<00:04:56.500> they<00:04:56.770> did<00:04:56.830> was<00:04:57.040> say<00:04:57.550> oh<00:04:57.790> our<00:04:58.630> facade<00:04:59.410> is

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
all they did was say oh our facade is

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.790 
all they did was say oh our facade is
heritage<00:05:01.270> but<00:05:01.570> the<00:05:01.840> inside<00:05:02.199> we'll<00:05:02.560> just

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
heritage but the inside we'll just

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.550 
heritage but the inside we'll just
forget<00:05:02.919> about<00:05:03.070> that<00:05:03.460> and<00:05:04.020> they<00:05:05.020> forgot<00:05:05.350> about

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
forget about that and they forgot about

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:13.860 
forget about that and they forgot about
it<00:05:05.620> and<00:05:06.960> unfortunately<00:05:12.000> it<00:05:13.000> came<00:05:13.419> to<00:05:13.660> be<00:05:13.840> that

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
it and unfortunately it came to be that

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:23.340 
it and unfortunately it came to be that
this<00:05:14.680> building<00:05:15.070> will<00:05:15.550> be<00:05:15.580> no<00:05:15.850> more<00:05:21.990> as<00:05:22.990> you<00:05:23.260> can

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
this building will be no more as you can

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:28.129 
this building will be no more as you can
see<00:05:23.680> the<00:05:24.669> facade<00:05:25.060> has<00:05:25.360> seen<00:05:25.660> better<00:05:25.870> days

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:30.600 

start<00:05:29.139> really<00:05:29.350> starting<00:05:29.800> to<00:05:29.889> show<00:05:30.100> its<00:05:30.130> almost

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
start really starting to show its almost

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:38.810 
start really starting to show its almost
100<00:05:31.030> year<00:05:31.240> age

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.470 

but<00:05:40.470> it's<00:05:41.470> still<00:05:41.860> an<00:05:42.160> immaculate<00:05:43.120> looking

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:43.480 
but it's still an immaculate looking

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:53.159 
but it's still an immaculate looking
building<00:05:43.900> and<00:05:44.880> it<00:05:45.880> will<00:05:46.030> be<00:05:46.120> sad<00:05:46.390> to<00:05:46.570> see<00:05:46.750> it<00:05:46.780> go

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:53.169 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:56.010 

hopefully<00:05:54.099> this<00:05:55.090> will<00:05:55.240> be<00:05:55.300> the<00:05:55.389> last<00:05:55.629> building

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
hopefully this will be the last building

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.920 
hopefully this will be the last building
we<00:05:56.319> see<00:05:56.529> go<00:05:56.710> that<00:05:56.949> has<00:05:57.219> heritage<00:05:57.879> written<00:05:58.779> all

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
we see go that has heritage written all

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.010 
we see go that has heritage written all
over<00:05:58.960> it<00:05:59.580> because<00:06:00.580> I'm<00:06:00.759> fortunately<00:06:01.689> like<00:06:01.870> the

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
over it because I'm fortunately like the

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:07.700 
over it because I'm fortunately like the
Tivoli<00:06:03.060> this<00:06:04.060> one<00:06:04.300> just<00:06:04.539> couldn't<00:06:04.870> be<00:06:04.960> saved

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:15.480 

so<00:06:09.449> this<00:06:10.449> is<00:06:11.020> a<00:06:11.759> fond<00:06:12.759> farewell<00:06:13.300> to<00:06:14.279> the<00:06:15.279> old

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
so this is a fond farewell to the old

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:20.040 
so this is a fond farewell to the old
century<00:06:16.029> theater

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.790 

and<00:06:20.500> I<00:06:21.159> will<00:06:21.340> report<00:06:21.819> again<00:06:22.090> in<00:06:23.080> just<00:06:23.470> a<00:06:23.650> few

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
and I will report again in just a few

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.800 
and I will report again in just a few
hours<00:06:24.810> when<00:06:25.810> it<00:06:26.229> comes<00:06:26.500> down
