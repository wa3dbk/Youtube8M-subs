00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.040
 greetings to all in this opportunity 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.260
 must show a review of the first 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.950
 meeting li pop that exists for the galaxy 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.440
 s 4 in this case the gti 9.500 version 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.970
 although there is also a version for 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:55.990
 the galaxy s 4g lte 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:58.180
 well I'm here based on the same 12 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:01.090
 thanks to the team here we have 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:04.000
 already a rom for the galaxy s 4 though 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.850
 it is noteworthy that is still in 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.160
 in a beta version currently going by 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.770
 the fifth but still has some 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:15.220
 important mistakes especially in this 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.200
 model for the 9505 I understand that 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.810
 there are fewer errors and the rom 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.760
 it's more stable but in this case good 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.550
 we have some concrete errors that 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:28.390
 they are quite important and they make the 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:31.119
 student is completely recommendable 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.240
 for daily use not good for 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.520
 start the mistakes we have an error 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.140
 with the camera we can not take pictures of 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.570
 moment each time we select the 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:46.550
 camera will force us to close 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.550
 and it will not allow us to capture anything 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.690
 and it will give us 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.300
 strive 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.340
 and this from here with any application 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.350
 of camera that we use the result goes 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.120
 to be the same we will not be able to take 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.910
 Photographs 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:07.960
 another one of the errors that this rom has 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:10.390
 is that the nfc does not work either 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.200
 of the nfc as we can appreciate here is 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.180
 disabled 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.750
 it does not allow us to activate on the pc 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.810
 we have 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:22.140
 how to use nfc then so 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.290
 if you are using the nfc it is not 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.140
 advisable to use this rom 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.530
 for the moment as I mentioned it goes by the 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:34.930
 phase 5 is for the gt version and 9,500 the 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:38.040
 that I have tried on android 5.01 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.040
 we even have 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.950
 of lollipop 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.989
 the palette 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.540
 let's change colors we already have 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.080
 pressed then we get a game type 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:56.060
 rap and bits 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.440
 very popular good some time ago 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.860
 and 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.690
 another one of the mistakes that I have found 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.220
 to be testing today is that 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.610
 sometimes when I received some 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.610
 call 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.680
 the headset volume was lowered 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.690
 completely and I could not hear what 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.690
 the other person was telling me then 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.400
 it's a pretty important mistake and another 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.610
 error has to do with the connection 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.800
 wi-fi this wifi error even comes 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.910
 already present in version 11 of the ROM 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.710
 based on kitkat 4.4 point 4 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.560
 that I'm fine that error with the 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.150
 Wi-Fi connections we can hook 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.120
 a hollow network there but the problem is 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:41.780
 when we turn off the adapter or in this 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:44.060
 case when we reboot the device 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.670
 since automatically wi-fi networks 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.920
 they are deleted from the terminal and if we want 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.780
 connect us we have to put back 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.790
 the contraction something that really is 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.170
 quite annoying is every time 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.760
 we turn off the phone every time 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:00.230
 We put the wifi because it is having the 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.879
 password to be able to navigate 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.380
 these are the most important mistakes 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:09.170
 that found in rice 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:11.750
 if it's quite stable, it's not bad 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.870
 it's pretty nice to design a 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.570
 materialist and the elements of android 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.910
 lollipop but good these errors yes what 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.980
 make 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.480
 One option 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.300
 and it does not make it a good choice 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:28.360
 for daily use then good is 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.950
 advisable to wait until they continue 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.590
 working on a rom and we hope that from 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.500
 to little take out a one a little version 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.500
 more stable than this one can use it 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.650
 fixed in the brain in addition also 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:44.080
 mention that samsung seems to have 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.450
 put the batteries and they are working and in 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.910
 the android stock update 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.710
 lollipop for the galaxy s 4 at the moment and 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.840
 until the distribution for 5 s 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.120
 we hope that it will come out very soon 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.580
 it seems to end from here good then 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.350
 As you can see, I no longer have a connection 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:03.310
 Wifi 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.990
 I feel the settings and the wifi because the 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.680
 position table admiration means 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:12.180
 that is not connected 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:17.509
 if you good wi-fi networks available 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.509
 let's see what my wi-fi connection 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.320
 will appear but if I want to connect 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:27.710
 I could have to put the 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.490
 password 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:34.169
 is the problem with the rom 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.689
 Regarding passwords 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:38.680
 good in terms of elements 

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:41.910
 Now already it installed it 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:44.910
 the google does not stop the lollipop 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.910
 same 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:51.300
 all the elements of the cards 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:55.969
 good typical white screen 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:58.809
 of android lollipop settings 

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:58.809
 all settings 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:07.540
 on that white background they have that animation 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.260
 and we come to the end 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.260
 as we can see 

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:18.510
 when we select them then 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:21.830
 has all the lollipop animations 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.830
 and material design 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.680
 same 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.380
 the die the hero 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:34.370
 the keyboard to dial phones too 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:36.590
 It has been redesigned 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:39.410
 as we can see also in the wall of 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:41.660
 above we have already been colored according to 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:44.689
 the application that we are using 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:48.050
 in true we are 

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:49.940
 well then although there are some 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.879
 applications that are already of the system already 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:56.770
 it is painted but in some it is not yet 

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:56.770
 still like missing that option 

00:06:57.319 --> 00:07:04.569
 and we also can see when you des 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:09.369
 account of some that are adapting 

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:13.260
 we have the administrator to change 

00:07:09.369 --> 00:07:16.460
 apps lollipop android 

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.460
 type of cards 

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:28.000
 it is quite the rom, yes yes and it is 

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:30.070
 Pretty fluid is not bad at all 

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.389
 problem are those mistakes that you have to 

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:33.169
 we hope that he will soon leave 

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:35.539
 solving 

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:39.110
 good when you just have something new 

00:07:35.539 --> 00:07:42.139
 additional would be here commenting on that 

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:44.229
 it's all for the moment until the next 

00:07:42.139 --> 00:07:44.229
 chance
