00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
and let me know because I rarely see

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.630 
and let me know because I rarely see
this<00:00:58.289> simple<00:00:58.530> fact<00:00:58.800> mentioned<00:00:59.309> anywhere

this simple fact mentioned anywhere
which<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.239> why<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.539> also<00:01:00.750> made<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.109> video<00:01:01.289> about

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
which is why I also made a video about

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.950 
which is why I also made a video about
it<00:01:01.680> called<00:01:02.039> inflamed<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.579> scam<00:01:02.940> exposed<00:01:03.239> I

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
it called inflamed a scam exposed I

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.810 
it called inflamed a scam exposed I
think<00:01:04.739> it's<00:01:04.860> still<00:01:05.010> one<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.280> those<00:01:05.339> insider

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
think it's still one of those insider

think it's still one of those insider
secrets<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.510> medical<00:01:06.869> pharmaceutical

also<00:01:12.240> think<00:01:12.630> learning<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:13.260> simple<00:01:13.619> fact<00:01:13.830> is

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
also think learning this simple fact is

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.490 
also think learning this simple fact is
a<00:01:14.100> big<00:01:14.549> step<00:01:14.880> toward<00:01:15.450> understanding<00:01:15.540> how<00:01:16.439> to

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
a big step toward understanding how to

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.590 
a big step toward understanding how to
help<00:01:16.740> tennis<00:01:17.100> elbow<00:01:17.250> heal<00:01:17.759> rather<00:01:18.299> than

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
help tennis elbow heal rather than

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.499 
help tennis elbow heal rather than
fighting<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.950> what<00:01:20.100> happens<00:01:20.520> anytime<00:01:21.390> you

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
fighting it so what happens anytime you

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.300 
fighting it so what happens anytime you
injure<00:01:21.810> something<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.100> healing

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
injure something is that the healing

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.940 
injure something is that the healing
process<00:01:23.850> kicks<00:01:24.150> in<00:01:24.390> an<00:01:24.810> inflammation<00:01:25.500> that's

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
process kicks in an inflammation that's

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.149 
process kicks in an inflammation that's
the<00:01:26.250> first<00:01:26.460> step<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.030> process<00:01:28.159> now

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
the first step in that process now

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.950 
the first step in that process now
sometimes<00:01:29.820> when<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.150> have<00:01:30.299> what<00:01:30.600> they<00:01:30.720> call

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
sometimes when you have what they call

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.469 
sometimes when you have what they call
an<00:01:31.259> acute<00:01:31.710> injury<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.729> do<00:01:32.939> get<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.119> lot<00:01:33.329> of

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
an acute injury you do get a lot of

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.660 
an acute injury you do get a lot of
swelling<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.020> in<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.829> case<00:01:35.100> there<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.490> some

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
swelling and in that case there is some

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.700 
swelling and in that case there is some
benefit<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.060> using<00:01:36.299> ice<00:01:36.570> right<00:01:37.290> after<00:01:37.590> the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
benefit to using ice right after the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.370 
benefit to using ice right after the
injury<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.640> reduce<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.119> swelling<00:01:39.329> now<00:01:40.200> let's

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
injury to reduce the swelling now let's

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.620 
injury to reduce the swelling now let's
break<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.710> down<00:01:40.770> an<00:01:41.250> acute<00:01:41.970> injury<00:01:42.180> is

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
break that down an acute injury is

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.600 
break that down an acute injury is
usually<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> more<00:01:43.409> sudden<00:01:43.799> dramatic<00:01:44.310> kind<00:01:44.460> of

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
usually a more sudden dramatic kind of

while of course that's better than

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.970 
while of course that's better than

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
remember ever seeing one person who had

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.500 
remember ever seeing one person who had
any<00:03:29.130> significant<00:03:29.790> swelling<00:03:30.150> around<00:03:30.269> their

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
any significant swelling around their

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.180 
any significant swelling around their
elbow<00:03:30.920> okay<00:03:31.950> let's<00:03:32.819> quickly<00:03:33.120> sum<00:03:33.450> it<00:03:33.569> up<00:03:33.630> now

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
elbow okay let's quickly sum it up now

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.259 
elbow okay let's quickly sum it up now
inflammation<00:03:35.190> is<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.400> first<00:03:35.700> step<00:03:35.910> in<00:03:36.120> your

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
inflammation is the first step in your

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.910 
inflammation is the first step in your
healing<00:03:36.569> process<00:03:36.690> and<00:03:37.260> you<00:03:37.470> can't<00:03:37.709> have<00:03:37.889> any

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
healing process and you can't have any

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.979 
healing process and you can't have any
healing<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:38.609> repair<00:03:39.000> if<00:03:39.209> it<00:03:39.510> doesn't<00:03:39.840> happen

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
healing and repair if it doesn't happen

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.409 
healing and repair if it doesn't happen
if<00:03:40.290> there's<00:03:41.160> raging<00:03:41.669> inflammation<00:03:42.239> that's

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:42.419 
if there's raging inflammation that's

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:44.690 
if there's raging inflammation that's
causing<00:03:42.690> a<00:03:42.930> lot<00:03:42.959> of<00:03:43.169> actual<00:03:43.680> visible<00:03:44.160> swelling

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
causing a lot of actual visible swelling

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.659 
causing a lot of actual visible swelling
then<00:03:45.389> icing<00:03:45.870> it<00:03:45.989> down<00:03:46.410> a<00:03:46.440> bit<00:03:46.739> to<00:03:47.190> reduce<00:03:47.310> the

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
then icing it down a bit to reduce the

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.789 
then icing it down a bit to reduce the
swelling<00:03:47.910> is<00:03:48.120> helpful<00:03:48.510> but<00:03:49.079> this<00:03:49.290> is<00:03:49.470> usually

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
swelling is helpful but this is usually

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.589 
swelling is helpful but this is usually
only<00:03:50.220> right<00:03:50.519> after<00:03:50.790> an<00:03:50.880> acute<00:03:51.150> traumatic

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
only right after an acute traumatic

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.530 
only right after an acute traumatic
injury<00:03:52.230> and<00:03:52.440> typically<00:03:53.160> not<00:03:53.489> in<00:03:53.790> most<00:03:54.269> cases

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
injury and typically not in most cases

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.319 
injury and typically not in most cases
of<00:03:54.810> tennis<00:03:55.079> elbow<00:03:55.200> if<00:03:55.849> there's<00:03:56.849> no<00:03:57.000> swelling

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
of tennis elbow if there's no swelling

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.319 
of tennis elbow if there's no swelling
only<00:03:57.900> redness<00:03:58.380> pain<00:03:58.829> tenderness<00:03:59.280> and<00:03:59.669> similar

only redness pain tenderness and similar

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.569 
only redness pain tenderness and similar
symptoms<00:04:00.750> then<00:04:01.530> you<00:04:01.650> could<00:04:01.889> use<00:04:02.069> ice<00:04:02.250> to<00:04:02.459> make

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
symptoms then you could use ice to make

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:03.259 
symptoms then you could use ice to make
it<00:04:02.639> feel<00:04:02.940> better

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
it feel better

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.059 
it feel better
but<00:04:03.900> if<00:04:03.989> you<00:04:04.109> overdo<00:04:04.530> it<00:04:04.560> you<00:04:04.889> may

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
but if you overdo it you may

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.069 
but if you overdo it you may
unintentionally<00:04:05.569> slow<00:04:06.569> your<00:04:06.810> healing

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
unintentionally slow your healing

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.680 
unintentionally slow your healing
process<00:04:07.200> down<00:04:07.650> and<00:04:07.980> if<00:04:08.700> you<00:04:08.849> unfortunately

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
process down and if you unfortunately

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.050 
process down and if you unfortunately
succeed<00:04:10.349> in<00:04:10.650> stopping<00:04:11.010> all<00:04:11.430> inflammation

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
succeed in stopping all inflammation

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.720 
succeed in stopping all inflammation
with<00:04:12.989> ice<00:04:13.169> and<00:04:13.489> anti-inflammatories<00:04:14.489> and

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
with ice and anti-inflammatories and

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.759 
with ice and anti-inflammatories and
cortisone<00:04:15.180> shots<00:04:15.450> then<00:04:16.320> you've<00:04:16.500> basically

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
cortisone shots then you've basically

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.370 
cortisone shots then you've basically
stopped<00:04:17.340> your<00:04:17.519> healing<00:04:17.789> process<00:04:18.169> they<00:04:19.169> never
