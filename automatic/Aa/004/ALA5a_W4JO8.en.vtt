00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.590
 You will also find brand in the scene 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.600
 That's when you flee from the tank 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.280
 You just have to run this one here 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.990

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.280
 just follow the mission path 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.140
 times to the right and then here at the 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.280

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.210
