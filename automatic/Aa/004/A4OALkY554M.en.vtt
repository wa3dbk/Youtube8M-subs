00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.410 
probably the novel which i haven't read
and<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:46.350> you've<00:01:46.890> completed<00:01:47.430> pretty<00:01:48.060> much<00:01:48.240> the

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
and so you've completed pretty much the

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.870 
and so you've completed pretty much the
entire<00:01:48.509> journey<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.530> these<00:01:50.130> characters<00:01:50.430> as

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
entire journey of these characters as

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.330 
entire journey of these characters as
they<00:01:50.909> were<00:01:51.270> before<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:52.140> now<00:01:52.770> i'm<00:01:52.920> left<00:01:53.159> going

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
they were before and now i'm left going

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.639 
they were before and now i'm left going
what<00:01:53.759> happens<00:01:54.119> next<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.780> think<00:01:55.320> it's<00:01:55.409> setting

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
what happens next I think it's setting

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.760 
what happens next I think it's setting
up<00:01:55.770> for<00:01:55.890> some<00:01:56.070> shenanigans<00:01:56.600> every<00:01:57.600> week<00:01:58.439> and

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
up for some shenanigans every week and

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.139 
up for some shenanigans every week and
then<00:01:58.950> our<00:01:59.250> lead<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.490> going<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.790> come<00:01:59.939> in<00:02:00.060> and

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
then our lead is going to come in and

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.660 
then our lead is going to come in and
fix<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.600> all<00:02:00.780> with<00:02:00.810> his<00:02:00.990> his<00:02:01.530> charm<00:02:01.860> but

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
fix it all with his his charm but

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.740 
fix it all with his his charm but

happen so all I can really do is look at

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.790 
happen so all I can really do is look at
it<00:03:32.940> as<00:03:33.030> a<00:03:33.060> jumping-off<00:03:33.630> point<00:03:33.989> and<00:03:34.230> now<00:03:34.739> the

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
it as a jumping-off point and now the

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.220 
it as a jumping-off point and now the
show<00:03:35.130> is<00:03:35.160> essentially<00:03:35.760> reset<00:03:36.209> now<00:03:36.959> we're

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
show is essentially reset now we're

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.610 
show is essentially reset now we're
starting<00:03:37.560> from<00:03:37.860> episode<00:03:38.370> 2<00:03:38.880> into<00:03:39.810> something

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
starting from episode 2 into something

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.680 
starting from episode 2 into something
may<00:03:40.950> be<00:03:41.010> completely<00:03:41.459> different<00:03:41.910> and<00:03:42.030> so<00:03:42.420> I

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
may be completely different and so I

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.380 
may be completely different and so I
can't<00:03:43.470> tell<00:03:43.560> you<00:03:43.890> whether<00:03:44.100> or<00:03:44.220> not<00:03:44.459> that<00:03:45.120> means

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
can't tell you whether or not that means

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.840 
can't tell you whether or not that means
we<00:03:45.570> are<00:03:45.660> completely<00:03:46.170> out<00:03:46.290> of<00:03:46.440> ideas<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:47.280> we

clearly could be cook revolving a child

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.160 
clearly could be cook revolving a child
like<00:04:04.860> it<00:04:05.010> doesn't<00:04:05.190> matter<00:04:05.489> it's<00:04:06.030> a<00:04:06.209> title<00:04:07.050> and

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170
