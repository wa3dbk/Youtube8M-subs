the half hour left to go I understand it
Fernando<00:05:33.139> Torres<00:05:33.380> should<00:05:33.590> have<00:05:33.680> been<00:05:33.770> with

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
Fernando Torres should have been with

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.560 
Fernando Torres should have been with
the<00:05:33.979> one<00:05:34.100> substitute<00:05:34.550> but<00:05:35.000> because<00:05:35.330> his<00:05:35.419> name

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
the one substitute but because his name

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:36.909 
the one substitute but because his name
is<00:05:35.630> Fernando<00:05:36.080> Torres<00:05:36.289> of<00:05:36.530> course<00:05:36.740> he's<00:05:36.889> not

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 
is Fernando Torres of course he's not

is Fernando Torres of course he's not
substituted<00:05:37.700> I<00:05:37.849> guess<00:05:38.660> a<00:05:38.690> Hobson's<00:05:39.320> didn't

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800
