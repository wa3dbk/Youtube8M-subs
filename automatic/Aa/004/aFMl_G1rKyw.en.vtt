00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
this is the one piece clipping this is

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.520 
this is the one piece clipping this is
the<00:00:11.490> type<00:00:11.639> of<00:00:11.670> extension<00:00:12.450> that<00:00:12.960> you<00:00:13.019> can<00:00:13.290> put

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
in really quickly and easily doesn't

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.010 
in really quickly and easily doesn't
take<00:00:16.109> much<00:00:16.350> time<00:00:16.760> it<00:00:17.760> comes<00:00:18.150> in<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.539> body<00:00:18.779> wave

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
take much time it comes in a body wave

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.200 
take much time it comes in a body wave
so<00:00:19.500> this<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.340> texture<00:00:20.670> this<00:00:20.820> one's<00:00:21.029> been

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
so this is the texture this one's been

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.890 
so this is the texture this one's been
washed<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.689> few<00:00:21.930> times<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.850> just<00:00:24.269> kind<00:00:24.810> of

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
washed a few times and I just kind of

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.810 
washed a few times and I just kind of

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
brushed it out and air dried it but you

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.730 
brushed it out and air dried it but you
can<00:00:26.970> scrunch<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.750> it'll<00:00:27.930> have<00:00:28.199> much<00:00:28.500> more

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740
