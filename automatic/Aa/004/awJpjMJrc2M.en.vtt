shoots on top of the disc and then plug
the<00:00:45.660> blu-ray<00:00:46.050> back<00:00:46.260> in<00:00:46.440> as<00:00:46.559> if<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.829> put<00:00:46.860> it

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:13.780 

back<00:01:05.690> in<00:01:05.840> you<00:01:05.930> say

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.400 

I'll<00:01:14.790> suggest<00:01:15.060> for<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.570> bit<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.960> don't<00:01:16.170> use

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
I'll suggest for this bit you don't use

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.650 
I'll suggest for this bit you don't use
a<00:01:16.440> decent<00:01:16.770> CD<00:01:17.400> because<00:01:17.670> it's<00:01:17.850> gonna<00:01:18.000> skip

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
a decent CD because it's gonna skip

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.600 
a decent CD because it's gonna skip
around<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.110> little<00:01:19.230> bit<00:01:19.470> but<00:01:20.100> this<00:01:20.190> basically

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
around a little bit but this basically

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.430 
around a little bit but this basically
lets<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.880> see<00:01:21.180> if<00:01:21.300> you<00:01:21.450> blu-rays<00:01:21.900> working<00:01:22.320> as

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
lets you see if you blu-rays working as

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:29.470 
lets you see if you blu-rays working as
it<00:01:22.560> should<00:01:22.590> do<00:01:22.950> or<00:01:23.070> not<00:01:23.360> so<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.390> plug<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.810> in

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.480 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:36.290 

turn<00:01:30.480> it<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:33.260> and<00:01:34.260> now<00:01:34.730> you<00:01:35.730> watch<00:01:35.940> when<00:01:36.210> you

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
turn it on and now you watch when you

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.130 
turn it on and now you watch when you
put<00:01:36.480> the<00:01:36.600> disc<00:01:36.780> in<00:01:37.970> you<00:01:38.970> see<00:01:39.300> the<00:01:39.630> processes

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
put the disc in you see the processes

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.300 
put the disc in you see the processes
they'll<00:01:40.770> be<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.980> a<00:01:41.600> blue<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:43.440> blu-ray<00:01:43.860> comes<00:01:44.160> up

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
they'll be a a blue the blu-ray comes up

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.980 
they'll be a a blue the blu-ray comes up
and<00:01:44.460> reads<00:01:44.670> as<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.880> disc<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.420> then<00:01:45.540> after<00:01:45.870> that

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
and reads as a disc and then after that

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.650 
and reads as a disc and then after that
the<00:01:46.140> motor<00:01:46.350> is<00:01:46.500> spin<00:01:46.940> so<00:01:47.940> if<00:01:48.030> you've<00:01:48.180> got<00:01:48.330> fully

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
the motor is spin so if you've got fully

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.930 
the motor is spin so if you've got fully
laser<00:01:49.050> you'll<00:01:49.620> see<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.979> lens<00:01:50.190> bobbing<00:01:50.700> up<00:01:50.790> and

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
laser you'll see the lens bobbing up and

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.180 
laser you'll see the lens bobbing up and
down<00:01:51.050> trying<00:01:52.050> to<00:01:52.140> read<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.500> CD<00:01:52.860> but<00:01:53.010> there's

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
down trying to read the CD but there's

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.630 
down trying to read the CD but there's
no<00:01:53.310> laser<00:01:54.200> but<00:01:55.200> if<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.950> laser<00:01:56.190> is<00:01:56.370> alright

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
no laser but if the laser is alright

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
no laser but if the laser is alright
like<00:01:56.910> this<00:01:57.090> one<00:01:57.330> you<00:01:57.660> should<00:01:57.690> see<00:01:59.360> you<00:02:00.360> see<00:02:00.630> it

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
like this one you should see you see it

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.570 
like this one you should see you see it
blue<00:02:01.310> see<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.369> blue<00:02:02.610> light<00:02:04.369> realizing<00:02:05.369> it

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
blue see the blue light realizing it

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.570 
blue see the blue light realizing it
wasn't<00:02:05.880> bad<00:02:06.060> there's<00:02:06.720> a<00:02:06.869> ditch<00:02:07.080> there<00:02:07.490> and<00:02:08.490> the

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
wasn't bad there's a ditch there and the

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.600 
wasn't bad there's a ditch there and the
blue<00:02:08.760> rains<00:02:09.000> are<00:02:09.240> working<00:02:09.570> as<00:02:09.630> you<00:02:09.750> should<00:02:09.959> do

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
blue rains are working as you should do

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.310 
blue rains are working as you should do
now<00:02:11.610> because<00:02:11.760> this<00:02:12.000> is<00:02:12.060> another<00:02:12.300> way<00:02:12.840> of<00:02:13.260> using

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
now because this is another way of using

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:22.310 
now because this is another way of using
a<00:02:13.709> red<00:02:13.890> laser<00:02:17.810> yeah<00:02:20.870> if<00:02:21.870> you<00:02:21.959> haven't<00:02:22.110> got<00:02:22.290> that

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
a red laser yeah if you haven't got that

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.840 
a red laser yeah if you haven't got that
blue<00:02:22.650> light<00:02:23.660> then<00:02:24.660> it's<00:02:24.870> Shearer's<00:02:25.260> blu-rays

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
blue light then it's Shearer's blu-rays

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.190 
blue light then it's Shearer's blu-rays
gone<00:02:27.290> and<00:02:28.290> you<00:02:28.380> need<00:02:28.530> a<00:02:28.560> new<00:02:28.830> blu-ray<00:02:29.640> unit<00:02:30.239> and

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
gone and you need a new blu-ray unit and

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.050 
gone and you need a new blu-ray unit and
I've<00:02:31.320> actually<00:02:31.470> fitted<00:02:31.980> one<00:02:32.100> this<00:02:32.489> was<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.730> box

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
I've actually fitted one this was a box

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.820 
I've actually fitted one this was a box
it<00:02:33.239> coming<00:02:33.600> this<00:02:33.780> was<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.080> KS<00:02:34.530> 400<00:02:35.130> a<00:02:35.360> and<00:02:36.830> all

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
it coming this was the KS 400 a and all

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:46.880 
it coming this was the KS 400 a and all
it<00:02:38.070> was<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:45.420> odd<00:02:45.570> toward<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.200> camera<00:02:46.440> do<00:02:46.739> this

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
it was the odd toward the camera do this

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.470 
it was the odd toward the camera do this
at<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.130> same<00:02:47.160> time<00:02:49.790> there's<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.880> union<00:02:51.300> there

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
at the same time there's a union there

was literally the blu-ray laser went and

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.660 
was literally the blu-ray laser went and
you<00:02:57.959> there's<00:02:58.500> a<00:02:58.590> bit<00:02:58.830> of<00:02:58.920> plastic<00:02:59.280> you<00:02:59.340> change

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
on a worm drive and then one rod thread

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.340 
on a worm drive and then one rod thread
through<00:03:06.120> there<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.600> other<00:03:06.720> rod<00:03:07.019> thread

through there the other rod thread

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.320 
through there the other rod thread
through<00:03:07.620> this<00:03:07.800> side<00:03:08.100> and<00:03:08.790> then<00:03:08.940> you<00:03:08.970> plug<00:03:09.269> a

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
through this side and then you plug a

have to undo the five screws on here to

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.900 
have to undo the five screws on here to
take<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.330> top<00:03:15.540> off<00:03:15.690> and<00:03:16.310> then<00:03:17.310> take<00:03:17.610> the<00:03:17.760> rest

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910

it's<00:03:19.849> fairly<00:03:20.090> simple<00:03:20.420> to<00:03:20.690> do<00:03:20.840> but<00:03:21.380> stories

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
it's fairly simple to do but stories

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.440 
it's fairly simple to do but stories
made<00:03:21.980> sure<00:03:22.160> you've<00:03:22.340> got<00:03:22.520> the<00:03:22.610> disk<00:03:22.849> ejected

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
made sure you've got the disk ejected

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.170 
made sure you've got the disk ejected
before<00:03:24.050> you<00:03:24.380> try<00:03:24.560> and<00:03:24.680> take<00:03:24.800> it<00:03:25.010> apart<00:03:25.180> because

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
before you try and take it apart because

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.170 
before you try and take it apart because
otherwise<00:03:26.390> it<00:03:26.660> just<00:03:26.690> becomes<00:03:27.200> a<00:03:27.319> nightmare

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
otherwise it just becomes a nightmare

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.030 
otherwise it just becomes a nightmare
okay<00:03:29.180> but<00:03:29.480> another<00:03:29.690> thing<00:03:29.959> always<00:03:30.230> touch<00:03:30.680> just

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
okay but another thing always touch just

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.449 
okay but another thing always touch just
disconnect<00:03:32.030> Syria<00:03:32.330> and<00:03:32.810> that<00:03:33.680> one<00:03:33.860> now<00:03:34.069> none

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
disconnect Syria and that one now none

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.420
