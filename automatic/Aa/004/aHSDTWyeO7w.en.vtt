00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:13.419 
of motion now we've all drawn characters

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:16.830 
of motion now we've all drawn characters
in<00:00:13.870> this<00:00:14.110> position<00:00:15.209> standing<00:00:16.209> perfectly

conversation but by planning out the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.969 
conversation but by planning out the
line<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.670> motion<00:01:21.060> ahead<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.360> time<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.930> can<00:01:22.800> it

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
line of motion ahead of time you can it

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.160 
line of motion ahead of time you can it
you<00:01:23.610> can<00:01:23.759> have<00:01:23.820> characters<00:01:24.390> with<00:01:24.660> body

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
you can have characters with body

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.249 
you can have characters with body
language<00:01:25.790> you<00:01:26.790> can<00:01:26.820> be<00:01:27.119> communicating<00:01:27.990> things

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
language you can be communicating things

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.719 
language you can be communicating things
through<00:01:28.650> their<00:01:28.800> position<00:01:29.340> through<00:01:29.610> their

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
through their position through their

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:37.410 
through their position through their
stance<00:01:30.119> by<00:01:31.050> the<00:01:31.140> way<00:01:31.290> they<00:01:31.440> hold<00:01:31.619> themselves

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.469 

now<00:01:37.990> this<00:01:38.170> goes<00:01:38.439> to<00:01:39.009> even<00:01:39.369> greater<00:01:39.670> lengths<00:01:40.210> in

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
now this goes to even greater lengths in

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.550 
now this goes to even greater lengths in
an<00:01:40.900> action<00:01:41.200> sequence<00:01:41.580> see<00:01:42.780> here<00:01:43.780> is<00:01:43.869> a<00:01:43.900> kung<00:01:44.530> fu

an action sequence see here is a kung fu

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.740 
an action sequence see here is a kung fu
cha<00:01:45.360> now<00:01:46.360> this<00:01:46.659> is<00:01:46.720> a<00:01:46.899> by<00:01:47.290> no<00:01:47.350> means

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
cha now this is a by no means

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.609 
cha now this is a by no means
anatomically<00:01:49.750> correct<00:01:49.990> or<00:01:50.380> even

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
anatomically correct or even

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.730 
anatomically correct or even
proportional<00:01:51.280> what<00:01:52.000> it<00:01:52.090> does<00:01:52.270> have<00:01:52.540> is<00:01:52.899> a<00:01:53.080> flow

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
proportional what it does have is a flow

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.480 
proportional what it does have is a flow
it<00:01:54.610> has<00:01:54.759> a<00:01:54.789> line<00:01:55.210> of<00:01:55.450> motion<00:01:55.930> a<00:01:56.460> place<00:01:57.460> to

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
it has a line of motion a place to

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.550 
it has a line of motion a place to
direct<00:01:58.210> your<00:01:58.360> eye

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.190 

now<00:02:02.130> this<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.399> very<00:02:02.549> important<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.200> realize

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
now this is very important to realize

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.240 
now this is very important to realize
because<00:02:05.420> you<00:02:06.420> see<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.659> professional<00:02:07.439> type<00:02:07.979> r<00:02:08.160> as

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
starts drawing a character you know you

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.839 
starts drawing a character you know you
don't<00:02:12.690> see<00:02:12.989> him<00:02:13.140> drawing<00:02:13.440> these<00:02:14.250> uh<00:02:14.310> stick

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
don't see him drawing these uh stick

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
figures these lines of motion and while

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.110 
figures these lines of motion and while
that's<00:02:19.410> a<00:02:19.560> trick<00:02:19.830> that's<00:02:20.340> that's<00:02:20.670> not<00:02:20.849> the<00:02:20.970> way
