00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
tend to have really large ears so on the

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.400 
tend to have really large ears so on the
inside<00:00:31.310> of<00:00:31.340> the<00:00:31.520> ear<00:00:31.790> normally<00:00:32.629> I<00:00:32.660> usually<00:00:33.020> go

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
inside of the ear normally I usually go

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.709 
inside of the ear normally I usually go
a<00:00:33.710> closer<00:00:34.430> blade<00:00:34.790> on<00:00:34.940> the<00:00:35.030> inside<00:00:35.390> of<00:00:35.480> the<00:00:35.570> ear

go<00:02:25.880> against<00:02:26.709> against<00:02:27.709> the<00:02:27.890> grain<00:02:28.160> and<00:02:29.150> we'll

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
go against against the grain and we'll

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:40.970 
go against against the grain and we'll
go<00:02:29.390> to<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.980> outside<00:02:30.980> corner<00:02:31.370> of<00:02:31.519> the<00:02:31.610> eye
