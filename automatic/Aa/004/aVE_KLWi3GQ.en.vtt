house husband because you said there

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.040 
house husband because you said there
were<00:02:04.729> motors<00:02:05.060> they<00:02:05.179> weren't<00:02:05.390> like<00:02:05.600> servos

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
were motors they weren't like servos

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.350 
were motors they weren't like servos
well<00:02:06.679> there's<00:02:06.860> a<00:02:06.920> servo<00:02:07.280> for<00:02:07.460> steering<00:02:07.700> others

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
well there's a servo for steering others

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.180 
well there's a servo for steering others
and<00:02:08.750> there's<00:02:09.020> a<00:02:09.080> motor<00:02:09.560> up<00:02:09.679> in<00:02:09.800> motor<00:02:09.979> right

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
and there's a motor up in motor right

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.520 
and there's a motor up in motor right
there<00:02:10.429> okay<00:02:10.910> this<00:02:11.390> communicates<00:02:11.960> and<00:02:12.200> turns

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
there okay this communicates and turns

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.400 
there okay this communicates and turns
out<00:02:12.740> ok<00:02:13.520> it<00:02:13.850> just<00:02:14.060> over<00:02:14.420> you<00:02:14.660> some<00:02:14.870> troll<00:02:15.230> a

just 17 and the width actually itself
there's<00:02:36.680> all<00:02:36.800> sorts<00:02:37.010> of<00:02:37.070> ranges<00:02:37.400> from<00:02:37.550> slow<00:02:37.880> to

there's all sorts of ranges from slow to

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.090 
there's all sorts of ranges from slow to
fast<00:02:38.140> that's<00:02:39.140> we<00:02:39.290> actually<00:02:39.560> did<00:02:39.650> tweak<00:02:39.920> it

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
fast that's we actually did tweak it

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.890 
fast that's we actually did tweak it
because<00:02:40.310> we<00:02:40.400> were<00:02:40.490> going<00:02:40.670> too<00:02:40.880> fast<00:02:41.090> it

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900
