00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:54.460
 you introduce them so I put that as 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.800
 I have two sides and then it's gone 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.210
 the worst in ex bed so that's where I have 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.760

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.700
 on 113 and the little logos and the species 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:07.740
 of couple delta species not too much of 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:10.899
 relationship with delta group species 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.219

 face 

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:37.990

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.130
 are not more sprained than that in this 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.609
 happily there are three stars 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.609

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:46.740

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:53.619
 coyecques this besides it makes you think 

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:56.020

00:01:53.619 --> 00:02:00.609

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.929

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:05.240

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:07.549

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.069

 the pokemon itself is very beautiful 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.440

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.840
 beautiful and there I like a lot of 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.970

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.799
 that they come out of the water at a speed 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:28.840

 sympathy a little to the barrel 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.890
