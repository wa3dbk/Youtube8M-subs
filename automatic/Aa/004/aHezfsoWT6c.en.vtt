00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:17.990 
what do you think about this I'm not
very<00:06:16.500> optimistic<00:06:16.650> about<00:06:17.280> the<00:06:17.550> transfer

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
very optimistic about the transfer

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.899 
very optimistic about the transfer
window<00:06:18.120> but<00:06:18.870> there<00:06:19.169> is<00:06:19.289> always<00:06:19.710> hope<00:06:19.740> that<00:06:20.460> we

00:06:20.899 --> 00:06:20.909 
window but there is always hope that we

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:23.570 
window but there is always hope that we
might<00:06:21.150> sign<00:06:21.539> two<00:06:22.409> or<00:06:22.590> three<00:06:22.830> players<00:06:23.099> who

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
might sign two or three players who

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:24.190 
might sign two or three players who
really

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:24.200 
really

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.050 
really
work<00:06:24.350> out<00:06:24.590> who<00:06:24.920> really<00:06:25.190> hit<00:06:25.700> the<00:06:25.850> ground

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.060 
work out who really hit the ground

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.230 
work out who really hit the ground
running<00:06:26.330> and<00:06:26.690> then<00:06:26.960> maybe<00:06:27.860> just<00:06:28.130> maybe<00:06:28.520> we<00:06:28.850> can

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.240 
running and then maybe just maybe we can

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.670 
running and then maybe just maybe we can
get<00:06:29.420> back<00:06:29.690> into<00:06:29.960> the<00:06:30.200> Champions<00:06:30.620> League

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680
