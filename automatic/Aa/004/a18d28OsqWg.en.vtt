00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
 two 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.950
 i 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.640
 or the chemistry of today we are going to premiere 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.949
 my new notebook or arthur nal but only 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.920
 dedicated to watercolors or water 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:42.920
 color is this special skin mill that 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.440
 It is made of paper for watercolors and 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.800
 I think we 're going to inaugurate it with a 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.540
 galaxy 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.079
 like the paper for watercolors I'm going to 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.960
 paint everything I will fasten the sheet to the 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.120
 first sheet of notebook to my board 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.280
 which I always use when I use a little bit of 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.890
 water so that the leaf does not move 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.559
 that can control it a little better 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.340
 now we prepare a little the colors of 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.810
 my sakura watercolors being a bit of 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.780
 the colors that I'm going to use that are going to be 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:18.869
 blue yellow red and violet we wet the 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.580
 surface of the paper first with water 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.600
 clean and then we apply 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.070
 color details so you leave 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.840
 vanishing a little 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.830
 first imagine how the 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.600
 galaxy that they will want to draw no no 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.600
 do not leave everything totally left to the 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.160
 chance a Jaen where that will be 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.530
 nebula that is always in all 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.080
 galaxies and so it's going to be easier than 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.320
 can achieve it is a job that 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.409
 they have to think about layers by painting a 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.240
 base they let it dry or dry it with the 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.250
 heat gun 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.439
 and then they apply it with more color and 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.580
 more color and colors the key is that we 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.860
 when they start to apply colors 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.430
 go I'm doing the paper 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.320
 are applying clean water before 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.690
 re-apply the color that way 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.320
 all the colors are going to mix between 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:15.170
 yes in a couple way they also have 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.680
 than to avoid the remaining lines 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.810
 well marked 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.579
 and for that they have to wet the brush 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.090
 with water and where is a marked line 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:26.730
 a very marked color change wet with 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.730
 clean water and that's going to make it 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.400
 blur and make the middle line 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.730
 diffuse and if they do not achieve it only with water 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.480
 with a wet wipe of those 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.909
 we clean the stamps they also support in 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.810
 that place and they will see that they are going to 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:47.810
 help the lines are not left 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.810
 very marked 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:12.290
 but no 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.120
 now I want to add a little bit of white 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.980
 to mark the nebula then use I'll 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.000
 to start to really try all the 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.640
 whites that I have 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.849
 first the white gelato marked the 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.500
 galaxy and smudges a bit with your fingers 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.750
 I added a little water also 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.910
 dry with the heat gun then with 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.040
 the labaro of hero wars 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.010
 I mix it in an acrylic block and I 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.070
 I put water and I sprinkled with a brush 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.060
 to generate the stars on the 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.340
 galaxies 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.890
 I keep adding water and I keep blurring 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.750
 the lines as I said before always 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.060
 adding water does not matter that they have already 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.000
 put the stars the stars in 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.970
 a galaxy are in a bunch of planes 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.570
 creating water to blur 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:22.060
 and we are going to try another white color for 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:25.030
 splash even more with stars now that 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.310
 we have finished the galaxy we are going to 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.170
 be giving you a sentence above the 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.050
 image as to transform it also 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:36.129
 in a bow watercolors a bad day 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.629
 the phrase that I chose to print is written 

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:39.970
 in the stars that is a book of 

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:42.699
 Sidney Sheldon that I loved it 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.220
 very much and I read it when I was little but 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:48.909
 We are going to record it on paper 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:51.759
 transparent graphite or bellum in with 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:54.370
 powders for white prints and we're going 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:56.710
 to stamp some stars up to 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.650
 that put the stand stamp set 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:03.190
 persan anonymous world text that is a 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:06.039
 alphabet as spent but that when 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.590
 we are talking about it in super 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:11.740
 cute then to stamp the stars 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:14.469
 we use white ink of hero wards of 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:17.319
 pigment color and unicorn that the set of 

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:20.440
 simon stamps says stand up cupcake 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:23.139
 party that has three stars we are going to 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:26.110
 use those stars to give you a 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:28.300
 little bit of tonality once you have 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.479
 we have we mark around helping us 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.139
 a bit with the rule you and another little with 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:36.800
 the surface 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:39.259
 of work that has a grid we are going to 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.439
 mark a white line with our 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:45.499
 unibol gel pen to give you a 

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:48.169
 edge to this box is not easy to write 

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:50.569
 in a straight line with a gel pen and 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:52.279
 - using a rule but it does not matter 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:53.650
 because I do not want it to be perfect 

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:56.979
 termination 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:59.410
 once we have it finished or what 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:01.680
 we terminate what we have to give 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:04.530
 go to the 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.500
 the sheet of the journal and for that we use 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:10.830
 the tomball standard that can be used 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.960
 as a runner or as dragging 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:15.900
 on paper what is going to do that 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:19.729
 leave a line of glue or like a 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:22.259
 pointer if we stop it on tip over 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:25.169
 about what we want to apply a 

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:27.960
 square nothing more than the glue and what 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:30.870
 we go down we leave only one 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.520
 square and in this case I hide it 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.479
 behind the letters so you do not see 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:38.580
 because the paper is transparent and ready 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:41.550
 this is the first arsenal of watercolors 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:43.139
 I had planned to build to release 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.490
 this notebook I hope you have them 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:46.470
 liked 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:50.009
 here I also leave you two links to the
