you

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.829 

so<00:00:05.589> now<00:00:05.770> that<00:00:05.950> we<00:00:06.069> have<00:00:06.100> all<00:00:06.549> the<00:00:07.149> pieces<00:00:07.359> on

00:00:07.829 --> 00:00:07.839 
so now that we have all the pieces on

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:10.049 
so now that we have all the pieces on
this<00:00:08.019> cube<00:00:08.260> salt<00:00:08.559> but<00:00:08.769> a<00:00:08.980> we<00:00:09.430> just<00:00:09.640> have<00:00:09.790> to<00:00:09.910> now

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:10.059 
this cube salt but a we just have to now

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:13.289 
this cube salt but a we just have to now
work<00:00:10.480> on<00:00:10.750> these<00:00:11.049> edge<00:00:11.349> pairs<00:00:11.860> are<00:00:12.759> these<00:00:13.030> edge

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:13.299 
work on these edge pairs are these edge

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.520 
work on these edge pairs are these edge
pieces<00:00:13.900> I'm<00:00:14.259> sorry<00:00:14.530> so<00:00:15.690> do<00:00:16.690> that<00:00:16.870> you<00:00:17.230> want<00:00:17.350> to

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:17.530 
pieces I'm sorry so do that you want to

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.590 
pieces I'm sorry so do that you want to
first<00:00:17.800> get<00:00:18.039> to<00:00:18.369> that<00:00:18.699> are<00:00:18.850> adjacent<00:00:18.939> to<00:00:19.480> each

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:19.600 
first get to that are adjacent to each

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.509 
first get to that are adjacent to each
other<00:00:19.840> to<00:00:20.080> match<00:00:20.260> up<00:00:20.529> not<00:00:20.680> only<00:00:20.710> here<00:00:21.099> but<00:00:21.250> with

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:21.519 
other to match up not only here but with

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:23.880 
other to match up not only here but with
the<00:00:21.609> sides<00:00:21.880> here<00:00:22.269> it<00:00:23.260> doesn't<00:00:23.500> look<00:00:23.590> like<00:00:23.680> I

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
the sides here it doesn't look like I

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.189 
the sides here it doesn't look like I
have<00:00:24.099> any<00:00:24.340> so<00:00:24.910> i'm<00:00:25.720> going<00:00:25.840> to<00:00:25.900> show<00:00:26.080> you<00:00:26.109> an

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:26.199 
have any so i'm going to show you an

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.249 
have any so i'm going to show you an
algorithm<00:00:26.769> it's<00:00:26.980> pretty<00:00:27.400> simple<00:00:27.789> and<00:00:28.259> it'll

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:29.259 
algorithm it's pretty simple and it'll

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.090 
algorithm it's pretty simple and it'll
move<00:00:29.650> i'll<00:00:30.550> show<00:00:31.060> you<00:00:31.150> what<00:00:31.300> pieces<00:00:31.509> will<00:00:31.779> move

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:32.100 
move i'll show you what pieces will move

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.459 
move i'll show you what pieces will move
it'll<00:00:33.100> take<00:00:33.460> this<00:00:33.940> front<00:00:34.390> edge<00:00:34.750> piece<00:00:35.170> here

00:00:35.459 --> 00:00:35.469 
it'll take this front edge piece here

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:38.549 
it'll take this front edge piece here
and<00:00:35.710> move<00:00:36.160> it<00:00:36.280> to<00:00:36.309> the<00:00:36.460> back<00:00:37.020> well<00:00:38.020> is<00:00:38.230> this

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 
and move it to the back well is this

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:40.740 
and move it to the back well is this
back<00:00:39.129> edge<00:00:39.370> piece<00:00:39.670> here<00:00:39.940> and<00:00:40.120> move<00:00:40.420> it<00:00:40.570> to<00:00:40.600> the

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
back edge piece here and move it to the

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.600 
back edge piece here and move it to the
front<00:00:40.780> of<00:00:41.079> the<00:00:41.140> opposite<00:00:41.559> side<00:00:41.800> so<00:00:42.340> it<00:00:42.399> kind<00:00:42.579> of

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
front of the opposite side so it kind of

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.010 
front of the opposite side so it kind of
makes<00:00:42.760> an<00:00:42.910> X<00:00:43.180> through<00:00:43.420> the<00:00:43.660> middle<00:00:43.899> of<00:00:43.930> the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
makes an X through the middle of the

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.600 
makes an X through the middle of the
cube<00:00:44.350> and<00:00:44.710> I'll<00:00:44.800> show<00:00:44.980> you<00:00:45.070> what<00:00:45.160> that<00:00:45.219> what

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
cube and I'll show you what that what

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.549 
cube and I'll show you what that what
this<00:00:45.730> will<00:00:45.910> do<00:00:46.030> so<00:00:46.629> I<00:00:46.660> want<00:00:46.899> this<00:00:47.020> white<00:00:47.320> yellow

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
this will do so I want this white yellow

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.310 
this will do so I want this white yellow
piece<00:00:47.920> to<00:00:48.309> go<00:00:48.430> on<00:00:48.550> the<00:00:48.670> yellow<00:00:48.820> side<00:00:49.120> here<00:00:49.420> so<00:00:50.289> I

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
piece to go on the yellow side here so I

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.930 
piece to go on the yellow side here so I
want<00:00:50.530> the<00:00:50.620> yellow<00:00:50.860> sign<00:00:51.190> in<00:00:51.280> the<00:00:51.399> back<00:00:51.579> right

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
want the yellow sign in the back right

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.770 
want the yellow sign in the back right
here<00:00:52.000> and<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:54.520> do<00:00:54.640> this<00:00:54.820> this<00:00:55.420> is<00:00:55.660> the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
here and to do this this is the

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.880 
here and to do this this is the
algorithm<00:00:56.410> you<00:00:56.620> will<00:00:56.770> be<00:00:56.920> using<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:58.600> is<00:00:59.079> a<00:00:59.109> B

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
algorithm you will be using it is a B

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:09.420 
algorithm you will be using it is a B
minus<00:01:00.160> R<00:01:01.920> B<00:01:02.920> plus<00:01:03.190> T<00:01:04.059> plus<00:01:04.420> r<00:01:06.210> t-<00:01:07.210> and<00:01:08.400> take<00:01:09.400> a

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
minus R B plus T plus r t- and take a

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.870 
minus R B plus T plus r t- and take a
look<00:01:09.580> that<00:01:10.210> was<00:01:10.420> easy<00:01:11.250> now<00:01:12.250> that<00:01:12.490> we<00:01:12.670> have<00:01:12.700> that

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
look that was easy now that we have that

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.330 
look that was easy now that we have that
done<00:01:13.300> we<00:01:13.510> want<00:01:13.870> to<00:01:13.960> find<00:01:14.200> another<00:01:14.800> one<00:01:15.070> to<00:01:15.190> do

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
done we want to find another one to do

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.710 
done we want to find another one to do
so<00:01:15.700> I'm<00:01:15.820> going<00:01:15.970> to<00:01:16.000> find<00:01:16.210> another<00:01:16.420> one<00:01:16.570> the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
so I'm going to find another one the

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.980 
so I'm going to find another one the
bottom<00:01:16.990> that's<00:01:17.230> orange<00:01:17.650> one<00:01:18.240> put<00:01:19.240> it<00:01:19.360> opposite

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
bottom that's orange one put it opposite

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.470 
bottom that's orange one put it opposite
the<00:01:20.020> orange<00:01:20.530> side<00:01:20.680> so<00:01:21.040> i'll<00:01:21.250> put<00:01:21.520> my<00:01:21.670> orange<00:01:22.150> in

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:22.480 
the orange side so i'll put my orange in

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.830 
the orange side so i'll put my orange in
front<00:01:22.900> my<00:01:23.560> orange<00:01:24.040> orange<00:01:25.030> corners<00:01:25.450> in<00:01:25.750> the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
front my orange orange corners in the

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.350 
front my orange orange corners in the
back<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:27.070> i'll<00:01:27.190> perform<00:01:27.340> the<00:01:27.640> same<00:01:27.880> algorithm

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
back and i'll perform the same algorithm

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.830 
back and i'll perform the same algorithm
again<00:01:28.570> be<00:01:29.290> mines<00:01:29.560> are<00:01:31.170> B<00:01:32.170> plus<00:01:33.150> I'm<00:01:34.150> sorry<00:01:34.390> T

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
again be mines are B plus I'm sorry T

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.410 
again be mines are B plus I'm sorry T
plus<00:01:35.110> B<00:01:35.410> plus<00:01:36.300> R

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
plus B plus R

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.170 
plus B plus R
t<00:01:39.110> months<00:01:40.540> and<00:01:41.540> take<00:01:42.530> a<00:01:42.560> look<00:01:42.770> we<00:01:43.369> have<00:01:43.490> to<00:01:43.759> edge

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
t months and take a look we have to edge

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.020 
t months and take a look we have to edge
pieces<00:01:44.509> already<00:01:44.840> solved<00:01:45.759> alright<00:01:46.759> so<00:01:46.909> now

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
pieces already solved alright so now

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.660 
pieces already solved alright so now
that<00:01:47.210> we<00:01:47.299> have<00:01:47.409> two<00:01:48.409> of<00:01:48.890> these<00:01:49.070> edge<00:01:49.340> pieces

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
that we have two of these edge pieces

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.570 
that we have two of these edge pieces
already<00:01:50.210> in<00:01:50.479> place<00:01:50.720> it's<00:01:51.530> time<00:01:51.649> to<00:01:51.890> get<00:01:52.009> to<00:01:52.549> the

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
already in place it's time to get to the

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.310 
already in place it's time to get to the
other<00:01:52.820> two<00:01:53.030> edge<00:01:53.210> pieces<00:01:53.479> up<00:01:53.780> here<00:01:54.020> not

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
other two edge pieces up here not

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.070 
other two edge pieces up here not
necessarily<00:01:54.860> in<00:01:55.009> the<00:01:55.310> right<00:01:55.520> place<00:01:56.119> but<00:01:56.840> up

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
necessarily in the right place but up

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.620 
necessarily in the right place but up
here<00:01:57.140> so<00:01:57.890> we<00:01:58.130> could<00:01:58.220> have<00:01:58.399> in<00:01:58.759> this<00:01:58.940> case<00:01:59.210> the

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
here so we could have in this case the

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.170 
here so we could have in this case the
yellow<00:02:00.470> one<00:02:00.680> here<00:02:01.070> and<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:01.399> orange<00:02:01.729> one<00:02:01.939> here

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
yellow one here and the orange one here

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.350 
yellow one here and the orange one here
we<00:02:02.299> just<00:02:02.450> want<00:02:02.600> them<00:02:02.720> up<00:02:02.780> here<00:02:02.990> first<00:02:03.200> so<00:02:04.240> to<00:02:05.240> do

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
we just want them up here first so to do

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.840 
we just want them up here first so to do
that<00:02:05.390> you'd<00:02:06.140> algorithm<00:02:06.680> you're<00:02:07.430> going<00:02:07.610> to<00:02:07.670> do

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
that you'd algorithm you're going to do

that you'd algorithm you're going to do
what<00:02:08.390> it's<00:02:08.539> going<00:02:08.690> to<00:02:08.750> switch<00:02:09.200> or<00:02:09.679> these<00:02:09.920> two

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
what it's going to switch or these two

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.280 
what it's going to switch or these two
pieces<00:02:10.640> right<00:02:11.030> here<00:02:11.090> this<00:02:11.480> edge<00:02:11.720> in<00:02:11.930> that<00:02:11.959> edge

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
pieces right here this edge in that edge

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.800 
pieces right here this edge in that edge
as<00:02:12.890> well<00:02:13.160> as<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:13.489> edge<00:02:13.640> on<00:02:13.880> the<00:02:14.150> top<00:02:14.360> right<00:02:14.660> and

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
as well as the edge on the top right and

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.550 
as well as the edge on the top right and
the<00:02:15.260> edge<00:02:15.350> on<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.709> bottom<00:02:16.040> left<00:02:16.250> so<00:02:17.410> you<00:02:18.410> don't

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
the edge on the bottom left so you don't

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.289 
the edge on the bottom left so you don't
have<00:02:18.620> to<00:02:18.739> move<00:02:18.980> pieces<00:02:19.340> around<00:02:19.549> a<00:02:19.970> bit

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
have to move pieces around a bit

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.539 
have to move pieces around a bit
logically<00:02:21.019> but<00:02:21.650> I<00:02:21.709> think<00:02:21.950> you<00:02:22.010> can<00:02:22.130> understand

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
logically but I think you can understand

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:24.430 
logically but I think you can understand
it<00:02:22.730> and<00:02:22.790> I<00:02:22.850> put<00:02:23.090> it<00:02:23.209> in<00:02:23.239> the<00:02:23.330> hardest<00:02:23.720> case<00:02:24.019> so

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
it and I put it in the hardest case so

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.229 
it and I put it in the hardest case so
that<00:02:24.470> if<00:02:24.980> you<00:02:25.100> can<00:02:25.220> understand<00:02:25.670> this<00:02:25.790> one<00:02:26.060> you

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
that if you can understand this one you

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:27.640 
that if you can understand this one you
should<00:02:26.420> be<00:02:26.510> able<00:02:26.569> to<00:02:26.750> understand<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.290> rest<00:02:27.470> of

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
should be able to understand the rest of

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.520 
should be able to understand the rest of
them<00:02:27.769> so<00:02:28.400> what<00:02:29.360> I'm<00:02:29.450> going<00:02:29.569> to<00:02:29.630> do<00:02:29.780> I'm<00:02:30.470> going

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
them so what I'm going to do I'm going

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.160 
them so what I'm going to do I'm going
to<00:02:30.650> take<00:02:30.830> this<00:02:31.130> one<00:02:31.340> it<00:02:31.700> here<00:02:32.060> and<00:02:32.660> move<00:02:32.900> it<00:02:33.049> up

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
to take this one it here and move it up

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.580 
to take this one it here and move it up
here<00:02:33.470> so<00:02:34.190> I<00:02:34.220> could<00:02:34.340> adjust<00:02:34.850> this<00:02:35.180> one<00:02:35.590> down

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
here so I could adjust this one down

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.949 
here so I could adjust this one down
here<00:02:36.850> so<00:02:37.850> that<00:02:38.000> when<00:02:38.150> i<00:02:38.180> do<00:02:38.269> the<00:02:38.510> algorithm

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
here so that when i do the algorithm

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.140 
here so that when i do the algorithm
again<00:02:39.230> this<00:02:39.739> on<00:02:40.069> white<00:02:40.430> piece<00:02:40.700> which<00:02:40.910> is<00:02:41.030> then

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
again this on white piece which is then

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.789 
again this on white piece which is then
it<00:02:41.269> will<00:02:41.420> let<00:02:41.540> me<00:02:41.720> up<00:02:41.840> there<00:02:41.870> can<00:02:42.380> come<00:02:42.590> down

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
it will let me up there can come down

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.190 
it will let me up there can come down
next<00:02:43.070> to<00:02:43.340> that<00:02:43.430> one<00:02:43.750> so<00:02:44.750> that<00:02:44.840> when<00:02:45.019> i<00:02:45.049> get

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
next to that one so that when i get

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.960 
next to that one so that when i get
these<00:02:45.320> two<00:02:45.590> next<00:02:45.739> to<00:02:45.950> each<00:02:46.010> other<00:02:46.220> they<00:02:46.820> can

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
these two next to each other they can

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.819 
these two next to each other they can
come<00:02:47.150> up<00:02:47.269> to<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:47.480> top<00:02:47.660> layer<00:02:47.989> sounds

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
come up to the top layer sounds

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:50.319 
come up to the top layer sounds
confusing<00:02:49.190> but<00:02:49.310> here's<00:02:49.640> what<00:02:49.820> i'll<00:02:50.000> show<00:02:50.269> you

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
confusing but here's what i'll show you

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.599 
confusing but here's what i'll show you
how<00:02:50.420> you<00:02:50.660> do<00:02:50.840> it<00:02:50.989> so<00:02:51.680> i<00:02:51.709> have<00:02:51.920> one<00:02:52.459> of<00:02:52.519> my<00:02:52.579> pieces

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:52.609 
how you do it so i have one of my pieces

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:55.690 
how you do it so i have one of my pieces
under<00:02:53.150> here<00:02:53.390> in<00:02:53.480> this<00:02:53.600> case<00:02:53.900> and<00:02:54.250> i'm<00:02:55.250> going<00:02:55.579> to

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
under here in this case and i'm going to

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:07.930 
under here in this case and i'm going to
do<00:02:55.850> a<00:02:57.430> b-minus<00:02:58.430> or<00:02:59.829> b<00:03:00.829> minus<00:03:01.220> 3<00:03:02.950> r-b<00:03:03.950> +<00:03:04.510> t<00:03:05.510> +<00:03:05.780> r<00:03:06.940> t

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
rt6 r t- and now what that did is it let

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.590 
rt6 r t- and now what that did is it let
me<00:03:27.440> put<00:03:27.709> this<00:03:27.739> white<00:03:28.190> piece<00:03:28.400> up<00:03:28.670> here<00:03:28.700> so<00:03:29.480> i<00:03:29.540> can

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
me put this white piece up here so i can

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.630 
me put this white piece up here so i can
drop<00:03:29.959> it<00:03:30.230> down<00:03:30.380> back<00:03:30.620> into<00:03:30.890> this<00:03:31.010> layer<00:03:31.250> next

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
drop it down back into this layer next

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.309 
drop it down back into this layer next
to<00:03:31.760> this<00:03:31.880> piece<00:03:32.209> which<00:03:32.480> sets<00:03:32.840> me<00:03:33.019> up<00:03:33.049> for<00:03:33.140> the

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
to this piece which sets me up for the

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.349 
to this piece which sets me up for the
last<00:03:33.440> step<00:03:33.739> as<00:03:34.220> you<00:03:34.400> want<00:03:34.549> to<00:03:34.639> try<00:03:34.790> to<00:03:34.850> aim<00:03:35.060> for

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
last step as you want to try to aim for

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:37.059 
last step as you want to try to aim for
these<00:03:35.810> two<00:03:36.049> wedges<00:03:36.230> to<00:03:36.440> be<00:03:36.590> next<00:03:36.769> to<00:03:36.920> each

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
these two wedges to be next to each

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.990 
these two wedges to be next to each
other<00:03:37.569> so<00:03:38.569> now<00:03:38.840> I<00:03:39.590> have<00:03:39.950> this<00:03:40.100> piece<00:03:40.400> up<00:03:40.609> here<00:03:40.639> I

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
other so now I have this piece up here I

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.930 
other so now I have this piece up here I
want<00:03:41.690> to<00:03:41.780> take<00:03:41.989> this<00:03:42.200> once<00:03:42.920> drop<00:03:43.280> it<00:03:43.310> down<00:03:43.609> here

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
want to take this once drop it down here

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.240 
want to take this once drop it down here
but<00:03:44.569> if<00:03:45.109> you<00:03:45.260> want<00:03:45.470> to<00:03:45.530> get<00:03:45.590> this<00:03:45.769> next<00:03:46.010> to<00:03:46.130> that

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
but if you want to get this next to that

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.710 
but if you want to get this next to that
piece<00:03:46.459> you<00:03:46.489> don't<00:03:46.909> want<00:03:47.120> this<00:03:47.269> piece<00:03:47.569> over

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
piece you don't want this piece over

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.449 
piece you don't want this piece over
here<00:03:47.870> because<00:03:48.500> this<00:03:48.830> piece<00:03:49.069> is<00:03:49.250> going<00:03:49.400> to

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
here because this piece is going to

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:50.740 
here because this piece is going to
switch<00:03:49.819> with<00:03:50.000> that<00:03:50.150> one<00:03:50.360> this

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
switch with that one this

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.990 
switch with that one this
so<00:03:51.380> make<00:03:51.530> sure<00:03:51.560> it's<00:03:51.860> over<00:03:52.070> here<00:03:52.340> and<00:03:52.610> now<00:03:52.760> over

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
so make sure it's over here and now over

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000 
so make sure it's over here and now over
there<00:03:53.180> I'm<00:03:53.960> going<00:03:54.080> to<00:03:54.140> just<00:03:54.290> do<00:03:54.440> the<00:03:54.590> algorithm

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
there I'm going to just do the algorithm

going to switch these two right here
this<00:05:22.220> is<00:05:22.370> your<00:05:22.520> front<00:05:22.930> the<00:05:23.930> algorithm<00:05:24.440> is<00:05:24.530> very

this is your front the algorithm is very

this is your front the algorithm is very
similar<00:05:25.010> starts<00:05:25.520> the<00:05:25.669> same<00:05:25.880> way<00:05:25.940> the<00:05:26.419> last<00:05:26.630> one

but<00:05:26.990> it's<00:05:27.140> a<00:05:27.229> little<00:05:27.410> shorter<00:05:27.979> and<00:05:28.070> it<00:05:28.130> changes

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.530 
but it's a little shorter and it changes
halfway<00:05:29.090> so<00:05:29.720> we'll<00:05:30.680> start<00:05:30.770> off<00:05:30.950> with<00:05:31.160> same<00:05:31.340> way

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:31.540
