now<00:01:17.729> with<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.000> being<00:01:18.119> said<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:18.990> still<00:01:19.170> a

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
now with that being said this is still a

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.410 
now with that being said this is still a
nice<00:01:19.409> nice<00:01:19.950> figure<00:01:20.310> price<00:01:20.790> point<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.150> think<00:01:21.270> is

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
nice nice figure price point I think is

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.420 
nice nice figure price point I think is
about<00:01:21.600> 20<00:01:21.990> 199<00:01:22.710> right<00:01:23.549> around<00:01:23.820> their

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
about 20 199 right around their

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.760 
about 20 199 right around their
instructions<00:01:26.430> are<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:27.560> standard<00:01:28.560> beast

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
instructions are the standard beast

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.819 
instructions are the standard beast

just kind of gives you a quick rundown

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.090 
just kind of gives you a quick rundown
of<00:01:34.290> how<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.189> use<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.750> whatnot<00:01:37.020> but<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.950> the

of how to use it and whatnot but and the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.830 
of how to use it and whatnot but and the
smokescreen<00:01:38.460> figure<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.030> kind<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.360> cool<00:01:39.509> so

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
smokescreen figure is kind of cool so

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:48.950 
smokescreen figure is kind of cool so
here<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:45.409> so<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:47.340> one<00:01:47.520> thing<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.360> was<00:01:48.930> a

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
here it is so the one thing that I was a

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.490 
here it is so the one thing that I was a
little<00:01:49.200> confused<00:01:49.560> about<00:01:49.710> there<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.579> no<00:01:51.110> way<00:01:52.110> or

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
little confused about there is no way or

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.670 
little confused about there is no way or
where<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.399> instructions<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.149> shows

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
where and the instructions that it shows

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.060 
where and the instructions that it shows
him<00:01:55.710> smokescreen<00:01:56.640> being<00:01:57.149> in<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.659> cockpit<00:01:58.200> he

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
him smokescreen being in the cockpit he

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.280 
him smokescreen being in the cockpit he
fits<00:01:59.810> but<00:02:01.100> horribly<00:02:02.100> so<00:02:02.750> when<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.810> open<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.170> up

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
fits but horribly so when you open it up

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.880 
fits but horribly so when you open it up
it<00:02:05.009> opens<00:02:05.100> right<00:02:05.369> up<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:06.680> there's<00:02:07.680> like<00:02:07.710> this

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
it opens right up and there's like this

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.309 
it opens right up and there's like this
a<00:02:07.950> ramp<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:08.970> put<00:02:09.450> them<00:02:09.509> in<00:02:09.629> car<00:02:09.810> mode<00:02:10.020> and

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
a ramp so I put them in car mode and

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.850 
a ramp so I put them in car mode and
just<00:02:10.530> sit<00:02:10.679> them<00:02:10.800> right<00:02:11.009> on<00:02:11.190> there

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
just sit them right on there

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.770 
just sit them right on there
and<00:02:11.980> then<00:02:12.160> obviously<00:02:12.310> you<00:02:12.790> can<00:02:13.090> close<00:02:13.270> this<00:02:13.450> no

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
and then obviously you can close this no

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.480 
and then obviously you can close this no
problem<00:02:13.810> so<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:14.530> guys<00:02:14.740> can<00:02:14.890> see<00:02:15.070> that<00:02:15.100> but

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
problem so you guys can see that but

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.290 
problem so you guys can see that but
I'll<00:02:16.000> take<00:02:16.150> them<00:02:16.300> out<00:02:16.420> and<00:02:17.970> let's<00:02:18.970> just<00:02:19.090> push

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
I'll take them out and let's just push

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.540 
I'll take them out and let's just push
this<00:02:19.450> off<00:02:19.660> to<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:19.840> side<00:02:19.900> for<00:02:20.050> a<00:02:20.260> second<00:02:20.620> and

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
this off to the side for a second and

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.620 
this off to the side for a second and
show<00:02:21.730> you<00:02:21.790> smokescreen<00:02:22.680> so<00:02:24.000> he's<00:02:25.000> cool<00:02:25.210> I<00:02:25.390> mean

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
show you smokescreen so he's cool I mean

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.690 
show you smokescreen so he's cool I mean
I<00:02:25.900> I<00:02:26.290> definitely<00:02:26.920> like<00:02:27.040> gonna<00:02:27.220> make<00:02:27.550> sure<00:02:27.670> I

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
I I definitely like gonna make sure I

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.660 
I I definitely like gonna make sure I
get<00:02:27.790> some<00:02:27.850> refocus<00:02:28.390> here<00:02:28.570> I<00:02:28.780> like<00:02:29.440> a<00:02:29.670> neat

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
get some refocus here I like a neat

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.870 
get some refocus here I like a neat
little<00:02:30.820> figure<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:33.010> know<00:02:33.130> real<00:02:33.430> simple<00:02:33.790> to

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
little figure you know real simple to

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.510 
little figure you know real simple to
transform<00:02:34.390> is<00:02:34.600> all<00:02:34.900> these<00:02:35.130> Legion<00:02:36.130> figures

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
transform is all these Legion figures

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:44.780 
transform is all these Legion figures
are<00:02:36.790> fold<00:02:37.630> these<00:02:37.840> down<00:02:42.720> folds<00:02:43.720> back

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
are fold these down folds back

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.040 
are fold these down folds back
these<00:02:45.790> actually<00:02:46.450> you<00:02:46.600> want<00:02:46.780> to<00:02:46.840> make<00:02:46.930> sure

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
these actually you want to make sure

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.560 
these actually you want to make sure
these<00:02:47.200> are<00:02:47.290> up<00:02:47.590> because<00:02:48.100> this<00:02:48.310> is<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.570> correct

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
these are up because this is the correct

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.860 
these are up because this is the correct
way<00:02:49.750> you<00:02:49.810> swing<00:02:50.170> down<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.500> arm<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:52.450> there<00:02:52.750> it

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
way you swing down the arm and there it

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.949 
way you swing down the arm and there it
is<00:02:52.930> cuz<00:02:53.200> he<00:02:53.290> has<00:02:53.440> these<00:02:54.450> he<00:02:55.450> has<00:02:55.570> to<00:02:55.690> have<00:02:55.810> these

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
is cuz he has these he has to have these

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.010 
is cuz he has these he has to have these
little<00:02:56.230> wings<00:02:57.120> door<00:02:58.120> wings<00:02:58.360> I<00:02:58.720> guess<00:02:58.900> you

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
little wings door wings I guess you

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.550 
little wings door wings I guess you
could<00:02:59.170> say

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
could say

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.090 
could say
so<00:02:59.980> this<00:03:00.130> smokescreen<00:03:01.230> he's<00:03:02.230> cool<00:03:02.440> you<00:03:02.980> know

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
so this smokescreen he's cool you know

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:11.810 
so this smokescreen he's cool you know
he's<00:03:03.220> a<00:03:03.280> cool<00:03:03.459> little<00:03:03.550> figure<00:03:03.940> can<00:03:04.690> carries<00:03:05.110> oh

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.750 

there<00:03:12.820> we<00:03:12.880> go<00:03:13.260> carry<00:03:14.260> his<00:03:14.380> little<00:03:14.590> weapon<00:03:14.920> he's

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
there we go carry his little weapon he's

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.140 
there we go carry his little weapon he's
cool

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
cool

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.470 
cool
now<00:03:16.600> as<00:03:16.870> for<00:03:17.019> putting<00:03:17.290> him<00:03:17.380> in<00:03:17.500> here<00:03:18.360> you<00:03:19.360> give

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
now as for putting him in here you give

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.990 
now as for putting him in here you give
me<00:03:19.570> the<00:03:19.660> weapon<00:03:19.900> in<00:03:19.989> his<00:03:20.080> hand<00:03:20.700> open<00:03:21.700> it<00:03:21.970> up<00:03:24.000> and

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
me the weapon in his hand open it up and

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.180 
me the weapon in his hand open it up and
that's<00:03:25.120> what<00:03:25.239> you<00:03:25.390> get<00:03:26.280> so<00:03:27.510> this<00:03:28.510> doesn't<00:03:29.190> it

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
that's what you get so this doesn't it

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.000 
that's what you get so this doesn't it
if<00:03:30.580> you<00:03:30.730> squish<00:03:31.570> it<00:03:31.600> it<00:03:31.930> will<00:03:32.110> shut<00:03:32.290> just<00:03:32.560> fine

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
if you squish it it will shut just fine

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.699 
if you squish it it will shut just fine
but<00:03:33.549> he's<00:03:33.670> all<00:03:33.820> crooked<00:03:34.480> so<00:03:34.720> what<00:03:35.230> you<00:03:35.380> really

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
but he's all crooked so what you really

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.539 
but he's all crooked so what you really
can<00:03:35.890> do<00:03:36.040> is<00:03:36.250> you<00:03:37.090> can<00:03:37.269> kind<00:03:38.049> of<00:03:38.250> miss<00:03:39.250> transform

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
can do is you can kind of miss transform

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.910 
can do is you can kind of miss transform
him<00:03:39.970> if<00:03:40.120> you<00:03:40.239> want<00:03:40.480> or<00:03:40.810> just<00:03:41.110> kind<00:03:41.590> of<00:03:41.620> angle

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
him if you want or just kind of angle

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.789 
him if you want or just kind of angle
these<00:03:42.010> up<00:03:42.220> a<00:03:42.310> little<00:03:42.340> bit<00:03:42.700> and<00:03:43.690> then<00:03:44.200> kind<00:03:44.709> of

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
these up a little bit and then kind of

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.949 
these up a little bit and then kind of
squeeze<00:03:45.220> him<00:03:45.370> in<00:03:45.489> there<00:03:45.730> maybe<00:03:46.450> lay<00:03:46.690> the<00:03:46.840> gun

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
squeeze him in there maybe lay the gun

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.229 
squeeze him in there maybe lay the gun
across<00:03:47.200> his<00:03:47.320> lap<00:03:47.680> I<00:03:47.980> mean<00:03:48.190> he<00:03:48.310> doesn't<00:03:48.700> he

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
across his lap I mean he doesn't he

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.570 
across his lap I mean he doesn't he
doesn't<00:03:49.269> fit<00:03:49.660> in<00:03:49.780> there<00:03:49.900> really<00:03:50.500> well

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
doesn't fit in there really well

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:57.440 
doesn't fit in there really well
I<00:03:51.640> spun<00:03:52.420> these<00:03:52.630> around<00:03:54.540> show<00:03:55.540> you<00:03:55.720> like<00:03:56.140> this

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
I spun these around show you like this

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.670 
I spun these around show you like this
and<00:03:58.450> then<00:03:58.630> kind<00:03:58.870> of<00:03:58.900> have<00:03:59.080> them<00:03:59.200> hanging<00:03:59.530> down

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
and then kind of have them hanging down

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.770 
and then kind of have them hanging down
like<00:03:59.709> this<00:04:00.130> this<00:04:01.030> is<00:04:01.239> actually<00:04:01.360> the<00:04:01.600> way<00:04:01.690> he

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
like this this is actually the way he

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.979 
like this this is actually the way he
comes<00:04:02.019> in<00:04:02.140> the<00:04:02.200> box<00:04:02.470> and<00:04:02.799> then<00:04:03.549> maybe<00:04:04.510> you<00:04:04.840> can

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
comes in the box and then maybe you can

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.910 
comes in the box and then maybe you can
kind<00:04:05.440> of<00:04:05.500> get<00:04:06.070> him<00:04:06.190> in<00:04:06.310> there<00:04:06.519> I<00:04:07.829> don't<00:04:08.829> know

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
kind of get him in there I don't know

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.000 
kind of get him in there I don't know
something<00:04:09.790> like<00:04:09.910> this<00:04:10.440> you<00:04:11.440> know<00:04:11.560> looks<00:04:11.890> like

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
something like this you know looks like

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.229 
something like this you know looks like
he's<00:04:12.130> in<00:04:12.220> a<00:04:12.280> coffin<00:04:13.500> not<00:04:14.500> a<00:04:14.560> fan<00:04:14.799> but

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
he's in a coffin not a fan but

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.530 
he's in a coffin not a fan but
regardless<00:04:16.590> he's<00:04:17.590> cool<00:04:17.910> you<00:04:18.910> know<00:04:19.030> as<00:04:19.239> a

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
regardless he's cool you know as a

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.700 
regardless he's cool you know as a
figure<00:04:20.459> you<00:04:21.459> can<00:04:21.669> definitely<00:04:21.970> get<00:04:22.599> him<00:04:22.780> in

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
figure you can definitely get him in

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.409 
figure you can definitely get him in
here<00:04:24.190> it's<00:04:24.430> just

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
here it's just

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.089 
here it's just
kind<00:04:25.659> of<00:04:25.749> maneuvering<00:04:26.409> in<00:04:26.590> the<00:04:26.710> proper<00:04:27.069> way

00:04:27.089 --> 00:04:27.099 
kind of maneuvering in the proper way

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:29.520 
kind of maneuvering in the proper way
and<00:04:27.610> like<00:04:28.210> I<00:04:28.360> said<00:04:28.419> if<00:04:28.719> you<00:04:28.840> wanted<00:04:29.050> to<00:04:29.199> squeeze

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
and like I said if you wanted to squeeze

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.610 
and like I said if you wanted to squeeze
it<00:04:29.680> down<00:04:29.939> he<00:04:30.939> will<00:04:31.120> fit<00:04:31.419> it's<00:04:31.749> just<00:04:32.080> it<00:04:32.409> almost

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
it down he will fit it's just it almost

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.469 
it down he will fit it's just it almost
seems<00:04:32.919> like<00:04:33.159> there's<00:04:33.460> like<00:04:33.639> little<00:04:33.999> cutouts

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
seems like there's like little cutouts

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:37.019 
seems like there's like little cutouts
