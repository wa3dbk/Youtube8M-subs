and<00:01:50.470> narrower<00:01:51.190> and<00:01:51.700> it<00:01:52.120> would<00:01:52.330> have<00:01:52.450> been<00:01:52.570> very

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
and narrower and it would have been very

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.610 
and narrower and it would have been very
very<00:01:53.770> close<00:01:54.600> unfortunately<00:01:55.600> it's<00:01:55.930> a<00:01:56.110> bit<00:01:56.320> wide

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
very close unfortunately it's a bit wide

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.180 
very close unfortunately it's a bit wide
for<00:01:57.220> his<00:01:57.250> body<00:01:57.700> frame<00:01:58.440> but<00:01:59.440> it<00:01:59.590> still<00:01:59.920> looks

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
for his body frame but it still looks

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.070 
for his body frame but it still looks
reasonable<00:02:00.940> guys<00:02:01.150> I<00:02:01.480> don't<00:02:01.540> know<00:02:01.750> what<00:02:01.960> you

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
reasonable guys I don't know what you

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.720 
reasonable guys I don't know what you
think<00:02:02.320> let<00:02:02.560> me<00:02:02.710> know<00:02:02.860> what<00:02:03.010> you<00:02:03.130> think<00:02:03.340> betting

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 
think let me know what you think betting

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.060 
think let me know what you think betting
game<00:02:04.030> it<00:02:04.300> will<00:02:04.870> still<00:02:05.200> look<00:02:05.230> very<00:02:05.500> much<00:02:06.010> like

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
game it will still look very much like

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.639 
game it will still look very much like
them<00:02:06.400> because<00:02:06.580> the<00:02:06.940> proportions<00:02:07.600> seem<00:02:08.320> to

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
them because the proportions seem to

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.190 
them because the proportions seem to
come<00:02:08.800> back<00:02:09.130> in<00:02:09.399> game<00:02:09.850> so<00:02:10.570> therefore<00:02:10.960> if<00:02:11.050> he's

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
come back in game so therefore if he's

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.140 
come back in game so therefore if he's
