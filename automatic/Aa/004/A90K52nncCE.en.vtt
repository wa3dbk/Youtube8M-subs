00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.900

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.829
 the works come together to ask

 You must know the truth of this question 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.900

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.760

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.130
 with his own words the teacher is 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.139
 very specific with your instructions that 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.820
