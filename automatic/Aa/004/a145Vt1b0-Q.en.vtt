that's one thing he's kind of behind on
right<00:00:17.820> now<00:00:20.359> one<00:00:21.359> thing<00:00:21.539> I've<00:00:21.660> actually

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
right now one thing I've actually

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.439 
right now one thing I've actually
noticed<00:00:22.410> that<00:00:22.560> my<00:00:22.710> third<00:00:23.130> at<00:00:23.670> my<00:00:23.970> planetary

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
noticed that my third at my planetary

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.570 
noticed that my third at my planetary
fortress<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.080> in<00:00:25.529> future<00:00:25.740> games<00:00:25.949> i'm<00:00:26.369> really

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
fortress and in future games i'm really

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.400 
fortress and in future games i'm really
going<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.730> prevent<00:00:27.060> this<00:00:27.240> he<00:00:27.840> almost<00:00:28.050> had

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
going to prevent this he almost had

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.990 
going to prevent this he almost had
enough<00:00:28.680> mainly<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.220> kill<00:00:29.400> my<00:00:29.519> planetary

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
enough mainly to kill my planetary

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.580 
enough mainly to kill my planetary
fortress<00:00:30.420> right<00:00:30.599> there<00:00:30.810> but<00:00:31.050> didn't<00:00:31.349> manage

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
fortress right there but didn't manage

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.620 
fortress right there but didn't manage
to<00:00:31.619> take<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.040> out<00:00:32.160> so<00:00:32.969> one<00:00:33.239> thing<00:00:33.480> I'm

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
to take it out so one thing I'm

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.850 
to take it out so one thing I'm
definitely<00:00:33.870> going<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.260> do<00:00:34.350> in<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.530> future<00:00:34.680> is

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
definitely going to do in the future is

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.250 
definitely going to do in the future is
build<00:00:35.430> supply<00:00:35.820> depots<00:00:36.180> along<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.870> southern

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
build supply depots along the southern

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.470 
build supply depots along the southern
line<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.800> my<00:00:38.219> planetary<00:00:38.640> fortress<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.329> that

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
line of my planetary fortress so that

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.910 
line of my planetary fortress so that
main<00:00:39.629> legs<00:00:39.840> aren't<00:00:39.989> able<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.290> just<00:00:40.559> smash

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
main legs aren't able to just smash

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.860 
main legs aren't able to just smash
directly<00:00:41.579> into<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.879> planetary<00:00:42.329> fortress<00:00:42.719> and

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
directly into the planetary fortress and

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.889 
directly into the planetary fortress and
then<00:00:43.469> also<00:00:43.680> have<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.010> huge<00:00:44.489> tank<00:00:44.789> behind<00:00:45.539> the

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
then also have a huge tank behind the

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.569 
then also have a huge tank behind the
planetary<00:00:46.379> fortress<00:00:46.829> in<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.280> event<00:00:47.520> that

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
planetary fortress in the event that

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.439 
planetary fortress in the event that
somebody<00:00:48.059> tries<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.480> do<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:49.140> baneling<00:00:50.449> smash

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
somebody tries to do to a baneling smash

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.450 
somebody tries to do to a baneling smash
through<00:00:51.899> on<00:00:52.079> your<00:00:52.110> planetary<00:00:52.680> forces<00:00:53.010> it's<00:00:53.370> a

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
through on your planetary forces it's a

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.700 
through on your planetary forces it's a
really<00:00:53.760> good<00:00:53.879> idea<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.480> do<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.199> little<00:00:55.410> bit<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.590> a

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
really good idea to do a little bit of a

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.529 
really good idea to do a little bit of a
sim<00:00:55.920> city<00:00:56.160> around<00:00:56.489> your<00:00:56.699> planetary<00:00:57.059> fortress

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
sim city around your planetary fortress

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.279 
sim city around your planetary fortress
and<00:00:57.719> prevent<00:00:58.730> ferment<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.969> fan<00:01:00.930> links<00:01:01.199> from

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
and prevent ferment the fan links from

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.969 
and prevent ferment the fan links from
just<00:01:01.500> hitting<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.160> straight<00:01:02.430> line<00:01:03.979> just

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
just hitting it in a straight line just

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.590 
just hitting it in a straight line just
pick<00:01:05.159> up<00:01:05.280> all<00:01:05.489> those<00:01:05.610> Fester's<00:01:06.180> right<00:01:06.360> there<00:01:06.570> I

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
pick up all those Fester's right there I

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:26.030 
pick up all those Fester's right there I
was<00:01:06.900> really<00:01:07.530> big

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.330 

I<00:01:26.130> think

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.249 

he's<00:01:32.340> also<00:01:32.610> gone<00:01:33.000> up<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.329> hive<00:01:33.539> at<00:01:33.780> this<00:01:33.960> point

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
he's also gone up to hive at this point

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.179 
he's also gone up to hive at this point
and<00:01:34.500> he<00:01:35.210> has<00:01:36.210> an<00:01:36.420> ultra-low<00:01:36.869> stand<00:01:37.140> down<00:01:37.500> he

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
and he has an ultra-low stand down he

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.459 
and he has an ultra-low stand down he
has<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.310> second<00:01:38.759> hatchery<00:01:39.060> at<00:01:39.179> his<00:01:39.329> natural<00:01:39.810> he

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:40.469 
has a second hatchery at his natural he

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:42.499 
has a second hatchery at his natural he
actually<00:01:40.619> has<00:01:40.890> two<00:01:41.189> ultralisk<00:01:41.789> caverns<00:01:42.270> I

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
actually has two ultralisk caverns I

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.389 
actually has two ultralisk caverns I
never<00:01:42.899> noticed<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.439> he<00:01:43.710> has<00:01:43.829> one<00:01:44.130> at<00:01:44.280> his

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
never noticed that he has one at his

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.100 
never noticed that he has one at his
third<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.630> one<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.350> fifi

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
third and and and one it is fifi

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.840 
third and and and one it is fifi
probably<00:01:49.110> just<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.289> little<00:01:49.409> bit<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.679> nerves<00:01:49.950> a

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
probably just a little bit of nerves a

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.389 
probably just a little bit of nerves a
little<00:01:51.390> bit<00:01:51.539> too<00:01:52.259> fast<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.829> clicking<00:01:55.399> because

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
little bit too fast of clicking because

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.190 
little bit too fast of clicking because
that<00:01:56.579> is<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.789> quite<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.390> bit<00:01:57.569> right<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.929> ultra

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
that is a quite a bit right the ultra

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.840 
that is a quite a bit right the ultra
karen<00:01:58.619> is<00:01:58.679> not<00:01:58.920> one<00:01:59.069> of<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.219> cheaper<00:01:59.579> zor

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
karen is not one of the cheaper zor

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:17.240 
karen is not one of the cheaper zor
structures<00:02:00.539> correct<00:02:02.360> yeah<00:02:03.360> it's<00:02:03.539> 150<00:02:04.289> 200

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.440 

right<00:02:18.250> now<00:02:18.370> I'm<00:02:18.489> starting<00:02:18.849> to<00:02:18.909> make<00:02:19.090> doors

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
right now I'm starting to make doors

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.300 
right now I'm starting to make doors
into<00:02:19.810> my<00:02:19.930> army<00:02:20.230> because<00:02:20.530> I<00:02:20.709> know<00:02:20.769> that<00:02:21.190> the

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
into my army because I know that the

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.400 
into my army because I know that the
whole<00:02:21.370> chills<00:02:21.670> are<00:02:21.790> coming<00:02:22.090> on

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
whole chills are coming on

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.080 
whole chills are coming on
much<00:02:23.560> more<00:02:23.740> than<00:02:23.890> Robert<00:02:24.130> having<00:02:24.370> forehead<00:02:24.790> he

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
much more than Robert having forehead he

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.640 
much more than Robert having forehead he
keeps<00:02:25.330> doing<00:02:25.570> these<00:02:25.810> aggressive<00:02:26.170> laying

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
keeps doing these aggressive laying

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.860 
keeps doing these aggressive laying
around<00:02:26.890> five<00:02:27.070> but<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:28.120> positioning<00:02:28.660> of<00:02:28.750> my

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
around five but the positioning of my

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.080 
around five but the positioning of my
buildings<00:02:29.350> actually<00:02:29.770> just<00:02:30.040> made<00:02:30.190> it<00:02:30.310> much

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
buildings actually just made it much

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.120 
buildings actually just made it much
