00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
behind the counter in a safe that is

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.279 
behind the counter in a safe that is
hard<00:04:30.280> so<00:04:30.910> you<00:04:31.000> have<00:04:31.090> to<00:04:31.180> have<00:04:31.300> 75<00:04:31.780> lock-picking

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:32.289 
hard so you have to have 75 lock-picking

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:35.700 
hard so you have to have 75 lock-picking
to<00:04:32.620> even<00:04:32.889> get<00:04:33.010> in<00:04:33.130> there<00:04:33.570> but<00:04:34.570> I<00:04:34.870> mean<00:04:35.500> it's

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
to even get in there but I mean it's

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.500 
to even get in there but I mean it's
pretty<00:04:35.830> worth<00:04:36.070> it<00:04:36.280> the<00:04:36.460> reload<00:04:36.849> is<00:04:36.880> really

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
pretty worth it the reload is really

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.310 
pretty worth it the reload is really
slow<00:04:37.780> as<00:04:38.110> you<00:04:38.289> will<00:04:38.440> see<00:04:38.650> and<00:04:39.810> this<00:04:40.810> safe<00:04:41.080> also

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
slow as you will see and this safe also

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.770 
slow as you will see and this safe also
has<00:04:41.590> a<00:04:41.620> bunch<00:04:41.800> of<00:04:41.919> other<00:04:42.010> stuff<00:04:42.389> the<00:04:43.389> reload<00:04:43.750> is

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780

guess<00:05:01.319> not<00:05:01.830> as<00:05:01.979> fast<00:05:02.190> as<00:05:02.370> like<00:05:02.550> a<00:05:02.580> repeater<00:05:03.120> or

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
guess not as fast as like a repeater or

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.409 
guess not as fast as like a repeater or
something<00:05:03.720> like<00:05:03.870> that<00:05:04.639> but<00:05:05.639> see<00:05:06.060> this<00:05:06.180> is<00:05:06.300> what

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
something like that but see this is what

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.510 
something like that but see this is what
I<00:05:06.449> mean<00:05:06.569> about<00:05:06.630> the<00:05:06.930> reload<00:05:07.289> you<00:05:07.440> gotta<00:05:07.620> reload

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
I mean about the reload you gotta reload

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.510 
I mean about the reload you gotta reload
it<00:05:08.729> like<00:05:08.880> one<00:05:09.120> bullet<00:05:09.449> at<00:05:09.599> a<00:05:09.630> time<00:05:10.250> and<00:05:11.250> if<00:05:11.400> I'm

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
it like one bullet at a time and if I'm

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.670 
it like one bullet at a time and if I'm
in<00:05:11.639> combat<00:05:12.120> that'd<00:05:12.330> be<00:05:12.479> kind<00:05:12.720> of<00:05:12.750> annoying<00:05:12.960> but

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
in combat that'd be kind of annoying but

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.059 
in combat that'd be kind of annoying but
it<00:05:13.830> is<00:05:13.949> kind<00:05:14.160> of<00:05:14.220> cool<00:05:14.400> it's<00:05:15.000> got<00:05:15.240> a<00:05:15.270> I<00:05:16.069> think

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:17.069 
it is kind of cool it's got a I think

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:20.300 
it is kind of cool it's got a I think
it's<00:05:17.280> an<00:05:17.370> ivory<00:05:17.819> handle<00:05:18.169> with<00:05:19.169> a<00:05:19.380> club

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
it's an ivory handle with a club

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.080 
it's an ivory handle with a club
actually<00:05:20.610> on<00:05:20.849> the<00:05:20.970> side<00:05:21.210> but
