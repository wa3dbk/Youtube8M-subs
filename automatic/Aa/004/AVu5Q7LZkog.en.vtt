fluttering in the background fletching
is<00:00:35.550> actually<00:00:35.880> pretty<00:00:36.059> profitable<00:00:36.480> at<00:00:36.630> the

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
is actually pretty profitable at the

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.729 
is actually pretty profitable at the
moment<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.170> that's<00:00:37.290> what<00:00:37.410> I'm<00:00:37.500> going<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.649> be

moment so that's what I'm going to be
doing<00:00:37.829> for<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.100> little<00:00:38.190> bit<00:00:38.370> i'm<00:00:39.300> only<00:00:39.600> doing

water<00:01:38.220> build<00:01:38.490> up<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.329> test<00:01:39.810> was<00:01:40.070> keeping

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
water build up and the test was keeping

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.690 
water build up and the test was keeping
pressure<00:01:41.310> distance<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.390> volume<00:01:42.570> so

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
pressure distance and volume so

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.770 
pressure distance and volume so
everybody<00:01:44.700> had<00:01:45.000> their<00:01:45.119> own<00:01:45.180> things<00:01:45.570> some

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.550 
better and there was a me my partner's
turn<00:02:37.260> so<00:02:37.590> we<00:02:38.489> go<00:02:38.670> up<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:39.120> at<00:02:39.840> first<00:02:40.140> we<00:02:40.319> only

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
turn so we go up and at first we only

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.440 
turn so we go up and at first we only
have<00:02:40.799> like<00:02:40.950> one<00:02:40.980> nozzle<00:02:41.400> on<00:02:41.700> ours<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.209> then

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
have like one nozzle on ours and then

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.780 
have like one nozzle on ours and then
for<00:02:42.720> some<00:02:42.870> reason<00:02:42.930> we<00:02:43.260> decided<00:02:43.379> to<00:02:43.830> add<00:02:44.129> a<00:02:44.190> tea

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
for some reason we decided to add a tea

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.059 
for some reason we decided to add a tea
on<00:02:44.970> it<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:45.360> add<00:02:45.599> another<00:02:45.930> nozzle<00:02:46.410> so<00:02:46.890> we<00:02:46.950> had

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
on it and add another nozzle so we had

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.220 
on it and add another nozzle so we had
two<00:02:47.250> nozzles<00:02:47.489> shooting<00:02:48.480> out<00:02:48.630> and<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:48.989> way<00:02:49.079> we

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
two nozzles shooting out and the way we

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.920 
two nozzles shooting out and the way we
had<00:02:49.440> it<00:02:49.489> we<00:02:50.489> took<00:02:50.700> earplugs<00:02:51.299> the<00:02:51.569> string<00:02:51.810> one

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
had it we took earplugs the string one

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.420 
had it we took earplugs the string one
ear<00:02:52.110> plugs<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:52.620> we<00:02:52.709> wrapped<00:02:52.980> it<00:02:53.099> around<00:02:53.160> the

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
ear plugs and we wrapped it around the

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.220 
ear plugs and we wrapped it around the
two<00:02:53.579> nozzles<00:02:53.790> so<00:02:54.360> when<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.599> would<00:02:54.690> shoot<00:02:55.019> they

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
two nozzles so when it would shoot they

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.530 
two nozzles so when it would shoot they
would<00:02:55.349> shoot<00:02:55.530> in<00:02:55.680> like<00:02:55.890> an<00:02:56.040> X<00:02:56.250> form<00:02:56.610> so<00:02:57.120> the

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
would shoot in like an X form so the

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.390 
would shoot in like an X form so the
bottom<00:02:57.870> nozzle<00:02:58.200> shoot<00:02:58.440> upwards<00:02:58.829> and<00:02:59.069> the

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
bottom nozzle shoot upwards and the

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.699 
bottom nozzle shoot upwards and the
upper<00:02:59.670> nozzle<00:03:00.030> shoot<00:03:00.239> downwards<00:03:00.930> it<00:03:01.530> was

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
upper nozzle shoot downwards it was

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.940 
upper nozzle shoot downwards it was
really<00:03:01.980> cool<00:03:02.660> and<00:03:03.660> I<00:03:04.170> mean<00:03:04.379> we<00:03:04.500> didn't<00:03:04.739> we

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
really cool and I mean we didn't we

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.979 
really cool and I mean we didn't we
didn't<00:03:05.129> win<00:03:05.250> either<00:03:05.430> of<00:03:05.730> those<00:03:05.879> but<00:03:06.150> if<00:03:06.750> we

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
didn't win either of those but if we

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.509 
didn't win either of those but if we
would<00:03:07.170> have<00:03:07.200> if<00:03:07.680> there<00:03:07.860> was<00:03:07.950> like<00:03:08.069> a<00:03:08.099> design

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
would have if there was like a design

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:09.800 
would have if there was like a design
contest<00:03:09.030> we<00:03:09.120> probably<00:03:09.299> would<00:03:09.480> have<00:03:09.540> worn<00:03:09.720> now

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
contest we probably would have worn now

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.809 
contest we probably would have worn now

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
basically they took an expansion tank

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:27.979 
basically they took an expansion tank
and<00:03:23.690> installed<00:03:24.690> it<00:03:24.870> on<00:03:25.079> to<00:03:26.120> just<00:03:27.120> one<00:03:27.510> big<00:03:27.750> line

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
and installed it on to just one big line

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.640 
and installed it on to just one big line
of<00:03:28.130> copper<00:03:29.130> ok<00:03:29.880> and<00:03:30.090> then<00:03:30.569> from<00:03:31.109> the<00:03:31.200> copper

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
of copper ok and then from the copper

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.270 
of copper ok and then from the copper
what<00:03:32.190> they<00:03:32.340> did<00:03:32.519> was<00:03:32.549> they<00:03:32.940> took<00:03:33.750> it<00:03:34.230> and<00:03:34.410> ran

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
what they did was they took it and ran

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.599 
what they did was they took it and ran
like<00:03:35.670> maybe<00:03:36.420> like<00:03:36.599> three<00:03:36.989> feet<00:03:37.200> of<00:03:37.349> copper

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
like maybe like three feet of copper

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:40.520 
like maybe like three feet of copper
into<00:03:38.609> soft<00:03:39.090> tubing<00:03:39.599> copper<00:03:40.049> which<00:03:40.319> is

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
into soft tubing copper which is

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.789 
into soft tubing copper which is
basically<00:03:41.069> like<00:03:41.400> three-eighths<00:03:42.299> of<00:03:42.450> an<00:03:42.569> inch

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
basically like three-eighths of an inch

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.650 
basically like three-eighths of an inch
and<00:03:43.799> when<00:03:44.400> you<00:03:44.459> want<00:03:44.639> to<00:03:44.700> go<00:03:44.790> for<00:03:44.970> distance<00:03:45.450> you

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
and when you want to go for distance you

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.360 
and when you want to go for distance you
don't<00:03:45.840> want<00:03:45.959> to<00:03:46.019> have<00:03:46.230> you<00:03:46.410> know<00:03:46.530> a<00:03:46.560> big<00:03:47.069> gaping

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
don't want to have you know a big gaping

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.390 
don't want to have you know a big gaping
hole<00:03:47.760> giggity<00:03:48.329> you<00:03:49.260> want<00:03:49.440> to<00:03:49.530> have<00:03:49.709> as<00:03:50.010> small

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
hole giggity you want to have as small

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.909 
hole giggity you want to have as small
as<00:03:50.519> well<00:03:50.639> as<00:03:50.849> possible<00:03:51.359> so<00:03:51.660> Moore<00:03:52.470> will<00:03:52.500> shoot

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
as well as possible so Moore will shoot

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.129 
as well as possible so Moore will shoot
out<00:03:53.069> at<00:03:53.310> a<00:03:53.340> longer<00:03:53.700> distance<00:03:53.819> it<00:03:54.269> just<00:03:54.450> you

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
out at a longer distance it just you

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:58.909 
out at a longer distance it just you
know<00:03:55.290> just<00:03:55.680> make<00:03:55.859> sense<00:03:56.190> so<00:03:57.349> they<00:03:58.349> go<00:03:58.590> and<00:03:58.859> they

00:03:58.909 --> 00:03:58.919 
know just make sense so they go and they

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:01.879 
know just make sense so they go and they
set<00:03:59.489> their<00:03:59.669> expansion<00:04:00.150> tank<00:04:00.389> and<00:04:00.630> they<00:04:01.590> set<00:04:01.859> it

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
set their expansion tank and they set it

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:04.220 
set their expansion tank and they set it
to<00:04:02.160> 40<00:04:02.579> psi<00:04:03.180> which<00:04:03.480> is<00:04:03.630> the<00:04:03.750> pressure<00:04:03.989> it's

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
to 40 psi which is the pressure it's

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.569 
to 40 psi which is the pressure it's
going<00:04:04.349> to<00:04:04.410> shoot<00:04:04.560> at<00:04:04.680> us<00:04:04.709> so<00:04:05.010> they<00:04:05.130> had<00:04:05.280> I<00:04:05.310> had<00:04:05.549> a

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
going to shoot at us so they had I had a

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.069 
going to shoot at us so they had I had a
water<00:04:05.849> connection<00:04:06.359> and<00:04:06.540> they<00:04:06.599> had<00:04:06.780> an<00:04:06.900> air

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
water connection and they had an air

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.430 
water connection and they had an air
connection<00:04:07.620> which<00:04:08.609> they<00:04:09.599> first<00:04:09.930> shut<00:04:10.139> off<00:04:10.290> the

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
connection which they first shut off the

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.520 
connection which they first shut off the
word<00:04:10.620> connection<00:04:11.069> which<00:04:11.250> one<00:04:11.489> about<00:04:12.019> 45<00:04:13.019> ish

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
word connection which one about 45 ish

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.289 
word connection which one about 45 ish
or<00:04:13.889> so<00:04:13.950> inches<00:04:14.930> and<00:04:15.930> then<00:04:16.400> they<00:04:17.400> added<00:04:17.849> the

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
or so inches and then they added the

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.839 
or so inches and then they added the
water<00:04:18.539> and<00:04:18.870> the<00:04:19.019> air<00:04:19.049> test<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:20.130> expansion

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:20.849 
water and the air test the expansion

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:24.050 
water and the air test the expansion
tank<00:04:21.090> edit<00:04:21.930> shot<00:04:22.320> like<00:04:22.530> 73<00:04:23.430> or<00:04:23.669> something<00:04:23.940> like

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
tank edit shot like 73 or something like

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.900 
tank edit shot like 73 or something like
that<00:04:24.120> and<00:04:24.570> they

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
that and they

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.370 
that and they
that<00:04:25.120> we<00:04:25.330> already<00:04:25.840> knew<00:04:25.960> they<00:04:26.080> were<00:04:26.170> going<00:04:26.290> to

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
that we already knew they were going to

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.720 
that we already knew they were going to
win<00:04:26.500> like<00:04:26.680> there<00:04:26.860> was<00:04:27.010> no<00:04:27.040> coming<00:04:27.550> back<00:04:27.580> from

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
win like there was no coming back from

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.270 
win like there was no coming back from
that<00:04:27.910> so<00:04:28.720> they<00:04:28.930> they<00:04:29.260> took<00:04:29.500> off<00:04:29.680> they<00:04:29.920> won<00:04:30.130> with

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
that so they they took off they won with

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.120 
that so they they took off they won with
that<00:04:30.490> and<00:04:30.790> then<00:04:30.820> the<00:04:31.540> volume<00:04:31.900> test<00:04:32.170> was<00:04:32.440> uh<00:04:32.650> to

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
that and then the volume test was uh to

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.310 
that and then the volume test was uh to
see<00:04:33.370> how<00:04:33.580> fast<00:04:33.850> somebody<00:04:34.240> could<00:04:34.600> shoot<00:04:35.050> their

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
see how fast somebody could shoot their

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.160 
see how fast somebody could shoot their
water<00:04:35.800> gone<00:04:36.010> into<00:04:36.790> this<00:04:37.030> like<00:04:37.270> tin<00:04:37.690> can<00:04:37.960> and

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.170 
water gone into this like tin can and

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.650 
water gone into this like tin can and
see<00:04:38.320> who<00:04:38.470> could<00:04:38.650> fill<00:04:39.250> it<00:04:39.370> up<00:04:39.460> first<00:04:39.730> edit<00:04:40.540> it

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
see who could fill it up first edit it

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.270 
see who could fill it up first edit it
took<00:04:40.870> them<00:04:41.050> like<00:04:41.200> five<00:04:41.440> seconds<00:04:41.920> to<00:04:42.040> fill<00:04:42.190> it

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
took them like five seconds to fill it

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.800 
took them like five seconds to fill it
up<00:04:42.340> not<00:04:42.640> even<00:04:42.670> and<00:04:43.180> it<00:04:43.300> was<00:04:43.420> just<00:04:43.570> it<00:04:43.750> was

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
up not even and it was just it was

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.260 
up not even and it was just it was
insane<00:04:44.260> nobody<00:04:45.130> knew<00:04:45.250> was<00:04:45.370> going<00:04:45.490> to<00:04:45.580> work<00:04:45.730> but

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
insane nobody knew was going to work but

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.580 
insane nobody knew was going to work but
the<00:04:46.420> only<00:04:46.540> problem<00:04:46.810> I<00:04:46.930> had<00:04:47.110> with<00:04:47.200> that<00:04:47.380> is<00:04:47.560> that

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
the only problem I had with that is that

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.200 
the only problem I had with that is that
they<00:04:47.890> asked<00:04:48.310> one<00:04:48.580> of<00:04:48.610> the<00:04:48.700> substitute

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
they asked one of the substitute

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
they asked one of the substitute
teachers<00:04:49.570> that<00:04:49.690> we<00:04:49.840> had<00:04:50.020> and<00:04:50.230> he<00:04:51.220> is<00:04:51.490> like<00:04:52.240> he

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
teachers that we had and he is like he

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:54.510 
teachers that we had and he is like he
deals<00:04:53.500> with<00:04:53.680> that<00:04:53.800> kind<00:04:53.980> of<00:04:54.010> stuff<00:04:54.190> like<00:04:54.340> he

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
deals with that kind of stuff like he

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.220 
deals with that kind of stuff like he
can<00:04:54.700> teach<00:04:54.880> us<00:04:54.910> about<00:04:55.150> like<00:04:55.390> water<00:04:55.630> treatment

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
can teach us about like water treatment

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.190 
can teach us about like water treatment
and<00:04:56.560> like<00:04:56.740> all<00:04:56.980> all<00:04:57.610> the<00:04:58.030> key<00:04:58.540> elements<00:04:59.140> that

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
and like all all the key elements that

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.110 
and like all all the key elements that
had<00:04:59.800> to<00:04:59.950> do<00:05:00.070> with<00:05:00.100> making<00:05:00.400> the<00:05:00.580> water<00:05:00.790> got<00:05:01.000> it

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
had to do with making the water got it

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.940 
had to do with making the water got it
so<00:05:01.330> he<00:05:01.630> gave<00:05:01.780> me<00:05:01.990> a<00:05:02.020> day<00:05:02.230> they're<00:05:02.440> like<00:05:02.560> hey<00:05:02.680> you

should<00:05:02.980> probably<00:05:03.370> put<00:05:03.490> an<00:05:03.550> expansion<00:05:03.970> thank

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
should probably put an expansion thank

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.730 
should probably put an expansion thank
God<00:05:04.270> nobody<00:05:04.510> else<00:05:04.780> to<00:05:04.840> think<00:05:04.900> of<00:05:05.050> that<00:05:05.230> and
