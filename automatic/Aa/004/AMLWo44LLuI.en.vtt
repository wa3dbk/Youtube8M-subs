there's<00:00:07.779> audio<00:00:08.019> automation<00:00:08.830> in<00:00:09.040> Final<00:00:09.640> Cut

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:09.760 
there's audio automation in Final Cut

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.650 
there's audio automation in Final Cut
Pro<00:00:09.820> X<00:00:10.380> so<00:00:11.380> let's<00:00:11.560> just<00:00:11.740> get<00:00:11.830> right<00:00:12.010> to<00:00:12.070> it<00:00:12.660> so

hover over the audio bar you get this

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.020 
hover over the audio bar you get this
little<00:00:20.170> plus<00:00:20.410> sign<00:00:20.620> now<00:00:21.370> let's<00:00:21.550> take<00:00:21.820> down

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:22.030 
little plus sign now let's take down

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.620 
little plus sign now let's take down
this<00:00:22.180> little<00:00:22.450> audio<00:00:22.720> waveform<00:00:23.140> take<00:00:24.100> it<00:00:24.220> down

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
this little audio waveform take it down

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.740 
this little audio waveform take it down
put<00:00:25.630> four<00:00:26.020> nodes<00:00:26.350> and<00:00:27.150> drop<00:00:28.150> the<00:00:28.330> middle<00:00:28.570> and

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750 
put four nodes and drop the middle and

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.590 
put four nodes and drop the middle and
look<00:00:29.410> at<00:00:29.560> that<00:00:29.710> waveform<00:00:29.920> go<00:00:30.340> down<00:00:30.520> look<00:00:31.510> at

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:31.600 
look at that waveform go down look at

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.770 
look at that waveform go down look at
that<00:00:31.660> that's<00:00:32.469> beautiful<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:34.390> that's<00:00:34.600> the

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780

quick version of how to automate in
Final<00:00:37.179> Cut<00:00:37.239> Pro<00:00:37.359> X<00:00:37.920> now<00:00:38.920> for<00:00:39.129> those<00:00:39.190> of<00:00:39.249> you<00:00:39.489> who

want to watch the full video continue to
watch<00:00:41.909> right<00:00:42.909> so<00:00:43.210> this<00:00:44.109> is<00:00:44.289> not<00:00:44.469> quite

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:44.949 
watch right so this is not quite

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:47.219

practical let me show you this video and

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:49.250 
practical let me show you this video and
I'll<00:00:47.319> show<00:00:47.350> you<00:00:47.559> what<00:00:47.679> I<00:00:47.710> mean

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
I'll show you what I mean

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.239 
I'll show you what I mean
so<00:00:50.260> sometimes<00:00:50.710> when<00:00:50.829> you're<00:00:50.979> shooting<00:00:51.069> a

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:51.249 
so sometimes when you're shooting a

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:55.219 
so sometimes when you're shooting a
video<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:52.600> can<00:00:52.629> have<00:00:52.929> really<00:00:53.530> loud<00:00:53.889> actors<00:00:54.549> or

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:55.229 
video you can have really loud actors or

00:00:55.229 --> 00:01:00.750 
video you can have really loud actors or
really<00:00:56.229> quiet<00:00:56.499> lines<00:00:58.289> okay<00:00:59.489> so<00:01:00.489> now<00:01:00.609> you've

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
really quiet lines okay so now you've

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.829 
really quiet lines okay so now you've
seen<00:01:00.940> that<00:01:00.969> little<00:01:01.179> video<00:01:01.389> it's<00:01:01.629> true

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:01.839 
seen that little video it's true

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:03.660 
seen that little video it's true
sometimes<00:01:02.589> people<00:01:03.100> can't<00:01:03.280> control<00:01:03.399> the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
sometimes people can't control the

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.550 
sometimes people can't control the
levels<00:01:04.479> of<00:01:04.570> their<00:01:04.689> voices<00:01:04.869> or<00:01:05.229> some<00:01:05.409> people

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
levels of their voices or some people

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.350 
levels of their voices or some people
talks<00:01:05.890> off<00:01:06.100> more<00:01:06.369> softly<00:01:06.729> or<00:01:06.939> more<00:01:07.149> loudly

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
talks off more softly or more loudly

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.200 
talks off more softly or more loudly
than<00:01:07.689> others<00:01:07.930> so<00:01:08.860> this<00:01:09.369> is<00:01:09.490> what<00:01:09.610> we<00:01:09.729> can<00:01:09.850> do<00:01:10.000> a

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
than others so this is what we can do a

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.029 
than others so this is what we can do a
better<00:01:10.780> way<00:01:10.930> to<00:01:10.990> automate<00:01:11.409> is<00:01:11.590> to<00:01:11.799> right-click

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:12.039 
better way to automate is to right-click

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:14.850 
better way to automate is to right-click
or<00:01:12.610> secondary<00:01:13.210> clip<00:01:13.450> and<00:01:13.600> you<00:01:13.899> expand<00:01:14.469> audio

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
or secondary clip and you expand audio

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.730 
or secondary clip and you expand audio
components<00:01:15.340> now<00:01:16.270> when<00:01:16.420> you<00:01:16.509> do<00:01:16.719> this<00:01:16.869> it<00:01:17.140> drops

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
components now when you do this it drops

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.050 
components now when you do this it drops
down<00:01:17.890> this<00:01:18.130> little<00:01:18.280> menu<00:01:18.549> which<00:01:18.670> is<00:01:18.789> pretty

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
down this little menu which is pretty

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.310 
down this little menu which is pretty
much<00:01:19.149> exactly<00:01:19.329> the<00:01:19.630> same<00:01:19.719> as<00:01:19.990> what<00:01:20.109> we<00:01:20.170> had

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
much exactly the same as what we had

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.429 
much exactly the same as what we had
before<00:01:20.350> but<00:01:21.310> now<00:01:21.490> if<00:01:21.579> you<00:01:21.640> do<00:01:21.820> this

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
before but now if you do this

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.160 
before but now if you do this
bam<00:01:23.439> bam

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
bam bam

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.250 
bam bam
BAM<00:01:26.130> we<00:01:26.909> take<00:01:27.120> it<00:01:27.240> down<00:01:27.330> okay<00:01:27.720> everything<00:01:28.170> is

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
BAM we take it down okay everything is

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.860 
BAM we take it down okay everything is
the<00:01:28.409> same<00:01:28.440> as<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.890> was<00:01:29.010> before<00:01:29.220> but<00:01:29.729> now<00:01:30.630> check

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:30.870 
the same as it was before but now check

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.710 
the same as it was before but now check
it<00:01:30.990> out<00:01:31.190> collapse<00:01:32.190> audio<00:01:32.550> components<00:01:33.090> look

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
it out collapse audio components look

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.990 
it out collapse audio components look
the<00:01:34.350> automation<00:01:34.770> went<00:01:35.070> away<00:01:35.159> but<00:01:35.820> the

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
the automation went away but the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.899 
the automation went away but the
waveform<00:01:36.750> is<00:01:36.990> still<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.440> right<00:01:37.680> size<00:01:38.070> now<00:01:38.880> we

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
waveform is still the right size now we

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.840 
waveform is still the right size now we
can<00:01:39.330> use<00:01:39.360> this<00:01:39.780> as<00:01:40.080> a<00:01:40.530> master<00:01:40.920> volume<00:01:41.400> and

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
can use this as a master volume and

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.280 
can use this as a master volume and
increase<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.300> volume<00:01:42.420> as<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.750> whole<00:01:43.080> after

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
increase the volume as a whole after

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.380 
increase the volume as a whole after
we've<00:01:43.890> automated<00:01:44.369> out<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.850> highs<00:01:45.060> and

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
we've automated out the highs and

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.649 
we've automated out the highs and
automated<00:01:46.170> out<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.470> lows

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
automated out the lows

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.730 
automated out the lows
so<00:01:48.659> that's<00:01:48.840> pretty<00:01:49.020> much<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.350> for<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:49.590> video

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
so that's pretty much it for this video

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.830 
so that's pretty much it for this video
and<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.729> hope<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.210> really<00:01:51.360> helps<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.690> guys

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
and I hope this really helps you guys

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.170
