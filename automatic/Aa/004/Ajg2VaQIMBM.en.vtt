00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
been used fairly a lot so it's still the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.660 
been used fairly a lot so it's still the
ever<00:01:05.519> fresh<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.390> has<00:01:07.189> they<00:01:08.189> still<00:01:08.460> probably

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
ever fresh it has they still probably

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.820 
ever fresh it has they still probably
stink<00:01:10.670> anyway<00:01:11.810> yeah<00:01:12.810> look<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.590> part

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
stink anyway yeah look this is the part

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.580 
stink anyway yeah look this is the part
that<00:01:13.979> matters<00:01:14.189> really<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.380> surface

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
that matters really is the the surface

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.590 
that matters really is the the surface
that<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.250> contacts<00:01:17.700> with<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.119> as<00:01:18.270> long<00:01:18.450> as

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
that it contacts with and as long as

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.170 
that it contacts with and as long as
your<00:01:18.720> hand<00:01:19.070> goes<00:01:20.070> in<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.400> glove<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.880> it's<00:01:21.000> all

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
your hand goes in the glove and it's all

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.179 
your hand goes in the glove and it's all
attached<00:01:21.600> which<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:23.360> I<00:01:24.860> use<00:01:25.860> them<00:01:26.159> for

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
attached which it is I use them for

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.370 
attached which it is I use them for
holding<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.150> for<00:01:27.360> people<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.810> people<00:01:28.080> use<00:01:28.200> it

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
holding it for people and people use it

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.670 
holding it for people and people use it
for<00:01:28.560> me<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.869> yeah<00:01:30.869> no<00:01:31.110> one<00:01:31.259> has<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.439> problem

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
for me and yeah no one has a problem

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.210 
for me and yeah no one has a problem
with<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.130> they're<00:01:33.030> not<00:01:33.210> mantis<00:01:33.750> ones<00:01:34.020> but<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:35.189> I

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
with it they're not mantis ones but so I

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.219 
with it they're not mantis ones but so I
guess<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.610> mantis<00:01:35.939> ones<00:01:36.150> would<00:01:36.299> protect<00:01:37.079> your

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
guess the mantis ones would protect your

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.630 
guess the mantis ones would protect your
wrists<00:01:37.530> maybe<00:01:37.710> more<00:01:37.979> but<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.369> don't<00:01:38.520> have<00:01:38.579> a

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
wrists maybe more but I don't have a

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.350 
wrists maybe more but I don't have a
problem<00:01:39.060> with<00:01:39.210> my<00:01:39.390> risk<00:01:39.659> getting<00:01:40.409> hurt<00:01:40.530> anyway

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
problem with my risk getting hurt anyway

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.600 
problem with my risk getting hurt anyway
someone's<00:01:42.360> punching<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.869> hard<00:01:43.170> it's<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.490> think

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
someone's punching it hard it's I think

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.850 
someone's punching it hard it's I think
it's<00:01:44.909> really<00:01:45.149> good<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.840> don't<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.439> feel<00:01:46.710> it

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
it's really good you don't you feel it

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.380 
it's really good you don't you feel it
obviously<00:01:47.189> in<00:01:47.340> your<00:01:47.490> shoulders<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.180> stuff

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
obviously in your shoulders and stuff

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.010 
obviously in your shoulders and stuff
but<00:01:48.540> that's<00:01:48.720> with<00:01:48.840> any<00:01:48.990> mitts<00:01:49.320> probably<00:01:51.020> so

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
but that's with any mitts probably so

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.359 
but that's with any mitts probably so
the<00:01:52.140> only<00:01:52.259> problem<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.710> had<00:01:52.860> with<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.100> was<00:01:53.340> a
