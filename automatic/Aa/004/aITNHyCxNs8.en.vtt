just<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.170> normal<00:00:22.350> dude<00:00:22.619> with<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.859> mole<00:00:23.070> right

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
just a normal dude with a mole right

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.439 
just a normal dude with a mole right
here<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.460> don't<00:00:23.609> know<00:00:23.699> if<00:00:23.760> he's<00:00:23.880> embarrassed<00:00:24.330> of

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
here I don't know if he's embarrassed of

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.570 
here I don't know if he's embarrassed of
the<00:00:24.600> mole<00:00:24.840> or<00:00:25.230> what<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.769> case<00:00:25.949> may<00:00:26.160> be<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.369> I

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
the mole or what the case may be and I

the mole or what the case may be and I
think<00:00:26.609> this<00:00:26.880> was<00:00:27.060> kishimoto<00:00:27.539> since<00:00:27.779> he<00:00:27.900> knew

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
think this was kishimoto since he knew

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.990 
think this was kishimoto since he knew
people<00:00:28.680> been<00:00:28.830> wanting<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.550> see<00:00:29.699> this<00:00:29.789> for<00:00:29.939> a

it's a mole huh honestly if that was the

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.870 
it's a mole huh honestly if that was the
case<00:01:19.470> he<00:01:19.830> shoulda<00:01:20.100> just<00:01:20.220> kept<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.520> mask<00:01:20.729> on

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
case he shoulda just kept the mask on

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.490 
case he shoulda just kept the mask on
like<00:01:21.060> if<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.180> was<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.750> case<00:01:21.780> said<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.320> just

like if that was the case said is just
like<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.619> mole<00:01:22.950> something<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.580> again<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.790> don't
