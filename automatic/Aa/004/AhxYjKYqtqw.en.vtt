00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.460
 the training was mainly 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.140
 Even Fred Rutten had yet to relax 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.240
 time for a subtle one 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.830
 ball treatment that is all possible in the 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.880
 run up to the cup match with sv 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.940
 spakenburg 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.609
 in which two things are important 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.480
 you have to win and if they do then too 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.180
 nature could 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.680
 is very nice that we thought he was 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.480
 something from 20 box people 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.090
 that is of course great and you have 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.609
 club excellent from to yes more than 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.590
 26,000 were the last messages so that 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.070
 Also means that you get to customers inside 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:39.960
 can do yes yes they looked i mean it is 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.100
 a game that also needs entertainment 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.040
 commandments 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.350
 and yes to me then we can do that tomorrow 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.239
 the brother is missing it anyway 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.250
 the suspended push year as vukovic and 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.110
 jonathan travel the red card for the 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.660
 striker and the subsequent suspension of 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.180
 two duels against spakenburg and excelsior 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.190
 were reluctantly by the club 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.440
 accepted and the trainer can 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.350
 find in it 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.780
 I look at the connect completely 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.390
 with the words of from our manager and 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.970
 we have that holds a consultation 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.440
 they did it that way and this is think 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.090
 I already a little bit 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.240
 and so you can be able to play other minutes 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.939
 let rhythm gain well I say well I 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.380
 have in the past and also you can 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.350
 start of this season have said that 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.200
 we made our dressing room so a fairly high 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.799
 levels and now it is surrounding 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.090
 differ not so much the one time 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.579
 being big 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:40.350
 Last Sunday it turned out that 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:42.390
 something else with it and bake all that 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.100
 we just think that sometimes other 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.719
 Filling in footballs way is not 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.149
 very large amount in 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:49.799
 in quality of players but also with 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.450
 other names in the team 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.189
 It may not be a problem to find a place 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.170
 in the next round of 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.610
 the NFL cup tournament against one 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.799
 opponent who is a top of it 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.159
 amateur football plays and true fred 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.530
 rutten 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.659
 quite a few people i know my 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.129
 keeping a party settled in is green 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.989
 has always been a very large lens and 

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:07.799
 also their 

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:09.299
 is completely in professional football 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.430
 background still runs a few but that 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:13.379
 my table floor so you know 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.340
 they what they what what what tomorrow can go here 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.920
 to happen 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.790
 no underestimate, but surprise 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.790
 is excluded 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.569
 install there were surprises 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.519
 you are and in the present too 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.430
 always be surprises and make 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.380
 like to treat rather than call well 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:35.510
 and so there is only one thing to do 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.510
 score and entertain the public
