important to us and and we continue to
develop<00:02:29.530> new<00:02:30.530> technologies<00:02:31.160> in<00:02:31.280> the<00:02:31.310> safety

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
develop new technologies in the safety

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.850 
develop new technologies in the safety
arena<00:02:32.120> and<00:02:32.330> we<00:02:32.810> intend<00:02:33.110> to<00:02:33.230> be<00:02:33.319> a<00:02:33.350> leader<00:02:33.590> going

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
could possibly possibly want sure we've

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.670 
could possibly possibly want sure we've
integrated<00:03:41.150> a<00:03:41.510> lot<00:03:41.660> of<00:03:41.780> safety<00:03:42.110> technologies

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
integrated a lot of safety technologies

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.080 
integrated a lot of safety technologies
we<00:03:42.830> just<00:03:43.010> talked<00:03:43.220> about<00:03:43.340> things<00:03:43.520> like<00:03:43.850> lane

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
we just talked about things like lane

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.060 
we just talked about things like lane
