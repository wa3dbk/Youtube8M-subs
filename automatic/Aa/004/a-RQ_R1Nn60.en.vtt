 Perugia and Terni because yesterday was a bad day as far as

 via the griffin a team still 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.040
 incomplete but which has held up well against the Gianni fimati for us 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.120
 following 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.290
 the match at the conero was luca martelli

 eliminated the first plant newspaper 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.030
 and in any case it was a weak time for those of the griffins that they didn't have yet 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.300

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.170
 coming from the frosinone 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.320
 moreover, even high raids with advances recovered in extremis the defense 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.350
 paid duty at the first lunge so the soccer team built the success 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.119
 hundred of his attackers 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.240
 $ 19 the last championship of

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.960
 little pungent 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.610
 i 4 4 2 ticked anyway the comparison with a team of b il well 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.300
 perugia shown a little ruined especially in the difficulties when 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.240

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.810
 Marche's grip the pay team also tried to question it 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.289
 the qualification of the hosts is therefore important for the first half 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.020
 first contacts a minute later but once again decisive benassi which avoids 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.410
 the worst on the conclusion of the usual d faito to the official debut with his
