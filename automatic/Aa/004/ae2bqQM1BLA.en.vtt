that back i bought Oracle's and blue and
red<00:01:46.510> pot<00:01:46.810> so<00:01:47.820> making<00:01:48.820> a<00:01:49.000> bit<00:01:49.120> stronger<00:01:49.420> my<00:01:49.810> next

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
red pot so making a bit stronger my next

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
fight and I accept the game done pretty

00:01:52.510 --> 00:02:00.600 
fight and I accept the game done pretty
soon<00:01:52.600> so<00:01:52.990> that's<00:01:53.140> why<00:01:53.260> I<00:01:53.290> bought<00:01:53.440> elixirs<00:01:59.610> yep

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
soon so that's why I bought elixirs yep

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.950 
soon so that's why I bought elixirs yep
so<00:02:00.850> we<00:02:01.030> could<00:02:01.150> just<00:02:01.180> literally<00:02:01.480> push<00:02:01.780> it

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
so we could just literally push it

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.960 
so we could just literally push it
inside<00:02:02.230> the<00:02:02.500> game<00:02:02.680> so<00:02:03.400> we<00:02:03.490> going<00:02:03.640> to<00:02:03.700> take<00:02:03.820> top

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
inside the game so we going to take top

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.960 
inside the game so we going to take top
tower<00:02:04.980> you<00:02:05.980> can't<00:02:06.160> really<00:02:06.250> do<00:02:06.430> too<00:02:06.580> much<00:02:06.700> about

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
tower you can't really do too much about

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.000 
tower you can't really do too much about
it<00:02:09.269> so<00:02:10.269> we<00:02:10.390> actually<00:02:10.509> pick<00:02:10.780> up<00:02:10.899> Shen<00:02:11.230> somehow<00:02:11.709> I

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
it so we actually pick up Shen somehow I

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.380 
it so we actually pick up Shen somehow I
have<00:02:12.730> no<00:02:12.910> idea<00:02:13.000> how<00:02:13.209> that<00:02:13.239> happened<00:02:13.360> um<00:02:15.390> yeah
