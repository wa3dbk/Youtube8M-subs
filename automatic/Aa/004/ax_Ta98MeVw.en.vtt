I'll know exactly how far I wind I find

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.450 
I'll know exactly how far I wind I find
the<00:01:45.200> software<00:01:45.560> very<00:01:45.740> very<00:01:46.010> useful

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
the software very very useful

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.940 
the software very very useful
Ulysses<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:47.360> speedometer<00:01:47.900> just<00:01:48.650> creates<00:01:48.890> a

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
Ulysses the speedometer just creates a

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.380 
Ulysses the speedometer just creates a
new<00:01:49.040> trip<00:01:49.630> and<00:01:51.850> we'll<00:01:52.850> just<00:01:53.030> go<00:01:53.150> from<00:01:53.300> there

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
new trip and we'll just go from there

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.080 
new trip and we'll just go from there
uses<00:01:53.780> GPS<00:01:54.170> so<00:01:54.650> I'm<00:01:55.490> gonna<00:01:55.670> write<00:01:55.790> it<00:01:55.820> for<00:01:55.970> about

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
uses GPS so I'm gonna write it for about

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.580 
uses GPS so I'm gonna write it for about
20<00:01:56.390> miles<00:01:56.540> that's<00:01:56.810> why<00:01:56.870> my<00:01:56.990> plane<00:01:57.230> is<00:01:57.380> it's<00:01:57.560> a

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
20 miles that's why my plane is it's a

00:01:57.590 --> 00:03:33.990 
20 miles that's why my plane is it's a
little<00:01:57.800> cold<00:01:58.040> so<00:01:58.490> I<00:01:58.520> want<00:01:58.760> to<00:01:58.820> go<00:01:58.940> too<00:01:59.630> far<00:01:59.920> and

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.699 

okay<00:03:35.000> so<00:03:35.090> I'm<00:03:35.299> back<00:03:35.360> to<00:03:35.569> the<00:03:35.840> gas<00:03:36.049> station<00:03:36.079> same

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
okay so I'm back to the gas station same

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.899 
okay so I'm back to the gas station same
when<00:03:36.860> I<00:03:36.890> started<00:03:37.250> this<00:03:37.340> morning<00:03:39.069> as<00:03:40.069> the<00:03:40.400> mpg

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:40.909 
when I started this morning as the mpg

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:45.940 
when I started this morning as the mpg
on<00:03:41.030> his<00:03:41.209> bike<00:03:42.189> so<00:03:43.189> we<00:03:43.340> have<00:03:44.560> exactly<00:03:45.560> twenty

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
on his bike so we have exactly twenty

00:03:45.950 --> 00:04:04.729 
on his bike so we have exactly twenty
three<00:03:46.159> point<00:03:46.430> three<00:03:46.519> miles

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.949 

point<00:04:05.739> five<00:04:06.040> six<00:04:06.640> eight<00:04:06.939> I<00:04:06.969> think<00:04:07.120> it<00:04:07.390> was<00:04:07.480> 0.5

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
point five six eight I think it was 0.5

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:19.690 
point five six eight I think it was 0.5
gallons<00:04:10.170> so

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.380 

but<00:04:20.300> I<00:04:20.330> have<00:04:20.480> twenty<00:04:20.870> three<00:04:21.140> point<00:04:21.500> three

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
but I have twenty three point three

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.730 
but I have twenty three point three
divided<00:04:23.390> by<00:04:23.420> zero<00:04:23.930> point<00:04:26.080> five<00:04:27.080> because<00:04:27.530> I

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
divided by zero point five because I

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.580 
divided by zero point five because I
spilled<00:04:28.100> a<00:04:28.160> little<00:04:28.460> bit<00:04:28.990> the<00:04:29.990> bike<00:04:30.200> is<00:04:30.470> like

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
spilled a little bit the bike is like

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:36.100 
spilled a little bit the bike is like
forty<00:04:31.070> six<00:04:31.370> miles<00:04:31.760> a<00:04:31.910> gallon<00:04:31.990> on<00:04:32.990> the<00:04:33.770> street
