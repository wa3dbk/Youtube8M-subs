00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.890
 and stressed us jorge estrada we are going 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.430
 to talk today about a 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:18.500
 fashion that has never happened during all 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.900
 these times that are jeans and 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.939
 jeans and so on 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.550
 It is very important to know what the 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.490
 that those that remain for us because 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.040
 then we use ones that really 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:34.070
 ascend very badly or maybe if we have 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.739
 the hips quite wide makes us how 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.210
 make it even more obvious not for that 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.539
 it's easy you should already with us because 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.879
 welcome thank you very much to the box 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:46.190
 let's talk about the 15 effectively 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.440
 I tell you that it is a garment that 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.320
 less we always have to have 37 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.179
 wardrobe is the joker and today 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.340
 It is the most important plant that we have 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:57.620
 all then it is very common but it is 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.780
 something very difficult if we can see the 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.489
 trends please there are a thousand 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.260
 jeans trends every season 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.390
 they change changed the color they change the 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.970
 cuts changes the whole joke for 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.560
 find the best jeans is that you 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.350
 adjust the right place 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.970
 that you can move and that you do not fit and 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.520
 that does not make you leave the 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.729
 length is like a stretch and up and 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.460
 squeeze do not look very well let's go 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.170
 to start first with those that are low 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.080
 of stature with which they are very women 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.570
 appetite is these women have to 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.090
 look for classic cuts and waist 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.579
 mean what you should not use are 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.799
 very wide legs although a little 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.549
 bell can help you stylize the 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.170
 Figure in general we suggest is that 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.450
 be a bit long so that when you 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.340
 you can connect them with 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.399
 highest you have and that cover the 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.319
 heel ok when it is necessary to cut it 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.880
 I recommend that you wash them first to 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:55.709
 that after the goods to the tailor because 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.640
 because all the garments shrink by 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:02:00.659
 at least 3% that's an excellent one and that 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.459
 yes, we 're seeing right now in 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.200
 screen is an example for the low ones 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:06.539
 stature that are petits now is a 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.670
 Very straight cut is a classic cut in 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.470
 which you will not miss and have a 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.269
 little bit of bell that takes them 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.390
 helps to stylize the figure but also 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:16.620
 the petit they are very thin and also 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.599
 there are petit that are 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.519
 with extra gorditas you have to 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.860
 use different types of easy 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.930
 win the children later on I'm going to 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.150
 speak very well very well those that follows 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.430
 They are for those with curves cause 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.470
 wide hips not a little more full 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.720
 the best ones that we are seeing in 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.180
 screen this these models are stretch 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.370
 and straight cut and they also have a 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.980
 little bell is necessary that you 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.290
 stay comfortable along the legs 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.209
 and that they fit the bubbles so 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.349
 usually after this you're going to 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.120
 left over at the waist then 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.489
 We recommend that you always take them to a 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.440
 tailor to which you chin your waist 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.940
 here if there is no hate said that always 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.980
 we usually see the type cut 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.599
 of bell and the shape of the button in what 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.489
 that is but the bags is one thing that 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.739
 it anguishes me a lot to know if you have 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.659
 much pomp as 2000 as disguise of 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.400
 some way with the bag or if you have 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:07.409
 little there are strategies so that the 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.849
 bag is made as you stand and not 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:10.739
 including portfolio positions 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.269
 small bubbles, we recommend you 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.950
 use bags that have a volume 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:17.370
 charge type or have buttons 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.319
 striking or that are small because 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.620
 because being small the bag of 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.620
 jeans 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.650
 also for those who have curves 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.530
 We recommend the dark colors because 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.260
 lose weight and the kings with more colors 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.660
 dark in the leg or up and go 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.330
 degrading the dark down also 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.190
 help to stylize the clear figure that 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.050
 the figure even with the colors 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.120
 venturing now in a lot the 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.740
 not washed away and poetry just with 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.970
 someone at the bar with the project is also 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:51.280
 very dangerous because you can this 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.260
 create for example the tones that are 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.970
 the washes create light this creates more 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.010
 volume in certain ways that can be 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.990
 not play in your favor must be very 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.660
 care for people who have a lot 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.550
 pomp this the reform mind what 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.570
 we said a dark color and they are 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:09.250
 uniforms that do not have guaje 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.290
 we recommend what you should not 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.790
 be alone skinny jeans because imagine 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.170
 that have a lot of pomp and then the tube 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.170
 you're going to look a little ridiculous 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.780
 in the fashion now I do not piped it and that 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:29.530
 they are like clean and others but it is not for 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:32.170
 the famous ones are the fashion ones what you 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.910
 accommodates the back when it is like this is a 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.740
 model later on we'll talk to 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.260
 those that are very thin do not have this 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.810
 body things and a little flat you 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.850
 we recommend low waist straight cut and 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.100
 that are adjusted here yes here yes they 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.740
 I recommend using the 100 this tube or what 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.390
 they make this is for you perfect you 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.040
 we recommend lowering the lights you're going 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.169
 to help use the figure and you 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.900
 you can put your turn to say ok well 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:57.610
 the belts 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.310
 and the next model that we're going to see is 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.750
 for those who have the short torso aitor 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.550
 your short you have to look for waists 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.650
 low not because you have to extend this 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.900
 middle part of the body and you should not 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.670
 use high waist and have 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.380
 many details at the top there are 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.840
 some that have ornaments and all this 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.810
 get away from them we recommend you use 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.360
 short jackets or just three shorts for 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.190
 see how the body is separated and 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.860
 see more waist but also by 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.270
 example long blouses that are 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.790
 recommend with chalk because that's how we do not see 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.800
 where is your suture really 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.750
 and well these are red and this is one of 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.880
 the hottest trends right now in jeans 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.830
 of color all the colors there are in 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.990
 all stores kids at least 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.760
 they must buy a few hey that perez 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.200
 of the exception pants much fashionable 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.760
 raise pomp with that strategy 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.290
 enjoy but there exist 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.030
 pants that have lycra that you 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.360
 help support back then if 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.360
 it serves 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.510
 well we recommend it also and 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.170
 we also recommend for work 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:58.170
 always dark jeans look better 

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.170
 okay 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:02.939
 interesting and who was going to imagine 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:04.889
 that since those years that 

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:07.139
 used the ies only to 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:10.289
 rough mining jobs for that were 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:11.879
 designed in 1872 more I'm not mistaken 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:13.589
 easy and now they were one of the 

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:15.059
 basic clothes that we all have to 

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:16.679
 we all have to have there is it 

00:06:15.059 --> 00:06:18.149
 many times I believe because I'm going to 

00:06:16.679 --> 00:06:20.789

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:23.069
