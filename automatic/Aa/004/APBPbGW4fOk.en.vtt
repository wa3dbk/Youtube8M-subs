00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 today we introduce a topic that for i 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.029
 tennis players is also essential for you 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.250
 that you want to approach the instrument and to 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.019
 consequently you die from the desire of 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.670
 dream right away learn this well 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.519
 concept here concerning the riots and 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.130
 the agreements without which we are ruined 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.980
 then the arrangements as they are there are 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.900
 a trick resulting from the agreement 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.420
 suppose we want to agree to 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.859
 we start from the note that gives the name is 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.230
 the agreement then in this case 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.240
 we will start from later 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:34.640
 then we count four keys ha 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:36.800
 so now to follow his father 12 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.129
 we play and we found the third one then 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.960
 we count 3 1 2 3 and we found the 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.620
 fifth here is our major agreement 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.449
 of do 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.860
 this rule applies to all notes 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:48.570
 stairs because they were piano 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.820
 consequently if we wanted to find 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.010
 the king greater agreement what to do 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:58.100
 let's start with the king who notes it asking me 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.100
 the agreement after which we count 12 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.259
 no one is leaving with this trick 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.690
 infallible if he was a 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:08.100
 read a score had no 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.270
 type of problem recognizes the fitting 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.330
 we're talking about 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.530
 and this is something else fundamental 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.880
 important when you got it 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.619
 familiar with these agreements and 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.600
 train yourself to find them reading me 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.330
 sheet music you must understand that the chords 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.039
 do not play in this position 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.020
 but according to the rules disharmonious and 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:27.570
 we just don't care right now 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.070
 we must use turned what 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.860
 They are directed agree 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.300
 in this case in fact involves the 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.240
 if how many notes are tommy hill 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.860
 cazzola 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.860
 but we could also make doc fittings 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.509
 I am in the money domain or playing just me 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.130
 to then close it 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.259
 now I have turned everyone upside down 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.080
 the revolts from the fundamental position 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.720
 of the agreement the note below 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.450
 without forgetting the other two the sea 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.130
 level a is transporting the octave above and 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.200
 this is the first one I turned to 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.119
 third same thing we will do in this case 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.880
 hence the lower note we raise 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.520
 from below holding the other two laughs and 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.560
 we carry the eighth above and we will have a 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.330
 another side facing back when 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.950
 we find ourselves as in this case then 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.750
 we have a rose below you are 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.310
 we carry it up there we are in 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.280
 same position we had the point of 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.019
 departure are injured turned to 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.200
 buttocks to find the faces of all 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.200
 agreements
