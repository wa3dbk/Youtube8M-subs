00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.719
 let's make a wonderful gift 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.619
 for our men origami shirt with 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.140
 tie for making this craft 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.779
 we will need a sheet of A4 paper and 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.769
 small leaf for a tie in the size 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.230
 8 and a half to 80 half centimeters 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:34.489
 we begin to fold a large sheet 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.489
 we fold our leaf in half 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.100
 unfold 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:51.100
 and now each side is lower and upper 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.100
 let's get to the center fold line 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.140
 the upper side too bend 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:18.720
 unfold the paper sheet and 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:21.860
 turn over bends this side 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.860
 to the center line we get 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.860
 triangle 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.229
 and this side is also central 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:48.450
 turn the paper upside down 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.580
 now this corner we need 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.310
 bend here to this point point 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.130
 intersections of length parallel lines and 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.100
 this one diagonal bend one 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.590
 corner and the second corner too bend to 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:09.360
 this intersection point vertically 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:11.370
 and this one is now diagonal lines now 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.750
 we have to make a fold over this 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.310
 here are the horizontal lines along 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.310
 triangles bend 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.860
 do the fold Alina our fold 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.200
 and collect 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.200
 two stripes 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.430
 look now along the bending lines we 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.480
 turn down the corners up the bottom too 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.480
 from type to them up 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.430
 we have such a figure 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.430
 look still 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:58.670
 turn over our billet and turn down 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:02.959
 a little fold in centimeters 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:05.630
 turned over the blanks again now we take 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:09.370
 ruler and centimeters 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.370
 put a dot on the middle 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:16.930
 it will be our landmark 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.930
 to this point we bend one little corner 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:32.090
 here and on one corner and the second little corner 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:35.300
 also see this point with us 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.410
 turned collar shirt is now under 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.340
 this collar 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:44.440
 we bend our second part lower 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.440
 part and do the fold 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.650
 turn over our shirt and make 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:58.460
 one more cuff so she can with us 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:04:02.090
 stand reveal handicraft 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:05.560
 and we work well on these folds one 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.560
 and second 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:18.510
 we made a stand for crafts now 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:21.030
 can't put on the table 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.980
 now we will make the tie beautiful 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.040
 ties are made from colored paper 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.050
 bright or paper with a picture but I tell you 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.420
 show on pink paper to be 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.160
 it is better 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:36.350
 turn our leaf over the bright side 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.350
 down and fold it diagonally 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:46.909
 unfold and bend 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:48.379
 one angle to our fold line is obtained 

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:51.199
 here is so long wrong 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:53.680
 a triangle and a second area, too, to 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:53.680
 note 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.590
 turn over our stock now 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.050
 tuck in a sharp corner here this one 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.860
 to this point it is. it turns out if 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:19.940
 draw a line like this. 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:24.410
 we bend and again sharply corner up still 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:27.050
 times of torture and on the floor centimeter bend 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.830
 up paper here we have a floor here 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.130
 centimeter 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:34.640
 paid we turn our 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:36.970
 the blank here is this side we need 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.590
 bend to the middle 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.570
 note that the top paper is not 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.310
 lets 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:46.070
 turns away corner and we just 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:49.250
 that's how it is laid in exactly the same way 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:51.770
 Here is an example of one little and another 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:54.970
 the sides just as well it me to the middle 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.970
 should bend over 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:03.510
 on top of the paper turns around a tick 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.510
 and we press it 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.569
 here's a look how these turned out 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:11.659
 triangles 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:15.080
 we have adjusted the paper to me we do ourselves 

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:16.689
 lay we sneaked we got 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.580
 call 

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:22.299
 tie is inserted collar way 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:24.610
 shirts can there it is our foothold 

00:06:22.299 --> 00:06:26.649
 hack ready she's well worth on 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.989
 stand now I will tell you one 

00:06:26.649 --> 00:06:33.269
 the secret of this work can be 

00:06:28.989 --> 00:06:33.269
 wonderful gift envelope
