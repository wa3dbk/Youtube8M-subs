00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.049
 rapid brand watch out for 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.120
 have more than 80 years of experience and 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:12.860
 constant evolution have 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.779
 hydrostatic transmission what you 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.820
 allows to eliminate the gearbox 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:19.980
 the clutch to take advantage of 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.930
 maximum engine power 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.789
 the PTO is totally 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.650
 independent to the transmission and it 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.570
 can be coupled and uncoupled by a 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.160
 electric switch when the machine 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.160
 is standing or moving 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.440
 the advance speed is gradual when 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.059
 the machine moves forward or 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.399
 backwards thanks to a hilt 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.739
 swivel located on the right handle 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.539
 thus avoiding to disconnect the transmission 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.539
 change speed or brake 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.030
 the complement system for 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.420
 defense feels range of implements with 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.640
 the 50 fast easy fast and very safe 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.379
 with a single click we have the certainty of 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.309
 that will not simply give us the hundred 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.309
 one hundred percent of its capacity 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.990
 no doubt some graffiti with people 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.330
 comfortable is versatile quick of little 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.770
 easy and fast maintenance wear 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.750
 as well as low fuel consumption 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.909
 rapid has different models 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.649
 choose depending on what 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.490
 the producer 's needs and 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:30.649
 products for example the world model of 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.289
 the rapid brand is a mono axis with 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:35.750
 hydrostatic transmission of a rotation 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:38.959
 to the left of 900 revolutions per 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.319
 minute and a rate of 3300 revolutions 

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:43.250
 per minute has clutch 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:46.009
 electromagnetic a grip 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.530
 rotating in two parts back and forth 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:51.259
 for speed regulation the 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.209
 which can reach forward up 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.470
 6 kilometers per hour and back 

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:58.500
 up to 4 kilometers 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.320
 the PTO has a speed of 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.300
 900 rpm has 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.250
 a hydrostatic brake that is located 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.590
 in the rotating hilt and one 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.710
 mechanical on a brake lever in the 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.050
 left handle the differential is 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:16.590
 mechanically coupled has a weight of 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:19.350
 110 kilograms a maximum height of 1450 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.500

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.840
 millimeters and a maximum length of 1400 2 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:30.150
 millimeters 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:33.000
 its engine is a drop ghd 280 with a 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.430
 power of 9 horsepower and 6.6 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.910
 kilowats all this provided by a 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.220
 four- stroke cylinder 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.500
 the monkey axis euro of the rapid marks 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.450
 It has hydrostatic transmission with 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.120
 monkey dry disc clutch demand 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.310
 Hydraulic transmissions continuous and without 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.070
 cars the rotating handle in two 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.860
 parts back and forth regulate their 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:57.320
 speed that goes of 8 and 4 kilometers by 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.110
 hour respectively the speed of 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:03.020
 PTO is 2 positions one of 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.540
 630 revolutions per minute and the other of 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.160
 a thousand revolutions per minute counts on 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.160
 a hydrostatic brake on the handle 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.740
 rotating and other mechanical your differential 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:16.220
 It is mechanically coupled has a weight 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:19.370
 total without attachments of 255 kilograms 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.400
