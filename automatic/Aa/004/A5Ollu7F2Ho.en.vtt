liked<00:05:05.150> his<00:05:05.449> character<00:05:06.020> in<00:05:06.139> the<00:05:06.229> way<00:05:06.320> that<00:05:06.470> he

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
liked his character in the way that he

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.740 
liked his character in the way that he
acted<00:05:06.800> and<00:05:07.250> then<00:05:07.669> also<00:05:07.850> the<00:05:08.060> dying<00:05:08.300> girl<00:05:08.419> I

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
acted and then also the dying girl I

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.689 
acted and then also the dying girl I
feel<00:05:08.960> like<00:05:09.050> we<00:05:09.199> barely<00:05:09.500> got<00:05:09.919> to<00:05:10.190> brush<00:05:10.430> her

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:10.699 
feel like we barely got to brush her

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:12.100 
feel like we barely got to brush her
character<00:05:11.150> to<00:05:11.300> see<00:05:11.510> what<00:05:11.690> she<00:05:11.840> was<00:05:11.960> like

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
character to see what she was like

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.629 
character to see what she was like
because<00:05:12.410> Greg<00:05:12.770> doesn't<00:05:13.010> really<00:05:13.280> care<00:05:13.550> about

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 
because Greg doesn't really care about

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:15.640 
because Greg doesn't really care about
her<00:05:13.910> that's<00:05:14.870> the<00:05:15.020> other<00:05:15.139> thing<00:05:15.229> about<00:05:15.410> this
