00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
didn't miss that once okay so what we do

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:15.560 
didn't miss that once okay so what we do
is<00:00:56.190> we<00:00:56.460> get<00:00:56.610> rid<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:56.910> crap<00:01:07.610> new<00:01:08.610> parts<00:01:14.570> so

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
is we get rid of this crap new parts so

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.820 
is we get rid of this crap new parts so
they<00:01:15.630> had<00:01:15.810> these<00:01:15.930> spacers<00:01:18.320> are<00:01:19.320> all<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.650> same

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
they had these spacers are all the same

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.260 
they had these spacers are all the same
height<00:01:20.750> so<00:01:21.750> there's<00:01:21.930> no<00:01:22.020> adjustment<00:01:22.259> I

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
height so there's no adjustment I

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.130 
height so there's no adjustment I
thought<00:01:24.270> they<00:01:24.390> did<00:01:24.509> make<00:01:24.689> different<00:01:24.990> length

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
thought they did make different length

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.249 
thought they did make different length
ones<00:01:25.380> for<00:01:25.590> worn<00:01:25.740> plates<00:01:26.900> or<00:01:27.900> if<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.080> want<00:01:28.229> a

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
ones for worn plates or if you want a

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.710 
ones for worn plates or if you want a
more<00:01:28.380> spring<00:01:28.650> tension<00:01:29.240> but<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.360> did<00:01:30.479> them<00:01:30.659> at

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
more spring tension but it did them at

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.830 
more spring tension but it did them at
the<00:01:30.810> travel<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.380> it's<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.680> clutch<00:01:32.329> sometimes

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.960 

okay<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:36.900> those<00:01:37.140> go<00:01:37.320> off<00:01:37.470> in<00:01:37.619> there<00:01:39.170> this<00:01:40.170> now

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
okay so those go off in there this now

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.399 
okay so those go off in there this now
voila<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.630> correct<00:01:42.720> heights<00:01:43.170> when<00:01:43.350> you

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
voila is it the correct heights when you

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.120 
voila is it the correct heights when you
take<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.710> down<00:01:45.259> it<00:01:46.259> also<00:01:46.439> makes<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.829> stronger

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
take this down it also makes it stronger

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.550 
take this down it also makes it stronger
good<00:01:47.430> now<00:01:47.549> it's<00:01:47.670> all<00:01:47.790> tied<00:01:48.000> together<00:01:48.259> and<00:01:49.259> warp

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
good now it's all tied together and warp

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.350 
good now it's all tied together and warp
