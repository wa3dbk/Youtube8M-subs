eggs beat really well after the addition
of<00:00:31.230> each<00:00:31.439> egg<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.329> add<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.360> little<00:00:33.660> flour<00:00:36.829> sift

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
of each egg and add a little flour sift

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.799

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
the rest of the flour which again is 200

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.190 
the rest of the flour which again is 200
grams<00:00:40.430> with<00:00:41.430> 2<00:00:41.910> teaspoons<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.629> baking<00:00:42.840> powder

grams with 2 teaspoons of baking powder

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.740 
grams with 2 teaspoons of baking powder
and<00:00:45.110> fold<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.350> all<00:00:46.500> together<00:00:47.390> now<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.450> need<00:00:48.629> to

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
and fold it all together now you need to

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.170 
and fold it all together now you need to
just<00:00:48.899> butter<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.320> 20<00:00:49.829> centimeter<00:00:50.489> square<00:00:50.789> cake

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
just butter a 20 centimeter square cake

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.660 
just butter a 20 centimeter square cake
tin<00:00:51.480> so<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:52.649> quite<00:00:52.800> an<00:00:53.010> important<00:00:53.489> bit

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
tin so this is quite an important bit

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.360 
tin so this is quite an important bit
because<00:00:53.960> with<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.140> grease<00:00:55.320> proof<00:00:55.530> paper<00:00:55.590> that

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
because with the grease proof paper that

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.099 
because with the grease proof paper that
you<00:00:56.460> need<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.670> put<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:57.000> tin<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.809> need<00:00:57.989> to

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
you need to put in a tin you need to

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.549 
you need to put in a tin you need to
make<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.320> middle<00:00:58.980> sort<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.370> division<00:00:59.760> a<00:01:00.180> divider

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
make a middle sort of division a divider

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.170 
make a middle sort of division a divider
so<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.770> cake<00:01:02.010> mix<00:01:02.309> doesn't<00:01:02.940> spread

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
so that the cake mix doesn't spread

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.340 
so that the cake mix doesn't spread
together<00:01:03.539> we're<00:01:03.870> going<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.049> make<00:01:04.170> two

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
together we're going to make two

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.820 
together we're going to make two
different<00:01:04.470> colours<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:06.229> just<00:01:07.229> cut<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.650> piece

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
different colours so just cut the piece

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.580 
different colours so just cut the piece
of<00:01:08.040> Rhys<00:01:08.189> blue<00:01:08.369> paper<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:09.240> width<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.780> your<00:01:09.869> tin

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
of Rhys blue paper the width of your tin

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.160 
of Rhys blue paper the width of your tin
and<00:01:11.310> make<00:01:11.490> sure<00:01:11.700> it's<00:01:12.000> long<00:01:12.420> enough<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.960> hang

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
and make sure it's long enough to hang

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.730 
and make sure it's long enough to hang
over<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.470> sides<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.340> tin<00:01:14.869> like<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:16.200> and

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
over the sides of the tin like that and

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.789 
over the sides of the tin like that and
then<00:01:17.490> just<00:01:17.759> pull<00:01:18.030> up<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.299> middle<00:01:21.110> so<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.140> you

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
then just pull up the middle so that you

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.940 
then just pull up the middle so that you
have<00:01:23.270> this<00:01:24.270> done<00:01:24.810> centre<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.350> tin<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.710> keep

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
have this done centre of the tin to keep

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.920 
have this done centre of the tin to keep
the<00:01:26.040> cake<00:01:26.189> separate<00:01:26.670> then<00:01:27.450> butter<00:01:27.750> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
the cake separate then butter the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.399 
the cake separate then butter the
greaseproof<00:01:28.259> paper

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
greaseproof paper

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.469 
greaseproof paper
so<00:01:30.009> we've<00:01:30.100> got<00:01:30.280> the<00:01:30.430> yellow<00:01:30.759> part<00:01:31.030> of<00:01:31.180> the<00:01:31.240> cake

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
so we've got the yellow part of the cake

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.179 
so we've got the yellow part of the cake
so<00:01:31.719> half<00:01:32.020> of<00:01:32.259> this<00:01:32.530> can<00:01:32.860> go<00:01:32.890> into<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.640> tin<00:01:35.189> and

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
so half of this can go into the tin and

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:37.410 
so half of this can go into the tin and
then<00:01:36.490> we<00:01:36.579> just<00:01:36.729> need<00:01:36.820> to<00:01:37.030> make<00:01:37.149> the<00:01:37.240> other<00:01:37.360> half

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
then we just need to make the other half

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.139 
then we just need to make the other half
pink<00:01:37.960> so<00:01:38.710> we<00:01:38.890> can<00:01:39.070> do<00:01:39.220> that<00:01:39.369> by<00:01:39.549> just<00:01:39.579> adding<00:01:39.880> a

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
pink so we can do that by just adding a

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:49.720 
pink so we can do that by just adding a
little<00:01:40.180> pink<00:01:40.810> food<00:01:41.170> coloring

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.880 

then<00:01:50.300> spoon<00:01:50.630> this<00:01:50.840> pig<00:01:51.020> mixture<00:01:51.440> into<00:01:51.680> the

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
then spoon this pig mixture into the

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.500 
then spoon this pig mixture into the
other<00:01:52.100> side<00:01:52.400> of<00:01:52.580> the<00:01:52.670> tent

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.050 

bake<00:01:56.140> at<00:01:56.320> 180<00:01:56.830> degrees<00:01:57.250> centigrade<00:01:57.700> for<00:01:58.000> about

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
bake at 180 degrees centigrade for about

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.660 
bake at 180 degrees centigrade for about
25<00:01:58.870> to<00:01:59.020> 30<00:01:59.200> minutes<00:01:59.560> until<00:01:59.800> the<00:02:00.010> sponge<00:02:00.370> is

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
25 to 30 minutes until the sponge is

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.880 
25 to 30 minutes until the sponge is
cooked<00:02:00.940> leave<00:02:01.840> to<00:02:02.050> call<00:02:02.230> in<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.470> tin<00:02:02.650> for<00:02:02.830> a

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
cooked leave to call in the tin for a

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.200 
cooked leave to call in the tin for a
few<00:02:03.070> minutes<00:02:03.310> and<00:02:03.550> then<00:02:03.640> leave<00:02:03.820> to<00:02:03.850> cool<00:02:04.120> on<00:02:04.180> a

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
few minutes and then leave to cool on a

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.260 
few minutes and then leave to cool on a
cooling<00:02:04.300> rack<00:02:04.890> so<00:02:05.890> now<00:02:05.980> the<00:02:06.040> cake<00:02:06.310> score<00:02:06.700> I<00:02:06.940> can

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
cooling rack so now the cake score I can

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.240 
cooling rack so now the cake score I can
cut<00:02:07.420> it<00:02:07.600> put<00:02:08.140> one<00:02:08.350> sponge<00:02:08.649> on<00:02:08.860> top<00:02:08.890> of<00:02:09.160> the

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
cut it put one sponge on top of the

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.220 
cut it put one sponge on top of the
other<00:02:09.399> and<00:02:09.729> trim<00:02:10.210> the<00:02:10.330> edges<00:02:10.450> so<00:02:10.869> that<00:02:10.899> all<00:02:11.110> the

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
other and trim the edges so that all the
