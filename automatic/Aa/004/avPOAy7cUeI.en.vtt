oh I want to go for this map prologues

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.850 
oh I want to go for this map prologues
every<00:01:03.420> time<00:01:03.629> trailer<00:01:03.870> prologue<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> race<00:01:04.710> as

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
every time trailer prologue in a race as

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.780 
every time trailer prologue in a race as
an<00:01:04.979> opportunity<00:01:05.460> for<00:01:05.610> me<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.150> it's<00:01:07.250> the<00:01:08.250> time

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
an opportunity for me and it's the time

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.100 
an opportunity for me and it's the time
trials<00:01:09.150> towards<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.570> end<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.900> stage

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
trials towards the end of the stage

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.690 
trials towards the end of the stage
races<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.530> think<00:01:10.710> there's<00:01:10.890> sort<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.340> ways<00:01:11.520> of

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
races I think there's sort of ways of

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.130 
races I think there's sort of ways of
looking<00:01:11.820> at<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.090> where<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.600> could<00:01:12.900> back<00:01:13.110> off

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
looking at it where I could back off

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.440 
looking at it where I could back off
during<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.799> whole<00:01:13.920> stage<00:01:14.250> race<00:01:14.520> focus<00:01:15.180> on<00:01:15.299> it

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
during the whole stage race focus on it

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.380 
during the whole stage race focus on it
but<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.869> haven't<00:01:16.439> done<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.740> unless<00:01:16.979> the

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
but I haven't done that unless the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.880 
but I haven't done that unless the
directors<00:01:18.390> have<00:01:18.570> specifically<00:01:19.080> said<00:01:19.350> you

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
directors have specifically said you

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.160

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
know save yourself for eric's because I

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.289 
know save yourself for eric's because I
thoroughly<00:01:22.860> enjoy<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.400> lead<00:01:23.580> out<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:24.000> you

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
get such a buzz when you do a lot of

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.310 
get such a buzz when you do a lot of
work<00:01:26.670> for<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.939> teammate<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.600> then<00:01:27.720> he<00:01:27.900> gets<00:01:28.080> a

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
work for a teammate and then he gets a

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.560 
work for a teammate and then he gets a
good<00:01:28.710> result<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:31.070> I<00:01:32.070> always<00:01:32.520> go<00:01:32.700> into<00:01:32.880> tantra

good result so I I always go into tantra
I<00:01:33.600> don't<00:01:33.840> think<00:01:34.200> about<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.560> time<00:01:34.740> travel

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
I don't think about the time travel

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.160 
I don't think about the time travel
until<00:01:35.250> I've<00:01:35.400> done<00:01:35.640> with<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.689> stage<00:01:36.930> before

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
until I've done with the stage before

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.580 
until I've done with the stage before
and<00:01:37.880> and<00:01:38.880> then<00:01:39.360> obviously<00:01:39.600> hit<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.170> as<00:01:40.409> hard

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
and and then obviously hit that as hard

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.429 
and and then obviously hit that as hard
as<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.799> can<00:01:40.979> it's<00:01:41.280> nice<00:01:41.640> because<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.439> whereas

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
as I can it's nice because I whereas

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.520 
as I can it's nice because I whereas
some<00:01:43.649> riders<00:01:43.890> they<00:01:44.700> have<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.149> they<00:01:46.079> go<00:01:46.229> into<00:01:46.380> a

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
season it would just be a little bit

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.770 
season it would just be a little bit
later<00:04:02.220> than<00:04:02.730> planned<00:04:02.790> I<00:04:03.269> mean<00:04:03.480> I<00:04:03.600> wasn't

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
later than planned I mean I wasn't

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.900

wasn't<00:04:04.620> too<00:04:04.830> worried<00:04:05.190> about<00:04:05.250> it<00:04:05.430> to<00:04:05.640> start

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
wasn't too worried about it to start

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.090 
wasn't too worried about it to start
we've<00:04:06.090> had<00:04:06.390> the<00:04:06.600> first<00:04:06.959> week<00:04:07.260> off<00:04:07.500> and<00:04:07.830> a<00:04:07.950> lot

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
we've had the first week off and a lot

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.220 
we've had the first week off and a lot
of<00:04:08.130> the<00:04:08.280> riders<00:04:08.690> anyway<00:04:09.690> were<00:04:09.840> taking<00:04:10.170> a

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230
