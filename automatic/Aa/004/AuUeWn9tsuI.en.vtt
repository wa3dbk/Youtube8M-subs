00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.799
 Hello 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.840
 growers often ask themselves and what 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:12.349
 fertilize and feed coniferous 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.540
 plant 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.910
 generally speaking young conifers 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.560
 needs a dressing like adults 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.659
 formed rule huge 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.759
 formed by the root system 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:24.829
 feeding does not need 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:25.819
 but so no less consider this question 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:28.039
 in more detail 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:30.560
 the most ideal fertilizer for conifers 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.110
 plants of course is compost after all 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.420
 compost by and large imitates in 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.370
 this rich forest soil which 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.070
 is a natural habitat 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.600
 for many wars for what is right 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.740
 make compost need to do the following 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.990
 the operation needs to be loosened shallowly 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.750
 tree trunk around our conifer 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:56.580
 plants 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:01:00.220
 and now we pour compost neatly 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:02.850
 not a thick layer of centimeters 5 10 by 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.850
 wheel circle 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.830
 after the compost is scattered 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:28.310
 mix the whole thing a little 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:30.760
 that part of the compost has gone down here 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.420
 so the altitude create around 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.110
 coniferous plants 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.310
 good rich soil liquid 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.220
 organic fertilizer based 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.110
 vermicompost can also very well 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.170
 used as a fertilizer for 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.390
 conifers they are different 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.810
 Absolutely packings happen in granules 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.970
 there are liquid already dissolved anyway 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.600
 a small amount according to well 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.729
 instruction 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.070
 this fertilizer needs to be dissolved in water 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.430
 and scorching him with the stem of it 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.180
 plants can also be used 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.890
 complex mineral fertilizers 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.920
 which are also the most diverse 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.200
 types of a wide variety of film packages 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.910
 read the instructions carefully how to 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.410
 apply this fertilizer fertilizer for 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.180
 coniferous of your plants 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.970
 another important question is how often 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.980
 it is possible to fertilize a coniferous plant 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.370
 I recommend splitting a portion of fertilizer 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.060
 in two parts the first time you fertilize where 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.550
 then in april 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.290
 when active sap flow begins 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.260
 when buds are blooming 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.230
 second time somewhere in the early summer here 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.220
 later fertilize is not worth it anymore 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.700
 in the fact that in the nose fertilizer causes 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.520
 increased growth 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.420
 branches young shoots do not have time as 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.370
 should call 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.980
 and accordingly in the winter during strong 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.930
 frost but will not be damaged 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.880
 die so the last fertilizer 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.220
 better to produce somewhere in the early summer and 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.990
 again the most important rule 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.090
 read the instructions carefully 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.160
 fertilizer application 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.030
 complex mineral or based 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.700
 biohumus 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.430
 and be sure to read the rules 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.020
 care in some plant which 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.360
 you are actually going to fertilize 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.890
 Now there are many drugs that 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.959
 can be specifically used for 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.020
 improve the appearance of your conifer 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.790
 plants preparations that add 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.930
 vitamins not only through the root 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.459
 system but through his 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.219
 particular there is such a drug for 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.439
 prevent crown drilling often 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:28.540
 coniferous plant turn brown to 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:32.400
 this was not buy such a drug and 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:35.010
 quietly and spray do not enter 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:39.420
 Of course it's better not to do on a sunny day 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.420
 cloudy early in the morning or late in the evening 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.959
 Here is the actual implementation of these simple 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:53.319
 recommendations will allow you to support 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.120
 your pet good condition 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.349
 he will always have a beautiful crown 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.349
 my beauty
