 august attributes - help Your people to turn to Your manifold gifts and 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:50.980
 turn face to the Tabernacle of Thy wisdom. Heal you the sicknesses that on all sides

 Thou art glorified, O Lord my God! Thank You for allowing me to recognize the Manifestation 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:21.250
 of Thine own self and have separated me from Thy enemies; for being exposed before my 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:41.550
 eyes his evil deeds and evil deeds in Your days; for you have freed me from all connection 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:57.060
 to them and made me seek Your grace and Your abundant favors. I thank You, too, 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:23.250
 because thou hast made me come down upon me, from the clouds of Thy Will, which hath sanctified me 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:33.590
 the suggestions of infidels and the allusions of unbelievers, which I firmly set in you 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:42.790

 to exalt Your virtues, and to give me drink of the cup of Thy mercy,
