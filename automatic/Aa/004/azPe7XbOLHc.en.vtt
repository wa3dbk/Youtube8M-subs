see Fuji Chrome so that's replicating

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.600

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.480 
and Fuji chrome Velvia 100 Kodachrome 64
and<00:01:46.220> we<00:01:47.220> have<00:01:47.430> also<00:01:47.700> kodak<00:01:48.690> portrait<00:01:49.409> 160<00:01:50.070> VC

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
and we have also kodak portrait 160 VC

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.210 
and we have also kodak portrait 160 VC
so<00:01:50.790> that's<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.230> color<00:01:52.230> negative<00:01:52.710> film<00:01:52.740> and

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
so that's a color negative film and

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.960 
so that's a color negative film and
that's<00:01:53.520> designed<00:01:54.300> for<00:01:55.110> people<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.520> has<00:01:56.940> a

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
that's designed for people so it has a

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.720 
that's designed for people so it has a
bias<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.780> skin<00:01:58.020> tones<00:01:58.260> for<00:01:58.860> this<00:01:59.010> one<00:01:59.250> let's<00:01:59.520> go

00:01:59.720 --> 00:01:59.730 
bias to skin tones for this one let's go

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.760 
bias to skin tones for this one let's go
ahead<00:01:59.760> and<00:02:00.210> take<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.390> look<00:02:00.690> at<00:02:00.870> the<00:02:01.229> other<00:02:01.409> films

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.370 
ahead and take a look at the other films
we<00:02:01.890> have<00:02:02.040> available<00:02:02.580> so<00:02:03.080> from<00:02:04.080> the<00:02:04.170> drop-down

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
grain has been replicated just

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.950 
grain has been replicated just
beautifully

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
beautifully

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.330 
beautifully
so<00:02:31.770> here's<00:02:32.040> Fuji<00:02:32.570> superior<00:02:34.070> 1600<00:02:35.070> that's

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
so here's Fuji superior 1600 that's

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.770 
so here's Fuji superior 1600 that's
replicating<00:02:35.940> a<00:02:36.030> 1600<00:02:36.900> ISO<00:02:37.410> film

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.470 

so<00:02:41.560> now<00:02:41.770> we'll<00:02:41.920> get<00:02:42.040> into<00:02:42.100> the<00:02:42.400> chrome<00:02:42.940> films

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
so now we'll get into the chrome films

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.960 
so now we'll get into the chrome films
chrome<00:02:43.990> is<00:02:44.320> the<00:02:44.860> debt<00:02:45.070> means<00:02:45.400> that<00:02:45.670> it's<00:02:45.850> a

chrome is the debt means that it's a

is changing the sensitivity to the

beautiful<00:03:41.650> job<00:03:41.950> replicating<00:03:42.370> those<00:03:42.970> film

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
beautiful job replicating those film

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.470 
beautiful job replicating those film
types<00:03:44.280> so<00:03:45.280> for<00:03:45.430> this<00:03:45.519> one<00:03:45.730> let's<00:03:45.760> go<00:03:46.090> ahead<00:03:46.299> and

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
types so for this one let's go ahead and

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.060 
types so for this one let's go ahead and
go<00:03:46.600> with<00:03:47.130> fuji<00:03:48.130> superior<00:03:49.410> 400<00:03:50.410> it's<00:03:50.890> got<00:03:51.040> a

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
go with fuji superior 400 it's got a

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.130 
go with fuji superior 400 it's got a
little<00:03:51.250> bit<00:03:51.459> of<00:03:51.519> a<00:03:51.610> grain<00:03:51.820> to<00:03:52.239> it<00:03:52.390> nice

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
little bit of a grain to it nice

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.789 
little bit of a grain to it nice
contrast<00:03:54.390> beautiful<00:03:55.390> the<00:03:56.140> way<00:03:56.260> it's<00:03:56.440> picking

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
contrast beautiful the way it's picking

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.590 
contrast beautiful the way it's picking
up<00:03:56.890> the<00:03:56.950> greens<00:03:57.340> next<00:03:58.180> we<00:03:58.299> have<00:03:58.450> the

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
up the greens next we have the

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.120 
up the greens next we have the
brightness<00:03:58.840> slider<00:03:59.230> which<00:03:59.530> controls<00:03:59.950> the

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
brightness slider which controls the

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.820 
brightness slider which controls the
overall<00:04:00.519> brightness<00:04:00.760> of<00:04:01.120> the<00:04:01.239> image<00:04:01.269> and<00:04:01.840> for

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
overall brightness of the image and for

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.860 
overall brightness of the image and for
this<00:04:02.920> one<00:04:03.130> i<00:04:03.160> think<00:04:03.280> the<00:04:03.730> exposure<00:04:04.060> is<00:04:04.390> perfect

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
this one i think the exposure is perfect

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.270 
this one i think the exposure is perfect
so<00:04:04.989> we<00:04:05.110> don't<00:04:05.260> need<00:04:05.380> to<00:04:05.530> do<00:04:05.799> anything<00:04:06.160> with

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
so we don't need to do anything with

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.009 
so we don't need to do anything with
that<00:04:06.310> if<00:04:06.730> we<00:04:06.760> wanted<00:04:07.180> to<00:04:07.299> brighten<00:04:07.510> it<00:04:07.690> we<00:04:07.840> just

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
that if we wanted to brighten it we just

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.170 
that if we wanted to brighten it we just
move<00:04:08.170> it<00:04:08.320> to<00:04:08.410> the<00:04:08.530> right<00:04:08.850> next<00:04:09.850> we<00:04:10.030> have

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
move it to the right next we have

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.050 
move it to the right next we have
contrast<00:04:10.720> that<00:04:11.230> defaults<00:04:11.769> at<00:04:11.860> 0%<00:04:12.340> and<00:04:12.790> if<00:04:12.970> we

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
contrast that defaults at 0% and if we

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.630 
contrast that defaults at 0% and if we
wanted<00:04:13.299> to<00:04:13.450> increase<00:04:13.810> the<00:04:14.049> contrast<00:04:14.430> we<00:04:15.430> can

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
wanted to increase the contrast we can

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.569 
wanted to increase the contrast we can
do<00:04:15.790> that<00:04:15.970> here<00:04:16.299> i<00:04:16.709> think<00:04:17.709> the<00:04:17.919> contrast<00:04:18.340> looks

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
do that here i think the contrast looks

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.020 
do that here i think the contrast looks
great<00:04:18.970> so<00:04:19.209> we'll<00:04:19.329> leave<00:04:19.479> that<00:04:19.690> alone<00:04:19.840> and<00:04:21.030> here

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
great so we'll leave that alone and here

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.180 
great so we'll leave that alone and here
we<00:04:22.150> have<00:04:22.330> the<00:04:22.479> film<00:04:22.810> detail<00:04:23.440> so<00:04:23.770> if<00:04:23.919> we<00:04:24.040> click

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
we have the film detail so if we click

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.480 
we have the film detail so if we click
on<00:04:24.340> this<00:04:24.640> triangle<00:04:25.620> we'll<00:04:26.620> open<00:04:26.800> up<00:04:27.040> the<00:04:27.220> film

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
on this triangle we'll open up the film

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.480 
on this triangle we'll open up the film
details<00:04:28.000> menu<00:04:28.740> and<00:04:29.740> here<00:04:29.919> you<00:04:30.040> can<00:04:30.130> see<00:04:30.340> it's

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
details menu and here you can see it's

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.300 
details menu and here you can see it's
it's<00:04:30.729> separated<00:04:31.419> into<00:04:31.770> sections<00:04:32.770> the<00:04:33.280> first

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
it's separated into sections the first

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.180 
it's separated into sections the first
section<00:04:33.610> is<00:04:34.090> sensitivity<00:04:34.919> so<00:04:35.919> we<00:04:36.040> have

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
section is sensitivity so we have

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.180 
section is sensitivity so we have
control<00:04:36.550> over<00:04:36.840> the<00:04:37.840> read<00:04:38.110> sensitivity<00:04:38.950> the

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
control over the read sensitivity the

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.980 
control over the read sensitivity the
yellow<00:04:39.640> green<00:04:40.600> cyan<00:04:41.020> blue<00:04:41.890> and<00:04:42.550> violet<00:04:42.880> so<00:04:43.810> for

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
yellow green cyan blue and violet so for

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.060 
yellow green cyan blue and violet so for
this<00:04:44.080> image<00:04:44.380> there's<00:04:44.530> a<00:04:44.560> lot<00:04:44.710> of<00:04:44.830> green<00:04:45.040> in

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
this image there's a lot of green in

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.850 
this image there's a lot of green in
there<00:04:45.400> so<00:04:45.580> let's<00:04:45.729> take<00:04:46.169> the<00:04:47.169> green<00:04:47.500> slider

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
there so let's take the green slider

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.390 
there so let's take the green slider
which<00:04:48.160> defaults<00:04:48.550> to<00:04:48.700> 25%<00:04:49.560> and<00:04:50.560> if<00:04:50.680> we<00:04:50.800> increase

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
which defaults to 25% and if we increase

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.860 
which defaults to 25% and if we increase
that<00:04:51.570> we'll<00:04:52.570> see

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
that we'll see

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.740 
that we'll see
Green's<00:04:53.500> increase<00:04:54.340> but<00:04:55.000> nothing<00:04:55.360> else<00:04:55.570> is

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
Green's increase but nothing else is

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.260 
Green's increase but nothing else is
touched<00:04:56.020> if<00:04:57.010> we<00:04:57.220> decrease<00:04:57.520> that<00:04:58.060> will

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
touched if we decrease that will

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.420 
touched if we decrease that will
decrease<00:04:58.690> the<00:04:59.620> sensitivity<00:05:00.310> to<00:05:00.340> green<00:05:02.250> and<00:05:03.250> I

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
decrease the sensitivity to green and I

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.010 
decrease the sensitivity to green and I
think<00:05:03.640> I<00:05:03.700> liked<00:05:03.940> that<00:05:04.030> best<00:05:04.390> right<00:05:04.780> where<00:05:04.930> it

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
think I liked that best right where it

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.810 
think I liked that best right where it
was<00:05:05.200> at<00:05:05.440> 25<00:05:05.770> percent<00:05:06.280> so<00:05:06.340> we'll<00:05:06.520> leave<00:05:06.700> it

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
was at 25 percent so we'll leave it

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.560 
was at 25 percent so we'll leave it
right<00:05:06.910> there<00:05:07.380> next<00:05:08.380> we<00:05:08.620> have<00:05:08.770> saturation<00:05:09.610> so

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
right there next we have saturation so

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.270 
right there next we have saturation so
again<00:05:10.840> we'll<00:05:11.020> use<00:05:11.050> green<00:05:11.440> sunscreens<00:05:12.040> the

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
again we'll use green sunscreens the

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.270 
again we'll use green sunscreens the
main<00:05:12.790> color<00:05:13.090> in<00:05:13.240> this<00:05:13.360> image<00:05:13.570> if<00:05:14.410> we<00:05:14.560> increase

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
main color in this image if we increase

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.420 
main color in this image if we increase
that<00:05:15.310> from<00:05:15.850> the<00:05:16.000> default<00:05:16.360> of<00:05:16.510> three<00:05:16.810> percent

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
that from the default of three percent

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.280 
that from the default of three percent
we're<00:05:18.430> gonna<00:05:18.580> increase<00:05:19.360> the<00:05:19.420> saturation<00:05:19.750> of

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
we're gonna increase the saturation of

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.620 
we're gonna increase the saturation of
the<00:05:20.320> greens<00:05:20.620> if<00:05:21.520> we<00:05:21.700> wanted<00:05:21.970> to<00:05:22.030> reduce<00:05:22.450> the

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
the greens if we wanted to reduce the

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.050 
the greens if we wanted to reduce the
saturation<00:05:22.840> of<00:05:23.320> the<00:05:23.380> greens<00:05:23.650> we<00:05:23.920> can<00:05:24.160> do<00:05:24.880> that

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
saturation of the greens we can do that

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.780 
saturation of the greens we can do that
also<00:05:25.300> and<00:05:25.930> we<00:05:26.050> kind<00:05:26.290> of<00:05:26.380> balance<00:05:26.860> it<00:05:26.980> out<00:05:27.160> it's

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
also and we kind of balance it out it's

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.610 
also and we kind of balance it out it's
got<00:05:27.910> an<00:05:28.060> even<00:05:28.390> tone<00:05:28.570> throughout<00:05:28.960> but<00:05:29.290> I<00:05:29.320> think

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
got an even tone throughout but I think

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.620 
got an even tone throughout but I think
where<00:05:32.620> that<00:05:32.860> was<00:05:33.130> at<00:05:33.400> three<00:05:33.700> percent<00:05:33.910> is<00:05:34.360> just

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
where that was at three percent is just

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:42.450 
where that was at three percent is just
perfect<00:05:35.620> and<00:05:37.710> next<00:05:38.710> we<00:05:38.860> also<00:05:39.010> have<00:05:40.830> tone<00:05:41.830> curve

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
perfect and next we also have tone curve

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.690 
perfect and next we also have tone curve
and<00:05:43.030> we<00:05:43.570> can<00:05:43.750> do<00:05:43.870> it<00:05:43.900> by<00:05:44.170> channel<00:05:44.650> click<00:05:45.430> on<00:05:45.550> the

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
and we can do it by channel click on the

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.370 
and we can do it by channel click on the
drop<00:05:45.880> down<00:05:45.910> menu<00:05:46.360> we<00:05:46.540> see<00:05:46.720> that<00:05:46.840> we<00:05:46.990> have<00:05:47.170> the

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
drop down menu we see that we have the

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.100 
drop down menu we see that we have the
ability<00:05:47.890> to<00:05:47.920> do<00:05:48.160> all<00:05:48.400> three<00:05:49.240> channels<00:05:49.690> at<00:05:50.080> the

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
ability to do all three channels at the

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.280 
ability to do all three channels at the
same<00:05:50.410> time<00:05:50.680> red<00:05:51.010> green<00:05:51.280> and<00:05:51.610> blue<00:05:52.020> we<00:05:53.020> can<00:05:53.170> do

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:53.290 
same time red green and blue we can do

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.260 
same time red green and blue we can do
the<00:05:53.410> luminosity<00:05:53.830> channel<00:05:54.490> or<00:05:54.670> we<00:05:54.940> could<00:05:55.120> do

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
the luminosity channel or we could do

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.750 
the luminosity channel or we could do
the<00:05:55.420> red<00:05:55.720> green<00:05:56.350> or<00:05:56.680> blue<00:05:56.760> channels

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:57.760 
the red green or blue channels

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.080 
the red green or blue channels
separately<00:05:58.330> and<00:05:59.290> then<00:06:00.220> we<00:06:00.340> also<00:06:00.490> have<00:06:00.700> control

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
separately and then we also have control

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.280 
separately and then we also have control
over<00:06:01.120> the<00:06:01.540> opacity<00:06:01.960> and<00:06:02.530> then<00:06:03.430> next<00:06:03.640> we<00:06:03.910> have

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:04.290 
over the opacity and then next we have

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:07.440 
over the opacity and then next we have
grain<00:06:05.290> the<00:06:06.130> more<00:06:06.370> grains<00:06:06.670> there<00:06:06.940> are<00:06:07.090> per

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:07.450 
grain the more grains there are per

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:10.620 
grain the more grains there are per
pixel<00:06:07.750> the<00:06:08.590> less<00:06:08.890> you<00:06:09.130> notice<00:06:09.490> the<00:06:09.640> grain<00:06:09.880> if

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
pixel the less you notice the grain if

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.550 
pixel the less you notice the grain if
we<00:06:10.750> take<00:06:10.930> this<00:06:11.200> slider<00:06:11.560> and<00:06:12.300> we<00:06:13.300> do<00:06:13.930> that<00:06:14.350> we

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 
we take this slider and we do that we

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.270 
we take this slider and we do that we
take<00:06:14.770> that<00:06:14.950> down<00:06:15.190> to<00:06:15.400> one<00:06:15.700> grain<00:06:16.000> per<00:06:16.270> pixel

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 
take that down to one grain per pixel

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.860 
take that down to one grain per pixel
you<00:06:18.280> can<00:06:18.490> see<00:06:18.730> how<00:06:18.880> much<00:06:19.030> more<00:06:19.270> grain<00:06:19.540> there<00:06:19.750> is

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:19.870 
you can see how much more grain there is

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:23.820 
you can see how much more grain there is
now<00:06:20.110> so<00:06:20.380> if<00:06:20.530> we<00:06:20.650> take<00:06:20.800> that<00:06:20.860> up<00:06:21.130> to<00:06:21.160> 500<00:06:22.830> putting

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:23.830 
now so if we take that up to 500 putting

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.900 
now so if we take that up to 500 putting
500<00:06:24.640> grains<00:06:24.940> on<00:06:25.270> each<00:06:25.840> pixel<00:06:26.530> so<00:06:27.400> you

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:27.910 
500 grains on each pixel so you

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.450 
500 grains on each pixel so you
basically<00:06:28.150> have<00:06:28.480> no<00:06:28.810> grain<00:06:29.020> and<00:06:29.310> then<00:06:30.310> you

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:30.460 
basically have no grain and then you

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.960 
basically have no grain and then you
have<00:06:30.670> soft<00:06:31.360> or<00:06:31.720> hard<00:06:32.010> which<00:06:33.010> will<00:06:33.520> increase

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:33.970 
have soft or hard which will increase

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.090 
have soft or hard which will increase
the<00:06:34.090> apparent<00:06:34.630> sharpness<00:06:35.320> based<00:06:35.740> on

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:36.100 
the apparent sharpness based on

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.640 
the apparent sharpness based on
sharpening<00:06:36.760> up<00:06:36.970> the<00:06:37.120> grain<00:06:37.420> in<00:06:38.080> the<00:06:38.170> pixels

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:38.650 
sharpening up the grain in the pixels

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.620 
sharpening up the grain in the pixels
and<00:06:39.070> if<00:06:39.460> we<00:06:39.580> move<00:06:39.910> it<00:06:40.060> all<00:06:40.180> the<00:06:40.210> way<00:06:40.360> over<00:06:40.480> to

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:40.630 
and if we move it all the way over to

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.050 
and if we move it all the way over to
soft<00:06:40.900> you<00:06:41.200> can<00:06:41.320> see<00:06:41.500> how<00:06:41.620> much<00:06:41.740> softer<00:06:42.280> the

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:43.060 
soft you can see how much softer the

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.600 
soft you can see how much softer the
image<00:06:43.330> is<00:06:43.540> so<00:06:44.170> I<00:06:44.200> think<00:06:44.320> the<00:06:44.590> defaults<00:06:45.370> vary

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:45.610 
image is so I think the defaults vary

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:46.920 
image is so I think the defaults vary
and<00:06:45.670> actually<00:06:45.940> right<00:06:46.120> there<00:06:46.360> in<00:06:46.480> the<00:06:46.570> middle

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:46.930 
and actually right there in the middle

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:49.340 
and actually right there in the middle
so<00:06:47.590> don't<00:06:47.740> put<00:06:47.890> it<00:06:47.980> right<00:06:48.100> back<00:06:48.280> there<00:06:48.490> and

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:49.350 
so don't put it right back there and

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:54.870 
so don't put it right back there and
that's<00:06:51.510> the<00:06:52.510> film<00:06:52.840> details<00:06:53.470> menu<00:06:54.010> and<00:06:54.430> the

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880 
that's the film details menu and the

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.400 
that's the film details menu and the
controls<00:06:55.300> available<00:06:55.840> so<00:06:55.960> you<00:06:56.080> can<00:06:56.230> create

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:56.410 
controls available so you can create

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:58.470 
controls available so you can create
your<00:06:56.500> own<00:06:56.710> film<00:06:57.130> a<00:06:57.370> film<00:06:57.730> that's<00:06:57.970> never<00:06:58.240> been

00:06:58.470 --> 00:06:58.480 
your own film a film that's never been

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.630 
your own film a film that's never been
done<00:06:58.540> by<00:06:59.080> adjusting<00:06:59.590> those<00:06:59.800> sliders<00:07:00.160> and<00:07:00.520> then

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:00.640 
done by adjusting those sliders and then

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.760
