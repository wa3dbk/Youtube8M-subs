00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
when we step back just a little you can

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.320 
when we step back just a little you can
see<00:02:20.340> totally<00:02:20.880> just<00:02:21.240> blends<00:02:21.630> into<00:02:21.930> my<00:02:22.820> eyes<00:02:23.820> I

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
see totally just blends into my eyes I

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.750 
see totally just blends into my eyes I
think<00:02:24.630> it's<00:02:25.020> because<00:02:25.170> I<00:02:25.830> have<00:02:26.220> smaller<00:02:26.640> eyes

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
think it's because I have smaller eyes

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.720 
think it's because I have smaller eyes
so<00:02:27.390> it<00:02:27.750> just<00:02:28.170> kind<00:02:28.350> of<00:02:28.380> casts<00:02:28.830> a<00:02:28.920> shadow<00:02:28.950> over

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
so it just kind of casts a shadow over

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.930
