00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 hi all nice that you watch this again 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.460
 is a what's in my shopping bag 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.080
 video and I show you what 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.570
 I have all done a message 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.190
 I already unpacked yesterday without it 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.110
 is the accent soon to show which 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.059
 three are because I already use them 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.130
 or have been out on the street sheep 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.080
 laid 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:23.189
 I show you what I bought 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.510
 first I bought a free me 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.949
 actually use it as a very large one 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.869
 spring onion by salad i rise 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.519
 rings and so I did not stand up 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.679
 I think warm brain is real 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.450
 not tasty at all but in a different way 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.399
 way i just think it's raw 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.260
 sliced by gradually very tasty 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.260
 so hence bought the pepper 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.920
 Then it can also be bought your own 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.410
 as you can see it has been with lidl and 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.120
 another supermarket on the way 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.030
 league or buy is also simply own with 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.920
 the first digit 0 and that I that the 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.559
 most friendly eggs are you 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.480
 can buy in the supermarket is actually so 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.649
 you can buy them with leo 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.750
 then that I bought straws everywhere and that 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.909
 I turn off smoothie with red fruit 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.380
 the freezer that you already have such packaging 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.450
 Albert Heijn's faith came before 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.640
 fruit 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.799
 no do I add one or I do 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.580
 it with goat cheese and beets and pure 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.960
 chocolate 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.960
 so hence I bought this one 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.030
 I also bought a farmer now 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.950
 yes multifunctional you can see everywhere 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.660
 go through and in a moment 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.820
 then I also bought a bell pepper 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:35.020
 and red I think that green had one 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.370
 bit bitter and so is the yellow finca 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.870
 nice, but that rony is 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.760
 so often nice because of food 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.340
 hence being able to buy red pepper 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:46.150
 and then I have to click this 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.860
 tomato purchased peeled tomato 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:53.080
 do this for example with lentil soup 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:54.850
 or homo the soup or I make it 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.860
 tomato sauce fall corrupted for example 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.170
 very easy of them is really very 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.910
 handy to always have in stock 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.700
 you can really really make your own sauce there 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:07.270
 then I also have a pack of milk 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.810
 I actually bought that for us 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.570
 I mainly drink for this potato 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.560
 variation cupcakes and this got from 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.350
 scarlet 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.150
 as a tip and this I am going to make it 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.640
 I will show you a video or this 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.489
 really nice timmy fall or the easy 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.140
 to create and book and if I case 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.180
 a pack of milk for he doesn't need it 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.950
 whole suit I believe but I had to half 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.110
 full of milk so hence the 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.320
 retreat and you can do that next 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:38.230
 do n't even expect a video 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.330
 apples bought are pink lady apples 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.340
 this not just about supermarket 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.220
 and I bought this at the lidl 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:50.230
 had and yes I think what a tasty 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:51.370
 sweet juicy apples twitter I 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.110
 then again did not buy a lie 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.670
 of course your arc is his duty 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.230
 chicken pieces from the vegetarian butcher 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.390
 as you can see 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.340
 and now I often do dishes in which 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.500
 this is really tasty as 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.360
 for example , aim a state sign 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.720
 Asian 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:13.770
 see you soon or I will stir it 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.510
 and it went so it looks like this 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.010
 seems a bit like chicken it just has 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.050
 slightly different structure in slightly different 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.490
 is that does not do chicken but can 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.350
 really super good used as a replacement 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.580
 and it seems I think so 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.550
 people who have meat for a long time 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.410
 eaten very much anyway 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.530
 then sit in place of tielen bag and 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:35.550
 began to serve bataks well this is the 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:38.640
 uneven nothing and peter nothing of that brand 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:41.580
 of the series also very tasty ones 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.980
 buy scart regularly and this is also 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.989
 really good and nicely salted 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.060
 all kinds of notion pieces only 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.500
 then bought bananas I have already 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.739
 one of hope so I still have now 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.450
 two kidneys on the fruit plate and so on 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.040
 I also bought this yeast 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.200
 I was a regular juice morning 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.690
 or I throw in a glass of fresh hour and sometimes 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.280
 you have to go and I have that as 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.180
 a fruit bowl is all laid 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.130
 easy 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.709
 and then I am nice in the kitchen 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.660
 two more things in a pot and that's this 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.950
 dried fruit is a cat sachet 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.750
 torn open 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.660
 There is nothing done in the pot and state 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.630
 of course also nice so this is 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.220
 according to my plum and apricot and 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.780
 dried pieces of apple and it is real 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.280
 Very good 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.380
 and I usually eat it from masters 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.840

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.860

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.440
