00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:21.320
 hello people do video again by 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:25.670
 about the settings we play and install 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:30.239
 sprocket piston set 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:38.940
 top dead center and aptly here 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:42.110
 the viewing window is marked opposite where and here 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.460
 from screwed bolt on the side of the head 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:51.320
 screwed 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:54.710
 Well, I put this star opposite 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.710
 this hole 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:56.080
 and one more 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.100
 how is the camshaft open valve 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.070
 are closed 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:06.160
 it doesn't matter the star hole and 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:09.100
 tapped holes on the camshaft they 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.200
 not evenly spaced and asterisk not 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.720
 put well, no way 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.720
 it only turns out 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.220
 asterisk 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:42.550
 cranking rotate revolt he's a son in front 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:47.260
 shaft rotate is equal now will begin 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:51.310
 open the valve and stop here 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:03:01.540
 camshaft stopped here 2 hole 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:03:03.459
 matched and there is no third rotate further well 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:13.450
 and hold on to joe. 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:19.299
 so as not to fly off and here all let tags 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:21.970
 there the sense there by the labels does not match 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:33.730
 let it be and just fasten and 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:37.359
 all clamping bolts is not necessary here 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:43.829
 rotate here rotate the whole engine all 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:43.829
 don't need enough extra effort 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:04:04.840
 like this mother then check carried out 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:04:10.420
 but everything will rotate the router looking 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.420
 label letter t 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.650
 here 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:38.910
 here it is 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:48.580
 the label is hard to see well, and there is a letter t next 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:52.960
 here we have as a video city 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:56.250
 slightly gets to the main label 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:05:00.910
 how can you seem to the camera that she 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:04.920
 exactly on the mark on if slightly 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.920
 look closer she doesnâ€™t get much 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:17.320
 Well, such things about the installation 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:21.360
 asterisks heroin settings by tags on 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.360
