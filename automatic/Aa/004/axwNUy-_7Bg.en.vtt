00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.140
 special still things inside these 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.460
 Kanak cans if you have not seen my tutorial 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.500
 of makeup for valentine's day 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.359
 I'll leave the link in the part of 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.189
 down they want to learn how to prepare these 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.310
 be better just keep watching 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.090
 the video so let's start with the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.210
 ingredients and what they will need is 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:39.810
 200 grams of butter 150 grams of 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.920
 powdered sugar 4 yolks 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:47.070
 180 grams of sifted flour 320 grams 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:51.150
 of cornstarch 2 teaspoons of powder 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.370
 Bake 1 teaspoon sweet vanilla 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.710
 of milk, powdered sugar and grated coconut 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.940
 I will also use those vouchers and pouches 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.100
 to decorate so let's start we're going to 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.530
 start beating the butter that the 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.390
 I have at room temperature I'm 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.680
 using a hand mixer but if not 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.730
 they have a hand beater simply 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.590
 Can you use a wooden spoon? 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.979
 to start adding sugar powder 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.910
 little by little until the dough is 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:24.670
 put creamy then let's add the 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.350
 egg yolks and inches 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.659
 and they already realize that the hand is 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.409
 putting a little yellow that's the 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:34.149
 characteristic color of alfajor no 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.570
 It always has a nice color 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:36.570
 yellow 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.549
 then we are going to add a little bit of 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.270
 vanilla essence to give it a flavor 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.759
 richest one 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.859
 once we mix this let's leave 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.140
 the blender next door and taking a 

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:54.770
 spatula let's start adding the 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.830
 dry ingredients that have already sifted 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.170
 and mixed them all 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.850
 and we're going to start adding if from 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.430
 little they will realize that the dough 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.310
 it is getting a little bit more and more 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.040
 thicker so let's remove the 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.860
 spatula and using the after our 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.980
 clean hands let's start adding 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.010
 the rest of the dry ingredients 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:21.830
 trying to merge all the ingredients 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:25.490
 in this way until we form a 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.800
 masita well as I'm doing 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.650
 I'm going to train like this in this way and the 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.870
 I'm going to cover it with a plastic or you can 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.300
 put in a bag so that we are not 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.370
 go take it out once it's okay 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.550
 the cover will let stand for 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.000
 one hour 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:46.600
 and now it's time to stretch after a 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.640
 little bit of flour on the table and also 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.580
 on the roller if you do not have a roller 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.640
 there is a problem they can use a bottle 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:59.330
 We will continue to stretch and if it breaks 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:02.690
 the mass do not worry but let's 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:05.300
 cut some circles I have this 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.790
 dough cutter but if you do not have this 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.730
 they can simply use a glass or 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.260
 a cup what they have available I 'll go 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.620
 to grab these discs and I'm going to 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.670
 place in a can that already 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.230
 buttered and has put a 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.450
 little piece of paper so that it will not stick 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.390
 do not pour flour alone milk butter 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.400
 so that it no longer sticks then we 're going to 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.540
 order until we see that they put a 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.390
 a little bit 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.689
 and then taking the dulce de leche let's go 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.150
 to start filling the cookies 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:38.950
 you put the amount you want to 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.829
 I like super sweet so I'm going to 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.890
 add extra and we join you well with another 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:46.060
 cookie and we leave it to the side and we are 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.700
 the same with all the others 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.409
 cookies then I'm going to go through 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.879
 coconut because I like coconut but 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:54.579
 if you did not embed the coconut there is no 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:57.640
 problem and do the same with the others 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:04:00.310
 cookies look how pretty they look 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.610
 let's sprinkle a little sugar 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:07.260
 powder on both sides of the cookie 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.260
 you are going to fold them this way 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.550
 and I'm going to put a lot of sugar in 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.760
 dust because I love that it's 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.980
 so super super sweet I 'm not going to take it 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.739
 These little bags that I bought as I had them 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.470
 They said that cost a world revived 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.120
 a lot of them so I'm not going to 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.560
 put here you can put the amount that 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.560
 you like that I am putting 2 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:36.300
 you can not put three I do not know that you 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:38.699
 want or if they want one depending on 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.680
 who are giving it to you then we are going to 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:42.419
 close the bags and they came with these 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.580
 clues so that's what I'm going to 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:47.099
 use to close them can make you 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.980
 a little bun with what you have 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:51.470
 available is fine 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.780
 and we think the same with the rest and for 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.790
 just a little bit more special to get 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.830
 You're latitas so that I will put 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.930
 inside the cans and that's how the 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.140
 I will deliver can put one or two 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.640
 bags as you like and that's 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.670
 all for the video I hope you have them 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.710
