00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 all those doubts I had every and 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.109
 everyone who didn't believe me and that 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.580
 was suddenly gone that was over and I hear 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.210
 just make music in the case 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.929
 what i wanted 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:21.060
 and that it just felt like sort of 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:24.680
 rest a kind of peace and 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.680
 who we are 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.660
 look 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:40.760
 the girl you are not like that 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:44.089
 and then they find 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.339
 people around you who loved you 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:49.460
 it always strange that I did it 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:52.039
 and he doesn't understand this and I even became one 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.409
 just ridiculously openwork 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.570
 what everyone in my area associates 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:58.729
 that is very narrow but you associate 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.920
 wrap right with violence 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:03.579
 James Joyce Drugs think of the body 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.579
 make own 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.150
 you will already have seen the mouse on TV 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.260
 and I was the chance with me in the final 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.540
 i will be there in my high school 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.250
 They were filming at the school so 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.650
 in that liver all that school that day 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.200
 suddenly there would never be one 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.040
 camera action plague every room of 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.040
 bio leather spoken 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.440
 and had 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.770
 he those girls 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:43.050
 a support and I got much more 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.150
 pleasure if you don't have much left 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.860
 have fun with friends and the 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.970
 that's why I already had that freedom 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:54.960
 start that everyone has my bicycle 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.820
 says i sometimes have to take care of you for you 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.700
 neither love nor our boys who know how 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.140
 you in the musical field 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.729
 especially if you are a Dutch-speaking person 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.810
 texts 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:09.929
 is used in the Netherlands for very flat 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.660
 For example, why is being a French 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.030
 bauer turned over 200 times and 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.430
 something with actually the good text 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:22.050
 we do what goes deep as for example 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:24.660
 sticks barely knocks on the radio 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.470
 is just that a lot of people 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.470
 want to understand 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.100
 No 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.780
 you are 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.840
 ask ebury 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.840

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.530
 big and and don't like that and the 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.989
 other side 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.290
 I try to say it my way 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.849
 but that to have so anyway 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.890
 something commercial to do but with 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:59.989
 kidding one or trying to be with 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.989
 keep America strong or 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.840
 yes it must really mean something to me 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.160
 don't really go for the taste that team goes for 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.459
 mean nothing to me so that they become 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.459
 turned 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.200
