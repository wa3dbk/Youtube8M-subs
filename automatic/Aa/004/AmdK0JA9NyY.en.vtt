big volume bag put a couple dogs in here
and<00:02:28.550> you<00:02:29.000> just<00:02:31.210> watch<00:02:32.210> it<00:02:32.270> on<00:02:32.480> like<00:02:32.660> that<00:02:32.690> you

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
and you just watch it on like that you

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.390 
and you just watch it on like that you
ready<00:02:33.830> to<00:02:33.890> go<00:02:35.320> so<00:02:36.320> the<00:02:36.500> weight<00:02:36.650> is<00:02:36.680> supported

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
ready to go so the weight is supported

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.010 
ready to go so the weight is supported
by<00:02:37.760> this<00:02:37.820> and<00:02:39.010> and<00:02:40.030> that<00:02:41.030> undertray<00:02:41.570> supports

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
by this and and that undertray supports

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.990 
by this and and that undertray supports
it<00:02:42.110> too<00:02:42.260> so<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:43.190> fact<00:02:43.400> that<00:02:43.490> they<00:02:43.640> went<00:02:43.850> with

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
it too so the fact that they went with

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.720 
it too so the fact that they went with
aluminum<00:02:44.620> meant<00:02:45.620> that<00:02:45.890> it<00:02:46.130> stayed<00:02:46.370> relatively

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
aluminum meant that it stayed relatively

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.910 
aluminum meant that it stayed relatively
light<00:02:47.120> and<00:02:47.420> they<00:02:48.110> were<00:02:48.170> able<00:02:48.470> to<00:02:48.500> make<00:02:48.710> some

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
light and they were able to make some

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.520 
light and they were able to make some
huge<00:02:50.350> material<00:02:51.350> here<00:02:51.770> make<00:02:52.640> this<00:02:52.820> thing<00:02:53.030> stiff

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
huge material here make this thing stiff

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.110 
huge material here make this thing stiff
look<00:02:54.530> at<00:02:54.650> that<00:02:54.770> has<00:02:55.220> a<00:02:55.250> capacity<00:02:55.460> of<00:02:55.880> 200

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
look at that has a capacity of 200

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.490 
look at that has a capacity of 200
pounds<00:02:57.790> back<00:02:58.790> here

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500

bakers<00:04:14.600> disc<00:04:14.870> and<00:04:15.290> rear<00:04:16.160> brake<00:04:16.580> is<00:04:17.680> v<00:04:18.680> brake

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
bakers disc and rear brake is v brake

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.469 
bakers disc and rear brake is v brake
I<00:04:19.220> think<00:04:19.700> they<00:04:19.760> saved<00:04:19.970> a<00:04:20.030> little<00:04:20.090> bit<00:04:20.209> of<00:04:20.359> money

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
I think they saved a little bit of money

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.570 
I think they saved a little bit of money
there<00:04:20.620> I'll<00:04:21.620> probably<00:04:21.830> upgrade<00:04:22.220> it<00:04:22.370> but<00:04:22.550> I

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
there I'll probably upgrade it but I

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.790 
there I'll probably upgrade it but I
thought<00:04:22.790> I<00:04:23.120> tried<00:04:23.540> it<00:04:23.660> today<00:04:23.750> it's<00:04:24.320> awesome<00:04:24.680> it

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
thought I tried it today it's awesome it

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.010 
thought I tried it today it's awesome it
works<00:04:24.890> good<00:04:25.190> I<00:04:25.430> think<00:04:26.390> the<00:04:26.479> key<00:04:26.630> would<00:04:26.810> brakes

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
works good I think the key would brakes

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.630 
works good I think the key would brakes
is<00:04:27.169> that<00:04:27.290> they<00:04:27.380> have<00:04:27.500> a<00:04:27.530> similar<00:04:27.919> feel<00:04:28.190> fun<00:04:28.490> and

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
is that they have a similar feel fun and

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.130 
is that they have a similar feel fun and
rear<00:04:28.760> you<00:04:29.510> know<00:04:30.070> and<00:04:31.510> as<00:04:32.510> long<00:04:32.690> as<00:04:32.720> they<00:04:32.840> obtain

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
rear you know and as long as they obtain

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.640 
rear you know and as long as they obtain
that<00:04:33.520> ammos<00:04:34.520> your<00:04:34.760> power<00:04:34.940> anyway<00:04:35.479> I<00:04:35.960> think<00:04:36.380> 60

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
that ammos your power anyway I think 60

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.110 
that ammos your power anyway I think 60
70<00:04:37.010> percent<00:04:37.250> of<00:04:37.310> your<00:04:37.370> powers<00:04:37.700> on<00:04:37.820> the<00:04:37.910> front

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
70 percent of your powers on the front

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.990 
70 percent of your powers on the front
so<00:04:38.270> it<00:04:38.390> works<00:04:38.570> works<00:04:39.289> well<00:04:39.470> for<00:04:39.500> now<00:04:40.000> little

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
so it works works well for now little

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.890 
so it works works well for now little
tray<00:04:41.180> here

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
tray here

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.930 
tray here
so<00:04:43.040> what<00:04:44.040> do<00:04:44.100> I<00:04:44.190> think<00:04:44.220> about<00:04:44.640> it

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
so what do I think about it

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.330 
so what do I think about it
Oh<00:04:44.970> kick<00:04:45.750> stab<00:04:45.990> look<00:04:46.500> at<00:04:46.590> this<00:04:46.680> kickstand<00:04:47.040> it's

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
Oh kick stab look at this kickstand it's

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.410 
Oh kick stab look at this kickstand it's
a<00:04:48.170> it's<00:04:49.170> a<00:04:49.350> dual<00:04:49.560> side<00:04:49.860> super<00:04:50.670> cool<00:04:50.850> aluminum

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
a it's a dual side super cool aluminum

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.160 
a it's a dual side super cool aluminum
what's<00:04:52.170> cool<00:04:52.350> about<00:04:52.380> it<00:04:52.620> is<00:04:52.970> um<00:04:54.020> you<00:04:55.020> can

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170 
what's cool about it is um you can

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.410 
what's cool about it is um you can
actually<00:04:55.290> work<00:04:55.620> on<00:04:55.800> it<00:04:55.980> while<00:04:56.790> it's<00:04:56.940> up<00:04:57.060> there

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
actually work on it while it's up there

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.880 
actually work on it while it's up there
you<00:04:57.780> know<00:04:57.870> it's<00:04:57.990> tuning<00:04:58.260> my<00:04:58.350> brakes<00:04:58.620> and

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
you know it's tuning my brakes and

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.740 
you know it's tuning my brakes and
whatnot<00:04:59.190> because<00:04:59.700> it's<00:04:59.970> not<00:05:00.120> that<00:05:00.150> easy<00:05:00.330> to

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
whatnot because it's not that easy to

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.150 
whatnot because it's not that easy to
put<00:05:00.900> this<00:05:00.990> up<00:05:01.170> on<00:05:01.260> a<00:05:01.320> bike<00:05:01.530> stand<00:05:03.710> two<00:05:04.710> by<00:05:04.860> two

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
put this up on a bike stand two by two

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.570 
put this up on a bike stand two by two
by<00:05:05.310> eight<00:05:05.550> and<00:05:06.000> I<00:05:06.750> love<00:05:06.990> that<00:05:07.310> they<00:05:08.310> didn't<00:05:08.520> go

by eight and I love that they didn't go

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.120 
by eight and I love that they didn't go
three<00:05:08.820> gears<00:05:09.060> here<00:05:09.450> I<00:05:09.770> think<00:05:10.770> it's<00:05:10.860> a<00:05:10.920> twenty

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
three gears here I think it's a twenty

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.000 
three gears here I think it's a twenty
