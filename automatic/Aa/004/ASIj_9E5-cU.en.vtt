00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.769 
can see he hasn't looked at his main
base<00:00:25.260> for<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.560> really<00:00:25.830> long<00:00:25.859> time<00:00:26.750> which<00:00:27.750> is

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
base for a really long time which is

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.080 
base for a really long time which is
something<00:00:28.080> he's<00:00:28.769> just<00:00:28.949> not<00:00:29.220> Mac<00:00:29.460> rowing<00:00:29.789> as<00:00:29.939> he

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
something he's just not Mac rowing as he

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.810

should<00:00:30.410> yeah<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:31.740> can't<00:00:32.460> really<00:00:32.579> be

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
should yeah and I can't really be

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.000 
should yeah and I can't really be
flashing<00:00:33.090> got<00:00:33.540> very<00:00:34.320> well<00:00:34.559> but<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.860> looked

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
flashing got very well but it looked

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.370 
flashing got very well but it looked
like<00:00:35.130> it's<00:00:35.309> in<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.910> four<00:00:36.300> digit<00:00:36.660> range<00:00:37.079> which

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
like it's in the four digit range which

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.400 
like it's in the four digit range which
is<00:00:37.500> probably<00:00:37.739> not<00:00:38.010> where<00:00:38.219> he<00:00:38.399> wants<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.670> be

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
is probably not where he wants to be

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.510 
is probably not where he wants to be
yeah<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.500> looks<00:00:40.680> like<00:00:40.770> his<00:00:40.920> minerals<00:00:41.370> are

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
yeah it looks like his minerals are

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.979 
yeah it looks like his minerals are
pretty<00:00:41.730> high<00:00:41.910> as<00:00:42.059> well<00:00:42.500> and<00:00:43.500> that's<00:00:43.800> he<00:00:44.730> just

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
pretty high as well and that's he just

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.990 
pretty high as well and that's he just
he<00:00:45.989> just<00:00:46.020> not<00:00:46.500> how<00:00:46.620> many<00:00:46.680> many<00:00:46.920> units<00:00:47.309> even

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
he just not how many many units even

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.369 
he just not how many many units even
though<00:00:48.059> he's<00:00:48.210> got<00:00:48.360> such<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.629> big<00:00:48.780> advantage<00:00:49.110> and

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
though he's got such a big advantage and

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.569 
though he's got such a big advantage and
you<00:00:49.469> can<00:00:49.590> see<00:00:49.710> he's<00:00:49.829> forced<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.250> lift<00:00:50.460> his

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
you can see he's forced to lift his

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.670 
you can see he's forced to lift his
command<00:00:50.879> sent<00:00:51.090> her<00:00:51.180> away<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.629> he<00:00:52.379> is<00:00:52.469> running

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
command sent her away and he is running

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.260 
command sent her away and he is running
away<00:00:52.860> right<00:00:53.129> now<00:00:53.570> yeah<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:55.579> could<00:00:56.579> go<00:00:56.789> battle

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
away right now yeah I could go battle

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.750 
away right now yeah I could go battle
cruiser<00:00:57.480> or<00:00:57.600> something<00:00:57.989> because<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.500> mean<00:00:59.340> he

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
cruiser or something because I mean he

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.639 
cruiser or something because I mean he
has<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.390> much<00:01:00.660> money<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.079> make<00:01:01.350> battle

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
has that much money to make battle

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:02.990 
has that much money to make battle
cruisers<00:01:01.920> but<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.190> mean<00:01:02.430> he<00:01:02.579> just<00:01:02.609> lost<00:01:02.879> his

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
cruisers but I mean he just lost his

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.149 
cruisers but I mean he just lost his
fourth<00:01:03.270> expansion<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:03.930> think<00:01:04.350> his<00:01:04.409> main<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.860> not

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
fourth expansion I think his main is not

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.570 
fourth expansion I think his main is not
or<00:01:05.400> both<00:01:05.610> mind<00:01:06.360> out<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.810> at<00:01:07.770> this<00:01:07.920> point<00:01:08.159> he

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
or both mind out and at this point he

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.120 
or both mind out and at this point he
needs<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.970> start<00:01:09.180> doing<00:01:09.630> something<00:01:10.130> other

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
needs to start doing something other

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.679 
needs to start doing something other
than<00:01:11.430> just<00:01:11.610> sitting<00:01:11.790> around<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.270> defending

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
than just sitting around and defending

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.230 
than just sitting around and defending
its<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:13.020> don't<00:01:13.170> attack<00:01:13.729> yeah<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.760> think<00:01:14.970> at

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
its you don't attack yeah I think at

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.330 
its you don't attack yeah I think at
this<00:01:15.390> point<00:01:15.509> Jaedong<00:01:16.380> has<00:01:16.710> really<00:01:17.159> turned

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
this point Jaedong has really turned

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.050 
this point Jaedong has really turned
this<00:01:17.490> game<00:01:17.610> around<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:19.350> think<00:01:20.040> our<00:01:20.670> flash

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
this game around and I think our flash

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.530 
this game around and I think our flash
has<00:01:21.420> pretty<00:01:21.780> much<00:01:22.020> lost<00:01:22.409> his<00:01:22.770> advantage<00:01:23.540> he

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
has pretty much lost his advantage he

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.929 
has pretty much lost his advantage he
had<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.720> really<00:01:25.380> outstanding<00:01:25.700> advantage<00:01:26.700> from

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
had a really outstanding advantage from

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.990 
had a really outstanding advantage from
that<00:01:27.119> five<00:01:27.390> barracks<00:01:27.840> push<00:01:28.140> but<00:01:28.890> he<00:01:29.729> hasn't

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
that five barracks push but he hasn't

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.940 
that five barracks push but he hasn't
been<00:01:30.060> back<00:01:30.119> rowing<00:01:30.450> as<00:01:30.689> well<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.619> can<00:01:31.650> see

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
been back rowing as well and you can see

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.390 
been back rowing as well and you can see
that<00:01:31.979> like<00:01:32.369> his<00:01:33.350> experience<00:01:34.350> isn't<00:01:34.560> as<00:01:34.770> isn't

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
that like his experience isn't as isn't

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.640 
that like his experience isn't as isn't
enough<00:01:35.700> he's<00:01:36.540> got<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.780> experience<00:01:37.200> but<00:01:37.619> it's

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
enough he's got the experience but it's

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.230 
enough he's got the experience but it's
not<00:01:37.979> as<00:01:38.100> much<00:01:38.220> as<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.549> others<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.119> can

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
not as much as the others and you can

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.600 
not as much as the others and you can
see<00:01:39.390> his<00:01:39.570> late-game<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:40.170> not<00:01:40.350> as<00:01:40.530> good<00:01:40.740> as<00:01:40.950> I'm

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
see his late-game is not as good as I'm

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.980 
see his late-game is not as good as I'm
some<00:01:41.820> other<00:01:41.970> players<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:43.020> might<00:01:43.170> see<00:01:43.470> today

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
some other players you might see today

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.780 
some other players you might see today
yeah<00:01:45.990> but<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.200> wouldn't<00:01:46.500> say<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.619> he<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.700> going

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
yeah but I wouldn't say that he is going

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.280 
yeah but I wouldn't say that he is going
to<00:01:47.909> be<00:01:47.970> taken<00:01:48.329> picking<00:01:48.869> up<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.049> fourth

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
to be taken picking up the fourth

down<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.210> very<00:02:00.630> good<00:02:00.780> flash<00:02:01.140> but<00:02:01.439> oh<00:02:01.640> so<00:02:02.640> close

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
down to very good flash but oh so close

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.170 
down to very good flash but oh so close
oh<00:02:03.119> jeez<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:05.189> can<00:02:05.490> only<00:02:05.579> see<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:06.000> it

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
oh jeez that I can only see that it

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.600 
oh jeez that I can only see that it
looks<00:02:06.210> like<00:02:06.540> it's<00:02:06.780> 60<00:02:07.380> health<00:02:07.619> which<00:02:08.429> is

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
looks like it's 60 health which is

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.139 
looks like it's 60 health which is
really<00:02:08.910> disappointing

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
really disappointing

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.500 
really disappointing
for<00:02:10.509> flash<00:02:10.780> because<00:02:11.280> taking<00:02:12.280> that<00:02:12.430> out<00:02:12.640> would

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
for flash because taking that out would

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.750 
for flash because taking that out would
have<00:02:13.840> probably<00:02:14.110> even<00:02:14.319> up<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.680> game<00:02:14.860> again<00:02:15.159> but

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
have probably even up the game again but

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.210 
have probably even up the game again but
flash<00:02:16.420> I<00:02:16.900> don't<00:02:17.530> know<00:02:17.620> he<00:02:17.769> looks<00:02:17.950> kind<00:02:18.189> of

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
flash I don't know he looks kind of

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.550 
flash I don't know he looks kind of
worried<00:02:18.549> because<00:02:18.790> he's<00:02:19.629> not<00:02:20.140> in<00:02:20.260> a<00:02:20.319> very<00:02:20.439> good

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
worried because he's not in a very good

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.059 
worried because he's not in a very good
position<00:02:20.709> in<00:02:21.250> a<00:02:21.730> very<00:02:21.909> good<00:02:22.090> position<00:02:22.269> anymore

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
position in a very good position anymore

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.649 
position in a very good position anymore
yeah<00:02:24.069> I<00:02:24.099> know<00:02:24.250> definitely<00:02:25.209> a<00:02:25.239> clash<00:02:25.450> in<00:02:25.599> the

yeah I know definitely a clash in the
late<00:02:25.840> game<00:02:26.140> is<00:02:26.170> not<00:02:26.590> good<00:02:26.950> early<00:02:27.670> game<00:02:27.849> as<00:02:28.030> we

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
late game is not good early game as we

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.830 
late game is not good early game as we
thought<00:02:28.359> Great<00:02:28.629> Plague<00:02:28.900> right<00:02:29.079> there<00:02:29.609> and

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840

flash<00:02:33.700> really<00:02:34.000> needs<00:02:34.180> to<00:02:34.299> improve<00:02:34.480> his

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:34.659 
flash really needs to improve his

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.300 
flash really needs to improve his
late-game<00:02:34.840> it's<00:02:35.140> good<00:02:35.379> but<00:02:35.650> it's<00:02:35.709> not<00:02:36.040> good

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
late-game it's good but it's not good

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.250 
late-game it's good but it's not good
enough<00:02:36.370> to<00:02:36.730> match<00:02:36.879> the<00:02:37.030> likes<00:02:37.239> of<00:02:37.390> jaedong<00:02:37.750> he

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
enough to match the likes of jaedong he

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.170 
enough to match the likes of jaedong he
you<00:02:38.500> can<00:02:38.620> see<00:02:38.829> in<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.159> early<00:02:39.670> games<00:02:39.909> he<00:02:40.090> was

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
you can see in the early games he was

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.660 
you can see in the early games he was
just<00:02:40.299> doing<00:02:40.420> such<00:02:40.810> a<00:02:40.840> good<00:02:41.049> job<00:02:41.109> of<00:02:41.890> pressuring

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
just doing such a good job of pressuring

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.059 
just doing such a good job of pressuring
jaedong<00:02:43.109> keeping<00:02:44.109> those<00:02:44.200> expansions<00:02:44.680> down

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
jaedong keeping those expansions down

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.899 
jaedong keeping those expansions down
but<00:02:45.670> as<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.299> game<00:02:46.329> progressed<00:02:46.930> he<00:02:47.170> just

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:47.909 
but as the game progressed he just

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:50.129 
but as the game progressed he just
stopped<00:02:48.909> making<00:02:49.269> units<00:02:49.569> all<00:02:49.690> together<00:02:49.810> it

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
coming in lots of units oh there wasn't

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.150 
coming in lots of units oh there wasn't
that<00:04:34.810> many<00:04:35.020> units<00:04:35.320> but<00:04:35.530> they<00:04:35.680> did<00:04:35.860> a<00:04:35.890> lot<00:04:36.130> of

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
that many units but they did a lot of

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.860 
that many units but they did a lot of
damage<00:04:36.430> anyways<00:04:36.970> and<00:04:37.180> you<00:04:37.270> can<00:04:37.630> see<00:04:37.750> this

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
damage anyways and you can see this

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.930 
damage anyways and you can see this
expansion<00:04:38.230> is<00:04:38.410> being<00:04:38.620> forced<00:04:38.980> to<00:04:39.130> evacuate<00:04:39.370> as

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
expansion is being forced to evacuate as

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.170 
expansion is being forced to evacuate as
well<00:04:41.100> yeah<00:04:42.100> and<00:04:42.250> at<00:04:42.370> this<00:04:42.490> point<00:04:42.669> that<00:04:42.820> was<00:04:43.090> a

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
well yeah and at this point that was a

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.330 
well yeah and at this point that was a
really<00:04:43.510> really<00:04:43.750> bad<00:04:44.020> thing<00:04:44.919> for<00:04:44.950> flash

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
really really bad thing for flash

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.490 
really really bad thing for flash
because<00:04:45.550> he's<00:04:45.730> locked<00:04:46.090> up<00:04:46.419> one<00:04:47.140> of<00:04:47.260> the<00:04:47.380> only

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
because he's locked up one of the only

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.680 
because he's locked up one of the only
mine<00:04:47.830> expansions<00:04:48.430> left<00:04:48.610> and<00:04:48.820> all<00:04:49.270> these<00:04:49.419> fire

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
mine expansions left and all these fire

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.930 
mine expansions left and all these fire
and<00:04:50.110> my<00:04:50.410> Ratan<00:04:50.770> don't<00:04:51.010> do<00:04:51.160> any<00:04:51.400> damage<00:04:51.760> to

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
and my Ratan don't do any damage to

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.620 
and my Ratan don't do any damage to
ultra<00:04:52.390> so<00:04:52.720> it's<00:04:53.380> definitely<00:04:53.770> a<00:04:53.940> really<00:04:54.940> bad

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
ultra so it's definitely a really bad

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.710 
ultra so it's definitely a really bad
unit<00:04:55.960> choice<00:04:56.290> there<00:04:56.530> i<00:04:56.740> I<00:04:57.700> really<00:04:58.060> don't<00:04:58.390> agree

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
unit choice there i I really don't agree

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.870 
unit choice there i I really don't agree
with<00:04:58.810> his<00:04:59.050> unit<00:04:59.290> choice<00:04:59.470> to<00:04:59.650> go<00:04:59.770> fire<00:05:00.669> backs

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
with his unit choice to go fire backs

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.610 
with his unit choice to go fire backs
and<00:05:01.000> if<00:05:01.090> he<00:05:01.180> just<00:05:01.390> looked<00:05:01.630> none<00:05:02.470> of<00:05:02.560> his

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
and if he just looked none of his

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.590 
and if he just looked none of his
barracks<00:05:03.010> were<00:05:03.130> flashing<00:05:03.610> again<00:05:03.760> which<00:05:04.570> is

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
barracks were flashing again which is

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.080 
barracks were flashing again which is
really<00:05:04.750> just<00:05:05.200> another<00:05:05.380> thing<00:05:05.800> on<00:05:06.040> flash<00:05:06.760> needs

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
really just another thing on flash needs

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.030 
really just another thing on flash needs
to<00:05:07.180> improve<00:05:07.419> on<00:05:07.600> he<00:05:08.230> did<00:05:08.380> play<00:05:08.500> very<00:05:08.770> well<00:05:08.830> this

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
to improve on he did play very well this

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.409 
to improve on he did play very well this
game<00:05:09.190> you<00:05:09.370> can<00:05:09.490> see<00:05:09.669> he<00:05:09.850> just<00:05:09.880> has<00:05:10.210> an

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
game you can see he just has an

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.280 
game you can see he just has an
excellent<00:05:11.350> early<00:05:12.070> game<00:05:12.250> but<00:05:12.550> his<00:05:13.479> late<00:05:14.110> game

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
excellent early game but his late game

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.870 
excellent early game but his late game
is<00:05:14.320> lacking<00:05:14.650> just<00:05:15.010> a<00:05:15.070> little<00:05:15.280> bit<00:05:15.400> and<00:05:15.520> more

may be able to get that expansion off

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:21.279 
may be able to get that expansion off
over<00:06:19.370> there<00:06:19.490> but<00:06:20.029> even<00:06:20.210> these<00:06:20.599> ultras<00:06:21.020> you<00:06:21.169> can

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:21.289 
over there but even these ultras you can

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:23.050 
over there but even these ultras you can
see<00:06:21.439> that<00:06:21.469> ultrasone<00:06:22.129> a<00:06:22.159> hold<00:06:22.520> position<00:06:22.909> but

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:23.060 
see that ultrasone a hold position but

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.239 
see that ultrasone a hold position but
it<00:06:23.150> took<00:06:23.270> so<00:06:23.479> many<00:06:23.569> shots<00:06:23.870> I<00:06:24.199> think<00:06:25.159> the

00:06:25.239 --> 00:06:25.249 
it took so many shots I think the

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:26.980 
it took so many shots I think the
calculation<00:06:25.879> for<00:06:26.090> a<00:06:26.120> fully<00:06:26.419> upgraded

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:26.990 
calculation for a fully upgraded

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.350 
calculation for a fully upgraded
ultralisk<00:06:27.800> was<00:06:28.460> a<00:06:28.490> couple<00:06:28.819> of<00:06:28.879> hundred<00:06:29.150> hits

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
ultralisk was a couple of hundred hits

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.019 
ultralisk was a couple of hundred hits
from<00:06:29.749> Murray<00:06:30.110> instant<00:06:30.740> to<00:06:31.039> be<00:06:31.129> killed<00:06:31.400> which

00:06:32.019 --> 00:06:32.029 
from Murray instant to be killed which

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:34.659 
from Murray instant to be killed which
is<00:06:32.180> really<00:06:32.360> amazing<00:06:32.830> yeah<00:06:33.830> the<00:06:34.069> poly<00:06:34.249> upgraded

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:34.669 
is really amazing yeah the poly upgraded

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:37.390 
is really amazing yeah the poly upgraded
ultimate<00:06:35.029> can<00:06:35.270> take<00:06:35.479> like<00:06:36.199> a<00:06:36.259> hundred<00:06:36.620> over<00:06:37.370> a

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:37.400 
ultimate can take like a hundred over a

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.869 
ultimate can take like a hundred over a
hundred<00:06:37.819> thumb<00:06:38.569> range<00:06:38.960> shot<00:06:39.199> so<00:06:39.879> definitely

00:06:40.869 --> 00:06:40.879 
hundred thumb range shot so definitely

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:43.239 
hundred thumb range shot so definitely

00:06:58.899 --> 00:06:58.909 
like it will be the last battle because

00:06:58.909 --> 00:07:01.869 
like it will be the last battle because
there's<00:06:59.180> no<00:06:59.599> units<00:07:00.050> here<00:07:00.169> to<00:07:00.289> defend<00:07:00.439> for<00:07:00.879> the

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:03.289 
flash and flash is going to lose the

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:06.429

rest<00:07:03.409> of<00:07:03.589> his<00:07:03.650> space<00:07:04.330> yeah<00:07:05.330> in<00:07:05.539> my<00:07:05.569> opinion<00:07:06.020> for

00:07:06.429 --> 00:07:06.439 
rest of his space yeah in my opinion for

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:08.649 
rest of his space yeah in my opinion for
this<00:07:06.560> game<00:07:06.889> flash<00:07:07.819> probably<00:07:08.270> could<00:07:08.479> have<00:07:08.509> done

00:07:08.649 --> 00:07:08.659 
this game flash probably could have done

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:10.689 
this game flash probably could have done
well<00:07:09.080> by<00:07:09.319> using<00:07:09.770> you<00:07:10.069> either<00:07:10.370> eating
