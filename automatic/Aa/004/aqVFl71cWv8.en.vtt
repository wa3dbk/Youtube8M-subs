00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:05.350
 we had spoken neither well nor 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:08.769
 well we got on this topic 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.270
 it's not something that surprises me that does not 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:12.850
 we want with the campus that we are 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:16.150
 because I was very clear with you the 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.830
 first day that the basis of what 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.690
 us from the campus that I was going to face 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.680
 this semester was the one that was 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:25.470
 training 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.150
 already with the teacher upon my arrival 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.910
 it always gave me a margin of 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.920
 possibilities that could arise 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.870
 as to 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.870
 to strengthen our team 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.910
 We were looking at the alternatives that 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.910
 offered us the market and we believe that 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.950
 of no era 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.950
 Enough 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.660
 is good enough to overcome 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.790
 and what we have in these 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.220
 moments in the psyche's plan 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.730
 and I insist it is not something that surprises us 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.250
 that we could not find 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.650
 players that empower our team 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.460
 what speaks 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.440
 from the high level that I think the 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.870
 club lion at the moment in his plante 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.240
 the issue of hiring I take it with 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:24.840
 a vision of empowering the team does not 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:27.030
 I take it by obligation or by myself 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.369
 the fact itself that the 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.710
 book the market of passes and initiates a 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.159
 season and you have to bring players I think 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.799
 that we have a good campus and to bring 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.170
 players have to be of the high level 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.479
 you enter account with this you find 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.709
 with these these setbacks that you 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.450
 I just said out there the price very 

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:48.060
 high out there the player prefers another 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.280
 option out there we did not find a player 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.990
 of the level that we pretend good not what 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.229
 same the same thing that I just said are 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.730
 all possibilities and conjectures that 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.770
 they do without any certainty 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.010
 that we are open we are open in 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.810
 that opening that we have for 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.400
 for 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.430
 and this 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:15.140
 enhance campus enter all 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:17.450
 options logically but it's not a 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.390
 it's not going to be an obligation that I 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.790
 I think the two positions we 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:26.969
 we can 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.969
 I'm empowered by good in the case of 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:34.670
 the defenders as you said 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.709
 we have at this moment the 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.580
 medallion that we can make play of 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.580
 central- a bottinelli 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.040
 to nacho 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.469
 and well there it is 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.700
 the sheet that can play thin that 

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:50.780
 can also play central marker 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.700
 the reality is that the first game 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.519
 nacho is not going to be then we are 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.819
 there a little short in that aspect but 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.819
 good 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.040
 this 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.250
 when playing a game per week we 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.500
 We believe that by making a big effort 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.170
 and with a good recovery 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.420
 weekly hopefully we do not have 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.880
 inconvenient but fundamentally the 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.350
 consideration that we have to enhance 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.290
 that place is precisely why 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.630
 you just said that there are not many left over 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.700
 players in that position and forward 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.390
 the same thing happens 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.240
 this 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.540
 Miguel 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.220
 mauro martÃ­n caicedo who can play 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.180
 above 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.780
 the same riverbank that can play more 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.780
 offensive 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:46.720
 we also believe that it is a position that 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:50.020
 we can look for alternatives, the 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:53.260
 evolution we hope that this week that 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.410
 begins on Monday and is working 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.750
 here with us 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.960
 fieldwork with the teacher with the 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.540
 doctor who attended him and with claudio 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.819
 our kinesiologist and little by little we will go 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.000
 putting what I think 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:12.620
 d 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.620
 being optimistic here 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:19.040
 One month you can get to be with us 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.959
 I have not talked to the doctor of them 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.790
 but from what I 've talked to the 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:27.700
 leaders and with the kinesiologist I calculate 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.700
 that in a month will be available
