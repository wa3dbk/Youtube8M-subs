everybody loves hot chocolate

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.070 
everybody loves hot chocolate
I<00:01:14.159> think<00:01:14.729> everybody<00:01:15.090> does<00:01:15.330> anyway<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.810> know<00:01:15.990> I

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
I think everybody does anyway I know I

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.560 
I think everybody does anyway I know I
do<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.409> love<00:01:16.680> chocolate<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.909> I'm<00:01:18.030> using<00:01:18.060> a

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
do I love chocolate and so I'm using a

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.929 
do I love chocolate and so I'm using a
scooper<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.530> I'm<00:01:19.920> just<00:01:20.100> going<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.400> scoop<00:01:20.759> out

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
scooper and I'm just going to scoop out

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.249 
scooper and I'm just going to scoop out
I<00:01:21.060> don't<00:01:21.270> even<00:01:21.390> want<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.750> tell<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.110> the

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
I don't even want to tell you the

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.080 
I don't even want to tell you the
measurements<00:01:22.830> because<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.369> all<00:01:23.549> depends<00:01:24.000> upon

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
measurements because it all depends upon

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.530 
measurements because it all depends upon
how<00:01:24.450> much<00:01:24.509> how<00:01:25.409> many<00:01:25.470> servings<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.070> want

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
how much how many servings you want

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.120 
how much how many servings you want
clearly<00:01:27.540> this<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.960> lot<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.439> chocolate<00:01:28.650> here

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
clearly this is a lot of chocolate here

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.600 
clearly this is a lot of chocolate here
so<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.759> could<00:01:29.909> probably<00:01:30.710> give<00:01:31.710> hot<00:01:31.920> cocoa<00:01:32.310> for

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
so it could probably give hot cocoa for

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.690 
so it could probably give hot cocoa for
a<00:01:32.640> family<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.240> four<00:01:33.630> on<00:01:33.930> an<00:01:34.350> evening<00:01:34.530> or<00:01:35.159> for

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
a family of four on an evening or for

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.330 
a family of four on an evening or for
one<00:01:35.909> for<00:01:36.360> evenings<00:01:36.689> in<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.900> row<00:01:37.020> whatever<00:01:37.470> you

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
one for evenings in a row whatever you

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.670 
one for evenings in a row whatever you
can<00:01:38.520> make<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.850> little<00:01:39.090> bit<00:01:39.210> smaller<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:40.049> can

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
can make it a little bit smaller you can

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.179 
can make it a little bit smaller you can
