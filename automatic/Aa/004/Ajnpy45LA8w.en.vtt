00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.130
 today a simple tutorial the 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.390
 We'll start it half a good fist 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.450
 in a simple way 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.000
 we take 3 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.900
 and there at the center they can have a marble 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.630
 or they can have 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.790
 something circular in this case 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.400
 also if you do it without anything is 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.980
 possible only remember not to pull or 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.079
 close fingers 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.900
 which are going to make a cut of 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.260
 crossed as you can see it and they are going to 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.089
 take three turns 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.879
 I want to talk a little of something 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:50.200
 this new this new one is from some 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.690
 way 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.450
 decorative because many people 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.960
 they like to make for example keyrings or 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.960
 something 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.109
 the macramÃ© and type cycle but the day of 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.370
 today we are going to see how really this knot 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:09.440
 It can have functions too 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.330
 but good once we have these two 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.970
 we have to place the exactly 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.320
 because they have the same equal fingers 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.420
 way you had to have made a cut 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.870
 crossed and yes but not observing is crossed 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.480
 and finally we started to spin what 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.260
 interesting to go around is that 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.920
 you increase where I was in your 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.450
 fingers and so they will have complete control 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.390
 of the knot and not having 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.799
 a problem that is now let's see 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.350
 how in some way in this precise 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.570
 moment does not appear in a monkey fist for 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.720
 the saved 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.729
 something a little different but good 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.400
 idea is that it asks to move now we are going 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:49.210
 to see a little how to do them but the 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.790
 idea is that they are also made 33 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.100
 turns the number of turns can 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:57.580
 change in fact if for example it's a lot 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.590
 thicker he knows it up to 425 but what 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.960
 ideal is that by the thickness of the rope 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.380
 will limit how many turns should 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.380
 to give it 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:13.450
 finished very loose very 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.970
 a loose then at that precise moment 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:20.060
 to have to take the last string and 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.360
 from the last string will start the one that 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:27.460
 do the pressure if the do well of 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.460
 some way is going to work and not have 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.409
 fifty 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.410
 now so we have to start the 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:37.690
 perfect third round 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.520
 now a circle does not appear 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.860
 and we're going to have to take it from the 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.350
 first and we will make luck because 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.470
 we will follow the rope as one after 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:50.140
 another and always strong when performing this 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.350
 pressure to be the strong one so that for 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.500
 that in the end our fist is perfect 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.410
 love 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.330
 other functions of the fist - is for 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.520
 example if they have to do something strong 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.100
 to load this truck or any 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.900
 thing is always dysfunctional to have a 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.090
 monkey fist because it can help them 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.340
 have a final pressure and that I do not go 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.340
 to let go is always like it's a 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.360
 little ball at the end and that's what 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.210
 it produces somehow 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.100
 a lot of safety when doing the knot I 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.440
 somehow how busy different 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.950
 activities that he had and has been very 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:29.810
 simple to make it many people who 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.810
 they occupy the cold monkey too 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.790
 in the particular I think there are two 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.650
 more beautiful decorative knots and that 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.180
 It has enough functionalities 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.460
 and that one can increase the 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.800
 functionalities but as you know 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.510
 to tie the docks is very good 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.660
 that was his original function and hence 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.730
 this little knot came up that does not have 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.870
 nothing complicated as also in the 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.120
 video 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.700
 once the majority have been pulled 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.040
 well practically with the remains 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.989
 start going down to all all all for 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.170
 so that they remain strong 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.360
 strong position 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.110
 I usually take when you're hopefully 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.450
 the end of the rope so that for 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:15.110
 really be at the end of the rope the 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:17.660
 that becomes strong not because 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.090
 I would take case I take another part of the 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.160
 which had to cut another piece the 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.710
 Monkey fist is usually applied in 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.960
 the corners of the strings but not 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.270
 there is no problem in occupying it 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.530
 center of an agreement for example if 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.990
 you would like to make a rope of 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.690
 rescue with many points of the world 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:38.419
 it would be very good because it is perfectly 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:41.000
 scalable and so the people who have not 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:43.490
 spare you would practically do it very 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.139
 well but let's say what for the time 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:49.160
 to do rescue, if it's a bit 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:52.780
 complicated but good I guess that 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.780
 It is precisely all video 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:05:00.040
 I hope you like it and you already know 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:03.670
 subscribe if they have any relationship or 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.170
 anything you know, they ask me here 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.820
 the minutes 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:09.490
 good always ends up being a very knot 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.800
 resistant this knot in some way to 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.650
 be resistant have many varieties 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.540
 which you can apply and how 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.580
 in my case good condition 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:22.870
 you must find the best ones for you 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:27.250
 but good are mountain climbers do not work 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:29.880
 a lot and if they are also so try to 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.880
 to do a lot 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.340
 the comments have some new 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.400
 only the opposite 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.400
 ah
