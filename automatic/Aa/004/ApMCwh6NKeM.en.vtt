00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.750
 I am not at all concerned with 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.190
 diets I tried but no if I have 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.490
 do a diet I will not eat the 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.530
 day 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.410
 I can stay a whole day without 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.430
 eat I try to make food from 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.279
 from time to time because I have 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.460
 children but I teach them to do at 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.210
 to eat so that for him to face the 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.119
 dinner at night 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.220
 at my age yes I so I try a little 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.930
 to avoid the cream 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.050
 some organic products according to the 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.490
 price here but now and then I get 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:42.850
 let go but good 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:44.140
 a few vegetables some compotes 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.380
 not what I do not trust too much 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.090
 to pesticides on fruits no I 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.300
 average what for me eat 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:55.150
 balanced is rather a balance to 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.290
 find on the day because does not have 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.950
 always have time to eat at each 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:02.610
 meal a crudity meat vegetables and 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:06.820
 so it's morning I'll try to 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.620
 morning it's pretty important so from 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.700
 fruit juice if possible squeeze if 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.350
 I have time otherwise 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.659
 for my daughter who has a lot of appetite 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.119
 right now cereals toast 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.880
 milk so there is almost everything when 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:23.570
 even in the breakfast is then 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.909
 on the day at noon me it's a little 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.909
 fast often and my daughter is at school 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.380
 so it's not always very good and not 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.689
 always very balanced so we catch up 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.460
 a little on the evening trying to do 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:39.040
 a vegetable meal 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.299
 it's also cereals and time in 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.040
 time of meat or fish but 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.320
 not every day I know it takes 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.450
 eat five fruits and vegetables a day 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.509
 good game I do not care I do it 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.880
 not really so finally here I eat at 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.350
 the canteen every day is not very 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.470
 good is in all the canteens 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.500
 the same 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:01.460
 other than that I do not care I eat 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.780
 fries burgers all that so no I 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.360
 do not pay attention to my mode 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.860
 feeding especially I know this 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.000
 that it's the mc but I do not care 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.210
 I 'm not happy at all 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.670
 watch out and usually I eat eat 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.990
 the outside my mother she gives me 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.730
 money to buy something or 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.800
 so m2 in a sandwich and I eat 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.900
 not the canteen I do not like it we say 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.400
 often I do not starch it does 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.470
 to magnify that chocolate is not good 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.280
 that butter and cream it 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.020
 must be avoided 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.300
 good after I'm not particularly 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.800
 convinced by all that 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.720
 in the job that I do especially he 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.880
 must I arrive at the balanced 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.680
 because we eat a lot outside 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.300
 and not always at good times so 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.190
 So I'm trying to think about 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.470
 my diet and his team on a 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.670
 week when I abused for two 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.270
 days I 'm very careful both 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.270
 following days
