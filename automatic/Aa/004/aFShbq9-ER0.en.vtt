00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.550
 the final started with an interesting 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.770
 fight between jonathan castellanos juan 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.380
 marcos angelini and emiliano spataro los 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.660
 three in little difference trying the 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.750
 overreached scared elaborated a 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.880
 straight walkway and when getting on par 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.779
 Angelini opened it hit him and pulled him out of 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.779
 track the lanús pilot 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:30.509
 Angelini address miss 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.290
 by the mirror to be king without a doubt that 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.290
 be it not only the wheel 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:44.020
 and up front it's not that he supported me 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:49.450
 or that it took me to gain radio gave me 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:51.250
 but one day it was going to happen until it happened 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.140
 we are going to analyze maneuvers that the 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:57.540
 expert to pay close attention to me 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.540
 likes like says scared 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.400
 and once I give the reason to mauro page 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.050
 unfortunately and from own experience 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.240
 of all the reason in the floor that had the 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.130
 hand nothing either for so many 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.840
 inconsistencies for one that wins that and 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.840
 Manuel also does not throw paper 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:28.080
 because the shadow either 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:29.820
 first I'm tired I was right 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.140
 you were well beyond that there 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.640
 said I say incoherence had say 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.259
 several and that is inconsistencies 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.940
 I say this because some older people 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.100
 he is happy he studies that well because 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.840
 if you stayed angelini the truth that if 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:51.659
 goes inside but I could stay 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:53.220
 because the triangle are different 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.690
 I had to criticize in the super 8 is and 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.069
 medium but the only problem that there was 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.270
 here is that it gives me right in the wheel 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:59.250
 front and I get the big time 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.240
 hands without mediating the point nothing happens 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.240
 I have the clue 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:28.560
 so in the direction of the triangle and 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.510
 later when he came down the forest street 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.730
 in voices something that is the time to 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.680
 doubt that it is nothing but these moments of 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.790
 travel until until I mail 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.120
 although the beat train comes 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.720
 silva was swerving or did not see it not me 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.030
 it seems that you want if you want you want 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.270
 open obviously it's like you want it 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:51.660
 of a quiet estate it is good to know that 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.730
 I 'm corrective corrective, it was 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.910
 power for what Emiliano says 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.200
 they hit the front wheel and and they took him out 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.940
 now there was only the entrance to the pits 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.070
 boat and you will be left with reasons and the 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.590
 pasture and ended badly in the jungle 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.450
 for inside but it's a blow that 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.490
 let's say nothing should have happened 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.600
 just because he hit nothing 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.250
 the address and just in the part 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.170
 front of the wheel later the 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.420
 hands that on the pontoon nothing happens is 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.700
 a good bird who doubles nothing else does not pass 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.810
 nothing 11 I do not know if to say of the evils of 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.370
 Argentine autonomy that we have 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.920
 different commissioners because we have 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.600
 different audits the etc and I think 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.820
 that here I do not know whether to applaud but there 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.350
 that to be saying that it's okay is 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.750
 penalizing this coming 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.510
 let's say well in the one of pernía with maxi 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.430
 Juan and this change of also talking 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.600
 the meeting of the entity be quiet loves the 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.780
 pilot meeting they said they do not know 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.000
 could speak or be the pilots in this 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.160
 I am in favor of the pilots have to 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.720
 know these things inside the etc and 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.730
 after the super 8 of the currents to 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.730
 me that a vale everything has changed 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.660
 the white line that is in the 7 c that 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.700
 it should not be violated in the ages or if not 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.770
 it was not more to see to see now but now 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.260
 listen, see what the duck is silva the 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.760
 duck silva workshop had a nothing do not serve 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.070
 as because fewer meters traveled in the 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.480
 final an opening maneuver but what 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.860
 penalized first let's see the 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.860
 maneuver and we ask the pastoral 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:43.590
 first I tried to pass to the gurí although 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.050
 I knew that regulations could not be 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.470
 and the guru is like he told me not to pass 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.470
 because they sanction you 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.480
 then this one did not want to be in that 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.890
 situation the reality is that everything 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.660
 start because I did not want to stay in that 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.420
 situation of being an arbitrator in the 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.460
 career definition and obviously 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.500
 that is the gray because the formula1 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.300
 allows that maneuver of formula-1 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.310
 allows the laggards to recover the 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.830
 turn and the whole Indian line is in 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.780
 some time I think I will have taken as 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:19.170
 misunderstood or I did not have the 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:22.020
 sure that you could but before the 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:24.600
 situation I said I try and good I did 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.700
 the procedure was to enter the boxes to go to 60 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.590
 kilometers per hour and recover the 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.020
 back because when the race ended 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.480
 the commissioners called me they told me 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:37.520
 explain the situation they told me I do not know 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.520
 it can be good there is not much more
