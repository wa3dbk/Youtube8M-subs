of September seventh nineteen ninety
eight<00:01:56.120> cuz<00:01:56.660> that<00:01:56.810> detector<00:01:57.260> is<00:01:57.440> looks

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
eight cuz that detector is looks

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.590 
eight cuz that detector is looks
different<00:01:58.670> than<00:01:58.730> the<00:01:59.000> rest<00:01:59.180> of<00:01:59.300> them<00:01:59.450> that

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
different than the rest of them that

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.450 
different than the rest of them that
were<00:01:59.690> checked<00:01:59.960> her<00:02:00.110> up<00:02:00.230> nice<00:02:00.470> so<00:02:01.220> it<00:02:01.310> looks

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
were checked her up nice so it looks

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.860 
were checked her up nice so it looks
like<00:02:01.550> that<00:02:01.760> one<00:02:01.940> just<00:02:02.120> didn't<00:02:02.390> get<00:02:02.480> upgraded

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
like that one just didn't get upgraded

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.590 
like that one just didn't get upgraded
good<00:02:03.590> to<00:02:03.680> know<00:02:03.710> that's<00:02:04.250> a<00:02:04.520> concern<00:02:04.880> for<00:02:04.910> Angie

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
good to know that's a concern for Angie

good to know that's a concern for Angie
as<00:02:05.750> this<00:02:06.140> is<00:02:06.380> her<00:02:06.620> child's<00:02:07.130> room<00:02:07.340> I've<00:02:07.790> learned

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
as this is her child's room I've learned

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.520 
as this is her child's room I've learned
that<00:02:08.210> if<00:02:08.300> you<00:02:08.540> just<00:02:08.750> replace<00:02:09.020> the<00:02:09.080> batteries

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
that if you just replace the batteries

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.880 
that if you just replace the batteries
that's<00:02:09.770> not<00:02:10.009> enough<00:02:10.340> sometimes<00:02:10.790> the<00:02:11.210> actual

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
that's not enough sometimes the actual

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.770 
that's not enough sometimes the actual
hardware<00:02:12.890> is<00:02:13.040> actually<00:02:13.520> faulty<00:02:13.940> or<00:02:14.150> expired

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
hardware is actually faulty or expired

the fire crew found two additional smoke

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.800 
the fire crew found two additional smoke
detectors<00:02:17.360> also<00:02:17.930> manufactured<00:02:18.620> in<00:02:19.120> 1998<00:02:20.120> this

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
detectors also manufactured in 1998 this

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.810 
detectors also manufactured in 1998 this
one<00:02:21.020> in<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.200> hallway<00:02:21.380> is<00:02:21.770> functioning<00:02:22.430> but<00:02:22.730> in

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
one in the hallway is functioning but in

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.730 
one in the hallway is functioning but in
the<00:02:22.910> master<00:02:23.240> bedroom<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:23.780> connector<00:02:24.290> appears

the master bedroom the connector appears

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.640 
the master bedroom the connector appears
weak<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.790> NFPA<00:02:26.330> recommends<00:02:26.930> that<00:02:26.959> all<00:02:27.200> smoke

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
weak the NFPA recommends that all smoke

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.760 
weak the NFPA recommends that all smoke
detectors<00:02:28.160> be<00:02:28.340> replaced<00:02:28.820> after<00:02:29.060> ten<00:02:29.630> years

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
detectors be replaced after ten years

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.170 
detectors be replaced after ten years
you<00:02:30.770> feel<00:02:30.980> like<00:02:31.100> you're<00:02:31.160> safe<00:02:31.459> you<00:02:31.640> have<00:02:31.790> smoke

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
you feel like you're safe you have smoke

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.820 
you feel like you're safe you have smoke
detectors<00:02:32.209> you<00:02:32.780> change<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:33.170> batteries<00:02:33.530> but

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
detectors you change the batteries but

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.190 
detectors you change the batteries but
clearly<00:02:34.640> that's<00:02:34.940> not<00:02:35.090> enough<00:02:35.450> and<00:02:35.690> Eugene

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
clearly that's not enough and Eugene

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.890

detectors<00:02:42.350> have<00:02:42.500> lithium<00:02:42.709> batteries<00:02:43.400> those

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
detectors have lithium batteries those

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.340 
detectors have lithium batteries those
are<00:02:43.910> good<00:02:43.940> for<00:02:44.180> ten<00:02:44.360> years<00:02:44.630> but<00:02:44.959> firefighters

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
are good for ten years but firefighters

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.470 
are good for ten years but firefighters
still<00:02:45.680> recommend<00:02:46.340> you<00:02:46.550> test<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:47.000> alarm<00:02:47.300> at

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
still recommend you test the alarm at

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.890 
still recommend you test the alarm at
least<00:02:47.840> every<00:02:48.110> six<00:02:48.350> months
