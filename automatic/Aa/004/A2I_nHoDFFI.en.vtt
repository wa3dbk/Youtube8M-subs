YouTube sunfire glass and he alerted me
that<00:00:33.320> there<00:00:33.590> was<00:00:33.620> another<00:00:33.950> channel<00:00:34.430> sheep<00:00:35.300> in

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
that there was another channel sheep in

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:36.880 
that there was another channel sheep in
a<00:00:35.510> rowboat<00:00:35.870> and<00:00:36.020> you<00:00:36.320> were<00:00:36.440> having<00:00:36.739> problems

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
a rowboat and you were having problems

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.010 
a rowboat and you were having problems
with<00:00:37.399> colors<00:00:37.820> and<00:00:38.230> you're<00:00:39.230> working<00:00:39.410> on<00:00:41.020> here's

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
with colors and you're working on here's

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.959 
with colors and you're working on here's
that<00:00:42.260> here's<00:00:42.620> the<00:00:42.829> real<00:00:43.040> kicker<00:00:43.340> there<00:00:43.790> are

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
that here's the real kicker there are

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:50.470 
that here's the real kicker there are
several<00:00:44.780> types<00:00:45.170> of<00:00:45.410> glass<00:00:45.710> out<00:00:45.980> there<00:00:48.339> my<00:00:49.480> best

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
several types of glass out there my best

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.049 
several types of glass out there my best
guess<00:00:50.949> because<00:00:51.949> I<00:00:52.100> looked<00:00:52.280> up<00:00:52.429> I<00:00:52.789> tried

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
guess because I looked up I tried

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:54.520 
guess because I looked up I tried
looking<00:00:53.390> on<00:00:53.539> google<00:00:53.690> for<00:00:53.899> the<00:00:54.079> trade<00:00:54.320> name

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
looking on google for the trade name

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.500 
looking on google for the trade name
that<00:00:55.309> you<00:00:55.399> mentioned<00:00:55.879> in<00:00:55.969> your<00:00:55.999> video<00:00:56.359> and<00:00:56.390> I

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
that you mentioned in your video and I

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.509 
that you mentioned in your video and I
couldn't<00:00:56.839> find<00:00:57.019> that<00:00:57.260> actual<00:00:57.620> company<00:00:58.039> my

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
couldn't find that actual company my

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:00.549 
couldn't find that actual company my
guess<00:00:58.760> is<00:00:58.969> that<00:00:58.999> they're<00:00:59.359> a<00:00:59.629> read<00:00:59.989> distributor

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
guess is that they're a read distributor

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.319 
guess is that they're a read distributor
for<00:01:00.739> one<00:01:00.920> of<00:01:01.039> two<00:01:01.070> types<00:01:01.550> of<00:01:01.789> glass<00:01:02.030> either

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
for one of two types of glass either

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.930 
for one of two types of glass either
bullseye<00:01:02.989> which<00:01:03.859> is<00:01:03.980> used<00:01:04.129> primarily<00:01:04.250> and

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
bullseye which is used primarily and

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.080 
bullseye which is used primarily and
slumping<00:01:05.449> and<00:01:05.630> fusing<00:01:06.050> or<00:01:06.610> more<00:01:07.610> ready<00:01:07.790> rod

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
slumping and fusing or more ready rod

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.210 
slumping and fusing or more ready rod
which<00:01:08.420> is<00:01:08.720> my<00:01:09.050> guess<00:01:09.290> I'm<00:01:09.530> guessing<00:01:10.100> that's

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
which is my guess I'm guessing that's

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.420 
which is my guess I'm guessing that's
what<00:01:10.460> you've<00:01:10.610> got<00:01:10.690> it<00:01:11.690> is<00:01:11.930> so<00:01:12.400> important<00:01:13.400> to

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
what you've got it is so important to

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.010 
what you've got it is so important to
understand<00:01:13.820> that<00:01:13.940> colors<00:01:14.360> work<00:01:14.750> on<00:01:14.990> a

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
understand that colors work on a

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.400 
understand that colors work on a
principle<00:01:15.380> of<00:01:15.770> capturing<00:01:17.410> microscopic

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
principle of capturing microscopic

particles of precious metals almost in

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.100 
particles of precious metals almost in
when<00:01:22.850> I<00:01:22.880> say<00:01:23.180> precious<00:01:23.510> metals<00:01:23.780> I<00:01:23.810> don't<00:01:23.990> mean

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
when I say precious metals I don't mean

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.930 
when I say precious metals I don't mean
just<00:01:24.140> gold<00:01:24.650> and<00:01:24.710> silver<00:01:25.130> yes<00:01:25.340> they're<00:01:25.580> used<00:01:25.790> to

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
just gold and silver yes they're used to

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.810 
just gold and silver yes they're used to
but<00:01:26.840> capturing<00:01:27.380> heavy<00:01:27.950> metals<00:01:28.340> and<00:01:28.490> precious

within<00:01:45.620> the<00:01:45.860> glass<00:01:46.070> that<00:01:46.340> will<00:01:46.430> cause<00:01:46.610> it<00:01:46.820> to

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
within the glass that will cause it to

within the glass that will cause it to
boil<00:01:47.180> or<00:01:49.300> you<00:01:50.300> can<00:01:50.510> actually<00:01:50.900> have<00:01:51.050> some

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
boil or you can actually have some

right out of the rod very easily when it
happens<00:02:02.720> you<00:02:03.080> can<00:02:03.350> when<00:02:03.620> it<00:02:03.710> gets<00:02:03.890> really

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
happens you can when it gets really

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.160 
happens you can when it gets really
advanced<00:02:04.820> you<00:02:04.910> can<00:02:05.060> actually<00:02:05.240> watch<00:02:05.720> it<00:02:05.750> right

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170

that<00:02:27.840> you<00:02:28.020> learn<00:02:28.230> neutral<00:02:28.910> oxidizing<00:02:29.910> and

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
that you learn neutral oxidizing and

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.170 
that you learn neutral oxidizing and
reducing<00:02:30.200> you<00:02:31.200> know<00:02:31.319> too<00:02:31.380> much<00:02:31.770> oxygen<00:02:32.490> too

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
reducing you know too much oxygen too

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.120 
reducing you know too much oxygen too
much<00:02:33.390> propane<00:02:34.459> because<00:02:35.990> the<00:02:36.990> mix<00:02:37.319> is<00:02:37.620> critical

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
much propane because the mix is critical

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.470 
much propane because the mix is critical
and<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.370> other<00:02:38.520> thing<00:02:38.580> is<00:02:38.760> critical<00:02:39.240> is<00:02:39.300> how

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
and the other thing is critical is how

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.580 
and the other thing is critical is how
far<00:02:39.840> out<00:02:40.020> in<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.260> fire<00:02:40.620> you<00:02:41.550> hold<00:02:41.820> the<00:02:41.970> glass

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
far out in the fire you hold the glass

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.520 
far out in the fire you hold the glass
obviously<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.709> closer<00:02:43.980> you<00:02:44.310> bring<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:45.270> rod

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
obviously the closer you bring the rod

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.050 
obviously the closer you bring the rod
towards<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.650> torch<00:02:46.950> you<00:02:47.310> get<00:02:47.520> closer<00:02:47.910> and

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
towards the torch you get closer and

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.610 
towards the torch you get closer and
closer<00:02:48.270> to<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.540> hot<00:02:48.780> zone<00:02:48.810> right<00:02:49.320> where<00:02:49.530> the

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
closer to the hot zone right where the

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.540 
closer to the hot zone right where the
cones<00:02:49.860> are<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:51.560> that'll<00:02:52.560> work<00:02:52.709> fast<00:02:53.100> but<00:02:53.400> that

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
cones are and that'll work fast but that

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.820 
cones are and that'll work fast but that
will<00:02:53.700> burn<00:02:53.910> your<00:02:54.120> colors<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:54.930> nothing<00:02:55.560> like

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
will burn your colors to nothing like

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.290 
will burn your colors to nothing like
just<00:02:56.310> boom<00:02:57.060> so<00:02:57.840> first<00:02:58.650> thing<00:02:59.010> keep<00:02:59.550> it<00:02:59.760> farther

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
just boom so first thing keep it farther

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.530 
just boom so first thing keep it farther
out<00:03:00.630> in<00:03:01.100> the<00:03:02.100> fire<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.610> be<00:03:02.910> willing<00:03:03.090> to<00:03:03.269> work<00:03:03.390> a

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
out in the fire and be willing to work a

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.810 
out in the fire and be willing to work a
little<00:03:03.570> slower<00:03:05.720> if<00:03:06.720> I<00:03:06.989> have<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:07.800> color<00:03:08.670> that's

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
little slower if I have a color that's

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.509 
little slower if I have a color that's
just<00:03:09.390> been<00:03:09.840> problematic<00:03:10.500> now<00:03:10.830> you<00:03:10.890> can<00:03:11.310> see

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
just been problematic now you can see

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.180 
just been problematic now you can see
this<00:03:11.700> color<00:03:12.540> obviously<00:03:12.900> is<00:03:13.560> not<00:03:13.709> what<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.040> raw

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
this color obviously is not what the raw

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.259 
this color obviously is not what the raw
rob<00:03:14.550> was<00:03:14.820> in<00:03:15.120> this<00:03:15.750> case<00:03:16.050> I<00:03:16.470> actually<00:03:17.430> wanted

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
rob was in this case I actually wanted

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.790 
rob was in this case I actually wanted
that<00:03:18.480> this<00:03:18.720> is<00:03:18.870> called<00:03:19.050> a<00:03:19.140> striking<00:03:19.620> color

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
that this is called a striking color

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.190 
that this is called a striking color
which<00:03:20.100> is<00:03:20.340> I<00:03:20.730> doubt<00:03:20.940> you<00:03:21.390> have<00:03:21.600> a<00:03:21.660> striking

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
which is I doubt you have a striking

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.320 
which is I doubt you have a striking
color<00:03:22.380> but<00:03:22.560> it's<00:03:22.680> possible<00:03:23.190> striking<00:03:23.970> colors

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
color but it's possible striking colors

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.780 
color but it's possible striking colors
change<00:03:24.959> as<00:03:25.380> you<00:03:25.440> work<00:03:25.890> them<00:03:26.100> in<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.310> fire<00:03:26.519> and

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
change as you work them in the fire and

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.360 
change as you work them in the fire and
then<00:03:27.299> by<00:03:27.540> keeping<00:03:28.049> them<00:03:28.200> in<00:03:28.320> an<00:03:28.440> oxidizing<00:03:29.280> or

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
then by keeping them in an oxidizing or

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.259 
then by keeping them in an oxidizing or

reducing atmosphere and special kiln

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.740 
reducing atmosphere and special kiln
cycles<00:03:33.780> you<00:03:33.870> can<00:03:34.019> make<00:03:34.170> them<00:03:34.320> change<00:03:34.650> to

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
cycles you can make them change to

infinite<00:03:36.750> colors<00:03:37.170> really<00:03:37.519> this<00:03:38.519> is<00:03:38.700> an<00:03:38.790> exotic

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
infinite colors really this is an exotic

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.170 
infinite colors really this is an exotic
blue<00:03:39.650> it<00:03:40.650> comes<00:03:40.950> in<00:03:41.130> this<00:03:41.280> dark<00:03:41.549> color<00:03:41.820> here

blue it comes in this dark color here

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.979 
blue it comes in this dark color here
and<00:03:42.209> then<00:03:43.170> as<00:03:44.060> you<00:03:45.060> work<00:03:45.239> it<00:03:45.390> in<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:45.570> fire<00:03:45.780> you

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
and then as you work it in the fire you

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.720 
and then as you work it in the fire you
get<00:03:46.170> everything<00:03:46.380> from<00:03:46.769> mirror<00:03:47.340> finish

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
get everything from mirror finish

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.500 
get everything from mirror finish
Silver's<00:03:48.420> to<00:03:49.190> light<00:03:50.190> blues<00:03:50.610> and<00:03:51.060> emerald

Silver's to light blues and emerald

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.600 
Silver's to light blues and emerald
colors<00:03:51.959> right<00:03:52.230> down<00:03:52.470> to<00:03:52.680> almost<00:03:52.829> a<00:03:53.100> pale<00:03:53.340> white

colors right down to almost a pale white

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.090 
colors right down to almost a pale white
because<00:03:54.030> there's<00:03:54.299> tons<00:03:54.900> of<00:03:55.260> metallic<00:03:55.860> silver

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
because there's tons of metallic silver

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.430 
because there's tons of metallic silver
in<00:03:56.340> this<00:03:56.519> rod<00:03:56.760> and<00:03:57.120> it's<00:03:57.510> literally<00:03:57.780> fuming

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
in this rod and it's literally fuming

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.990

off<00:03:58.620> silver<00:03:59.040> as<00:03:59.190> you're<00:03:59.340> working<00:03:59.430> it's<00:03:59.820> kind

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
off silver as you're working it's kind

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.640 
off silver as you're working it's kind
of<00:04:00.030> cool<00:04:00.239> what<00:04:00.930> I<00:04:00.959> was<00:04:01.110> saying<00:04:01.320> is<00:04:01.410> if<00:04:01.530> you<00:04:01.620> have

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
of cool what I was saying is if you have

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.229 
of cool what I was saying is if you have
a<00:04:01.739> color<00:04:01.980> that<00:04:02.190> you<00:04:02.310> don't<00:04:02.610> want<00:04:02.850> to<00:04:03.030> change

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
a color that you don't want to change

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:04.789 
a color that you don't want to change
even<00:04:03.510> it's<00:04:03.690> like<00:04:04.019> this<00:04:04.200> strike<00:04:04.470> and<00:04:04.620> color

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
even it's like this strike and color

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.860 
even it's like this strike and color
would<00:04:04.950> be<00:04:04.980> a<00:04:05.070> good<00:04:05.250> example<00:04:05.370> case<00:04:06.360> it<00:04:06.630> take<00:04:06.840> a

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
would be a good example case it take a

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.319 
would be a good example case it take a
piece<00:04:07.140> of<00:04:07.170> clear<00:04:07.530> rod<00:04:07.739> and<00:04:08.040> just<00:04:08.670> run<00:04:08.910> stripes

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
piece of clear rod and just run stripes

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:12.860 
piece of clear rod and just run stripes
around<00:04:09.570> it<00:04:09.959> so<00:04:10.560> that<00:04:10.709> it's<00:04:10.860> cased<00:04:11.160> and<00:04:11.870> then

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
around it so that it's cased and then

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.900 
around it so that it's cased and then
when<00:04:13.410> you<00:04:13.530> melt<00:04:13.769> that<00:04:14.040> and<00:04:14.280> pull<00:04:14.519> that<00:04:14.700> into

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
when you melt that and pull that into

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.900 
when you melt that and pull that into
your<00:04:15.060> stringers<00:04:15.890> you<00:04:16.890> will<00:04:17.430> already<00:04:17.640> have

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
your stringers you will already have

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.909 
your stringers you will already have
cased<00:04:18.329> it<00:04:18.570> with<00:04:18.720> clear<00:04:19.049> and<00:04:19.289> then<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:19.709> color

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
cased it with clear and then the color

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.029 
cased it with clear and then the color
won't<00:04:20.130> burn<00:04:20.430> out<00:04:21.060> on<00:04:21.539> the<00:04:21.780> torch<00:04:22.049> as<00:04:22.229> badly<00:04:22.650> I

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
won't burn out on the torch as badly I

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.210 
won't burn out on the torch as badly I
mean<00:04:23.490> you<00:04:24.030> can<00:04:24.150> still<00:04:24.210> do<00:04:24.539> it<00:04:24.590> you<00:04:25.590> get<00:04:25.770> it<00:04:25.950> hot

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
mean you can still do it you get it hot

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.190 
mean you can still do it you get it hot
enough<00:04:26.250> and<00:04:26.760> just<00:04:27.000> about<00:04:27.450> any<00:04:27.660> color<00:04:27.960> and

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
enough and just about any color and
