far<00:01:53.670> as<00:01:53.759> I'm<00:01:53.850> concerned<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.659> one<00:01:54.869> problem<00:01:55.079> is

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
far as I'm concerned the one problem is

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.380 
far as I'm concerned the one problem is
is<00:01:56.009> with<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.310> almond<00:01:56.700> meal<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.119> flax

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
is with the almond meal and the flax

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.870 
is with the almond meal and the flax
meal<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.869> volume<00:01:58.229> it's<00:01:58.829> pretty<00:01:59.460> high<00:01:59.850> in

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
meal that volume it's pretty high in

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.870

calories

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
calories

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.219 
calories
I<00:02:00.969> think<00:02:01.240> one<00:02:01.420> of<00:02:01.450> these<00:02:01.600> I<00:02:01.750> think<00:02:01.780> it<00:02:02.020> ends<00:02:02.110> up

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
I think one of these I think it ends up

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:03.929 
I think one of these I think it ends up
turning<00:02:02.409> out<00:02:02.619> to<00:02:02.680> have<00:02:02.890> like<00:02:03.039> 400<00:02:03.280> calories<00:02:03.820> in

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
turning out to have like 400 calories in

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:05.190 
turning out to have like 400 calories in
for<00:02:04.119> something<00:02:04.299> that's<00:02:04.659> this<00:02:04.780> little<00:02:04.960> high<00:02:05.140> in

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
for something that's this little high in

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.620 
for something that's this little high in
calories<00:02:05.759> these<00:02:06.759> are<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:07.000> smaller<00:02:07.299> end<00:02:07.509> of

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
calories these are the smaller end of

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.499 
calories these are the smaller end of
month<00:02:07.780> we<00:02:08.200> actually<00:02:08.530> split<00:02:08.800> in<00:02:08.950> half<00:02:09.099> for<00:02:09.369> her

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
month we actually split in half for her

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.270 
month we actually split in half for her
so<00:02:10.509> I<00:02:10.720> pulse<00:02:11.080> I<00:02:11.290> got<00:02:11.440> a<00:02:11.470> solution<00:02:11.739> fat<00:02:12.069> but<00:02:12.190> I'm

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
so I pulse I got a solution fat but I'm

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.699 
so I pulse I got a solution fat but I'm
not<00:02:12.430> telling<00:02:12.640> you<00:02:12.790> that<00:02:12.849> today<00:02:13.530> so<00:02:14.530> that's

it's going to tweak with the lower the

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.830 
it's going to tweak with the lower the
protein<00:03:45.639> content<00:03:45.790> up<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.329> carbohydrate
