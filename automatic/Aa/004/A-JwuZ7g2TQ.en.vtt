00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
okay here we go I want to kind of give

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:03.649 
okay here we go I want to kind of give
you<00:00:02.520> an<00:00:02.610> idea<00:00:02.879> what<00:00:03.000> it<00:00:03.030> looks<00:00:03.240> like<00:00:03.389> on<00:00:03.449> the

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
you an idea what it looks like on the

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.740 
you an idea what it looks like on the
bottom<00:00:03.959> side<00:00:04.310> it's<00:00:05.310> important<00:00:05.940> as<00:00:06.240> you're

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
bottom side it's important as you're

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.230 
bottom side it's important as you're
setting<00:00:07.140> this<00:00:07.259> plane<00:00:07.620> up<00:00:07.890> that<00:00:08.730> you<00:00:08.820> want<00:00:09.030> this

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
setting this plane up that you want this

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.680 
setting this plane up that you want this
as<00:00:09.599> flat<00:00:09.960> as<00:00:10.170> it<00:00:10.200> can<00:00:10.500> be<00:00:10.650> so<00:00:11.300> it's<00:00:12.300> kind<00:00:12.509> of<00:00:12.540> an

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
as flat as it can be so it's kind of an

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.030 
as flat as it can be so it's kind of an
optical<00:00:13.080> illusion<00:00:13.139> if<00:00:13.500> you're<00:00:13.620> looking<00:00:13.830> at<00:00:13.920> it

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
optical illusion if you're looking at it

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.029 
optical illusion if you're looking at it
from<00:00:14.160> this<00:00:14.400> side<00:00:14.730> it<00:00:15.690> almost<00:00:15.929> looks<00:00:16.199> like<00:00:16.260> you

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
from this side it almost looks like you

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.130 
from this side it almost looks like you
want<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.670> tell<00:00:17.970> off<00:00:18.180> this<00:00:18.480> way<00:00:18.720> that's<00:00:18.930> not

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
want it to tell off this way that's not

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.170 
want it to tell off this way that's not
what<00:00:19.230> you<00:00:19.350> want<00:00:19.590> you<00:00:20.220> want<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.580> be<00:00:20.699> flat<00:00:20.970> on

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
what you want you want it to be flat on

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.640 
what you want you want it to be flat on
the<00:00:21.300> bottom<00:00:21.480> because<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.199> flat

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
the bottom because that is a flat

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.730 
the bottom because that is a flat
surface<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.400> as<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.480> can<00:00:24.630> see<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.380> flap

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
surface and as you can see it the flap

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.279 
surface and as you can see it the flap
is<00:00:25.980> pointing<00:00:26.849> down<00:00:27.060> just<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.630> little<00:00:27.869> bit<00:00:28.019> so

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
is pointing down just a little bit so

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.990 
is pointing down just a little bit so
we're<00:00:28.890> going<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.070> take<00:00:29.189> off<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.490> servo<00:00:29.760> horn

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
we're going to take off that servo horn

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.669 
we're going to take off that servo horn
we're<00:00:30.240> going<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.420> tilt<00:00:30.630> this<00:00:30.810> down<00:00:30.869> just<00:00:31.529> a

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
we're going to tilt this down just a

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.549 
we're going to tilt this down just a
little<00:00:31.710> bit<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:33.120> does<00:00:33.329> rest<00:00:33.630> fly<00:00:33.989> now

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
little bit so that it does rest fly now

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.459 
little bit so that it does rest fly now
the<00:00:34.620> other<00:00:34.860> side<00:00:34.920> we've<00:00:35.730> done<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.390> kind<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.320> want

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
the other side we've done I kind of want

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.410 
the other side we've done I kind of want
to<00:00:37.530> show<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.160> we've<00:00:38.940> already<00:00:39.120> done

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
to show that to you we've already done

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.000 
to show that to you we've already done
this<00:00:39.629> side<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.170> can<00:00:40.350> kind<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.590> see<00:00:40.800> the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
this side so you can kind of see the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.060 
this side so you can kind of see the
difference<00:00:42.050> hopefully<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.350> comes<00:00:43.649> out<00:00:43.829> good

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
difference hopefully that comes out good

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.150 
difference hopefully that comes out good
enough<00:00:44.370> but<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:44.610> want<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:44.910> as<00:00:45.270> level<00:00:45.960> as

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
enough but you want it as level as

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.439 
enough but you want it as level as
possible<00:00:47.930> with<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.050> bottom<00:00:49.469> not<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.190> top

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
possible with the bottom not the top

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.700 
possible with the bottom not the top
because<00:00:51.449> as<00:00:51.629> you're<00:00:51.809> flying<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.350> want<00:00:52.530> you

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
because as you're flying you want you

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.830 
because as you're flying you want you
want<00:00:52.860> your<00:00:52.980> plane<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.309> fly<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.579> with<00:00:53.789> no<00:00:54.030> being

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
want your plane to fly it with no being

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.360 
want your plane to fly it with no being
able<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.079> use<00:00:55.230> no<00:00:55.440> stick<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:56.010> want<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.250> to

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
able to use no stick you want it to

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.760 
able to use no stick you want it to
glide<00:00:56.610> all<00:00:56.910> by<00:00:57.090> itself<00:00:57.449> so<00:00:58.260> just<00:00:58.440> keep<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.710> in

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
glide all by itself so just keep that in

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:59.930 
glide all by itself so just keep that in
mind<00:00:58.829> as<00:00:59.100> you're<00:00:59.219> setting<00:00:59.489> up<00:00:59.579> your<00:00:59.609> servo

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
mind as you're setting up your servo

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.029 
mind as you're setting up your servo
horns<00:01:00.350> another<00:01:01.350> thing<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.559> noticed<00:01:01.590> as<00:01:01.920> I

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
horns another thing I noticed as I

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.650 
horns another thing I noticed as I
turned<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.399> over<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:03.300> don't<00:01:03.359> think<00:01:03.629> I

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
turned it over and I don't think I

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.450 
turned it over and I don't think I
pointed<00:01:03.840> out<00:01:04.049> was<00:01:04.290> these<00:01:04.409> little<00:01:04.470> holes<00:01:04.949> now

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
pointed out was these little holes now

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.760 
pointed out was these little holes now
you<00:01:05.549> don't<00:01:05.700> have<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.909> do<00:01:06.119> this<00:01:06.330> but<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.320> do<00:01:07.470> that

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
you don't have to do this but I do that

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.710 
you don't have to do this but I do that
just<00:01:07.799> underneath<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.939> speed<00:01:09.180> controllers

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
just underneath the speed controllers

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.109 
just underneath the speed controllers
kind<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.590> keeps<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.920> bottom<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.909> speed

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
kind of keeps the bottom of the speed

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.539 
kind of keeps the bottom of the speed
controller<00:01:12.479> cool<00:01:12.990> as<00:01:13.290> you're<00:01:13.590> flying<00:01:13.799> if

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
controller cool as you're flying if

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.130 
controller cool as you're flying if
you're<00:01:14.760> doing<00:01:14.909> some<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.390> know<00:01:15.479> good<00:01:15.720> 3d<00:01:15.960> or

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
you're doing some you know good 3d or

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.440 
you're doing some you know good 3d or
whatever<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:16.979> do<00:01:17.040> also<00:01:17.340> have<00:01:17.490> some

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
whatever and I do also have some

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.109 
whatever and I do also have some
wrinkles<00:01:18.840> here<00:01:19.140> as<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.950> start<00:01:20.850> putting<00:01:21.000> the

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
wrinkles here as you start putting the

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.820 
wrinkles here as you start putting the
plane<00:01:21.390> together<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.439> start<00:01:22.500> adding

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
plane together and you start adding

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.980 
plane together and you start adding
weight<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.430> you'll<00:01:23.549> get<00:01:23.729> wrinkles<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.840> it's

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
weight to it you'll get wrinkles so it's

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.570 
weight to it you'll get wrinkles so it's
important<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.409> kind<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.710> go<00:01:25.860> over<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.369> at<00:01:26.460> the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
important to kind of go over it at the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.210 
important to kind of go over it at the
end<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:27.299> probably<00:01:27.570> really<00:01:27.780> see<00:01:27.960> them<00:01:28.049> here<00:01:28.320> go

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
end you probably really see them here go

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.890 
end you probably really see them here go
over<00:01:29.460> them<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.790> guys<00:01:30.390> you're<00:01:30.509> all<00:01:30.659> done

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
over them it the guys you're all done

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.960 
over them it the guys you're all done
with<00:01:31.020> your<00:01:31.049> plane<00:01:31.350> go<00:01:31.590> over<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:31.979> iron<00:01:32.640> all

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
with your plane go over it and iron all

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.499 
with your plane go over it and iron all
those<00:01:33.210> out<00:01:33.509> just<00:01:34.409> spray<00:01:34.590> some<00:01:34.619> adhesive

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
those out just spray some adhesive

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.690 
those out just spray some adhesive
remover<00:01:36.509> over<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.170> top<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.590> plane<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.130> go

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
remover over the top of the plane and go

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.340 
remover over the top of the plane and go
through<00:01:38.939> with<00:01:39.180> your<00:01:39.360> iron<00:01:39.540> on<00:01:39.750> medium<00:01:40.170> heat

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
through with your iron on medium heat

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.200 
through with your iron on medium heat
and<00:01:40.560> kind<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.460> work<00:01:41.610> out<00:01:41.790> some<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.060> these

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
and kind of work out some of these

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.760 
and kind of work out some of these
wrinkles<00:01:42.659> like<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:43.049> one<00:01:43.229> right<00:01:43.320> here<00:01:43.740> and

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
wrinkles like this one right here and

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.370 
wrinkles like this one right here and
and<00:01:44.130> this<00:01:45.119> one<00:01:45.270> right<00:01:45.360> here<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.899> those<00:01:46.200> will

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
and this one right here and those will

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.690 
and this one right here and those will
those<00:01:46.649> will<00:01:46.799> shrink<00:01:47.040> right<00:01:47.220> up<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.579> work

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
those will shrink right up and work

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.510 
those will shrink right up and work
right<00:01:47.909> out<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.360> anyway<00:01:48.990> just<00:01:49.340> that<00:01:50.340> we're

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
right out so anyway just that we're

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.030 
right out so anyway just that we're
gonna<00:01:50.610> start<00:01:50.880> putting<00:01:51.060> some<00:01:51.270> fins<00:01:51.540> on<00:01:51.960> the

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
gonna start putting some fins on the

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.649 
gonna start putting some fins on the
sides<00:01:53.040> right<00:01:53.280> here<00:01:53.340> kind<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:53.970> helps<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.270> stay

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
sides right here kind of helps it stay

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.959 
sides right here kind of helps it stay
flight<00:01:55.040> level<00:01:56.040> flight<00:01:56.280> in<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.610> air<00:01:56.729> we're

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
flight level flight in the air we're

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.120 
flight level flight in the air we're
going<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.149> do<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.390> next<00:01:57.890> after<00:01:58.890> we<00:01:58.950> get<00:01:59.009> the

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
going to do that next after we get the

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.789 
going to do that next after we get the
servos<00:01:59.430> all<00:01:59.579> adjusted<00:02:00.030> so<00:02:00.270> as<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.409> can<00:02:01.590> see

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
servos all adjusted so as you can see

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.520 
servos all adjusted so as you can see
we've<00:02:01.979> got<00:02:02.159> this<00:02:02.340> done<00:02:03.079> but<00:02:04.079> it's<00:02:04.259> not<00:02:04.380> ready

we've got this done but it's not ready

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.679 
we've got this done but it's not ready
to<00:02:04.680> fly<00:02:04.920> yet<00:02:05.250> we<00:02:05.490> still<00:02:05.670> do<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.030> flaps<00:02:06.299> that's

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
to fly yet we still do the flaps that's

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:07.520 
to fly yet we still do the flaps that's
gonna<00:02:06.780> be<00:02:06.930> our<00:02:06.990> next<00:02:07.110> video

old striker that I use as a reference

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.650 
old striker that I use as a reference
it's<00:02:21.480> just<00:02:21.780> basically<00:02:22.350> a<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.770> wing<00:02:23.069> plane

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
it's just basically a a wing plane

it's just basically a a wing plane
you've<00:02:24.660> probably<00:02:24.840> seen<00:02:25.140> those<00:02:25.290> types<00:02:25.590> before

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
you've probably seen those types before

you've probably seen those types before
I<00:02:26.670> just<00:02:27.270> always<00:02:27.569> before<00:02:28.020> I<00:02:28.050> ever<00:02:28.230> fly<00:02:28.470> an

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
go out of the air up the flaps go up

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.050 
go out of the air up the flaps go up
elevator<00:02:39.450> down<00:02:39.870> flaps<00:02:40.620> go<00:02:40.890> down<00:02:41.100> when<00:02:41.820> you<00:02:41.850> do

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
elevator down flaps go down when you do

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.060 
elevator down flaps go down when you do
your<00:02:42.269> right<00:02:42.480> aileron<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:43.500> want<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.769> make<00:02:43.890> sure

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.860 
your right aileron you want to make sure
that<00:02:44.280> your<00:02:44.430> right<00:02:44.670> aileron<00:02:45.120> comes<00:02:45.390> up<00:02:45.540> first

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
that your right aileron comes up first

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.550 
that your right aileron comes up first
and<00:02:46.350> that<00:02:47.160> your<00:02:47.280> left<00:02:47.550> either<00:02:47.730> on<00:02:48.000> goes<00:02:48.239> down

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
and that your left either on goes down

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.140 
and that your left either on goes down
and<00:02:49.560> these<00:02:49.709> aren't<00:02:49.950> really<00:02:50.100> ailerons<00:02:50.730> this

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
and these aren't really ailerons this

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.699 
and these aren't really ailerons this
what<00:02:51.570> what<00:02:51.930> we<00:02:52.080> call<00:02:52.319> them<00:02:52.470> but<00:02:52.620> they're

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
what what we call them but they're

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.650 
what what we call them but they're
actually<00:02:52.860> Evelyn's<00:02:53.519> because<00:02:53.819> they're<00:02:54.030> an

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
actually Evelyn's because they're an

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.100 
actually Evelyn's because they're an
elevator<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.500> a<00:02:55.970> flap<00:02:56.970> at<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.269> same<00:02:57.510> time<00:02:57.810> but

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
elevator and a flap at the same time but

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.020 
elevator and a flap at the same time but
you<00:02:58.350> know<00:02:58.590> if<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.739> winks<00:02:59.069> perspective

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
you know if the winks perspective

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.330 
you know if the winks perspective
they're<00:03:00.150> called<00:03:00.390> in<00:03:00.510> Elavon<00:03:00.959> so<00:03:01.319> but<00:03:02.160> just

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
they're called in Elavon so but just

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.400 
they're called in Elavon so but just
make<00:03:02.489> sure<00:03:02.519> that<00:03:02.730> you<00:03:03.209> know<00:03:03.330> like<00:03:03.569> I<00:03:03.660> said<00:03:03.720> when

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
make sure that you know like I said when

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.400 
make sure that you know like I said when
you<00:03:04.500> go<00:03:04.620> left<00:03:04.920> aileron<00:03:05.269> or<00:03:06.269> left<00:03:06.510> Elavon<00:03:07.080> you

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
you go left aileron or left Elavon you

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.630 
you go left aileron or left Elavon you
want<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:07.650> make<00:03:07.769> sure<00:03:07.920> that<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.220> left<00:03:08.459> one

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
want to make sure that the left one

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.870 
want to make sure that the left one
comes<00:03:08.850> up<00:03:09.000> first<00:03:09.269> the<00:03:10.140> right<00:03:10.350> one<00:03:10.530> goes<00:03:10.739> down

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
comes up first the right one goes down

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.130 
comes up first the right one goes down
very<00:03:11.880> important<00:03:12.360> because<00:03:12.450> if<00:03:12.630> you<00:03:12.720> put<00:03:12.900> it<00:03:12.930> in

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
very important because if you put it in

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.780 
very important because if you put it in
the<00:03:13.260> air<00:03:13.440> and<00:03:13.470> it's<00:03:13.980> backwards<00:03:14.190> this<00:03:14.610> could

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
the air and it's backwards this could

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.870 
the air and it's backwards this could
end<00:03:14.940> up<00:03:15.000> coming<00:03:15.299> down<00:03:15.650> prematurely<00:03:16.650> so<00:03:17.549> make

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
end up coming down prematurely so make

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.090 
end up coming down prematurely so make
sure<00:03:17.910> your<00:03:18.209> elevators<00:03:18.630> up<00:03:18.890> elevators<00:03:19.890> down

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
sure your elevators up elevators down

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.580 
sure your elevators up elevators down
left<00:03:20.790> aileron<00:03:21.060> right<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:22.260> other<00:03:22.350> honor

left aileron right the other honor

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.069 
left aileron right the other honor
always<00:03:22.920> check<00:03:23.250> those<00:03:23.430> before<00:03:23.730> you<00:03:23.820> start

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
always check those before you start

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.449 
always check those before you start
blasting<00:03:25.079> now<00:03:25.680> that<00:03:25.829> everything's<00:03:26.160> trimmed

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
blasting now that everything's trimmed

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:27.530 
blasting now that everything's trimmed
up<00:03:26.640> you<00:03:26.760> always<00:03:26.940> want<00:03:27.060> to<00:03:27.090> make<00:03:27.180> sure<00:03:27.269> that

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
up you always want to make sure that

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.520 
up you always want to make sure that
your<00:03:27.660> props<00:03:27.900> are<00:03:28.079> set<00:03:28.260> to<00:03:28.350> the<00:03:28.380> right

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
your props are set to the right

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.979 
your props are set to the right
direction<00:03:28.709> now<00:03:29.310> right<00:03:30.150> now<00:03:30.360> they're<00:03:30.840> both

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
direction now right now they're both

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.170 
direction now right now they're both
thrusting<00:03:31.890> and<00:03:32.040> if<00:03:32.280> you<00:03:32.400> had<00:03:32.579> them<00:03:32.700> backwards

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
thrusting and if you had them backwards

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.810 
thrusting and if you had them backwards
and<00:03:33.540> you<00:03:33.630> can<00:03:33.810> wire<00:03:33.989> up<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.459> you<00:03:35.459> can<00:03:35.640> wire

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
and you can wire up the you can wire

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.759 
and you can wire up the you can wire
them<00:03:36.000> up<00:03:36.090> backwards<00:03:36.329> but<00:03:36.720> you<00:03:37.200> can<00:03:37.380> test<00:03:37.590> it

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
them up backwards but you can test it

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.400 
them up backwards but you can test it
with<00:03:37.890> just<00:03:38.100> a<00:03:38.390> feather<00:03:39.390> brush<00:03:39.750> or<00:03:40.049> a<00:03:40.079> piece<00:03:40.260> of

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
with just a feather brush or a piece of

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.920 
with just a feather brush or a piece of
paper<00:03:40.590> and<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.940> more<00:03:42.120> pressure<00:03:42.390> you<00:03:42.570> put<00:03:42.780> the

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
paper and the more pressure you put the

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.330 
paper and the more pressure you put the
more<00:03:43.079> acidic<00:03:43.290> now<00:03:43.530> if<00:03:43.620> you<00:03:43.709> put<00:03:43.890> pressure<00:03:44.040> on

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
more acidic now if you put pressure on

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.759 
more acidic now if you put pressure on
this<00:03:44.459> side<00:03:44.519> there's<00:03:44.940> nothing<00:03:45.299> there<00:03:45.590> you<00:03:46.590> can

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
this side there's nothing there you can

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.770 
this side there's nothing there you can
wire<00:03:46.950> the<00:03:47.160> motors<00:03:47.459> up<00:03:47.609> backwards<00:03:48.120> so<00:03:48.630> it's

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
wire the motors up backwards so it's

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.349 
wire the motors up backwards so it's
always<00:03:48.900> a<00:03:48.989> good<00:03:49.140> idea<00:03:49.230> to<00:03:49.650> test<00:03:50.160> that<00:03:50.430> I<00:03:50.880> wanted

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
always a good idea to test that I wanted

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:52.670 
always a good idea to test that I wanted
to<00:03:51.450> show<00:03:51.570> you<00:03:51.660> one<00:03:51.840> last<00:03:52.049> thing<00:03:52.230> so<00:03:52.500> you<00:03:52.590> can

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
to show you one last thing so you can

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.740 
to show you one last thing so you can
see<00:03:52.769> how<00:03:52.829> much<00:03:53.010> actual<00:03:54.000> thrust<00:03:54.329> is<00:03:54.480> in<00:03:54.630> this

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
see how much actual thrust is in this

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.670 
see how much actual thrust is in this
airplane<00:03:55.049> it'll<00:03:55.859> hold<00:03:56.040> itself

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
airplane it'll hold itself

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:03.949 
airplane it'll hold itself
I<00:04:00.150> itself

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.820 

batteries<00:04:04.959> were<00:04:05.110> kind<00:04:05.349> of<00:04:05.470> weak<00:04:05.620> because

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
batteries were kind of weak because

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.410 
batteries were kind of weak because
we've<00:04:06.069> been<00:04:06.189> doing<00:04:06.459> all<00:04:06.580> this<00:04:06.730> testing<00:04:07.299> with

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
we've been doing all this testing with

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.330 
we've been doing all this testing with
the<00:04:07.540> batteries<00:04:07.900> on<00:04:08.079> but<00:04:08.769> once<00:04:08.950> it's<00:04:09.099> fully

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
the batteries on but once it's fully

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.309 
the batteries on but once it's fully
charged<00:04:09.819> this<00:04:09.939> thing<00:04:10.180> should<00:04:10.329> fly<00:04:10.599> with<00:04:11.290> no

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
charged this thing should fly with no

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.210 
charged this thing should fly with no
problems<00:04:12.870> next<00:04:13.870> step<00:04:14.140> is<00:04:14.409> we're<00:04:14.769> gonna<00:04:14.829> take

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
problems next step is we're gonna take

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.699 
problems next step is we're gonna take
and<00:04:15.640> make<00:04:16.419> some<00:04:16.600> of<00:04:16.630> these<00:04:16.810> balancing<00:04:17.410> fins

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
and make some of these balancing fins

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.099 
and make some of these balancing fins
and<00:04:18.100> we're<00:04:18.970> gonna<00:04:19.060> create<00:04:19.479> them<00:04:19.720> for<00:04:19.989> this

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
and we're gonna create them for this

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.710 
and we're gonna create them for this
plane<00:04:20.410> here<00:04:20.709> as<00:04:21.190> you<00:04:21.340> can<00:04:21.489> see<00:04:21.669> both<00:04:22.240> my<00:04:22.449> planes

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
plane here as you can see both my planes

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.480 
plane here as you can see both my planes
are<00:04:22.930> pretty<00:04:23.229> similar<00:04:23.530> one's<00:04:24.070> a<00:04:24.160> little<00:04:24.250> bit

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
are pretty similar one's a little bit

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.629 
are pretty similar one's a little bit
bigger<00:04:25.110> this<00:04:26.110> one's<00:04:26.380> a<00:04:26.530> single-engine<00:04:27.220> so

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
bigger this one's a single-engine so

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.330 
bigger this one's a single-engine so
when<00:04:27.760> we<00:04:27.880> just<00:04:27.910> built<00:04:28.330> a<00:04:28.510> dual<00:04:28.720> engine<00:04:29.340> it's

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
when we just built a dual engine it's

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.950 
when we just built a dual engine it's
actually<00:04:30.639> my<00:04:30.760> first<00:04:30.970> dual<00:04:31.270> engine<00:04:31.449> airplane

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
actually my first dual engine airplane

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.159 
actually my first dual engine airplane
so<00:04:32.520> I'm<00:04:33.520> kind<00:04:33.850> of<00:04:33.880> a<00:04:33.970> new<00:04:34.120> one<00:04:34.240> for<00:04:34.449> me<00:04:34.570> so<00:04:34.810> I'm

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
so I'm kind of a new one for me so I'm

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:36.990 
so I'm kind of a new one for me so I'm
gonna<00:04:35.289> take<00:04:35.440> you<00:04:35.560> over<00:04:35.650> here<00:04:35.910> what<00:04:36.910> we're

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
gonna take you over here what we're

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.860 
gonna take you over here what we're
gonna<00:04:37.090> do<00:04:37.330> is<00:04:37.570> just<00:04:37.600> use<00:04:38.050> basically<00:04:38.979> are<00:04:39.870> some

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
gonna do is just use basically are some

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.129 
gonna do is just use basically are some
stickers<00:04:41.289> and<00:04:41.880> some<00:04:42.880> plastic<00:04:43.479> I<00:04:43.630> just<00:04:43.840> got<00:04:43.990> the

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
stickers and some plastic I just got the

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:45.600 
stickers and some plastic I just got the
plastic<00:04:44.650> here<00:04:44.860> I<00:04:44.919> think<00:04:45.130> I<00:04:45.190> got<00:04:45.370> it<00:04:45.490> at

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
plastic here I think I got it at

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.330 
plastic here I think I got it at
Michael's<00:04:46.120> or<00:04:46.419> some<00:04:47.410> hobby<00:04:47.620> store<00:04:48.010> a<00:04:48.039> craft

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
Michael's or some hobby store a craft

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.340 
Michael's or some hobby store a craft
store<00:04:48.430> like<00:04:48.760> that<00:04:48.789> and<00:04:49.300> then<00:04:49.960> just<00:04:50.169> the

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
store like that and then just the

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.879 
store like that and then just the
sticker<00:04:50.680> stuff<00:04:51.070> I<00:04:51.250> got<00:04:51.430> this<00:04:51.639> at<00:04:51.880> Hobby<00:04:52.360> Zone

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
sticker stuff I got this at Hobby Zone

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.210 
sticker stuff I got this at Hobby Zone
looked<00:04:53.889> like<00:04:54.039> it<00:04:54.220> was<00:04:54.690> $2.99<00:04:55.690> so<00:04:56.410> and<00:04:57.070> then

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
looked like it was $2.99 so and then

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.529 
looked like it was $2.99 so and then
we're<00:04:57.310> just<00:04:57.340> gonna<00:04:57.520> basically<00:04:57.789> kind<00:04:58.240> of<00:04:58.330> build

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
we're just gonna basically kind of build

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:01.529 
we're just gonna basically kind of build
it<00:04:58.720> out<00:04:58.870> with<00:04:59.080> a<00:04:59.460> knife<00:05:00.460> and<00:05:00.880> I'll<00:05:01.000> cut<00:05:01.300> it<00:05:01.389> out

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:01.539 
it out with a knife and I'll cut it out

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:03.450 
it out with a knife and I'll cut it out

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
paper and we just cut a template to kind

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.189 
paper and we just cut a template to kind
of<00:05:08.710> match<00:05:09.340> it<00:05:09.550> up<00:05:09.669> on<00:05:10.360> the<00:05:10.479> back<00:05:10.690> side<00:05:10.930> there

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
cut out you just kind of take that over

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.680 
cut out you just kind of take that over
here<00:05:20.130> onto<00:05:21.130> your<00:05:21.220> piece<00:05:21.430> of<00:05:21.460> plastic<00:05:22.060> cut<00:05:22.510> that

here onto your piece of plastic cut that

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.560 
here onto your piece of plastic cut that
out<00:05:22.750> and<00:05:23.310> then<00:05:24.310> I<00:05:24.580> just<00:05:25.000> cut<00:05:25.150> it<00:05:25.270> out<00:05:25.389> with<00:05:25.539> just

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
out and then I just cut it out with just

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.270 
out and then I just cut it out with just
some<00:05:25.870> scissors<00:05:26.260> round<00:05:26.530> of<00:05:26.650> standard<00:05:26.979> scissors

and you got your plastic plate and you

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.250 
and you got your plastic plate and you
just<00:05:29.470> put<00:05:29.650> that<00:05:29.680> here<00:05:30.160> and<00:05:30.720> line<00:05:31.720> that<00:05:31.930> up<00:05:31.960> this

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
just put that here and line that up this

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.930 
just put that here and line that up this
is<00:05:32.320> just<00:05:32.560> a<00:05:32.650> sticky<00:05:32.979> tape<00:05:33.220> and<00:05:33.430> you<00:05:33.550> just<00:05:33.729> stick

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
is just a sticky tape and you just stick

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.839 
is just a sticky tape and you just stick
it<00:05:34.060> to<00:05:34.180> one<00:05:34.360> side<00:05:34.740> and<00:05:35.740> you<00:05:36.130> just<00:05:36.310> cut<00:05:36.580> it<00:05:36.729> and

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:36.849 
it to one side and you just cut it and

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:38.790 
it to one side and you just cut it and
then<00:05:37.449> just<00:05:37.599> reverse<00:05:37.960> and<00:05:38.199> do<00:05:38.289> the<00:05:38.410> same<00:05:38.590> thing

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
then just reverse and do the same thing

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.219 
then just reverse and do the same thing
on<00:05:38.889> the<00:05:38.949> other<00:05:39.010> side<00:05:39.750> and<00:05:40.750> when<00:05:40.930> you're<00:05:41.080> all

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
on the other side and when you're all

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:43.610 
on the other side and when you're all
done<00:05:41.530> it'll<00:05:42.130> look<00:05:42.280> something<00:05:42.490> like<00:05:42.639> this<00:05:43.030> and

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
done it'll look something like this and

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.110 
done it'll look something like this and
then<00:05:44.620> what<00:05:45.039> I've<00:05:45.160> done<00:05:45.400> is<00:05:45.610> cut<00:05:45.849> a<00:05:45.880> little

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
then what I've done is cut a little

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.589 
then what I've done is cut a little
notch<00:05:46.449> out<00:05:47.020> of<00:05:47.199> it<00:05:47.349> for<00:05:47.590> the<00:05:47.680> tape<00:05:47.919> and<00:05:48.599> then

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:49.599 
notch out of it for the tape and then

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:52.710 
notch out of it for the tape and then
once<00:05:50.139> it<00:05:50.289> goes<00:05:50.440> on<00:05:50.620> your<00:05:50.770> airplane<00:05:51.510> it<00:05:52.510> looks

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 
once it goes on your airplane it looks

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.360 
once it goes on your airplane it looks
pretty<00:05:52.990> nice<00:05:53.169> and<00:05:53.500> that<00:05:53.620> little<00:05:53.800> line<00:05:54.099> that

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
pretty nice and that little line that

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:55.640 
pretty nice and that little line that
little<00:05:54.580> hole<00:05:54.699> in<00:05:54.849> there

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
little hole in there

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.719 
little hole in there
well<00:05:56.650> actually<00:05:56.949> where<00:05:57.130> our<00:05:57.159> tape<00:05:57.490> goes

00:05:57.719 --> 00:05:57.729 
well actually where our tape goes

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:00.480 
well actually where our tape goes
through<00:05:57.970> and<00:05:58.389> holds<00:05:58.720> it<00:05:58.780> into<00:05:58.930> place<00:05:59.370> so<00:06:00.370> I'll

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
through and holds it into place so I'll

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:09.970 
hinge tape and onto the bottom part of

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.429 
hinge tape and onto the bottom part of

and then the wings are done and they're

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:17.529 
and then the wings are done and they're
flexible<00:06:15.409> so<00:06:15.860> that<00:06:16.039> it<00:06:16.189> can<00:06:16.369> move<00:06:16.580> so<00:06:17.300> if<00:06:17.419> you

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:17.539 
flexible so that it can move so if you

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:19.149 
flexible so that it can move so if you
do<00:06:17.689> hit<00:06:17.869> somebody<00:06:18.259> in<00:06:18.379> the<00:06:18.469> air<00:06:18.619> and<00:06:18.830> these<00:06:18.979> are

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:19.159 
do hit somebody in the air and these are

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:22.419 
do hit somebody in the air and these are
combat<00:06:19.639> planes<00:06:19.969> we<00:06:20.929> do<00:06:21.110> build<00:06:21.349> these<00:06:21.559> to<00:06:21.889> flex

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:22.429 
combat planes we do build these to flex

00:06:22.429 --> 00:06:25.119 
combat planes we do build these to flex
and<00:06:22.759> and<00:06:22.909> be<00:06:23.539> hit<00:06:23.779> we<00:06:24.019> use<00:06:24.169> that<00:06:24.349> EPP<00:06:24.889> foam

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:25.129 
and and be hit we use that EPP foam

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:28.209 
and and be hit we use that EPP foam
which<00:06:25.399> is<00:06:25.429> pretty<00:06:26.389> flexible<00:06:26.629> foam<00:06:27.199> so<00:06:28.069> that

00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:28.219 
which is pretty flexible foam so that

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:30.489 
which is pretty flexible foam so that
they're<00:06:28.369> nice<00:06:28.699> and<00:06:28.759> durable<00:06:29.209> and<00:06:30.139> that's<00:06:30.349> your
