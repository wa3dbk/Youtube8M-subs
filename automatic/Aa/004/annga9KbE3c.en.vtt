I actually was able to catch the earlier

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.840 
I actually was able to catch the earlier
train<00:00:35.420> because<00:00:35.840> I<00:00:36.470> got<00:00:36.740> to<00:00:37.580> the<00:00:37.670> train<00:00:37.790> station

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
train because I got to the train station

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.540 
train because I got to the train station
really<00:00:38.300> early<00:00:38.890> so<00:00:39.890> I'm<00:00:39.980> off<00:00:40.130> I'm<00:00:40.280> gonna<00:00:40.340> be<00:00:40.520> a

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
really early so I'm off I'm gonna be a

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.260 
really early so I'm off I'm gonna be a
little<00:00:40.670> early<00:00:40.970> and<00:00:41.150> I<00:00:41.360> don't<00:00:41.540> need<00:00:41.660> to<00:00:43.270> hurry

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
little early and I don't need to hurry

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.150 
little early and I don't need to hurry
over<00:00:44.690> to<00:00:44.720> the<00:00:44.930> hotel<00:00:45.350> where<00:00:45.830> we're<00:00:45.980> going<00:00:46.100> to

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
over to the hotel where we're going to

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.280 
over to the hotel where we're going to
check<00:00:46.280> in<00:00:46.460> and<00:00:46.670> I<00:00:47.660> think<00:00:47.720> they<00:00:47.930> said<00:00:48.110> it's

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
check in and I think they said it's

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.460 
check in and I think they said it's
about<00:00:48.470> a<00:00:48.500> mile<00:00:48.770> away<00:00:48.920> so<00:00:49.100> about<00:00:49.820> 26<00:00:50.270> minutes<00:00:50.540> on

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
about a mile away so about 26 minutes on

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.360 
about a mile away so about 26 minutes on
mapquest<00:00:52.250> which<00:00:52.400> is<00:00:52.520> probably<00:00:52.730> a<00:00:54.220> what<00:00:55.220> the

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
mapquest which is probably a what the

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.380 
mapquest which is probably a what the
heck<00:00:55.550> is<00:00:55.760> that<00:00:56.020> Wow<00:00:57.020> anyways<00:00:57.970> twice<00:00:58.970> my<00:00:59.360> phone

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
heck is that Wow anyways twice my phone

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.630 
heck is that Wow anyways twice my phone
is<00:00:59.600> probably

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
is probably

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.729 
is probably
so<00:01:00.820> i<00:01:01.000> think<00:01:01.120> i<00:01:01.210> might<00:01:01.360> just<00:01:01.420> Torgo<00:01:02.110> the<00:01:02.320> taxi

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
so i think i might just Torgo the taxi

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.250 
so i think i might just Torgo the taxi
and<00:01:02.890> go<00:01:03.160> by<00:01:03.760> foot<00:01:04.560> fun<00:01:05.560> stuff<00:01:07.140> for<00:01:08.140> the<00:01:08.229> trip
