then<00:02:28.650> there's<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.160> PL<00:02:29.430> d<00:02:29.610> aka<00:02:30.180> V<00:02:30.390> so<00:02:30.570> flam<00:02:30.870> I'm

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
then there's the PL d aka V so flam I'm

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.560 
then there's the PL d aka V so flam I'm
not<00:02:31.710> sure<00:02:31.860> what<00:02:32.010> PLD<00:02:32.430> stands<00:02:32.670> for<00:02:33.030> but<00:02:33.360> my

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 
have more drone vehicles like the ma V's

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.409 
have more drone vehicles like the ma V's
but<00:06:34.290> accept<00:06:34.830> much<00:06:35.010> better<00:06:35.280> and<00:06:35.580> more<00:06:35.880> for<00:06:36.240> an

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:36.419 
but accept much better and more for an
