00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
buckets when we cut sit around try to

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.480

get better and better and better and

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.109 
get better and better and better and
build<00:01:33.759> and<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:35.500> know<00:01:35.590> I<00:01:35.649> think<00:01:36.009> that<00:01:36.340> on<00:01:37.000> our

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
build and you know I think that on our

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:38.639 
build and you know I think that on our
best<00:01:37.270> basketball<00:01:37.450> with<00:01:38.049> the<00:01:38.080> good<00:01:38.289> news<00:01:38.319> is<00:01:38.560> I

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
best basketball with the good news is I

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:39.809 
best basketball with the good news is I
think<00:01:38.830> he's<00:01:38.920> thrown<00:01:39.100> under<00:01:39.280> level<00:01:39.580> to<00:01:39.640> go<00:01:39.759> to

00:01:39.809 --> 00:01:39.819 
think he's thrown under level to go to

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:41.880 
think he's thrown under level to go to
just<00:01:40.600> see<00:01:40.750> that<00:01:40.869> as<00:01:41.049> soon<00:01:41.289> as<00:01:41.409> I've<00:01:41.530> does<00:01:41.770> the

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
just see that as soon as I've does the

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.300 
just see that as soon as I've does the
court<00:01:42.160> it's<00:01:42.729> positive<00:01:43.149> situations<00:01:44.039> but<00:01:45.039> no

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
court it's positive situations but no

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.669 
court it's positive situations but no
mean<00:01:45.459> coming<00:01:45.610> off<00:01:45.789> the<00:01:45.879> meds<00:01:46.000> i<00:01:46.149> guess<00:01:46.470> if<00:01:47.470> we

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:47.679 
mean coming off the meds i guess if we

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:50.820 
mean coming off the meds i guess if we
figured<00:01:48.310> off<00:01:48.429> to<00:01:48.550> good<00:01:48.700> starts<00:01:49.800> hopefully<00:01:50.800> i

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
figured off to good starts hopefully i

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.240 
figured off to good starts hopefully i
can<00:01:50.920> come<00:01:51.220> in<00:01:51.369> and<00:01:51.550> really<00:01:52.300> increasingly

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
can come in and really increasingly

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.620 
can come in and really increasingly
increase<00:01:54.250> the<00:01:54.399> efficiency

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
increase the efficiency

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.480 
increase the efficiency
best<00:01:56.840> defensive<00:01:57.530> manner<00:01:57.710> we<00:01:57.950> can<00:01:57.979> take<00:01:58.280> our

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
best defensive manner we can take our
