snowed is this map is and I'm pretty

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.810 
snowed is this map is and I'm pretty
there's<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.170> third<00:01:16.439> map<00:01:16.740> I'm<00:01:16.979> sure<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.400> baby's

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
there's a third map I'm sure a baby's

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.289 
there's a third map I'm sure a baby's
hearing<00:01:18.180> map<00:01:18.450> so<00:01:19.490> yeah<00:01:20.490> pretty<00:01:20.759> cool<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.210> you

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
are quite big so you do get to you do

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.340 
are quite big so you do get to you do
get<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.159> run<00:01:26.310> around<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.790> try<00:01:28.009> boogies<00:01:29.009> desert

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
get to run around and try boogies desert

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.170 
get to run around and try boogies desert
cars<00:01:31.350> out<00:01:31.680> there<00:01:31.710> there's<00:01:32.189> choppers<00:01:33.030> out

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
cars out there there's choppers out

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.120 
cars out there there's choppers out
there<00:01:33.420> which<00:01:33.750> are<00:01:33.869> really<00:01:34.170> funky<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.890> drive

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
there which are really funky to drive

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.980 
there which are really funky to drive
again<00:01:35.340> because<00:01:35.700> it's<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.000> same<00:01:36.240> principle

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
again because it's the same principle

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.859 
again because it's the same principle
and<00:01:37.110> same<00:01:37.350> mechanics<00:01:37.860> as<00:01:38.009> d<00:01:38.220> as<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.610> car<00:01:38.869> and

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
and same mechanics as d as the car and

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.300 
and same mechanics as d as the car and
look<00:01:40.170> you've<00:01:40.320> got<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.530> little<00:01:40.680> knife<00:01:40.979> there

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:39.820 
mentioned before i did join the match

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.430 
mentioned before i did join the match
earlier<00:06:40.240> with<00:06:40.630> the<00:06:40.660> developer<00:06:41.200> and<00:06:41.320> there

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 
earlier with the developer and there

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.550 
earlier with the developer and there
were<00:06:41.500> 26<00:06:42.400> players<00:06:42.730> in<00:06:43.030> that<00:06:43.060> map<00:06:43.450> so<00:06:43.780> hopefully

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 
were 26 players in that map so hopefully

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.260 
were 26 players in that map so hopefully
there's<00:06:44.710> gonna<00:06:44.800> be<00:06:45.040> a<00:06:45.070> big<00:06:45.460> maps<00:06:45.700> with<00:06:45.940> lots<00:06:46.120> of

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:46.270 
there's gonna be a big maps with lots of

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:47.610 
there's gonna be a big maps with lots of
players<00:06:46.450> because<00:06:46.900> it<00:06:46.930> gets<00:06:47.140> a<00:06:47.260> little<00:06:47.410> bit

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:47.620 
players because it gets a little bit

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.260 
players because it gets a little bit
boring<00:06:48.040> as<00:06:48.190> the<00:06:48.340> maps<00:06:48.520> are<00:06:48.640> really<00:06:48.910> big<00:06:49.120> it

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.270 
boring as the maps are really big it

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.580 
boring as the maps are really big it
gets<00:06:49.300> a<00:06:49.510> little<00:06:49.660> bit<00:06:49.870> boring<00:06:50.230> if<00:06:50.350> there's<00:06:50.500> not

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:50.590 
gets a little bit boring if there's not

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.950 
gets a little bit boring if there's not
that<00:06:50.650> many<00:06:50.890> place<00:06:51.250> not<00:06:52.150> that<00:06:52.270> many<00:06:52.390> players<00:06:52.720> in
