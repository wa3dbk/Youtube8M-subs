 [music] 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.210
 but 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.710
 I have floating safe in my hands 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.430
 model wobbler Hyde sila from the company Skagen 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.830
 designs 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.000
 originally this wobbler was intended 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:38.070
 for sea fishing in the coastal strip 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.820
 however it turned out that our usual 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.590
 predators on this bait perfectly caught 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.489
 interesting is the fact that in 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.650
 fresh water 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.760
 this floating wobbler turns into 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.730
 clean suspending 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.140
 This is due to the fact that it is salty and 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.570
 fresh water have different density 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:03.600
 Hyde sila has the shape of a narrow body of a fish 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:10.020
 120 millimeters long with this size 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:12.210
 wobbler weighs as much as 20 grams role 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.400
 deepen or have bait plays 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:19.830
 angled moss with characteristic 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:22.140
 notch bait is equipped with three at once 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.260
 firm hooks of a ram with tin 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.260
 coated 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:37.280
 clockwork rings reliable forged Hyde 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.680
 Shelub has a beautiful coloring medium 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.829
 expressive eyes 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.829
 [music] 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.900
 the bait has a load of two 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.090
 weighty balls located in 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.130
 front of the bait these balls 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.100
 movable and when casting 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.620
 are shifted to the very tail bait in 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.720
 As a result, a wobbler flies like a bullet 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.640
 tail forward 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.770
 casting distance contributes to this fact 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.190
 that the wobbler does not have protruding blades 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.880
 which slows the flight on a uniform 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.060
 wiring 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.430
 sideshow has a high frequency finely 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:20.030
 amplitude play with pronounced 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:22.790
 axial rotation of the body in addition 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.850
 the bait balls are pretty quiet 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.120
 but audible sound 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.120

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.349

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:28.379
 [music] 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:31.049
 wobbler Hyde Shila is great for 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:33.569
 fishing in overgrown shallow waters 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.549
 ponds and river shallows of his 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.519
 can be done very quickly and very 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:41.730
 slowly making long pauses and these 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:45.110
 pauses can vary 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.299
 various movements of my bait on 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:51.959

 [music] 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.110

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.319
