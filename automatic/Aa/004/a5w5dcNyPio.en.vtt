00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
at is the v-band clamp itself this thing

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.170 
at is the v-band clamp itself this thing
is<00:01:04.110> super<00:01:04.320> heavy-duty<00:01:04.710> super<00:01:04.860> lightweight<00:01:05.850> it

the non tapered side the side with the
ridge<00:01:36.060> on<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.750> we're<00:01:37.530> gonna<00:01:37.620> put<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.100> in

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
ridge on it and we're gonna put this in

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.860 
ridge on it and we're gonna put this in
through<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.790> port<00:01:39.060> on<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.420> side<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.660> our

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.380 
through the port on the side of our
external<00:01:40.350> wastegate<00:01:40.500> up<00:01:40.920> pipe<00:01:41.130> it's<00:01:41.940> actually

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
external wastegate up pipe it's actually

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.480 
external wastegate up pipe it's actually
a<00:01:42.420> really<00:01:42.690> nice<00:01:43.020> snug<00:01:43.470> fit<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.980> will<00:01:44.100> sit<00:01:44.370> in

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
a really nice snug fit and will sit in

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.680 
a really nice snug fit and will sit in
there<00:01:44.670> by<00:01:44.820> itself<00:01:47.180> next<00:01:48.180> up<00:01:48.330> we're<00:01:48.510> gonna<00:01:48.600> take

there by itself next up we're gonna take

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.130 
there by itself next up we're gonna take
the<00:01:49.230> v-band<00:01:49.710> clamp<00:01:50.100> itself<00:01:50.280> our<00:01:50.820> wrench<00:01:51.780> and

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
the v-band clamp itself our wrench and

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.100 
the v-band clamp itself our wrench and
of<00:01:52.710> course<00:01:53.010> our<00:01:53.250> hex<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.790> we're<00:01:54.600> gonna<00:01:54.720> take

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
of course our hex and we're gonna take

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.290 
of course our hex and we're gonna take
the<00:01:55.470> nut<00:01:55.650> off<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.250> screw<00:01:56.580> so<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:56.880> way<00:01:57.120> the

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.330 
connection between the block off plate
and<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.340> external<00:02:14.760> wastegate<00:02:14.910> pipe<00:02:15.420> itself

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
and the external wastegate pipe itself

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.250 
and the external wastegate pipe itself
now<00:02:17.340> once<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:17.730> get<00:02:17.880> this<00:02:18.030> clamp<00:02:18.420> slept<00:02:18.810> over

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
now once you get this clamp slept over

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.290 
now once you get this clamp slept over
make<00:02:19.500> sure<00:02:19.650> you<00:02:19.740> rotate<00:02:20.280> it<00:02:20.459> so<00:02:20.820> that<00:02:21.000> neither

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
make sure you rotate it so that neither

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.330 
make sure you rotate it so that neither
hinge<00:02:21.810> is<00:02:22.080> gonna<00:02:22.260> interfere<00:02:22.590> between<00:02:23.010> the

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
hinge is gonna interfere between the

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.240 
hinge is gonna interfere between the
flange<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.060> turbo<00:02:24.390> itself<00:02:25.250> simply

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
flange and the turbo itself simply

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.360 
flange and the turbo itself simply
