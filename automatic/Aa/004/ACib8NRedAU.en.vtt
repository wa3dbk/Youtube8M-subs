from<00:03:58.950> someone's<00:03:59.310> perspective<00:03:59.580> that<00:04:00.030> is<00:04:00.150> not

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
from someone's perspective that is not

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
involved in bullet time exactly because

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.530 
involved in bullet time exactly because
I<00:04:02.280> think<00:04:02.340> it's<00:04:02.519> a<00:04:02.549> really<00:04:02.760> cool<00:04:02.940> solution<00:04:03.420> they

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
I think it's a really cool solution they

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.449

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
came up with it in the sight line but

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.370 
came up with it in the sight line but
someone<00:04:05.670> who's<00:04:05.790> not<00:04:06.060> in<00:04:06.330> the<00:04:06.420> sight<00:04:06.630> line<00:04:06.810> side

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
someone who's not in the sight line side

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.020 
someone who's not in the sight line side
line<00:04:07.560> and<00:04:07.590> still<00:04:07.890> watching<00:04:08.370> you<00:04:08.459> are<00:04:08.670> you<00:04:08.820> just

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
line and still watching you are you just

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.699 
line and still watching you are you just
moving<00:04:09.360> really<00:04:09.480> slowly<00:04:09.900> like<00:04:10.260> floating

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
moving really slowly like floating

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.050 
moving really slowly like floating
through<00:04:10.950> the<00:04:10.980> air<00:04:11.100> I<00:04:11.430> would<00:04:11.670> hope<00:04:11.820> not

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
through the air I would hope not

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.490 
through the air I would hope not
yeah<00:04:12.510> it's<00:04:12.660> gonna<00:04:12.780> be<00:04:12.930> interesting<00:04:13.080> to<00:04:13.290> see

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
yeah it's gonna be interesting to see

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.170 
yeah it's gonna be interesting to see
how<00:04:13.590> they<00:04:13.769> do<00:04:13.830> it<00:04:14.130> they're<00:04:14.820> talking<00:04:14.940> about

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
how they do it they're talking about

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.599 
how they do it they're talking about
gang<00:04:15.510> wars<00:04:15.810> and<00:04:16.350> like<00:04:16.890> the<00:04:17.040> different<00:04:17.340> modes

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
gang wars and like the different modes

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.280 
gang wars and like the different modes
and<00:04:17.790> this<00:04:17.970> is<00:04:18.060> I<00:04:18.150> think<00:04:18.209> the<00:04:18.390> gang<00:04:18.570> Ward's<00:04:18.870> gang

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
and this is I think the gang Ward's gang

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.719 
and this is I think the gang Ward's gang
wars<00:04:19.470> is<00:04:19.680> you<00:04:20.160> and<00:04:20.310> a<00:04:20.340> group<00:04:20.489> of<00:04:20.609> your<00:04:20.669> friends
