 bassano a is loaded from this 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.090
 towards a silo 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.310
 3 inside this cell instead we find what the yeast 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.440
 which stored 3 4 and 10 of article 8 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.260
 at the storage warehouse we have pussy licking that shape 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.099
 and through this other wife is transferred to these passions

 kneader works for dough preparation 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.070
 the preparation of the mixture is transferred inside this 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.889
 people 

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:12.939

 in the calibration allows us to define what the thickness of the 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.669
 pasta and then bread 

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:38.749
 subsequently by this machinery 

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:41.749
 invoice passes machinery 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.509
 if training is done 

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:47.539
 of bread through 

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:50.539
 this machine is connected to the leavening chamber 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.949
 in the star cell about 30 

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:56.949
 35 minutes 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.399
 he issuers 

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:04.399
 at the end of the homeland

 fanfani swells in its characteristic drowning form 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.879
 where the operator picks up the chateau 

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:20.589
 balloon and place it in the cooling planes as you can see at 

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:24.149
 my shoulders from these shelves is taken here open 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.569
 so there is a lot at this stage 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.249
 Many workers worked on this phase 

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:36.679
 let's move on to this scalding base 43 

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:40.269
 who is that thing that gives the characteristic name alfano 

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:45.339

 at the end of this phase 

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:59.399
 subsequently it weighs 

00:03:59.399 --> 00:04:02.399
 from weighing it passes to the socket 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.779
 above the grip 

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:09.369
 that crushes the bread and keeps the dishes 

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:11.849
 map then pass 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:14.849
 sure that later 

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:22.869
 from the manual technique to kneading machines a product is prepared with great care 

00:04:22.869 --> 00:04:27.089
