00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:04.490
 After the discovery in 2003 of the largest giant dinosaur in Europe the 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.569
 dinópolis foundation has discovered a new femur of almost two meters of 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:09.269
 length of the river deva 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.309
 it's about the largest of this kind already of neuro peace 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.539
 In the same deposit several remains have been found, which makes it difficult 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:19.069
 know if it is remains of the turiasaurus riodevensis or another animal 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:24.810
 they belonged to it and it turns out that you catch these remains 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.789
 correspond to turia salud fred should 6 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.089
 it would be great news because an unusual way would be completed 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:34.120
 giant dinosaur like nowhere else on the planet 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.980
 but if it turns out that these remains that we are finding here in san lorenzo 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.570
 were not turiasaurus riodevensis the news would be even more important 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.130
 we could say it like that because there were in 2001 different giants 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.940
 in fact 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.270
 within the research team itself 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.940
 there are some paleontologists who would prefer an option that were two 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.360
 giant dinosaurs among other forest speakers preferred emotion that 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.420
 we could definitely complete the skeleton of tuna solutions 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.140
 a right tibia of one meter and 25 centimeters has also been found 15 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.140
 caudal vertebrae because it breaks in hellin to an almost complete 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.570
 also having found ten teeth has been what has indicated that it could 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.100
 be the remains of the turiasaurus riodevensis since they are similar to 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.710
 of this animal 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.550
 for several months only d bones of this dinosaur were found 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.400
 until it was time for the first two teeth to appear and 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.630
 then apparently some more 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.219
 Customers are very similar to the teeth of Turiasaurus riodevensis 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.580
 but they were very close to what is the femur of the hind leg 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.570
 i do not currently 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.830
 no, we can not 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.430
 determine reliably if students belong to the same 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.430
 individual to which the paw bones belong 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.300
 probably yes 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.030
 but at the moment there has been a displacement at least from the head 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.270
 from the opposition that had the head to the position that the 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.590
 legs 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.070
 age and of a major displacement and belong perhaps 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.000
 another type of dinosaur 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.830
 made four the paleontological community counts around the world 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.390
 with very few dinosaur plans and precisely that is also what has been 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.620
 found in the site of san lorenzo what elevates the 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.229
 importance of discovery the key 

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:19.279
 this oksana woman who will try to win in bahrain - ap 

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:22.199
 those dates like that 

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:25.349
 that goes up towards the top, let's say that the teeth 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:26.519
 they would be here 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.730
 would destroy up on top of the plans 

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:36.449
 the interesting stratagem letter that clean it prepare it 

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:41.179
 and will allow us to piggyback 

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:44.149
 see what the morphology of 

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:45.419
 this procedure 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:49.209
 It's very interesting to be able to study it, classify it and compare it with 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.299
 others 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.860
 the turiasaurus with against sediments of Athens and Beijing counts millions 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:59.389
 years and it has been estimated that it weighed around 40 tons and that it would exceed 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:01.050
 the 30 meters in length 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.200
 data that places it as one of the largest dinosaurs on the planet 

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:09.779
 in the river deva area and a total of 52 deposits and so far only 

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:12.619
 they have excavated 5 with important results 

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:15.699
 In addition, the foundation continues to look for more places to follow 

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:16.929
 working 

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:19.549
 117 minute the remains 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.979
 it did not look like he could have this 

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:25.939
 but today already a hundred are a box of surprises we have 52 deposits in this 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:28.659
 municipal term we have excavated in 5 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:32.419
 in the five as it has been excavated we had fantastic surprises 

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:37.089
 we do not know to the other remaining what can be forgiveness any place 

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:40.319
 we have got the peak has come out something unexpected we could not wait 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.329
 find a giant femur with a deposit like this 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.389
 but right now we are treading 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:48.889
 we do the cameras 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:51.889
 we step on it, forgetting that they already feel the future 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:55.699
 a meter below us who knows what now 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:59.129
 the municipality of riodeva is proving very beneficial for the work 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:00.230
 paleontological 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.909
 so the aragon government will begin the execution of a center of 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.849
 interpretation in this place 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:05.769
 who does not 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.209
 today in two or three does not leave the largest dinosaur in the world 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.949
 and that we do not know what we will find when, with the passage of 

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:14.630
 years that your bombs in Baghdad a little 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.190
 We are starting in Teruel to realize that almost doubles the time 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.310
 in almost all analysts the av alike since 2003 I was produced in 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.770
 the year 2003 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.990
 but we have also urged, I think it was a great idea to start 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.990
 only dinopolis and not the foundation that has the scientific backing 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.420
 the police platinum is not just an interpretation center to say the least 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.870
 some way of ludic nature but has behind the back 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.819
 foundation scientist in that aspect there are those who have highlighted 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.780
 Dinópolis territory is nourished by a large scientific base formed by nine 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:51.710
 paleontologists 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.890
 whose field works were found and further investigations and 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:58.030
 publications at national and international level have gone around the 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.150
 world
