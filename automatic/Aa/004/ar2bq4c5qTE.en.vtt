00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:12.260
 Hello my name is Kirill Kyree this 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:15.560
 exposing clean water deducing 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:18.860
 true speaking show mix show in which 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:22.300
 I check the strength of the myths of the 21st century 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.869
 and today we will test the strength 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.840
 chicken eggs 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:31.790
 myth number one will chicken eggs 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:35.590
 endure a man really think not 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.590
 true no it's not true 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.170
 Did you know that eggs are like products ? 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.359
 food has its holiday since 2011 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.210
 every second friday is considered 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:51.089
 holiday eggs the strongest egg in 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.670
 the world is considered an ostrich she is capable 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:56.489
 take up to 115 kilos on stand 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.440
 Does a person's weight is an ordinary chicken egg? 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.670
 various sources say that the usual 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.280
 chicken egg can stand 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.369
 from 2 to 3 kilograms therefore if 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:10.280
 consider that my weight is about 80 85 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.280
 I need a kilo of 5 dozen eggs 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:41.450
 we have 5 dozen and theoretically they 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.590
 can withstand up to one hundred kilos for 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.510
 my weight evenly 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:54.950
 distributed to all these five dozen 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:57.500
 we use a flat surface and the most 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.770
 the biggest egg in the world laid Georgian 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:04.100
 chicken she gave the world an egg weighing 170 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.680
 gram myth number 2 people can't 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.190
 break an egg on an outstretched arm squeezing 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.110
 his palm like it or not can give 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.819
 energy can 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.459
 there under because I know 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.069
 Well, in general, they say that there are no tags twice 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.840
 turned out let's reason logically 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.390
 it is very strange that a girl afterwards 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.819
 He speaks 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.400
 took a chicken egg folded palm over 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.680
 account of vacuum it will not break yes I think 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.880
 can this urartu it's true but i 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.770
 try this sample 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.770
 and you are ready to check it for yourself 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.100
 the internal contents of the egg are located 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.440
 it evenly creates 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.960
 backpressure that's why when we 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.060
 we crush him with a hand we can't 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.280
 break the truth while doing so 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.230
 few rules firstly chicken not 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.060
 there should be no microcracks in 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.890
 second you don't need to put pressure on him 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.270
 as the pressure that will 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.550
 will be on the shell will 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.200
 distributed unevenly by the way if 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.990
 you are worried about how to 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.840
 speak eggs or and testicles then remember 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.990
 Eggs lie in store and in your testicles 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.990
 plans 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:58.250
