00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
hi this is my tutorial on how to make a

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.140 
hi this is my tutorial on how to make a
super<00:00:04.049> clip<00:00:04.850> using<00:00:06.109> cam<00:00:07.109> snaps<00:00:07.970> so<00:00:08.970> the

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
super clip using cam snaps so the

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.000 
super clip using cam snaps so the
equipment<00:00:09.330> that<00:00:09.570> you're<00:00:09.660> going<00:00:09.719> to<00:00:09.929> need<00:00:10.200> is<00:00:10.469> a

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
equipment that you're going to need is a

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.299 
equipment that you're going to need is a
clip<00:00:11.340> so<00:00:12.120> this<00:00:12.389> is<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:13.200> clips<00:00:14.099> that<00:00:14.190> are

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
clip so this is the clips that are

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.450 
clip so this is the clips that are
actually<00:00:14.730> available<00:00:15.830> from<00:00:16.830> cam<00:00:17.130> snaps

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
actually available from cam snaps

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.840 
actually available from cam snaps
they're<00:00:17.940> plastic<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.830> locking<00:00:19.830> clip<00:00:20.300> so

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 
they're plastic the locking clip so

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:29.419 
they're plastic the locking clip so
there<00:00:23.850> you'll<00:00:24.779> need<00:00:25.550> some<00:00:26.550> snaps<00:00:28.099> so<00:00:29.099> here<00:00:29.400> I

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
there you'll need some snaps so here I

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.410 
my all tool and my snap pliers from camp
snaps<00:01:00.170> so<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.230> start<00:01:01.649> out<00:01:01.890> you're<00:01:02.879> going<00:01:03.180> to

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
snaps so to start out you're going to

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.020 
snaps so to start out you're going to
measure<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.439> lengths<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:04.979> our<00:01:07.640> we<00:01:08.640> don't<00:01:08.880> want

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
measure the lengths of our we don't want

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.730 
measure the lengths of our we don't want
the<00:01:09.150> ribbon<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.689> be<00:01:09.900> when<00:01:10.229> it's<00:01:10.380> all<00:01:10.590> completed

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
the ribbon to be when it's all completed

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.500 
the ribbon to be when it's all completed
we<00:01:11.220> don't<00:01:11.400> want<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.790> length<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.299> clip<00:01:12.390> to

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
we don't want the length of the clip to

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.990 
we don't want the length of the clip to
be<00:01:12.720> longer<00:01:13.049> than<00:01:13.140> 8<00:01:13.380> inches<00:01:13.670> for<00:01:14.670> safety

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
be longer than 8 inches for safety

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.210 
be longer than 8 inches for safety
reasons<00:01:16.189> so<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.490> generally<00:01:20.360> cut<00:01:21.710> my<00:01:22.710> ribbon<00:01:23.040> to

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
reasons so I generally cut my ribbon to

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.160 
reasons so I generally cut my ribbon to
10<00:01:23.580> inches<00:01:23.970> there<00:01:24.930> abouts<00:01:26.630> start<00:01:27.630> with<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:28.049> now

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
10 inches there abouts start with so now

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.980 
10 inches there abouts start with so now
I<00:01:28.200> have<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.829> length<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.369> ribbon<00:01:29.880> okay<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:30.689> once

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
I have the length of ribbon okay so once

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.319 
I have the length of ribbon okay so once
we<00:01:31.110> have<00:01:31.229> our<00:01:31.259> lengths<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.650> ribbon<00:01:32.090> cut<00:01:33.090> we

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
we have our lengths of ribbon cut we

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.539 
we have our lengths of ribbon cut we
want<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:34.850> stop<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.090> edges<00:01:36.509> here<00:01:36.720> from<00:01:36.990> fraying

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
want to stop the edges here from fraying

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.660 
want to stop the edges here from fraying
so<00:01:38.549> these<00:01:38.700> fit<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.210> do<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:39.780> just<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.670> cut

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
so these fit to do that is just to cut

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.819 
so these fit to do that is just to cut
any<00:01:41.909> strings<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.689> are<00:01:42.840> they're<00:01:43.079> very<00:01:44.000> close

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:57.940 

and<00:01:49.829> then<00:01:50.130> just<00:01:50.340> take<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.549> break<00:01:50.850> inner<00:01:51.060> lighter

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.350 

on<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.130> edge<00:01:59.250> until<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.850> can<00:01:59.969> see<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.149> edge

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
on the edge until you can see the edge

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.230 
on the edge until you can see the edge
start<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.750> curl<00:02:00.990> up<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.759> that's<00:02:02.759> gonna<00:02:02.969> seal

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
start to curl up and that's gonna seal

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
start to curl up and that's gonna seal
that

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
that

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.590 
that
so<00:02:05.010> then<00:02:05.160> it<00:02:05.250> doesn't<00:02:05.580> fray<00:02:05.790> we<00:02:06.300> want<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.510> do

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
so then it doesn't fray we want to do

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:21.580 
so then it doesn't fray we want to do
that<00:02:06.780> on<00:02:06.870> both<00:02:07.020> sides<00:02:17.540> and<00:02:18.540> see<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:21.000> edge<00:02:21.150> is

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
that on both sides and see the edge is

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:50.180 
that on both sides and see the edge is
so<00:02:24.650> so<00:02:25.650> now<00:02:25.800> we're<00:02:26.010> going<00:02:26.220> to<00:02:29.780> attach<00:02:49.190> we're

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
so so now we're going to attach we're

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.720 
so so now we're going to attach we're
going<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.700> fold<00:02:51.690> that<00:02:54.860> edge<00:02:55.860> that<00:02:56.280> nematic

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
going to fold that edge that nematic

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.470 
going to fold that edge that nematic
we're<00:02:56.910> gonna<00:02:57.000> fold<00:02:57.300> that<00:02:57.420> under<00:02:58.610> and<00:02:59.610> match<00:03:00.180> it

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
we're gonna fold that under and match it

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:08.449 
we're gonna fold that under and match it
up<00:03:02.210> so<00:03:03.210> the<00:03:03.450> edges<00:03:03.840> are<00:03:04.140> nice<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:07.459> straight

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
up so the edges are nice and straight

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:19.850 
up so the edges are nice and straight
and<00:03:10.100> we<00:03:11.100> can<00:03:11.250> put<00:03:11.430> a<00:03:11.459> pin<00:03:11.730> in<00:03:11.760> there<00:03:18.650> just<00:03:19.650> to

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
and we can put a pin in there just to

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.979 
and we can put a pin in there just to
hold<00:03:20.070> it<00:03:20.250> while<00:03:20.370> we<00:03:20.580> solder<00:03:23.750> so<00:03:24.750> I'm<00:03:24.840> just

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
hold it while we solder so I'm just

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.180 
hold it while we solder so I'm just
going<00:03:25.110> to<00:03:25.140> use<00:03:25.260> my<00:03:25.290> sewing<00:03:25.590> machine<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:26.130> just

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
going to use my sewing machine and just

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.300 
going to use my sewing machine and just
go<00:03:26.430> to<00:03:26.459> a<00:03:26.610> straight<00:03:26.940> stitch<00:03:27.739> right<00:03:28.739> along<00:03:28.800> that

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
go to a straight stitch right along that

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:36.710 
go to a straight stitch right along that
seam<00:03:29.670> that<00:03:29.730> we<00:03:29.940> just<00:03:30.209> made<00:03:35.180> close<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.209> the<00:03:36.450> fold

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
seam that we just made close to the fold

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.770 
seam that we just made close to the fold
as<00:03:36.930> I<00:03:37.080> can<00:03:40.910> okay<00:03:41.910> so<00:03:41.970> we've<00:03:42.239> got<00:03:42.270> the<00:03:42.540> clip

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
as I can okay so we've got the clip

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:49.430 
as I can okay so we've got the clip
attached<00:03:43.680> it's<00:03:44.400> nice<00:03:44.580> and<00:03:44.790> secure<00:03:44.910> and<00:03:48.380> now<00:03:49.380> we

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
attached it's nice and secure and now we

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.510 
attached it's nice and secure and now we
need<00:03:49.620> to<00:03:49.650> do<00:03:49.770> something<00:03:49.920> with<00:03:50.070> the<00:03:50.190> other<00:03:50.220> side

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
need to do something with the other side

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.070 
need to do something with the other side
as<00:03:50.670> well<00:03:50.880> because<00:03:51.239> we<00:03:51.360> don't<00:03:51.540> want<00:03:51.690> that<00:03:51.750> rough

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
as well because we don't want that rough

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.860 
as well because we don't want that rough
