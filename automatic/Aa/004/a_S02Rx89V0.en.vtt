00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.990
 and very good youtube community too 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.250
 3.3 and it's been a long time since 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.590
 been asking you to do an analysis 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.660
 about the ix and the inquisitor will leave halo 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.910
 4 or about who are the promises is 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.430
 exactly among many other things 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.170
 good to start with the theme of the old evil 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.750
 first of all you must first have in 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.180
 mind that the promises are not the old 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.920
 badly we had it in e3 more precisely 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.840
 the old evil has not even been 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.640
 confirmed third unit the unit 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.259
 primary infantry in the game believe it 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.670
 more possible is that if it is but it has not 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.079
 confirmed nothing first of all is 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.730
 confirmed that these soldiers that we saw 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.100
 they are not exactly the old bad are 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.140
 soldiers of the possible old evil ni 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.089
 the promised ones are not even promising 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.829
 they are the four runner of the highest caste 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:47.469
 in the lines then ford runner 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.329
 obviously these are soldiers created 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:50.979
 for the fiancees for good 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.839
 intelligent artificial to defend 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:55.569
 certain places as bodyguards 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:57.760
 among other things but they are not promising 

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:59.859
 the fiancees are for organic owners 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.780
 living as a de facto didact 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:03.370
 it's a promising but good another very 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.140
 important is that at the end of this video 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.850
 we see a symbol the whole world is 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.340
 saying christi data but if we see 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.850
 comparison the emblems of both didac 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.250
 is there 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.409
 symbols are a little different though 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.689
 they are quite similar but because I say 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.880
 that this emblem does not belong to the idac 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:20.259
 also good first of all we have already 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.790
 seen that three for three industris no 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:23.500
 changed the logo of dÃ­dac are you 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.659
 we set in the last halo terminal 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.070
 anniversary here we see perfectly the 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.930
 direct symbol so is that you 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.520
 importen industris I never change it 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.350
 I update it so that as much as possible is 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.659
 that this does not belong although this is 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.460
 a theory is nothing official anything else 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.320
 very important is that didacta does not have 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.330
 why exactly hate humans 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.060
 that is, so he wanted revenge against 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.130
 us on the other facebook which is the 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.750
 master builder of elche geniuses 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.550
 has enough reasons why 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.110
 be angry with humans between 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.670
 they include for example the human 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.890
 ponds now known as three for 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.140
 three kings dispose ix or are you wanted 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.700
 revenge against him plus he for you 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.860
 the world is park remember that at 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.780
 final let the primordial have plans of 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.880
 go look for the supposedly alive 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.039
 librarian that the firm that is 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.990
 found in the ark and that can already 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.130
 give back life to his old friends 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.690
 dead 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.730
 because she supposedly could 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.740
 give back life by agreeing three four 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.750
 three kings shoot and so I 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.880
 I doubt the truth that these are promising 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.710
 exactly the old evil there will be a whole 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.630
 history and back of halo 4 so that's 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.580
 for the moment these are soldiers of the 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.830
 old bad they are not even I promise is 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.050
 exactly and that commands us should be 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.660
 the master builder is to say who 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.470
 has more merits to have an army 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.390
 of robots and the master builder 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.330
 builder facebook or whatever it 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.430
 know that is as it is obvious that 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.170
 the creator of the ice rings has 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.820
 more than an army of creators that 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.770
 create an army of robots or 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.660
 artificial intelligences to go in 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.890
 against the master boss or against 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.410
 anything that you are going through 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.660
 his path in requiem to his evil clan 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.880
 that the truth I do not know what is something else 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.350
 who have been asking me a lot and I 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.540
 I want it a bit obvious because there 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.270
 bad elites that is the leeds not in your 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.520
 part in halo 4 this is just a theory 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.650
 and it's nothing official, that's why 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.180
 please if I'm wrong do not come with 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.690
 apples to hit me in the head 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.390
 good 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.310
 leave it behind war is not specified 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.960
 clearly that there is a rebellion of leeds 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.480
 and humans against the leaders of the 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.850
 humanity in fact one of my mazzini 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.860
 more will basically deal with this good 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.780
 maybe he should not have said yet but 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.000
 good so is that these propellers that we saw 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.950
 they can clearly be only rebels 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.990
 the leeds that have four technology 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.330
 runner to which they agreed in a 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.980
 dyson sphere this technology the 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.960
 would do against human leaders 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.580
 and then obviously as three parts of the 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.860
 One is that they would also do it in your 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.570
 against which you are master success in addition if 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.790
 we look at this image from here we see 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.610
 a ruler cruiser next to what 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.500
 it seems to be a ship a great human ship 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.600
 I do not know if it will be a nexus infinity because 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.310
 well we saw that it crashed but without 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.170
 But here is flying is a bit 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.450
 strange that maybe they repaired it is not 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.420
 another ship I do not know but here we see what 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.160
 which is a ruling cruiser next to 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.510
 this human ship and they are attacking us in 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.730
 another mission with the same scheme 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.849
 desert we see this state 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.980
 some goes and a scorpion plus a 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:13.840
 doctor guard however they do not seem 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.760
 be a sign of attacking us 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.859
 They are pointing at each other besides 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.930
 that we do not see game if we see binner grade 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.850
 this is firing into another position 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.130
 that is, this is not shooting towards the 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.440
 master boss nor the scorpions is not 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.780
 shooting towards the opposite side as if 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.910
 they were the same team also 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.580
 remember that we have the inquisitor and 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.889
 to the commander batum reuters sorry or 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.810
 whatever his name is pronounced and 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:40.479
 these could still be good 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.370
 social loyal to the union between good 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:43.840
 is made and the separatist lines of 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.669
 ruler and good I hope you have them 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.199
 liked my analysis if it was like that and handy 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.479
 up subscribe your information forms 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:51.100
 has been of there are changes they liked leave 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:53.260
 your comments about how you 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:57.150
 this theory seems and we'll see 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.150
 the next letter all 3
