00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.479
 it started as a show worthy of 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.459
 photograph but gradually 

00:00:04.479 --> 00:00:08.260
 swells on the coast of the fifth 

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:09.880

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.750
 on this note the lifeguard of the place 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.970
 recounts the tense moments he lived at 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.259
 cause of this phenomenon that on purpose 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.359
 is going to be maintained during the end of 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:21.990
 week all these people who are there are 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:21.990
 have to run 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.669
 they were paralyzed tubes no one gave 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.189
 credit to what seconds before there was 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.059
 past a wave took about 20 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.710
 people 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.699
 immediately attention and anguish 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.699
 he seized all 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.960
 to a situation one of the most tense 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.660
 they live and it was a current that 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.770
 took at least about 20 people 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.960
 we had to get all the people 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.760
 collect them and collect them 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.039
 all in the lake is already 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.809
 rich but motorcycles and volunteers tried 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.449
 to save those that the sea and its strength 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.600
 did not return like that at least 20 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.600
 minutes 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.299
 among them rodolfo wall lifeguard of 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.310
 the yellow beach of Concon saves 5 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.890
 people say it's a fight with the 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.049
 today mar is grateful to be alive 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.030
 when entering the heart they were 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.630
 distributed everywhere and it was a chaos 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.220
 because work and life help 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.390
 all the side so we are 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.080
 software only the other person 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.789
 against 18 so very difficult 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.679
 We collected them and little by little we went 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:31.229
 leaving the pot we were all in the 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:33.710
 pot luckily basin victim fatal not 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:38.190
 not luckily not fortunately 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.229
 we are well and we received helped there was no 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.420
 seriously injured in yellow beach are the 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.459
 swells and their strength sometimes taken to 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.679
 The slight reason for refreshment photos 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:49.049
 passenger for some who take advantage 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:51.420
 this particular reaction of the sea the 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.229
 Thursday night he lived his peak moment 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.229
 in the vineyard of the sea 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.350
 but you still run a risk if you have to 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.719
 be very careful with the rules 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.539
 stay with children who do not upload them to 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:07.500
 the rocks because it is equally dangerous 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:07.500
 since yes 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.239
 winds that come from Easter Island and 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.980
 generate waves that hit our strong 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.080
 coasts for the 'armada' a stranger 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.090
 phenomenon for these dates and that 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.580
 expands from north arica to 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.860
 past the central area of â€‹â€‹wave train 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.830
 that is entering is with its greater 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.780
 magnitude today and tomorrow but it's going to 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.569
 keep present here on the coast of the 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.060
 fifth region until Monday to 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.799
 least for many something that adorns their 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.140
 vacation but for others like 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.540
 tourists who were with something that without 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.730
 doubt they were marked forever by 20 people 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.840
 that certainly will not forget what the sea 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.840
 he made them pass
