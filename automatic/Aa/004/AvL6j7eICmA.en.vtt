00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
connector for it because it had this but

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.200 
connector for it because it had this but

you're changing wheels a lot if you're
at<00:04:57.000> races<00:04:57.450> or<00:04:57.600> whatever<00:04:57.870> um<00:04:58.560> it<00:04:59.550> gets<00:05:00.330> them

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480 
at races or whatever um it gets them

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.250 
at races or whatever um it gets them
down<00:05:00.690> pretty<00:05:00.960> quick<00:05:02.300> all<00:05:03.300> I<00:05:03.360> had<00:05:03.750> to<00:05:03.780> replace

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
down pretty quick all I had to replace

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.160 
down pretty quick all I had to replace
this<00:05:04.710> one<00:05:04.980> the<00:05:05.640> hand<00:05:06.210> grip<00:05:06.480> the<00:05:06.720> hand<00:05:06.990> guard

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
this one the hand grip the hand guard

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.710 
this one the hand grip the hand guard
whatever<00:05:07.620> oh<00:05:07.890> it<00:05:08.460> snapped<00:05:08.790> when<00:05:09.270> I<00:05:09.300> was

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
whatever oh it snapped when I was

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.170 
whatever oh it snapped when I was
turning<00:05:10.050> sharp<00:05:10.590> and<00:05:10.860> I<00:05:10.920> flipped<00:05:11.340> and<00:05:11.550> it<00:05:11.700> just

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
turning sharp and I flipped and it just

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.970 
turning sharp and I flipped and it just
crushed<00:05:12.570> it<00:05:14.180> if<00:05:15.180> you<00:05:15.450> were<00:05:15.660> getting<00:05:16.440> this<00:05:16.680> car

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
crushed it if you were getting this car

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.100 
crushed it if you were getting this car
it's<00:05:17.430> definitely<00:05:17.940> good<00:05:18.300> investment<00:05:18.810> if<00:05:18.960> you

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
it's definitely good investment if you

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.480 
it's definitely good investment if you
want<00:05:19.350> to<00:05:19.560> spend<00:05:19.800> more<00:05:19.950> money<00:05:20.100> and<00:05:20.310> get<00:05:20.400> the

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
want to spend more money and get the

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.630 
want to spend more money and get the
four<00:05:20.790> wheel<00:05:21.000> drive<00:05:22.010> probably<00:05:23.010> better<00:05:23.160> off<00:05:23.250> me

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640 
four wheel drive probably better off me

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.400 
four wheel drive probably better off me
formulas<00:05:24.210> for<00:05:24.840> real<00:05:25.220> um<00:05:26.690> yeah<00:05:27.690> about<00:05:27.780> the<00:05:28.170> body

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410

the<00:05:35.340> trip<00:05:36.120> is<00:05:36.480> I<00:05:36.750> just<00:05:37.230> call<00:05:37.470> this<00:05:37.620> my

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:37.920 
the trip is I just call this my

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.710 
the trip is I just call this my
body<00:05:38.370> I<00:05:39.080> also<00:05:40.080> had<00:05:40.350> to<00:05:40.470> make<00:05:40.620> modifications

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 
body I also had to make modifications

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.200 
body I also had to make modifications
for<00:05:42.720> these<00:05:42.990> snow<00:05:43.350> tires<00:05:43.650> or<00:05:43.890> sand<00:05:44.490> tires<00:05:44.700> to

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
for these snow tires or sand tires to

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.510 
for these snow tires or sand tires to
work<00:05:45.590> because<00:05:46.590> they<00:05:46.800> were<00:05:46.860> rubbing<00:05:47.370> up

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
work because they were rubbing up

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.670 
work because they were rubbing up
against<00:05:47.910> the<00:05:48.920> plastic<00:05:49.920> here<00:05:50.190> and<00:05:50.460> it<00:05:50.700> wasn't

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
against the plastic here and it wasn't

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.760 
against the plastic here and it wasn't
going<00:05:52.680> as<00:05:52.860> well<00:05:53.130> so<00:05:54.170> when<00:05:55.170> it's<00:05:55.350> going<00:05:55.590> down

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
going as well so when it's going down

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.800 
going as well so when it's going down
and<00:05:56.340> it's<00:05:56.520> driving<00:05:56.820> you<00:05:57.150> can<00:05:57.270> see<00:05:57.480> now<00:05:57.630> it

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
and it's driving you can see now it

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.460 
and it's driving you can see now it
clears<00:05:58.140> it<00:05:59.030> so<00:06:00.030> before<00:06:00.570> it<00:06:00.930> was<00:06:01.020> like<00:06:01.230> touching

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
clears it so before it was like touching

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.280 
clears it so before it was like touching
like<00:06:01.830> that<00:06:01.860> so<00:06:02.460> foot<00:06:03.300> when<00:06:03.450> you<00:06:03.570> raise<00:06:03.780> it<00:06:03.810> it's

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:04.290 
like that so foot when you raise it it's

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.830 
like that so foot when you raise it it's
pretty<00:06:04.770> good<00:06:05.040> now<00:06:05.220> thinking<00:06:05.640> about<00:06:05.970> like<00:06:06.810> I

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 
pretty good now thinking about like I

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.990 
pretty good now thinking about like I
said<00:06:07.170> getting<00:06:07.650> better<00:06:08.070> x<00:06:08.600> suspension<00:06:10.430> so<00:06:11.430> I

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 
said getting better x suspension so I

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.540 
said getting better x suspension so I
think<00:06:12.120> that's<00:06:12.600> about<00:06:12.780> it<00:06:12.930> for<00:06:13.110> today<00:06:13.380> I<00:06:14.130> might

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550 
think that's about it for today I might

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:19.730 
think that's about it for today I might
be<00:06:14.700> making<00:06:15.030> some<00:06:15.180> more<00:06:15.390> videos<00:06:16.520> but<00:06:18.740> the

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
be making some more videos but the

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.230 
be making some more videos but the
another<00:06:20.160> truck<00:06:20.490> I<00:06:20.640> would<00:06:20.790> probably<00:06:20.910> want<00:06:21.150> to

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
another truck I would probably want to
