00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.790
 hi to all dear readers the building 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.009
 fan page and welcome to ours 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.719
 new video today as you can 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.930
 see we are in the company of 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.760
 iphone 5 equipped with ios 7 beta 1 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.830
 the new mobile operating system of 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.279
 apple presented in recent days in the 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.550
 course of wwe 2013 as mentioned yes 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.840
 is the first beta of the software is 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.940
 reserved for developers and not there 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.550
 so be surprised if you do 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.890
 find any sins of 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.899
 youth of this software since the 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.110
 its final version will be released at 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.059
 public next October 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.550
 however, a 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.350
 serious bug related to the security of the 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.719
 terminal and that puts at risk precisely 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.579
 user privacy by exploiting 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.949
 precisely new control center 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.170
 one of the innovations introduced by apple with 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.789
 his new operating system will be 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.460
 You can get around the lock code 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.199
 which allows users to 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.360
 lock your smartphone 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.060
 the facts as you can see the code of 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.560
 lock for this smartphone 3 1 2 3 4 e 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.360
 once entered it allows us to 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.119
 access the home without any problem 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.759
 then the code works correctly 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.280
 at the time when a 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.030
 wrong code and not allow access 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.330
 to the smartphone 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.280
 however it is possible to turn it in part 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.070
 as he said through the new center of 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.979
 check as you can see by logging in 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.689
 in fact to the photo gallery there 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.490
 allows you to view the camera roll 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.939
 through the shortcut present 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.520
 in home 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.560
 however exploiting the connection 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.060
 present inside the control center 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.930
 that allow us as you can see of 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.590
 access the alarm clock the 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.240
 calculator or camera 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.630
 we will not be denied access to 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.310
 roll of photos and it will be possible to view 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.390
 completely all the photographs 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.920
 user of smartphone owners 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.240
 without any problem 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.939
 the photo may also be 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.040
 modified deleted but what even more 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.009
 serious can be shared on social networks 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.360
 network or sent by rid too much 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.540
 precisely that via email 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.040
 without any problem consequently 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.049
 called a security flaw 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.959
 quite serious and we hope 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:21.340
 apple can solve over the 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.500
 next release of his system 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.540
 therefore operational for this video is 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.189
 all I'm matteo ferrara for a while 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.269
 fan page and thank you for watching 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:30.269
