00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.680
 [Music] 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.780
 with which I think I eat a little more of 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:35.809
 cheese 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.309
 and everything and does not respect anything even my 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.309
 nap before eating 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.610
 a champion 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.000
 I have contradictions 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.320
 ok i 'm going 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:16.870
 and this dorsinvil 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.870
 We will go through the gardens to reach them 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:25.200
 [Music] 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.200
 very 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:34.720
 I found a key but warned me 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:39.850
 I refuse to carry more than one key at a time 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.850
 a lot of weight for a poor comfortable kitten 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:51.610
 two 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.610
 I can jump if I have to 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.130
 but do not pass is exhausting and I do not 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.900
 you force to jump too high you do not want 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.820
 that really hurt me 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.450
 [Music] 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.450
 well 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.510
 You will have to open some doors with a 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:21.010
 switch instead of with a key 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.909
 you have to hold down the 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.170
 switch for the door 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.650
 stay open 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.930
 [Music] 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.040
 and he was going to think that another would serve to 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:33.110
 something or from here 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:36.259
 [Music] 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.259
 [Applause] 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.739
 ah 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.280
 here 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.120
 [Music] 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.170
 Y 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:55.269
 and this flea bag that has bitten that 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:59.550
 it is clear to you if something happens to me again 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:02.040
 so I will not give up 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.790
 [Music] 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.120
 when they provoke me, he attacked especially 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:19.159
 when my food is at stake 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:19.159
 [Music] 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.239
 I can pick up these ingredients and 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.239
 prepare a good meal 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.830
 [Music] 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.760
 this could end up being a 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.760
 delicious lasagna 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.060
 ah 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.129
 [Music] 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:05.869
 [Music] 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:22.300
 [Music] 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.590
 and I think I need your help again 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:49.499
 to lower the tier 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:49.499
 [Music] 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:01.980
 you have to know that I refuse to swim 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:04.110
 I get tired too much and I've put on a shampoo 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.270
 extra special shine so if I 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.620
 I fall to the water 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.620
 you can go forgetting about me 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.349
 some switches do not open doors 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.060
 but they can turn things or make 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:18.050
 the objects are placed 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.639
 [Music] 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:25.289
 two 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:26.160
 this is getting me into another that both 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:29.629
 but no 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.629
 [Music] 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.800
 then 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:06:05.490
 [Music] 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:19.860
 or 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:19.860
 [Music] 

00:06:33.640 --> 00:07:36.910
 [Music] 

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:46.500
 and you are going to fall, you have fallen 

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:54.070
 if falling into holes was a sport 

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:55.490
 I hate would be the world hobby champion 

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:58.010
 d 

00:07:55.490 --> 00:08:00.420
 [Music] 

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:04.100
 or 

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:06.720
 this game could be called garfield 

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:09.040
 rescuing a stupid clumsy dog ​​and 

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:11.859
 let's go to truth 

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.859
