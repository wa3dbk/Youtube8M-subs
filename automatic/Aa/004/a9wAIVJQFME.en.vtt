00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
should work you shouldn't get a black

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.850 
should work you shouldn't get a black
screen<00:02:43.790> or<00:02:44.150> anything<00:02:44.540> like<00:02:44.570> that<00:02:44.739> you're<00:02:45.739> not

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860

00:02:48.709 --> 00:03:15.260 
deleting any meta and files or anything
like<00:02:48.739> that<00:02:50.080> alright<00:02:51.080> let's<00:02:51.560> test<00:02:51.830> it<00:02:51.920> out

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.530 

and<00:03:15.990> it<00:03:16.110> might<00:03:16.200> lag<00:03:16.440> a<00:03:16.470> little<00:03:16.770> bit<00:03:17.540> ScreenFlow

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
and it might lag a little bit ScreenFlow

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.840 
and it might lag a little bit ScreenFlow
really<00:03:18.900> kind<00:03:19.410> of<00:03:19.500> slows<00:03:20.190> down<00:03:20.310> my<00:03:20.460> computer<00:03:20.520> a

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.010 
really kind of slows down my computer a
little<00:03:21.030> bit<00:03:21.120> sometimes<00:03:21.450> when<00:03:21.630> I'm<00:03:21.720> trying<00:03:21.960> to
