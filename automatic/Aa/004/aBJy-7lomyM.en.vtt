00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.170
 good afternoon, we are going to take a seat 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:11.700
 please let's keep quiet to give 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.589
 start to this talk by the 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.080
 buseta today's topic is super 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:18.990
 interesting has to do with the worlds 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.269
 without fame particularly when we speak 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.699
 of the solar system it is very likely that 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:25.859
 our minds come to us in names 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.170
 of planets that are indeed very 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.779
 famous as Mars or Saturn for example 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.580
 and of which maybe it's not very 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.800
 difficult to locate them within any 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.989
 photography however when we speak 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.379
 of the solar system of our system 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.920
 solar and it is already very important to consider 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.910
 that there are other official worlds in 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.760
 which the astronomical union 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.399
 international has cataloged us as 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.850
 dwarf planets these dwarf planets 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.219
 they had a very different origin from that of 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.570
 origin that the eight experienced 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.750
 planets that are part of our 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.059
 well we know that they are eight planets 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.640
 official and to these we are going to add them 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.640
 five new worlds 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.050
 what are going to be the dwarf planets 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.080
 system officials 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.720
 and of course that this union 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.630
 astronomical has already designated them a 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.850
 name to each one 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.610
 official and we will know them 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.050
 precisely on this slide we have 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.150
 to ceres we have 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.520
 a pluton that is the one that can most 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.570
 sound familiar and the last three that 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.610
 they are the sea that mccain and still of course 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.490
 that things can change because there 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.000
 Many 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.560
 objects up there that are not right 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.369
 cataloged and things can change 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:50.690
 you have to remember that the proton before 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:52.400
 has considered a planet and happened to be 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.170
 breach dwarf goal happened to be 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.580
 simply 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.350
 according to the characteristic 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.500
 showed especially the new 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:04.270
 guidelines I have another reference to 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.670
 that being is which before 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.500
 to an asteroid but because of its orbit and 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.950
 other metrics met the 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.510
 requirements to be a dwarf planet 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.120
 eventually the list of planets 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.860
 dwarfs is going to swell because there are 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.440
 many bodies out there that even 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.440
 they are candidates to be dwarf planets 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.040
 and today there are illusions that they want 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.540
 objectives to approach 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.250
 two 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.170
 some of these dwarf planets for 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:38.459
 understand its origin 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.260
 in factors and eventually they will go 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.910
 increasing the number of planets 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.780
 discovered though 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.850
 and they also go and reveal the secrets 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.040
 d 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.569
 part of the bus that's all for 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.969
 today on this topic 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.889
 fast we hope you have stayed 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:58.439
 some curiosity so that each one to 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:03:00.540
 particular title can search 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:02.760
 information you can know a little more about 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.549
 background these issues that certainly are 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.599
 fascinating my name is daniel and it was a 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.599
 pleasure to be with you
