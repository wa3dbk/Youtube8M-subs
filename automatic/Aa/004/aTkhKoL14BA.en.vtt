00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.860
 Y 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.020
 or the shortest one today I hope 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.240
 that they are very very well I am very 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.730
 happy because the brand says we 're going 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.180
 to do today I love it is 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.430
 super pretty and it's very fast and very easy 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.770
 let's make a souvenir that is ideal 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.720
 for 15th birthday or also for 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.210
 any other occasion we want to give 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.129
 a nice present what excites me the most 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.860
 in this craft, we're going to make you 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.020
 recycling plastic caps 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.690
 bottle cards and it's great 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.180
 because we do it very fast and we can 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.990
 make millions in a ray for love 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.760
 of healthy let's see how they are made 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:01:01.370
 The materials that we will need are 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:06.210
 plastic caps of any bottle 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:08.580
 a little piece of black acrylic cardboard 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.680
 I know if another type of paint will work well 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.290
 to paint the plastic so they 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.810
 I recommend the acrylic that paints it very 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.200
 well seen in gluers or any 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:24.900
 glue a strip of baby tape or 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:30.990
 any ribbon to decorate and a patch 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:39.119
 of tulle the first thing we are going to do is 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:41.100
 paint the lid with black acrylic and 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.619
 while it dries we are making a 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.080
 circle on the cardboard this has to be 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.660
 a little larger than the cap and 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.310
 also in black paint what you 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.600
 they can use the colors that they 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.630
 like 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.909
 and when it dries we paint the other side 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.479
 of the circle the good thing is that it dries very 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.479
 Quick 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:11.700
 now we are going to stick the stage in the 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:13.680
 center of the cardboard circle now in 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.590
 a card or the material that you 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.580
 want we are going to do these ways that 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.209
 They simulate being feathers and we stick them behind 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.209
 from the top 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.190
 now we grab our cloth tape and 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:40.370
 we stick it around the lid to 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:42.290
 cover any imperfection what 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.600
 next is to grab the tulle and what 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.240
 we folded in half we fussed with the 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.490
 hands the bottom part and we paste it in 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:54.620
 one side of the front of the 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:57.140
 tapita and as last touch we hit 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.380
 a little flower in the center of the 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.380
 tulle 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.190
 just want to add the card 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.610
 we write what we want and we paste it 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.530
 in the bottom of the hat and 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.410
 ready we have a nice hat 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.900
 miniature I like it very much 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.360
 super cute and we can also do it 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.650
 to use only as a decoration without need 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.650
 that it is a souvenir 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.690
