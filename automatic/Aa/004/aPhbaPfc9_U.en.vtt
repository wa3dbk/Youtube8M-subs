00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.250
 and there the good person first to plus one 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.949
 channel video 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.539
 the staff like day 29 windows 10 was 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.180
 released to the public, right? 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.010
 It's as you know, day has been released. 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.689
 a little before on the 15th if you do not 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.289
 cheating for anyone who was from the project 'insider 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.420
 of 2,140 is now it has been released there 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.219
 staff is like a lot of people with 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.170
 doubt of how to update I solved 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.450
 record this video already the first people 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.700
 will have that in microsoft websites 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.770
 I'll leave it in the description of the site there 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.290
 you will choose which system 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.440
 you want on this 32 bit and 64 bit 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.239
 bits is who had booked to whom 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.059
 remembers that during the work he stayed in the 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.059
 reserve icon will be able to see 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.350
 free of charge whoever has original 12 is 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.850
 assurance 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.010
 there are those who do not have not so much 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.930
 sure like this but we 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.550
 may be making the steps there who have 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.170
 windows that is not original and managed 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.760
 migrate on a good 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.530
 leave it a good comment, we'll go 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.900
 download this little problem here is in 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.060
 personal site is worth remembering who 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.950
 upgrade the computer does not matter if the 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.850
 windows 7 or not, you do not lose your 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.320
 files 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.869
 although it is recommended that you make a 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.689
 what backup windows which will make 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.700
 if you settle on it it will not go 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.320
 to do a clean formatting is to pay everything 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.810
 what do you have a floor to ward off 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.460
 world and install on top 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.170
 if you do not want to install this now 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.150
 computer you can create a media 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.650
 to install on other has no problem 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.450
 We'll settle in here with the 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.100
 The light's gone now 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.619
 get a scan of your download 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.399
 right to see if it has any kind in the shot 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.920
 iso that something like this has been downloaded 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.360
 and now it will start to create media and 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.750
 probably the installation from here 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.700
 little relative mind a medium process 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.530
 delayed onset of the group and 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.290
 start the installation itself will be more 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.909
 fast is good here are the themes of 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.270
 license 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.890
 It's from microsoft you obviously do not 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.110
 unless you want to read everything and 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.989
 refuse it probably will already be 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.670
 installed with everything at once in this 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:19.680
 will have to do the update after 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.170
 install windows not the staff after 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.090
 to do all the verification and completion 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.849
 it's updates 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.610
 He's already asking you to install it. 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:32.129
 and here change what should be kept in the 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.260
 case but if you want to keep nothing 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:35.489
 it will do the installation only if you 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.390
 want to keep only the files 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.769
 personal 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.810
 it will not delete everything from your 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.150
 computer is not the most important things 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.190
 keep apps running 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.170
 personal files will leave your 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.299
 windows basically like it is there 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.390
 now will not pay anything to make a 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:53.129
 installation without any problems 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.650
 good and also got enough space 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:57.150
 now we're going to install it probably 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.140
 I'll have to restart the machine then 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.930
 when windows was totally 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.810
 installed I'll be back and good staff 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.519
 after all that verification is of 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.709
 reboot the machine everything has been installed 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.620
 correctly without having lost any 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.549
 type of file is as you can see 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.989
 windows is already in full 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.209
 operation 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.620
 let's check here the question of 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.900
 right x right 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.340
 we used the initial water stop to 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:28.470
 check with the manager version is 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:30.750
 installed and how you can see objects 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.480
 installed is a dozen is what it means 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.549
 that the new one by microsoft already comes native 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.900
 It's like I said before it 's because it has 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.970
 a staff that is asking why 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.359
 is not showing up right now because it installs the 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.970
 windows 10 does not appear is personal in 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:48.510
 amd cards and directx 12 is compatible 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:51.030
 with the hd7000 series onwards and in the series 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:55.680
 nvidia series 4,000 or so 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:57.329
 480 and 580 are all going to get support 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.120
 to directx 12 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:04.319
 if your plate is not it is a little bit more 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.280
 old one hd 5000 or a much plate 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.829
 old 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.470
 will not have direct x 2 installed and will 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:12.180
 install 11.1 the same way you used it 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.540
 no windows 7 right? 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.609
 The interesting thing is that even doing 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.079
 when you are installing 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.269
 the drivers are also fully 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.240
 installed as you can see has no 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.930
 none is not asking you to install 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.759
 anything right 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.310
 it automatically installs the 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:31.080
 drivers the video only hope you guys 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.240
 liked it was the quick tutorial and 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.370
 more to explain to people who had 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.440
 afraid to install over and lost 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.750
 files is not you can not use 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:43.350
 files your drivers and systems 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:45.150
 contacts are still a good thing 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.940
 operating system recommend everyone there 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.020
 curious to install and test 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.180
 really worth it 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.710
 Then I even made a comparative video. 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.780
 with windows 7 on some tests will be 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.030
 here in the inscription along with the 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:00.000
 microsoft for you to download the program is 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:03.110
 what you need is just this leaves everyone 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.110
 comments and even
