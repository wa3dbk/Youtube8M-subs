00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
show you the contrast between these are

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.370 
show you the contrast between these are
eyes<00:03:09.660> those<00:03:09.930> stickers<00:03:11.720> so<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.810> stickers<00:03:13.170> look

gonna go too far into everything but

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.080 
gonna go too far into everything but
I'll<00:03:24.440> just<00:03:24.799> I<00:03:25.010> guess<00:03:25.220> I'll<00:03:25.400> make<00:03:25.459> a<00:03:25.610> review<00:03:25.909> on

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
I'll just I guess I'll make a review on

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.589 
I'll just I guess I'll make a review on
this<00:03:26.239> I<00:03:26.420> guess<00:03:26.480> later<00:03:28.390> so<00:03:29.390> if<00:03:29.480> you're

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 
this I guess later so if you're

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.350 
this I guess later so if you're
wondering<00:03:29.930> about<00:03:29.959> the<00:03:30.290> stickers<00:03:30.769> there<00:03:31.400> I'm

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
wondering about the stickers there I'm

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.789 
wondering about the stickers there I'm
not<00:03:32.510> gonna<00:03:32.629> shoot<00:03:32.900> I'm<00:03:33.110> not<00:03:33.290> gonna<00:03:33.440> open<00:03:33.650> them

not gonna shoot I'm not gonna open them

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.110 
not gonna shoot I'm not gonna open them

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:01.129 
about the Cubist this is a better angle

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:03.190 
about the Cubist this is a better angle
this<00:04:01.519> won't<00:04:01.760> be<00:04:01.879> a<00:04:01.910> full<00:04:02.180> review<00:04:02.540> I'll<00:04:02.810> make<00:04:03.019> a

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:08.629 
better look at the stickers this is the

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:12.160 
better look at the stickers this is the
fluorescent<00:04:09.410> orange<00:04:09.620> I<00:04:09.980> believe<00:04:10.840> and<00:04:11.840> this<00:04:12.019> is

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
fluorescent orange I believe and this is

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.550 
fluorescent orange I believe and this is
the<00:04:12.290> bright<00:04:12.500> orange<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:14.780> contrast<00:04:15.230> is<00:04:15.349> really

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
the bright orange the contrast is really

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.620 
the bright orange the contrast is really
good<00:04:15.920> but<00:04:16.130> in<00:04:16.370> the<00:04:16.459> camera<00:04:16.910> it<00:04:17.209> doesn't<00:04:17.389> look

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
good but in the camera it doesn't look

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.560 
good but in the camera it doesn't look
very<00:04:17.799> it<00:04:18.799> doesn't<00:04:18.829> look<00:04:19.220> like<00:04:19.850> between<00:04:20.329> these

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
very it doesn't look like between these

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.230 
very it doesn't look like between these
colors<00:04:20.840> doesn't<00:04:21.199> look<00:04:21.289> very<00:04:21.320> much<00:04:22.210> of<00:04:23.210> a

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
colors doesn't look very much of a

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.020 
colors doesn't look very much of a
contrast<00:04:23.630> but<00:04:24.370> in<00:04:25.370> real<00:04:25.550> life<00:04:25.729> it's<00:04:25.910> actually

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
contrast but in real life it's actually

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.680 
contrast but in real life it's actually
a<00:04:26.450> great<00:04:26.900> contrast<00:04:27.380> so<00:04:28.090> this<00:04:29.090> cube<00:04:29.389> turns

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
a great contrast so this cube turns

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.940 
a great contrast so this cube turns
amazingly<00:04:30.440> it<00:04:30.830> is<00:04:30.860> loo<00:04:31.310> it<00:04:31.760> is<00:04:32.300> lubricated

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.560 

so<00:04:36.950> I<00:04:37.010> can<00:04:37.130> already<00:04:37.310> tell<00:04:37.520> you<00:04:37.700> the<00:04:37.910> turning<00:04:38.389> on

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
so I can already tell you the turning on

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.600 
so I can already tell you the turning on
this<00:04:38.740> amazing<00:04:39.789> it's<00:04:40.789> just<00:04:41.800> it's<00:04:42.800> awesome<00:04:43.010> and

I<00:04:43.849> really<00:04:44.060> like<00:04:44.389> the<00:04:44.539> stickers<00:04:44.930> cuz<00:04:45.410> they're

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
I really like the stickers cuz they're

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:56.430 
I really like the stickers cuz they're
cut<00:04:45.919> perfectly<00:04:46.450> and<00:04:48.760> the<00:04:49.760> cube<00:04:50.090> is<00:04:50.300> mutated

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.320 

and<00:04:57.440> it's<00:04:57.710> like<00:04:57.860> a<00:04:57.889> perfect<00:04:58.280> size<00:04:58.639> for<00:04:58.669> me<00:04:58.970> and

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
and it's like a perfect size for me and

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.760 
and it's like a perfect size for me and
I've<00:04:59.630> heard<00:04:59.870> that<00:04:59.960> the<00:05:00.110> plastic<00:05:00.560> is<00:05:00.680> a<00:05:00.710> little

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
I've heard that the plastic is a little

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.360 
I've heard that the plastic is a little
bit<00:05:01.039> different<00:05:01.430> but<00:05:02.210> I<00:05:02.570> guess<00:05:03.050> maybe<00:05:03.800> it's<00:05:04.250> not

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
bit different but I guess maybe it's not

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.370 
bit different but I guess maybe it's not
much<00:05:04.639> of<00:05:04.820> a<00:05:04.880> difference<00:05:05.240> like<00:05:05.450> it's<00:05:06.020> not<00:05:06.169> like

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
much of a difference like it's not like

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.950 
much of a difference like it's not like
if<00:05:06.889> you<00:05:07.430> had<00:05:07.669> a<00:05:07.700> regular<00:05:08.060> as<00:05:08.330> a<00:05:08.450> G<00:05:08.510> and<00:05:08.780> then<00:05:08.870> an

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
if you had a regular as a G and then an

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.719 
if you had a regular as a G and then an
original<00:05:09.830> plastic<00:05:10.130> and<00:05:10.310> it's<00:05:10.400> just<00:05:10.580> not<00:05:10.700> that

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
original plastic and it's just not that

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:13.140 
original plastic and it's just not that
big<00:05:10.940> of<00:05:11.479> a<00:05:11.630> difference<00:05:11.780> in<00:05:12.050> the<00:05:12.110> plastic<00:05:12.560> but

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
big of a difference in the plastic but

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.909 
big of a difference in the plastic but
you<00:05:14.150> know<00:05:14.240> it<00:05:14.419> could<00:05:14.599> be<00:05:14.780> a<00:05:14.810> difference<00:05:15.440> but<00:05:15.620> I

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
you know it could be a difference but I

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:17.529 
you know it could be a difference but I
don't<00:05:16.250> really<00:05:16.340> feel<00:05:16.430> much<00:05:16.820> of<00:05:16.849> a<00:05:17.000> difference

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:17.539 
don't really feel much of a difference

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:21.670 
don't really feel much of a difference
let's<00:05:18.470> see<00:05:18.620> Cory<00:05:18.949> penny

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.850 

so<00:05:22.680> corner-cutting<00:05:23.340> it's<00:05:24.180> amazing<00:05:24.960> really

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
so corner-cutting it's amazing really

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.500 
so corner-cutting it's amazing really
great<00:05:26.250> quarter<00:05:26.460> Kenny<00:05:26.730> yeah<00:05:27.600> so<00:05:29.300> this<00:05:30.300> is

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
great quarter Kenny yeah so this is

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:38.570 
great quarter Kenny yeah so this is
about<00:05:31.430> that<00:05:32.430> far<00:05:33.290> this<00:05:34.290> is<00:05:34.410> 45<00:05:34.830> degrees<00:05:36.800> a<00:05:37.800> bit

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
about that far this is 45 degrees a bit

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.910 
about that far this is 45 degrees a bit
more<00:05:38.820> than<00:05:38.940> 45<00:05:39.330> I<00:05:39.660> guess<00:05:39.960> it<00:05:40.140> kind<00:05:40.470> of<00:05:40.530> cut<00:05:40.710> not

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:40.920 
more than 45 I guess it kind of cut not

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.580 
more than 45 I guess it kind of cut not
really<00:05:41.630> the<00:05:42.630> reverse<00:05:42.780> corner<00:05:43.170> cutting<00:05:43.260> is

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
really the reverse corner cutting is

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.460 
really the reverse corner cutting is
about<00:05:43.860> that<00:05:44.010> far<00:05:44.480> it's<00:05:45.480> great<00:05:45.900> oh<00:05:46.050> that<00:05:46.350> was

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
about that far it's great oh that was

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:56.150 
about that far it's great oh that was
the<00:05:46.500> other<00:05:46.680> way<00:05:50.870> that<00:05:51.870> was<00:05:52.020> deeper<00:05:55.010> kind<00:05:56.010> of

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 
the other way that was deeper kind of

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.060 
the other way that was deeper kind of
failed<00:05:56.400> there<00:05:56.960> so<00:05:57.960> the<00:05:58.290> cube<00:05:58.560> the<00:05:58.680> stick<00:05:58.890> the

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 
failed there so the cube the stick the

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.390 
failed there so the cube the stick the
shades<00:05:59.370> are<00:05:59.640> really<00:06:00.300> amazing<00:06:00.510> and<00:06:01.220> let's<00:06:02.220> just

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
shades are really amazing and let's just

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.260 
shades are really amazing and let's just
take<00:06:02.610> a<00:06:02.640> look<00:06:02.850> at<00:06:03.000> the<00:06:03.120> pieces<00:06:04.970> Wow

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
take a look at the pieces Wow

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.960 
take a look at the pieces Wow
so<00:06:06.480> the<00:06:06.600> pieces<00:06:06.780> are<00:06:07.020> exactly<00:06:07.560> the<00:06:07.740> same<00:06:07.770> as<00:06:08.220> a

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:08.970 
so the pieces are exactly the same as a

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:13.460 
so the pieces are exactly the same as a
regular<00:06:09.180> zhanchi<00:06:10.970> they're<00:06:11.970> like<00:06:12.470> they're

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.470 
regular zhanchi they're like they're

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.270 
regular zhanchi they're like they're
like<00:06:13.500> actually<00:06:14.250> identical<00:06:14.820> can't<00:06:15.510> see<00:06:16.280> any

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 
like actually identical can't see any

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.510 
like actually identical can't see any
difference<00:06:17.460> I<00:06:18.770> already<00:06:19.770> know<00:06:20.010> it's<00:06:20.190> gonna<00:06:20.310> be

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 
difference I already know it's gonna be

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.760 
difference I already know it's gonna be
exactly<00:06:20.580> the<00:06:20.970> same<00:06:21.150> as<00:06:21.330> ng<00:06:21.810> but<00:06:21.990> I<00:06:22.290> don't<00:06:22.710> know

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
exactly the same as ng but I don't know

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.620 
exactly the same as ng but I don't know
why<00:06:22.920> but<00:06:23.190> this<00:06:23.490> is<00:06:23.640> the<00:06:23.880> turning<00:06:24.240> on<00:06:24.330> this<00:06:24.480> is

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:24.630 
why but this is the turning on this is

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.510 
why but this is the turning on this is
better<00:06:24.900> than<00:06:25.110> my<00:06:25.170> 57-millimeter<00:06:26.040> I<00:06:26.340> don't

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 
better than my 57-millimeter I don't

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:33.380 
better than my 57-millimeter I don't
know<00:06:26.610> why<00:06:27.680> and<00:06:28.680> it's<00:06:29.340> just<00:06:31.790> the<00:06:32.790> turning<00:06:33.180> just

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:33.390 
know why and it's just the turning just

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:35.630 
know why and it's just the turning just
better<00:06:33.660> overall<00:06:34.080> for<00:06:34.500> some<00:06:34.650> reason<00:06:34.980> I'm<00:06:35.490> not

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:35.640 
better overall for some reason I'm not
