whatever<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.890> well<00:02:02.579> this<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.729> kind<00:02:02.969> of<00:02:03.000> like<00:02:03.090> a

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
whatever you well this is kind of like a

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.770 
whatever you well this is kind of like a
nexus<00:02:03.540> s<00:02:03.689> rom<00:02:04.130> I<00:02:05.540> don't<00:02:06.540> know<00:02:06.600> what<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:06.750> call

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780

nexus s rom I don't know what you call
that<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.140> guess<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.829> could<00:02:07.979> say<00:02:08.129> it's<00:02:08.250> a

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
that I guess you could say it's a

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.630 
that I guess you could say it's a
gingerbread<00:02:08.729> stock<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.450> guess<00:02:10.459> that's<00:02:11.459> the

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
gingerbread stock I guess that's the

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.370 
gingerbread stock I guess that's the
only<00:02:11.730> downside<00:02:12.420> i<00:02:12.450> love<00:02:12.900> that

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
only downside i love that

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.320 
only downside i love that
if<00:02:14.380> there's<00:02:14.620> a<00:02:14.680> way<00:02:14.800> I<00:02:14.830> could<00:02:15.100> anybody<00:02:15.700> knows<00:02:16.300> a

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
opposed to this one I'd really

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.270 
opposed to this one I'd really
appreciate<00:02:19.180> it<00:02:19.600> but<00:02:20.170> if<00:02:20.470> not<00:02:20.680> this<00:02:20.980> camera

being able to have flash just kind of

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.120 
being able to have flash just kind of
neat<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:35.590> I<00:02:35.770> thought<00:02:35.890> that<00:02:36.010> was<00:02:36.100> pretty<00:02:36.220> cool
