a glue gun or any sort of glues that you
have<00:00:42.629> lying<00:00:43.260> around<00:00:43.520> so<00:00:44.520> when<00:00:44.940> installing

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
have lying around so when installing

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.590 
have lying around so when installing
this<00:00:45.870> make<00:00:46.680> sure<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:47.640> you're<00:00:48.059> not<00:00:48.210> blocking

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
this make sure that you're not blocking

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.680 
this make sure that you're not blocking
the<00:00:48.840> view<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.800> camera<00:00:50.120> so<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.270> best<00:00:51.449> way

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
the view of the camera so the best way

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.170 
the view of the camera so the best way
to<00:00:51.750> do<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.379> if<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.860> have<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:53.070> monitor<00:00:54.000> to

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
to do that is if you have a monitor to

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.069 
to do that is if you have a monitor to
see<00:00:54.329> if<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:54.960> hood<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:56.480> blocking<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.629> view<00:00:57.870> of

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
see if that hood is blocking the view of

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.959 
see if that hood is blocking the view of
the<00:00:58.640> camera<00:00:59.640> so<00:01:00.289> I<00:01:01.289> got<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.800> here<00:01:02.129> installed<00:01:02.640> so

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
the camera so I got it here installed so

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.109 
the camera so I got it here installed so
I'm<00:01:03.030> going<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.239> put<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.570> on<00:01:03.750> top<00:01:04.519> and<00:01:05.519> let's

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.179 
I'm going to put this on top and let's
see<00:01:06.330> if<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.689> will<00:01:06.810> be<00:01:06.869> blocking<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.680> view<00:01:07.920> of

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
see if that will be blocking the view of

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.420 
see if that will be blocking the view of
the<00:01:08.250> camera<00:01:09.049> so<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.080> looks<00:01:10.530> like<00:01:10.650> there's<00:01:11.100> no
