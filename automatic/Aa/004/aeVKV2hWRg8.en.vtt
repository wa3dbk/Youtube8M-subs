3<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:59.280> know<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.640> was<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.940> was<00:01:00.030> done<00:01:00.180> really

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
3 you know it was it was done really

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.119 
3 you know it was it was done really
well<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.840> was<00:01:00.960> very<00:01:00.989> simple<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.680> understand

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
well it was very simple to understand

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.369 
well it was very simple to understand
yet<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.510> rewards<00:01:03.899> for<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.140> were<00:01:04.199> very

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
yet the rewards for it were very

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.370 
yet the rewards for it were very
powerful<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.250> we<00:01:05.760> use<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:05.970> very<00:01:06.240> similar<00:01:06.930> system

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
powerful so we use a very similar system

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.050 
powerful so we use a very similar system
with<00:01:07.560> hunting<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.070> harpooning<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.850> for<00:01:09.000> our

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
with hunting and harpooning in for our

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.960 
with hunting and harpooning in for our
cry<00:01:09.210> 3<00:01:09.479> there<00:01:09.659> was<00:01:09.750> this<00:01:09.869> amazing<00:01:10.170> way<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.970> you

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
cry 3 there was this amazing way of you

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.520

getting<00:01:12.180> lost<00:01:12.450> in<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.780> world<00:01:12.869> maybe<00:01:13.350> you

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
getting lost in the world maybe you

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.410 
getting lost in the world maybe you
intended<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.010> go<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.369> do<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.490> mission<00:01:14.909> but

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
intended to go and do a mission but

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.690 
intended to go and do a mission but
along<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.869> way<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.979> did<00:01:17.130> some<00:01:17.280> hunting

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
along the way you you did some hunting

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.320 
along the way you you did some hunting
you<00:01:17.970> got<00:01:18.119> sidetracked<00:01:18.360> by<00:01:18.900> doing<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:20.000> race<00:01:21.000> and

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
you got sidetracked by doing a race and

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.719 
you got sidetracked by doing a race and
so<00:01:21.720> we<00:01:21.960> actually<00:01:22.350> were<00:01:22.650> inspired<00:01:23.070> by<00:01:23.159> this<00:01:23.310> to

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
so we actually were inspired by this to

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.179 
so we actually were inspired by this to
do<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.150> same<00:01:24.299> thing<00:01:24.479> back<00:01:24.689> like<00:01:24.930> alex<00:01:25.650> morales

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
do the same thing back like alex morales

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.580 
do the same thing back like alex morales
followed<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.610> up<00:01:26.670> with<00:01:26.790> another<00:01:27.299> question

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
followed that up with another question

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.289 
followed that up with another question
why<00:01:28.590> did<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.920> decide<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.310> include<00:01:29.850> the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
why did you decide to include the

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.850 
why did you decide to include the
mission<00:01:30.600> rating<00:01:30.780> feature<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.740> know

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
mission rating feature you know

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.170 
mission rating feature you know
internally<00:01:32.280> this<00:01:32.549> was<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.700> bit<00:01:32.909> contentious

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
internally this was a bit contentious

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.240 
internally this was a bit contentious
some<00:01:33.869> people<00:01:34.170> love<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.500> idea<00:01:34.740> some<00:01:34.979> people

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
some people love the idea some people

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.649 
some people love the idea some people
really<00:01:35.430> didn't<00:01:35.729> like<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.180> was<00:01:36.360> really<00:01:36.630> a

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
really didn't like it it was really a

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.380 
really didn't like it it was really a
way<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:36.990> have<00:01:37.409> people<00:01:38.340> be<00:01:38.520> able<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.909> give<00:01:39.060> some

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
way to have people be able to give some

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.359 
way to have people be able to give some

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
this mission worked because maybe the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.469 
this mission worked because maybe the
pacing<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.159> mechanics<00:01:50.640> use<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.060> writing<00:01:51.390> was

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
pacing the mechanics use the writing was

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.300 
pacing the mechanics use the writing was
great<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:51.899> if<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.530> mission<00:01:52.829> is<00:01:52.950> rated<00:01:53.220> very

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
great and if a mission is rated very

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.160 
great and if a mission is rated very
poorly<00:01:53.670> we<00:01:53.939> can<00:01:54.090> learn<00:01:54.180> from<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.479> as<00:01:54.630> well<00:01:54.659> so

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
poorly we can learn from that as well so

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.280 
poorly we can learn from that as well so

of that we have a huge progression

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.280 
of that we have a huge progression

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
system and the progression system is

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.010 
system and the progression system is
there<00:02:27.500> to<00:02:28.239> want<00:02:29.239> to<00:02:29.360> excite<00:02:29.600> you<00:02:29.720> to<00:02:29.840> fight

different ships and to have a scaling of

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.449 
different ships and to have a scaling of
challenge<00:02:32.750> but<00:02:33.170> also<00:02:33.380> it<00:02:33.830> was<00:02:33.980> a<00:02:34.010> way<00:02:34.190> for<00:02:34.220> us

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
challenge but also it was a way for us

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:35.559 
challenge but also it was a way for us
to<00:02:34.520> get<00:02:34.760> you<00:02:34.790> to<00:02:34.970> explore<00:02:35.209> all<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.540> different

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
islands because this world is really

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.220 
islands because this world is really
huge<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:37.610> we<00:02:37.700> wanted<00:02:37.940> exploration<00:02:38.540> to<00:02:38.690> be<00:02:38.720> one

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
huge and we wanted exploration to be one

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.750 
huge and we wanted exploration to be one
of<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.380> strongest<00:02:39.650> features<00:02:40.280> of<00:02:40.310> this<00:02:40.519> world

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
of the strongest features of this world

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.220 
of the strongest features of this world
we<00:02:41.030> put<00:02:41.180> a<00:02:41.209> lot<00:02:41.269> of<00:02:41.420> effort<00:02:41.750> to<00:02:41.870> make<00:02:42.019> sure<00:02:42.110> when

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
we put a lot of effort to make sure when

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.080 
we put a lot of effort to make sure when
we<00:02:42.320> spawn<00:02:42.560> these<00:02:42.739> ships<00:02:42.980> that<00:02:43.250> they'll<00:02:43.850> spawn

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
we spawn these ships that they'll spawn

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.780 
we spawn these ships that they'll spawn
in<00:02:44.300> very<00:02:44.780> interesting<00:02:45.290> formations<00:02:45.860> so<00:02:46.459> it's

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
in very interesting formations so it's

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.370 
in very interesting formations so it's
not<00:02:46.940> just<00:02:47.000> lone<00:02:47.330> ship<00:02:47.540> sometimes<00:02:47.989> they'll<00:02:48.230> be

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
not just lone ship sometimes they'll be

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.610 
not just lone ship sometimes they'll be
