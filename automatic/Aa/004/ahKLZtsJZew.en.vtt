00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:06.620
 hello today I'm going to teach you how to make points 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.929
 in class to decorate cakes or cookies 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.240
 already explain well the occasion that for 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:14.030
 make points in cookies we have to 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.650
 use a built class but for 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.240
 this time I will give you a trick that goes 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.710
 to improve a recipe really is 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.230
 when we make points especially in 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.660
 Cakes to decorate is not totally 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.720
 perfect and tried to arrange with a 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.380
 wet brush passing above the 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.590
 point 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.010
 we're going to miss this step the way 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.720
 I'm going to teach you how you can do 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.730
 these points will be much faster 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.940
 because we will not need to wet the 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.420
 point 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:47.019
 Well here I have the salle prepared 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.300
 it is very thick beige and to be able 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:52.870
 use it would have to be much more 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:56.649
 fluid but this time I'm going to lower it in 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.089
 instead of water with little corn syrup 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.640
 I should add little syrup 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:03.909
 corn and will make the glass already have 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.839
 a consistency like elastic very little 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:06.839
 we are going to take a little 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.850
 do not 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.170
 I have added iu syrup 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.070
 the consistency of the square 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.070
 has changed 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.720
 Now I'm going to give a little color to 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:45.240
 rules I liked to do it in white 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.650
 but as for you to see better how 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.909
 there are the points I get a little bit of 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.490
 color as I touch color 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:55.560
 I want very pale pink I will use a 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.560
 little coloring 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.530
 Y 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.920
 and now I'm going to mix well until 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.920
 I have a homogeneous color 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.659
 now I'm going to fill the pastry bag 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.810
 as in our fat in the points that 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:14.810
 I scored 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.330
 I'm going to put the fat points 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.540
 although we do not know it perfect 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.290
 They alone 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:43.700
 they recover their form starts at the tip and 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.100
 they get round that's because of the 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.900
 syrup 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.660
 House points were totally 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:54.090
 circular and do not need to retouch 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:56.519
 with brushes and wet climbs with water 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.200
 may be a tip but a few 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.200
 seconds it gets round 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.480
 with cookies the same thing happens 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.129
 I touched one of the points and see is 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.549
 Elastic comes back again and gets 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.549
 circular 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.550
 and we continue finishing the hairline 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.070
 because this would be the final result of 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.770
 work with our fat to have it 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:42.810
 have had corn syrup like that would be 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:45.090
 the pie a few very circular points 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.310
 and how many dating helps the last 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.099
 car formalities to make the cake 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.660
 as I have already told you better to use 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.819
 a mouthpiece of the number one of the most 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.890
 small to do the class points 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.050
 jazzy we work on cookies in 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.640
 horizontal then we can also use 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.290
 the number two 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.300
 although with the one of 1 is also very 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.900
 well thank you for being there and even the 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.900
 next video 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.830
 Y
