to it and if people want to recreate

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.330 
to it and if people want to recreate
this<00:02:18.870> pattern<00:02:19.260> will<00:02:19.290> have<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.800> instructions

pieces through you can certainly take

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.350 
pieces through you can certainly take
them<00:02:27.959> up<00:02:28.140> into<00:02:28.520> the<00:02:29.520> other<00:02:29.670> strands<00:02:30.090> if<00:02:30.270> you

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
them up into the other strands if you

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.020 
them up into the other strands if you
want<00:02:30.570> to<00:02:30.750> help<00:02:30.930> hold<00:02:31.260> them<00:02:31.520> and<00:02:32.520> how<00:02:32.850> do<00:02:32.910> you

want to help hold them and how do you

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.750 
want to help hold them and how do you
figure<00:02:33.390> out<00:02:33.540> how<00:02:33.870> tight<00:02:34.170> that<00:02:34.410> whole<00:02:34.890> melange

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
figure out how tight that whole melange

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.120 
figure out how tight that whole melange
needs<00:02:36.330> to<00:02:36.480> be<00:02:36.660> well<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.440> know<00:02:37.560> I've<00:02:37.770> kind<00:02:37.980> of

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
needs to be well you know I've kind of

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.500 
needs to be well you know I've kind of
keep<00:02:38.310> it<00:02:38.400> kind<00:02:38.550> of<00:02:38.640> loose<00:02:38.880> because<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.180> wanted

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510

to<00:02:39.600> have<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:39.750> draping<00:02:40.110> effect<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.830> it<00:02:40.860> but<00:02:41.730> I

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
to have a draping effect to it but I

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.820 
to have a draping effect to it but I
actually<00:02:42.390> want<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:42.989> just<00:02:43.200> be<00:02:43.290> able<00:02:43.350> to<00:02:43.470> make

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
actually want to just be able to make

actually want to just be able to make
sure<00:02:44.069> that<00:02:44.280> both<00:02:44.400> ends<00:02:45.030> are<00:02:45.209> equal<00:02:46.020> and

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
sure that both ends are equal and

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.190 
sure that both ends are equal and
there's<00:02:46.350> kind<00:02:46.650> of<00:02:46.709> a<00:02:46.910> tautness<00:02:47.910> to<00:02:48.390> it<00:02:48.570> you

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
there's kind of a tautness to it you

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.960 
there's kind of a tautness to it you
know<00:02:49.320> so<00:02:49.470> you<00:02:49.500> can<00:02:49.709> kind<00:02:49.920> of<00:02:49.950> keep<00:02:50.220> twisting<00:02:50.790> it

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
know so you can kind of keep twisting it

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.550 
know so you can kind of keep twisting it
and<00:02:51.000> adjusting<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:51.750> as<00:02:51.870> you<00:02:51.959> keep<00:02:52.140> adding<00:02:52.470> in

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
and adjusting and as you keep adding in

and adjusting and as you keep adding in
the<00:02:52.590> other<00:02:52.830> layers<00:02:53.100> it'll<00:02:53.459> help<00:02:53.700> adjust<00:02:54.630> and

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
the other layers it'll help adjust and

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.180 
the other layers it'll help adjust and
layer<00:02:55.830> up<00:02:56.100> these<00:02:56.480> other<00:02:57.480> strands<00:02:58.110> okay<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:58.920> I

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
layer up these other strands okay and I

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.070 
layer up these other strands okay and I
notice<00:02:59.580> you<00:02:59.700> just<00:02:59.880> removed<00:03:00.209> your<00:03:00.360> stopper<00:03:00.810> we

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
might should mention that's really

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.290 
might should mention that's really
important<00:03:02.580> when<00:03:02.670> you're<00:03:02.790> making<00:03:03.239> a

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
important when you're making a

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.120 
important when you're making a
multi-strand<00:03:03.870> design<00:03:04.200> like<00:03:04.410> this<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.830> keep

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
multi-strand design like this to keep

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.490 
multi-strand design like this to keep
your<00:03:05.310> strands<00:03:05.730> separated<00:03:06.360> it<00:03:06.870> really<00:03:07.110> helps

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
your strands separated it really helps

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.350 
your strands separated it really helps
so<00:03:07.680> much<00:03:07.890> just<00:03:08.250> so<00:03:08.370> you<00:03:08.459> can<00:03:08.670> really<00:03:08.910> have<00:03:09.209> them

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
so much just so you can really have them

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.420 
so much just so you can really have them
priest<00:03:09.989> brought<00:03:10.320> pretty<00:03:10.800> strong<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.280> be<00:03:11.370> able

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
priest brought pretty strong and be able

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.880 
priest brought pretty strong and be able
to<00:03:11.580> help<00:03:12.050> make<00:03:13.050> the<00:03:13.230> process<00:03:13.410> go<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.709> little

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
to help make the process go a little

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.940 
to help make the process go a little
faster<00:03:14.459> right<00:03:15.050> and<00:03:16.050> so<00:03:16.320> then<00:03:16.470> you'll<00:03:16.620> crimp

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
faster right and so then you'll crimp

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.030 
faster right and so then you'll crimp
this<00:03:17.220> one<00:03:17.400> on<00:03:17.550> to<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.910> jump<00:03:18.480> ring<00:03:18.720> I<00:03:18.959> will<00:03:19.530> and

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
this one on to the jump ring I will and

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.250 
this one on to the jump ring I will and
just<00:03:20.130> do<00:03:20.850> always<00:03:21.120> run<00:03:21.390> your<00:03:21.570> wire<00:03:21.840> back

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
just do always run your wire back

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.080 
just do always run your wire back
through<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.650> first<00:03:22.860> bead<00:03:23.070> I<00:03:23.310> do<00:03:23.459> because<00:03:24.060> I

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
through the first bead I do because I

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.479 
through the first bead I do because I
like<00:03:24.360> to<00:03:24.390> it's<00:03:25.110> for<00:03:25.680> me<00:03:25.799> it's<00:03:26.010> probably<00:03:26.280> like<00:03:26.459> a

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
like to it's for me it's probably like a

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.819 
like to it's for me it's probably like a
safety<00:03:26.790> mechanism<00:03:27.090> that<00:03:28.079> I<00:03:28.140> really<00:03:28.530> want<00:03:28.739> to

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
safety mechanism that I really want to

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.350 
safety mechanism that I really want to
be<00:03:28.920> able<00:03:28.980> to<00:03:29.100> make<00:03:29.160> sure<00:03:29.370> it's<00:03:29.549> really<00:03:29.730> secure

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
be able to make sure it's really secure

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.699 
be able to make sure it's really secure
and<00:03:30.660> then<00:03:30.780> sometimes<00:03:31.260> they<00:03:31.470> get<00:03:31.590> a<00:03:31.650> little

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
and then sometimes they get a little

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.190 
and then sometimes they get a little
snug<00:03:32.370> they<00:03:32.970> don't<00:03:33.150> always<00:03:33.329> know<00:03:33.660> sometimes

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
snug they don't always know sometimes

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.500 
snug they don't always know sometimes
you<00:03:34.290> have<00:03:34.320> to<00:03:34.500> remit<00:03:34.860> probably<00:03:35.370> yes<00:03:35.760> a<00:03:36.150> really

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
you have to remit probably yes a really

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.330 
you have to remit probably yes a really
weighty<00:03:36.720> piece<00:03:37.079> it<00:03:37.530> is<00:03:37.769> a<00:03:37.799> pretty<00:03:38.070> weighty

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
weighty piece it is a pretty weighty

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.740 
weighty piece it is a pretty weighty
piece<00:03:38.670> so<00:03:39.000> that's<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.239> reason<00:03:39.450> I<00:03:39.510> kind<00:03:39.720> of

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
piece so that's the reason I kind of

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.130 
piece so that's the reason I kind of
used<00:03:39.930> a<00:03:40.049> little<00:03:40.170> bit<00:03:40.230> larger<00:03:40.410> jump<00:03:40.860> rings<00:03:41.160> and

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
used a little bit larger jump rings and

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.350 
used a little bit larger jump rings and
and<00:03:43.220> then<00:03:44.220> just<00:03:44.549> to<00:03:44.610> be<00:03:44.700> able<00:03:44.760> to<00:03:44.910> kind<00:03:45.060> of<00:03:45.120> have

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
and then just to be able to kind of have

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.199 
and then just to be able to kind of have
some<00:03:46.019> balance<00:03:46.410> at<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.560> sides<00:03:46.920> you're<00:03:47.880> just

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
some balance at the sides you're just

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.970 
some balance at the sides you're just
gonna<00:03:48.360> take<00:03:48.570> it<00:03:48.600> then<00:03:49.290> of<00:03:49.410> course<00:03:49.650> when<00:03:49.799> your

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
gonna take it then of course when your

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.350 
gonna take it then of course when your
crimping<00:03:50.280> with<00:03:50.489> the<00:03:50.579> crystals<00:03:51.000> you<00:03:51.120> always

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
crimping with the crystals you always

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.569 
crimping with the crystals you always
need<00:03:51.540> to<00:03:51.660> watch<00:03:52.200> out<00:03:52.440> right<00:03:52.860> and<00:03:53.280> keep<00:03:53.400> it

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
need to watch out right and keep it

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:54.949 
need to watch out right and keep it
along<00:03:53.970> you<00:03:54.090> have<00:03:54.180> to<00:03:54.299> watch<00:03:54.540> this<00:03:54.720> little<00:03:54.870> jump

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
along you have to watch this little jump

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.050 
along you have to watch this little jump
rings<00:03:55.260> too<00:03:55.500> because<00:03:55.709> I'd<00:03:55.799> like<00:03:55.920> to<00:03:56.070> High<00:03:56.850> dance

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
rings too because I'd like to High dance

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.300 
rings too because I'd like to High dance
done<00:03:57.329> it<00:03:57.420> in<00:03:57.480> there<00:03:57.630> yeah<00:03:58.160> so<00:03:59.160> we're<00:03:59.280> just

okay like that and you can certainly add

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.810 
okay like that and you can certainly add
some<00:04:03.840> crimp<00:04:04.049> covers<00:04:04.410> to<00:04:04.650> it<00:04:04.739> if<00:04:04.829> you<00:04:04.860> want<00:04:05.220> and

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
some crimp covers to it if you want and

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.229 
some crimp covers to it if you want and
we<00:04:06.810> just<00:04:07.019> robbed<00:04:07.290> our<00:04:07.470> ancestral<00:04:08.010> are<00:04:08.220> so<00:04:08.910> you

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
we just robbed our ancestral are so you

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.810 
we just robbed our ancestral are so you
start<00:04:09.480> to<00:04:09.570> see<00:04:09.780> that<00:04:09.989> it's<00:04:10.170> it's<00:04:10.620> filling<00:04:11.579> in

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
start to see that it's it's filling in

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.460 
start to see that it's it's filling in
and<00:04:12.090> then<00:04:12.600> you<00:04:12.720> come<00:04:12.900> in<00:04:12.930> with<00:04:13.049> your<00:04:13.290> next

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
and then you come in with your next

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.279 
and then you come in with your next
strand<00:04:13.799> you<00:04:14.070> do<00:04:14.250> the<00:04:14.400> same<00:04:14.549> thing<00:04:14.609> but<00:04:15.260> what<00:04:16.260> I

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
strand you do the same thing but what I

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:19.190 
strand you do the same thing but what I
like<00:04:16.530> to<00:04:16.680> do<00:04:16.919> is<00:04:16.950> actually<00:04:17.299> stagger<00:04:18.299> the<00:04:18.989> but

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
like to do is actually stagger the but

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.979 
like to do is actually stagger the but
the<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:20.100> twist<00:04:20.370> so<00:04:20.669> ons<00:04:20.910> so<00:04:21.570> that<00:04:21.720> way<00:04:21.810> they'll

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
the the twist so ons so that way they'll

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.690 
the the twist so ons so that way they'll
lay<00:04:22.200> into<00:04:22.470> different<00:04:22.800> sections<00:04:23.010> of<00:04:23.370> the<00:04:23.550> neck

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
lay into different sections of the neck

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:24.980 
lay into different sections of the neck
that<00:04:23.880> makes<00:04:24.090> sense<00:04:24.330> when<00:04:24.690> it's<00:04:24.840> all<00:04:24.960> finished

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
that makes sense when it's all finished

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.270 
that makes sense when it's all finished
and<00:04:25.500> done

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
and done

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.920 
and done
so<00:04:26.490> you<00:04:26.880> just<00:04:27.030> kind<00:04:27.120> of<00:04:27.210> come<00:04:27.389> in<00:04:27.540> and<00:04:27.750> again

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
so you just kind of come in and again

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.920 
so you just kind of come in and again
you<00:04:28.050> just<00:04:28.080> keep<00:04:28.380> primping<00:04:29.510> it's<00:04:30.510> all<00:04:30.720> about

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
you just keep primping it's all about

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.270 
you just keep primping it's all about
kind<00:04:31.200> of<00:04:31.260> setting<00:04:31.500> up<00:04:31.560> whatever<00:04:31.800> pattern<00:04:32.160> you

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
kind of setting up whatever pattern you

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.920 
kind of setting up whatever pattern you
want<00:04:32.580> however<00:04:33.030> you<00:04:33.210> want<00:04:33.360> to<00:04:33.420> mix<00:04:33.540> and<00:04:33.750> match

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
want however you want to mix and match

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.500 
want however you want to mix and match
it<00:04:33.960> and<00:04:34.290> you<00:04:34.380> know<00:04:34.950> just<00:04:35.180> there's<00:04:36.180> so<00:04:36.389> many

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
it and you know just there's so many

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.420 
it and you know just there's so many
creative<00:04:36.750> options<00:04:37.139> oh<00:04:37.530> yeah<00:04:37.889> I<00:04:37.919> could<00:04:38.250> see

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
creative options oh yeah I could see

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.010 
creative options oh yeah I could see
this<00:04:38.550> in<00:04:38.730> a<00:04:38.790> lot<00:04:38.820> of<00:04:39.060> different<00:04:39.180> color<00:04:39.600> palette

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
this in a lot of different color palette

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.260 
this in a lot of different color palette
oh<00:04:40.139> absolutely<00:04:40.560> and<00:04:41.340> I<00:04:41.790> love<00:04:41.970> the<00:04:42.120> way<00:04:42.240> that

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
oh absolutely and I love the way that

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.879 
oh absolutely and I love the way that
you<00:04:42.450> made<00:04:42.690> it<00:04:42.810> adjustable<00:04:43.290> so<00:04:43.620> it<00:04:43.710> could

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
you made it adjustable so it could

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.740 
you made it adjustable so it could
really<00:04:44.040> go<00:04:44.280> from<00:04:44.520> day<00:04:44.820> to<00:04:44.880> night<00:04:44.970> yeah<00:04:45.600> it

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
really go from day to night yeah it

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:46.670 
really go from day to night yeah it
could<00:04:45.930> make<00:04:46.080> it<00:04:46.230> look<00:04:46.350> really<00:04:46.560> different

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
could make it look really different

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.040 
could make it look really different

depending on your outfit right so what I
kind<00:04:49.350> of<00:04:49.410> did<00:04:49.620> at<00:04:49.740> the<00:04:49.860> very<00:04:50.100> end<00:04:50.370> is<00:04:50.700> I

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
kind of did at the very end is I

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.450 
kind of did at the very end is I
actually<00:04:51.780> took<00:04:52.080> some<00:04:52.290> ribbon<00:04:52.680> in<00:04:52.919> this<00:04:53.190> case

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
actually took some ribbon in this case

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.360 
actually took some ribbon in this case
and<00:04:53.850> just<00:04:54.750> kind<00:04:54.930> of<00:04:54.990> took<00:04:55.680> it<00:04:55.889> right<00:04:56.100> through

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
and just kind of took it right through

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.930 
and just kind of took it right through
here<00:04:56.820> through<00:04:56.850> our<00:04:57.240> loop<00:04:57.919> and<00:04:58.919> you<00:04:59.640> just<00:04:59.790> kind

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
here through our loop and you just kind

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.210 
here through our loop and you just kind
of<00:04:59.970> pull<00:05:00.180> it<00:05:00.330> through<00:05:00.600> and<00:05:00.990> then<00:05:01.830> you<00:05:01.950> can<00:05:02.100> kind

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
of pull it through and then you can kind

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.040 
of pull it through and then you can kind
of<00:05:02.370> create<00:05:02.520> again<00:05:03.060> a<00:05:03.300> nice<00:05:03.480> i'm<00:05:03.690> going<00:05:03.810> to<00:05:03.870> cut

of create again a nice i'm going to cut

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.330 
of create again a nice i'm going to cut
off<00:05:04.169> some<00:05:04.200> sections<00:05:04.800> so<00:05:04.890> you're<00:05:05.040> going<00:05:05.130> to<00:05:05.220> do

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
off some sections so you're going to do

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.159 
off some sections so you're going to do
an<00:05:05.460> overhand<00:05:05.910> knot<00:05:06.150> I'm<00:05:06.540> going<00:05:06.780> to<00:05:06.870> just<00:05:07.020> do<00:05:07.140> a

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
an overhand knot I'm going to just do a

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.800 
an overhand knot I'm going to just do a
simple<00:05:07.470> overhand<00:05:08.040> knot<00:05:08.460> and<00:05:09.300> we'll<00:05:09.480> just<00:05:09.630> kind

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
simple overhand knot and we'll just kind

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.750 
simple overhand knot and we'll just kind
of<00:05:09.840> cut<00:05:10.110> it<00:05:10.290> and<00:05:10.530> you<00:05:10.950> can<00:05:11.100> do<00:05:11.310> it<00:05:11.460> where<00:05:11.610> it

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
of cut it and you can do it where it

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.950 
of cut it and you can do it where it
loops<00:05:11.970> over<00:05:12.180> and<00:05:12.510> twist<00:05:13.260> off<00:05:13.440> at<00:05:13.620> one<00:05:13.770> side<00:05:14.960> or

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
loops over and twist off at one side or

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.230 
loops over and twist off at one side or
you<00:05:16.350> can<00:05:16.500> take<00:05:16.740> in<00:05:16.890> due<00:05:17.190> to<00:05:17.340> particular<00:05:17.700> you

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
you can take in due to particular you

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.330 
you can take in due to particular you
know<00:05:18.330> two<00:05:18.390> different<00:05:18.960> sides<00:05:19.229> but<00:05:20.010> it<00:05:20.100> kind<00:05:20.280> of

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
know two different sides but it kind of

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.030 
know two different sides but it kind of
just<00:05:20.490> tugs<00:05:21.479> and<00:05:21.840> then<00:05:22.320> sometimes<00:05:22.620> even<00:05:22.890> just

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
just tugs and then sometimes even just

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.460 
just tugs and then sometimes even just
an<00:05:23.100> extra<00:05:23.430> little<00:05:23.550> loop<00:05:23.850> and<00:05:24.210> then<00:05:25.110> you<00:05:25.260> pull

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
an extra little loop and then you pull

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.850 
an extra little loop and then you pull
it<00:05:25.590> back<00:05:25.770> and<00:05:26.250> you<00:05:26.310> bring<00:05:26.700> it<00:05:26.790> over<00:05:27.710> to<00:05:28.710> this

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
it back and you bring it over to this

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.380 
it back and you bring it over to this
I'm<00:05:29.040> gonna<00:05:29.130> pulled<00:05:29.340> us<00:05:29.430> over<00:05:29.580> here<00:05:30.030> that's

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
I'm gonna pulled us over here that's

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.659 
I'm gonna pulled us over here that's
okay<00:05:30.750> oh<00:05:31.050> she's<00:05:31.560> dead<00:05:31.770> matter<00:05:32.160> I<00:05:32.250> let<00:05:32.460> me<00:05:32.550> know

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
okay oh she's dead matter I let me know

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:34.610 
okay oh she's dead matter I let me know
so<00:05:32.970> to<00:05:33.030> the<00:05:33.180> way<00:05:33.300> out<00:05:33.479> and<00:05:34.110> said<00:05:34.320> that<00:05:34.350> way<00:05:34.560> it

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
so to the way out and said that way it

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.130 
so to the way out and said that way it
makes<00:05:34.710> a<00:05:35.100> little<00:05:35.220> bit<00:05:35.370> easier<00:05:35.700> to<00:05:35.729> see<00:05:35.990> we<00:05:36.990> can

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140 
makes a little bit easier to see we can

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.140 
makes a little bit easier to see we can
know<00:05:37.260> this<00:05:37.470> yeah<00:05:37.710> down<00:05:38.190> and<00:05:38.610> we'll<00:05:38.790> do<00:05:38.970> well

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
know this yeah down and we'll do well

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.909 
know this yeah down and we'll do well
take<00:05:39.300> this<00:05:39.390> and<00:05:39.540> we'll<00:05:39.630> pretend<00:05:39.800> that<00:05:40.800> we've

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
take this and we'll pretend that we've

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:43.219 
take this and we'll pretend that we've
already<00:05:41.070> got<00:05:41.280> that<00:05:41.400> strong<00:05:41.640> online<00:05:41.850> and<00:05:42.240> then

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
already got that strong online and then

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:44.600 
already got that strong online and then
you<00:05:43.350> take<00:05:43.470> this<00:05:43.650> and<00:05:43.710> just<00:05:43.860> loop<00:05:44.130> it<00:05:44.250> over<00:05:44.340> to

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
you take this and just loop it over to

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.219 
you take this and just loop it over to
the<00:05:44.700> other<00:05:44.789> side<00:05:45.030> just<00:05:45.720> like<00:05:45.780> what<00:05:45.990> we<00:05:46.020> did

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
the other side just like what we did

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:48.409 
the other side just like what we did
right<00:05:46.410> there<00:05:46.580> this<00:05:47.580> is<00:05:47.729> so<00:05:47.910> pretty<00:05:48.090> and<00:05:48.330> so

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:48.419 
right there this is so pretty and so

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:50.120 
right there this is so pretty and so
this<00:05:48.660> is<00:05:48.840> giving<00:05:49.020> you<00:05:49.169> an<00:05:49.320> asymmetrical

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.130 
this is giving you an asymmetrical

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.100 
this is giving you an asymmetrical
effect<00:05:50.729> but<00:05:50.910> you<00:05:51.030> could<00:05:51.180> also<00:05:51.330> i<00:05:51.720> think<00:05:51.810> what

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
effect but you could also i think what

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.180 
effect but you could also i think what
you're<00:05:52.229> saying<00:05:52.530> was<00:05:52.680> that<00:05:52.710> you<00:05:52.919> could<00:05:53.039> also

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
you're saying was that you could also

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.820 
you're saying was that you could also
tie<00:05:53.460> it<00:05:53.520> in<00:05:53.669> the<00:05:53.700> back<00:05:53.910> right<00:05:54.570> tire<00:05:55.080> back<00:05:55.470> story

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
tie it in the back right tire back story
