00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.779
 hello to all kids here I saw the crash 10 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.840
 and good today I bring you a new video in 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:11.929
 which is the special Christmas and you 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.929
 I bring a boxing voucher or a boxing of a 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:18.349
 playstation 3 control or a command that 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:20.300
 called scoop and good is that game in is 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:21.619
 where I bought it is worth the 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.689
 better pages where you can get 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.050
 these controls and I think the only one that 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.050
 I know 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:32.480
 in a moment we open and here you see the 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.490
 command what are you going to see now here says 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.280
 scott gaming you see the control and good 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.720
 because a scoop control is characterized by 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.100
 the two levers he has the command 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.989
 back there you see it in the small photo 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.790
 because the command from behind has two 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.160
 levers and is a knob that is used 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.070
 mainly for competitive then 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:53.210
 well let's see it to ebay was sent 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.860
 we'll get him good and I'm worth 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.440
 explain a little that brings this command 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.300
 It is worth oiling the good because it is a 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.640
 normal command, I'll keep it in 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.860
 yellow and behind black and white 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.720
 then he is quite handsome and the 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.020
 you have in many colors is worth then 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.369
 well the buttons these of these 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.470
 buttons the triangle the square the 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.420
 The circle is made as the 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.399
 mate as in matte paint then 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.290
 Well, even if they get wet because they raise you 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:20.600
 hands a little if they dry at all 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.590
 so then I flip with that the truth 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.540
 then there is the start and the sail start and 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.180
 the select are tucked in for worth 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.590
 look, I do not know if you see it, they are like a little 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.300
 put inside so that it does not affect 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.140
 almost nothing in command like this 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.390
 button here 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.159
 on the playstation button it is 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.470
 also like getting inside I do not know 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.720
 if you can appreciate it well there 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.330
 then we went to the joysticks the two 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:48.770
 joysticks 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:50.900
 they have a different touch to that of a 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.390
 of any command of ps3 is worth 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.830
 they have a touch in which equal 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.990
 that the buttons even if they sound like 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.030
 hands practically dry 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.850
 instantly then well it is 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.100
 something that goes pretty well and good 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.450
 this is also normal this I do not think 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.940
 that nothing has changed in this is worth 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.220
 hardly use it and this only good 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.810
 would do the main part that apart 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.420
 you also have this here that you see in 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.400
 yellow I put a double layer of 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.820
 paint you are going to choose then then what 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.190
 I put then then to the equally for 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.780
 that the control will hold you better at hand and 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.760
 that do not run off and nothing then 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.769
 Well, good, pretty good, then it's worth 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.070
 is a paint that was previously slippery 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:33.590
 so say it then on top well then 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.410
 up here you see nothing to load the 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.590
 command and here put the scoop page 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.349
 it's worth the scu I do not know what 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.670
 with her young and good here we have 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:50.130
 likewise the l1 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:51.810
 l 2 lr 1 and ll r1 and r2 is worth then 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.940
 well, the top part is 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.650
 exactly the same goes there does not change 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.959
 nothing the bad thing is that I have my hands 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.520
 quite big then how do I have the 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.020
 pretty big hand I do not know if you can 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.690
 see in the video there are many times that 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.610
 I'm playing and instead of giving the 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.980
 shoot because I can not play like that 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.810
 then I play like that then many 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.380
 times instead of giving the one to shoot him 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.269
 I give here to here just then I do not 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.630
 shoot and it took a lot to shoot is 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.890
 the bad thing about having the biggest fingers 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.160
 rather larger than the command but 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.600
 well , nothing happens. 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.190
 few times then well it does not happen 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.980
 nothing and now let's see what 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.500
 really have the scoop then 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.330
 well we go to the back and 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.400
 You can order this or you can not ask 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.709
 you can put the ones I do not think you 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.910
 It's worth about three euros more then 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.069
 Well, it's really worth it 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.959
 because from behind it's like rubber has the 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.660
 I command like rubber in which and you 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.440
 you take control and it does not escape 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.600
 yes almost impossible to escape 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.910
 then well you touch it and this 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.720
 it's like rubber is really cool a lot of 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.640
 true 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.680
 I recommend this layer of paint in 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.600
 white so that you do not get caught up and 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.940
 rival the command and well we go to the 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:04.030
 levers the two levers is here 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.830
 the excuses and this 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.770
 ok because they have these two 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.270
 levers good I told you this command 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.860
 is to play competitive there you see it 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.860
 look i'm going to lift this 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.440
 just a moment 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.299
 I'm going to lift this part of here for 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.880
 that you see this little button you are 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.680
 seeing the button that black is not worth it 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.030
 the black button is the one that is the button 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.130
 principal what happens that you give to the 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.110
 lever and it gives the black button that 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.780
 you just saw it worth then well then 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:37.389
 what happens if you play with default 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.700
 you are like that playing then you put 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:40.870
 these fingers and put your finger here and the 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.690
 another is also worth what happens that no 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.760
 I have the camera in the other in the other 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:49.480
 hand then well you are here and 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.610
 if you go with default to this one to this 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:55.540
 here you jump to the one on the left you jump 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:58.870
 with default already here and I'm 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.310
 here you're worthless and you're buried for the 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.160
 Tomb expulsion sheet if you crouch 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.330
 so good this command because it is 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.130
 for competitive you already know that in 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.380
 competitive if you have played you are 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.660
 playing right now in competitive is 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.919
 hard enough to win there are many people 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.100
 which is very good and such then you have to 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:17.350
 to improve and well, three seconds 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.930
 they can give you the victory then 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.419
 good instead of having to be from 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.800
 that you are here playing and I am 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:25.750
 I use default jump and 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.640
 crouch down to these two as having 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.770
 touching it because it took a lot 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.780
 less than doing that then then 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.850
 good and you win a lot against 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.740
 some really I thought it would take 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.180
 enough to get used to and I have not 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.669
 taken practically almost nothing in 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.440
 get used then well what 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.510
 I recommend 100% really I think 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.640
 maybe I worth but when 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.860
 I'm trying it, it was worth the 80 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.930
 and 80 was with this command then 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.060
 Well, I really recommend it 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.500
 ones against ones you want very much and good 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.630
 if you use the tactical configuration is 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.310
 what people use most to this one 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.040
 I would continue to skip this and not 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:02.890
 changes nothing but instead of this one instead 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.930
 of this one, to kick you up , it's worth 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.580
 so then well here you see listen 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.130
 on the only page I'll leave it on the 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.390
 description since it is the best and they are a 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.790
 little expensive but really controls 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:14.560
 They rent me, they are worth it. 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:16.150
 I recommend and well I hope that I have 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.160
 liked this a boxing the first one in 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.780
