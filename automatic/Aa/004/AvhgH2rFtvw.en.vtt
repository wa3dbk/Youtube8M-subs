00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
freakin truck parts all this stuff could

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.720 
freakin truck parts all this stuff could
have<00:03:00.170> been<00:03:00.260> put<00:03:00.470> right<00:03:00.500> back<00:03:00.710> in<00:03:01.220> and<00:03:01.340> reused

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
have been put right back in and reused

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.970 
have been put right back in and reused
but<00:03:02.150> there's<00:03:02.450> so<00:03:02.660> many<00:03:02.840> parts<00:03:03.260> so<00:03:03.770> many
