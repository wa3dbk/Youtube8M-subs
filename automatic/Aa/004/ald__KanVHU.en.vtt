00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
very back of the boat let's use some

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.810 
very back of the boat let's use some
flash<00:01:12.189> cards<00:01:13.200> if<00:01:14.200> you're<00:01:15.070> looking<00:01:15.460> at<00:01:15.640> the

flash cards if you're looking at the

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
transom of a boat and you see this it's

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.889 
transom of a boat and you see this it's
a<00:01:18.100> flat<00:01:18.340> bottom<00:01:18.700> boat<00:01:18.909> there's<00:01:19.299> no<00:01:19.450> V<00:01:19.630> at<00:01:19.750> all

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 
a flat bottom boat there's no V at all

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:22.050 
a flat bottom boat there's no V at all
it's<00:01:20.289> very<00:01:20.380> stable<00:01:20.770> but<00:01:21.549> it's<00:01:21.670> pretty<00:01:21.789> bumpy

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
it's very stable but it's pretty bumpy

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.539 
it's very stable but it's pretty bumpy
and<00:01:22.210> wet<00:01:23.460> now<00:01:24.460> if<00:01:25.270> you<00:01:25.450> see<00:01:25.600> this<00:01:26.079> it's<00:01:26.920> a<00:01:27.130> semi

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
and wet now if you see this it's a semi
