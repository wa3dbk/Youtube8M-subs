briefly we just want to familiarize you

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.810 
briefly we just want to familiarize you
guys<00:00:22.050> with<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.860> new<00:00:23.099> remote<00:00:23.369> because<00:00:23.700> there

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
guys with the new remote because there

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.580 
guys with the new remote because there
are<00:00:23.910> some<00:00:24.090> changes<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:24.509> we<00:00:24.570> made<00:00:24.750> I'm<00:00:25.500> a

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
are some changes that we made I'm a

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.620 
are some changes that we made I'm a
previous<00:00:25.920> model<00:00:26.220> remote<00:00:26.430> seen<00:00:27.119> here<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.480> key

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
previous model remote seen here the key

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.979 
previous model remote seen here the key
fob<00:00:27.810> was<00:00:28.080> made<00:00:28.259> out<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.500> plastic<00:00:29.040> so<00:00:29.570> if<00:00:30.570> you

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:30.989 
fob was made out of plastic so if you

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:35.420 
fob was made out of plastic so if you
were<00:00:31.200> to<00:00:31.560> drop<00:00:32.279> this<00:00:32.550> step<00:00:33.149> on<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:34.070> roll<00:00:35.070> over

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
were to drop this step on it roll over

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.520 
were to drop this step on it roll over
it<00:00:35.730> would<00:00:36.090> break<00:00:36.329> obviously<00:00:37.170> pretty<00:00:37.320> easily

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
it would break obviously pretty easily

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.639 
it would break obviously pretty easily
the<00:00:38.399> new<00:00:38.640> remote<00:00:39.030> actually<00:00:39.300> has<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.690> stainless

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
the new remote actually has a stainless

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:41.870 
the new remote actually has a stainless
steel<00:00:40.680> chassis<00:00:40.980> on<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.399> so<00:00:41.489> it's<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.700> lot<00:00:41.850> more

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:41.880 
steel chassis on it so it's a lot more

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.020 
steel chassis on it so it's a lot more
rugged<00:00:42.329> than<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.469> previous<00:00:43.800> version<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.399> as

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
rugged than the previous version and as

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.459 
rugged than the previous version and as
an<00:00:45.149> added<00:00:45.390> little<00:00:45.480> safety<00:00:45.839> feature<00:00:46.109> it's<00:00:46.289> got

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
an added little safety feature it's got

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.889 
an added little safety feature it's got
this<00:00:46.679> cover<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.190> can<00:00:47.399> slide<00:00:47.730> up<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.329> protect

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899

little feature there the second thing
you'll<00:01:03.210> notice<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:04.500> box<00:01:04.920> itself<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.460> box

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
you'll notice is the box itself the box

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.890 
you'll notice is the box itself the box
is<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.240> lot<00:01:06.840> smaller<00:01:07.170> than<00:01:08.510> the<00:01:09.510> previous

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
is a lot smaller than the previous

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.320 
is a lot smaller than the previous
version<00:01:10.230> box<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.220> know<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.580> fraction

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
version box this is you know a fraction

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.930 
version box this is you know a fraction
size<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.229> for<00:01:13.950> some<00:01:14.100> people<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.430> wasn't<00:01:14.729> too

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
size and for some people it wasn't too

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.850 
size and for some people it wasn't too
important<00:01:15.300> but<00:01:15.450> for<00:01:15.780> guys<00:01:15.870> with<00:01:16.170> motorcycles

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
important but for guys with motorcycles

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.230 
important but for guys with motorcycles
or<00:01:17.040> with<00:01:17.159> vehicles<00:01:17.670> where<00:01:17.850> there's<00:01:18.000> not<00:01:18.120> a<00:01:18.180> lot

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
or with vehicles where there's not a lot

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.630 
or with vehicles where there's not a lot
of<00:01:18.390> room<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.660> do<00:01:18.750> install<00:01:19.400> shrinking<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.490> down

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
of room to do install shrinking it down

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.370 
of room to do install shrinking it down
as<00:01:20.730> much<00:01:20.760> as<00:01:20.940> possible<00:01:21.030> was<00:01:21.660> important<00:01:22.200> the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
as much as possible was important the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.720 
as much as possible was important the
next<00:01:22.650> thing<00:01:22.830> when<00:01:23.010> you<00:01:23.100> look<00:01:23.250> at<00:01:23.370> the<00:01:23.430> box

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:23.730 
next thing when you look at the box

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.460 
next thing when you look at the box
you'll<00:01:24.030> notice<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.420> all<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.870> wiring<00:01:25.290> is

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
you'll notice is that all the wiring is

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.640 
you'll notice is that all the wiring is
pre-installed<00:01:26.250> on<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.030> older<00:01:27.660> model<00:01:27.990> you

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
pre-installed on the older model you

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.430 
pre-installed on the older model you
actually<00:01:28.980> had<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.810> connector<00:01:30.810> here<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.380> you

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
actually had a connector here and you

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.260 
actually had a connector here and you
would<00:01:31.650> attach<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.370> wires<00:01:32.550> to<00:01:32.700> here<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.060> plug

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
would attach the wires to here and plug

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.690 
would attach the wires to here and plug
it<00:01:33.390> in<00:01:33.740> basically<00:01:34.740> just<00:01:34.950> did<00:01:35.190> away<00:01:35.370> with<00:01:35.400> some

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
it in basically just did away with some

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.450 
it in basically just did away with some
of<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.030> simplify<00:01:36.480> things<00:01:37.280> right<00:01:38.280> here

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
of that to simplify things right here

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.370 
of that to simplify things right here
you've<00:01:38.610> got<00:01:38.790> your<00:01:39.060> main<00:01:39.510> power<00:01:39.780> wire<00:01:39.840> it's

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
you've got your main power wire it's

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.170 
you've got your main power wire it's
fused<00:01:40.860> for<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.370> so<00:01:41.580> you<00:01:41.640> don't<00:01:41.790> have<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.030> go

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
fused for you so you don't have to go

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.830 
fused for you so you don't have to go
add<00:01:42.600> your<00:01:43.170> own<00:01:43.230> fuse<00:01:43.790> you<00:01:44.790> have<00:01:44.940> black<00:01:45.630> wire

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
add your own fuse you have black wire

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.320 
add your own fuse you have black wire
obviously<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.520> grounds<00:01:47.520> for<00:01:47.580> go<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.940> clean

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
obviously is grounds for go to a clean

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:55.270 
obviously is grounds for go to a clean
chassis<00:01:49.290> ground<00:01:50.330> the<00:01:51.620> wires<00:01:52.790> here

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
chassis ground the wires here

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.390 
chassis ground the wires here
and<00:01:55.400> here<00:01:55.910> are<00:01:56.090> your<00:01:56.350> output<00:01:57.350> wires<00:01:57.560> this

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
and here are your output wires this

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.490 
and here are your output wires this
would<00:01:58.610> go<00:01:58.760> to<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:59.150> actual<00:01:59.450> devices<00:01:59.870> that<00:02:00.320> you

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
would go to the actual devices that you

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.920 
would go to the actual devices that you
were<00:02:00.620> powering<00:02:00.920> up<00:02:01.070> and<00:02:01.510> there's<00:02:02.510> another<00:02:02.720> one

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
were powering up and there's another one

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
were powering up and there's another one
if<00:02:03.260> you<00:02:03.380> look<00:02:03.530> right<00:02:03.830> here<00:02:04.810> this<00:02:05.810> is<00:02:06.050> a<00:02:06.380> little

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
if you look right here this is a little

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.469 
if you look right here this is a little
hard<00:02:07.160> to<00:02:07.220> see<00:02:07.370> but<00:02:07.490> this<00:02:07.610> is<00:02:07.790> the<00:02:07.910> antenna<00:02:08.240> wire

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
hard to see but this is the antenna wire

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.560 
hard to see but this is the antenna wire
and<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:10.640> other<00:02:10.670> box<00:02:10.940> didn't<00:02:11.150> have<00:02:11.240> an<00:02:11.330> antenna

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
and the other box didn't have an antenna

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.620 
and the other box didn't have an antenna
line<00:02:11.750> that's<00:02:11.990> because<00:02:12.580> on<00:02:13.580> the<00:02:13.700> other<00:02:13.820> box<00:02:14.090> the

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
line that's because on the other box the

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.070 
line that's because on the other box the
antenna<00:02:14.930> was<00:02:15.050> actual<00:02:15.320> on<00:02:15.380> the<00:02:15.500> remote<00:02:15.709> so<00:02:17.080> some

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
antenna was actual on the remote so some

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.690 
antenna was actual on the remote so some
people<00:02:18.170> felt<00:02:18.410> that<00:02:18.620> was<00:02:18.740> a<00:02:18.770> little<00:02:18.830> a<00:02:19.130> little

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
people felt that was a little a little

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.070 
people felt that was a little a little
bit<00:02:19.790> old-school<00:02:20.060> so<00:02:20.510> we<00:02:20.630> did<00:02:20.780> it<00:02:20.810> with<00:02:20.990> the

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
bit old-school so we did it with the

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.260 
bit old-school so we did it with the
antenna<00:02:21.350> on<00:02:21.440> or<00:02:21.680> move<00:02:21.860> and<00:02:22.100> put<00:02:22.940> the<00:02:23.030> antenna

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
antenna on or move and put the antenna

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:32.839 
antenna on or move and put the antenna
on<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:23.420> box

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.039 

you<00:02:33.849> have<00:02:33.939> a<00:02:33.970> cool<00:02:34.239> feature<00:02:34.569> that<00:02:34.750> we<00:02:35.019> have

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
you have a cool feature that we have

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:39.869 
you have a cool feature that we have
here<00:02:35.470> is<00:02:35.650> that<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.970> remote<00:02:37.930> and<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:39.069> box<00:02:39.280> are

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 
here is that the remote and the box are

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:42.509 
here is that the remote and the box are
paired<00:02:40.840> and<00:02:40.989> frequency<00:02:41.439> we<00:02:41.769> had<00:02:41.890> some<00:02:42.099> issues

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
paired and frequency we had some issues

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.110 
paired and frequency we had some issues
where<00:02:42.730> if<00:02:43.409> you<00:02:44.409> had<00:02:44.620> a<00:02:44.650> remote<00:02:44.920> box<00:02:45.549> from<00:02:45.939> us

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
where if you had a remote box from us

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.449 
where if you had a remote box from us
and<00:02:46.329> your<00:02:47.319> neighbor<00:02:47.530> had<00:02:47.769> a<00:02:47.799> remote<00:02:48.069> box<00:02:48.280> from

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
and your neighbor had a remote box from

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.910 
and your neighbor had a remote box from
us<00:02:48.610> you<00:02:49.540> could<00:02:49.720> accidentally<00:02:50.200> turn<00:02:50.560> on<00:02:50.769> and

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
us you could accidentally turn on and

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.080 
us you could accidentally turn on and
off<00:02:51.390> your<00:02:52.390> your<00:02:52.840> neighbors<00:02:53.400> once<00:02:54.400> if<00:02:54.790> you<00:02:54.849> were

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
off your your neighbors once if you were

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.240 
off your your neighbors once if you were
in<00:02:55.180> close<00:02:55.390> enough<00:02:55.510> proximity<00:02:55.690> so<00:02:56.349> everything

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
in close enough proximity so everything

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.130 
in close enough proximity so everything
is<00:02:57.400> a<00:02:57.489> frequency<00:02:57.879> matched<00:02:58.150> you<00:02:58.720> don't<00:02:58.900> have<00:02:59.049> to

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
is a frequency matched you don't have to

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.420 
is a frequency matched you don't have to
keep<00:02:59.260> these<00:02:59.409> stickers<00:02:59.620> on<00:02:59.859> but<00:03:00.010> you<00:03:00.069> do<00:03:00.250> want

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
keep these stickers on but you do want

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.179 
keep these stickers on but you do want
to<00:03:00.459> make<00:03:00.579> a<00:03:00.640> note<00:03:01.000> of<00:03:01.180> your<00:03:01.870> frequency<00:03:02.739> on<00:03:02.980> your

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:03.189 
to make a note of your frequency on your

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:04.470 
to make a note of your frequency on your
controller<00:03:03.519> so<00:03:03.760> that<00:03:03.909> if<00:03:04.030> you<00:03:04.120> were<00:03:04.209> ever<00:03:04.359> to

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
controller so that if you were ever to

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.869 
controller so that if you were ever to
lose<00:03:04.720> your<00:03:04.959> controller<00:03:05.400> we<00:03:06.400> could<00:03:06.609> awfully

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
lose your controller we could awfully

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:08.369 
lose your controller we could awfully
say<00:03:07.090> with<00:03:07.299> on<00:03:07.480> that<00:03:07.659> what<00:03:07.900> would<00:03:08.230> match

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:08.379 
say with on that what would match

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:10.110 
say with on that what would match
through<00:03:08.590> them<00:03:08.709> save<00:03:08.890> your<00:03:09.069> controller<00:03:09.400> now

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
through them save your controller now

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.490 
through them save your controller now
let's<00:03:10.359> go<00:03:10.780> ahead<00:03:10.959> and<00:03:11.049> take<00:03:11.139> a<00:03:11.170> look<00:03:11.319> at<00:03:11.440> the

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
let's go ahead and take a look at the

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.690 
let's go ahead and take a look at the
actual<00:03:11.680> functionality<00:03:12.159> and<00:03:12.609> how<00:03:13.030> this<00:03:13.239> works

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
actual functionality and how this works

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
actual functionality and how this works
we're<00:03:15.700> gonna<00:03:15.760> go<00:03:16.000> through<00:03:16.269> the<00:03:16.389> remote

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
we're gonna go through the remote

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.349 
we're gonna go through the remote
functions<00:03:17.349> real<00:03:17.530> quick<00:03:17.940> we've<00:03:18.940> got<00:03:19.090> a<00:03:19.120> set<00:03:19.329> of

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
functions real quick we've got a set of

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:21.629 
functions real quick we've got a set of
headlights<00:03:19.510> here<00:03:19.840> with<00:03:19.930> halos<00:03:20.200> on<00:03:20.349> them<00:03:20.639> we're

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
headlights here with halos on them we're

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:23.339 
headlights here with halos on them we're
basically<00:03:22.269> going<00:03:22.480> to<00:03:22.629> show<00:03:22.780> you<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:23.200> two

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
basically going to show you the two

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.410 
basically going to show you the two
different<00:03:23.379> channels<00:03:24.069> not<00:03:24.909> that<00:03:25.150> you're<00:03:25.329> going

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
different channels not that you're going

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.970 
different channels not that you're going
to<00:03:25.480> want<00:03:25.690> to<00:03:25.720> put<00:03:25.930> two<00:03:26.349> different<00:03:26.470> headlights

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
to want to put two different headlights

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.890 
to want to put two different headlights
on<00:03:27.159> two<00:03:27.310> different<00:03:27.459> channels<00:03:27.840> this<00:03:28.840> is

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
on two different channels this is

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.199 
on two different channels this is
strictly<00:03:29.409> for<00:03:29.620> demonstration<00:03:30.579> purposes<00:03:31.000> to

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
strictly for demonstration purposes to

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.170 
strictly for demonstration purposes to
show<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:32.560> differences<00:03:33.010> why<00:03:33.310> not<00:03:33.519> when<00:03:34.090> we're

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
show the differences why not when we're

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.250 
show the differences why not when we're
using<00:03:34.299> two<00:03:34.540> different<00:03:34.659> channels<00:03:34.870> of<00:03:35.139> two

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
using two different channels of two

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.439 
using two different channels of two
different<00:03:35.440> functions<00:03:35.620> i<00:03:36.069> I'm<00:03:36.940> gonna<00:03:37.090> start<00:03:37.299> by

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:37.449 
different functions i I'm gonna start by

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:40.830 
different functions i I'm gonna start by
taking<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:38.349> well<00:03:39.220> let's<00:03:40.060> look<00:03:40.180> at<00:03:40.299> D<00:03:40.480> these

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
taking the well let's look at D these

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.000 
taking the well let's look at D these
still<00:03:41.109> going<00:03:41.260> to<00:03:41.319> be<00:03:41.379> the<00:03:41.470> same<00:03:41.620> thing<00:03:41.829> as<00:03:41.919> the

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
still going to be the same thing as the

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.379 
still going to be the same thing as the
other<00:03:42.129> remote<00:03:42.370> work<00:03:42.579> he's<00:03:42.849> going<00:03:43.000> to<00:03:43.060> control

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
other remote work he's going to control

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:47.220 
other remote work he's going to control
the<00:03:43.540> on/off<00:03:43.870> functionality<00:03:45.060> one<00:03:46.060> take<00:03:46.269> a<00:03:46.419> when

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
the on/off functionality one take a when

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.530 
the on/off functionality one take a when
a<00:03:47.260> press<00:03:47.590> and<00:03:47.859> hold<00:03:48.160> a<00:03:48.489> and<00:03:49.150> what<00:03:49.299> that's<00:03:49.449> going

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
a press and hold a and what that's going

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.460 
a press and hold a and what that's going
to<00:03:49.599> do<00:03:49.720> is<00:03:49.810> that's<00:03:49.870> going<00:03:50.019> to<00:03:50.109> activate<00:03:50.260> the

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
to do is that's going to activate the

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.349 
to do is that's going to activate the
dimmer<00:03:50.709> this<00:03:51.639> dimmer<00:03:51.879> actually<00:03:52.209> has<00:03:52.329> a

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
dimmer this dimmer actually has a

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:55.680 
dimmer this dimmer actually has a
hundred<00:03:52.780> steps<00:03:53.699> between<00:03:54.699> Dimond<00:03:55.239> by<00:03:55.540> you

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
hundred steps between Dimond by you

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.150 
hundred steps between Dimond by you
rather<00:03:55.959> than<00:03:56.139> six<00:03:56.410> steps<00:03:56.680> like<00:03:56.799> the<00:03:56.949> old

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
rather than six steps like the old

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.520 
rather than six steps like the old
controller<00:03:57.730> it<00:03:58.480> looks<00:03:58.660> a<00:03:58.750> little<00:03:58.959> bit<00:03:59.199> funny

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
controller it looks a little bit funny

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.189 
controller it looks a little bit funny
on<00:03:59.889> camera<00:03:59.949> and<00:04:00.730> it's<00:04:01.359> watering<00:04:01.810> a<00:04:01.840> little<00:04:02.049> bit

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:02.199 
on camera and it's watering a little bit

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:04.140 
on camera and it's watering a little bit
but<00:04:02.379> in<00:04:02.470> person<00:04:02.680> this<00:04:03.370> is<00:04:03.489> a<00:04:03.549> pretty<00:04:03.760> smooth

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
but in person this is a pretty smooth

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.789 
but in person this is a pretty smooth
transition<00:04:05.010> and<00:04:06.010> once<00:04:06.190> we<00:04:06.340> find<00:04:06.819> they<00:04:07.769> find<00:04:08.769> a

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
transition and once we find they find a

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.319 
transition and once we find they find a
setting<00:04:08.980> that<00:04:09.099> we're<00:04:09.250> happy<00:04:09.370> with<00:04:09.609> we<00:04:09.730> get<00:04:09.849> at

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
setting that we're happy with we get at

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.229 
setting that we're happy with we get at
least<00:04:10.359> let's<00:04:10.780> go<00:04:10.870> ahead<00:04:11.079> and<00:04:11.430> turn<00:04:12.430> these<00:04:12.609> all

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
least let's go ahead and turn these all

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.629 
least let's go ahead and turn these all
the<00:04:13.419> way<00:04:13.480> back<00:04:13.720> up<00:04:14.010> so<00:04:15.010> that's<00:04:15.129> a<00:04:15.400> and

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:15.639 
the way back up so that's a and

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:16.979 
the way back up so that's a and
basically<00:04:15.909> I<00:04:16.000> could<00:04:16.150> also<00:04:16.269> take<00:04:16.479> a<00:04:16.539> if<00:04:16.930> I

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
basically I could also take a if I

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.449 
basically I could also take a if I
wanted<00:04:17.199> to<00:04:17.260> turn<00:04:17.440> off<00:04:17.590> one<00:04:17.739> of<00:04:17.769> the<00:04:17.889> channels<00:04:18.280> I

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
wanted to turn off one of the channels I

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.599 
wanted to turn off one of the channels I
can<00:04:19.209> not<00:04:20.109> press<00:04:20.409> and<00:04:20.590> hold<00:04:20.739> but<00:04:20.919> just<00:04:21.070> press<00:04:21.370> a

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
can not press and hold but just press a

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.460 
can not press and hold but just press a
and<00:04:21.820> that<00:04:21.970> would<00:04:22.030> turn<00:04:22.240> off<00:04:22.419> in<00:04:23.139> this<00:04:23.289> case

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
and that would turn off in this case

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.920 
and that would turn off in this case
turn<00:04:24.010> off<00:04:24.130> when<00:04:24.970> we<00:04:25.060> have<00:04:25.210> our<00:04:25.360> left<00:04:25.570> headlight

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
turn off when we have our left headlight

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.600 
turn off when we have our left headlight
set<00:04:26.289> on<00:04:26.409> we'll<00:04:26.979> call<00:04:27.130> it<00:04:27.220> channel<00:04:27.520> a

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
set on we'll call it channel a

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.580 
set on we'll call it channel a
and<00:04:28.850> the<00:04:29.240> facility<00:04:29.630> I'll<00:04:29.840> turn<00:04:30.050> off<00:04:30.170> channel<00:04:30.470> B

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
and the facility I'll turn off channel B

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.530 
and the facility I'll turn off channel B
and<00:04:30.710> turn<00:04:30.860> on<00:04:31.010> channel<00:04:31.340> a<00:04:31.460> and<00:04:31.730> then<00:04:32.240> press<00:04:32.420> it

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
and turn on channel a and then press it

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.120 
and turn on channel a and then press it
a<00:04:32.600> third<00:04:32.630> time<00:04:32.780> turn<00:04:33.200> on<00:04:33.230> both<00:04:33.440> channels<00:04:33.680> so

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
a third time turn on both channels so

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.420 
a third time turn on both channels so
I'm<00:04:34.550> gonna<00:04:34.700> go<00:04:34.880> over<00:04:34.970> to<00:04:35.090> B<00:04:35.300> &amp;<00:04:35.630> B<00:04:36.260> is<00:04:36.500> a<00:04:36.530> going<00:04:37.370> to

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
I'm gonna go over to B &amp; B is a going to

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.570 
I'm gonna go over to B &amp; B is a going to
be<00:04:37.490> our<00:04:37.580> stroke<00:04:37.910> channel<00:04:38.270> in<00:04:38.330> this<00:04:38.510> okay<00:04:39.290> so

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
be our stroke channel in this okay so

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.370 
be our stroke channel in this okay so
here<00:04:40.580> we<00:04:40.670> get<00:04:40.760> an<00:04:40.880> alternating<00:04:41.480> strobing

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
here we get an alternating strobing

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.740 
here we get an alternating strobing
pattern<00:04:42.680> that's<00:04:42.830> just<00:04:43.640> by<00:04:43.790> doing<00:04:44.480> a<00:04:44.570> quick

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
pattern that's just by doing a quick

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.790 
pattern that's just by doing a quick
press<00:04:45.380> on<00:04:45.740> on<00:04:46.450> B<00:04:47.450> so<00:04:48.110> if<00:04:48.170> we<00:04:48.290> would<00:04:48.410> press<00:04:48.620> B

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
press on on B so if we would press B

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.520 
press on on B so if we would press B
again<00:04:49.100> we<00:04:49.130> would<00:04:50.090> be<00:04:50.180> getting<00:04:50.450> a<00:04:50.600> a<00:04:51.020> little<00:04:51.410> bit

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
again we would be getting a a little bit

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.210 
again we would be getting a a little bit
different<00:04:51.980> wig<00:04:52.760> wag<00:04:52.970> type<00:04:53.660> pattern<00:04:53.900> here<00:04:54.260> and

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
different wig wag type pattern here and

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.380 
different wig wag type pattern here and
then<00:04:56.210> in<00:04:56.330> this<00:04:56.450> case<00:04:56.510> we<00:04:56.960> press<00:04:57.170> B<00:04:57.290> again<00:04:57.320> and

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
then in this case we press B again and

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.450 
then in this case we press B again and
just<00:04:59.390> the<00:04:59.630> right<00:04:59.840> headlight<00:05:00.320> is<00:05:00.530> gonna<00:05:00.980> screw

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
just the right headlight is gonna screw

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.790 
just the right headlight is gonna screw
press<00:05:02.000> it<00:05:02.120> again<00:05:02.360> and<00:05:02.540> just<00:05:03.320> thought<00:05:03.500> that

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
press it again and just thought that

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.530 
press it again and just thought that
life<00:05:03.950> is<00:05:04.070> ministry<00:05:04.370> and<00:05:04.880> then<00:05:05.030> pressing<00:05:05.360> it

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.540 
life is ministry and then pressing it

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.360 
life is ministry and then pressing it
again<00:05:05.720> will<00:05:05.870> just<00:05:05.900> have<00:05:06.200> both<00:05:06.410> strobe<00:05:07.250> me

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
again will just have both strobe me

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.330 
again will just have both strobe me

breathing<00:05:26.030> this<00:05:26.390> is<00:05:26.450> just<00:05:26.840> a<00:05:26.930> function<00:05:27.140> where

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
breathing this is just a function where

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.040 
breathing this is just a function where
it's<00:05:28.550> basically<00:05:28.760> ramping<00:05:29.270> up<00:05:29.330> voltage<00:05:29.810> and

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
it's basically ramping up voltage and

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.840 
it's basically ramping up voltage and
then<00:05:30.470> bringing<00:05:30.740> down<00:05:30.919> the<00:05:31.070> voltage<00:05:31.190> so<00:05:31.640> I'm

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
then bringing down the voltage so I'm

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:33.310 
then bringing down the voltage so I'm
going<00:05:31.970> to<00:05:32.000> go<00:05:32.090> ahead<00:05:32.270> and<00:05:32.450> I'll<00:05:32.990> press<00:05:33.200> that

going to go ahead and I'll press that

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.080 
going to go ahead and I'll press that
button<00:05:33.560> again<00:05:33.800> and<00:05:34.010> now<00:05:34.370> we<00:05:34.430> have<00:05:34.610> both<00:05:34.790> sides

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
button again and now we have both sides

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.870 
button again and now we have both sides
simultaneously<00:05:36.310> doing<00:05:37.310> this<00:05:37.550> breathing

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
simultaneously doing this breathing

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:43.729 
here and guys just doing the breathing

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:46.180 
here and guys just doing the breathing
function<00:05:44.330> and<00:05:45.320> then<00:05:45.710> we'll<00:05:45.800> press<00:05:45.950> it<00:05:46.010> a<00:05:46.160> third

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
function and then we'll press it a third

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.630 
function and then we'll press it a third
time<00:05:46.550> and<00:05:46.850> what<00:05:47.360> we<00:05:47.510> have<00:05:47.660> is<00:05:48.340> the<00:05:49.340> right

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:49.640 
time and what we have is the right

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.219 
time and what we have is the right
channel<00:05:50.030> is<00:05:50.240> doing<00:05:50.479> a<00:05:50.540> breathing<00:05:50.840> function

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:51.229 
channel is doing a breathing function

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:54.010 
channel is doing a breathing function
and<00:05:51.380> the<00:05:51.890> left<00:05:52.070> channel<00:05:52.220> is<00:05:52.460> doing<00:05:52.610> a<00:05:53.020> strobing

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
and the left channel is doing a strobing

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.170 
and the left channel is doing a strobing
function<00:05:54.350> so<00:05:54.530> this<00:05:55.520> would<00:05:55.700> be<00:05:55.790> good<00:05:55.970> if<00:05:56.150> you

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
function so this would be good if you

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.450 
function so this would be good if you
have<00:05:56.360> a<00:05:56.390> dual<00:05:56.840> color<00:05:57.050> halo<00:05:57.500> kit<00:05:57.770> and<00:05:58.070> you<00:05:58.250> want

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
have a dual color halo kit and you want

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.870 
have a dual color halo kit and you want
one<00:05:58.729> color<00:05:59.300> that<00:05:59.450> slowly<00:06:00.430> get<00:06:01.430> brighter<00:06:01.700> and

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 
one color that slowly get brighter and

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.520 
one color that slowly get brighter and
dimmer<00:06:02.030> on<00:06:02.240> its<00:06:02.390> own<00:06:02.450> the<00:06:02.720> other<00:06:02.900> color<00:06:03.200> to

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530 
dimmer on its own the other color to

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.450 
dimmer on its own the other color to
screw<00:06:04.090> that<00:06:05.090> would<00:06:05.330> be<00:06:05.840> a<00:06:06.410> new<00:06:06.979> feature<00:06:07.250> to

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
screw that would be a new feature to

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:08.950 
screw that would be a new feature to
have<00:06:07.550> in<00:06:07.880> this<00:06:08.120> case<00:06:08.300> it<00:06:08.450> just<00:06:08.479> looks<00:06:08.780> kind<00:06:08.930> of

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 
have in this case it just looks kind of

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:09.850 
have in this case it just looks kind of
weird<00:06:09.080> because<00:06:09.290> you've<00:06:09.500> got<00:06:09.620> two<00:06:09.770> different

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
weird because you've got two different

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.710 
weird because you've got two different
headlights<00:06:10.340> doing<00:06:11.030> two<00:06:11.120> different<00:06:11.270> thing<00:06:11.540> the

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 
headlights doing two different thing the

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.630 
headlights doing two different thing the
D<00:06:12.320> button<00:06:12.650> is<00:06:12.830> the<00:06:12.979> last<00:06:13.130> button<00:06:13.370> here<00:06:13.550> and

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:13.640 
D button is the last button here and

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.680 
D button is the last button here and
that's<00:06:13.790> just<00:06:13.970> basically<00:06:14.210> going<00:06:14.360> to<00:06:14.419> turn

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:14.690 
that's just basically going to turn

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.380 
that's just basically going to turn
everything<00:06:15.590> off<00:06:15.890> and<00:06:16.130> then<00:06:16.729> turn<00:06:16.850> back<00:06:17.060> on<00:06:17.180> as

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.390 
everything off and then turn back on as

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:18.880 
everything off and then turn back on as
you<00:06:17.479> can<00:06:17.570> see<00:06:17.690> this<00:06:17.780> has<00:06:17.960> memory<00:06:18.350> to<00:06:18.500> it<00:06:18.530> so

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:18.890 
you can see this has memory to it so

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.310 
you can see this has memory to it so
whatever<00:06:19.669> setting<00:06:20.060> it<00:06:20.180> was<00:06:20.300> on<00:06:20.450> only<00:06:21.110> turned

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:21.320 
whatever setting it was on only turned

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.930 
whatever setting it was on only turned
it<00:06:21.410> off<00:06:21.590> is<00:06:21.860> going<00:06:22.160> to<00:06:22.220> be<00:06:22.280> the<00:06:22.370> same<00:06:22.550> setting

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:22.940 
it off is going to be the same setting

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:35.780 
it off is going to be the same setting
when<00:06:23.720> we<00:06:24.050> go<00:06:24.169> back<00:06:24.350> and<00:06:24.500> turn<00:06:24.590> it<00:06:24.680> back<00:06:24.770> on

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:35.790 

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.850
