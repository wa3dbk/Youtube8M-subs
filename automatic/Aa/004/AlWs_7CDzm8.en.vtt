marks here on some of the diamonds like

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.510 
marks here on some of the diamonds like
that<00:02:05.700> she<00:02:05.880> has<00:02:06.090> in<00:02:06.600> her<00:02:06.780> marks<00:02:07.160> and<00:02:08.160> then<00:02:08.310> for

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
that she has in her marks and then for

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.680 
that she has in her marks and then for
her<00:02:08.610> beds<00:02:08.790> right<00:02:08.940> I'm<00:02:09.090> going<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.360> use<00:02:09.479> this

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
her beds right I'm going to use this

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.390 
her beds right I'm going to use this
purple<00:02:09.960> felt<00:02:11.180> it's<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.270> dark<00:02:12.510> purple<00:02:13.370> but<00:02:14.370> I

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
purple felt it's a dark purple but I

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.550 
purple felt it's a dark purple but I
think<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:14.790> really<00:02:14.940> helps<00:02:15.300> bring<00:02:15.450> in<00:02:15.570> some<00:02:16.440> of

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
think it really helps bring in some of

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.350 
think it really helps bring in some of
the<00:02:16.620> purple<00:02:16.980> color<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.400> then<00:02:17.880> I<00:02:18.000> just<00:02:18.120> had

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
the purple color and then I just had

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.100 
the purple color and then I just had
