00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
that that does not have an automatic

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.139 
that that does not have an automatic
movement<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.340> has<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.489> manual<00:00:47.789> amount<00:00:48.090> of

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
movement that has a manual amount of

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.660 
movement that has a manual amount of
movement<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:49.620> chronograph<00:00:50.129> pushers<00:00:50.489> are

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
movement and the chronograph pushers are

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.189 
movement and the chronograph pushers are

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
on the other side other than that the

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.200 
on the other side other than that the
diet<00:00:52.410> looks<00:00:52.680> exactly<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.489> same<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:54.000> doesn't

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
diet looks exactly the same it doesn't

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.910

say<00:00:54.300> automatic<00:00:54.690> on<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.899> dial<00:00:55.079> but<00:00:55.289> it's

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
say automatic on the dial but it's

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.520 
say automatic on the dial but it's
really<00:00:56.460> easy<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.760> mix<00:00:57.360> them<00:00:57.539> up<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.020> should

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
really easy to mix them up so you should

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.170 
really easy to mix them up so you should
know<00:00:58.710> just<00:00:59.070> right<00:00:59.219> away<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.730> there's<00:00:59.940> a

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
there's a clone out there there's a

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.529 
there's a clone out there there's a
manual<00:01:01.980> around<00:01:02.430> clone<00:01:02.760> if<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.000> like<00:01:03.149> manually

are<00:03:38.199> the<00:03:38.290> right<00:03:38.440> size<00:03:38.650> I<00:03:39.129> love<00:03:39.370> it<00:03:39.519> the

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:39.639 
are the right size I love it the

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:43.920 
are the right size I love it the
chronograph<00:03:40.090> is<00:03:40.180> easy<00:03:40.419> to<00:03:40.599> read<00:03:41.250> and<00:03:42.480> so<00:03:43.480> I'm

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
chronograph is easy to read and so I'm

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.270 
chronograph is easy to read and so I'm
just<00:03:44.199> very<00:03:44.410> happy<00:03:44.739> with<00:03:44.889> this<00:03:44.949> thing<00:03:45.129> one

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
just very happy with this thing one

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.220 
just very happy with this thing one
thing<00:03:45.459> that<00:03:45.609> was<00:03:45.699> concerned<00:03:46.090> about<00:03:46.269> was<00:03:47.049> the

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
thing that was concerned about was the

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.640 
thing that was concerned about was the
fact<00:03:47.500> that<00:03:47.650> the<00:03:47.919> hands<00:03:48.609> are<00:03:48.790> white<00:03:49.180> and<00:03:49.650> that

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
fact that the hands are white and that

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.180 
fact that the hands are white and that
might<00:03:50.829> sort<00:03:51.069> of<00:03:51.160> inhibit<00:03:51.609> legibility<00:03:52.269> I<00:03:53.190> guess

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
might sort of inhibit legibility I guess

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.129 
might sort of inhibit legibility I guess
maybe<00:03:54.459> a<00:03:54.579> little<00:03:54.819> bit<00:03:55.060> over<00:03:55.269> the<00:03:55.599> chronograph

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:56.139 
maybe a little bit over the chronograph

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.099 
maybe a little bit over the chronograph
the<00:03:56.799> sub<00:03:57.040> the<00:03:57.250> sub<00:03:57.280> dials<00:03:57.760> but<00:03:57.970> in<00:03:58.299> reality<00:03:58.720> you

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
the sub the sub dials but in reality you

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.050 
the sub the sub dials but in reality you
can<00:03:59.260> see<00:03:59.470> that<00:03:59.709> the<00:03:59.799> crispness<00:04:00.250> of<00:04:00.579> everything

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
can see that the crispness of everything

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.629 
can see that the crispness of everything
makes<00:04:01.900> it<00:04:02.079> so<00:04:02.260> that<00:04:02.290> legibility<00:04:03.010> is<00:04:03.040> is<00:04:03.340> really

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:03.639 
makes it so that legibility is is really

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:05.729 
makes it so that legibility is is really
really<00:04:03.819> good<00:04:04.000> so<00:04:04.389> again<00:04:04.599> I've<00:04:04.989> been<00:04:05.019> loving<00:04:05.620> to

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
really good so again I've been loving to

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:06.960 
really good so again I've been loving to
wear<00:04:05.889> this<00:04:06.040> thing<00:04:06.280> I<00:04:06.400> think<00:04:06.609> it<00:04:06.669> looks<00:04:06.819> good

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
wear this thing I think it looks good

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.699 
wear this thing I think it looks good
it's<00:04:07.180> not<00:04:07.299> good<00:04:07.359> for<00:04:07.659> every<00:04:07.989> single<00:04:08.379> occasion

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
it's not good for every single occasion

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.289 
it's not good for every single occasion
and<00:04:09.069> every<00:04:09.250> single<00:04:09.459> thing<00:04:09.669> every<00:04:10.209> single

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
and every single thing every single

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:11.939 
and every single thing every single
thing<00:04:10.569> you<00:04:10.599> wear<00:04:10.840> but<00:04:11.470> it's<00:04:11.620> not<00:04:11.739> the<00:04:11.859> only

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:11.949 
thing you wear but it's not the only

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:14.009 
thing you wear but it's not the only
watch<00:04:12.159> that<00:04:12.459> they<00:04:12.579> make<00:04:12.760> so<00:04:13.269> let's<00:04:13.840> take<00:04:13.959> a

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
watch that they make so let's take a

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:15.240 
watch that they make so let's take a
closer<00:04:14.229> look<00:04:14.349> at<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:14.650> dial<00:04:14.889> here<00:04:15.099> because

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
closer look at the dial here because

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.560 
closer look at the dial here because
there's<00:04:15.370> some<00:04:15.489> nice<00:04:15.639> really<00:04:16.120> nice<00:04:16.299> little

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
there's some nice really nice little

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.229 
there's some nice really nice little
elements<00:04:16.959> that<00:04:17.079> I<00:04:17.139> think<00:04:17.380> you<00:04:17.799> should<00:04:17.979> know<00:04:18.239> it

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
elements that I think you should know it

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.719 
elements that I think you should know it
is<00:04:19.329> kind<00:04:19.840> of<00:04:19.930> a<00:04:20.049> little<00:04:20.229> bit<00:04:20.380> retro<00:04:21.010> style<00:04:21.370> but

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
is kind of a little bit retro style but

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.070 
is kind of a little bit retro style but
there's<00:04:21.849> a<00:04:21.940> lot<00:04:22.030> of<00:04:22.150> modern<00:04:22.479> elements<00:04:22.840> so<00:04:22.900> for

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
there's a lot of modern elements so for

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.440 
there's a lot of modern elements so for
example<00:04:23.550> let's<00:04:24.550> look<00:04:24.580> at<00:04:24.700> the<00:04:24.789> our<00:04:24.909> indicators

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
example let's look at the our indicators

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.910 
example let's look at the our indicators
they're<00:04:25.690> applied

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
they're applied

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.750 
they're applied
they've<00:04:27.920> got<00:04:28.070> loom<00:04:28.280> on<00:04:28.400> them<00:04:28.520> and<00:04:28.670> they're

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
they've got loom on them and they're

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.400 
they've got loom on them and they're
actually<00:04:28.910> pretty<00:04:29.240> well<00:04:29.480> polished<00:04:29.960> so<00:04:30.200> it's<00:04:30.320> a

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
actually pretty well polished so it's a

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.320 
actually pretty well polished so it's a
little<00:04:30.650> bit<00:04:30.770> of<00:04:30.860> a<00:04:30.980> little<00:04:31.910> bit<00:04:32.030> of<00:04:32.120> bling

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
little bit of a little bit of bling

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.820 
little bit of a little bit of bling
factor<00:04:32.630> there<00:04:33.050> you<00:04:33.170> can<00:04:33.320> see<00:04:33.530> that<00:04:33.680> there<00:04:33.800> are

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
factor there you can see that there are

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.490 
factor there you can see that there are
those<00:04:34.130> a<00:04:34.400> little<00:04:35.000> bit<00:04:35.120> of<00:04:35.210> shine<00:04:35.389> the<00:04:35.780> bezel<00:04:36.320> is

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
those a little bit of shine the bezel is

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.080 
those a little bit of shine the bezel is
polished<00:04:37.040> while<00:04:37.220> the<00:04:37.340> case<00:04:37.550> itself<00:04:37.910> is

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
polished while the case itself is

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.409 
polished while the case itself is
brushed<00:04:38.710> and<00:04:39.710> just<00:04:40.400> the<00:04:40.550> quality<00:04:40.790> is<00:04:41.090> nice<00:04:41.270> so

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
brushed and just the quality is nice so

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:43.120 
brushed and just the quality is nice so
for<00:04:41.570> example<00:04:41.900> you<00:04:42.169> look<00:04:42.320> there<00:04:42.530> around<00:04:42.830> the

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
for example you look there around the

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.010 
for example you look there around the
the<00:04:43.460> corner<00:04:43.700> Graff<00:04:43.850> sub<00:04:44.090> dials<00:04:44.450> there<00:04:44.870> is

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
the corner Graff sub dials there is

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.690 
the corner Graff sub dials there is
actually<00:04:45.590> a<00:04:45.620> polished<00:04:46.040> ring<00:04:46.280> around<00:04:46.400> there

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
actually a polished ring around there

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.610 
actually a polished ring around there
it's<00:04:46.910> hard<00:04:47.120> to<00:04:47.210> see<00:04:47.389> it<00:04:47.510> but<00:04:48.050> there<00:04:48.169> is<00:04:48.290> a<00:04:48.320> small

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
it's hard to see it but there is a small

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.250 
it's hard to see it but there is a small
polished<00:04:49.190> ring<00:04:49.460> around<00:04:49.730> the<00:04:50.330> slightly

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
polished ring around the slightly

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.950 
polished ring around the slightly

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
recessed a chronograph SI bells it's

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.750 
recessed a chronograph SI bells it's

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.190 
with our custom rotor so what does this
movement<00:05:11.720> it's<00:05:11.840> their<00:05:12.310> caliber<00:05:13.310> is<00:05:13.970> two<00:05:14.660> zero

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
movement it's their caliber is two zero

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.480 
movement it's their caliber is two zero
three<00:05:15.290> zero<00:05:15.590> what<00:05:16.040> is<00:05:16.070> that

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
three zero what is that

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.170 
three zero what is that
basically<00:05:17.210> it's<00:05:17.600> a<00:05:17.810> chronograph<00:05:18.650> module<00:05:19.520> on

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
basically it's a chronograph module on

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.210 
basically it's a chronograph module on
top<00:05:20.840> of<00:05:21.320> a<00:05:21.410> base<00:05:22.090> Solita<00:05:23.090> which<00:05:23.840> is<00:05:24.229> like<00:05:24.650> a

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
top of a base Solita which is like a

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.379 
top of a base Solita which is like a
clone<00:05:25.880> of<00:05:25.910> Etta

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:26.389 
clone of Etta

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:30.100 
clone of Etta
so<00:05:26.889> basically<00:05:27.889> got<00:05:28.040> a<00:05:28.120> base<00:05:29.120> with<00:05:29.840> a

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
so basically got a base with a

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.330 
so basically got a base with a
chronograph<00:05:31.540> module<00:05:32.540> on<00:05:32.690> top<00:05:32.900> of<00:05:33.110> it<00:05:33.290> I<00:05:33.530> think

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
chronograph module on top of it I think

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.280 
chronograph module on top of it I think
that's<00:05:34.490> fine<00:05:34.700> I<00:05:34.970> like<00:05:35.479> that<00:05:35.720> I<00:05:35.900> think<00:05:36.140> that's

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.290 
that's fine I like that I think that's

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.810 
that's fine I like that I think that's
great

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
great

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.680 
great
everything<00:05:37.820> everything<00:05:38.270> works<00:05:38.450> well

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
everything everything works well

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.150 
everything everything works well
everything's<00:05:39.050> you<00:05:39.290> know<00:05:39.320> quite<00:05:39.650> quite<00:05:40.010> nice

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
about it you know sapphire crystal I

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.219 
about it you know sapphire crystal I
would<00:05:44.000> have<00:05:44.090> liked<00:05:44.240> the<00:05:44.330> water<00:05:44.539> is<00:05:44.750> this<00:05:44.900> to<00:05:45.140> be

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:45.229 
would have liked the water is this to be

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:48.040 
would have liked the water is this to be
higher<00:05:45.410> it's<00:05:45.740> only<00:05:45.979> 50<00:05:46.940> meters<00:05:47.090> but<00:05:47.450> that's

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
higher it's only 50 meters but that's

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.630 
higher it's only 50 meters but that's
fine<00:05:48.350> I<00:05:48.410> mean<00:05:48.680> I'm<00:05:48.770> just<00:05:48.830> nitpicking<00:05:49.280> at<00:05:49.490> this

point and again remember there is a

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.940 
point and again remember there is a
manual<00:05:52.610> inversion<00:05:53.330> this<00:05:53.630> this<00:05:54.169> automatic

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950 
manual inversion this this automatic

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.159 
manual inversion this this automatic
version<00:05:55.340> is<00:05:55.520> rare<00:05:56.240> and<00:05:56.450> I'd<00:05:56.720> also<00:05:56.870> like<00:05:57.110> to
