will<00:01:08.189> be<00:01:08.280> going<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.760> forge<00:01:09.150> fast<00:01:09.450> expand<00:01:09.900> this

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
will be going a forge fast expand this

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.780 
will be going a forge fast expand this
game<00:01:10.290> as<00:01:10.470> opposed<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.040> one<00:01:11.250> gate<00:01:11.430> expands

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
game as opposed to the one gate expands

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.850 
game as opposed to the one gate expands
that<00:01:11.909> we've<00:01:12.090> seen<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.680> first<00:01:13.680> two<00:01:13.830> games

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
that we've seen in the first two games

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.410 
that we've seen in the first two games
that's<00:01:14.310> going<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.520> make<00:01:14.610> sense<00:01:14.820> on<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.119> map

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
that's going to make sense on this map

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.179 
that's going to make sense on this map
because<00:01:15.869> he<00:01:16.049> can<00:01:16.200> pretty<00:01:16.470> much<00:01:16.560> safely<00:01:16.979> go

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
because he can pretty much safely go

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.499 
because he can pretty much safely go
into<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.460> natural<00:01:17.850> expansion<00:01:18.119> will<00:01:18.450> be

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
into that natural expansion will be

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.899 
into that natural expansion will be
dropping<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.960> forge<00:01:19.259> somewhere<00:01:20.100> over<00:01:20.340> here<00:01:20.369> and

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
dropping a forge somewhere over here and

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.030 
dropping a forge somewhere over here and
then<00:01:21.330> just<00:01:21.509> continuing<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.170> full<00:01:22.560> wall<00:01:22.799> off

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
then just continuing that full wall off

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.260 
then just continuing that full wall off
getting<00:01:23.310> some<00:01:23.430> cannons<00:01:23.820> for<00:01:23.970> early<00:01:24.150> game

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
position over let's go pushing out

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.539 
position over let's go pushing out
across<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.619> map<00:01:28.770> got<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.950> second<00:01:29.430> one<00:01:29.490> also

Ling's in the main let's see what he can
do<00:03:14.200> gateways<00:03:15.040> not<00:03:15.070> even<00:03:15.430> finished<00:03:15.910> yet<00:03:16.200> so

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
do gateways not even finished yet so

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.270 
do gateways not even finished yet so
it's<00:03:17.320> gonna<00:03:17.410> be<00:03:17.500> a<00:03:17.560> little<00:03:17.709> while<00:03:17.860> until

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
it's gonna be a little while until

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.370 
it's gonna be a little while until
anything<00:03:18.760> is<00:03:18.880> out<00:03:19.000> to<00:03:19.180> stop<00:03:19.450> this<00:03:19.720> probes<00:03:20.080> pull

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
anything is out to stop this probes pull

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.050 
anything is out to stop this probes pull
don't<00:03:20.530> engage<00:03:20.770> but<00:03:21.100> every<00:03:21.400> second<00:03:21.850> that<00:03:21.940> he

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
don't engage but every second that he

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.850 
don't engage but every second that he
does<00:03:22.239> that<00:03:22.420> is<00:03:22.540> a<00:03:22.570> second<00:03:23.080> not<00:03:23.200> mining<00:03:23.680> and

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
does that is a second not mining and

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.830 
does that is a second not mining and
this<00:03:23.890> is<00:03:24.760> going<00:03:24.910> to<00:03:25.000> prove<00:03:25.209> to<00:03:25.330> be<00:03:25.360> quite

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
this is going to prove to be quite
