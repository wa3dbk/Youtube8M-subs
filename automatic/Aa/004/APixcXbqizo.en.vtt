00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
already smell the Sun of ammonia and

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.670 
already smell the Sun of ammonia and
feces<00:00:19.009> it's<00:00:19.970> really<00:00:20.240> not<00:00:20.330> very<00:00:20.390> pleasant<00:00:20.810> but

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
feces it's really not very pleasant but

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.470 
feces it's really not very pleasant but
the<00:00:21.770> door<00:00:21.980> somehow<00:00:22.550> became<00:00:22.880> broke<00:00:23.180> and

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
the door somehow became broke and

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.710 
the door somehow became broke and
according<00:00:23.900> to<00:00:24.230> their<00:00:24.590> bedroom<00:00:24.920> person<00:00:25.550> here

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
according to their bedroom person here

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.660 
according to their bedroom person here
and<00:00:26.720> so<00:00:27.050> our<00:00:27.230> bet<00:00:27.380> team<00:00:27.680> have<00:00:27.920> to<00:00:28.160> anesthetize

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
and so our bet team have to anesthetize

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.740 
and so our bet team have to anesthetize
this<00:00:29.330> bear<00:00:29.599> and<00:00:29.900> then<00:00:30.439> we<00:00:30.560> have<00:00:30.740> to<00:00:30.890> go<00:00:31.039> in<00:00:31.250> and

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
this bear and then we have to go in and

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.080 
this bear and then we have to go in and
actually<00:00:32.750> cut<00:00:33.199> the<00:00:33.320> doorway<00:00:33.830> to<00:00:33.890> food<00:00:34.400> so

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
actually cut the doorway to food so

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.389 
actually cut the doorway to food so
we're<00:00:35.750> not<00:00:35.870> sure<00:00:36.079> of<00:00:36.110> her<00:00:36.380> condition<00:00:36.710> we're

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
we're not sure of her condition we're

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:44.400 
we're not sure of her condition we're
not<00:00:37.610> sure<00:00:40.450> anyway<00:00:41.450> we<00:00:41.840> should<00:00:42.050> get<00:00:42.140> out<00:00:42.260> soon

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410

current sheds where the breeding Bears

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.290 
current sheds where the breeding Bears
have<00:00:57.170> been<00:00:57.199> housed<00:00:57.680> most<00:00:58.489> of<00:00:58.699> the<00:00:58.789> Bears<00:00:59.000> here

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
living in a very barren environment so

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.710 
living in a very barren environment so
the<00:01:08.479> plan<00:01:08.720> is<00:01:08.750> that<00:01:09.729> animals<00:01:10.729> Asia<00:01:10.939> will<00:01:11.479> be

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
the plan is that animals Asia will be

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.880 
the plan is that animals Asia will be
able<00:01:12.049> to<00:01:12.500> work<00:01:13.430> with<00:01:13.729> a<00:01:13.760> farm<00:01:14.090> to<00:01:14.590> develop<00:01:15.590> the

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
able to work with a farm to develop the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.490 
able to work with a farm to develop the
area-wide<00:01:16.640> enclosures<00:01:17.479> bringing<00:01:18.409> a

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
area-wide enclosures bringing a

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.440 
area-wide enclosures bringing a
stimulating<00:01:19.189> environment<00:01:19.280> both<00:01:19.880> physically

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
stimulating environment both physically

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.870 
stimulating environment both physically
and<00:01:20.479> mentally<00:01:20.630> for<00:01:21.229> the<00:01:21.350> Bears<00:01:21.590> first<00:01:22.400> time<00:01:22.700> in

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
and mentally for the Bears first time in

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.940 
and mentally for the Bears first time in
their<00:01:23.060> lives<00:01:23.330> and<00:01:23.659> give<00:01:24.590> them<00:01:24.770> the

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
their lives and give them the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.929 
their lives and give them the
opportunity<00:01:25.580> to<00:01:26.590> exhibit<00:01:27.590> a<00:01:27.950> repertoire<00:01:28.909> of

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
opportunity to exhibit a repertoire of

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.200 
opportunity to exhibit a repertoire of
electric<00:01:29.600> behaviors<00:01:30.340> in<00:01:31.340> this<00:01:31.880> environment

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
electric behaviors in this environment

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.050 
electric behaviors in this environment
which<00:01:32.630> at<00:01:33.020> the<00:01:33.110> moment<00:01:33.140> is<00:01:33.770> not<00:01:34.340> much<00:01:34.700> to<00:01:34.909> look

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
which at the moment is not much to look

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.130 
which at the moment is not much to look
at<00:01:35.240> but<00:01:35.299> will<00:01:35.600> one<00:01:35.810> day<00:01:36.020> be<00:01:36.290> a<00:01:36.530> paradise<00:01:38.140> this

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
at but will one day be a paradise this

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.410 
at but will one day be a paradise this
is<00:01:39.290> a<00:01:39.409> really<00:01:39.740> sad<00:01:40.040> enclosure<00:01:40.640> because<00:01:41.090> it's

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
is a really sad enclosure because it's

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.719 
is a really sad enclosure because it's
actually<00:01:41.930> the<00:01:42.200> outside<00:01:42.860> area<00:01:43.400> where<00:01:43.640> you

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
actually the outside area where you

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.880 
actually the outside area where you
think<00:01:44.000> they'd<00:01:44.150> have<00:01:44.180> a<00:01:44.329> better<00:01:44.630> life<00:01:44.960> but

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
think they'd have a better life but

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.499 
think they'd have a better life but
actually<00:01:46.070> these<00:01:46.399> are<00:01:46.579> the<00:01:46.670> breeding<00:01:47.240> males

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
actually these are the breeding males

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.990 
actually these are the breeding males
and<00:01:47.990> there<00:01:48.110> are<00:01:48.229> five<00:01:48.500> here<00:01:48.950> but<00:01:49.759> they<00:01:49.850> can

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
and there are five here but they can

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.960 
and there are five here but they can
only<00:01:50.090> let<00:01:50.420> one<00:01:50.450> out<00:01:50.720> at<00:01:51.320> any<00:01:51.500> one<00:01:51.740> time<00:01:51.970> because

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
only let one out at any one time because

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.520 
only let one out at any one time because
they<00:01:53.240> fight<00:01:53.540> and<00:01:53.780> they<00:01:53.840> fight<00:01:54.110> to<00:01:54.259> the<00:01:54.350> death

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.560 

seven<00:01:57.710> years<00:01:57.979> so<00:01:58.280> they're<00:01:58.430> all<00:01:58.520> mature<00:01:58.850> adults

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
seven years so they're all mature adults

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.950 
seven years so they're all mature adults
but<00:02:00.440> outside<00:02:01.070> of<00:02:01.130> being<00:02:01.549> in<00:02:02.119> the<00:02:02.390> enclosure

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
but outside of being in the enclosure

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.469 
but outside of being in the enclosure
they're<00:02:03.409> the<00:02:04.220> rest<00:02:04.430> of<00:02:04.610> their<00:02:04.760> life<00:02:04.909> is<00:02:05.210> just

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
they're the rest of their life is just

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.260 
they're the rest of their life is just
in<00:02:05.659> this<00:02:05.869> concrete<00:02:06.650> barren<00:02:07.159> Dame<00:02:07.430> and<00:02:08.209> we

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
in this concrete barren Dame and we

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.029 
in this concrete barren Dame and we
don't<00:02:08.450> know<00:02:08.509> how<00:02:08.690> often<00:02:08.869> they're<00:02:09.170> rotated

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
don't know how often they're rotated

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.090 
don't know how often they're rotated
they've<00:02:10.759> all<00:02:11.030> got<00:02:11.270> broken<00:02:11.930> badly<00:02:12.770> damaged

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
they've all got broken badly damaged

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.640 
they've all got broken badly damaged
teeth<00:02:13.430> and<00:02:13.880> presumably<00:02:14.750> in<00:02:14.959> the<00:02:14.989> fights<00:02:15.350> as

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
teeth and presumably in the fights as

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.470 
teeth and presumably in the fights as
well<00:02:15.680> a<00:02:15.860> couple<00:02:16.220> of<00:02:16.340> them<00:02:16.489> are<00:02:16.610> very<00:02:16.819> very<00:02:16.970> thin

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
well a couple of them are very very thin

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.780 
well a couple of them are very very thin
and<00:02:18.230> again<00:02:18.650> this<00:02:18.770> is<00:02:18.920> just<00:02:19.100> no<00:02:19.220> life<00:02:19.430> for<00:02:19.730> a

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
and again this is just no life for a
