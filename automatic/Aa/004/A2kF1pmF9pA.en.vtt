all right I'm going to go over some of
the<00:00:06.080> the<00:00:06.500> big<00:00:06.740> differences<00:00:07.339> and<00:00:07.580> changes<00:00:08.210> to

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:08.510 
the the big differences and changes to

the the big differences and changes to
the<00:00:08.690> the<00:00:09.260> new<00:00:09.440> duplex<00:00:09.980> I<00:00:10.400> will<00:00:10.910> say<00:00:11.150> we

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:11.300 
the the new duplex I will say we

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.780 
the the new duplex I will say we
couldn't<00:00:11.630> come<00:00:12.440> up<00:00:12.469> with<00:00:12.769> a<00:00:12.800> name<00:00:13.219> you<00:00:13.670> know

we've tried to reinvent the wheel on

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.729 
we've tried to reinvent the wheel on
frames<00:00:15.589> for<00:00:15.980> a<00:00:16.009> while<00:00:16.219> try<00:00:16.640> different<00:00:16.880> a<00:00:17.739> bunch

frames for a while try different a bunch
of<00:00:18.890> different<00:00:19.369> systems<00:00:19.849> and<00:00:20.029> styles<00:00:20.570> and<00:00:20.899> we

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
of different systems and styles and we

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.929 
of different systems and styles and we
always<00:00:21.739> come<00:00:21.890> back<00:00:22.040> to<00:00:22.099> the<00:00:22.279> duplex<00:00:22.579> it's

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
always come back to the duplex it's

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.389 
always come back to the duplex it's
tried<00:00:23.180> and<00:00:23.210> true<00:00:23.599> it<00:00:23.989> never<00:00:24.259> breaks<00:00:24.560> never<00:00:25.189> has

00:00:25.389 --> 00:00:25.399 
tried and true it never breaks never has

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:28.450 
tried and true it never breaks never has
issues<00:00:25.930> I<00:00:26.930> would<00:00:27.290> say<00:00:27.470> never<00:00:27.680> has<00:00:27.919> very<00:00:28.160> few

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.539 
supposed to do it's going to bounce
around

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
around

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.100 
around
I've<00:01:46.670> got<00:01:46.820> no<00:01:46.970> contact<00:01:47.420> with<00:01:47.630> your<00:01:47.750> shoulder

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
I've got no contact with your shoulder

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.859 
I've got no contact with your shoulder
pads<00:01:48.350> basically<00:01:48.950> you<00:01:49.430> stop<00:01:49.760> on<00:01:50.390> the<00:01:50.630> side<00:01:50.840> of

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
pads basically you stop on the side of

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.929 
pads basically you stop on the side of
the<00:01:51.049> trail<00:01:51.320> flip<00:01:52.220> that<00:01:52.430> on<00:01:52.659> drop<00:01:53.659> it<00:01:53.840> down<00:01:54.020> to<00:01:54.320> I

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939 
the trail flip that on drop it down to I

00:01:54.939 --> 00:02:00.060 
the trail flip that on drop it down to I
mean<00:01:55.939> in<00:01:56.060> my<00:01:56.210> case<00:01:56.260> 24<00:01:57.260> you<00:01:58.040> hook<00:01:58.280> that<00:01:58.310> back<00:01:58.790> up

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
mean in my case 24 you hook that back up

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.800 
mean in my case 24 you hook that back up
now<00:02:01.070> you<00:02:01.130> got<00:02:01.340> a<00:02:01.369> 24<00:02:01.909> inch<00:02:02.060> shoulder<00:02:02.390> lift<00:02:02.600> and

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
now you got a 24 inch shoulder lift and

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.749 
now you got a 24 inch shoulder lift and
you<00:02:02.869> have<00:02:02.990> a<00:02:03.020> slow<00:02:03.380> stabilizer<00:02:04.159> more<00:02:04.580> than<00:02:04.729> a

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
you have a slow stabilizer more than a

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.179 
you have a slow stabilizer more than a
lifter<00:02:05.320> before<00:02:06.320> that<00:02:06.590> would<00:02:06.740> take<00:02:06.950> five

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
lifter before that would take five

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.550 
lifter before that would take five
minutes<00:02:07.580> with<00:02:08.269> the<00:02:08.390> old<00:02:08.569> system<00:02:09.110> so<00:02:09.140> that's

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
minutes with the old system so that's

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.349 
minutes with the old system so that's
where<00:02:09.799> we<00:02:09.950> fixed<00:02:10.340> or<00:02:10.519> changed<00:02:11.209> not

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:11.359 
where we fixed or changed not

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:13.269 
where we fixed or changed not
necessarily<00:02:11.810> fix<00:02:12.079> the<00:02:12.319> load<00:02:12.560> lifter<00:02:12.950> angle

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:13.279 
necessarily fix the load lifter angle

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:15.580 
necessarily fix the load lifter angle
adjustments<00:02:14.019> so<00:02:15.019> if<00:02:15.079> you're<00:02:15.169> going<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.319> run

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
adjustments so if you're going to run

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.110 
adjustments so if you're going to run
run<00:02:15.800> you're<00:02:15.980> going<00:02:16.099> to<00:02:16.160> do<00:02:16.280> whatever<00:02:16.459> shorter

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
run you're going to do whatever shorter

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.970 
run you're going to do whatever shorter
taller<00:02:17.390> you<00:02:17.989> can<00:02:18.020> adjust<00:02:18.470> that<00:02:18.680> quickly

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
taller you can adjust that quickly

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.160 
taller you can adjust that quickly
there's<00:02:19.880> we<00:02:20.030> also<00:02:20.209> did<00:02:20.599> this<00:02:20.780> which<00:02:20.989> I'll

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
there's we also did this which I'll

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.440 
there's we also did this which I'll
explain<00:02:21.590> on<00:02:21.650> a<00:02:21.800> different<00:02:22.250> frame<00:02:22.520> is<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:23.300> be

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
explain on a different frame is to be

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.449 
explain on a different frame is to be
able<00:02:23.510> everybody<00:02:24.170> wants<00:02:24.440> a<00:02:24.500> load<00:02:24.709> shelf<00:02:25.099> every

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
I mean if I had a dollar for every one

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.050 
I mean if I had a dollar for every one
that<00:02:27.260> calls<00:02:27.500> me<00:02:27.770> that<00:02:27.980> wants<00:02:28.190> load<00:02:28.430> shelf<00:02:28.849> and

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
found anyone that prefers using one but

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.900 
found anyone that prefers using one but
you<00:03:33.500> never<00:03:33.650> know<00:03:33.920> this<00:03:34.100> everybody's<00:03:34.670> built

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
you never know this everybody's built

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.240 
you never know this everybody's built
differently<00:03:35.450> so<00:03:35.989> that's<00:03:36.170> why<00:03:36.410> we<00:03:36.620> change<00:03:36.950> this

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
differently so that's why we change this

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.729 
differently so that's why we change this
whole<00:03:37.489> system<00:03:37.900> comfort<00:03:38.900> because<00:03:39.109> of<00:03:39.410> the<00:03:39.500> foam

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
whole system comfort because of the foam

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.970 
whole system comfort because of the foam
here<00:03:40.630> adjustability<00:03:41.630> quicker<00:03:42.590> and<00:03:42.799> easier

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
here adjustability quicker and easier

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.490 
here adjustability quicker and easier
also<00:03:43.489> the<00:03:44.000> same<00:03:44.239> shoulder<00:03:44.540> strap<00:03:45.019> will<00:03:45.230> adjust

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
also the same shoulder strap will adjust

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.800 
also the same shoulder strap will adjust
to<00:03:45.739> somebody<00:03:46.069> with<00:03:46.250> a<00:03:46.280> 15<00:03:46.790> inch<00:03:46.970> torso<00:03:47.269> up<00:03:47.660> to

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
quickly

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.949 
quickly
alright<00:03:52.579> so<00:03:52.760> that's<00:03:53.150> why<00:03:53.329> we<00:03:53.480> change<00:03:53.750> those

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
alright so that's why we change those

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.979 
alright so that's why we change those
things<00:03:54.230> now<00:03:54.560> the<00:03:54.620> lumbar<00:03:55.160> pad<00:03:55.600> we<00:03:56.600> covered

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
things now the lumbar pad we covered

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.039 
things now the lumbar pad we covered
this<00:03:57.170> entire<00:03:57.380> lumbar<00:03:58.190> pad<00:03:58.489> with<00:03:59.359> it's<00:03:59.660> not<00:03:59.870> the

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
this entire lumbar pad with it's not the

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:01.509 
this entire lumbar pad with it's not the
pigskin<00:04:00.410> that<00:04:00.680> we<00:04:00.799> normally<00:04:01.130> use<00:04:01.160> it's<00:04:01.430> a

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
pigskin that we normally use it's a

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.580 
pigskin that we normally use it's a
little<00:04:01.790> bit<00:04:01.940> different<00:04:02.150> material<00:04:02.840> but<00:04:03.440> we

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
little bit different material but we

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.920 
little bit different material but we
also<00:04:03.829> change<00:04:04.340> the<00:04:04.639> form<00:04:05.000> of<00:04:05.269> the<00:04:05.420> lumbar<00:04:05.690> pad

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
also change the form of the lumbar pad

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.770 
also change the form of the lumbar pad
the<00:04:06.079> sheer<00:04:06.319> size<00:04:06.760> that<00:04:07.760> is<00:04:08.030> because<00:04:08.480> it<00:04:08.690> will

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
the sheer size that is because it will

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.780 
the sheer size that is because it will
help<00:04:08.959> displace<00:04:09.530> the<00:04:09.829> weight<00:04:10.010> even<00:04:10.549> better

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
help displace the weight even better

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.690 
help displace the weight even better
across<00:04:11.299> that<00:04:11.540> entire<00:04:11.600> pad<00:04:12.319> which<00:04:13.160> helps<00:04:13.489> keep

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
across that entire pad which helps keep

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.670 
across that entire pad which helps keep
you<00:04:14.180> know<00:04:14.299> obviously<00:04:14.660> the<00:04:14.780> pack<00:04:14.989> suspended<00:04:15.590> or

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
up on your hip bone so we change the

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.879 
up on your hip bone so we change the
foam<00:04:18.039> in<00:04:19.039> the<00:04:19.250> size<00:04:19.489> we<00:04:19.970> also<00:04:20.120> made<00:04:20.600> this

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
foam in the size we also made this

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.320

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
on a different video on the shorter

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.450 
on a different video on the shorter

frame cuz I don't want anybody getting

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.290 
frame cuz I don't want anybody getting
an<00:05:11.640> idea<00:05:11.910> around<00:05:12.060> the<00:05:12.240> 26<00:05:12.810> inch<00:05:13.020> frame<00:05:14.300> without

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
an idea around the 26 inch frame without

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.970 
an idea around the 26 inch frame without
a<00:05:15.480> belt<00:05:15.750> it's<00:05:16.050> just<00:05:16.260> not<00:05:16.380> a<00:05:16.410> good<00:05:16.590> idea<00:05:16.710> so

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
a belt it's just not a good idea so

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.410 
a belt it's just not a good idea so
either<00:05:17.430> way<00:05:17.670> those<00:05:17.880> are<00:05:17.910> some<00:05:18.150> of<00:05:18.240> the<00:05:18.300> reasons

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:18.420 
either way those are some of the reasons

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.000 
either way those are some of the reasons
why<00:05:18.690> we<00:05:18.900> did<00:05:19.110> what<00:05:19.290> we<00:05:19.410> did<00:05:19.560> there's<00:05:19.770> a<00:05:19.830> little

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
why we did what we did there's a little

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.130 
why we did what we did there's a little
more<00:05:20.160> to<00:05:20.220> it<00:05:20.610> but<00:05:20.850> that<00:05:21.390> should<00:05:21.630> explain<00:05:21.780> a<00:05:21.960> lot

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
more to it but that should explain a lot

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.440 
more to it but that should explain a lot
of<00:05:22.230> stuff
