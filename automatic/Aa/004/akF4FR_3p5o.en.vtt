00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.540 
stomach just do this regenerate yourself
I<00:04:21.530> suggest<00:04:22.160> using<00:04:22.370> one<00:04:22.670> hand<00:04:22.700> and<00:04:24.550> basically

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
I suggest using one hand and basically

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.910 
I suggest using one hand and basically
you're<00:04:25.670> going<00:04:25.910> to<00:04:25.970> have<00:04:26.090> unlimited

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
you're going to have unlimited

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:33.070 
you're going to have unlimited
restoration<00:04:28.720> powers<00:04:29.720> and<00:04:30.310> you<00:04:31.310> can<00:04:31.930> you<00:04:32.930> can

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
restoration powers and you can you can

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.740 
restoration powers and you can you can
pretty<00:04:33.290> much<00:04:33.350> do<00:04:33.710> this<00:04:33.920> until<00:04:34.370> you<00:04:34.750> freaking

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
pretty much do this until you freaking

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.370 
pretty much do this until you freaking
level<00:04:36.290> up<00:04:36.470> and<00:04:36.650> so<00:04:37.480> we<00:04:38.480> got<00:04:38.630> restoration

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
level up and so we got restoration

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.150 
level up and so we got restoration
that's<00:04:39.590> 26<00:04:40.190> and<00:04:40.520> about<00:04:41.300> halfway<00:04:41.720> there<00:04:42.230> all

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
that's 26 and about halfway there all

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:55.140 
that's 26 and about halfway there all
right<00:04:43.310> so<00:04:43.760> give<00:04:44.630> it<00:04:44.660> another<00:04:44.960> minute

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.560 

and<00:04:55.510> after<00:04:56.170> a<00:04:56.200> while<00:04:56.470> I<00:04:56.860> level<00:04:57.520> up<00:04:57.670> this<00:04:58.210> isn't

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
and after a while I level up this isn't

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.160 
and after a while I level up this isn't
the<00:04:58.690> fastest<00:04:59.230> way<00:04:59.290> but<00:05:00.390> what<00:05:01.390> the<00:05:01.600> heck<00:05:01.720> I<00:05:01.990> I
