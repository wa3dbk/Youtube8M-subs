for<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.640> notes<00:00:44.940> in<00:00:45.150> it<00:00:45.989> turned<00:00:46.199> out<00:00:46.350> that

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 
for the notes in it turned out that

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:55.810 
for the notes in it turned out that
these<00:00:46.620> were<00:00:46.680> them<00:00:49.129> so<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.160> was<00:00:50.580> like<00:00:50.820> record

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.950 

it's<00:00:56.820> really<00:00:57.030> laggy<00:00:57.269> right<00:00:57.510> now<00:00:57.629> because<00:00:57.839> I

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
it's really laggy right now because I

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.590 
it's really laggy right now because I
have<00:00:58.170> my<00:00:58.680> screen<00:00:59.010> on<00:00:59.129> record<00:00:59.520> but<00:00:59.760> you<00:01:00.300> get<00:01:00.450> the

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
have my screen on record but you get the

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.249 
have my screen on record but you get the
idea<00:01:01.309> so<00:01:02.309> then<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.550> went<00:01:02.879> here<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.719> said<00:01:03.989> one

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
idea so then I went here and I said one

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:06.230 
idea so then I went here and I said one
forced<00:01:04.649> note<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.369> dragged<00:01:05.700> every<00:01:05.970> single

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
forced note so it dragged every single

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.310 
forced note so it dragged every single
note<00:01:06.390> down<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.440> the<00:01:07.649> one<00:01:07.800> fourth<00:01:08.509> beat<00:01:09.509> so<00:01:10.050> it's

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
note down to the one fourth beat so it's

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:19.460 
note down to the one fourth beat so it's
more<00:01:10.530> accurate<00:01:16.070> and<00:01:17.070> then<00:01:18.110> it's<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.229> lot<00:01:19.320> of

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
more accurate and then it's a lot of

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.109 
more accurate and then it's a lot of
editing<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.039> select<00:01:20.460> what<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.670> do<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:21.090> I

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
editing and this select what I do is I

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.930 
editing and this select what I do is I
copy<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.740> then<00:01:22.800> paste<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.490> again<00:01:23.580> and

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
copy this and then paste it again and

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.540 
copy this and then paste it again and
then<00:01:24.030> drag<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.630> oh<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.860> didn't<00:01:26.070> work<00:01:26.100> let<00:01:26.520> me

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
then drag it oh that didn't work let me

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.200 
then drag it oh that didn't work let me
try<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:26.789> again<00:01:27.800> then<00:01:28.800> I<00:01:28.860> paste<00:01:29.160> it<00:01:29.429> all<00:01:29.550> and<00:01:29.910> I

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
try that again then I paste it all and I

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.170 
try that again then I paste it all and I
take<00:01:30.600> one<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.530> slide<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:32.009> up<00:01:32.159> one<00:01:32.460> octave<00:01:32.729> or

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
take one and slide it up one octave or

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.710 
take one and slide it up one octave or
down<00:01:33.420> one<00:01:33.659> octave

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.590 

and<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:42.700> basically<00:01:42.880> I<00:01:43.090> did<00:01:43.270> that<00:01:43.420> for<00:01:43.540> the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
and so basically I did that for the

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.870 
and so basically I did that for the
whole<00:01:43.750> song<00:01:43.990> then<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:48.280> if<00:01:48.430> I<00:01:48.520> make<00:01:48.670> a<00:01:48.700> mistake

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
whole song then and if I make a mistake

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.210 
whole song then and if I make a mistake
it's<00:01:49.240> okay<00:01:49.330> because<00:01:49.690> like<00:01:49.990> I<00:01:50.170> can<00:01:50.650> just<00:01:50.830> fix

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
it's okay because like I can just fix

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.960 
it's okay because like I can just fix
the<00:01:51.370> note<00:01:51.580> like<00:01:51.700> let's<00:01:51.910> say<00:01:52.350> these<00:01:53.350> are<00:01:53.590> wrong

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
the note like let's say these are wrong

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.050 
the note like let's say these are wrong
so<00:01:54.970> well<00:01:55.690> if<00:01:55.810> there's<00:01:55.990> double<00:01:56.290> notes<00:01:56.470> here

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
so well if there's double notes here

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.110 
so well if there's double notes here
that's<00:01:58.060> not<00:01:58.210> cool

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120 
that's not cool

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.820 
that's not cool
so<00:02:01.120> let's<00:02:01.630> say<00:02:01.810> I<00:02:01.840> made<00:02:02.050> that<00:02:02.200> mistake

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
so let's say I made that mistake

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.859 
so let's say I made that mistake
it's<00:02:03.220> a<00:02:03.310> G<00:02:03.490> sharp<00:02:03.520> instead<00:02:04.210> of<00:02:04.330> the<00:02:06.780> C<00:02:07.780> it

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
it's a G sharp instead of the C it

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.080 
it's a G sharp instead of the C it
sounds<00:02:08.110> bad<00:02:08.259> so<00:02:08.649> then<00:02:08.800> I<00:02:08.920> just<00:02:09.100> move<00:02:09.220> it<00:02:09.429> up<00:02:12.090> so

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
sounds bad so then I just move it up so

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.400 
sounds bad so then I just move it up so
basically<00:02:13.420> I<00:02:13.510> did<00:02:13.720> that<00:02:13.870> for<00:02:13.989> the<00:02:14.050> whole<00:02:14.200> song

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
basically I did that for the whole song

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.190 
basically I did that for the whole song
and<00:02:14.739> I<00:02:15.520> added<00:02:15.760> a<00:02:15.820> lot<00:02:15.970> of<00:02:16.060> effects<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:16.900> make<00:02:17.020> it

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
and I added a lot of effects to make it

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.420 
and I added a lot of effects to make it
sound<00:02:17.320> better<00:02:17.820> so<00:02:18.820> let's<00:02:19.750> take<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.800> drums<00:02:21.220> for

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
sound better so let's take the drums for

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:32.130 
sound better so let's take the drums for
example<00:02:30.510> normally<00:02:31.510> they<00:02:31.840> don't<00:02:31.959> sound

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
example normally they don't sound

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.810 
example normally they don't sound
anything<00:02:32.440> like<00:02:32.590> that<00:02:34.620> but<00:02:35.620> if<00:02:35.950> you<00:02:36.400> edit<00:02:36.700> the

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
anything like that but if you edit the

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.789 
anything like that but if you edit the
effect<00:02:37.290> off<00:02:38.290> of<00:02:38.590> basing<00:02:39.160> him<00:02:40.680> sounds<00:02:41.680> like

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
effect off of basing him sounds like

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.470 
effect off of basing him sounds like
that<00:02:42.040> but<00:02:42.340> that<00:02:42.730> doesn't<00:02:42.910> go<00:02:43.060> with<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.269> song

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
that but that doesn't go with the song

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.990 
that but that doesn't go with the song
so<00:02:43.720> I<00:02:43.780> added<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:44.110> fat<00:02:44.320> bass<00:02:44.530> yeah<00:02:44.769> fat<00:02:45.580> person

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
so I added a fat bass yeah fat person

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.030 
so I added a fat bass yeah fat person
and<00:02:46.540> then<00:02:47.110> it<00:02:47.200> ended<00:02:47.440> up<00:02:47.560> sounding<00:02:47.769> really

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
and then it ended up sounding really

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.580 
and then it ended up sounding really
good<00:02:48.280> so<00:02:48.690> well<00:02:49.690> I<00:02:49.750> don't<00:02:49.930> even<00:02:50.019> think<00:02:50.290> to<00:02:50.380> sound

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
good so well I don't even think to sound

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:51.750

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
I messed up on the bass a lot but it's

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.770 
I messed up on the bass a lot but it's
okay<00:02:55.330> still<00:02:55.570> so<00:02:56.200> here<00:02:56.830> is<00:02:57.040> like<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:58.450> strings

make<00:03:51.910> it<00:03:52.090> like<00:03:52.240> sound<00:03:52.510> a<00:03:52.660> bit<00:03:52.690> stronger<00:03:53.700> so<00:03:54.700> I

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
make it like sound a bit stronger so I

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.010 
make it like sound a bit stronger so I
don't<00:03:54.880> know<00:03:54.940> like<00:03:55.030> this<00:03:55.180> I<00:03:55.330> just<00:03:55.360> really<00:03:55.840> makes

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.460 
don't know like this I just really makes
noises<00:03:56.790> and<00:03:57.790> that's<00:03:58.240> basically<00:03:58.750> it<00:03:59.050> I<00:03:59.080> just

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
noises and that's basically it I just

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.610 
noises and that's basically it I just
had<00:03:59.830> to<00:03:59.950> listen<00:04:00.220> to<00:04:00.280> a<00:04:00.460> lot<00:04:00.930> to<00:04:01.930> the<00:04:02.080> song<00:04:02.290> a<00:04:02.320> few

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
had to listen to a lot to the song a few

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.680 
had to listen to a lot to the song a few
times<00:04:02.890> and<00:04:03.190> then<00:04:03.310> just<00:04:03.520> copy<00:04:03.850> and<00:04:04.090> paste<00:04:04.360> quite

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690
