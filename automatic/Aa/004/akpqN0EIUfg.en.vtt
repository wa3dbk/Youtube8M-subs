what<00:00:38.070> do<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.190> think<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.460> going<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.850> beat<00:00:39.030> the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
what do you think is going to beat the

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.119 
what do you think is going to beat the
key<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:39.870> matchup<00:00:40.170> well<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:40.800> think<00:00:40.920> the

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
key to this matchup well I think the

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.799 
key to this matchup well I think the
keys<00:00:41.340> not<00:00:41.579> if<00:00:41.820> we<00:00:41.940> always<00:00:42.090> say<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.420> sniper<00:00:42.629> but

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
keys not if we always say the sniper but

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.150 
keys not if we always say the sniper but
I<00:00:42.840> think<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.110> key<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.290> gonna<00:00:43.500> be<00:00:43.559> whatever

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
I think the key is gonna be whatever

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.740 
I think the key is gonna be whatever
team<00:00:44.430> can<00:00:44.670> hold<00:00:44.850> down<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.120> other<00:00:45.329> team's<00:00:45.570> base

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
team can hold down the other team's base

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:46.970 
team can hold down the other team's base
more<00:00:46.020> effectively<00:00:46.500> we're<00:00:46.649> gonna<00:00:46.739> look<00:00:46.920> for

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
more effectively we're gonna look for

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.830 
more effectively we're gonna look for
flanks<00:00:47.489> flame<00:00:47.760> swords<00:00:48.090> known<00:00:48.390> for<00:00:48.750> getting

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
flanks flame swords known for getting

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.450 
flanks flame swords known for getting
behind<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.440> other<00:00:49.559> team<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:50.129> I'm<00:00:50.190> expecting

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
behind the other team so I'm expecting

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.040 
behind the other team so I'm expecting
to<00:00:50.670> see<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:51.030> here<00:00:51.239> in<00:00:51.329> this<00:00:51.449> game<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.989> looks

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
to see that here in this game it looks

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.569

like it's gone for the early man cannon
there<00:00:53.699> 8<00:00:53.820> we<00:00:54.000> don't<00:00:54.239> immediately<00:00:54.840> going<00:00:55.020> for
