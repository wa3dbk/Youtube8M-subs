found out there as well so you really

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.260 
found out there as well so you really
need<00:00:01.800> to<00:00:01.949> pick<00:00:02.129> up<00:00:02.159> his<00:00:02.399> own<00:00:02.580> economics<00:00:03.179> he

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
need to pick up his own economics he

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.640 
need to pick up his own economics he
can't<00:00:03.540> stay<00:00:03.750> on<00:00:03.840> these<00:00:03.929> two<00:00:04.110> bases<00:00:04.410> for<00:00:04.440> much

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
can't stay on these two bases for much

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:05.960 
can't stay on these two bases for much
longer<00:00:04.770> because<00:00:04.920> does<00:00:05.279> that<00:00:05.400> much<00:00:05.549> mining<00:00:05.759> is

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
longer because does that much mining is

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.990 
longer because does that much mining is
putting<00:00:06.270> a<00:00:06.330> commander<00:00:06.690> right<00:00:06.839> now<00:00:06.870> though<00:00:08.000> yep

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
putting a commander right now though yep

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.370 
putting a commander right now though yep
it's<00:00:09.150> finally<00:00:09.480> preparing<00:00:09.900> for<00:00:10.050> his<00:00:10.139> third

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
it's finally preparing for his third

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.440 
it's finally preparing for his third
base<00:00:10.650> might<00:00:10.889> be<00:00:11.010> a<00:00:11.040> little<00:00:11.400> bit<00:00:11.670> later<00:00:11.940> think

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
base might be a little bit later think

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.549 
base might be a little bit later think
he<00:00:12.540> probably<00:00:12.660> should<00:00:12.960> have<00:00:13.019> started<00:00:13.139> building

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
he probably should have started building

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:14.660 
he probably should have started building
that<00:00:13.679> as<00:00:13.799> soon<00:00:13.950> as<00:00:14.009> he<00:00:14.070> took<00:00:14.250> out<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.519> two

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
that as soon as he took out the two

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.150 
that as soon as he took out the two
o'clock<00:00:15.000> cuz<00:00:15.660> he<00:00:15.870> got<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.049> lot<00:00:16.440> of<00:00:16.470> damage<00:00:16.859> done

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
o'clock cuz he got a lot of damage done

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.950 
o'clock cuz he got a lot of damage done
flashing<00:00:17.699> played<00:00:17.880> very<00:00:18.150> smart<00:00:18.539> in<00:00:18.630> this<00:00:18.750> game

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
flashing played very smart in this game

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.779 
flashing played very smart in this game
of<00:00:19.230> course<00:00:19.500> he's<00:00:19.650> still<00:00:19.859> dealing<00:00:20.070> with<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.430> lot

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
of course he's still dealing with a lot

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.640 
of course he's still dealing with a lot
of<00:00:20.850> ultras<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.600> think<00:00:21.930> this<00:00:22.020> game<00:00:22.260> is<00:00:22.320> actually

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
of ultras I think this game is actually

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.130 
of ultras I think this game is actually
very<00:00:22.859> very<00:00:23.160> close<00:00:23.670> now<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.330> jaedong<00:00:24.869> is<00:00:24.990> on

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
very very close now the jaedong is on

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.080 
very very close now the jaedong is on
three<00:00:25.500> bases<00:00:25.920> yet<00:00:26.310> he's<00:00:26.580> not<00:00:26.789> going<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.029> be

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
three bases yet he's not going to be

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.080 
three bases yet he's not going to be
able<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.359> support<00:00:27.539> ultra<00:00:28.080> lyst<00:00:28.820> tech<00:00:29.820> forever

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
able to support ultra lyst tech forever

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.150 
able to support ultra lyst tech forever
and<00:00:30.570> flash<00:00:30.869> can<00:00:31.140> keep<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.500> basis<00:00:31.800> going<00:00:32.040> down

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
and flash can keep the basis going down

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.440 
and flash can keep the basis going down
if<00:00:32.279> he<00:00:32.309> can<00:00:32.460> take<00:00:32.610> down<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:32.820> new<00:00:33.090> base<00:00:33.270> down

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
if he can take down that new base down

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.930 
if he can take down that new base down
at<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.630> five<00:00:33.750> o'clock<00:00:33.930> position<00:00:34.670> under<00:00:35.670> seven

Canal he's coming down as fast as he can
with<00:00:53.579> those<00:00:53.820> science<00:00:54.120> vessels<00:00:54.449> first<00:00:54.719> so<00:00:55.320> he

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
with those science vessels first so he

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.560 
with those science vessels first so he
can<00:00:55.559> see<00:00:55.860> what<00:00:56.190> he's<00:00:56.370> up<00:00:56.520> against<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.210> jalen

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
can see what he's up against and jalen

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.270 
can see what he's up against and jalen
knows<00:00:57.719> about<00:00:57.989> this<00:00:58.170> coming<00:00:58.410> in<00:00:58.559> with<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.710> huge

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
knows about this coming in with a huge

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.959 
knows about this coming in with a huge
force<00:00:59.850> of<00:01:00.120> ultras<00:01:00.960> all<00:01:01.170> being<00:01:01.500> irradiated<00:01:01.969> so

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
force of ultras all being irradiated so

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.609 
force of ultras all being irradiated so
the<00:01:03.090> more<00:01:03.300> ultras<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.809> are<00:01:03.930> irradiated<00:01:04.199> here

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
the more ultras that are irradiated here

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.109 
the more ultras that are irradiated here
the<00:01:04.799> easier<00:01:05.070> it's<00:01:05.159> going<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.369> be<00:01:05.460> for<00:01:05.729> flash<00:01:05.939> to

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
the easier it's going to be for flash to

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.880 
the easier it's going to be for flash to
break<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.390> with<00:01:06.479> his<00:01:06.630> huge<00:01:06.960> medica<00:01:07.619> marine

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
break it with his huge medica marine

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.640 
break it with his huge medica marine
army<00:01:08.479> wow<00:01:09.479> it's<00:01:09.840> going<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.080> be<00:01:10.170> insane<00:01:10.290> one

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
army wow it's going to be insane one

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.289 
army wow it's going to be insane one
science<00:01:10.950> vessel<00:01:11.220> goes<00:01:11.340> down<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.640> think<00:01:11.939> that

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
science vessel goes down I think that

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.700 
science vessel goes down I think that
flash<00:01:12.540> will<00:01:12.840> try<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.049> break<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:13.380> eventually

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
flash will try to break this eventually

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.980 
flash will try to break this eventually
he's<00:01:14.070> going<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.280> be<00:01:14.369> waiting<00:01:14.850> for<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.540> ultras

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
he's going to be waiting for the ultras

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.109 
he's going to be waiting for the ultras
to<00:01:16.020> get<00:01:16.290> weakened<00:01:16.799> by<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.310> irradiated<00:01:17.939> and

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
to get weakened by the irradiated and

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.210 
to get weakened by the irradiated and
not<00:01:18.270> only<00:01:18.540> does<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.750> does<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.680> radiate<00:01:20.070> week

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
not only does it does the radiate week

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.740 
not only does it does the radiate week
in<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.400> ultras<00:01:20.729> weakens<00:01:21.119> all<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.479> troops

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.060 
basically I think there's a power outage
and<00:05:29.230> basically<00:05:30.230> you<00:05:30.410> think<00:05:30.710> in<00:05:30.800> a<00:05:30.890> situation

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
and basically you think in a situation

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.060 
and basically you think in a situation
like<00:05:31.370> this<00:05:31.640> there'd<00:05:31.970> be<00:05:32.120> a<00:05:32.150> regain<00:05:32.600> right<00:05:33.070> yeah

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
like this there'd be a regain right yeah

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.890 
like this there'd be a regain right yeah
there<00:05:34.970> would<00:05:35.060> be<00:05:35.120> a<00:05:35.270> regain<00:05:35.630> they're<00:05:35.780> not

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
there would be a regain they're not

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.300 
there would be a regain they're not
going<00:05:36.020> to<00:05:36.080> regain<00:05:36.440> they're<00:05:36.800> not<00:05:37.040> they're

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310
