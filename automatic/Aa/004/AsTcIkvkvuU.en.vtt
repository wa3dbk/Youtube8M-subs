00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.970
 There are several things to consider about cilantro 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:11.999
 On the one hand, the choir often comes with root 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:16.710
 that is to say, if the root percent is still very dirty Gander cutting edge 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.570
 Maybe it's his first time off since I only do the Better Process Day 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.570
 With the dirty roots we usually want to work too many percent 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.130
 Contaminants and sand and scree with none on the work surface either 

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:33.110
 I need to leaf through the whole normal travel just plucked 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.870
 because the leaves are very sensitive 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.830
 give beautiful shape and praise 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.660
 and plan for versatile use 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.550
 Constructs the Koreans but as a spice ingredient or are simply around in the 2 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.770
 Small cut shape 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.470
 I can twitch a ready-made GAAP like hamlet parsley and later 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.070
 then had through 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.770
 at Coriander is still very young or relatively young is there are the one 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.050
 Leaf styles are also very fine and softened as you can dialogue 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.420
 good conscience use and therefore Staig the now one with 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.860
 40 investigators have 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.590
 Cut the 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.210
 Farmer Blatter in smeared Ethnic 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.080
 in that breadth you would like to have as rough as I want you to have 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.830
 and here as long as it is still soft cut that easy 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.700
 Use stems with 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.460
 towards the end when the players are rooted a bit tighter in the direction 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.860
 I have to think about it if I can 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.860
 breaks that wants to have or if I just because 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.899
 4 again a bit of satire and how individual sheets Mr. extract 4 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.060
 otherwise as I said later, the percent again for other purposes 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.540
 use 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.160
 only Koreans come just the village to the FEI I did not want to go 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.490
 Do you know the freedom Skat? 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.490
 had a bit more 

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:10.749
 that is just how far 

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:13.529
 completely 

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:16.529
 finely chopped cilantro 

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:35.749
 That's the way it is 

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:37.319
 roughly hacked 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:38.789
 for use in 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:41.589
 Soups mainly in the Arctic kitchen
