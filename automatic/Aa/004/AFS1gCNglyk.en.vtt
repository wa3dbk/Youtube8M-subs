00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 more than a basketball player our guest 2011 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.529
 of tonight is an artist an acrobat 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.030
 arnaud do it we receive kadour ziani 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.550
 originating from saint dizier he makes 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.139
 dunk and well a specialty or how 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.199
 mark baskets so so 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.630
 spectacular 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:20.100
 hello kadour ziani hello dizy animal 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.350
 in fact part of these champardennais is going 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.060
 say more known I think abroad 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.460
 maybe in France than in the 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.439
 region thanks to the internet no doubt your 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.699
 discipline is basketball on August 2nd and 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.920
 what is the dock what for 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.300
 give a definition we can give a 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.320
 definition it's a discipline to 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.300
 inside a discipline 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.190
 we will say that crazy is the way 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.579
 of violently tackling the ball in the 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.520
 circle 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.780
 and so here we went we took it out 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.129
 a little basketball there we made it a 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.420
 discipline in its own right for example 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.100
 find this stuff in the sauce 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.840
 spectacular actions between the 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.280
 show and basketball where there we see here 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.930
 there is between the show and basketball 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.430
 because we still do so so 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.480
 my goal of the game is to make the link 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.969
 between us and the public 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.680
 so we do a little bit of it we see james 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.539
 white jump in the air but also like 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.600
 you saw I had in the picture just 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.460
 before it's a way to use 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.439
 every means to lift the 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.150
 crowds and involve them 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.979
 here we see vince carter take off 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.630
 in the air it 's gone but 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:18.119
 it's only the ccl gesture that all 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.700
 the young ones advocates for 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.670
 try to also identify with everything 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:29.909
 to all these stars so here we see the 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:32.549
 rhythm to face casting and the record of 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.549
 world of the highest kick foot so I 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.740
 touch the basket with the foot 3 05 and 3 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.119
 May 0.5g pauline a center untimely 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.470
 on the overfill it's a way of 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.240
 to say that it is a small step for 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.280
 the man but a big kick in 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.570
 the buttocks of humanity through both 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.979
 who thanks to this discipline we will say 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.119
 that the internet has progressed because 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.610
 it's on the internet that you do 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.990
 know exactly six years ago he 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.780
 was not all this emergence of 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.680
 this new youtube media contributed 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.880
 a little 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.070
 also to facilitate the emergence of youtube 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.930
 like a chain and like all that we have 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.690
 a little filled all the blogs and all that 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.130
 so we kind of pioneered them 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.500
 matter that is to say that the first 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.240
 sensational images and all that one 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.630
 was a little in those times we knew 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.040
 and its facilities this emergence as 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.690
 I'm a little proud of that 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.220
 so it's handy when the dunk at the 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.830
 Half-Time games before during after 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.510
 it's in practice it depends of 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.060
 lots of things during the mid-time 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.770
 matches after where some of some 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.709
 events that have nothing to do 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.020
 also with the basketball with it 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.310
 can be to associate his image with 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.650
 big brands or so to go 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.070
 in neighborhoods where to socialize 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.540
 etc. 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.610
 so it can be out as in 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.260
 in short, there is no there is no 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.030
 restriction each year to guests 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.530
 choose news images from 2011 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.440
 apparently you are not very keen 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.660
 because this is what happened 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.700
 past is that help you for that yeah 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.170
 I'm not too late finally I'm not watching 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.270
 too much being too much TV me I'm not 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.880
 pick up a tony parker it speaks to you 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.220
 yeah that does not seem like a friend too 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.930
 finally a friend here we all know 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.180
 follows each other from near and far 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.950
 I like his career and 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.629
 its really got the idea to do some 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.340
 sport in a traditional way had 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:13.799
 not your thing that ben me I know that 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.870
 I played sports traditionally 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.930
 I played football until 2nd division 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.269
 a professional I did good too 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.120
 of the athletics blood authors hse t2 m 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.680
 18 anyway to know it and I like 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.959
 well all that is freedom and then that 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.719
 goes with the new urban culture the 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:34.180
 society a little bit that favors more 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:36.939
 things more instant things we have 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.919
 we would also like grown by the side 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:41.049
 particular individuals so all the 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:42.340
 world can now manufacture its 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:43.930
 image everyone can do these 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.569
 small small video mixer these small 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.010
 chains have powered his and 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.689
 capitalize on his name 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.889
 so there others 2012 in others 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:52.329
 actions and a tour is full of 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:54.129
 things in sight full of things returns 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:57.519
 in the United States also continue to 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:04:00.489
 facilitate this new discipline side 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:02.769
 kind take take this faculty 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.060
 to have to jump up to say good 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.560
 here are the young people and if you want 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.510
 jump or like me it must be necessary 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.620
 so train a lot of things 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.849
 what tends to distinguish you feet 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.540
 like you but watch and I will stay 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.129

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:18.519
 gifts and do not forget telment or die 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.849
