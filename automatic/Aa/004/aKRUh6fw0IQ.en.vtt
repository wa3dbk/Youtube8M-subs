00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.090
 yesterday 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.740
 hello to all how are you going 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.240
 found for a new video yet 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.140
 once at the water's edge this time 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.660
 I will introduce the word ap 85 f of 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.120
 in duo so it's a decoy type 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.770
 simply stack to animate by saying that in 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.530
 besides eight songs and obviously one 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.379
 works very well by bringing in linear 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.960
 so this is a lure that is 8.5 cm 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.699
 for about a weight of 9 to 11 g so 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.190
 with a more or less strict color 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.660
 there are different colors 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.910
 you will of course see in the 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.920
 description the link to buy it with 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.350
 staller who is worth about 20 euros 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.830
 so very very beautiful with very beautiful 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.780
 finishes 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.150
 it's time that will allow you to 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.930
 pay different pike fish the 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:06.060
 black-bass boom also rock stoner a 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.530
 animated say about the 28 years will 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.940
 well really provoked the attacked 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.130
 so we will go directly to 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.040
 the animation so obviously adapted 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.270
 the weight of your lure with the 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.409
 power of your 4 so gladly 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.360
 it's time that comes to life 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.040
 that in or just support you 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.670
 put your cane low enough as if 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.050
 if and you animated it like that so what 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.790
 will do that theirs he'll he's going to do 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:35.220
 like this with flash effects due to 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.560
 painting that ensures on the all 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.120
 just that will cause the tacc 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.940
 carnivorous so I advise you to 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.590
 fish how generally I got 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.200
 many results 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.970
 when I find a bang of fry that is 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.430
 made to hunt that is to say that it's ok 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.130
 really cause a kind of 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.080
 fish leaking in agreement with the image 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.670
 very erratic and it really works 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.550
 of course the predators its 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.230
 programming the table and more 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.920
 really light effects in 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.920
 the other is beautiful 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.940
 the switch and the dr so simply 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.959
 the tweet is a little faster 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.060
 really do not hesitate to do some 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.170
 breaks agree to make big 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.300
 pause it means you spend the 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.010
 alba band is a break and there you know 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.560
 you speed up okay it can be 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:24.910
 really can really summon d 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:27.880
 huge results so say bay well 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.620
 obviously to fish in places 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.330
 more or less deep that is to say that 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.459
 this secular lure goes down not below 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.750
 of 3 meters from a body even to put I 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.790
 will say because according to the bib in 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.200
 actually there are jets that have 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.820
 much longer bibs that 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.590
 go down much deeper but 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.390
 I usually when I take 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.390
 sheaves and it does not go down in May cube 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:52.470
 So here it was at least 85 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:03:05.640
 duo I leave you 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:03:08.480
 very soon this is a boom or at 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.480
 less 85 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.830
 on the other hand to get the rest of the game 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.120
 percept 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.079
 There you go 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.680
 and
