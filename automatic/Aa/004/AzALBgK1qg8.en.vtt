your tutorial on the reverse Kong vault

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:18.670 
your tutorial on the reverse Kong vault
now<00:00:17.450> you<00:00:17.509> actually<00:00:17.779> don't<00:00:18.110> need<00:00:18.259> to<00:00:18.380> know<00:00:18.500> that

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
Kong vault to learn this trick but you

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.659 
Kong vault to learn this trick but you
actually<00:00:20.630> want<00:00:20.810> to<00:00:20.990> learn<00:00:21.169> the<00:00:21.349> -<00:00:21.560> vault<00:00:21.860> so<00:00:22.250> be

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:22.669 
actually want to learn the - vault so be

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:24.220 
actually want to learn the - vault so be
sure<00:00:22.700> to<00:00:22.849> check<00:00:23.119> out<00:00:23.240> my<00:00:23.329> tutorial<00:00:23.509> on<00:00:23.840> the<00:00:23.990> -

vault<00:00:24.500> if<00:00:24.739> you<00:00:24.919> haven't<00:00:25.130> learned<00:00:25.279> that<00:00:25.369> trick

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:25.700 
vault if you haven't learned that trick

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.269 
vault if you haven't learned that trick
yet<00:00:25.970> but<00:00:26.480> otherwise<00:00:26.750> let's<00:00:27.439> get<00:00:27.590> started<00:00:27.980> so

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
yet but otherwise let's get started so

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:29.769 
yet but otherwise let's get started so
the<00:00:28.309> reverse<00:00:28.610> Kong<00:00:28.880> is<00:00:29.059> actually<00:00:29.180> a<00:00:29.419> simple

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
the reverse Kong is actually a simple

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.630 
the reverse Kong is actually a simple
move<00:00:29.960> if<00:00:30.140> you<00:00:30.380> already<00:00:30.529> know<00:00:30.919> how<00:00:31.099> to<00:00:31.130> do<00:00:31.340> the<00:00:31.460> -

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
move if you already know how to do the -

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.819 
move if you already know how to do the -
balls<00:00:31.910> because<00:00:32.090> and<00:00:32.450> basically<00:00:33.110> it's<00:00:33.469> doing

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
balls because and basically it's doing

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.069 
balls because and basically it's doing
the<00:00:33.950> -<00:00:34.190> vault<00:00:34.520> where<00:00:34.730> you<00:00:34.820> jump<00:00:35.149> and<00:00:35.360> you<00:00:35.840> bring

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 
the - vault where you jump and you bring

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:37.630 
the - vault where you jump and you bring
your<00:00:36.260> feet<00:00:36.469> up<00:00:36.530> in<00:00:36.770> front<00:00:37.010> of<00:00:37.100> you<00:00:37.219> slightly

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
your feet up in front of you slightly

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.670 
your feet up in front of you slightly
leaning<00:00:37.879> back<00:00:38.180> but<00:00:38.840> with<00:00:38.960> the<00:00:39.050> reverse<00:00:39.350> conch

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
leaning back but with the reverse conch

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.040 
leaning back but with the reverse conch
instead<00:00:40.429> of<00:00:40.579> planting<00:00:41.390> your<00:00:41.480> hands<00:00:41.839> behind

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
instead of planting your hands behind

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.540 
instead of planting your hands behind
you<00:00:42.379> you're<00:00:42.530> actually<00:00:42.829> going<00:00:42.949> to<00:00:43.039> turn<00:00:43.249> and<00:00:43.460> do

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
you you're actually going to turn and do

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.119 
you you're actually going to turn and do
a<00:00:43.579> 180<00:00:43.879> turn<00:00:44.120> and<00:00:44.600> plant<00:00:45.199> your<00:00:45.320> hands<00:00:45.589> this<00:00:45.859> way

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
a 180 turn and plant your hands this way

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.399 
a 180 turn and plant your hands this way
and<00:00:46.399> push<00:00:46.999> off<00:00:47.239> like<00:00:47.659> you<00:00:47.780> would<00:00:47.929> a<00:00:47.960> round<00:00:48.230> off

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:48.409 
and push off like you would a round off

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:50.649 
and push off like you would a round off
there's<00:00:49.129> also<00:00:49.309> two<00:00:49.609> ways<00:00:49.640> to<00:00:49.969> jump<00:00:50.210> into<00:00:50.510> this

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:50.659 
there's also two ways to jump into this

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:52.869 
there's also two ways to jump into this
trick<00:00:50.960> so<00:00:51.530> if<00:00:51.890> I'm<00:00:52.100> rotating<00:00:52.460> to<00:00:52.730> the<00:00:52.789> left

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
trick so if I'm rotating to the left

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:54.610 
trick so if I'm rotating to the left
which<00:00:53.329> is<00:00:53.359> the<00:00:53.510> way<00:00:53.839> I'm<00:00:53.989> comfortable<00:00:54.469> doing

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
which is the way I'm comfortable doing

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.619 
which is the way I'm comfortable doing
it<00:00:54.890> I<00:00:55.010> can<00:00:55.399> either<00:00:55.489> jump<00:00:55.789> off<00:00:55.969> my<00:00:56.179> right<00:00:56.390> foot

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
it I can either jump off my right foot

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.720 
it I can either jump off my right foot
or<00:00:56.809> my<00:00:57.019> left<00:00:57.260> foot<00:00:57.469> if<00:00:57.859> I<00:00:57.920> jump<00:00:58.190> off<00:00:58.280> my<00:00:58.519> right

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
or my left foot if I jump off my right

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.729 
or my left foot if I jump off my right
foot<00:00:58.999> I'm<00:00:59.479> going<00:00:59.629> to<00:00:59.719> kind<00:00:59.899> of<00:00:59.989> kick<00:01:00.260> this<00:01:00.440> leg

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
foot I'm going to kind of kick this leg

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.549 
foot I'm going to kind of kick this leg
out<00:01:00.920> to<00:01:01.640> allow<00:01:01.909> me<00:01:02.089> to<00:01:02.269> position<00:01:02.809> my<00:01:02.960> body<00:01:03.229> just

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
out to allow me to position my body just

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.950 
out to allow me to position my body just
spin<00:01:04.280> around<00:01:04.400> and<00:01:04.729> get<00:01:04.850> the<00:01:05.000> half<00:01:05.210> turn<00:01:05.479> if<00:01:05.840> I

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
spin around and get the half turn if I

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.020 
spin around and get the half turn if I
jump<00:01:06.229> with<00:01:06.560> my<00:01:06.710> left<00:01:06.950> leg<00:01:07.070> then<00:01:07.760> I'm<00:01:07.880> just

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
jump with my left leg then I'm just

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.210 
jump with my left leg then I'm just
kicking<00:01:08.270> my<00:01:08.540> leg<00:01:08.750> around<00:01:09.020> this<00:01:09.260> way<00:01:09.530> and

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
kicking my leg around this way and

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.190 
kicking my leg around this way and
pushing<00:01:10.610> like<00:01:10.729> that<00:01:10.970> as<00:01:11.210> you<00:01:11.780> plant<00:01:12.079> your

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
pushing like that as you plant your

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.600 
pushing like that as you plant your
hands<00:01:12.560> you<00:01:12.799> just<00:01:12.979> want<00:01:13.159> to<00:01:13.219> make<00:01:13.340> sure<00:01:13.369> you

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
hands you just want to make sure you

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.459 
hands you just want to make sure you
spot<00:01:13.909> the<00:01:14.090> ground<00:01:14.180> and<00:01:14.570> you<00:01:14.960> can<00:01:14.990> either<00:01:15.229> land

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:15.469 
spot the ground and you can either land

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:17.139 
spot the ground and you can either land
backwards<00:01:15.979> with<00:01:16.130> this<00:01:16.310> trick<00:01:16.549> or<00:01:16.759> you<00:01:16.790> can

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
backwards with this trick or you can

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:18.730 
backwards with this trick or you can
keep<00:01:17.329> your<00:01:17.390> momentum<00:01:17.780> with<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:18.259> spin<00:01:18.500> going

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
keep your momentum with the spin going

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.249 
keep your momentum with the spin going
and<00:01:19.070> end<00:01:19.579> up<00:01:19.729> landing<00:01:19.909> forward<00:01:20.390> again<00:01:20.630> to<00:01:21.079> keep

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
and end up landing forward again to keep

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:21.609 
and end up landing forward again to keep
going

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
going

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:23.830 
going
so<00:01:22.189> progression<00:01:22.790> you<00:01:22.880> can<00:01:23.060> use<00:01:23.270> when<00:01:23.570> learning

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
so progression you can use when learning

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.539 
so progression you can use when learning
this<00:01:23.960> trick<00:01:24.170> is<00:01:24.439> you<00:01:24.590> first<00:01:24.799> want<00:01:25.100> to<00:01:25.189> at<00:01:25.490> least

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
this trick is you first want to at least

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.219 
this trick is you first want to at least
have<00:01:25.909> the<00:01:25.939> -<00:01:26.210> vault<00:01:26.479> learn<00:01:26.689> which<00:01:26.930> you<00:01:27.049> can

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
have the - vault learn which you can

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:28.870 
have the - vault learn which you can
watch<00:01:27.409> the<00:01:27.619> tutorial<00:01:28.130> for<00:01:28.280> the<00:01:28.340> progression

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
on learning the - ball once you have

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.289 
on learning the - ball once you have
that<00:01:30.979> you're<00:01:31.219> going<00:01:31.430> to<00:01:31.460> practice<00:01:31.939> the<00:01:32.090> -

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
that you're going to practice the -

vault but you're actually going to start
leaning<00:01:34.430> to<00:01:34.700> one<00:01:34.729> side<00:01:34.909> almost<00:01:35.479> doing

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
leaning to one side almost doing

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549

you're<00:02:00.530> really<00:02:00.829> throwing<00:02:01.280> that<00:02:01.460> -<00:02:01.700> Balt<00:02:01.969> like

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
you're really throwing that - Balt like

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.419 
you're really throwing that - Balt like
you<00:02:02.270> normally<00:02:02.479> would<00:02:02.630> and<00:02:03.189> rotating<00:02:04.189> with

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
you normally would and rotating with

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:05.889 
you normally would and rotating with
that<00:02:04.609> motion<00:02:04.880> so<00:02:05.210> that<00:02:05.359> you're<00:02:05.509> leaning<00:02:05.869> back

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
that motion so that you're leaning back

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:07.649 
that motion so that you're leaning back
and<00:02:06.409> as<00:02:06.530> you<00:02:06.649> turn<00:02:06.859> you're<00:02:07.159> all

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
and as you turn you're all

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.410 
and as you turn you're all
in<00:02:07.899> this<00:02:08.530> position<00:02:08.770> to<00:02:09.220> push<00:02:09.429> away<00:02:09.729> you're

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
in this position to push away you're

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.059 
in this position to push away you're
leaning<00:02:10.720> too<00:02:10.899> far<00:02:10.929> forward<00:02:11.440> when<00:02:11.739> you<00:02:11.830> turn

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
leaning too far forward when you turn

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.190 
leaning too far forward when you turn
then<00:02:12.760> you<00:02:12.910> won't<00:02:13.120> be<00:02:13.239> able<00:02:13.360> to<00:02:13.480> get<00:02:13.660> proper

push on the reverse so if you're

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.780 
push on the reverse so if you're
struggling<00:02:17.170> to<00:02:17.470> get<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.800> proper<00:02:18.160> rotation<00:02:18.700> on
