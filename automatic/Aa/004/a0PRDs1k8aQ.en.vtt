00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.500
 and good morning good afternoon I am Yankee 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.430
 of the technical channel style we are doing 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:34.790
 the second part of the video review of 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:38.610
 cellular samsung galaxy cores 2 the g3 55 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:42.600
 in this second part I bring the review 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.460
 from the camera I have a couple of recordings 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.970
 of some photographs that taken for 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.970
 that can 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:55.240
 so you can not see the quality of the 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:58.180
 camera so they can compare 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:02.370
 we started with the first video 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.370
 well this is a night recording 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:10.479
 when they finish using 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:14.229
 as you can see if it does not have great 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:16.330
 great quality is quite acceptable for 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.740
 the little lighting that was in the 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.439
 adjustments as you see are changing 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:25.270
 it is automatically fully visible 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:26.950
 so I would give it as a good video 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.049
 You also have the option to activate the 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.750
 flash if you want to record with flash if it is 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.970
 Very dark is recommended but not 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:38.040
 will give a very distance 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.040
 a very broad scope more 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:44.050
 but for example here I will go to the 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.060
 street and external luminaires the 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.630
 public luminaires looks pretty 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.630
 wind 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.050
 quite accept the video 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:00.390
 now we go with another 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.390
 I had an engraver in my house 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.270
 well we are already in my house 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.399
 should 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.100
 here we can see some flowers of my 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.790
 plum 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:17.150
 what is the video recording up close 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.430
 as you can see it has a very bad focus of 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.810
 near 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.780
 about here it 's almost done 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.090
 one meter 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.390
 the colors as they look good 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.080
 automatically changing values ​​of 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.120
 did 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.140
 is quickly adapting to the 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:40.580
 different lighting conditions 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:43.000
 I liked it enough for server I do not know about 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.000
 Homemade videos 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.499
 the colors look pretty good 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:51.480
 light changes as sudden but 

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:56.129
 for a cell phone it's just fine 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:59.780
 record in 720 x 480 does not reach to be hd 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.780
 but it's better than a pga 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.430
 although video is not the big deal 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.370
 I can not applaud how much 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.280
 if we are going to see that in photography the 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:17.010
 camera is pretty good especially 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.010
 with the photos close up with the maps 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.920
 on video works pretty well 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.690
 and now let's go with the photographs 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.790
 and I took this picture in my work 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:46.920
 fully automatic as you can see 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.920
 respects the warm colors of the spotlights 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:54.750
 good a general picture but good less 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:57.580
 outdoors now with no flash and 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.850
 then with the flash 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:04.900
 and good this first photo is the trade 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:07.840
 of work taken at night without light and without 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.640
 flash the office with the lights off 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.250
 the light that you see in the luminaire 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.460
 outside the public luminaire as 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.000
 they can see the image quite poor 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:21.190
 we go with another 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.190
 and this is the same office 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.139
 as you can see this picture is taken 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.710
 with the flash you see everything pretty much 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.710
 more clear 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.460
 forgive the dirty 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.160
 it is an office by 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:42.080
 but also the colors the image is 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:45.110
 good and now let's see another picture 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.110
 taken with 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:52.580
 the same office all the same but with the 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.580
 night photo mode 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.680
 and good thing we see is that the image is 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.289
 see much more clearly 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:05.180
 but we can immediately notice that it is 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:06.249
 a big increase in crime but for 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.179
 do 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:11.889
 a photo with cell phone is fine the best 

00:05:10.179 --> 00:05:14.799
 would always use the flash in this case 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:18.490
 but it seems the night is good to know 

00:05:14.799 --> 00:05:20.650
 that you can count on that high 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.440
 especially for landscapes for 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:26.700
 landscapes in low light 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:29.160
 let's see other photos 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:32.340
 well here we can see a picture 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:35.100
 taken in the afternoon in the field the 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.750
 missing out on precious moment is not 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:40.740
 I understood it was cloudy so no 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:43.950
 we can have a vision with the light of 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.660
 sun but the white balance is 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.850
 pretty good 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:52.460
 that is to say he performed well the 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.460
 white so everything was pretty good 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.620
 I wish these photos are strangled 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.390
 he also takes it in the field some 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.490
 very high friends 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:04.770
 and says this picture at an angle in 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:07.530
 perspective as you can see the hands of 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.530
 my uncle up are a little fuzzy 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:14.449
 they are moved even though there was this light 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:16.770
 but still good good image is achieved 

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:19.319
 when it looks pretty good 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:22.310
 and that's why they are doing the photos of 

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:22.310
 macro with this camera 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:28.589
 and to finish we have a series of 

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:30.650
 photos taken from hands of flowers leaves 

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:31.810
 plants 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.100
 that I took them not the garden of my house 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.870
 how can you see the fort of this bed 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:39.460
 of just the sea ​​with a lot of detail 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.460
 Much pain I liked 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:45.740
 good camera for photographs for video 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:49.100
 regular but he also wants quality 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:51.890
 the 17 20 480 the many but the 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:56.530
 5 megapixel photography you get very 

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:56.530
 good photos as you can see 

00:06:56.889 --> 00:07:03.940
 well with this we finished the second 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:06.130
 final part of the unboxing and meeting 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:09.070
 in the samsung galaxy core 2 camera 

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:12.760
 I hope you liked it and subscribe 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:15.940

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:17.800
