 Hello my good in this video I 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.429
 I would like to tell you and show my 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.530
 recent purchases 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:12.840
 several packages and my presents 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.179
 which I brought from Germany now 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.330
 show quick little presents that I 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:22.020
 brought from Germany this cosmetics to 3 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.710
 so let me show you and share 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.460
 summit 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.260
 products that I received as a gift 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.679
 so the first product which i am very 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.160
 I wanted to love in the essence 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.879
 it is white friable powder ordinary duck 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:48.050
 here fixing powder she goes 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:51.170
 here is such a prime and fine here goes 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.940
 11 grams is a lot of product here 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:57.930
 protective film and the powder itself looks 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.840
 just white with her is very easy 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.660
 go too far so you need to control 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.479
 the amount of powder that you collect 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.000
 on the brush and so I really like 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:11.460
 absolutely pleased matirova face in 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.650
 during the day that is, I fix 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.460
 foundation this particular powder and 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.110
 all day I go with a dull face therefore 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.570
 I am very pleased with everything I can 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.939
 give advice 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:28.140
 the next product with which unfortunately 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.350
 I did not guess a little bit with that shade 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.689
 ordered 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:37.170
 0 10 shade but since it was not 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:40.049
 they decided to give me a shade 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.150
 rowdy without it goes a little pink 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.759
 a bit dark 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.009
 spring summer ahead so i think 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.320
 very soon I will start using it 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.509
 I tried to apply it to me very 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.619
 like good coverage it's like me 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.619
 I love dense coverage 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.430
 good by the way mounts my oily skin 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.180
 so for oily skin too 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.780
 give advice 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:09.490
 I like very good girls 20 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:12.530
 keeps analysis very good pump 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.720
 You can squeeze as much product as 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.110
 you need therefore yes here's such 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.280
 concealer 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:24.020
 the following is what i wanted from the catrice brand 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.260
 it is a palette of concealers 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:30.800
 here 5 shades I think everyone has already seen 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.760
 and know how these concealer look like 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:37.030
 Here are the shades of glasses most often I use 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:41.030
 here is this shade because he 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.580
 best suited for me under the zone 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.370
 eyes too as you can see 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.700
 use a green tint for 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.870
 overlap 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:53.150
 and overlap redness that is if there is 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.250
 some kind of inflammation for example i go 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.250
 redness around the nose after i 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.700
 I rub my face with a tonic so I am thin 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.010
 I apply a layer of green concealer and he 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.620
 well covers the red and here 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:11.840
 hides all the flaws a little dry 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:14.570
 but so basically I'm happy and last 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.390
 The product that I brought from Germany 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:20.450
 a gift it was a brow set 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:24.019
 very pleased with this set he goes 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.360
 so small compact and here goes 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:29.000
 which is very convenient mirror that's all 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.540
 lid and shade themselves go here 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.220
 I am working on that color 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.150
 side of gravity you whith inner 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.769
 eyebrow corner 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.700
 light shade and then I work 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:44.660
 here's this eyebrow 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:47.180
 dark so that's gray brown tint 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.420
 very nice neutral hotel but 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.940
 for 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.840
 for example dark girls like me he 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.750
 little svetlov 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.150
 so I often mix it with 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.849
 black shade of the shadows in this set 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.250
 goes still really do not like taking this 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:04.319

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:16.560
 very happy to give way to one 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:18.000
 Naborchik's house is absolutely calm enough 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.860
 in order to work 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.750
 pluck and paint over the edge so I 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.360
 very happy he does not like it but 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.160
 if there was a shade a little bit darker 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.090
 it would be a whole day with gifts 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.740
 finished probably go to the purchase 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.720

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.660

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:32.820

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:35.039
 here and on this product i 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.979
 I was pleased with everything I can advise 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:41.789
 especially for owners of oily skin 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:42.510
 The following purchases will be lacquer purchases 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:46.530
 for nails 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:48.720
 I bought three varnishes like this 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:51.100
 now spring wanted bright colors i 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.260
 decided to update my collection 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.900
 nail polishes and add to them 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.430
 a little brightness and so i bought three 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.730
 varnish shade 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:05.070
 I bought one easy and good 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:10.240
 nail polish is so cold 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:12.270
 pink pale shade of varnish is very me 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.340
 I like how it looks on the nails 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:17.200
 slightly lightens the nail plate for 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:20.160
 the expense of this nails seems even more 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:23.410
 well maintained and such know after 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:29.260
 salon manicure really like too 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:31.930
 often use moan number 110 easy and 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:34.960
 good it is on sale on mine I bought in 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:37.900
 the store open space next shades 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:43.650
 this is such a foxy shade straight to me 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:47.290
 under a T-shirt lacquer shoes 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:50.140
 540 from the company jardin 

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:52.450
 shade it is very bright and I am very 

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:54.070
 like the quality of these varnishes in two layers 

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:56.380
 it completely covers the nail 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:58.390
 Nepal's plate is worn today 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:00.850
 two or three days that is on my nails this 

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:04.950
 principle is normal therefore not very 

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:04.950
 like the color in the mask 

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:11.500
 next lacquer too is such a beautiful 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:13.210
 coral red tint on camera he 

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:16.560
 the pink card is actually such 

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:23.020
 torrent stomachs and shade beautiful it 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:25.330
 second shade and brand of stars from 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:28.930
 Ukrainian brand I do not know the brand 

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:30.490
 Russia is unlikely he is therefore the second ones 

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.740
 I really like the guard too 

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:34.630
 quality go varnishes in one layer 

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:37.300
 completely covers the nail plate 

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:40.870
 but since I like saturated colors 

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:44.220
 so I always apply in two layers 

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:45.700
 Basically, all my purchases and gifts
