another reason to hate on wolves the
werewolf<00:00:54.309> I<00:00:56.730> guess<00:00:57.730> this<00:00:58.000> is<00:00:58.149> when<00:00:58.390> regular

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
werewolf I guess this is when regular

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:00.919 
werewolf I guess this is when regular
wolves<00:00:59.350> just<00:00:59.590> aren't<00:00:59.920> big<00:01:00.129> and<00:01:00.280> bad<00:01:00.370> enough

00:01:00.919 --> 00:01:00.929 
wolves just aren't big and bad enough

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:04.079 
wolves just aren't big and bad enough
look<00:01:01.929> the<00:01:02.440> point<00:01:02.649> is<00:01:02.859> wolves<00:01:03.640> have<00:01:03.760> gotten<00:01:04.030> a

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
look the point is wolves have gotten a

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.810 
look the point is wolves have gotten a
bad<00:01:04.300> rap<00:01:04.690> over<00:01:05.050> the<00:01:05.080> years<00:01:05.440> and<00:01:05.650> we<00:01:06.160> need<00:01:06.580> to

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
bad rap over the years and we need to

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.800 
bad rap over the years and we need to
set<00:01:07.150> the<00:01:07.420> record<00:01:07.630> straight<00:01:09.330> only<00:01:10.330> a<00:01:10.540> few

extinction today we know that wolves are
a<00:01:37.729> vital<00:01:38.270> part<00:01:38.509> of<00:01:38.600> the<00:01:38.689> healthy<00:01:39.020> ecosystem<00:01:39.890> so

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
a vital part of the healthy ecosystem so

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.069 
a vital part of the healthy ecosystem so
our<00:01:40.579> improved<00:01:40.939> understanding<00:01:41.659> of<00:01:41.750> what<00:01:41.899> makes

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
our improved understanding of what makes

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.789 
our improved understanding of what makes
a<00:01:42.170> wolf<00:01:42.409> a<00:01:42.590> wolf<00:01:42.829> is<00:01:43.490> equally<00:01:43.969> vital<00:01:44.619> to<00:01:45.619> get<00:01:45.770> a

a wolf a wolf is equally vital to get a

a wolf a wolf is equally vital to get a
better<00:01:46.009> handle<00:01:46.310> on<00:01:46.549> wolves<00:01:47.060> let's<00:01:47.450> start<00:01:47.719> with

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
better handle on wolves let's start with

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.620 
better handle on wolves let's start with
something<00:01:48.109> we<00:01:48.319> all<00:01:48.590> know<00:01:48.890> and<00:01:49.069> understand

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
something we all know and understand

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.020 
something we all know and understand
believe<00:01:50.630> it<00:01:50.869> or<00:01:50.990> not<00:01:51.109> all<00:01:51.490> dogs<00:01:52.490> are

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
believe it or not all dogs are

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.679 
believe it or not all dogs are
descendants<00:01:53.990> of<00:01:54.140> wolves<00:01:54.789> yes<00:01:55.789> even<00:01:56.299> this<00:01:56.420> one

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
descendants of wolves yes even this one

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:58.899 
descendants of wolves yes even this one
so<00:01:57.140> let's<00:01:57.380> start<00:01:57.679> with<00:01:57.829> what<00:01:58.009> we<00:01:58.159> know<00:01:58.369> just

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
so let's start with what we know just

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.749 
so let's start with what we know just
like<00:01:59.090> dogs<00:01:59.329> wolves<00:02:00.170> are<00:02:00.379> smart<00:02:00.770> though<00:02:01.520> when

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
like dogs wolves are smart though when

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.969 
like dogs wolves are smart though when
it<00:02:01.879> comes<00:02:02.090> to<00:02:02.239> surviving<00:02:02.840> in<00:02:02.929> the<00:02:03.049> wild<00:02:03.229> wolves

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
it comes to surviving in the wild wolves

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.410 
it comes to surviving in the wild wolves

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
to use the same thinking power as a wolf

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.640 
to use the same thinking power as a wolf
out<00:02:20.390> in<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.599> wild<00:02:20.900> because<00:02:21.200> they<00:02:21.410> don't<00:02:21.590> have

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
out in the wild because they don't have

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:25.579 
wild wolf then there are the physical

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.240 
wild wolf then there are the physical
differences<00:02:26.090> now<00:02:26.450> this<00:02:27.290> guy<00:02:27.530> is<00:02:27.590> very

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
differences now this guy is very

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.860 
differences now this guy is very
different<00:02:28.730> from<00:02:28.849> his<00:02:29.030> wolf<00:02:29.209> cousins<00:02:29.660> in<00:02:29.780> a

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
different from his wolf cousins in a

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.110 
different from his wolf cousins in a
variety<00:02:30.019> of<00:02:30.440> ways<00:02:30.680> but<00:02:31.310> what<00:02:31.700> about<00:02:31.880> bigger

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
variety of ways but what about bigger

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.949 
variety of ways but what about bigger
dogs<00:02:32.389> like<00:02:32.660> German<00:02:33.049> Shepherds<00:02:33.500> or<00:02:33.650> Huskies

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
dogs like German Shepherds or Huskies

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.360 
dogs like German Shepherds or Huskies
well<00:02:35.959> they<00:02:36.079> are<00:02:36.200> similar<00:02:36.500> but<00:02:36.799> there<00:02:37.069> are<00:02:37.190> some

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
well they are similar but there are some

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.559 
well they are similar but there are some
major<00:02:37.489> attributes<00:02:38.000> that<00:02:38.150> set<00:02:38.359> them<00:02:38.480> apart

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
major attributes that set them apart

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.170 
major attributes that set them apart
will<00:02:39.290> generally<00:02:39.739> have<00:02:39.859> stronger<00:02:40.220> jaws<00:02:40.519> wider

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
will generally have stronger jaws wider

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.059 
will generally have stronger jaws wider
legs<00:02:41.480> and<00:02:41.780> more<00:02:42.170> strength<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:42.590> stamina<00:02:42.739> all

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
legs and more strength and stamina all

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:44.890 
legs and more strength and stamina all
the<00:02:43.250> way<00:02:43.340> around<00:02:43.579> now<00:02:43.819> think<00:02:44.540> of<00:02:44.630> what<00:02:44.690> we

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
the way around now think of what we

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.569 
the way around now think of what we
expect<00:02:45.200> from<00:02:45.319> our<00:02:45.410> domestic<00:02:45.919> dogs<00:02:46.130> maybe<00:02:46.459> a

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
expect from our domestic dogs maybe a

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.490 
expect from our domestic dogs maybe a
little<00:02:46.730> game<00:02:46.970> of<00:02:47.120> catch<00:02:47.359> maybe<00:02:47.810> some<00:02:48.169> frisbee

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
little game of catch maybe some frisbee

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.849 
little game of catch maybe some frisbee
oh<00:02:48.829> okay

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:50.859 
oh okay

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:52.780 
oh okay
but<00:02:51.859> there's<00:02:52.010> a<00:02:52.069> big<00:02:52.280> difference<00:02:52.519> between

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
but there's a big difference between

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.539 
but there's a big difference between
landing<00:02:53.299> this<00:02:53.450> and<00:02:53.780> landing<00:02:54.739> an<00:02:54.829> elk

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:02.289

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
if I'm a wolf I need to keep my edge I

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:06.640 
if I'm a wolf I need to keep my edge I
need<00:03:03.169> the<00:03:03.260> extra<00:03:03.500> power<00:03:03.620> I<00:03:04.340> needed<00:03:05.269> or<00:03:05.660> it<00:03:05.780> why

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
need the extra power I needed or it why

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.490 
need the extra power I needed or it why
well<00:03:07.579> it's<00:03:08.030> simple<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.870> things<00:03:09.079> I<00:03:09.260> like<00:03:09.470> to

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
well it's simple the things I like to

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.690 
well it's simple the things I like to
