wanted to come to show you guys what
products<00:00:05.640> I<00:00:05.759> used<00:00:06.029> to<00:00:06.240> meet<00:00:06.390> a<00:00:06.660> my<00:00:06.899> hair<00:00:07.200> now<00:00:07.770> I

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
products I used to meet a my hair now I

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.820 
products I used to meet a my hair now I
had<00:00:08.190> dyed<00:00:08.520> my<00:00:08.820> hair<00:00:08.850> about<00:00:09.510> a<00:00:09.540> month<00:00:09.900> ago<00:00:10.050> and

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.830 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.849 

to<00:00:13.830> maintain<00:00:14.340> this<00:00:14.550> color<00:00:14.940> it's<00:00:15.810> really<00:00:16.080> hard

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
to maintain this color it's really hard

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.429 
to maintain this color it's really hard
I<00:00:17.189> think<00:00:17.820> that<00:00:18.179> if<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.390> don't<00:00:18.630> wash<00:00:18.869> it<00:00:18.900> the

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
I think that if you don't wash it the

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.130 
I think that if you don't wash it the
colors<00:00:19.740> stay<00:00:20.039> in<00:00:20.220> better<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:20.789> have<00:00:21.390> locks<00:00:21.689> so<00:00:22.109> I

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
colors stay in better I have locks so I

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.599 
colors stay in better I have locks so I
don't<00:00:22.589> need<00:00:22.829> to<00:00:23.039> wash<00:00:23.279> my<00:00:23.310> hair<00:00:23.759> as<00:00:23.970> much<00:00:24.439> as

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
don't need to wash my hair as much as

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.099 
don't need to wash my hair as much as
probably<00:00:26.609> let's<00:00:26.909> save<00:00:27.240> someone<00:00:27.779> who<00:00:27.929> it's

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
probably let's save someone who it's

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.720 
probably let's save someone who it's
natural<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.829> put<00:00:29.009> a<00:00:29.039> lot<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.279> products<00:00:29.640> in

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
natural and put a lot of products in

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.460 
natural and put a lot of products in
their<00:00:29.970> hair<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.390> don't<00:00:30.659> put<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:30.929> lot<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.169> products

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
their hair I don't put a lot of products

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.220 
their hair I don't put a lot of products
in<00:00:31.589> my<00:00:31.679> hair<00:00:31.919> and<00:00:32.070> I<00:00:32.670> don't<00:00:33.060> do<00:00:33.360> very<00:00:33.600> much<00:00:33.900> to

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
in my hair and I don't do very much to

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.550 
in my hair and I don't do very much to
it<00:00:34.380> however<00:00:35.330> I<00:00:36.330> will<00:00:36.690> include<00:00:37.050> some<00:00:37.260> pictures

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:37.560 
it however I will include some pictures

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.350 
it however I will include some pictures
at<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.770> end<00:00:37.800> so<00:00:38.220> you<00:00:38.250> can<00:00:38.370> see<00:00:38.550> what<00:00:39.060> the<00:00:39.150> true

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
at the end so you can see what the true

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.810 
at the end so you can see what the true
color<00:00:39.630> of<00:00:39.720> my<00:00:40.260> hair<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.650> and<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:40.860> think<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:41.370> on

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
color of my hair is and I think that on

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.530 
color of my hair is and I think that on
this<00:00:43.490> camera<00:00:44.490> you're<00:00:44.760> really<00:00:45.060> not<00:00:45.210> getting

this camera you're really not getting

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.260 
this camera you're really not getting
that<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.720> true<00:00:46.490> sense<00:00:47.490> of<00:00:47.580> the<00:00:47.640> color<00:00:47.910> cuz<00:00:48.120> it's

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
that a true sense of the color cuz it's

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.380 
that a true sense of the color cuz it's
really<00:00:48.330> really<00:00:48.870> red<00:00:49.400> ok<00:00:50.400> so<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.940> dyed<00:00:51.210> my<00:00:51.240> hair
