wanted to take a minute to make the

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.700 
wanted to take a minute to make the
journal<00:00:46.399> process<00:00:47.399> less<00:00:47.870> magical<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.530> more

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
real so this is one example of a

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.959 
real so this is one example of a
sketchbook<00:00:53.809> journal<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.050> how<00:00:56.010> it's<00:00:56.430> just<00:00:56.820> a

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
sketchbook journal and how it's just a

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.619 
sketchbook journal and how it's just a
little<00:00:57.300> drawing<00:00:58.079> pad<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.730> just<00:00:59.969> has<00:01:00.120> basic

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
little drawing pad and it just has basic

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.380 
little drawing pad and it just has basic
small<00:01:00.750> ideas<00:01:01.609> there's<00:01:02.609> another<00:01:02.910> one<00:01:03.180> my

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
favorite was given to me by a friend and

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.550 
favorite was given to me by a friend and

helpful to get stuff sort of lined out
in<00:01:37.619> your<00:01:37.829> head<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.430> these<00:01:38.820> little

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
composition books are the best things to

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.359 
composition books are the best things to
do<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.649> sketchbooks<00:01:43.649> can<00:01:43.890> look<00:01:44.159> all

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
do that sketchbooks can look all

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.249 
do that sketchbooks can look all
different<00:01:45.000> ways<00:01:45.710> borders<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:48.259> Barnes

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
different ways borders and and Barnes

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.580 
different ways borders and and Barnes
and<00:01:49.380> Nobles<00:01:49.680> have<00:01:49.920> lots<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:50.369> them<00:01:50.610> but<00:01:51.409> it's<00:01:52.409> a

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
and Nobles have lots of them but it's a

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.280 
and Nobles have lots of them but it's a
good<00:01:52.770> idea<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.430> get<00:01:53.880> ones<00:01:54.149> some<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.170> are

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
good idea to get ones some that are

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.889 
good idea to get ones some that are
bound<00:01:55.700> pretty<00:01:56.700> good<00:01:56.969> because<00:01:57.390> they<00:01:57.600> tend<00:01:57.840> to

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
bound pretty good because they tend to

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.080 
bound pretty good because they tend to
fall<00:01:58.079> apart<00:01:58.110> after<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.860> while<00:01:59.070> putting<00:02:00.000> the

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
fall apart after a while putting the

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.859 
fall apart after a while putting the
dates<00:02:00.420> also<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.930> good<00:02:01.079> idea<00:02:01.549> trying<00:02:02.549> out<00:02:03.060> paint

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
dates also a good idea trying out paint

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.800 
dates also a good idea trying out paint
colors<00:02:03.990> or<00:02:05.270> making<00:02:06.270> notes<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.719> yourself

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
colors or making notes to yourself

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.469 
colors or making notes to yourself
little<00:02:07.530> sketches

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
little sketches

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:18.280 
little sketches
I<00:02:13.030> think<00:02:14.030> that<00:02:14.299> a<00:02:14.980> lot<00:02:15.980> of<00:02:16.129> times<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:17.840> best<00:02:18.080> way

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
I think that a lot of times the best way

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.690 
I think that a lot of times the best way
for<00:02:18.680> me<00:02:18.950> to<00:02:18.980> sketch<00:02:19.549> is<00:02:20.030> to<00:02:20.890> have<00:02:21.890> an<00:02:22.010> idea<00:02:22.340> of

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
for me to sketch is to have an idea of

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.330 
for me to sketch is to have an idea of
something<00:02:23.629> that<00:02:23.989> I<00:02:24.049> want<00:02:24.319> to<00:02:24.379> work<00:02:24.650> on<00:02:24.890> and

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
something that I want to work on and

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.420 
something that I want to work on and
then<00:02:25.700> just<00:02:26.120> sort<00:02:26.930> of<00:02:27.140> sketch<00:02:27.500> little<00:02:27.980> things

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
then just sort of sketch little things

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.150 
then just sort of sketch little things
not<00:02:29.209> really<00:02:29.480> even<00:02:29.930> trying<00:02:30.230> to<00:02:30.440> get<00:02:30.560> a<00:02:30.620> finished

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
not really even trying to get a finished

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.729 
not really even trying to get a finished
drawing<00:02:31.459> just<00:02:31.849> to<00:02:32.299> sort<00:02:32.959> of<00:02:33.049> get<00:02:33.230> your<00:02:33.349> ideas

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
drawing just to sort of get your ideas

and later one of the things too that a

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.710 
and later one of the things too that a
good<00:02:42.010> thing<00:02:43.010> to<00:02:43.190> use<00:02:43.220> a<00:02:43.370> sketchbook<00:02:43.819> for<00:02:44.239> us<00:02:44.450> to

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
good thing to use a sketchbook for us to

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.660 
good thing to use a sketchbook for us to
try<00:02:44.930> out<00:02:44.959> different<00:02:45.310> materials<00:02:46.310> and

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670
