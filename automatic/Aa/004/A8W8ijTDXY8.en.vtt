00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560
 who is sporty is clear we have 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.700
 worked very hard for eight weeks now 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.700
 saturday everybody is happy 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.139
 on it and have us as a goal 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.610
 set to start successfully that is 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.690
 Of course we really want to win 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.080
 want the points rather in augsburg 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.429
 to let 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.379
 It certainly will not be easy 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.820
 task because newcomers come to us 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.460
 the one with a certain euphoria, too 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.500
 here he comes quality but has 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.670
 does not matter I would now in first game 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.890
 against every opponent we say want 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.859
 necessarily win because we are at the beginning 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.980
 just the preparation because positive 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.989
 want to coin and just euphoria with 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.579
 start a certain euphoria too 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.329
 want and want to worry about furore 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.100
 that is the great goal of cadres ago is 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.309
 Clear that the long-term injured 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.649
 missing like müllers or film and also 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.700
 here with ginger callsen bracker the with 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.010
 his knee still labored 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.600
 otherwise they are all fit and fit for action 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.039
 and there is the agony of choice if 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.010
 I hope we can do that 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.449
 make right decisions 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.309
 it will be decisive that we or 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.960
 not who plays but that we as 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.489
 team act as we 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.900
 team are successful 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.610
 not only on saturday against düsseldorf 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.100
 but for the whole season 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.439
 we have to stick together collectively 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.700
 we fight against the good opponents and 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.939
 with our fans in the back simply 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.049
 we constantly score points and us 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.799
 continuously evolve and 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.049
 Finally, I'm glad that on 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.790
 Saturday no team knows 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.670
 exactly where she is after the preparation 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.020
 and we also look motivated though 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.430
 on the other side or more 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.590
 if on the one hand bellinghausen 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.860
 and raphael we absolutely want to stand 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.420
 win and individual names we look 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.460
 not but it only counts in ours 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.960
 performance of our team and just 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.119
 that we keep the three points here 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.380
 it does not matter who on the 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.939
 Of course, the opposite side is playing a lot 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.500
 Good team you have with woronin 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.170
 committed to an excellent player 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.500
 the last years there really always 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.369
 has always worried for torgefahr and 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.939
 Exceptional player is you have to grab the handle 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.770
 to get 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.750
 and of course they have another good one 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.100
 player you have seen that yourself 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.479
 also have heavy handed against one 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.030
 third division but that others 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.459
 crews on the last weekend too 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.929
 and and it just does not apply to 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.569
 to let them come to fight them 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.270
 and ours on our own 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.830
 Strengthen to look and strengthen ours there 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.080
 and then I hope so 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.590
 that we are in front of düsseldorf at home 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.989
 beat 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.580
 yes it is not easy but I believe 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.780
 that's why he's the opponent too 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.730
 aware of the core of the coach 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.830
 past sets and defenses 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.560
 and center for example is still 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.030
 remained offensive maybe one 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.519
 Bisserl easier then reinstall 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.670
 but there are still some players left 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.250
 thereby of the rise and of course is the 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.269
 large number always difficult too 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.069
 integrate but I think that in the 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.650
 then run your time 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.450
 get opportunities 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.010
 fortuna düsseldorf then to help now 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.440
 we just look at the players on 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.790
 saturday and and the gases is natural 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.129
 that burghausen play who saw her 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.080
 We will know where you are strong 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:00.030
 are and where they have their weaknesses and 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.629
 which applies it easy to exploit 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.709
 Six games played in 16 days though 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.700
 speaks of a huge experience that 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.500
 I also believe with the bronze medal 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.470
 I hope that he is euphoric and and 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.720
 the fun he certainly with 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.459
 olympia had that he brings with them 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.110
 or brought to augsburg that 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.620
 he can also show that in the games 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.909
 he feels natural or not 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.790
 100 percent after the 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:25.890
 stress phase is clear who has now 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.110
 he gave me ten days no play 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.489
 happened charged we just have to go 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.319
 yesterday, 100 percent looked 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.569
 train until then for the weekend 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.159
 looks for the next one 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.330
 play games and the season for the whole one 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:38.069
 very important player for us 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.209
 I'm not looking at me but me 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.890
 look at the team that we 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.200
 have success and of course it is nice 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.459
 it's Bundesliga game on Saturday 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.049
 but I'm only interested then 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.390
 actually that we win the game 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.069
 that's the big thing about me 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.569
 interested and what we are looking for 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:55.830
 and of course with a certain 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:57.030
 voltage because then equipped 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.250
 because we are now seven eight weeks old 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.040
 have worked and I do not know 100 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.269
 percent where we stand there is none 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.370
 trainer and no team after 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:08.010
 preparation in the punktspielen becomes 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.560
 then many play 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.140
 things a role as one mentally it 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.610
 is a team and there if you have the 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.709
 Then finally know team 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.570
 learn as you do in tight situations 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.109
 how they hold together and whether 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.360
 the tight situations 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.939
 can decide for themselves because that is 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.590
 with certainty that we yes from 

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:29.650
 small things are dependent again and 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.479
 that is often only centimeters whether one 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.129
 is right or not and needs 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:34.719
 one then also the necessary luck the 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:36.939
 the base will be that the team 

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:38.259
 Everything is always safe then me 

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:39.189
 Of course we hope that we will 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:41.409
 also be rewarded 

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:45.340
 and of course finally again 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:46.449
 the question is looking forward to it and I'm hot 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.639
 also on it of course 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:51.699
 it is easy to surprise it again 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:53.590
 is so we're outsiders think 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:55.060
 that every expert in the 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.039
 past has called that and that it 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.740
 even so, that we have to stretch 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:01.539
 to be able to keep up with the competitors 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.210
 and there will be some teams again 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:05.979
 56 maybe give that to the 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.139
 descent fight with security 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.610
 augsburger a candidate but we want 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:12.039
 We want to grow out of ourselves again 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.539
 simply return to our performance limit 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:15.699
 come up with something great again 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:17.680
 reach and just three teams 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:20.259
 leave behind us then the huge 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.789
 Success because the proverb says that 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:24.520
 second, as you know, always the 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:26.529
 hardest is more difficult and believe that 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.210
 I know that it is also fact somewhere 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:31.210
 from the head one thinks that player 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.889
 manager reached in the last year and 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.919
 one is no longer underestimated with that 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:37.060
 safety other starting situation like 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:38.529
 she was the case last year 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.599
 we really want to win on saturday 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:42.039
 that's what I would say or have 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:43.569
 I said that before the draw 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:44.979
 We absolutely want the first game 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:46.870
 win no matter who we play 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:50.289
 Now it's düsseldorf and that's it 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.550
 the initial situation and favorit the 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:53.949
 I learned in football will not 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.270
 The paper decided it will be nothing 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:57.879
 Names decided that you can do it all 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:00.129
 first be played and you have to 

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:01.569
 simply as a team in the collective 

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:02.409
 sell well and then you have good 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:03.849
 to win chances 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:06.430
 We will not be the open knife 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:09.939
 run that is clear but is natural 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:11.480
 for the da and the will to win with 

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:14.570
 safety there too 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.250
 and we have to tackle that in a targeted way 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.050
 We have the strength to do it too 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.940
 Of course everything becomes defensive 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.460
 demanded that is also clear that the 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:25.370
 defensive is the base and we will 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.050
 Target it and discuss everything 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:30.730
 and of course I hope we can 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.730
 by coming back as well
