00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 how very good I am packard and today 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.890
 we are in a new tutorial video 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.620
 advanced of minecraft and in this video os 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.219
 I'm going to teach how to make doors 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.080
 secretly this is closed and it is 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.930
 open we have here our room 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.060
 I've only been able to learn for the moment 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.369
 that can only be opened from outside 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.910
 from within I still do not suppose that 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:29.320
 be very easy and we are going to do the 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.260
 circuit 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.240
 It is very easy 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:38.410
 do whatever a wall of 5 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.410
 5 x 4 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.770
 It's worth everything you want 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:51.649
 ok you put for example some lever 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.710
 you turn around so you're here is 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.980
 where it was white 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:00.210
 so it was worth below where it was lever 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.860
 you put a 1 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.490
 here you put 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:10.620
 2 with the bookstores is right now 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.620
 it would be open 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.210
 and let's see what we agree, I do not remember 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:26.110
 to see there is the lever is worth 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.110
 I'm wrong, wrong 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.420
 let's see let's make it a little bigger 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.740
 this wall because it will not get me 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:38.690
 5 instead of 4 to 6 7 x 4 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:42.130
 it's worth putting the lever 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.049
 there is bad in the fourth place 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.590
 What we have to do now because we 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:49.370
 here a piston 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.920
 another here 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:54.500
 we take one here and the other here 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.420
 down in stairway 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.080
 ok this is where the 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.510
 lever if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.510
 3 in the room 3 in the room 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.370
 it's worth this we unite 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.370
 do not 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:18.180
 walesa put this alone because this one does not 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.180
 it reaches the current 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:30.400
 It's worth it, it 's very long, we're 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:34.740
 far from this to get this you can 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.390
 simplify much more by putting 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:42.340
 to see this come out 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:44.819
 with the lever here here is already worth and 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.819
 it's closer 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.270
 and this is the mechanism I'm going to do 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:54.130
 here apart so that you already have it 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.130
 memory and help you good we do this 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.250
 this does not 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.920
 here sticky pistons bookstores 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.360
 I have used libraries can be of 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.310
 the same stone that is worth for 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:11.980
 camouflage still camouflages 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.160
 ok I'm stuck clearly like 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:18.130
 you can see and this 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:22.069
 it would open and enter asphalt 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:27.080
 then it is to make one here and another here 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:31.130
 ok if it turns out that the lever 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:34.010
 here you can put it here for the 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:37.840
 rest here if it turns out that you give me this is 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:41.709
 the lever here is here 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:45.790
 you put a square here reston here 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:47.660
 the unis paris subtract here 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.050
 valera dais 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.250
 and open 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:57.420
 It's that simple and it's that easy 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:59.410
 and nothing here we have in me the thing that I 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.310
 I've been there before 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:05.380
 It is worth knowing closes we enter a 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.860
 we can close we come here we give you 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:11.710
 here and we have another room worth this 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.630
 for a house it serves a lot so nothing 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.030
 we have here the mechanism go back to 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.670
 repeat shelves two pistons 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.400
 sticky 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:23.750
 one up here and one here are here 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.040
 down rest in here over unites 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.260
 we put remains 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.810
 a trick to know where the 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.110
 lever or to make contact with the 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.090
 lever because look 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.820
 I put here 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.810
 I put the lever and put down here the 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:44.449
 rest if I give him no effect 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.460
 it's worth as you see it does not light up or anything like that 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:48.860
 that you have to put a block here 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.320
 is on top and then the action is done 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.500
 it 's why I put me here blocks 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.500
 over 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.760
 mother 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.190
 and nothing I hope you liked that you 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.310
 has served that is the most important and 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.780
 nothing a greeting to all we subscribe give to 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.479
 I like it and favorites and see you in the 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:10.560
 next tutorial advanced until the 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:10.560
 next kids chao
