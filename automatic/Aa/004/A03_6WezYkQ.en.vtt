00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 the gasoline that comes to our daily life 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.210
 is the result of work that can 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.040
 to start more than 5 thousand meters 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.340
 depth in the ocean 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.170
 Have you ever imagined a long journey from this 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.480
 important gasoline fuel 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.640
 produced from petroleum 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.529
 the oil of fossil origin that takes millions 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.080
 of years to be formed in the rocks 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.000
 sedimentary many studies 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.789
 investments are involved in the 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.619
 drilling discovery and development 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.929
 of oil fields 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.480
 the fields already in production oil 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.430
 extracted separately on the platforms 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.440
 then transported to the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.840
 terminals on the Brazilian coast 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.940
 from there the oil goes to a 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.200
 refinery where it goes through three 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:49.710
 basic cold separation conversion and 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.570
 treating the separated oil is 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.680
 heated at high temperatures to 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.390
 evaporate 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.730
 this amount in the net state account 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.059
 as it cools at different levels 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.190
 inside the distillation tower in each 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.949
 level to the container that connect 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.760
 determine the by - products of petroleum 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.010
 I feel one of them gasoline the most 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.470
 heavy oil prices follow 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.020
 converted when they are converted into 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.689
 molecules and give rise to sub 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.909
 products including gasoline 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.520
 this increases the use of the 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.040
 oil and in the final stage 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.650
 among the actions taken is made 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.299
 removed from the great horn of the 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.610
 produced fuel 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.960
 this way the production of the 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.810
 ultra low sulfur gasoline 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.119
 this gasoline known as holder out 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.149
 refineries without any additives to 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.210
 several distributors throughout Brazil 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.680
 in all petrol distributors 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.020
 receives the addition of ethanol 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.270
 a book as well as being required by law 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.670
 this condition increases the octane 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.690
 fuel and helps lower emissions 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.210
 of pollutants 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.700
 the result comes from the common gasoline that 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.710
 we met at the filling stations 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.960
 distributors also produce the 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.539
 gasoline from the 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.540
 addition of detergents and dispersants to 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.250
 common gasoline are those additives which 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.070
 conserve the combustion system 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.510
 maintaining that the nozzles and the nozzles 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.750
 engine valves 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.280
 both common and additive gasolines 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.310
 leaving the distributors to finally 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.140
 reach the filling stations 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.450
 however the investment is present 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.640
 throughout the gasoline journey and where 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.040
 have the eye program stamp on the 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.440
 fuel can supply calm 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.989
 because it is a sign that the fuel has 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.989
 the quality tested by petrobras
