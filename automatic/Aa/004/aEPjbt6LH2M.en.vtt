00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.790
 for someone who does not come across Ukrainian 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.980
 Modeling obviously seems to be 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.320
 model is terribly cool prestigious 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.790
 beautiful and profitable is it today 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.470
 we talk about man models 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.990
 does inteco have to just through 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.330
 Is it really possible to make money on the shows? 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.470
 and filming Ukrainian designers as well 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.630
 what you need to do to 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.550
 stay out of competition 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.830
 we will talk about all this with arthur 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.890
 the goal is still among the male models he's one of 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.430
 most sought after in Ukraine and for 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.890
 abroad 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.879
 look listen what it is to be a model 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.860
 a man in Ukraine 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.860
 arthur damn spector do you think 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.770
 I donâ€™t know how to tell the success of hotels 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.530
 because this is a subjective opinion on 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.910
 I believe that the success of each model depends on 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.560
 her desire to work and 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.900
 need to get and agency or good 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.729
 customer good brand savenski and 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.810
 girls are modeling longer than 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.979
 Saransk and the guys 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.930
 it may be noted that her competition 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.060
 swine girls are higher than guys 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.979
 why are successful girls who 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.050
 have made a name for themselves are guys 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.010
 missing and this despite the fact that rick 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.940
 female modeling 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.440
 bark so on their masculine first turn 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.450
 I can say that we do what we 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.000
 more precisely physical names than 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.090
 guys because customers are more 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.789
 need a girl than time 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.359
 depends directly on the produced 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:36.619
 products, that is, I can say that 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:38.539
 relatively speaking on world markets 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:42.289
 some kind of asia or europe 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:45.350
 Likely to us Aleksina opinion 70 percent 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:46.939
 female products 30 male and female 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.950
 for our mage more profit in terms of 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:52.189
 model than their boyfriend because 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.859
 girls can do it seriously and 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:57.770
 the guy said more in parallel than than 

00:01:54.859 --> 00:02:01.569
 only modeling each do not build 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.409
 psyche does not omit or self-esteem 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:05.869
 nobody like it all depends on 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:09.170
 human factor personal your 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.910
 qualities I can tell from my own experience that 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.120
 gossen is good training good 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.980
 hardening for even the psyche because 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.310
 make them all the bones win it 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:22.819
 ass on this model this on casting and 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.730
 difficult to avoid here in the hands to which 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.019
 difficult to hold her in your arms because 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.940
 there are important bones are not very 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.950
 which mediocre is not always you 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.570
 flying signature don't you get 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.690
 the main task of the agency 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.060
 it is to serve as such a barrier 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.070
 or pillow for model and agency 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.810
 must understand we eat his model must 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.700
 work and where it will work and 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.140
 what customers will take and I will not 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.090
 should manage in charge of the model there 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.190
 where will indicate and possibly psyche 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.680
 or where on the street do i feel by it 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.050
 I had to decide comfortably 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.090
 questions through the bed through the bed can 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.350
 say solve questions are no longer models 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:03.150
 people are strangers or parallel or 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.300
 hugging a predictor model because 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.200
 professionally modeling bed instead 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.810
 should not be 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.390
 I think the idea is that normal go 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.780
 such things work and do not even want 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.760
 dive and delve and because 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.070
 models that must model with marina 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.790
 Name people who want to solve questions 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:26.769
 on this way they are all this and people 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.269
 also understand who to mess with 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.090
 to be a sought-after model it means 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.769
 constantly following with and appearance 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.620
 some are up to doing this 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:39.109
 spend the day spa but 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.709
 most of my friends are male models 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:43.040
 models 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.720
 spend at one time myself and does it 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.700
 every day about food too 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.790
 say that sporting unsportingly return 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.189
 healthy eating predominates in the guy 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.019
 girls and so far not yes because 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:55.549
 need more more tear your bodies 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.739
 can you tell me what is in it, and 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:00.620
 meals but personally my breakfast is worth 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.750
 always from cottage cheese and all our green 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.879
 lunch, in principle, my wife and afternoon tea 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.540
 natural intermediate meals 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:10.400
 these are healthy dates protein than filled 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.769
 your shelf with creams and other 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.019
 tubes my stick in the bathroom 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.639
 probably filled with maxim is a dental 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.560
 pasta 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:20.209
 liquid soap or shower gel that I 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.500
 got excited because the rest 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.020
 care products 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.000
 face care like 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.860
 I wish thank God when it will melt 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.479
 pension model business so that later 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.240
 someone will do next is who is 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:34.430
 how models will end for you my 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.419
 model end I think it will be soon 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.979
 depends our principle she is from me but 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:44.900
 model husband project is not just a template 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:46.789
 According to how many today it is different 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.120
 before the model happens on different in different 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:53.780
 countries we basically this 28 ceiling 32 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:56.240
 quite-of course there are up to the model in 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:59.050
 40 years, too, we give can be 70 and 80 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.009
 years is a different theorem 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:04.000
 in fact, the model may be called 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:06.380
 human regulating even means and 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.409
 drugs the same model 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:12.639
 they can be a man and 80 years old too 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:14.919
 but normal model someone 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:16.870
 insti 9 years my main job is not 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:18.999
 profession of architect and finally 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.340
 I want to talk about the fashion designer Ukraine about 

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:24.189
 these unstable creators who are nothing 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.199
 Do not spoil whether they feed model guys 

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:27.819
 or on their blood and you can stretch your legs 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:30.849
 algorithm models can honestly say 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:33.699
 Male model model of one of Rome 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:35.529
 especially not fed because the customer on 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:37.210
 actually very few models 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:39.520
 plenty and many willing to work 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.259
 even for free Ukraine because 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.740
 There are really a lot of models who want to 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:45.639
 They want to fall everywhere and light up 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.050
 respectively designers have a choice and 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:50.169
 they can count themselves 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:52.000
 how much and to whom and how to pay the problem 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:53.650
 Only in this but I can say that 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.270
 modeling Ukraine develops fame 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.550
 god and normal pace because 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.620
 There are models I with good which help 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.460
 just doing PR promotion 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.860
 models are not only here in Ukraine and me 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.539
 the police and they give you a model 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.130
 on the opportunity to earn so much 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:09.560
 how much can a model actually or 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.840
 I want to see it was a program 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.009
 I want to understand specifically for the magazine 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.539
 rolling . 

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:16.539
 I'm dishes 

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:29.030

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.030
 sex 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:34.229
 but 

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:34.229
