00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
cards all right so last week we did a

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.300

fluffy<00:00:16.170> Mexican<00:00:16.500> restaurant<00:00:16.830> style<00:00:16.980> rice

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
fluffy Mexican restaurant style rice

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.490 
fluffy Mexican restaurant style rice
with<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.760> white<00:00:18.029> rice<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:19.109> couple<00:00:19.380> people

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
with a white rice and a couple people

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.410 
with a white rice and a couple people
were<00:00:19.710> asking<00:00:20.100> about<00:00:20.250> if<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:20.609> could<00:00:20.789> use<00:00:21.029> brown

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
were asking about if you could use brown

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.960 
were asking about if you could use brown
rice<00:00:21.449> instead<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.350> honestly<00:00:23.070> I<00:00:23.189> have<00:00:23.699> not

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
rice instead and honestly I have not

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.500 
rice instead and honestly I have not
tried<00:00:24.269> that<00:00:24.539> however<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:25.859> think<00:00:26.250> that<00:00:26.820> you

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
tried that however I think that you

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.480 
tried that however I think that you
probably<00:00:27.630> could<00:00:27.960> i<00:00:28.230> would<00:00:28.890> recommend<00:00:29.310> soaking

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
probably could i would recommend soaking

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.790 
probably could i would recommend soaking
the<00:00:29.820> rice<00:00:30.359> for<00:00:30.900> more<00:00:31.109> like<00:00:31.260> 30<00:00:31.590> minutes

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
instead of 15 and then of course you'd

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.530 
instead of 15 and then of course you'd
have<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.140> increase<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.800> time<00:00:35.640> from<00:00:36.239> white

get a chance to do it i will also let
you<00:00:50.010> know<00:00:50.100> um<00:00:50.449> then<00:00:51.449> we<00:00:51.690> did<00:00:51.870> banana<00:00:52.770> pudding

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
you know um then we did banana pudding

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.590 
you know um then we did banana pudding
last<00:00:53.820> week<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:55.309> two<00:00:56.309> people<00:00:56.600> independently

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
last week and two people independently

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.470 
last week and two people independently
suggested<00:00:58.410> putting<00:00:58.859> cinnamon<00:00:59.489> on<00:00:59.699> top<00:00:59.730> of<00:01:00.120> the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
suggested putting cinnamon on top of the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.360 
suggested putting cinnamon on top of the
banana<00:01:00.660> pudding<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.800> sounds<00:01:02.100> really

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
banana pudding and that sounds really

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.650 
banana pudding and that sounds really
delicious<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.850> never<00:01:03.120> thought<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.480> before

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
delicious I never thought of that before

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.179 
delicious I never thought of that before
but<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.080> also<00:01:04.229> kind<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.500> makes<00:01:04.650> me<00:01:04.739> think<00:01:04.949> that

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
but it also kind of makes me think that

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.670 
but it also kind of makes me think that
you<00:01:05.939> could<00:01:06.060> put<00:01:06.299> like<00:01:06.540> instead<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.439> Nilla

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
you could put like instead of Nilla

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.140 
you could put like instead of Nilla
wafer<00:01:07.979> she<00:01:08.130> could<00:01:08.250> probably<00:01:08.340> use<00:01:08.580> like<00:01:08.909> graham

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
wafer she could probably use like graham

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.270 
wafer she could probably use like graham
crackers<00:01:09.570> or<00:01:09.869> ginger<00:01:10.530> snaps<00:01:10.799> or<00:01:10.979> something

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
crackers or ginger snaps or something

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.219 
crackers or ginger snaps or something
and<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.520> would<00:01:11.640> probably<00:01:11.670> be<00:01:11.939> pretty<00:01:12.720> tasty

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
and that would probably be pretty tasty

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.190 
and that would probably be pretty tasty
too<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:14.070> try<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.210> out<00:01:15.240> let<00:01:15.720> me<00:01:15.750> know<00:01:15.930> how<00:01:15.960> you

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
too so try that out let me know how you

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.780 
too so try that out let me know how you
like<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.860> then<00:01:17.820> also<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.659> got<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.979> comment

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790
