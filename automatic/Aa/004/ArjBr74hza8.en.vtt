00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.560 
is finely minced we're going to add the
kosher<00:03:16.050> salt<00:03:16.290> to<00:03:16.500> it<00:03:16.530> to<00:03:16.769> turn<00:03:16.950> into<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.190> paste

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
kosher salt to it to turn into a paste

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.360 
kosher salt to it to turn into a paste
kosher<00:03:18.570> salt<00:03:18.600> does<00:03:18.930> two<00:03:19.140> things<00:03:19.170> first<00:03:20.160> it

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
kosher salt does two things first it

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.100 
kosher salt does two things first it
helps<00:03:20.640> pull<00:03:20.790> out<00:03:20.880> all<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.090> oils<00:03:21.570> and<00:03:21.810> liquid

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
helps pull out all the oils and liquid

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.840 
helps pull out all the oils and liquid
from<00:03:22.290> it<00:03:22.470> and<00:03:22.620> it<00:03:22.860> also<00:03:22.980> acts<00:03:23.340> as<00:03:23.489> a<00:03:23.550> coarse

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
from it and it also acts as a coarse

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.820 
from it and it also acts as a coarse
surface<00:03:24.360> to<00:03:24.900> grind<00:03:25.170> the<00:03:25.260> garlic<00:03:25.590> into<00:03:25.709> the

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
surface to grind the garlic into the

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.119 
surface to grind the garlic into the
pace

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.229 

so<00:03:30.129> once<00:03:30.280> you<00:03:30.340> put<00:03:30.459> the<00:03:30.549> salt<00:03:30.760> in<00:03:30.970> you're<00:03:31.120> just

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
so once you put the salt in you're just

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:32.880 
so once you put the salt in you're just
going<00:03:31.390> to<00:03:31.450> mix<00:03:31.569> it<00:03:31.689> up<00:03:31.750> a<00:03:31.870> little<00:03:31.900> bit<00:03:32.079> with<00:03:32.769> the

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
going to mix it up a little bit with the

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.520 
going to mix it up a little bit with the
garlic<00:03:36.060> then<00:03:37.060> after<00:03:37.329> that<00:03:37.480> you're<00:03:38.319> going<00:03:38.470> to

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
garlic then after that you're going to

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.259 
garlic then after that you're going to
use<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.769> side<00:03:38.980> of<00:03:39.010> your<00:03:39.220> knife<00:03:39.370> to<00:03:39.939> grind<00:03:40.180> it

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
use the side of your knife to grind it

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:48.290 
use the side of your knife to grind it
into<00:03:40.390> a<00:03:40.450> paste

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.910 

ok<00:03:49.300> so<00:03:49.360> the<00:03:49.600> garlic's<00:03:49.960> in<00:03:50.050> a<00:03:50.140> pace<00:03:50.320> and<00:03:50.800> we're

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
ok so the garlic's in a pace and we're

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.470 
ok so the garlic's in a pace and we're
going<00:03:51.040> to<00:03:51.100> add<00:03:51.250> it<00:03:51.400> to<00:03:52.030> our<00:03:52.060> mixing<00:03:52.420> bowl<00:03:54.480> after
