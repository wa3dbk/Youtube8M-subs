at that a pen yeah and you know what he

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.609 
at that a pen yeah and you know what he
is<00:00:18.480> probably<00:00:18.900> one<00:00:19.080> of<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.230> best<00:00:19.410> at<00:00:19.590> doing

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
is probably one of the best at doing

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
he has no problem getting in from that

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.279 
he has no problem getting in from that
bar<00:00:26.849> turn<00:00:27.060> he's<00:00:27.269> got<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.480> lot<00:00:27.630> more<00:00:27.660> room<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.170> go
