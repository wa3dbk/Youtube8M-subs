huh<00:00:39.910> so<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:42.250> difference<00:00:42.670> here<00:00:42.760> in<00:00:43.059> this<00:00:43.210> in

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
huh so the difference here in this in

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.400 
huh so the difference here in this in
this<00:00:44.230> Altima<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:46.120> essentially<00:00:46.780> has<00:00:46.960> a<00:00:46.989> lot<00:00:47.379> of

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
this Altima it essentially has a lot of

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.430 
this Altima it essentially has a lot of
packages<00:00:48.040> that<00:00:48.070> were<00:00:48.310> previously<00:00:48.930> an<00:00:49.930> option

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
packages that were previously an option

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.610 
packages that were previously an option
on<00:00:50.590> the<00:00:51.250> Nissan<00:00:51.520> Altima<00:00:51.790> standard<00:00:52.360> so<00:00:52.630> it's

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
on the Nissan Altima standard so it's

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.740 
on the Nissan Altima standard so it's
essentially<00:00:54.430> what<00:00:54.550> it's<00:00:54.670> including<00:00:55.239> is<00:00:55.480> the

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
essentially what it's including is the

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.780 
essentially what it's including is the
display<00:00:56.230> audio<00:00:56.530> package<00:00:56.920> and<00:00:57.100> sport<00:00:57.430> value

display audio package and sport value

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.720 
display audio package and sport value
package<00:00:58.000> that<00:00:58.300> I<00:00:58.329> used<00:00:58.570> to<00:00:58.690> have<00:00:59.160> but<00:01:00.160> only<00:01:00.520> at

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
package that I used to have but only at

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.819 
package that I used to have but only at
a<00:01:00.760> cheaper<00:01:01.090> cost<00:01:01.120> so<00:01:01.510> definitely<00:01:02.050> it<00:01:02.620> is<00:01:02.680> a

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
a cheaper cost so definitely it is a

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.079 
a cheaper cost so definitely it is a
really<00:01:03.579> good<00:01:03.700> buy

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:09.399 
question whether it's so whether it's

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:12.480 
question whether it's so whether it's

and<00:01:51.190> this<00:01:51.459> one<00:01:51.729> is<00:01:51.910> of<00:01:52.300> course<00:01:52.330> remote<00:01:53.259> start

00:01:53.699 --> 00:01:53.709 
and this one is of course remote start

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:56.550 
and this one is of course remote start
so<00:01:54.490> we<00:01:54.670> can<00:01:54.819> turn<00:01:55.270> it<00:01:55.420> off<00:01:55.539> on<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:55.780> outside<00:01:56.319> as

well as lock it and turn it on again so

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.680 
well as lock it and turn it on again so
it's<00:01:59.920> just<00:02:00.160> one<00:02:00.459> one<00:02:00.940> thing<00:02:01.119> new<00:02:01.360> with<00:02:01.539> this

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690
