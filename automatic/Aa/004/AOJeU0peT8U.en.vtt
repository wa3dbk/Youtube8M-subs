00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:07.680
 good morning this is a video where we go 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.049
 to see a little how to set up a sleeve 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.690
 with keyboard in this case with keyboard with 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:16.340
 bluetooth connection 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:20.210
 with a 10-inch galaxy 3 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:23.960
 let's go there this case in concrete comes 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:27.230
 factory of leather material and well 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.380
 It is manufactured especially for the new 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.110
 samsung galaxy is 3 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.090
 because in particular you know because as 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.980
 you know the galaxi incorporates the camera 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.489
 front and rear camera and this sleeve now 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:42.129
 comes prepared with the holes for 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.520
 so as not to lose this benefit, it is worth 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:47.220
 You see the inside of the 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.080
 of the case that incorporates good as a 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.170
 small instruction manual where I 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.640
 will indicate how to synchronize 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.410
 sheath 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:03.650
 the keyboard and a small cable to be able 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.650
 charge the keyboard battery 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.219
 well, well, let's go there 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:15.079
 comment that the keyboard as we see the 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:17.240
 Spanish keyboard with our our 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:19.640
 letter and we do not have to make a fix 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.149
 to be recognized or anything by the 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.520
 good style to fit the tablet 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:28.800
 inside the sleeve it simply 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.900
 slide down the top 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.300
 in this way and it is with this little 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.490
 overlaps the fitting terminals to 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.230
 that did not escape, they were good 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.410
 you already see the visible connections with 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.480
 the charging connector the home button 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.730
 also the front cameras sensor 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:48.170
 shine and as we have seen before too 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.170
 the camera the back camera 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.360
 what is the next step the next 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:55.850
 step would be to synchronize 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.310
 with bluetooth® technology the keyboard 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.470
 to the tablet how are we going to do that good 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.520
 it is very simple that only the 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.710
 we will have to do the first time 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.420
 because the next times I know now 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.060
 automatically when we turn on the 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.520
 book on the one hand let's go inside 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.800
 of what is the settings menu in the 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.640
 bluetooth menu 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:19.010
 and put it enough looking for devices 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.490
 bluetooth within reach on the other hand let's 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.120
 to give the connector of pon in the cover and 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.620
 to the connect button 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.640
 I'm going to start blinking 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:35.260
 in the search that is trying 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.260
 synchronize let's go there 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.940
 let's link perfect 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.830
 I got the link request 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.959
 of bluetooth tells me that to 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.080
 synchronize with bluetooth that work I have 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.150
 than to enter a series of characters 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.700
 this case of the numerics I get 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.090
 randomly and hit the key 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.620
 return 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.620
 let's go there 92 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.490
 8 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.130
 5 and key goals 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.110
 I would have it connected perfect 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.480
 what are we going to do now let's see if 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:13.050
 it works correctly for it we go 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.650
 for example to the internet we go to the bar 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.650
 of exploration 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.730
 Y 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.650
 we write perfectly keyboards 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.090
 we have our qwerty keyboard 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.129
 perfectly 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.590
 working with our letter eñe and 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:33.050
 others and comment also good 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.640
 besides what is the keyboard this 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.310
 case also incorporates access keys 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.129
 direct to raise or lower the brightness by 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.890
 example raise or lower the volume of the 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:45.740
 multimedia keys pass for big to 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.920
 other songs even access 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:51.430
 to the microphone 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.430
 this is a little 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.870
 and the cover I hope you liked a 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.870
 greeting
