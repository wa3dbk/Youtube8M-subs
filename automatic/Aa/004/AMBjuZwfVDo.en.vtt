00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 I want to show you how we do 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:08.519
 from our gopro hero 3 or even more 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.710
 from the older group 2 our videos 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.349
 and pictures wirelessly on our iphone 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.790
 can be transferred in the basics 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.680
 why is it just a cell phone 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.080
 find like in the app store 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.910
 the easiest way to search gopro 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.880
 I have already entered this 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.960
 Here we find the app foto and 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.960
 video browser the app costs about 269 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.070
 It's worth it I already have it 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.260
 already installed if we have the app 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.860
 we still need to have one installed 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.200
 small installation on our group 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.399
 make the file we find on the 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.350
 manufacturer homepage 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.370
 I'll show you now like that 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.140
 works so after we open the app 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.579
 we have installed the iphone 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.800
 on the manufacturer's homepage 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.149
 the link can be found below in the 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.730
 description of the video 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.219
 we have to have a little here 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.049
 download file for gopro with it 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.860
 the two devices expend 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:12.510
 we go here to choose ex as well 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.369
 on the iphone motto browser here 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.290
 we find a small zip file which we 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.270
 I have to download it already 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.580
 is located in my place 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.470
 download folder if you have a windows 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.049
 then drop in there before you 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.960
 saved in this zip file 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:31.049
 there is this other file which we 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.030
 Now copy this to our gopro 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.000
 whole copying directly into the main 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.509
 We need more to do this 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.799
 do not actually do it 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.840
 after we have copied the file 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.000
 We can turn our copies all the way 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.460
 important is that on the wlan at the 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.610
 copa is on here we have to 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.140
 then do not say deneb mode for that 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.060
 normal remote control 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.460
 if we did it all 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.799
 we connect our iphone with the wlan 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.060
 from the coop pro and can already 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.829
 stop the app 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.380
 here is still very important we have to 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.680
 choose which coco we have I have 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.770
 Three black edition can now have one 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.540

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.010

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.140
