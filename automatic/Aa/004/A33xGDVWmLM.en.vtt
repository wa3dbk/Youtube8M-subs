00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.670 
living now but where I was living before
it<00:00:50.820> was<00:00:50.969> raining<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.570> lot<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.289> was<00:00:52.410> just

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
it was raining a lot and it was just

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.130 
it was raining a lot and it was just
messing<00:00:53.010> up<00:00:53.129> my<00:00:53.280> hair<00:00:53.850> like<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.239> would<00:00:54.390> start

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
messing up my hair like it would start

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.569 
messing up my hair like it would start
to<00:00:55.260> wave<00:00:55.410> back<00:00:55.440> up<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.070> thought<00:00:56.219> let<00:00:56.370> me<00:00:56.430> just

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.270 
the shower and every four days or so and
if<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:06.990> feel<00:01:07.170> like<00:01:07.229> there's<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.710> lot<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:07.920> product

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
if I feel like there's a lot of product

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.399 
if I feel like there's a lot of product
build-up<00:01:08.670> then<00:01:08.970> I'll<00:01:09.180> add<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.479> shampoo<00:01:10.140> when

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
build-up then I'll add a shampoo when

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.100 
build-up then I'll add a shampoo when
I'm<00:01:10.530> when<00:01:10.830> I'm<00:01:10.860> co<00:01:11.159> washing<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.720> kind<00:01:13.020> of

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
I'm when I'm co washing it so it kind of

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.830 
I'm when I'm co washing it so it kind of
changes<00:01:13.530> as<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.580> when<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.729> think<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.299> needs<00:01:15.330> a

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
changes as and when I think it needs a

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.649 
changes as and when I think it needs a
deep<00:01:16.439> clean<00:01:16.740> so<00:01:17.310> shedding<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.210> tangling

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
deep clean so shedding and tangling

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.399 
deep clean so shedding and tangling
shedding<00:01:19.909> its<00:01:20.909> not<00:01:21.299> like<00:01:21.479> excessive<00:01:21.990> within

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
shedding its not like excessive within

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.929 
shedding its not like excessive within
like<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.860> feels<00:01:23.159> like<00:01:23.250> things<00:01:23.490> are<00:01:23.700> crawling

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
like it feels like things are crawling

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.570 
like it feels like things are crawling
down<00:01:24.210> my<00:01:24.270> back<00:01:24.600> when<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:24.960> brush<00:01:25.200> my<00:01:25.259> hair<00:01:25.580> but

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
down my back when I brush my hair but

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.149 
down my back when I brush my hair but
it's<00:01:27.390> more<00:01:27.990> than<00:01:28.049> minimal<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:28.770> wouldn't<00:01:29.040> say

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
it's more than minimal I wouldn't say

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.440 
it's more than minimal I wouldn't say
it's<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> minimal<00:01:29.670> shedding<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.090> think<00:01:30.299> it's

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
it's a minimal shedding I think it's

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.210 
it's a minimal shedding I think it's
slightly<00:01:30.689> more<00:01:30.990> than<00:01:31.020> minimal<00:01:31.530> shedding<00:01:32.009> and

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
slightly more than minimal shedding and

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.130 
slightly more than minimal shedding and
