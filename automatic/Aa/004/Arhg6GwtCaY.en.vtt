00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
wrong at the same time so what happens

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.600 
wrong at the same time so what happens
you<00:02:12.989> can't<00:02:13.200> change<00:02:13.380> it<00:02:13.650> not<00:02:14.010> without<00:02:14.160> messing

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
you can't change it not without messing

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.770 
you can't change it not without messing
up<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.820> canvas<00:02:15.209> so<00:02:15.420> I<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:17.209> don't<00:02:18.209> do<00:02:18.330> that<00:02:18.540> again

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
up to canvas so I I don't do that again

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.800 
up to canvas so I I don't do that again
it's<00:02:19.640> understanding<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:21.000> procedure<00:02:21.450> so<00:02:21.750> you

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
it's understanding the procedure so you
