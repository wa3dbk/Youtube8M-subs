00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
think that they're so close you kind of

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.519 
think that they're so close you kind of
a<00:00:19.619> bit<00:00:19.770> more<00:00:20.330> oh<00:00:21.330> no<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:21.990> can<00:00:22.230> say<00:00:22.350> there's<00:00:22.500> a

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
a bit more oh no I can say there's a

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.519 
a bit more oh no I can say there's a
possibility<00:00:22.920> but<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.820> can't<00:00:24.060> get<00:00:24.529> distracted

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
possibility but you can't get distracted

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.599 
possibility but you can't get distracted
by<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.550> fact<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:27.000> they<00:00:27.240> are<00:00:28.160> you<00:00:29.160> know<00:00:29.279> three

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
by the fact that they are you know three

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.350 
by the fact that they are you know three
games<00:00:29.849> now<00:00:30.260> from<00:00:31.260> Oz<00:00:31.410> instead<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.250> seven<00:00:32.880> as

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
games now from Oz instead of seven as

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.920 
games now from Oz instead of seven as
they<00:00:33.570> were<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:34.050> week<00:00:34.440> ago<00:00:34.910> so<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.690> know<00:00:36.780> they

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
they were a week ago so you know they

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.240 
they were a week ago so you know they
did<00:00:37.140> I'm<00:00:37.469> sure<00:00:37.649> they<00:00:37.860> want<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.100> keep<00:00:38.190> that

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
did I'm sure they want to keep that

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.240 
did I'm sure they want to keep that
number<00:00:38.520> one<00:00:38.820> spot<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.690> they'll<00:00:40.559> do<00:00:40.770> what<00:00:41.219> they

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
number one spot and they'll do what they

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.639 
number one spot and they'll do what they
have<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.520> do<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:41.760> guess<00:00:42.230> and<00:00:43.230> they<00:00:43.320> have<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.469> tough

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
have to do I guess and they have a tough

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.619 
have to do I guess and they have a tough
schedule<00:00:43.770> we<00:00:44.100> have<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.250> tough<00:00:44.430> schedule<00:00:44.629> we

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
schedule we have a tough schedule we

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.170 
schedule we have a tough schedule we
have<00:00:45.660> nine<00:00:45.930> games<00:00:46.170> i<00:00:46.379> think<00:00:46.559> in<00:00:46.649> 14<00:00:47.160> days<00:00:47.280> which

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
have nine games i think in 14 days which

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.380 
have nine games i think in 14 days which
won't<00:00:48.390> be<00:00:48.450> easy<00:00:48.780> at<00:00:49.350> all<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:50.239> couple<00:00:51.239> tough

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
won't be easy at all and couple tough

00:00:51.390 --> 00:01:00.350 
won't be easy at all and couple tough
ones<00:00:51.600> but<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:52.079> know<00:00:52.230> we<00:00:52.320> look<00:00:52.469> forward<00:00:52.680> to

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:08.580 

well<00:01:05.490> yeah<00:01:06.490> it<00:01:06.730> probably<00:01:06.880> forces<00:01:07.330> to<00:01:07.480> to<00:01:07.960> focus

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
well yeah it probably forces to to focus

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.570 
well yeah it probably forces to to focus
and<00:01:09.070> tune<00:01:09.760> in<00:01:09.940> and<00:01:10.230> and<00:01:11.230> bring<00:01:12.010> everything<00:01:12.250> we

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
and tune in and and bring everything we

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.280 
and tune in and and bring everything we
got<00:01:12.730> to<00:01:13.600> the<00:01:13.930> game<00:01:14.080> so<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.790> yeah<00:01:16.180> it<00:01:16.450> doesn't<00:01:16.840> it

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
got to the game so so yeah it doesn't it

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:18.750 
got to the game so so yeah it doesn't it
doesn't<00:01:17.320> allow<00:01:17.680> us<00:01:17.800> to<00:01:17.950> relax<00:01:18.220> and<00:01:18.460> too

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.760 
doesn't allow us to relax and too

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.480 
doesn't allow us to relax and too
comfortable<00:01:19.210> because<00:01:19.360> we<00:01:20.110> know<00:01:20.290> how<00:01:20.500> hard<00:01:20.770> the

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
comfortable because we know how hard the

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.070 
comfortable because we know how hard the
opponents<00:01:21.970> are<00:01:22.060> we<00:01:22.330> know<00:01:22.510> that<00:01:22.750> it's<00:01:22.870> getting

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
opponents are we know that it's getting

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.020 
opponents are we know that it's getting
closer<00:01:23.260> to<00:01:23.380> the<00:01:23.530> end<00:01:23.680> so<00:01:24.460> everything<00:01:24.880> is<00:01:25.000> a

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
closer to the end so everything is a

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.380 
closer to the end so everything is a
little<00:01:25.630> bit<00:01:25.780> of<00:01:25.900> magnified<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:28.060> know<00:01:28.210> it's

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
little bit of magnified you know it's

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.720 
little bit of magnified you know it's
just<00:01:28.480> the<00:01:28.690> way<00:01:28.840> it<00:01:28.990> goes<00:01:29.020> and<00:01:29.200> we<00:01:29.530> we<00:01:30.310> kind<00:01:30.610> of

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.730 
just the way it goes and we we kind of

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.120 
just the way it goes and we we kind of
always<00:01:31.020> stayed<00:01:32.020> to<00:01:32.229> ourselves<00:01:32.350> and<00:01:32.830> stayed<00:01:32.979> in

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
always stayed to ourselves and stayed in

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.090 
always stayed to ourselves and stayed in
our<00:01:33.250> lane<00:01:33.460> and<00:01:33.670> kept<00:01:33.790> ourselves<00:01:35.100> confident

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
our lane and kept ourselves confident

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.120 
our lane and kept ourselves confident
and<00:01:36.660> we<00:01:37.660> understand<00:01:38.110> how<00:01:38.260> the<00:01:38.320> season<00:01:38.560> goes<00:01:38.890> it

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
and we understand how the season goes it

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.770 
and we understand how the season goes it
goes<00:01:39.250> up<00:01:39.460> and<00:01:39.640> down<00:01:39.729> like<00:01:40.090> as<00:01:40.300> valleys<00:01:40.660> and

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
goes up and down like as valleys and

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.109 
goes up and down like as valleys and
peaks<00:01:40.960> during<00:01:41.050> the<00:01:41.260> season<00:01:41.590> and<00:01:41.740> we<00:01:41.830> always

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
peaks during the season and we always

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.750 
peaks during the season and we always
kind<00:01:43.119> of<00:01:43.270> you<00:01:43.570> know<00:01:43.830> kept<00:01:44.830> our<00:01:45.040> heads<00:01:45.070> straight

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
kind of you know kept our heads straight

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.270 
kind of you know kept our heads straight
and<00:01:46.090> on<00:01:46.330> the<00:01:46.600> right<00:01:46.780> way<00:01:46.960> and<00:01:46.990> I<00:01:47.380> think<00:01:48.190> we

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
and on the right way and I think we

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.010 
and on the right way and I think we
realize<00:01:48.670> as<00:01:48.880> a<00:01:48.910> team<00:01:49.240> that<00:01:49.510> you<00:01:49.660> know<00:01:49.780> it's<00:01:49.960> a

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
realize as a team that you know it's a

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.980 
realize as a team that you know it's a
long<00:01:50.260> long<00:01:50.740> long<00:01:51.130> season<00:01:51.670> and<00:01:51.820> you<00:01:52.720> know<00:01:52.810> here

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
long long long season and you know here

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.540 
long long long season and you know here
we<00:01:53.110> are<00:01:53.140> an<00:01:53.440> opportunity<00:01:53.950> to<00:01:54.070> catch<00:01:54.250> them<00:01:54.430> and

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
we are an opportunity to catch them and

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.820 
we are an opportunity to catch them and
it's<00:01:55.060> fun<00:01:55.240> you<00:01:55.660> know<00:01:55.720> I<00:01:55.780> think<00:01:55.930> it<00:01:56.229> adds<00:01:56.440> to<00:01:56.710> the
