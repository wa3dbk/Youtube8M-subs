00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 Hello everyone and welcome back this new one 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.960
 video I'm federica and today i'll talk to you 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.179
 of the books I still have and 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.240
 which I still have to read I discovered that 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.670
 there is this sort of list mode 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.070
 of books to read on youtube 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.859
 I wanted to make you gods too 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.529
 mine, however, because there are so many 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.689
 I believe it will be a sort of rubric 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.029
 there are more than a hundred books I have 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.320
 at home they have yet to read as 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.170
 I want this video to be really 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.540
 short unlike previous within 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.149
 the 10 minutes possibly I believe that 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.700
 milita I'll just take it 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.450
 only a very small part in the 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.290
 spinels 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.820
 specifically they are 13 what then 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.620
 let's first start with the books that 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.710
 I have on the bedside table because I still have to 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.539
 read the problem with the books that I 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.550
 i'm reading and i know when i start 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.469
 I don't know when I finish them because of 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.660
 as the miserable the ict lugo I'm 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.719
 reading for two and a half years 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.399
 now I miss the last 300 pages e 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.210
 I hope to finish it at least this year 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.490
 primates of the age of three years 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.140
 yes they are not a problem these days 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.820
 with particularly long books 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:18.689
 because it is as if I need to 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.780
 read things short things to end up in 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.630
 I don't know about long books 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.610
 distract the same reason why not 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.090
 I still finished the throne of swords of 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.710
 martin 1 because precisely it is long and I do not 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.720
 I have this mental predisposition to the 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.280
 moment two because I'm finding it 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.020
 boring having already seen the TV series 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.060
 not 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.590
 I don't think martina is that guy 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.149
 of a writer who clings to it 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.100
 style as a result we already know the 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.350
 events can begin to become 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.450
 boring other book I have on the bedside table 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.799
 that I'm reading but this is it 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.289
 justified 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.659
 the joyce ulisse that I started from 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:57.950
 a month but I'm already there yet 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.390
 page one hundred 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.209
 also because I 'm alternating it with 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.780
 guide to reading and in short a book 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:07.549
 quite challenging I realized that 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.190
 you don't even have to do it 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:13.040
 effort to follow the logical thread 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.680
 because it is useless it reads as well as 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.910
 it is seen that the guide obviously does not 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.140
 explains everything in detail 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:23.989
 I'm also reading steinbeck's fury 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:27.470
 this I arrived on page 150 e 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:32.000
 this is beautiful but even here I have one 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:33.440
 sort of slowing down this though 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.260
 I believe I will finish it within the month 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.980
 absolutely in the bedside table besides everyone 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:43.970
 these books that I go out reading or even and 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.480
 nicola lagioia's ferocity 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:51.579
 here it is that I bought bought 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.579
 one of the arms of Milan in November 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.630
 and I believe that I will read it too 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.900
 as soon as possible because it is a book that a 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.670
 part 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.310
 which is very controversial, some say 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.870
 which is ugly and written but the others in 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.060
 genoa brain as a masterpiece and between 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.709
 the five finalist of the witch prize 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.180
 this year's second is strongly 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.579
 convinced that I won him 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.939
 or the light iron winner wins 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:16.980
 both in the end I also have darkness 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:19.829
 over the hedge over the harper hedge 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.780
 lee I found that I had to read from 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.400
 a lot of the time I found it alcohol 40 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.870
 percent discount to feltrinelli not 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.239
 I know how it is possible given that in 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.909
 theory exists the levi law that puts a 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:33.389
 maximum limit of discounts, however 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:35.970
 instead of 12 euros and I took it precisely 7 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:39.030
 nothing is a beautiful edition it seemed to me 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:42.750
 a pity to leave it other books 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.389
 that I have stories to read on the bedside table 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.799
 weird sorensen 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:49.560
 this book was honored by me 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.709
 old man's publishing house at a marina 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.109
 of books that the publishing fair 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:57.540
 independent of Palermo and we already had 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:59.879
 received some of their books have me 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:03.299
 wanted to give this for the blog I have it 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:05.970
 I actually chose a pink plot 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:08.489
 in short, of eligible candidates and I chose it 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.530
 because these are dystopian tales 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:14.040
 registered in the same period of 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.449
 fahrenheit 451 1984 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.940
 it seemed to me another point of view 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:20.400
 Also interesting is why I 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.490
 discovered he is a Danish writer himself 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.550
 much used for culture has been 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.830
 contributing magazine director 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:32.130
 cultural as well as being a writer 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:35.010
 so I'm glad to meet him later 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.090
 read or you should know that me 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:40.889
 practically every time it is a 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:43.710
 birthdays I receive avalanches of books e 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:45.900
 fortunately and good 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.389
 feltrinelli here good that I spend 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.420
 very happily because my plus 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.090
 great dream 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.320
 a point store in a bookstore 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.400
 fill the basket with books that later 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.110
 I won't pay 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.420
 this is something that gives me great 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.920
 satisfaction even if last 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:02.530
 birthday I happened to receive 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.920
 I believe only one book is a flight of 20 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.460
 EUR 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:09.820
 patience is short, so I have 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.630
 still residues of book coupons 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.140
 two years ago 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:16.540
 some of these are the museum 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:19.870
 of the innocence of pamuk that as you know 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:24.310
 a Turkish writer Don's white noise 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:25.990
 delillo and roth's american pastoral 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.580
 these are such writers 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.140
 important that the men play every 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.880
 time I have to read them and accordingly 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.860
 I still haven't read them but sooner or later 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.870
 I believe that by this year I hope to 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.410
 read at least routes that obviously 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:40.870
 deserves routes or even our gang 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:45.490
 which was given to me at full strength 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:47.560
 last year and which I think is one 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:50.050
 for a much lesser work at least 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.870
 let's make a comparison 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:55.870
 then I also bought at the 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.760
 last year's book and I should also 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.140
 do the next episode maybe they will be 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.300
 on those for example with completeness 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:03.970
 one of turin's book last year e 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:06.670
 that I have not yet read the sun or the 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:10.300
 franzen corrections and this too 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:13.330
 quite long heavy and challenging 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.310
 then I inserted in this list we see 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.080
 if I'm forgetting someone, I don't 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.130
 included in this list for the moment 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:23.680
 also a god of illusions of a tart woman 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:26.230
 I bought after reading too 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.390
 give me this birthday last year 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:31.630
 the goldfinch I liked 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:32.980
 discreetly but wanted to read 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.990
 something pro of the home page 

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.810
 and since this is set in a 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.950
 college 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:42.630
 I particularly love these issues 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.550
 high school teen stories 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:46.230
 training set in schools a little 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.419
 as the fleeting moment is a bit like 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:51.660
 the last book of aids a good school 

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:52.620
 which I have always bought at the marina 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.780
 of books 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.610
 the palermo is finished because if i have them 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:59.100
 bought only one thing and that was it 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:02.460
 the perfect mental illness of aids 

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:04.139
 ok the video will have seven minutes I hope that 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.919
 this and you can really follow it 

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:10.910
 all the next episode 

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:10.910
 it's a hello greeting
