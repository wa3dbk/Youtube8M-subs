it's it's some live are made and like I
just<00:03:17.160> lot<00:03:17.400> like<00:03:17.550> the<00:03:17.670> trigger<00:03:18.000> would<00:03:18.540> have

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
just lot like the trigger would have

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.229 
just lot like the trigger would have
been<00:03:18.900> having<00:03:19.800> some<00:03:19.980> moving<00:03:20.310> parts<00:03:20.760> or<00:03:20.940> likely

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
been having some moving parts or likely

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.550 
been having some moving parts or likely
we<00:03:21.360> zeppa<00:03:21.600> that<00:03:21.810> would<00:03:21.900> have<00:03:21.989> pushed<00:03:22.200> a<00:03:22.380> button

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
we zeppa that would have pushed a button

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.350 
we zeppa that would have pushed a button
but<00:03:23.340> having<00:03:23.580> a<00:03:23.640> look<00:03:23.790> at<00:03:23.910> it<00:03:24.030> it<00:03:24.150> doesn't

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
but having a look at it it doesn't

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.850 
but having a look at it it doesn't
actually<00:03:24.720> it<00:03:25.080> seems<00:03:25.260> like<00:03:25.530> pushing<00:03:25.830> the

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
actually it seems like pushing the

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.400 
actually it seems like pushing the
button<00:03:26.160> communities<00:03:27.050> somewhere<00:03:28.050> in<00:03:28.200> there

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
button communities somewhere in there

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.680 
button communities somewhere in there
into<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.010> bottom<00:03:29.160> of<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.459> remote<00:03:29.730> so<00:03:29.970> I<00:03:30.150> had

into the bottom of the remote so I had

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.140 
into the bottom of the remote so I had
no<00:03:30.810> idea<00:03:30.840> about<00:03:31.110> technology<00:03:31.860> but<00:03:31.890> um<00:03:32.310> I<00:03:32.820> think

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
no idea about technology but um I think

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.770 
no idea about technology but um I think
a<00:03:33.180> little<00:03:33.390> bit<00:03:33.570> more<00:03:33.750> to<00:03:33.810> it<00:03:34.080> than<00:03:34.200> i<00:03:34.260> thought

the<00:05:44.800> black<00:05:45.010> America<00:05:45.580> one<00:05:45.760> I<00:05:45.940> decide<00:05:46.180> do<00:05:46.330> with

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
the black America one I decide do with

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.420 
the black America one I decide do with
American<00:05:46.960> systems<00:05:47.380> just<00:05:47.680> because<00:05:48.250> of<00:05:48.400> the

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
American systems just because of the

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.640 
American systems just because of the
region<00:05:48.850> looking<00:05:49.030> and<00:05:49.450> never<00:05:50.230> thing<00:05:50.440> like<00:05:50.620> that

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
region looking and never thing like that

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.980 
region looking and never thing like that

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
but it's just easier to give up my games

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:58.280 
but it's just easier to give up my games
from<00:05:53.770> the<00:05:53.920> US<00:05:54.190> so<00:05:55.030> good<00:05:55.210> the<00:05:55.300> 3ds<00:05:55.690> as<00:05:55.960> well

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:04.450 
that's just got a case in there actually

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:05.610 
that's just got a case in there actually
got<00:06:04.570> one<00:06:04.690> of<00:06:04.780> the<00:06:04.840> systems<00:06:05.230> it<00:06:05.350> has<00:06:05.440> like<00:06:05.590> a

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
got one of the systems it has like a

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.580 
got one of the systems it has like a
wobbly<00:06:06.250> top<00:06:07.000> like<00:06:07.300> it<00:06:07.990> doesn't<00:06:08.200> really<00:06:08.320> get<00:06:08.470> in

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590 
wobbly top like it doesn't really get in

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 
little thing on the inside there to stop

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.730 
little thing on the inside there to stop
it<00:06:15.430> from<00:06:15.670> sort<00:06:15.940> of<00:06:16.030> the<00:06:16.450> screen<00:06:16.810> rubs<00:06:17.410> against
