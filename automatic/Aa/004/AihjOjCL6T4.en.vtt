to this the formerly costly imported
nanopowder<00:02:32.150> is<00:02:32.390> now<00:02:32.540> purchasable<00:02:33.140> at<00:02:33.230> a<00:02:33.500> lower

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
nanopowder is now purchasable at a lower

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.680 
nanopowder is now purchasable at a lower
price<00:02:33.769> this<00:02:34.730> contributes<00:02:35.180> to<00:02:35.599> the

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
price this contributes to the

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.670 
price this contributes to the
development<00:02:35.720> of<00:02:36.200> nano<00:02:36.410> industries<00:02:36.950> as<00:02:37.099> well

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
development of nano industries as well

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.710 
development of nano industries as well
we<00:02:39.680> hope<00:02:39.920> to<00:02:39.950> soon<00:02:40.370> see<00:02:40.720> nanotechnology

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
we hope to soon see nanotechnology

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.869 
we hope to soon see nanotechnology
