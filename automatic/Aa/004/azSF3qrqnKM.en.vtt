rivet on but I really did pretty good

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.830 
rivet on but I really did pretty good
and<00:02:19.420> then<00:02:19.510> we<00:02:19.600> put<00:02:19.840> a<00:02:19.870> two<00:02:20.620> inch<00:02:20.800> PVC<00:02:21.569> pipe<00:02:22.569> in

and then we put a two inch PVC pipe in

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.900 
and then we put a two inch PVC pipe in
that<00:02:22.990> was<00:02:23.110> made<00:02:23.290> for<00:02:23.530> variable<00:02:24.010> we<00:02:24.550> ran<00:02:24.730> the

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
that was made for variable we ran the

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.300 
that was made for variable we ran the
water<00:02:25.030> light<00:02:25.360> inside<00:02:25.720> of<00:02:25.870> that<00:02:26.250> getting<00:02:27.250> the

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
water light inside of that getting the

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.100 
water light inside of that getting the
pulp<00:02:27.550> strand<00:02:27.880> power<00:02:28.090> line<00:02:28.390> inside<00:02:28.810> of<00:02:28.900> that

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
pulp strand power line inside of that

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.850 
pulp strand power line inside of that
and<00:02:29.770> of<00:02:29.860> course<00:02:29.920> we<00:02:30.100> put<00:02:30.400> it<00:02:30.520> all<00:02:30.640> together<00:02:30.760> so

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
and of course we put it all together so

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.210 
and of course we put it all together so
filters<00:02:32.860> and<00:02:33.010> stuff<00:02:33.100> out<00:02:33.400> of<00:02:33.430> it<00:02:34.890> this<00:02:35.890> is<00:02:35.950> what

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
the trench looks like with the pipe in

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.750 
the trench looks like with the pipe in
it<00:02:37.840> see<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.709> two<00:02:38.860> different<00:02:39.160> layers<00:02:39.310> in<00:02:39.670> the

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
it see the two different layers in the

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.340 
it see the two different layers in the
hardpack<00:02:40.000> layer<00:02:40.510> and<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:40.840> layer<00:02:40.870> below<00:02:41.230> it

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
hardpack layer and the layer below it

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.809 
hardpack layer and the layer below it
which<00:02:41.530> is<00:02:41.680> play<00:02:41.950> layer<00:02:42.190> and<00:02:42.430> then<00:02:42.520> of<00:02:42.610> course

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
which is play layer and then of course

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.170 
which is play layer and then of course
the<00:02:42.940> gravel<00:02:43.270> layer<00:02:43.300> on<00:02:43.630> top<00:02:45.030> turned<00:02:46.030> out

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
the gravel layer on top turned out

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.900 
the gravel layer on top turned out
pretty<00:02:46.330> good<00:02:46.660> this<00:02:47.500> is<00:02:47.680> probably<00:02:48.220> a<00:02:48.430> day<00:02:48.670> and<00:02:48.850> a

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.470 

it's<00:03:12.770> actually<00:03:13.130> a<00:03:13.190> pretty<00:03:13.610> noisy<00:03:13.850> machine

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
it's actually a pretty noisy machine

up the lawn a little bit I think it's a

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.020 
up the lawn a little bit I think it's a
little<00:03:33.770> worst<00:03:34.040> job<00:03:34.340> on<00:03:34.520> our<00:03:34.640> lawn<00:03:34.850> just

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
little worst job on our lawn just

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.460 
little worst job on our lawn just
because<00:03:35.240> it<00:03:35.390> has<00:03:35.510> a<00:03:35.540> little<00:03:35.660> more<00:03:35.900> play<00:03:36.200> in<00:03:36.230> it

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
because it has a little more play in it

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.110 
because it has a little more play in it
pretty<00:03:36.950> hard<00:03:37.130> and<00:03:37.340> dry<00:03:37.550> this<00:03:37.610> time<00:03:37.880> of<00:03:38.240> year

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
pretty hard and dry this time of year

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.880 
pretty hard and dry this time of year
I'm<00:03:41.120> sure<00:03:41.270> glad<00:03:41.660> we<00:03:41.780> had<00:03:42.080> this<00:03:42.230> machine<00:03:42.620> that's

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
I'm sure glad we had this machine that's

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.450 
I'm sure glad we had this machine that's
for<00:03:43.040> sure<00:03:43.190> made<00:03:43.550> like<00:03:43.730> a<00:03:43.940> lot<00:03:44.360> a<00:03:44.630> lot<00:03:45.380> simpler<00:03:46.100> I

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.460 
for sure made like a lot a lot simpler I

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.280 
for sure made like a lot a lot simpler I
certainly<00:03:47.300> wouldn't<00:03:47.600> want<00:03:47.780> to<00:03:47.840> trench<00:03:48.110> all

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
certainly wouldn't want to trench all

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:59.809 
certainly wouldn't want to trench all
these<00:03:48.500> lines

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.300 

I'm<00:04:00.629> not<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:00.989> fastest<00:04:01.379> set<00:04:01.590> operating<00:04:02.189> this

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
I'm not the fastest set operating this

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.770 
I'm not the fastest set operating this
stuff<00:04:02.579> but<00:04:02.939> it<00:04:03.810> went<00:04:03.989> pretty<00:04:04.200> smooth<00:04:04.560> and<00:04:05.780> then

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
stuff but it went pretty smooth and then

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.089 
stuff but it went pretty smooth and then
there<00:04:06.900> you<00:04:06.989> can<00:04:07.109> see<00:04:07.230> the<00:04:07.349> valves<00:04:07.709> there<00:04:07.920> we'll

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
there you can see the valves there we'll

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.959 
there you can see the valves there we'll
go<00:04:08.219> into<00:04:08.459> that<00:04:08.579> line<00:04:10.219> we<00:04:11.219> attached<00:04:11.519> all<00:04:11.790> the

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:11.969 
go into that line we attached all the

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:15.770 
go into that line we attached all the
valves<00:04:12.319> and<00:04:13.319> the<00:04:13.530> lines<00:04:13.739> with<00:04:14.480> little<00:04:15.480> metal

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
valves and the lines with little metal

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.379 
valves and the lines with little metal
ring<00:04:16.380> clamps<00:04:16.769> that<00:04:16.889> crimp<00:04:17.220> shut<00:04:17.459> and<00:04:17.940> we

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
ring clamps that crimp shut and we

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:19.879 
ring clamps that crimp shut and we
checked<00:04:18.630> them<00:04:18.780> all<00:04:18.900> for<00:04:19.139> leaks<00:04:19.320> here<00:04:19.590> before

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
checked them all for leaks here before

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.009 
checked them all for leaks here before
we<00:04:19.979> bury<00:04:20.250> them<00:04:20.430> in<00:04:20.549> as<00:04:20.789> you<00:04:21.359> can<00:04:21.479> see<00:04:21.750> there's

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
we bury them in as you can see there's

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.860 
we bury them in as you can see there's
tracks<00:04:22.830> and<00:04:23.160> trails<00:04:23.490> all<00:04:23.820> over<00:04:23.880> the<00:04:24.690> lawn

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
tracks and trails all over the lawn

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.080 
tracks and trails all over the lawn
after<00:04:25.169> about<00:04:25.440> a<00:04:25.500> half<00:04:25.740> day<00:04:26.009> of<00:04:26.190> ditching<00:04:26.970> this

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
after about a half day of ditching this

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.810 
after about a half day of ditching this
thing<00:04:27.889> you<00:04:28.889> know<00:04:29.009> these<00:04:29.190> little<00:04:29.400> blue<00:04:29.520> pipes

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
thing you know these little blue pipes

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.430 
thing you know these little blue pipes
are<00:04:30.060> sticking<00:04:30.389> up<00:04:30.509> pretty<00:04:30.900> much<00:04:30.990> everywhere

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
are sticking up pretty much everywhere

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.920 
are sticking up pretty much everywhere
we<00:04:31.620> want<00:04:31.860> them<00:04:32.009> this<00:04:32.729> is<00:04:32.880> our<00:04:33.060> main<00:04:33.270> in<00:04:33.599> from

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
we want them this is our main in from

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.879 
we want them this is our main in from
the<00:04:34.050> house<00:04:34.199> so<00:04:35.099> basically<00:04:36.000> we<00:04:36.240> have<00:04:36.479> a<00:04:36.889> pump

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
the house so basically we have a pump

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.230 
the house so basically we have a pump
well<00:04:38.360> we're<00:04:39.360> doing<00:04:39.630> about<00:04:40.009> 32<00:04:41.009> gallon<00:04:41.520> pump<00:04:41.970> on

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
well we're doing about 32 gallon pump on

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.129 
well we're doing about 32 gallon pump on
it<00:04:42.449> and<00:04:43.400> because<00:04:44.400> it's<00:04:44.580> down<00:04:44.759> about<00:04:45.120> 200<00:04:45.990> feet

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
it and because it's down about 200 feet

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:50.060 
it and because it's down about 200 feet
it's<00:04:46.349> putting<00:04:46.560> out<00:04:46.680> about<00:04:46.800> 16<00:04:47.340> gallons<00:04:49.009> as<00:04:50.009> a

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
it's putting out about 16 gallons as a

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.189 
it's putting out about 16 gallons as a
rate<00:04:50.400> and<00:04:50.669> then<00:04:51.210> basically<00:04:51.630> what<00:04:51.900> we<00:04:52.020> did<00:04:52.139> is

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 
rate and then basically what we did is

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:54.260 
rate and then basically what we did is
we<00:04:52.500> put<00:04:52.530> a<00:04:52.740> pressure<00:04:53.160> check<00:04:53.490> valve<00:04:53.729> in<00:04:53.970> it<00:04:54.090> and

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
we put a pressure check valve in it and

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.230 
we put a pressure check valve in it and
then<00:04:54.990> from<00:04:55.289> there<00:04:55.789> you<00:04:56.789> know<00:04:56.910> we<00:04:57.060> had<00:04:57.210> it

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
then from there you know we had it

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.909 
then from there you know we had it
plumbed<00:04:57.630> in<00:04:57.780> by<00:04:57.930> our<00:04:58.080> plumber<00:04:58.410> to<00:04:58.620> make<00:04:58.770> sure

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
plumbed in by our plumber to make sure

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.310 
plumbed in by our plumber to make sure
that<00:04:59.160> that<00:04:59.310> was<00:04:59.520> up<00:04:59.699> to<00:04:59.820> code<00:04:59.849> and<00:05:00.330> inspected

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
that that was up to code and inspected

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.249 
that that was up to code and inspected
and<00:05:01.530> then<00:05:02.009> we<00:05:02.130> hooked<00:05:02.310> our<00:05:02.460> mainline<00:05:02.639> to<00:05:03.060> it

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:03.259 
and then we hooked our mainline to it

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:05.330 
and then we hooked our mainline to it
pretty<00:05:04.259> much<00:05:04.409> then<00:05:04.620> it<00:05:04.710> was<00:05:04.800> just<00:05:04.919> adding

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
pretty much then it was just adding

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.930 
pretty much then it was just adding
these<00:05:05.460> heads

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
these heads

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.490 
these heads
I<00:05:06.060> thought<00:05:06.509> these<00:05:06.690> heads<00:05:06.960> would<00:05:07.050> be<00:05:07.110> harder<00:05:07.470> to

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
I thought these heads would be harder to

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.409 
I thought these heads would be harder to
add<00:05:07.740> they<00:05:07.949> really<00:05:08.220> weren't<00:05:08.400> a<00:05:08.699> little<00:05:09.120> bit<00:05:09.330> of

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
add they really weren't a little bit of

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:11.300 
add they really weren't a little bit of
funny<00:05:09.630> pipe<00:05:09.930> and<00:05:10.229> a<00:05:10.409> little<00:05:10.740> bit<00:05:10.830> of<00:05:10.919> threading

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
funny pipe and a little bit of threading

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.810 
funny pipe and a little bit of threading
they<00:05:12.120> all<00:05:12.240> went<00:05:12.479> in<00:05:12.979> then<00:05:13.979> I<00:05:14.009> was<00:05:14.159> just<00:05:14.310> bury

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
they all went in then I was just bury

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.249 
they all went in then I was just bury
them<00:05:14.970> into<00:05:15.210> the<00:05:15.330> ground<00:05:15.479> a<00:05:15.690> little<00:05:15.780> bit<00:05:15.930> and

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:16.259 
them into the ground a little bit and

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:18.850 
them into the ground a little bit and
turn<00:05:16.919> the<00:05:17.039> water<00:05:17.220> on<00:05:17.370> and<00:05:17.729> then<00:05:17.970> boom

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
turn the water on and then boom

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.899 
turn the water on and then boom
sprinklers<00:05:19.860> are<00:05:20.009> up<00:05:20.130> and<00:05:20.280> running<00:05:20.430> and<00:05:20.789> of

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:20.909 
sprinklers are up and running and of

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:22.520 
sprinklers are up and running and of
course<00:05:21.120> with<00:05:21.300> hunters<00:05:21.690> there's<00:05:22.139> quite<00:05:22.409> a<00:05:22.440> few

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
course with hunters there's quite a few

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.620 
course with hunters there's quite a few
adjustment<00:05:23.190> abilities<00:05:23.580> in<00:05:23.849> just<00:05:24.180> the<00:05:24.300> spray

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
adjustment abilities in just the spray

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.450 
adjustment abilities in just the spray
in<00:05:24.960> just<00:05:25.199> the<00:05:25.289> distance<00:05:25.680> you<00:05:25.889> can<00:05:26.039> just<00:05:26.250> the

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
in just the distance you can just the

left or the right rotation from anything

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.890 
left or the right rotation from anything
from<00:05:29.130> you<00:05:29.370> know<00:05:29.400> 10<00:05:29.759> degrees<00:05:30.090> all<00:05:30.659> the<00:05:30.690> way<00:05:30.840> to

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
from you know 10 degrees all the way to
