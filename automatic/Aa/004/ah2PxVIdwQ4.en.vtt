00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
I had two wires before i got this

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.530 
I had two wires before i got this
thicker<00:01:52.320> wire<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.939> two<00:01:54.090> wires<00:01:54.270> i<00:01:54.420> had

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
thicker wire and and the two wires i had

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.630 
thicker wire and and the two wires i had
before<00:01:54.930> were<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.259> lot<00:01:55.710> thinner<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.369> was<00:01:56.520> just

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
before were a lot thinner it was just

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.760 
before were a lot thinner it was just
building<00:01:56.909> me<00:01:57.210> up<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:58.229> get<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.560> thicker

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
building me up to get to the thicker

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.209 
building me up to get to the thicker
wires<00:01:59.070> my<00:01:59.549> orthodontist<00:02:00.240> told<00:02:00.479> me<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:01.259> in<00:02:01.710> 16

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
wires my orthodontist told me that in 16

wires my orthodontist told me that in 16
weeks<00:02:02.250> which<00:02:02.909> i<00:02:03.000> think<00:02:03.060> is<00:02:03.270> about<00:02:03.509> four<00:02:03.810> months

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
weeks which i think is about four months

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.930 
weeks which i think is about four months
i<00:02:04.350> can<00:02:04.860> start<00:02:05.070> looking<00:02:05.250> in

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
i can start looking in

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.420 
i can start looking in
to<00:02:06.080> thinking<00:02:07.080> about<00:02:07.230> getting<00:02:07.380> surgery<00:02:07.830> I'm

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:08.430

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.930 
pretty sure that he said that i'll have
to<00:02:10.260> double<00:02:10.380> check<00:02:10.560> on<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:10.920> he<00:02:11.670> said<00:02:11.850> my

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
to double check on that he said my

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
tendency to push it out and then it goes

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.140 
tendency to push it out and then it goes
back<00:02:39.480> in<00:02:39.960> because<00:02:40.230> wires<00:02:40.530> pulling<00:02:41.040> it<00:02:41.160> back<00:02:41.370> so

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
back in because wires pulling it back so

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.990 
back in because wires pulling it back so
