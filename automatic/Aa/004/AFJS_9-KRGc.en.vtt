completely forgotten about that and then

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.910 
completely forgotten about that and then
I<00:06:27.730> realized<00:06:28.180> that<00:06:28.360> pre-op<00:06:29.050> he<00:06:29.320> had<00:06:29.410> said<00:06:29.680> I

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:29.920

and<00:06:32.890> I<00:06:33.640> thought<00:06:34.200> 185<00:06:35.200> but<00:06:36.180> now<00:06:37.180> I<00:06:37.210> look<00:06:37.510> at<00:06:37.600> it<00:06:37.750> I

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:37.870 
and I thought 185 but now I look at it I

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.420
