those have mostly been solved now and

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.429 
those have mostly been solved now and
it's<00:02:24.549> about<00:02:24.670> near<00:02:25.389> ninety<00:02:25.900> percent<00:02:26.019> better

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:26.439 
it's about near ninety percent better

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:28.559 
it's about near ninety percent better
than<00:02:26.680> it<00:02:26.799> was<00:02:26.829> before<00:02:27.090> there's<00:02:28.090> still<00:02:28.299> the<00:02:28.450> odd

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
than it was before there's still the odd

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.209 
than it was before there's still the odd
issue<00:02:28.719> with<00:02:28.989> animals<00:02:29.409> running<00:02:29.739> at<00:02:29.920> you<00:02:30.069> like

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:30.219 
issue with animals running at you like

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:31.770 
issue with animals running at you like
they're<00:02:30.370> going<00:02:30.519> to<00:02:30.639> attack<00:02:30.790> then<00:02:31.269> freezing

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
they're going to attack then freezing

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.039 
they're going to attack then freezing
and<00:02:31.959> not<00:02:32.319> doing<00:02:32.530> anything<00:02:32.709> more<00:02:36.840> was<00:02:37.840> that<00:02:37.989> a

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
and not doing anything more was that a

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:53.039 
and not doing anything more was that a
wolf<00:02:38.260> just<00:02:38.499> ran<00:02:38.680> past<00:02:51.569> but<00:02:52.569> then<00:02:52.719> I<00:02:52.750> suppose

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
wolf just ran past but then I suppose

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:54.539 
wolf just ran past but then I suppose
that's<00:02:53.199> better<00:02:53.409> than<00:02:53.680> them<00:02:53.799> doing<00:02:54.040> nothing<00:02:54.430> at

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
that's better than them doing nothing at

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.069 
that's better than them doing nothing at
all<00:02:54.669> in<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:54.879> first<00:02:55.090> place<00:02:55.239> or<00:02:55.599> moon<00:02:55.870> walking
