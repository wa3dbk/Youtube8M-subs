pretty sure you guys see that there are
six<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.910> them<00:00:21.029> in<00:00:21.210> this<00:00:21.330> room<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.900> there's<00:00:22.050> a

six of them in this room and there's a

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.540 
six of them in this room and there's a
switch<00:00:22.500> right<00:00:22.529> here<00:00:22.920> so<00:00:23.070> when<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.220> flip<00:00:23.430> the

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
switch right here so when I flip the

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.820 
switch right here so when I flip the
switch<00:00:23.689> boom<00:00:24.720> all<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.050> lights<00:00:25.230> come<00:00:25.439> on<00:00:25.529> and

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
switch boom all the lights come on and

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.580 
switch boom all the lights come on and
this<00:00:26.160> much<00:00:26.490> brighter<00:00:26.910> in<00:00:27.150> here<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:28.439> works

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
this much brighter in here and it works

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.759 
this much brighter in here and it works
with<00:00:28.859> anything<00:00:29.400> really<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.820> works<00:00:30.000> with<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.769> you

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
with anything really it works with a you

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.340 
with anything really it works with a you
know<00:00:31.890> buttons<00:00:32.550> like<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.480> had<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.690> button<00:00:34.050> not<00:00:34.230> on

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
know buttons like I had a button not on

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.440 
know buttons like I had a button not on
the<00:00:34.469> floor<00:00:34.710> or<00:00:35.100> anything<00:00:35.130> but<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.730> know<00:00:35.760> if<00:00:36.239> I

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
the floor or anything but you know if I

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.750 
the floor or anything but you know if I
had<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.600> button<00:00:36.840> there<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.530> operate<00:00:37.920> this<00:00:38.550> it

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
had a button there to operate this it

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.220 
had a button there to operate this it
would<00:00:38.910> work<00:00:39.090> as<00:00:39.239> well<00:00:39.270> but<00:00:39.719> that'd<00:00:39.870> be<00:00:39.989> kind<00:00:40.170> of

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
would work as well but that'd be kind of

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.630 
would work as well but that'd be kind of
pointless<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:40.980> just<00:00:41.219> kind<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.489> look<00:00:41.610> like

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
pointless and so just kind of look like

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.900 
pointless and so just kind of look like
this<00:00:42.559> that's<00:00:43.559> what<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.860> head<00:00:44.100> look<00:00:44.579> like<00:00:44.760> if

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
this that's what the head look like if

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.970 
this that's what the head look like if
it<00:00:45.030> was<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.210> button<00:00:45.390> but<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:46.230> know<00:00:46.350> if<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.710> wanted

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
it was a button but you know if I wanted

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.910 
it was a button but you know if I wanted
to<00:00:47.070> come<00:00:47.250> in<00:00:47.370> here<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:48.539> had<00:00:48.809> let's<00:00:49.680> say<00:00:49.890> I

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
to come in here and I had let's say I

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.720 
to come in here and I had let's say I
had<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:51.199> pressure<00:00:52.199> plate<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.800> just<00:00:53.280> come<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:53.520> here

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
had a pressure plate I just come in here

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.580 
had a pressure plate I just come in here
step<00:00:54.030> on<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.539> then<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:55.199> lights<00:00:55.379> would<00:00:55.530> be

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
step on it and then the lights would be

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.220 
step on it and then the lights would be
on<00:00:55.860> only<00:00:56.640> when<00:00:56.820> I'm<00:00:56.940> in<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.329> room<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.870> then<00:00:58.170> if

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
on only when I'm in the room and then if

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.380 
on only when I'm in the room and then if
I<00:00:58.320> left<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.890> just<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.640> know<00:00:59.670> it'd<00:00:59.879> be<00:00:59.910> off<00:01:00.149> so

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
I left it just you know it'd be off so

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.240 
I left it just you know it'd be off so
I'd<00:01:00.510> be<00:01:00.660> kind<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:00.930> cool<00:01:01.079> too<00:01:01.289> but<00:01:01.920> today<00:01:02.070> I'm

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
I'd be kind of cool too but today I'm

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.520

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.070 
to do redstone wiring for the redstone
lamps<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.880> light<00:01:08.909> up<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.240> room<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:09.720> I'm<00:01:09.900> going<00:01:10.049> to

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
lamps to light up a room so I'm going to

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.480 
lamps to light up a room so I'm going to
switch<00:01:10.290> over<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.590> another<00:01:10.799> world<00:01:11.189> where<00:01:11.460> I

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
switch over to another world where I

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.940 
switch over to another world where I
have<00:01:11.549> an<00:01:11.909> exact<00:01:12.299> copy<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:13.409> since<00:01:13.740> this<00:01:13.890> is

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
have an exact copy of this since this is

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.480 
have an exact copy of this since this is
on<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> different<00:01:14.670> world<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.659> mine<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.369> I<00:01:17.369> will

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
on a different world of mine and I will

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.240 
on a different world of mine and I will
be<00:01:18.000> right<00:01:18.150> back

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
be right back

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.550 
be right back
alright<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:20.520> I'm<00:01:20.670> back<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.180> here's<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.930> room

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
alright so I'm back and here's the room

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.320 
alright so I'm back and here's the room
I<00:01:22.590> put<00:01:23.040> torches<00:01:23.250> in<00:01:23.580> here<00:01:23.610> because<00:01:24.119> without

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
I put torches in here because without

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.240 
I put torches in here because without
them<00:01:24.720> in<00:01:24.930> here<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.619> would<00:01:25.740> be<00:01:25.920> pretty<00:01:26.130> much

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
light switch you know so I'm going to do

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.630 
light switch you know so I'm going to do
this<00:02:57.560> just<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.680> make<00:02:58.830> it<00:02:58.980> look<00:02:59.190> better<00:02:59.370> you

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
know and we're going to put redstone

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.400 
know and we're going to put redstone
under<00:03:05.250> here<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:06.060> then<00:03:06.780> we're<00:03:06.900> going<00:03:07.020> to<00:03:07.140> put

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
under here and then we're going to put

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.370 
under here and then we're going to put
one<00:03:08.250> right<00:03:08.459> there<00:03:08.700> one<00:03:08.910> block<00:03:09.390> of<00:03:09.540> wood<00:03:09.720> and

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380

one right there one block of wood and
put<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.830> switch<00:03:11.040> right<00:03:11.190> there<00:03:11.250> so<00:03:11.700> when<00:03:11.880> you

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
put the switch right there so when you

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.270 
put the switch right there so when you
do<00:03:12.150> that<00:03:12.360> it's<00:03:12.959> activating<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.650> redstone<00:03:14.070> as

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
do that it's activating the redstone as

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.070 
do that it's activating the redstone as
you<00:03:14.400> see<00:03:14.610> right<00:03:14.640> there<00:03:14.850> you<00:03:15.750> flip<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.050> switch

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
you see right there you flip the switch

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.620 
you see right there you flip the switch
the<00:03:16.620> red<00:03:16.769> stones<00:03:17.010> off<00:03:17.190> now<00:03:17.400> so<00:03:18.330> what<00:03:18.510> you're

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
the red stones off now so what you're

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.670 
the red stones off now so what you're
going<00:03:18.750> to<00:03:18.810> do<00:03:19.019> is<00:03:19.260> come<00:03:20.220> in<00:03:20.310> here<00:03:21.590> you're<00:03:22.590> gonna

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
going to do is come in here you're gonna

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.240 
going to do is come in here you're gonna
have<00:03:22.830> to<00:03:22.920> make<00:03:23.100> a<00:03:23.250> hole<00:03:23.519> -<00:03:24.739> too<00:03:25.739> low

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
have to make a hole - too low

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.070 
have to make a hole - too low
so<00:03:26.760> that<00:03:26.940> way<00:03:27.060> you<00:03:27.120> can<00:03:27.330> run<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.660> redstone

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
so that way you can run the redstone

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:34.550 
so that way you can run the redstone
through<00:03:28.440> here<00:03:28.769> and<00:03:29.450> activate<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:31.670> the<00:03:33.560> lights

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
through here and activate the the lights

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.940 
through here and activate the the lights
the<00:03:35.100> lamps<00:03:35.519> I<00:03:35.760> think<00:03:36.269> that's<00:03:36.390> what<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.630> code

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
the lamps I think that's what the code

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.560 
the lamps I think that's what the code
anyways<00:03:37.950> yeah<00:03:38.160> so<00:03:38.790> we're<00:03:39.060> gonna<00:03:39.150> put<00:03:39.390> one

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
anyways yeah so we're gonna put one

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.320 
anyways yeah so we're gonna put one
right<00:03:39.750> here<00:03:40.580> so<00:03:41.580> you're<00:03:41.700> gonna<00:03:41.760> put<00:03:42.060> redstone

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
right here so you're gonna put redstone

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:52.400 
right here so you're gonna put redstone
all<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.110> way<00:03:43.200> there<00:03:50.750> okay<00:03:51.750> I'm<00:03:51.930> back<00:03:52.110> now<00:03:52.170> I

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
all the way there okay I'm back now I

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.900 
all the way there okay I'm back now I
figured<00:03:52.860> out<00:03:52.950> what<00:03:53.100> the<00:03:53.160> problem<00:03:53.190> was<00:03:53.700> that

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
figured out what the problem was that

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.300 
figured out what the problem was that
was<00:03:54.209> just<00:03:54.239> a<00:03:54.540> complete<00:03:54.989> derp<00:03:55.320> face<00:03:55.620> move<00:03:55.950> on<00:03:56.160> my

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
was just a complete derp face move on my

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.120 
was just a complete derp face move on my
part<00:03:56.340> one<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:57.420> switch<00:03:57.690> has<00:03:57.870> to<00:03:58.049> be<00:03:58.080> on<00:03:58.440> before

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
part one the switch has to be on before

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.940 
part one the switch has to be on before
you<00:03:59.280> place<00:03:59.700> the<00:04:00.150> actual<00:04:00.330> torch<00:04:01.140> down<00:04:01.530> below

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
you place the actual torch down below

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.900 
you place the actual torch down below
the<00:04:02.250> lamp<00:04:03.180> so<00:04:03.600> here's<00:04:04.019> what<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:04.380> problem<00:04:04.500> was

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
the lamp so here's what the problem was

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.390 
the lamp so here's what the problem was
this<00:04:05.910> was<00:04:06.209> already<00:04:06.390> off<00:04:06.720> see<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:08.010> red<00:04:08.160> stones

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
this was already off see the red stones

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.570 
this was already off see the red stones
off<00:04:08.670> and<00:04:09.030> now<00:04:09.540> the<00:04:09.600> torch<00:04:09.900> is<00:04:10.080> on<00:04:10.430> but<00:04:11.430> when<00:04:11.549> you

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
off and now the torch is on but when you

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.000 
off and now the torch is on but when you
flip<00:04:11.940> the<00:04:11.970> switch<00:04:12.120> again<00:04:12.720> the<00:04:13.500> torch<00:04:13.769> will<00:04:13.920> be

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
flip the switch again the torch will be

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.550 
flip the switch again the torch will be
turned<00:04:14.220> off<00:04:14.430> as<00:04:14.670> will<00:04:15.180> the<00:04:15.360> lamp<00:04:15.600> so<00:04:16.410> we're

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
turned off as will the lamp so we're

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.120 
turned off as will the lamp so we're
going<00:04:16.680> to<00:04:16.739> cover<00:04:16.890> this<00:04:17.100> up

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
time you have to flip the switch to make

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.520 
time you have to flip the switch to make
sure<00:04:47.200> that<00:04:47.410> the<00:04:47.590> power<00:04:47.860> is<00:04:48.160> on<00:04:49.380> run<00:04:50.380> the

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
sure that the power is on run the

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.370 
sure that the power is on run the
redstone<00:04:51.010> over<00:04:51.430> here<00:04:51.700> redstone<00:04:52.240> only<00:04:52.480> runs<00:04:52.690> 15

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
redstone over here redstone only runs 15

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.380 
redstone over here redstone only runs 15
blocks<00:04:53.710> so<00:04:54.250> you<00:04:54.520> got<00:04:54.730> to<00:04:54.820> be<00:04:54.880> kind<00:04:55.120> of<00:04:55.180> careful

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
blocks so you got to be kind of careful

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.390 
blocks so you got to be kind of careful
with<00:04:55.690> how<00:04:55.810> you<00:04:55.840> place<00:04:56.140> it<00:04:56.380> then<00:04:57.040> you<00:04:57.160> place

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
with how you place it then you place

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.340 
with how you place it then you place
this<00:04:57.730> lamp<00:04:58.720> right<00:04:59.080> above<00:04:59.530> it<00:05:00.870> and<00:05:01.870> you<00:05:01.990> do<00:05:02.140> that

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
this lamp right above it and you do that

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.590 
this lamp right above it and you do that
cover<00:05:02.980> it<00:05:03.190> up

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
cover it up

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.500

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
just to make it look better you know oh

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.700 
just to make it look better you know oh
I<00:05:07.510> thought<00:05:07.780> I<00:05:07.840> just<00:05:07.900> place<00:05:08.230> a<00:05:08.260> block<00:05:08.500> down

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
I thought I just place a block down

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.510 
I thought I just place a block down
there<00:05:08.860> no<00:05:09.010> mine<00:05:09.900> and<00:05:11.040> now<00:05:12.040> that<00:05:12.190> the<00:05:12.310> lights

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
there no mine and now that the lights

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.440 
there no mine and now that the lights
are<00:05:12.730> off<00:05:13.030> you<00:05:13.960> can<00:05:14.110> flip<00:05:14.380> the<00:05:14.530> switch<00:05:15.390> now<00:05:16.390> the

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
are off you can flip the switch now the

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.360 
are off you can flip the switch now the
lights<00:05:16.690> are<00:05:16.780> on<00:05:16.900> so<00:05:17.230> you<00:05:17.830> can<00:05:17.950> do<00:05:18.070> that<00:05:18.220> as<00:05:18.340> many

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
lights are on so you can do that as many

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.250 
lights are on so you can do that as many
ways<00:05:18.820> as<00:05:18.850> you<00:05:19.210> want<00:05:19.450> you<00:05:19.660> know<00:05:19.780> like<00:05:19.990> say<00:05:20.200> you

know<00:05:34.930> if<00:05:35.110> that's<00:05:35.290> going<00:05:35.470> to<00:05:35.650> be<00:05:35.740> 15<00:05:36.520> blocks<00:05:36.850> or

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
know if that's going to be 15 blocks or

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.350 
know if that's going to be 15 blocks or
