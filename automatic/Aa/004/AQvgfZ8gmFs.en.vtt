people<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.799> um<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.310> think<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.149> might<00:02:03.329> be

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
people and um I think that might be

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.800 
people and um I think that might be
because<00:02:03.659> those<00:02:04.619> smaller<00:02:05.070> retailers

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810
