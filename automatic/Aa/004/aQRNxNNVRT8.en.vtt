00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
she she was in pain but I didn't know as

she she was in pain but I didn't know as
much<00:03:33.840> as<00:03:33.900> I<00:03:34.560> guess<00:03:34.919> as<00:03:35.069> much<00:03:35.099> as<00:03:35.400> it<00:03:35.549> was<00:03:35.699> and<00:03:36.319> we

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
much as I guess as much as it was and we

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:38.569 
much as I guess as much as it was and we
were<00:03:37.439> trained<00:03:37.769> and<00:03:37.919> we<00:03:38.040> were<00:03:38.129> ready<00:03:38.310> to<00:03:38.370> do

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
we felt ready but I mean I guess after

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.119

and what's going on behind the scenes a
little<00:05:11.640> bit<00:05:11.850> so<00:05:12.030> it's<00:05:12.150> nice<00:05:12.300> to<00:05:12.330> get<00:05:12.630> a<00:05:12.660> glimpse

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
little bit so it's nice to get a glimpse

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.350 
little bit so it's nice to get a glimpse
in<00:05:13.170> and<00:05:13.500> the<00:05:14.190> picture<00:05:14.520> sort<00:05:14.790> of<00:05:14.850> reflecting

it's inspiring for for children now I

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.660 
it's inspiring for for children now I
was<00:05:22.320> looking<00:05:22.590> at<00:05:22.740> it<00:05:22.860> I<00:05:23.010> was<00:05:23.130> struck<00:05:23.340> by<00:05:23.370> one

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:23.670 
was looking at it I was struck by one

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.730 
was looking at it I was struck by one
line<00:05:23.880> where<00:05:24.300> you<00:05:24.420> said<00:05:24.660> Canadians<00:05:25.350> skate

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
line where you said Canadians skate

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.010 
line where you said Canadians skate
differently<00:05:26.550> I'm<00:05:26.760> curious<00:05:27.150> what's<00:05:27.810> it<00:05:27.930> what's

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
differently I'm curious what's it what's

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.810 
differently I'm curious what's it what's
is<00:05:28.170> that<00:05:28.260> actually<00:05:28.560> here<00:05:28.740> well<00:05:29.460> there's<00:05:29.700> a

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
is that actually here well there's a

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.090 
is that actually here well there's a
certain<00:05:30.000> glide<00:05:30.450> and<00:05:30.960> flow<00:05:31.350> to<00:05:31.410> Canadian

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
certain glide and flow to Canadian

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.890 
certain glide and flow to Canadian
skaters<00:05:32.520> I<00:05:32.700> think<00:05:32.880> it's<00:05:33.000> just<00:05:33.180> built<00:05:33.540> within

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
skaters I think it's just built within

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.660 
skaters I think it's just built within
our<00:05:34.020> can<00:05:34.290> skate<00:05:34.560> programs<00:05:34.980> and<00:05:35.280> the<00:05:35.340> way<00:05:35.460> we've

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:35.670 
our can skate programs and the way we've

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.700 
our can skate programs and the way we've
trained<00:05:36.030> our<00:05:36.240> our<00:05:36.660> skaters<00:05:37.080> growing<00:05:37.410> up<00:05:37.560> we

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
trained our our skaters growing up we

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.350 
trained our our skaters growing up we
have<00:05:37.800> such<00:05:38.040> a<00:05:38.070> great<00:05:38.340> system<00:05:38.760> and<00:05:38.970> there's

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
have such a great system and there's

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.030 
have such a great system and there's
such<00:05:39.540> depth<00:05:39.870> in<00:05:40.110> Canadian<00:05:40.530> skating<00:05:40.920> it's

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040 
such depth in Canadian skating it's

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.860 
such depth in Canadian skating it's
