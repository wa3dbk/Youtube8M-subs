that's<00:01:21.509> one<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.930> reasons<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.470> have<00:01:22.740> some

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
that's one of the reasons I have some

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.649 
that's one of the reasons I have some
mini<00:01:23.580> meters<00:01:25.939> actually<00:01:26.939> while<00:01:27.299> I'm<00:01:27.479> all

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
mini meters actually while I'm all

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.359 
mini meters actually while I'm all
meters<00:01:27.960> there's<00:01:28.350> some<00:01:28.560> more<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.770> had<00:01:29.100> laying

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
meters there's some more I had laying

around<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:30.829> regular<00:01:31.829> bird<00:01:32.040> 43<00:01:32.700> at<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.909> left<00:01:33.329> the

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
around a regular bird 43 at the left the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.520 
around a regular bird 43 at the left the
coaxial<00:01:35.460> dynamics<00:01:36.299> which<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:36.960> like<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.200> bird

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
coaxial dynamics which is like a bird

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.350 
coaxial dynamics which is like a bird
clone<00:01:37.950> but<00:01:38.869> even<00:01:40.159> bigger<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.520> in<00:01:41.759> my<00:01:41.880> opinion

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
clone but even bigger and in my opinion

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.950 
clone but even bigger and in my opinion
better<00:01:42.600> than<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.110> bird<00:01:43.619> 43<00:01:44.540> next<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.810> in

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
better than the bird 43 next to it in

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.660 
better than the bird 43 next to it in

right<00:01:57.990> there<00:01:58.020> which<00:01:58.829> I<00:01:59.009> think<00:01:59.040> I'm<00:01:59.430> gonna<00:01:59.549> use

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
right there which I think I'm gonna use

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.240 
right there which I think I'm gonna use
to<00:01:59.939> replace<00:02:00.210> all<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.810> them<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.170> may<00:02:01.920> keep<00:02:02.189> one

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
to replace all of them I may keep one

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.440 
to replace all of them I may keep one
analog<00:02:02.969> meter<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:04.890> much-maligned<00:02:05.450> black

I'll<00:02:20.450> probably<00:02:20.750> keep<00:02:21.020> one<00:02:21.319> analog<00:02:21.830> meter<00:02:22.720> for

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
I'll probably keep one analog meter for

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.020 
I'll probably keep one analog meter for
backup<00:02:24.200> or<00:02:24.470> to<00:02:24.650> do<00:02:24.770> analog<00:02:25.280> adjustments

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
backup or to do analog adjustments

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.050 
backup or to do analog adjustments
because<00:02:26.240> it's<00:02:26.450> a<00:02:26.540> little<00:02:26.840> tricky<00:02:27.200> to<00:02:27.230> do<00:02:28.060> some

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
because it's a little tricky to do some

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.290 
because it's a little tricky to do some
adjustments<00:02:29.720> with<00:02:29.870> the<00:02:29.990> digital<00:02:30.440> meter<00:02:30.680> but

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
adjustments with the digital meter but

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.740 
adjustments with the digital meter but
it's<00:02:32.300> your<00:02:32.480> fun<00:02:32.750> to<00:02:32.870> play<00:02:33.080> with<00:02:34.510> started<00:02:35.510> to<00:02:35.630> do

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
it's your fun to play with started to do

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.229 
it's your fun to play with started to do
a<00:02:35.780> demo<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:36.440> hook<00:02:36.620> up<00:02:36.800> the<00:02:36.830> birds<00:02:37.580> and<00:02:37.910> compare

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
a demo and hook up the birds and compare

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.530 
a demo and hook up the birds and compare
them<00:02:38.390> to<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.630> black<00:02:38.900> cats<00:02:39.260> but<00:02:39.620> I<00:02:40.390> didn't<00:02:41.390> feel

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
them to the black cats but I didn't feel

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.449 
them to the black cats but I didn't feel
like<00:02:42.100> wasting<00:02:43.100> my<00:02:43.220> time<00:02:43.459> with<00:02:43.760> it<00:02:43.819> because<00:02:44.239> I

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
like wasting my time with it because I

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.710 
like wasting my time with it because I
don't<00:02:46.459> think<00:02:46.670> people<00:02:47.030> would<00:02:47.360> believe<00:02:47.690> me

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
don't think people would believe me

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.670 
don't think people would believe me

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
losing versus you know the original

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.920 
losing versus you know the original
transmitter<00:04:12.680> and<00:04:13.160> by<00:04:14.120> the<00:04:14.180> time<00:04:14.480> he<00:04:14.630> gets<00:04:14.840> to

transmitter and by the time he gets to

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.069 
transmitter and by the time he gets to
the<00:04:15.049> driver<00:04:15.470> and<00:04:16.370> if<00:04:17.209> I<00:04:17.299> wanted<00:04:17.660> to<00:04:17.780> I<00:04:17.810> could

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
the driver and if I wanted to I could

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:23.860 
the driver and if I wanted to I could
set<00:04:18.320> the<00:04:18.519> final<00:04:20.530> slug<00:04:21.530> on<00:04:22.180> 20<00:04:23.180> watts<00:04:23.419> and<00:04:23.750> it

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
set the final slug on 20 watts and it

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.560 
set the final slug on 20 watts and it
would<00:04:23.960> also<00:04:24.140> read<00:04:24.560> how<00:04:24.770> many<00:04:24.830> watts

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
would also read how many watts

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.160 
would also read how many watts
actually<00:04:25.990> reaching<00:04:26.530> the<00:04:27.540> pasture<00:04:28.540> final<00:04:28.990> and

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
actually reaching the pasture final and

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.870 
actually reaching the pasture final and
going<00:04:29.380> out<00:04:29.530> to<00:04:29.740> the<00:04:29.830> antenna<00:04:30.190> which<00:04:30.430> is<00:04:30.460> even

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
going out to the antenna which is even

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.660 
going out to the antenna which is even
less<00:04:31.120> than<00:04:31.390> the<00:04:31.840> driver<00:04:32.170> but<00:04:33.160> I<00:04:33.190> got<00:04:33.400> a<00:04:33.430> lot<00:04:33.640> of

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
less than the driver but I got a lot of

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:38.120 
less than the driver but I got a lot of
stuff<00:04:34.030> in<00:04:34.210> line<00:04:34.420> TV<00:04:34.930> i<00:04:34.960> filters<00:04:35.620> switch<00:04:35.890> boxes

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.870 

so<00:04:45.550> I<00:04:45.580> do<00:04:45.730> lose<00:04:46.180> quite<00:04:46.540> a<00:04:46.600> bit<00:04:46.900> of<00:04:47.050> DBS<00:04:47.880> going

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
so I do lose quite a bit of DBS going

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.130 
so I do lose quite a bit of DBS going
through<00:04:49.090> all<00:04:49.180> the<00:04:49.510> stuff<00:04:50.440> I<00:04:50.590> have<00:04:50.800> in<00:04:51.010> life<00:04:51.220> and
