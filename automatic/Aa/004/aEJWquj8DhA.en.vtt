00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
whatever I want anyway so I thought

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.040 
whatever I want anyway so I thought
because<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.649> have<00:00:43.980> very<00:00:44.910> very<00:00:45.210> little<00:00:45.510> tied<00:00:45.870> up

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
because I have very very little tied up

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.950 
because I have very very little tied up
into<00:00:46.230> this<00:00:46.469> wolf<00:00:46.739> bro<00:00:47.180> I<00:00:48.180> would<00:00:48.570> try<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.780> make

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
into this wolf bro I would try and make

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.020 
into this wolf bro I would try and make
it<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.170> little<00:00:49.289> bit<00:00:49.530> more<00:00:49.680> water<00:00:50.010> resistant<00:00:50.940> if

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
it a little bit more water resistant if

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.479 
it a little bit more water resistant if
anything<00:00:51.570> hopefully<00:00:52.050> go<00:00:52.469> for<00:00:52.680> waterproof<00:00:53.190> but

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
anything hopefully go for waterproof but

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.139 
anything hopefully go for waterproof but
yeah<00:00:54.390> knowing<00:00:55.019> goes<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.530> far

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
yeah knowing goes so far

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.840 
yeah knowing goes so far
anyhow<00:00:58.129> now<00:00:59.210> if<00:01:00.210> you're<00:01:00.570> going<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.079> do<00:01:01.260> this

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
anyhow now if you're going to do this

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.450 
anyhow now if you're going to do this
probably<00:01:02.850> silicone<00:01:03.480> would<00:01:03.690> be<00:01:03.809> better<00:01:04.080> I

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
probably silicone would be better I

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.040 
probably silicone would be better I
don't<00:01:05.460> have<00:01:05.610> any<00:01:05.760> silicone<00:01:06.180> on<00:01:06.330> hand<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:06.840> I

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
don't have any silicone on hand so I

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.800 
don't have any silicone on hand so I
used<00:01:07.410> hot<00:01:07.620> glue<00:01:07.680> okay<00:01:08.610> they<00:01:09.210> don't<00:01:09.420> put<00:01:09.690> the

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
used hot glue okay they don't put the

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.410 
used hot glue okay they don't put the
receiver<00:01:10.170> box<00:01:10.650> lid<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.250> very<00:01:11.640> well<00:01:11.730> on<00:01:12.210> this

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
receiver box lid on very well on this

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.170 
receiver box lid on very well on this
car<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.990> actually<00:01:13.320> kind<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.590> sucks<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:14.820> it

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
car it actually kind of sucks so it

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.880 
car it actually kind of sucks so it
leaves<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.450> lot<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.720> gaps<00:01:15.900> for<00:01:16.230> water<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.650> stuff

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
leaves a lot of gaps for water and stuff

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.860 
leaves a lot of gaps for water and stuff
to<00:01:17.010> get<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.760> did<00:01:18.120> actually<00:01:18.330> take<00:01:18.690> this

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.870 
to get in and I did actually take this

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.650 
to get in and I did actually take this
thing<00:01:19.080> out<00:01:19.200> in<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.440> snow<00:01:19.970> and<00:01:20.970> on<00:01:21.120> the<00:01:21.210> roadway

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
thing out in the snow and on the roadway

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.480 
thing out in the snow and on the roadway
a<00:01:21.870> little<00:01:22.200> over<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.380> week<00:01:22.470> ago<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.190> you<00:01:23.340> can

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
a little over a week ago and you can

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.160 
a little over a week ago and you can
tell<00:01:23.700> there's<00:01:23.880> still<00:01:24.030> some<00:01:24.180> mud<00:01:24.390> in<00:01:24.420> there<00:01:24.660> and

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
tell there's still some mud in there and

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.280 
tell there's still some mud in there and
it<00:01:26.100> did<00:01:26.340> fine<00:01:26.910> as<00:01:27.180> far<00:01:27.420> as<00:01:27.480> it<00:01:27.780> still<00:01:28.050> runs

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
it did fine as far as it still runs

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.610 
it did fine as far as it still runs
great<00:01:29.330> but<00:01:30.330> I<00:01:30.360> didn't<00:01:30.780> really<00:01:31.050> get<00:01:31.230> it<00:01:31.410> like

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
great but I didn't really get it like

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.480 
great but I didn't really get it like
souping<00:01:32.310> wet<00:01:32.550> or<00:01:32.730> anything<00:01:32.760> so<00:01:34.220> it<00:01:35.220> really

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
souping wet or anything so it really

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.920 
souping wet or anything so it really
does<00:01:35.700> suck<00:01:35.910> on<00:01:36.120> the<00:01:36.180> snow<00:01:36.390> though<00:01:36.570> there's<00:01:36.750> no

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
does suck on the snow though there's no

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.570 
does suck on the snow though there's no
traction<00:01:37.320> here<00:01:37.680> there's<00:01:37.950> just<00:01:38.100> way<00:01:38.220> too<00:01:38.250> much

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
traction here there's just way too much

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.150 
traction here there's just way too much
juice<00:01:38.970> for<00:01:39.270> this<00:01:39.900> in<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.410> machine<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.950> just

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
juice for this in this machine it just

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.990 
juice for this in this machine it just
has<00:01:41.280> no<00:01:41.490> traction

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
has no traction

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.740 
has no traction
now<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:43.610> converted<00:01:44.610> mine<00:01:44.760> to<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.940> 3<00:01:45.150> cell<00:01:45.360> setup

was<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.800> hot<00:02:02.070> glued<00:02:02.100> all<00:02:02.550> the<00:02:02.670> connections<00:02:03.210> in

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
was I hot glued all the connections in

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.110 
was I hot glued all the connections in
so<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.830> connections<00:02:05.310> are<00:02:05.430> all<00:02:05.580> completely

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
so the connections are all completely

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.910 
so the connections are all completely
covered<00:02:06.540> so<00:02:06.900> there's<00:02:07.080> no<00:02:07.230> unplugging<00:02:07.680> these

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
covered so there's no unplugging these

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.510 
covered so there's no unplugging these
things<00:02:08.190> now<00:02:08.399> as<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:08.789> wreck<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.319> I<00:02:10.520> totally

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
things now as I wreck it I totally

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
three cell conversion as I'm also I was

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.550 
three cell conversion as I'm also I was
also<00:02:30.130> able<00:02:30.250> to<00:02:30.430> fill<00:02:30.670> up<00:02:30.700> any<00:02:31.060> holes<00:02:31.840> in<00:02:32.110> here

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
also able to fill up any holes in here

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.240 
also able to fill up any holes in here
as<00:02:33.430> well<00:02:34.300> as<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.690> locking<00:02:35.110> pins<00:02:35.440> were<00:02:35.890> where

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
as well as the locking pins were where

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.310 
as well as the locking pins were where
the<00:02:36.340> stock<00:02:36.580> battery<00:02:37.030> would<00:02:37.180> be<00:02:37.210> and<00:02:37.690> in<00:02:37.990> here

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
the stock battery would be and in here

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.840 
the stock battery would be and in here
because<00:02:38.770> these<00:02:38.890> are<00:02:38.950> all<00:02:39.160> areas<00:02:39.370> where<00:02:39.670> water

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
because these are all areas where water

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.970 
because these are all areas where water
can<00:02:40.090> get<00:02:40.240> in<00:02:40.420> there's<00:02:40.750> also<00:02:40.930> a<00:02:41.110> piece<00:02:41.440> in<00:02:41.650> here

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
can get in there's also a piece in here

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.520 
can get in there's also a piece in here
to<00:02:42.250> where<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:42.640> switches<00:02:43.090> now<00:02:43.810> I<00:02:43.870> managed<00:02:44.470> to

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
everything and see if anything breaks

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.190 
everything and see if anything breaks
down<00:03:58.630> on<00:03:58.930> me<00:03:59.080> which<00:03:59.740> if<00:04:00.580> it<00:04:00.700> does<00:04:00.910> it<00:04:01.120> does<00:04:01.390> it's

down on me which if it does it does it's

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.560 
down on me which if it does it does it's
not<00:04:02.500> a<00:04:02.530> big<00:04:02.800> deal<00:04:03.040> at<00:04:03.459> least<00:04:03.790> we've<00:04:04.360> all

not a big deal at least we've all

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.810 
not a big deal at least we've all
learned<00:04:04.840> something<00:04:05.190> about<00:04:06.190> what<00:04:06.400> you<00:04:06.550> can<00:04:06.790> and

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
learned something about what you can and

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.940 
learned something about what you can and
can't<00:04:07.180> do<00:04:07.480> here<00:04:07.870> with<00:04:08.020> this<00:04:08.230> particular<00:04:08.560> toy

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
can't do here with this particular toy

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.640 
can't do here with this particular toy
now<00:04:09.580> those<00:04:09.970> that<00:04:10.120> want<00:04:10.300> to<00:04:10.360> know<00:04:10.510> I<00:04:10.840> had<00:04:11.620> a

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
now those that want to know I had a

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.920 
now those that want to know I had a
scorpion<00:04:12.280> I<00:04:12.489> did<00:04:12.940> mention<00:04:13.150> that<00:04:13.330> before<00:04:13.570> on

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
scorpion I did mention that before on

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.289 
scorpion I did mention that before on
another<00:04:14.230> video<00:04:14.350> I<00:04:14.560> believe<00:04:14.760> the<00:04:15.760> scorpion

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
another video I believe the scorpion

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.180 
another video I believe the scorpion
body<00:04:16.600> pops<00:04:17.560> right<00:04:17.830> on<00:04:17.890> this<00:04:18.190> thing

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
body pops right on this thing

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.630 
body pops right on this thing
and<00:04:19.670> it<00:04:19.760> actually<00:04:20.180> looks<00:04:20.420> really<00:04:20.810> cool<00:04:21.640> even

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
and it actually looks really cool even

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.300 
and it actually looks really cool even
with<00:04:22.790> the<00:04:22.880> stock<00:04:23.120> tires<00:04:23.390> I<00:04:23.890> actually<00:04:24.890> like<00:04:25.190> the

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
with the stock tires I actually like the

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.160 
with the stock tires I actually like the
look<00:04:25.490> of<00:04:25.610> that<00:04:25.900> that's<00:04:26.900> pretty<00:04:27.230> neat<00:04:27.670> now

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
look of that that's pretty neat now

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.380 
look of that that's pretty neat now
before<00:04:30.170> you<00:04:30.680> guys<00:04:30.860> decide<00:04:31.400> to<00:04:31.520> try<00:04:31.700> asking<00:04:31.940> I'm

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
before you guys decide to try asking I'm

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.190 
before you guys decide to try asking I'm
gonna<00:04:32.540> tell<00:04:32.750> you<00:04:32.840> ahead<00:04:32.930> of<00:04:33.050> time<00:04:34.840> no<00:04:35.840> you

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
gonna tell you ahead of time no you

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.110 
gonna tell you ahead of time no you
cannot<00:04:36.650> convert<00:04:37.640> the<00:04:39.250> Scorpion<00:04:40.250> tires<00:04:40.580> upon

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
cannot convert the Scorpion tires upon

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.320 
cannot convert the Scorpion tires upon
to<00:04:41.420> this<00:04:41.780> particular<00:04:42.230> chassis<00:04:43.040> I<00:04:43.220> tried<00:04:44.150> it

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
to this particular chassis I tried it

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.120 
to this particular chassis I tried it
because<00:04:44.510> I<00:04:44.720> still<00:04:45.020> have<00:04:45.200> my<00:04:45.320> scorpion<00:04:45.830> tires

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
because I still have my scorpion tires

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.160 
because I still have my scorpion tires
and<00:04:46.520> the<00:04:47.480> scorpion<00:04:47.960> tires<00:04:48.170> will<00:04:48.470> not<00:04:48.500> mount<00:04:49.190> on

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.170 
and the scorpion tires will not mount on

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.080 
and the scorpion tires will not mount on
this<00:04:51.170> particular<00:04:51.590> body<00:04:52.010> this<00:04:52.730> thing<00:04:52.940> is

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
this particular body this thing is

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.300 
this particular body this thing is
basically<00:04:53.270> made<00:04:53.960> after<00:04:54.470> the<00:04:54.560> scorpion<00:04:55.100> or<00:04:55.190> the

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
basically made after the scorpion or the

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.850 
basically made after the scorpion or the
scorpions<00:04:55.790> made<00:04:56.000> after<00:04:56.360> this<00:04:56.540> one<00:04:56.840> based<00:04:57.590> on

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
scorpions made after this one based on

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.400 
scorpions made after this one based on
you<00:04:58.340> know<00:04:58.370> similarities<00:04:59.210> but<00:04:59.450> they<00:04:59.930> also<00:05:00.110> have

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
you know similarities but they also have

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.920 
you know similarities but they also have
a<00:05:00.440> longer<00:05:00.800> axle<00:05:01.340> shaft<00:05:01.610> on<00:05:01.850> the<00:05:01.940> Scorpion<00:05:02.570> and

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
a longer axle shaft on the Scorpion and

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.050 
a longer axle shaft on the Scorpion and
all<00:05:03.140> that<00:05:03.680> and<00:05:03.860> you<00:05:03.950> know<00:05:04.160> what<00:05:04.340> I'm<00:05:04.640> not<00:05:04.820> going

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
all that and you know what I'm not going

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.420 
all that and you know what I'm not going
to<00:05:05.120> spend<00:05:05.360> the<00:05:05.450> time<00:05:05.480> or<00:05:06.470> energy<00:05:06.770> to<00:05:07.070> try

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
to spend the time or energy to try

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.510 
to spend the time or energy to try
converting<00:05:08.060> the<00:05:08.180> old<00:05:08.870> parts<00:05:09.440> onto<00:05:09.740> this<00:05:10.220> thing

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
converting the old parts onto this thing

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.880 
converting the old parts onto this thing
and<00:05:10.820> in<00:05:11.480> fact<00:05:11.690> I'm<00:05:11.930> pretty<00:05:12.200> sure<00:05:12.350> I<00:05:12.410> got<00:05:12.650> rid<00:05:12.860> of

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:12.890 
and in fact I'm pretty sure I got rid of

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:14.620 
and in fact I'm pretty sure I got rid of
all<00:05:13.100> the<00:05:13.220> old<00:05:13.340> parts<00:05:13.550> except<00:05:14.060> I<00:05:14.210> still<00:05:14.270> have

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
all the old parts except I still have

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.170 
all the old parts except I still have
the<00:05:14.810> four<00:05:15.020> tires<00:05:15.290> in<00:05:15.530> the<00:05:15.620> body<00:05:15.800> shell<00:05:16.180> because

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
the four tires in the body shell because

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.750 
the four tires in the body shell because
the<00:05:17.300> body<00:05:17.480> shell<00:05:17.750> mounts<00:05:18.140> on<00:05:18.290> this<00:05:18.500> so<00:05:18.770> if<00:05:19.580> I

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
the body shell mounts on this so if I

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.760 
the body shell mounts on this so if I
ever<00:05:19.940> kill<00:05:20.450> this<00:05:20.720> shell<00:05:20.990> or<00:05:21.170> I<00:05:21.260> find<00:05:21.530> another

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
ever kill this shell or I find another

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.280 
ever kill this shell or I find another
RC<00:05:22.190> I'd<00:05:22.340> rather<00:05:22.610> have<00:05:22.880> this<00:05:23.030> shell<00:05:23.330> on<00:05:23.570> then

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290 
RC I'd rather have this shell on then

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.110 
RC I'd rather have this shell on then
I'll<00:05:24.470> swap<00:05:24.800> the<00:05:25.010> shower<00:05:25.220> than<00:05:25.640> this<00:05:25.850> one

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
I'll swap the shower than this one

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.580 
I'll swap the shower than this one
scorpion<00:05:26.660> shell<00:05:27.070> but<00:05:28.660> anyways<00:05:29.660> like<00:05:30.200> I<00:05:30.350> said

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
scorpion shell but anyways like I said

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.250 
scorpion shell but anyways like I said
if<00:05:30.770> you're<00:05:30.890> gonna<00:05:31.160> do<00:05:31.430> this<00:05:31.700> I<00:05:32.260> would

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
if you're gonna do this I would

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.560 
if you're gonna do this I would
recommend<00:05:33.380> silicone<00:05:34.250> not<00:05:34.490> hot<00:05:34.760> glue<00:05:35.060> it's

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
recommend silicone not hot glue it's

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.140 
recommend silicone not hot glue it's
just<00:05:35.840> I<00:05:35.990> didn't<00:05:36.350> have<00:05:36.500> a<00:05:36.530> silicone<00:05:37.040> I<00:05:37.340> decided

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
just I didn't have a silicone I decided

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.380 
just I didn't have a silicone I decided
to<00:05:38.419> opt<00:05:38.630> it<00:05:38.900> for<00:05:39.140> hot<00:05:39.290> glue<00:05:39.500> because<00:05:40.490> of<00:05:40.910> my

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:41.390 
to opt it for hot glue because of my

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.230 
to opt it for hot glue because of my
conversion<00:05:41.990> here<00:05:42.350> I<00:05:42.560> really<00:05:43.550> don't<00:05:43.730> care<00:05:43.790> it

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
conversion here I really don't care it

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.190 
conversion here I really don't care it
doesn't<00:05:44.540> matter<00:05:44.720> to<00:05:44.900> me

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
doesn't matter to me

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.420 
doesn't matter to me
so<00:05:45.940> anyways<00:05:47.110> we<00:05:48.110> will<00:05:48.320> check<00:05:48.830> the<00:05:48.980> next<00:05:49.190> video

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
so anyways we will check the next video

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.170 
so anyways we will check the next video
and<00:05:49.760> we'll<00:05:50.110> start<00:05:51.110> writing<00:05:51.410> that<00:05:51.590> and<00:05:52.180> see

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
and we'll start writing that and see

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.090 
and we'll start writing that and see
what<00:05:53.390> we<00:05:53.540> can<00:05:53.720> do<00:05:54.050> to<00:05:54.200> this<00:05:54.320> thing<00:05:54.560> if<00:05:54.740> any

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.100 
what we can do to this thing if any

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.440 
what we can do to this thing if any
damage<00:05:55.520> at<00:05:55.669> all<00:05:55.790> as<00:05:56.210> far<00:05:56.419> as<00:05:56.500> liquid<00:05:57.500> goes<00:05:57.740> and

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.450 
damage at all as far as liquid goes and

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:01.750 
damage at all as far as liquid goes and
