00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
can't fold and do each other it's really

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.100 
can't fold and do each other it's really
obvious<00:04:09.480> once<00:04:10.260> you<00:04:10.380> get<00:04:10.590> it<00:04:11.810> where<00:04:12.810> everything

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
obvious once you get it where everything

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.740 
obvious once you get it where everything
kind<00:04:13.319> of<00:04:13.410> goes<00:04:15.769> so<00:04:16.769> you<00:04:16.980> should<00:04:17.220> fold<00:04:17.519> in<00:04:17.790> so

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
kind of goes so you should fold in so

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.539 
kind of goes so you should fold in so
that<00:04:18.780> there<00:04:19.139> they<00:04:19.500> were<00:04:19.650> like<00:04:19.889> this<00:04:20.190> they

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
that there they were like this they

that there they were like this they
should<00:04:20.760> fold<00:04:21.000> upwards<00:04:21.299> so<00:04:22.049> let<00:04:22.229> them<00:04:22.380> lined<00:04:22.590> up

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
should fold upwards so let them lined up

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:29.330 
should fold upwards so let them lined up
like<00:04:22.860> this<00:04:25.820> his<00:04:26.820> head<00:04:27.150> is<00:04:27.180> going<00:04:27.630> to<00:04:28.340> fold

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
like this his head is going to fold

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.810 
like this his head is going to fold

these around actually first and then

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.170 
these around actually first and then
this<00:04:33.180> these<00:04:33.510> will<00:04:33.840> snap<00:04:34.380> together<00:04:35.150> after<00:04:36.150> a

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
this these will snap together after a

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.750 
this these will snap together after a
little<00:04:36.330> bit<00:04:36.479> of<00:04:36.600> meddling<00:04:37.320> and<00:04:37.560> like<00:04:38.520> that

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
little bit of meddling and like that

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.719

only is he a toaster with a plug that
kinda<00:05:16.620> looks<00:05:16.680> like<00:05:16.830> a<00:05:16.950> tailor<00:05:17.220> kinda<00:05:17.520> looks

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 
kinda looks like a tailor kinda looks

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:20.659 
kinda looks like a tailor kinda looks
like<00:05:17.729> a<00:05:17.820> mechanical<00:05:18.389> pig<00:05:19.310> if<00:05:20.310> you<00:05:20.430> kind<00:05:20.550> of

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669 
like a mechanical pig if you kind of

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:23.090 
like a mechanical pig if you kind of
like<00:05:20.820> this<00:05:21.000> as<00:05:21.150> a<00:05:21.180> tail<00:05:21.479> and<00:05:21.510> then<00:05:22.020> there's<00:05:22.919> the

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
like this as a tail and then there's the
