00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.990 
2 which is equal to 16 right 8 15 + 6
which<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.229> 2<00:01:37.619> cross<00:01:37.979> 3<00:01:38.430> 2<00:01:39.680> matrix<00:01:40.680> so<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:41.759> is

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
which is a 2 cross 3 2 matrix so this is

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.609 
which is a 2 cross 3 2 matrix so this is
the<00:01:42.119> answer<00:01:42.299> now<00:01:43.110> let's<00:01:43.320> see<00:01:43.619> if<00:01:43.860> we<00:01:44.189> can<00:01:44.399> do<00:01:44.640> B

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
the answer now let's see if we can do B

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.700 
the answer now let's see if we can do B
multiplied<00:01:46.619> by<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:47.720> now<00:01:48.720> if<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.439> have<00:01:49.560> to

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
multiplied by a now if I have to

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.969 
multiplied by a now if I have to
multiply<00:01:49.860> B<00:01:50.280> by<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.759> let's<00:01:51.600> write<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:52.020> here<00:01:52.649> and

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
multiply B by a let's write a here and

00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:02.179 
multiply B by a let's write a here and
see<00:01:53.909> if<00:01:54.030> we<00:01:54.180> can<00:01:54.360> do<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.540> 3<00:01:54.930> -<00:01:55.680> 4<00:01:56.670> -<00:01:57.590> 1<00:01:58.590> 1<00:02:00.320> now<00:02:01.320> V

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
see if we can do a 3 - 4 - 1 1 now V

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.139 
see if we can do a 3 - 4 - 1 1 now V
this<00:02:02.939> is<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.320> 2<00:02:04.320> cross<00:02:04.350> 3<00:02:04.590> 3<00:02:05.040> cross<00:02:05.250> 2<00:02:05.280> matrix<00:02:05.610> and

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
this is a 2 cross 3 3 cross 2 matrix and

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:13.140 
this is a 2 cross 3 3 cross 2 matrix and
this<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.789> 2<00:02:08.789> cross<00:02:08.819> 3<00:02:09.239> matrix<00:02:11.300> matrix

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
this is a 2 cross 3 matrix matrix

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.030 
this is a 2 cross 3 matrix matrix
right<00:02:14.150> now<00:02:14.870> it<00:02:15.080> is<00:02:15.110> too<00:02:15.910> and<00:02:16.910> then<00:02:17.150> first<00:02:18.040> right

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
right now it is too and then first right

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:30.520 
right now it is too and then first right
so<00:02:19.220> this<00:02:19.400> will<00:02:19.700> be<00:02:23.530> 2<00:02:24.530> into<00:02:24.560> 3<00:02:25.220> 6<00:02:27.580> right<00:02:28.580> and<00:02:29.230> 2<00:02:30.230> 2

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
so this will be 2 into 3 6 right and 2 2

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.660 
so this will be 2 into 3 6 right and 2 2
1<00:02:30.770> 2

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.820 

now<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.730> next<00:02:35.209> would<00:02:35.420> be<00:02:35.450> this<00:02:37.060> into<00:02:38.060> this

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
now the next would be this into this

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:48.960 
now the next would be this into this
which<00:02:39.830> is<00:02:42.280> 4<00:02:43.280> plus<00:02:44.030> 1<00:02:44.170> and<00:02:45.170> Row<00:02:45.860> 1<00:02:46.130> column<00:02:46.959> 3<00:02:47.959> is

which is 4 plus 1 and Row 1 column 3 is
8<00:02:50.230> plus<00:02:51.230> 1<00:02:51.700> now<00:02:52.700> let's<00:02:53.180> go<00:02:53.360> to<00:02:53.420> Row<00:02:53.630> 2<00:02:54.100> Row<00:02:55.100> 2

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
8 plus 1 now let's go to Row 2 Row 2

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:10.270 
8 plus 1 now let's go to Row 2 Row 2
would<00:02:55.519> be<00:02:55.660> 9<00:02:57.850> plus<00:03:00.489> 4<00:03:02.530> then<00:03:04.269> 6<00:03:05.269> plus<00:03:06.160> 2<00:03:07.840> 12<00:03:09.280> plus

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
would be 9 plus 4 then 6 plus 2 12 plus

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.070 
would be 9 plus 4 then 6 plus 2 12 plus
2<00:03:11.410> now<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:12.470> last<00:03:12.799> row<00:03:13.239> when<00:03:14.239> we<00:03:14.390> do<00:03:14.569> product

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
2 now the last row when we do product

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.740 
2 now the last row when we do product
with<00:03:15.290> each<00:03:15.470> of<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:15.739> columns<00:03:16.310> will<00:03:16.549> get<00:03:16.790> 3<00:03:17.480> plus

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
with each of the columns will get 3 plus

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:30.360 
with each of the columns will get 3 plus
4<00:03:18.320> 2<00:03:19.130> +<00:03:19.549> 2<00:03:19.970> +<00:03:20.920> 4<00:03:21.920> +<00:03:22.730> 2<00:03:23.570> right<00:03:24.290> so<00:03:25.120> we<00:03:26.120> get<00:03:26.390> 8<00:03:27.489> 5<00:03:28.489> 9<00:03:29.350> 13

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
4 2 + 2 + 4 + 2 right so we get 8 5 9 13

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:41.789 
4 2 + 2 + 4 + 2 right so we get 8 5 9 13

8 14 7 4 + 6 which is a 3 cross 3 matrix
now<00:03:42.799> you<00:03:42.859> see<00:03:43.040> the<00:03:43.160> difference<00:03:43.579> so<00:03:44.120> in<00:03:44.420> matrix

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
now you see the difference so in matrix

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.800 
now you see the difference so in matrix

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
multiplication a cross B is not equal to

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.759 
multiplication a cross B is not equal to

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
be multiplied by a this is a difference

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.740 
be multiplied by a this is a difference
okay<00:03:54.769> and<00:03:55.280> the<00:03:55.700> other<00:03:55.880> one<00:03:56.120> which<00:03:56.390> you<00:03:56.540> need<00:03:56.630> to

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
okay and the other one which you need to

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.160 
okay and the other one which you need to
notice<00:03:57.109> is<00:03:57.319> if<00:03:57.620> you<00:03:57.829> have<00:03:59.019> M<00:04:00.019> cross<00:04:00.560> n<00:04:01.100> matrix

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
notice is if you have M cross n matrix

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.979 
notice is if you have M cross n matrix
multiplied<00:04:03.170> with<00:04:04.510> matrix<00:04:05.510> of<00:04:05.660> order<00:04:05.959> n<00:04:06.590> cross

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
multiplied with matrix of order n cross

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:16.210 
multiplied with matrix of order n cross
Q<00:04:09.579> you<00:04:10.579> get<00:04:10.910> a<00:04:11.299> result<00:04:12.049> is<00:04:12.400> M<00:04:13.400> cross<00:04:13.850> Q<00:04:15.220> right

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
Q you get a result is M cross Q right

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.129 
Q you get a result is M cross Q right
this<00:04:16.789> is<00:04:17.090> another<00:04:17.329> difference<00:04:17.630> which<00:04:18.109> you

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
this is another difference which you

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:23.740 
this is another difference which you
have<00:04:18.350> learnt<00:04:18.650> if<00:04:19.479> the<00:04:20.479> number<00:04:20.900> of<00:04:21.019> rows<00:04:22.750> you

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750
