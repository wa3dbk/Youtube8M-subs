00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.320 
and instantly finish now let's go ahead
and<00:01:13.530> build<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.369> level<00:01:14.790> 1<00:01:14.970> will<00:01:15.119> give<00:01:15.150> you

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
and build it so level 1 will give you

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.359 
and build it so level 1 will give you
part<00:01:15.509> 35<00:01:15.960> power<00:01:16.200> as<00:01:17.030> instantly<00:01:18.030> finish<00:01:18.990> it

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
part 35 power as instantly finish it

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.249 
part 35 power as instantly finish it
then<00:01:20.369> level<00:01:20.700> 2<00:01:20.970> level<00:01:22.640> 3<00:01:23.960> stand<00:01:24.960> here<00:01:25.110> we<00:01:25.170> go

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
then level 2 level 3 stand here we go

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.480 
then level 2 level 3 stand here we go
level<00:01:25.470> 3<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:25.890> here<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:27.950> then<00:01:28.950> level<00:01:29.250> 4

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
level 3 is here and then level 4

power<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.420> usually<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.409> infernals<00:01:37.890> are<00:01:37.979> only

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
power and usually the infernals are only

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.640 
power and usually the infernals are only
for<00:01:38.400> 18,000<00:01:39.360> power<00:01:39.540> now<00:01:40.200> let's<00:01:40.380> go<00:01:40.470> ahead<00:01:40.530> and

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
for 18,000 power now let's go ahead and

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.380 
for 18,000 power now let's go ahead and
check<00:01:40.770> out<00:01:40.920> how<00:01:41.070> many<00:01:41.340> points<00:01:41.490> we<00:01:41.640> have<00:01:41.670> now<00:01:41.909> so

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
check out how many points we have now so

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.999
