you're going to have to measure the

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.730 
you're going to have to measure the
structure<00:02:07.150> after<00:02:07.690> it's<00:02:07.810> all<00:02:07.990> put<00:02:08.200> together<00:02:08.320> to

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
structure after it's all put together to

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.499 
structure after it's all put together to
know<00:02:08.890> how<00:02:09.070> big<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.429> pieces<00:02:09.820> of<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.090> tarp<00:02:10.330> need

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
know how big the pieces of the tarp need

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.900 
know how big the pieces of the tarp need
to<00:02:10.690> be<00:02:10.840> because<00:02:11.650> of<00:02:11.800> adding<00:02:12.130> the<00:02:12.280> fittings<00:02:12.670> it

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
to be because of adding the fittings it

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.100 
to be because of adding the fittings it
adds<00:02:13.150> height<00:02:13.540> to<00:02:13.960> the<00:02:14.110> piece<00:02:14.830> of<00:02:15.010> PVC<00:02:15.520> pipe

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
adds height to the piece of PVC pipe

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.570 
adds height to the piece of PVC pipe
when<00:02:17.110> you're<00:02:17.260> ready<00:02:17.470> to<00:02:17.680> tape<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.100> pieces<00:02:18.430> of

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
when you're ready to tape the pieces of

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.760 
when you're ready to tape the pieces of
the<00:02:18.730> tarp<00:02:18.970> together<00:02:19.390> it's<00:02:19.750> easier<00:02:20.320> to<00:02:20.500> get<00:02:20.650> the

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
the tarp together it's easier to get the

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.040 
the tarp together it's easier to get the
big<00:02:20.950> long<00:02:21.280> piece<00:02:21.640> and<00:02:22.000> put<00:02:22.180> it<00:02:22.209> up<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:22.750> over

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
big long piece and put it up and over

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.680 
big long piece and put it up and over
the<00:02:23.200> frame<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:23.530> then<00:02:24.400> tape<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:25.060> pointed

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
the frame and then tape the pointed

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:48.390 
the frame and then tape the pointed
piece<00:02:25.930> to<00:02:26.290> it

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
all the way down the side one thing that

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.240 
all the way down the side one thing that
I<00:03:05.600> suggest<00:03:05.989> doing<00:03:06.080> when<00:03:06.470> you're<00:03:06.620> done<00:03:06.739> taping

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
I suggest doing when you're done taping

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.630 
I suggest doing when you're done taping
is<00:03:07.459> to<00:03:07.640> really<00:03:07.910> push<00:03:08.510> and<00:03:08.930> rub<00:03:09.560> along<00:03:09.709> the<00:03:10.400> tape

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
is to really push and rub along the tape

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.550 
is to really push and rub along the tape
to<00:03:10.850> make<00:03:10.970> sure<00:03:11.180> that<00:03:11.300> it<00:03:11.480> adheres<00:03:11.660> all<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.410> way

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560
