see it's a sort of like this for some
soccer<00:02:20.110> type<00:02:20.380> shape<00:02:21.569> done<00:02:22.569> it<00:02:22.720> in<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:22.930> water

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880

of<00:02:26.079> it<00:02:26.370> bring<00:02:27.370> it<00:02:27.489> out<00:02:27.610> so<00:02:27.819> I<00:02:27.940> think<00:02:28.829> this<00:02:29.829> we

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
of it bring it out so I think this we

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.539 
of it bring it out so I think this we
need<00:02:30.190> to<00:02:30.370> act<00:02:30.610> fairly<00:02:31.030> quickly<00:02:32.280> put<00:02:33.280> it<00:02:33.370> over

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
need to act fairly quickly put it over
