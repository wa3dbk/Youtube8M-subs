 know what you from the beginning 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.640
 I still did not know 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.619
 I have not seen the first episode of this 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.210
 Series team my channel was the video I 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.220
 I can last video I posted just give a 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.980
 Look, there you will find it inside the channel. 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.989
 I then look there for the first episode 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.890
 and if you have seen the first episode and 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.059
 want to see the second 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.430
 come with me so that staff 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.010
 The first time we have what I bit him 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.379
 oxy welliton he owns again 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.660
 some sprites two new things that 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.170
 he put in the word is the face of the 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.420
 female character the work a scam 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.989
 A wave of magic I do not know very well that 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.059
 is 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.920
 and also has the old friend functionalism 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.239
 What about a clown and a sword and I think 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.399
 that the story was very cool these 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.170
 that he placed the 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.240
 which board is to begin to evolve already 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.830
 showed some kind of innovation in this 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.460
 sense 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.710
 then we already had the iwc interface 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.049
 cushion the user interface and the 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.060
 game quests have also been added 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.220
 you can notice that also surprised 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.110
 still this system that I will only leave 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.840
 this episode for you to see it logical 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.840
 So are pixote poisons that this 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.450
 blue screen and has part where the old 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.700
 're talking about also strange TechFlash 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.259
 This part still but if you voted 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.270
 in the last elections, you can see that already 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.030
 It's much better, same better. 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.950
 so there it was right in the middle of the beginnings 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.360
 of this part of the game interface 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.159
 user and day care centers 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.720
 so I was pretty basic or not at all 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.850
 too much 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.520
 So we had the President of the 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.520
 cloud full in cloud are these clouds 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.930
 When you do not come with very cool I 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.090
 I thought it was an interesting addition is 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.600
 keep because you would really be well 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.549
 strange to see, for example, the blue sky without 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.170
 nothing like that is clear there is a day that does not have 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:08.099
 same name but it is not normal and normal is 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.430
 also going here to tell me 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.520
 diction went to space and the damn bike 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.680
 past and making noise 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.550
 on the street and that disturbs me not yield has 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.220
 one thing that annoys me a lot 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.990
 Photographing is me getting out of the way of 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.520
 I'm talking like I did now and when 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.410
 There's a noisy motorcycle on the street. 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.410
 a bag is a bag 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.080
 so like I was saying I found 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.390
 cool these clouds I just thought 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.210
 could have an opacity because the 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.060
 smaller but could be more transparent 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.380
 but it has nothing to complain about this 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.000
 cloud type and such 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.370
 I think I've already made an improvement on it. 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.830
 looks like a large cotton acorn 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.050
 flying and already in the other the prudent we 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.090
 we had the in crises votes i solved 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.920
 so he increased votes 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.510
 to appear graphically much more 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.740
 beautiful than it was then you will see 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.960
 these shocks 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.450
 so it's cuter everything you guys there 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.640
 then we will be able to see Spaniards who already 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.590
 everything seemed more beautiful 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.590
 beautiful beauty, next time 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.480
 now we have actress pride yes guys 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.760
 finally trees on the board tom there already 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.740
 so began to model the biomes that 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.230
 he was already putting in and started cutting the 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.060
 trees that I think I was in a 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.240
 It's really cool, you see that 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.100
 They are all very much the same but I think 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.850
 generates a good lesson for that era of 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.530
 game 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.840
 you do not know this is amazing 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.120
 in 2011 for you to have a sense of 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.310
 how is the game then he was well on 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.900
 state early stage of the game 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.480
 I thought it was cool these trees. 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.670
 because he has already shown that he had what 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.520
 he intended to make a play there then I 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.320
 I 've already been improving it, he even said that 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.610
 the project that seeks the cosan of insomnia 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.230
 him because he did not stop thinking about the 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.910
 who board and just wanted to work on 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.730
 project also a very cool project 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.750
 how I think I should have this 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.750
 all attention 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.120
 the next is what chubby the video 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.290
 turned to hear or read English is very 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.150
 multiplan 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.000
 so in this video he showed us 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.380
 water new animations trees 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.790
 so basically all that you 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.980
 saw in that last surprise that I said 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.390
 You 're in this video so he goes. 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.610
 totally background for you to give a 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.470
 look at this background since the beginning of 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.200
 video not sure back is not 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.700
 because the video is short so I do not know 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.930
 if I leave you now will leave the 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.419
 beginning 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.430
 but then you can notice that you had a 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:29.320
 first a great evolution of the keyboard 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:31.120
 as it was before procwork already of the leça 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.580
 in this part of the game at that stage 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.080
 advanced already so I will not tell this 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.800
 day video as tires because it is just a 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.380
 video 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.910
 so let's go to the last ticket of this 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.949
 video here of second episode of the series 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:45.130
 of all the opinions of what 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:46.930
 bites and network band hall 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.820
 so he had add fragile think 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.580
 For me it was the first montillo that good 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.530
 because the osório they seemed kind of 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.090
 playable at the start so I think it was the 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.550
 first a monster same game that 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:01.030
 taught and was a troll the subject could 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:03.490
 to sell by shorts plus one more 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.120
 than boat to shoot variety for 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.979
 game 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.199
 so the staff were basically those 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.580
 six opponents of today I really 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:11.620
