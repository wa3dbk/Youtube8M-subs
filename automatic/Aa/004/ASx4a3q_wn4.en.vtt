00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:07.620
 hello and today I bring you a very manicure 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.900
 hippie because when the good comes 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.090
 time we like to dress a little 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.010
 more colorful a little more style 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.920
 hippie that takes a little bit this 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.289
 season and if I 'm not sure that all 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.909
 we have a hippie friend to teach her 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.480
 the video that sure is going to them 

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:27.689
 love will need a nail 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.060
 transparent color for the beginning 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.919
 to protect our nails so that 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.890
 then do not get yellow spots 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:37.649
 well a white enamel and a 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.800
 black enamel that is with the 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.489
 brush that has the fine tip is worth and a 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.809
 stick to help us make the design 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.960
 and colored enamels 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.899
 I'm going to use a blue one red and one 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.489
 green but you can catch the colors that 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.170
 you like 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.660
 we started by giving a layer of enamel 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.809
 transparent on our nails and when 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.449
 is well dry we will give one or two layers 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.780
 of white enamel and we will leave 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.630
 dry very well 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.610
 the next step will be to make some 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.420
 stripes with the colors that we have 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.369
 chosen I have made three strips 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.659
 horizontal one of each color in red 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.509
 blue and green 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.659
 you can do them vertically or in 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.520
 diagonal as you want is worth and does not 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.130
 missing that are perfect lines 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.460
 they can be some finer others more 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.670
 thick and the lines between one and the other do not 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.619
 they need to be very well defined 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.590
 always try to leave a few holes 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.690
 whites between color and color and now 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.540
 let dry very well 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.600
 now with the black enamel and the 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.600
 We will limit the fine point brush 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.600
 watch the lines that are between 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.510
 Color and color it have to have a 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.330
 little bit of pulse nothing is very easy with 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:04.660
 very careful and sometimes it 's better to turn 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.420
 the nail that the brush rotates is worth a 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.640
 Good trick, that's why I told you 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.980
 that there was no need for the lines between 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.630
 color and color were totally 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:15.430
 perfect because now with the line of 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.010
 black color we're going 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.890
 reviewing and retouching 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.200
 now with the black enamel the 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.810
 fine point brush and the help of a 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.720
 stick we will be doing the different 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:33.280
 hippies cartoons that we like some 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:36.590
 dashes are the dots a few triangles 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.930
 what we want what happens to us 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.500
 happen to us or what we carry in the 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:45.260
 dress so that we set good for 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.620
 finish we would have to eliminate all 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.859
 the faults around in our skin 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.100
 and give one or two layers of enamel 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:56.520
 transparent 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:03:00.480
 and so we would have our coolest 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.700
 hippie manicure good as you can see 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.260
 do all the designs that we are 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.290
 it happen 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:11.630
 I hope you put it into practice and that 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.630
 I liked you goodbye
