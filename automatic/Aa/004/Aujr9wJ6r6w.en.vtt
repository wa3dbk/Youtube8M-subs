10 volumes so I just hope that I think
more<00:03:10.180> than<00:03:10.240> the<00:03:10.690> hard<00:03:10.990> core<00:03:11.710> political

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
more than the hard core political

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.790 
more than the hard core political
parties<00:03:12.970> and<00:03:13.360> people<00:03:13.570> who<00:03:13.870> discuss<00:03:14.290> politics

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
parties and people who discuss politics

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.830 
parties and people who discuss politics
it's<00:03:15.070> very<00:03:15.430> very<00:03:15.820> very<00:03:16.060> important<00:03:16.570> for<00:03:16.750> the

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
it's very very very important for the

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.870 
it's very very very important for the
younger<00:03:17.350> generation<00:03:17.980> to<00:03:18.010> be<00:03:18.250> involved<00:03:18.760> and

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
younger generation to be involved and

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.910 
younger generation to be involved and
the<00:03:19.360> only<00:03:19.540> way<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:19.989> younger<00:03:20.260> generation<00:03:20.800> can

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
the only way the younger generation can

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.220 
the only way the younger generation can
be<00:03:20.980> involved<00:03:21.340> is<00:03:21.610> if<00:03:21.790> they<00:03:21.910> go<00:03:22.060> vote<00:03:22.300> so<00:03:23.200> I

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
be involved is if they go vote so I

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.300 
be involved is if they go vote so I
think<00:03:23.440> if<00:03:23.920> you<00:03:24.280> take<00:03:24.489> the<00:03:24.610> responsibility<00:03:25.540> of

think if you take the responsibility of
going<00:03:27.310> and<00:03:27.489> voting<00:03:27.880> you<00:03:28.480> are<00:03:28.660> doing<00:03:28.959> a<00:03:29.170> lot<00:03:29.890> for

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.190 
future of your country so a lot of the
youth<00:03:39.459> today<00:03:39.730> feel<00:03:40.030> gay<00:03:40.270> you<00:03:40.690> know<00:03:40.720> I<00:03:40.870> don't

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
youth today feel gay you know I don't

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.330 
youth today feel gay you know I don't
like<00:03:41.380> this<00:03:41.560> so<00:03:41.800> I<00:03:41.830> don't<00:03:42.070> like<00:03:42.190> this

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
like this so I don't like this

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.770 
like this so I don't like this
politician<00:03:42.850> and<00:03:43.000> they<00:03:43.090> don't<00:03:43.300> go<00:03:43.450> and<00:03:43.570> vote

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
politician and they don't go and vote

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.949 
politician and they don't go and vote
but<00:03:44.650> it's<00:03:44.920> that<00:03:45.489> that<00:03:45.670> not<00:03:46.030> going<00:03:46.390> and<00:03:46.600> voting

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
but it's that that not going and voting

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.590 
but it's that that not going and voting
hurts<00:03:47.739> the<00:03:48.010> next<00:03:48.280> five<00:03:48.520> years<00:03:48.820> for<00:03:49.150> all<00:03:49.420> our

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
hurts the next five years for all our

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.720 
hurts the next five years for all our
futures<00:03:49.989> so<00:03:50.680> I<00:03:50.709> think<00:03:50.890> it's<00:03:51.220> very<00:03:51.520> very

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
futures so I think it's very very

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.490 
futures so I think it's very very
important<00:03:52.239> for<00:03:52.360> people<00:03:52.420> a<00:03:52.840> to<00:03:52.900> go<00:03:53.200> and<00:03:53.350> vote

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
important for people a to go and vote

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.560 
important for people a to go and vote
and<00:03:53.800> I<00:03:54.370> think<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:55.810> color<00:03:56.110> of<00:03:56.560> a<00:03:57.520> blood<00:03:58.209> is<00:03:58.420> the

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
and I think the color of a blood is the

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.110 
and I think the color of a blood is the
same<00:03:58.600> so<00:03:59.290> it<00:03:59.440> doesn't<00:03:59.860> matter<00:04:00.040> what<00:04:00.910> religion

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
same so it doesn't matter what religion

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.699 
same so it doesn't matter what religion
you<00:04:01.480> are<00:04:01.780> or<00:04:01.989> where<00:04:02.170> you<00:04:02.320> from

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
you are or where you from

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.620 
you are or where you from
people<00:04:03.250> always<00:04:03.520> blend<00:04:04.120> better<00:04:04.330> than

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
people always blend better than

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.620 
people always blend better than
governments<00:04:05.230> so<00:04:05.920> I<00:04:05.950> think<00:04:06.550> if<00:04:06.940> that<00:04:06.970> can<00:04:07.600> be

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
governments so I think if that can be

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.990 
governments so I think if that can be
taken<00:04:07.930> care<00:04:08.230> of<00:04:08.290> India<00:04:09.160> there's<00:04:09.430> no<00:04:09.580> stopping

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
taken care of India there's no stopping

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.070 
taken care of India there's no stopping
