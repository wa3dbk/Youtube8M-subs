00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.880
 strict printers like this and inside with such 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.660
 accuracy that allows you to print 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.039
 on paper text graphics and pictures 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:14.919
 how upset 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:16.919
 remarkable but worth 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:19.919
 you were threatened 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.430
 what bogdanchikov 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.080
 they say to tighten 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.370
 but one of the roles 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.370
 cartridges one more 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.500
 know the print head it consists 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.500
 of water 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.320
 me and print head jazz 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.310
 this is how the editor works for two more 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.660
 parts 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.450
 into this information calling 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.000
 his task is to 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.800
 coordinate work 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.280
 1 studying singing heads 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.670
 project by yourself 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.570
 if you have a dye chemical 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.570
 substances that do not allow alas sunset 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.720
 m by themselves mob 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.410
 is quite expensive 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.410
 no 30 times more expensive than champagne 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.790
 this printer model is black 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.630
 cartridge contains 10 0 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.180
 Salyutny cartridges contains four with 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.850
 by half 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.370
 and did not reach iturup 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.060
 on paper 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.060
 later prosecutor's office 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.050
 but these six rows can be obtained 16 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.050
 million flowers 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.560
 not a single cartridge will save 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.270
 will be football 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.390
 Leonov tile 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.700
 enough to print 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.980
 dry 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.489
 stopped it all working 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.489
 but played four small motor 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:16.889
 her paper feed author 

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:21.179
 push roller 

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:24.729
 third and is now 2 more 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:31.109
 and this is noted in the message 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:32.929
 thanks to these four 

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:34.869
 printer disease works as one 

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:36.159
 whole 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.159
 but it can only be estimated when the prime 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:43.419
 printhead made 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:47.359
 it consists of three thousand hryvnia 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:50.359
 tiny sun 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.799
 in which 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.789
 for each color than intended 

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:57.939
 fifty gardens 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:02:59.680
 every 100 payment only for one 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.029
 colors 

00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:04.099
 52 seems to punish 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:05.569
 Greek pack warms up 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.049
 tiny 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.509
 which temperature data is black 

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:12.679
 in this world, the secretary general of the alliance 

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:15.679
 but evaporation base laws 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:19.869
 is different 

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:22.869
 new batch ink coming in quarter 

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:27.989
 and this happens will play 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.370
 every word increased in one second 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.370
 we face 24 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.719
 future with black ink this figure 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:39.979
 reaches thirty six thousand kilometers 

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:42.979
 speed in this case 

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:45.679
 every drop of ink should be repelled 

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:47.329
 at the right moment 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.329
 attention appeared in the text picture 

00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:53.179
 burn aisle printhead from 

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:54.449
 land 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:56.439
 eyes in one direction 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:57.649
 further to the evening 

00:03:57.649 --> 00:04:00.649
 exactly hit the mark 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:05.090
 but it's all right 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.169
 organization process 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:09.109
 it is surprising that suddenly ordinary 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:10.709
 office printers can suddenly 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.699
 turn into something interesting 

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:15.789
 just imagine 3900 tiny people 

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:21.620
 go tanks haves on their paper 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.330
 desktop printer really
