00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.660
 Dad! 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.900
 It's over? 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.900
 Finally. No king rules forever, my son. 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:45.000
 I only see the darkness, before me. 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.600
 Without the command of his master, 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.000
 the tireless Scourge will become an even greater threat to this world. 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.790
 The control should be maintained. There must always be, 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.000
 a King Lich. 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.000
 This excessive weight should be mine, 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.500
 because there is no other ... 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.200
 Tirion! 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.750
 You hold a terrible fate in your hands, brother, 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.200
 but it's not for you. 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.200
 Bolvar! 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.500
 For all that is most sacred ... 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.200
 The flame of the dragons decided my fate. 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.700
 The world of the living can no longer comfort me. 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.300
 Please put the crown over my head, Tirion. 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.500
 Forever I will be the jailer of the damned. 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:29.900
 No, old friend, 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.500
 I can not... 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.000
 Do it, Tirion! 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.890
 You and your brave heroes have their own destiny to fulfill. 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.900
 This last act of service, 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.900
 it's mine. 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.970
 You will not be forgotten, brother. 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.140
 I need to be forgotten, Tirion! 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.600
 If it is for this world to live free from tyranny and fear, 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.000
 they should never know what was done here today. 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.800
 Just say that the King Lich is dead, 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.600
 and that Bolvar Fordragon, died with him. 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.550
 Now go! Leave this place, and never return. 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.500
