00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.220
 need to 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:26.309
 hedgehogs lead mainly 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:29.309
 solitary nocturnal life though 

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:33.180
 occasionally active in the morning 

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:42.540
 night away they are busy but the form itself 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:50.269
 during the day they rest and sleep how useful 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:58.100

 asia and africa desert hedgehogs ears a little 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.899
 longer 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:15.720
 and needles are shorter everywhere, that's why 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:16.460
 lives everywhere and tastes laziness and in the mountains and in 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.500
 joplin 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.530
 without fresh nowhere 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.729
 special mission hedgehogs are common 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.670
 everywhere 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.670
 oh they are not only in australia 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:36.020

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:58.310

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:59.270
 nonsense I turn from words to deeds this is what 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:13.070
 such 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:16.840

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:20.980

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:25.090
 a hedgehog now would run his australia 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:28.810
 a certain crocodile would come up 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:32.760
 why am I not in my crib now 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:55.659

 why am I not still young and full of energy 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:49.420
 easy to lift for the soul 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:04:08.050
 Australia can be dangerous for hedgehogs 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:04:25.100
 so they are there and do not eat I'll become a horse 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:28.100
