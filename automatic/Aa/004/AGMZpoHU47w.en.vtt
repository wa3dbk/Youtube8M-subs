00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
forecast for gold and silver in a little

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.960 
forecast for gold and silver in a little
bit<00:00:16.800> so<00:00:16.949> everyone<00:00:17.190> will<00:00:17.310> have<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.609> stay<00:00:17.760> tuned

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
bit so everyone will have to stay tuned

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.929 
bit so everyone will have to stay tuned
to<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.359> end<00:00:18.480> but<00:00:18.690> first<00:00:18.930> let's<00:00:19.170> talk<00:00:19.350> about

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
to the end but first let's talk about

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.609 
to the end but first let's talk about
e-scrap<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.180> really<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.810> important<00:00:22.289> role<00:00:22.439> it

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
e-scrap and really the important role it

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.189 
e-scrap and really the important role it
plays<00:00:22.830> when<00:00:23.039> we're<00:00:23.189> talking<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.850> metals<00:00:24.199> yes

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
plays when we're talking the metals yes

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.279 
plays when we're talking the metals yes
so<00:00:25.460> over<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.609> past<00:00:26.820> few<00:00:27.180> decades<00:00:27.359> the

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
so over the past few decades the

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.230 
so over the past few decades the
generation<00:00:28.769> of<00:00:28.830> East<00:00:29.010> crap<00:00:29.189> has<00:00:29.429> increased<00:00:30.000> at

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
generation of East crap has increased at

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.840 
generation of East crap has increased at
a<00:00:30.300> double-digit<00:00:30.810> pace<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.730> what<00:00:32.730> we're

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
a double-digit pace and what we're

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.600 
a double-digit pace and what we're
seeing<00:00:33.030> now<00:00:33.180> is<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.290> recycling<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:35.040> the

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
seeing now is that the recycling of the

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.490 
seeing now is that the recycling of the
East<00:00:36.120> crap<00:00:36.300> that's<00:00:36.480> being<00:00:36.630> generated<00:00:37.140> is

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
East crap that's being generated is

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.619 
East crap that's being generated is
increasing<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.340> so<00:00:39.120> it's<00:00:39.210> becoming<00:00:39.450> an

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
increasing and so it's becoming an

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.869 
increasing and so it's becoming an
increasingly<00:00:40.410> more<00:00:40.649> important<00:00:41.309> source<00:00:41.700> of

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
increasingly more important source of

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.240 
increasingly more important source of
feedstock<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.750> recyclers<00:00:43.200> especially<00:00:44.160> in

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
feedstock to recyclers especially in

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.330 
feedstock to recyclers especially in
this<00:00:44.340> market<00:00:44.399> environment<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.329> weaker<00:00:45.629> prices

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
this market environment of weaker prices

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.580 
this market environment of weaker prices
recyclers<00:00:47.340> are<00:00:47.520> looking<00:00:48.000> for<00:00:48.719> for<00:00:49.379> new

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
recyclers are looking for for new

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.200 
recyclers are looking for for new
sources<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.660> scrap<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:53.210> relatively

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
sources and a scrap is a relatively

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.510 
sources and a scrap is a relatively
untapped<00:00:54.809> market<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:55.710> where<00:00:55.949> are<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.309> biggest

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
untapped market so where are the biggest

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.720 
untapped market so where are the biggest
markets<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.870> biggest<00:00:58.170> market<00:00:58.579> country<00:00:59.579> wise

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
markets the biggest market country wise

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.139 
markets the biggest market country wise
is<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.149> US<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:01.670> region<00:01:02.670> wives<00:01:02.820> would<00:01:03.030> be

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
is the US and region wives would be

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.230 
is the US and region wives would be
Western<00:01:03.660> Europe<00:01:03.930> actually<00:01:04.489> after<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.640> china

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
Western Europe actually after that china

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.210 
Western Europe actually after that china
is<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.420> very<00:01:06.600> large<00:01:06.780> generator<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.619> east<00:01:07.920> scrap

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
is a very large generator of east scrap

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.789 
is a very large generator of east scrap
and<00:01:08.990> Japan<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.110> pretty<00:01:10.320> stick<00:01:10.500> with<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.650> as

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
and Japan is pretty stick with it as

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.289 
and Japan is pretty stick with it as
well<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.250> what<00:01:11.430> would<00:01:11.549> need<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.760> happen<00:01:11.850> in

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
well so what would need to happen in

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.550 
well so what would need to happen in
order<00:01:12.390> for<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.750> scrap<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.049> play<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.229> bigger

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
order for you scrap to play a bigger

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.800 
order for you scrap to play a bigger
role<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.580> market<00:01:14.909> so<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.659> biggest

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
role in the market so the biggest

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.840 
role in the market so the biggest
bottleneck<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.770> industry<00:01:17.189> right<00:01:17.369> now<00:01:17.400> is

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
bottleneck in the industry right now is

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.539 
bottleneck in the industry right now is
at<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.900> collection<00:01:19.200> level<00:01:19.619> the

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
at the collection level the

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.850 
at the collection level the
infrastructure<00:01:21.150> for<00:01:21.720> collecting<00:01:22.409> everything

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
infrastructure for collecting everything

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.850 
infrastructure for collecting everything
that's<00:01:23.070> generated<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.790> just<00:01:24.240> not<00:01:24.420> quite<00:01:24.659> there

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
that's generated is just not quite there

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.440 
that's generated is just not quite there
particularly<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:26.040> emerging<00:01:26.280> markets<00:01:26.790> but

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
particularly in emerging markets but

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.789 
particularly in emerging markets but
even<00:01:27.720> in<00:01:27.990> us<00:01:28.590> in<00:01:28.979> Western<00:01:29.640> Europe<00:01:30.439> in<00:01:31.439> all<00:01:31.680> the

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
even in us in Western Europe in all the

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.190 
even in us in Western Europe in all the
developed<00:01:32.130> countries<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:32.700> really<00:01:33.570> increasing

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
developed countries so really increasing

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.649 
developed countries so really increasing
getting<00:01:34.860> more<00:01:35.040> collectors<00:01:35.460> out<00:01:35.640> there<00:01:35.700> in<00:01:36.270> the

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
getting more collectors out there in the

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.020 
getting more collectors out there in the
market<00:01:37.369> boosting<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.520> awareness<00:01:38.729> of

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
market boosting the awareness of

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.109 
market boosting the awareness of
take-back<00:01:39.450> programs<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.579> consumers<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:41.700> it's

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
take-back programs to consumers so it's

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.090 
take-back programs to consumers so it's
really<00:01:42.270> hard<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.600> get<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:43.649> know<00:01:43.680> an

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
really hard to get you know an

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.069 
really hard to get you know an
individual<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.880> return<00:01:45.240> there's<00:01:45.509> there<00:01:45.930> you

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
individual to return there's there you

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.200 
individual to return there's there you
think<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.530> could<00:01:46.710> become<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.340> significant

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
think it could become a significant

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.929 
think it could become a significant
source<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.990> supply<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.619> market<00:01:49.979> yeah<00:01:50.729> so

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
source of supply to the market yeah so

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.440 
source of supply to the market yeah so
if<00:01:51.090> we<00:01:51.210> can<00:01:51.360> increase<00:01:52.399> collection<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.970> scrap

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
if we can increase collection of a scrap

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.789 
if we can increase collection of a scrap
that<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.689> generated<00:01:55.079> every<00:01:55.170> year<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.500> think<00:01:55.619> it

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
that is generated every year I think it

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.980 
that is generated every year I think it
could<00:01:56.009> be<00:01:56.189> more<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.640> more<00:01:56.729> important<00:01:57.149> right

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
could be more and more important right

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.200 
could be more and more important right
now<00:01:58.049> I've<00:01:58.469> estimated<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.159> East<00:01:59.909> grab

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
now I've estimated that East grab

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.910 
now I've estimated that East grab
accounts<00:02:00.659> for<00:02:00.750> about<00:02:00.869> two<00:02:01.229> percent<00:02:01.439> of

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
accounts for about two percent of

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.280 
accounts for about two percent of
precious<00:02:02.549> metals<00:02:02.850> scrap<00:02:03.299> supply<00:02:03.689> every<00:02:04.020> year

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
precious metals scrap supply every year

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.620 
precious metals scrap supply every year
so<00:02:05.219> that<00:02:05.369> could<00:02:05.460> easily<00:02:05.700> be<00:02:05.939> boosted<00:02:06.329> up<00:02:06.420> to

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
so that could easily be boosted up to

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.270 
so that could easily be boosted up to
around<00:02:06.840> 10<00:02:07.140> Erika<00:02:07.649> do<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:07.829> think<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.039> also<00:02:08.160> has

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
around 10 Erika do you think it also has

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.650 
around 10 Erika do you think it also has
to<00:02:08.340> do<00:02:08.489> with<00:02:08.610> just<00:02:08.879> public<00:02:09.179> awareness<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.539> mean

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
to do with just public awareness I mean

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.729 
to do with just public awareness I mean
how<00:02:09.780> many<00:02:09.840> people<00:02:09.959> actually<00:02:10.349> know<00:02:10.709> that

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
how many people actually know that

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.580 
how many people actually know that
there's<00:02:11.099> you<00:02:11.760> know<00:02:11.790> metal<00:02:12.180> in<00:02:12.330> their<00:02:12.510> iphone

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
there's you know metal in their iphone

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.530 
there's you know metal in their iphone
honestly<00:02:13.950> what<00:02:14.160> you're<00:02:14.310> trying<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.120> do<00:02:15.330> or

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
honestly what you're trying to do or

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.270 
honestly what you're trying to do or
achieve<00:02:15.840> is<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.319> get<00:02:16.650> them<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:16.830> just<00:02:17.129> return

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
achieve is to get them to just return

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.339 
achieve is to get them to just return
their<00:02:18.000> old<00:02:18.180> phones<00:02:18.420> when<00:02:18.690> they<00:02:18.780> get<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:18.959> new<00:02:19.019> one

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
their old phones when they get a new one

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:20.900 
their old phones when they get a new one
and<00:02:19.620> that's<00:02:20.040> what<00:02:20.220> they're<00:02:20.370> not<00:02:20.459> doing<00:02:20.519> that

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
and that's what they're not doing that

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.500 
and that's what they're not doing that
so<00:02:21.900> in<00:02:22.200> terms<00:02:22.319> of<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.650> value<00:02:23.300> it's<00:02:24.300> the

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
so in terms of the value it's the

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.970 
so in terms of the value it's the
collectors<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:25.050> want<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.410> kind<00:02:25.680> of<00:02:25.709> boost

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
collectors you want to kind of boost

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.860 
collectors you want to kind of boost
that<00:02:26.310> kind<00:02:26.640> of<00:02:26.700> knowledge<00:02:28.069> to<00:02:29.069> get<00:02:29.220> people<00:02:29.580> to

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
that kind of knowledge to get people to

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.220 
that kind of knowledge to get people to
actually<00:02:30.870> collect<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.440> material<00:02:32.430> that<00:02:32.459> is<00:02:32.790> is

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
actually collect the material that is is

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.630 
actually collect the material that is is
sitting<00:02:34.230> around<00:02:34.349> in<00:02:34.560> attics<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.129> all<00:02:35.459> right

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
sitting around in attics and all right

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.190 
sitting around in attics and all right
Erica<00:02:35.940> let's<00:02:36.120> talk<00:02:36.330> gold<00:02:36.959> and<00:02:37.110> silver

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
Erica let's talk gold and silver

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.710 
Erica let's talk gold and silver
forecast<00:02:38.099> now<00:02:38.340> is<00:02:38.670> erica<00:02:39.299> rawness<00:02:39.569> that

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
forecast now is erica rawness that

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.570 
forecast now is erica rawness that
bullish<00:02:40.140> or<00:02:40.319> bearish<00:02:40.620> on<00:02:40.950> these<00:02:41.160> two<00:02:41.310> metals

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
bullish or bearish on these two metals

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.240 
bullish or bearish on these two metals
well<00:02:42.360> unfortunately<00:02:42.540> I'm<00:02:43.019> still<00:02:43.620> bearish<00:02:43.950> and

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
well unfortunately I'm still bearish and

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.220 
well unfortunately I'm still bearish and
I<00:02:44.790> think<00:02:45.120> over<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.360> next<00:02:45.450> few<00:02:45.780> months<00:02:45.930> we

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
I think over the next few months we

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.020 
I think over the next few months we
we've<00:02:46.650> kind<00:02:46.860> of<00:02:46.890> entered<00:02:47.130> into<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.489> the

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
we've kind of entered into the the

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.400 
we've kind of entered into the the
summer<00:02:48.269> months<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:48.959> Western<00:02:49.380> Hemisphere

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
summer months and the Western Hemisphere

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.180 
summer months and the Western Hemisphere
so<00:02:50.220> that<00:02:50.730> does<00:02:50.940> lend<00:02:51.269> itself<00:02:51.360> to<00:02:51.599> a<00:02:51.720> little<00:02:51.959> bit

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
so that does lend itself to a little bit

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.039 
so that does lend itself to a little bit
less<00:02:53.190> activity<00:02:53.489> in<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.819> market<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:54.360> little<00:02:54.959> bit

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
less activity in the market a little bit

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.710 
less activity in the market a little bit
less<00:02:55.170> interest<00:02:55.650> but<00:02:56.040> so<00:02:57.000> I<00:02:57.030> do<00:02:57.150> expect<00:02:57.390> prices

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
less interest but so I do expect prices

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.690 
less interest but so I do expect prices
to<00:02:57.870> come<00:02:58.170> off<00:02:58.319> a<00:02:58.349> little<00:02:58.560> bit<00:02:58.920> but<00:02:59.190> I<00:02:59.400> think

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
to come off a little bit but I think

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.830 
to come off a little bit but I think
that<00:02:59.730> could<00:02:59.879> be<00:02:59.940> really<00:03:00.120> positive<00:03:00.360> for

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
that could be really positive for

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.289 
that could be really positive for
physical<00:03:01.290> offtake<00:03:01.739> investors<00:03:02.489> are<00:03:02.760> still

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
physical offtake investors are still

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:04.940 
physical offtake investors are still
looking<00:03:03.390> for<00:03:03.569> bargain<00:03:03.959> opportunities<00:03:04.560> so

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
looking for bargain opportunities so

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.979 
looking for bargain opportunities so
with<00:03:05.849> that<00:03:05.970> in<00:03:06.090> mind<00:03:06.120> I<00:03:06.360> think<00:03:06.510> that<00:03:06.629> prices

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
with that in mind I think that prices

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.339 
with that in mind I think that prices
could<00:03:07.200> be<00:03:07.379> stemmed<00:03:07.769> or<00:03:08.640> limited<00:03:09.120> I<00:03:09.480> do<00:03:09.989> think

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
could be stemmed or limited I do think

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.400 
could be stemmed or limited I do think
that<00:03:10.470> gold<00:03:10.950> will<00:03:11.220> remain<00:03:11.610> above<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.660> one

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
that gold will remain above the one

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.740 
that gold will remain above the one
thousand<00:03:13.799> dollar<00:03:13.920> level<00:03:14.129> and<00:03:14.610> even<00:03:15.090> the

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
thousand dollar level and even the

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.479 
thousand dollar level and even the
eleven<00:03:16.049> hundred<00:03:16.140> dollar<00:03:16.470> level<00:03:16.709> I<00:03:16.860> think<00:03:16.890> is<00:03:17.129> a

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
eleven hundred dollar level I think is a

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.809 
eleven hundred dollar level I think is a
good<00:03:17.700> point<00:03:18.350> linen<00:03:19.350> so<00:03:19.590> among<00:03:19.859> the<00:03:19.980> precious

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
good point linen so among the precious

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.430 
good point linen so among the precious
metals<00:03:21.239> Erica<00:03:21.660> which<00:03:21.810> one<00:03:21.959> would<00:03:22.049> you<00:03:22.109> say<00:03:22.319> has

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
metals Erica which one would you say has

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.309 
metals Erica which one would you say has
the<00:03:22.590> best<00:03:22.850> fundamental<00:03:23.850> stories<00:03:24.150> it's<00:03:25.139> still

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
the best fundamental stories it's still

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.039 
the best fundamental stories it's still
play<00:03:25.650> diem<00:03:26.030> yeah<00:03:27.030> ring<00:03:27.450> across<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.840> board

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
play diem yeah ring across the board

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.530 
play diem yeah ring across the board
yeah<00:03:28.350> yeah<00:03:28.889> it's<00:03:29.099> a<00:03:29.280> palladium<00:03:30.000> you<00:03:30.269> know

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
yeah yeah it's a palladium you know

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
yeah yeah it's a palladium you know
still<00:03:30.780> is<00:03:30.900> pretty<00:03:31.109> strong<00:03:31.349> fundamentals

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
still is pretty strong fundamentals

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.160 
still is pretty strong fundamentals
because<00:03:32.000> you<00:03:33.000> got<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.180> demand<00:03:33.599> profile<00:03:33.989> is

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
because you got the demand profile is

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.920 
because you got the demand profile is
really<00:03:34.590> really<00:03:34.799> strong<00:03:35.130> and<00:03:35.940> there's<00:03:36.599> a<00:03:36.720> lot

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
really really strong and there's a lot

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.559 
really really strong and there's a lot
of<00:03:36.959> risk<00:03:37.829> embedded<00:03:38.400> in<00:03:38.519> the<00:03:38.609> supply<00:03:38.910> side<00:03:39.150> so
