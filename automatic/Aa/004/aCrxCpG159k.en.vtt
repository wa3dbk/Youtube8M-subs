00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:28.750
 simple and elegant good we are going to 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.130
 start presenting the ingredients of 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.940
 agreement here we have 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.100
 the lettuce the chive mango for 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.989
 decorate the old wine of pedro jiménez 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.239
 with the sugar that will be used to make 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.489
 the sauce and then we have the fruits 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.190
 dry which we will use to 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:50.949
 make a land the cashews that 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.970
 would be these here pistachios almonds 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.580
 hazelnuts 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.070
 and kikos and to finish that is the touch 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.880
 warm of the salad would be the liver 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.880
 fatty of foie gras 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.830
 well let's do the first step 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.820
 is the sauce of this salad that is the 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.850
 that will accompany the foie gras 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.820
 we will take the sugar we will put it in a 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.770
 pan along with what wine is the 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.140
 old wine by pedro jiménez we put it 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.780
 all together in cold because well the sugar 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.759
 as it goes it gets warmer going 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.680
 taking point together with the wine and we 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.440
 is giving density to the sauce good 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.399
 we have to be reducing 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.250
 we will wait for you to take the desired point 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:36.340
 and we are going to do what is the land of 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:40.800
 nuts we take nuts and 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:43.820
 we are incorporating them into the American glass 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.820
 to crush them 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.050
 the sauce aside and we 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.330
 cool a little in a pot for 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.560
 remove it from the pan and also cut the 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.420
 cooking because if we leave it in a 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.310
 frying pan would not continue to reduce and 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.410
 could get to burn good we have already 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.410
 ready this this land of nuts 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.980
 this we would have it as you see it is 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.360
 quite rich in flavors the foie gras what 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.450
 let's cook without any kind of 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.680
 oil or fat element lasarte in this 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.019
 case has to be very very very 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.599
 hot to be able to seal well 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.519
 layers of foie gras and do not lose 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.910
 neither an excess of fat are we going to put 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.910
 the foie gras 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.010
 As you can see, it starts to loosen and release everything 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.430
 what is the fat that I have told you 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.430
 before 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.700
 and we turn it over so that we do not 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.700
 burn 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.040
 and we remove it from the fire 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.080
 so that it will finish resting and with the heat 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.620
 residual is finished cooking we had 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.890
 to a blotting paper to remove the 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.900
 excess fat and whoever runs out of 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.760
 temper, let's start plating 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.440
 this dish agree the first step 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.450
 would be to take the land of nuts 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.310
 this we have done before and we make a 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.230
 base 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.180
 in which we will put the foie gras on top 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.500
 the foie gras that we have here as you see 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.470
 what I have told you we have left 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:19.170
 on paper resting and has released us the 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:22.080
 excess fat that I 've told you before 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.569
 we put a little salt a few touches of 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.970
 mango to the foie gras takes very well the 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.349
 fresh sweet elements then 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.269
 we have put this handle for 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:33.300
 degrease this foie gras will come 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:36.000
 very good agreement we have here a little 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:39.530
 of escarole canons arugula and what I 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.530
 rosol align with a little salt 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.010
 a little trickle 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.599
 of modera reduction 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.019
 and a little virgin olive oil 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.019
 extra 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.129
 we remove it well 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.959
 and we place it 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.120
 giving it some volume so that 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:04.019
 I arrived 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:07.379
 to the table with a lot of agreement 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:10.220
 let's make the last step that would be 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:12.350
 saute the foie gras 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.840
 with candy wine that pedroche 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.120
 we have done before as you see what I have 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.260
 commented is a candy and this touch 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.870
 sweet that brings 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.790
 from defatting to the garage as we have 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.870
 commented before we will finish it with a 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.870
 little chive on top 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.200
 well this would be our warm salad 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.970
 of foie gras and I hope that I have 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.970
 liked and I encourage you to do it at home
