00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:26.759

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
would go through the whole foam rolling

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.430 
would go through the whole foam rolling
sequence<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.180> had<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.480> video<00:00:33.720> to<00:00:33.930> refer<00:00:34.410> to

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
rolling is just as important as

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.709

stretching<00:00:38.250> it's<00:00:38.670> just<00:00:39.000> as<00:00:39.090> important<00:00:39.660> as

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
stretching it's just as important as

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.569 
stretching it's just as important as
doing<00:00:39.750> your<00:00:40.020> exercises<00:00:40.829> because<00:00:41.370> if<00:00:41.489> you

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
doing your exercises because if you

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.920 
doing your exercises because if you
don't<00:00:41.760> loosen<00:00:42.149> up<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.420> knots<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.780> your

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
don't loosen up the knots and your

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.930 
don't loosen up the knots and your
muscles<00:00:43.350> you'll<00:00:44.039> never<00:00:44.219> be<00:00:44.399> able<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.670> stretch

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
muscles you'll never be able to stretch

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.810
