00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
at this which looks to me like it's some

nice adidas flip flops or something see
him<00:00:59.340> here<00:00:59.570> see<00:01:00.570> how<00:01:00.780> smooth<00:01:01.620> they<00:01:02.100> are<00:01:03.680> very

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
him here see how smooth they are very

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.590 
him here see how smooth they are very
smooth<00:01:05.070> let's<00:01:05.580> see<00:01:05.729> if<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:05.939> can<00:01:06.060> sharpen<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.510> up

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
smooth let's see if we can sharpen it up

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.170 
smooth let's see if we can sharpen it up
just<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.930> tad<00:01:07.280> maybe<00:01:08.280> make<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.670> stand<00:01:08.939> out<00:01:09.119> a

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
just a tad maybe make it stand out a

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.880 
just a tad maybe make it stand out a
little<00:01:09.330> bit

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.690 

just<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.640> little<00:01:14.909> bit<00:01:15.290> but<00:01:16.290> let's<00:01:17.190> take<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.370> look

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
just a little bit but let's take a look

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.460 
just a little bit but let's take a look
at<00:01:17.790> this<00:01:17.970> picture<00:01:18.300> just<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:18.840> general<00:01:19.050> here

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
at this picture just in general here

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.990 
at this picture just in general here
because<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.979> shapes<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:20.940> looks<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.420> be<00:01:21.600> a

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
because the shapes this looks to be a

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.270 
because the shapes this looks to be a
area<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.300> used<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.750> be<00:01:24.900> something<00:01:25.290> along<00:01:26.100> the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
area that used to be something along the

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.020 
area that used to be something along the
lines<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.940> a<00:01:27.150> structure<00:01:28.580> maybe<00:01:29.580> something

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
lines of a structure maybe something

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.570 
lines of a structure maybe something
that<00:01:30.210> was<00:01:30.420> built<00:01:31.070> maybe<00:01:32.070> some<00:01:32.250> sort<00:01:32.490> of

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
that was built maybe some sort of

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.609 
that was built maybe some sort of
functional<00:01:33.150> structure<00:01:33.479> who<00:01:33.869> knows<00:01:34.140> but<00:01:34.440> this

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
functional structure who knows but this

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:35.920 
functional structure who knows but this
place<00:01:34.830> looks<00:01:35.070> like<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.340> was<00:01:35.430> thrashed

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
place looks like it was thrashed

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.140 
place looks like it was thrashed
thrashed<00:01:36.930> by<00:01:37.170> something<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:38.460> let's<00:01:38.880> start<00:01:39.060> off

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
thrashed by something so let's start off

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.730 
thrashed by something so let's start off
with<00:01:39.180> here<00:01:39.570> let's<00:01:39.869> take<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.050> look<00:01:40.200> here<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.619> we

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
with here let's take a look here so we

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.620 
with here let's take a look here so we
saw<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:40.950> down<00:01:41.369> there<00:01:41.550> of<00:01:41.670> course<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.119> saw

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
saw that down there of course you saw

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.690 
saw that down there of course you saw
this<00:01:43.009> that's<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.070> different<00:01:44.400> angle<00:01:44.670> than

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
this that's a different angle than

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.790 
this that's a different angle than
before<00:01:44.970> too<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:45.810> if<00:01:46.050> you<00:01:46.200> want<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.440> see<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.680> on

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
before too so if you want to see it on

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.499 
before too so if you want to see it on
this<00:01:46.920> angle<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.460> still<00:01:47.729> looks<00:01:47.940> exactly<00:01:48.300> like

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
this angle it still looks exactly like

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.840 
this angle it still looks exactly like
it<00:01:48.810> was<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.320> you've<00:01:50.009> got<00:01:50.160> your<00:01:50.340> flip-flop

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
it was and you've got your flip-flop

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.710 
it was and you've got your flip-flop
here<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:52.490> to<00:01:53.490> me<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:53.880> looks<00:01:53.940> like<00:01:54.330> this<00:01:54.509> was

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
here and to me this looks like this was

actually see the carving right there the
circle<00:04:59.560> this<00:05:00.190> is<00:05:00.430> flattened<00:05:00.970> out<00:05:01.150> this<00:05:01.570> looks

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810

coming there looks like candy cane now
tell<00:05:12.850> me<00:05:12.880> that's<00:05:13.210> proof<00:05:13.600> that<00:05:14.139> is<00:05:14.410> Mars<00:05:14.820> unless

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
tell me that's proof that is Mars unless

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.730 
tell me that's proof that is Mars unless
these<00:05:16.060> Rovers<00:05:16.570> or<00:05:16.840> something<00:05:17.229> we're<00:05:17.410> faked

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
proof that life exists on Mars there's

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.760 
proof that life exists on Mars there's
another<00:05:24.640> box<00:05:25.060> shape<00:05:25.390> right<00:05:25.690> there<00:05:26.020> a<00:05:26.050> perfect
