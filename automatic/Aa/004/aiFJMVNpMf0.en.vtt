00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.750
 hey people i look like this when i have something 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.780
 normal gambling 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.759
 well and that's what I look like when I'm tough 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.860
 on data is gamers really synonymous now 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.330
 not really or oh no that can 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.560
 not be true so how do you get on 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.560
 so what and why that is 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:35.920
 heart of darkness is a game in which 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:42.190
 One dies many times one dies and one dies 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:44.940
 dies and piece again only to again 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.940
 to strengthen 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:51.170
 but from the beginning hard of darkness is one 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.150
 1998 for pc and playstation appeared 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.280
 platform one takes over the role of 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.780
 andy a boy whiskey his dog 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.940
 during a solar eclipse 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.100
 dark creatures are stolen with one 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.260
 self-built electromagnetic gun he flies 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.690
 in self-built flight controller directly in 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.240
 he experiences a fantasy world there 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.890
 adventure in search of whiskey me 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.440
 I also have adventure on the search 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.270
 that was developed after usk 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.430
 Game of short-lived studio amazing 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.690
 games which largely divide 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.760
 The people also insisted on the 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.369
 platforms evergreens flashback and the 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.270
 name world participated 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.010
 remarkable about the game is that the 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.930
 Development time was six years 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.220
 that was mainly because that much 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.750
 Expense in the soundtrack and the 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.760
 between sequences has flowed 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.770
 the game was released by the 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.330
 general criticism positively received 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.560
 but was criticized especially the 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.119
 stale graphic 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.340
 Now I'm watching the game and 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.050
 have to say that is super detailed and 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.759
 Lovingly made technically too 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.670
 definitely on the standard of the late 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.380
 90s ok everything was not a bunch of that time 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.150
 polygon experiment was was as 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.920
 poorly titled now we lay down though 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.720
 that at the same time appeared and 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.070
 because of his graphic at that time highly praised 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.960
 tomb raider three next to it 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.370
 what is going on there now shabby 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.370
 from heart of darkness 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.290
 no, the ingame graphic I find almost 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.149
 Already timeless the sting the very rough 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.000
 ranged between sequences genuinely off 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.500
 everything works out of one piece the world of the game 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.150
 appears mystical and fascinating 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.550
 alien while the characters anyway 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.910
 nice cheeky comic booklets are also available 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.230
 the animations are very smooth 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.910
 next to the graphic I also thinks of 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.190
 diversification into challenges and 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.959
 level sections very positive none 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.549
 screen equal to the other as the 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.180
 tasks to get ahead 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:31.190
 Need to become 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.380
 sometimes you shoot yourself through enemy hordes 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.519
 sometimes you put a daredevil 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.980
 climbing a maneuver 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.019
 shoots the way free evades opponents 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.580
 Ladders builds the game 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.530
 some of his possibilities 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.360
 But the good change is also 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.100
 badly needed at the end of the game 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.420
 you will get the most sections again 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.650
 and played again and again 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.120
 that is not only on 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.980
 Difficulty simply because of that 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.200
 many things are unpredictable and make a 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.690
 perfect timing and perfect controller 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.920
 reaction demands individual positions 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.520
 you have to do it again and again 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.290
 play 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.000
 I alone have one hour of footage 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.480
 of which try this wall high 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.489
 come 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.080
 that's not because this wall is so 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.640
 Nice is the game I have as 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.830
 scary long and extensive in 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.180
 It is not remembrance you can do it in 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.400
 under two hours if you can 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.019
 not constantly up scratching its scope 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.730
 Generates it from the numerous 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.670
 try the one also as wily 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:25.880
 player needed bitter and also this 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:29.549
 was also at this election 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.769
 I also try this wall up really real 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.750
 now 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.730
 this wall is just as could now 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.100
 this shit from tanner he's around this 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.500
 I try to shorten it 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.060
 So cut short to say about one 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.680
 Half an hour trying this wall 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.860
 I finally reach the top 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:55.880
 output at the i want to see again 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:55.880
 really real now 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.930
 Chancery clumsy and brother 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.210
 after I really broke 1 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:24.039
 really make me know that game 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.199
 now from outside the screen 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:28.120
 So, in all frustration, you'll be shot down 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:30.759
 already caused in this game anyway 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.949
 That's one way to go 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:35.050
 sensitive border as said the 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:36.910
 Difficulty is okay man 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.069
 can do it all if 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.229
 is considered a little focus 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:43.599
 and with patience and the environment 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:45.610
 Watched carefully at the tenth trial 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:46.180
 I have a patience but I have a patience 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.979
 no more 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.990
 that does not create a challenge 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:51.849
 but frustration that's the biggest 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.650
 critical point that I have to the game 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:55.840
 I played it through 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.310
 not preparation after i start 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.050
 nor was totally hot on the game took 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.639
 a lust always down to me 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:06.070
 thought yes you saw it 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:07.960
 this wall 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.970
 art of darkness is still a tip for 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.530
 all fans nice platform his 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.480
 Strengths are the great atmosphere 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.400
 varied theaters that 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.710
 youth adventure flair as well as the 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.540
 funny side characters his biggest 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.670
 Weakness is that it gives the player more 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.540
 patience demanded as a otto normal gamblers 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.760
 can muster 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.010
 but who either a challenge 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:30.450
 or an end sequence in 90s 3d 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:32.560
 he is well advised with the game 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:40.260
 as well as I finish the video now 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:40.260
 best under water plant
