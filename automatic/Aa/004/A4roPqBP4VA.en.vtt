00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.159
 From the highest places in Khabarovsk - here it is - all 

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:06.470
 Cupid at hand, in order to be here 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.180
 before normal water well is required (experience of neighbors 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.790
 shows) depth of not less than one hundred meters. Still 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.260
 a few years ago in order to drill a well, 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.340
 would have to work a half or even two months. Via 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.449
 here this installation such a well will be made 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:30.449
 exactly two days. 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.920
 This is probably the slowest part of the job. Auger he's like 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.550
 the grinder chews the ground and lifts it out 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.309
 future wellbore. Further work will go much 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.540
 faster. With the help of the auger are only soft 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.800
 rocks that lie on the surface - clay, loam. 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.809
 But as soon as the auger feather rests on hard rock, 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.379
 another tool is entering the rock - pneumatic impact 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.760
 hammer. With the help of this nozzle, (called chisel) 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.529
 it just breaks the stone inside the well. But through 

00:01:06.529 --> 00:01:09.950
 these "nostrils" are blown in by the air that blows out the rock 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.209
 upstairs Now you will see how it works. 

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:19.209
 At the depth of the pneumatic hammer breaks the rock in such 

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:28.459
 fine crumb, and then literally blows it out of the well, 

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:34.219
 from a depth of two hundred and three hundred meters, if necessary. 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:38.270
 But in order to expel the air from a great depth, 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.770
 and the pressure must be given huge - at about fifteen 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.179
 times more than a standard car wheel. Compressor, 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:52.209
 a pump for this is required. 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:55.429
 But at the moment when the pneumatic hammer reaches the aquifer 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.109
 layer, the air is already beginning to lift up a rock 

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:02.709
 not the earth, but the water itself. It happens about 

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:09.709
 like this. Let's go ... Four, three .. two ... one ... There now 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:18.180
 blowing air blowing blowing .. That's it!
