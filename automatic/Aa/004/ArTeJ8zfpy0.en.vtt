00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 black wave and then good I bring you to 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.410
 the review what the blog would be 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:09.809
 launcher in its beta 2 version and this 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.910
 It already lets you put textures so let's go 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.250
 to be able to use the block launcher to 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.839
 put textures and well I'll also leave what 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.630
 that would be the forum link of what 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.390
 would be the texture pack eleven of 12 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.100
 of time for you to understand me when 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.980
 go to the forum to download it they will 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.170
 click and wait for the advertising that 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.330
 leave the one who made the forum or who did the 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.529
 the post and from there jumping and going to 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.270
 send to another page where will you say 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.210
 if you want to download the texture by 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.829
 apk or if you need it so that 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.420
 then they can install it from here as well 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.460
 how good first do that what I say 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.129
 do not 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.329
 then once they have downloaded the 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.059
 texture again I repeat have to 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.290
 download the zip not the apk and read it in 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.879
 the little key that launches options 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.300
 requires a texture package restart 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.190
 they give him to select and they give him where they have 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.850
 saved the texture package in this 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.510
 I have it in the download folder 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.210
 and here is the 11th of Pakistan 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.510
 here it is if they see it because there it is that 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.460
 both mom have here and good 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.070
 and ready they give back and already they 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.720
 will install lcd as it does not let install 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.490
 little mom's motto so still 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.080
 it will continue to appear it is error but 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.490
 because it lets you install because texture 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.940
 in this case to enter the world of 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.440
 texture and good to see what it is 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.810
 very good is up the spiders and all the 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.730
 village roll at 0.11 so no 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.130
 we will have a problem with none of it 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:33.369
 as far as I know the bats 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.500

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:38.479
