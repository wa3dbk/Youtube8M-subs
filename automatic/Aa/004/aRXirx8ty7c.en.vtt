which<00:03:15.250> isn't<00:03:15.520> great<00:03:15.610> because<00:03:16.090> it<00:03:16.180> has<00:03:16.300> been

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450

shine<00:03:24.010> up<00:03:24.190> like<00:03:24.310> I<00:03:24.340> said<00:03:24.580> that<00:03:24.730> you<00:03:24.820> put<00:03:25.000> in<00:03:25.090> the

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
shine up like I said that you put in the

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.340

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
dye and that kind of made it a lot

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.960 
dye and that kind of made it a lot
healthier<00:03:26.620> a<00:03:27.120> lot<00:03:28.120> healthier<00:03:28.300> feeling<00:03:28.959> um<00:03:29.970> the

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
healthier a lot healthier feeling um the

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.350 
healthier a lot healthier feeling um the
camera<00:03:31.450> isn't<00:03:31.870> massively<00:03:32.530> picking<00:03:33.010> up<00:03:33.360> the

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.690 
camera isn't massively picking up the
color<00:03:34.570> so<00:03:35.440> I'm<00:03:35.500> going<00:03:35.680> to<00:03:35.709> put<00:03:35.860> in<00:03:35.980> a<00:03:36.010> cult<00:03:36.340> what
