00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
your kids with stuff like this and boys

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.920 
your kids with stuff like this and boys
like<00:00:19.529> this<00:00:19.710> one<00:00:19.890> this<00:00:20.820> one<00:00:21.090> takes<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.810> little

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
like this one this one takes a little

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.750 
like this one this one takes a little
bit<00:00:22.080> longer<00:00:22.320> so<00:00:22.650> it's<00:00:22.800> not<00:00:22.920> best<00:00:23.160> for<00:00:23.369> super

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
bit longer so it's not best for super

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.290 
bit longer so it's not best for super
super<00:00:24.060> long<00:00:24.240> lines<00:00:25.250> but<00:00:26.250> it's<00:00:26.460> not<00:00:26.640> too<00:00:27.029> slow

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
super long lines but it's not too slow

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.750 
super long lines but it's not too slow
so<00:00:28.289> any<00:00:28.529> size<00:00:28.769> brush<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.250> really<00:00:29.279> doesn't

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
so any size brush it really doesn't

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.049 
so any size brush it really doesn't
matter<00:00:29.849> if<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.510> had<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:31.080> clean<00:00:31.529> number<00:00:32.520> six<00:00:32.850> I

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
matter if I had a clean number six I

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.110 
matter if I had a clean number six I
probably<00:00:33.630> use<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:34.250> but<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.760> one<00:00:35.940> I

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
probably use that but this is the one I

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.530 
probably use that but this is the one I
went<00:00:36.329> for<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.899> paradise<00:00:37.739> silver<00:00:38.540> any

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
went for this is a paradise silver any

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.319 
went for this is a paradise silver any

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
silver will do I'm just going to get

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.440 
silver will do I'm just going to get
that<00:00:42.540> on<00:00:42.690> my<00:00:42.809> brush<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:44.059> I'm<00:00:45.059> going<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.300> do

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
that on my brush and I'm going to do

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.029 
that on my brush and I'm going to do
this<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:46.620> way<00:00:47.059> so<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.149> can<00:00:48.420> see<00:00:48.800> so<00:00:49.800> this<00:00:50.010> is

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
this this way so you can see so this is

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.110 
this this way so you can see so this is
sideways<00:00:50.640> alright<00:00:51.510> hopefully<00:00:52.820> it'll<00:00:53.820> still

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
sideways alright hopefully it'll still

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.990 
sideways alright hopefully it'll still
make<00:00:54.270> sense<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.500> I'm<00:00:56.489> thinking<00:00:56.730> you're

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
make sense and I'm thinking you're

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.220 
make sense and I'm thinking you're

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
probably going to have a hard time

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:05.030 
probably going to have a hard time
seeing<00:01:02.449> the<00:01:03.449> blade<00:01:03.809> but<00:01:04.140> I'll<00:01:04.409> outline<00:01:04.830> it

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
seeing the blade but I'll outline it

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.500 
seeing the blade but I'll outline it
later<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.640> can<00:01:05.729> look<00:01:06.000> at<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.240> more<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.479> i

thick chunky outlining tends to not look

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.670 
thick chunky outlining tends to not look
as<00:02:36.350> great<00:02:36.620> in<00:02:36.830> my<00:02:37.160> opinion<00:02:37.870> so<00:02:38.870> I<00:02:38.900> get<00:02:39.410> some

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
as great in my opinion so I get some

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.160 
as great in my opinion so I get some
tiny<00:02:40.070> brushes<00:02:40.490> and<00:02:40.970> try<00:02:41.900> to<00:02:41.960> limit<00:02:43.090> the

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
tiny brushes and try to limit the

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.800 
tiny brushes and try to limit the
thickness<00:02:45.170> of<00:02:45.380> your<00:02:45.550> outlines<00:02:46.550> so<00:02:47.450> wherever

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
thickness of your outlines so wherever

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.440 
thickness of your outlines so wherever
it<00:02:48.110> goes<00:02:48.170> in<00:02:48.560> or<00:02:49.010> curves<00:02:49.520> I<00:02:49.850> like<00:02:50.060> to<00:02:50.240> make<00:02:50.390> my

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
it goes in or curves I like to make my

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.150 
it goes in or curves I like to make my
outline<00:02:50.930> a<00:02:50.960> little<00:02:51.290> thicker<00:02:51.590> I<00:02:51.710> think<00:02:52.070> it

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
outline a little thicker I think it

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.240 
outline a little thicker I think it
looks<00:02:52.190> cooler<00:02:52.670> that<00:02:52.850> way<00:02:53.050> so<00:02:54.050> starting<00:02:54.530> here

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
looks cooler that way so starting here

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.120 
looks cooler that way so starting here
I'm<00:02:55.910> just<00:02:56.120> going<00:02:56.270> to<00:02:56.330> come<00:02:56.480> up<00:02:56.750> thicker<00:02:57.680> and

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
I'm just going to come up thicker and

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:06.940 
I'm just going to come up thicker and
end<00:02:58.400> like<00:02:59.390> that<00:03:00.160> so<00:03:01.160> up<00:03:02.230> thicker<00:03:03.230> and<00:03:05.830> come<00:03:06.830> on

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
end like that so up thicker and come on

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.460 
end like that so up thicker and come on
here<00:03:07.340> make<00:03:07.550> it<00:03:07.580> sick<00:03:08.030> like<00:03:08.450> it's<00:03:08.660> the<00:03:08.989> shadow

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
here make it sick like it's the shadow

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:16.449 
here make it sick like it's the shadow
of<00:03:09.650> the<00:03:09.950> ball<00:03:12.130> and<00:03:13.239> then<00:03:14.239> just<00:03:14.540> really<00:03:15.459> thin

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
of the ball and then just really thin

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:23.470 
of the ball and then just really thin
lines<00:03:16.820> around<00:03:17.090> this<00:03:17.450> way<00:03:21.010> just<00:03:22.010> a<00:03:22.130> tiny<00:03:22.640> thin

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
lines around this way just a tiny thin

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.699 
lines around this way just a tiny thin
line<00:03:23.750> at<00:03:23.989> the<00:03:24.110> top<00:03:24.350> of<00:03:24.380> their<00:03:26.080> and<00:03:27.080> for<00:03:27.410> these

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
line at the top of their and for these

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:34.270 
line at the top of their and for these
just<00:03:28.489> go<00:03:29.020> in<00:03:30.430> half<00:03:31.430> way<00:03:32.680> all<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:34.010> way<00:03:34.040> at<00:03:34.250> the

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
just go in half way all the way at the

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:44.560 
just go in half way all the way at the
bottom<00:03:35.650> halfway<00:03:36.650> halfway<00:03:37.190> halfway<00:03:40.150> and<00:03:43.570> down

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
bottom halfway halfway halfway and down

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.260 
bottom halfway halfway halfway and down
you<00:03:45.140> don't<00:03:45.230> have<00:03:45.440> to<00:03:45.620> go<00:03:46.190> all<00:03:46.550> the<00:03:46.670> way<00:03:46.940> through

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 
you don't have to go all the way through

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.350 
you don't have to go all the way through
you<00:03:47.480> can<00:03:47.660> just<00:03:47.870> do<00:03:48.050> kind<00:03:48.350> of<00:03:49.360> partial

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
you can just do kind of partial

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.420 
you can just do kind of partial
outlining<00:03:51.640> and<00:03:52.930> the<00:03:53.930> same<00:03:54.320> thing<00:03:54.350> right<00:03:55.100> down

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
outlining and the same thing right down

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.270 
outlining and the same thing right down
the<00:03:55.610> center<00:03:56.200> so<00:03:57.200> there's<00:03:57.470> all<00:03:57.770> the<00:03:57.920> outlining

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
the center so there's all the outlining

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.970 
the center so there's all the outlining
done<00:03:58.640> now<00:03:59.239> it<00:03:59.390> makes<00:03:59.570> this<00:03:59.810> sword<00:04:00.200> or<00:04:00.470> that<00:04:00.800> or

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
done now it makes this sword or that or

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.530 
done now it makes this sword or that or
the<00:04:01.010> dagger<00:04:01.519> are<00:04:01.820> the<00:04:01.970> highlights<00:04:02.390> the

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
the dagger are the highlights the

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.210 
the dagger are the highlights the
highlights<00:04:02.630> make<00:04:03.080> it<00:04:03.200> look<00:04:03.320> really<00:04:03.470> cool<00:04:03.800> so

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
highlights make it look really cool so

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.540 
highlights make it look really cool so
they're<00:04:04.850> important<00:04:05.330> to<00:04:05.360> do<00:04:05.570> I<00:04:06.310> need<00:04:07.310> some

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
they're important to do I need some

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:15.699 
they're important to do I need some
white<00:04:08.560> and<00:04:11.380> on<00:04:12.380> the<00:04:12.440> ball

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.110 

going<00:04:16.709> to<00:04:16.800> go<00:04:16.950> around<00:04:17.459> it<00:04:17.730> on<00:04:17.820> the<00:04:17.940> outside

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
going to go around it on the outside

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.479 
going to go around it on the outside
make<00:04:18.630> sure<00:04:18.660> when<00:04:19.080> you<00:04:19.230> do<00:04:19.500> highlights<00:04:20.190> on

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
make sure when you do highlights on

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.810 
make sure when you do highlights on
round<00:04:21.030> objects<00:04:21.690> to<00:04:22.410> try<00:04:22.620> to<00:04:22.680> stay<00:04:23.130> towards<00:04:23.670> the

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
round objects to try to stay towards the

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.840 
round objects to try to stay towards the
outside<00:04:24.770> because<00:04:25.770> if<00:04:26.010> you<00:04:26.130> go<00:04:26.250> on<00:04:26.400> the<00:04:26.520> middle

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
outside because if you go on the middle

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.220 
outside because if you go on the middle
they're<00:04:27.060> not<00:04:27.210> going<00:04:27.420> to<00:04:27.480> look<00:04:27.660> so<00:04:27.930> around

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
they're not going to look so around

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.500 
they're not going to look so around
wherever<00:04:29.070> you<00:04:29.610> think<00:04:29.670> the<00:04:30.180> light<00:04:30.420> would<00:04:30.630> hit

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
wherever you think the light would hit

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:38.630 
wherever you think the light would hit
do<00:04:33.510> an<00:04:34.460> outline<00:04:35.460> or<00:04:35.970> a<00:04:36.030> little<00:04:36.360> highlight<00:04:37.640> ok
