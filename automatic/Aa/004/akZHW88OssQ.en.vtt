00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 Dr 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.009
 to the emergency 

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:12.059
 yes, as I said, I flew to the States for you 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.409
 amongst other things 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:14.399
 Rheine 

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:16.609
 to acquire iPad 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:21.710
 and of course we want to unpack now because it is a stalemate 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.770
 a typical neat clean simply chic wrapped 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:27.519
 otherwise 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:32.189
 the whole thing only a white box with a few pick up and on my iPad 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.340
 buys 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.440
 and 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.440
 what will be there at the end of the day 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.300
 For one thing, that's a lot to listen to 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.980
 More on hearing it is called in the online shop will give 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.340
 and percent that is one 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.550
 this little word 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.270
 Data for Belzig 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.360
 just take a look 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.360
 the big turnaround is possible 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.220
 a cable 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.350
 and Do Mar from the Dock Connector to a clique before Gearbox becomes 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.420
 to connect an external monitor as a 1% flat screen the test becomes 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.210
 Rosat 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.200
 Next 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.470
 a very classic computer screen 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.740
 and the one older year the goal 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:16.680
 This is 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.460
 The center is full of blood for the iPad 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.550
 kept alive in cities 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.800
 the exciting thing about this circle is that it's not just spatially packaging 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.700
 and the old protected 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.700
 but that's just as well as being able to play on players or as well 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.380
 to scream give the age of previously supposedly 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.380
 so you do not necessarily have to get it on your feet 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.200
 it certainly goes without saying that in the following people introduce it in detail 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.150
 Now it continues with him on board 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.710
 ca 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.610
 continue it goes 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.530
 we give something in practice 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.240
 Hunting off per year 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.240
 5 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.729
 the bottom line stays on 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.940
 and 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.599
 There is already around there 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.209
 free entry 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.029
 in one version 

00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:19.639
 with 64 gigabytes 

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:23.399
 It feels clearly much harder than you get from one 

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:26.029
 iPhone or an iPod had as usual 

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:29.429
 just when you actually want to hold it in your hand, it slipped neatly 

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:30.589
 what in the country 

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:32.289
 and 

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:35.920
 that explains why Apple in the researchers videos 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.970
 always the iPad on the thighs turns right 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:42.719
 yes than in the box 

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:47.389
 this alone before keeper Apollo Klinkhammer last year 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:48.419
 was that? 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:51.419
 will be the usual small in top manager 

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:53.410
 on 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.410
 but also have correct footpath 

00:02:56.999 --> 00:02:59.809
 and capitals further 

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:00.889
 Oppenheim 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:02.159
 Na li device 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:03.489
 clearly 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.879
 for the us standard you 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.989
 had accumulated at midnight 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.159
 so 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.919
 Worms one thing is clear that a lot of plastic in the box 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:18.019
 Of course not enough 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.089
 and 

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:21.399
 why I want to get out 

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:22.919
 it's not enough 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.919
 there is nothing known 

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:28.939
 let's do these two 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:32.219
 Assad it was back again just as the paper back 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:33.670
 and 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.599
 then it continues immediately 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:41.529
 unpack the iPad sets Karl has 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:44.919
 the hand 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:47.919
 ca 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.229
 more 

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:56.229
 at least again and the carl-marx-house complained 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.179
 Percent as you can see that it is a very classic 

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:02.069
 USB 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:03.999
 adapter 

00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:07.169
 the us american cities system 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:11.139
 works confused thanks to good test naturally works wonderfully worldwide 

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:14.850
 and that's a yes from the iPad and iPod 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:15.950
 and so on 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.199
 known dock connector 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:21.199
 Riot b 

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.930
 the 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.719
 8 to the iPad 

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:27.389
 So that's a good thing 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:28.819
 the whole 

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:31.759
 everything wonderful with slides 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:33.990
 Dietmar 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.990
 H 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.370
 lie 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.490
 and you see 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.189
 Alfeld 

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:49.169
 With psalms, glasses reflected that they did not look beautiful consumption 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:50.979
 as we do not live 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:53.979
 while looking in the mirror myself if I'm somewhere 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:59.580
 hidden in the face or not otherwise it looks very very chic 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.580
 with the euro and the celebrities 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.059
 and 

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:07.469
 people should 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:09.900
 there is Rheine 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.330
 counter 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.979
 Dr 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:17.719
 is left off from the machine motion sensor activated 

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:21.919
 then the year in the switch for teachers, for example, the volume is high 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:23.089
 and down 

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:25.240
 See below like percent 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.620
 small speaker falls 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.360
 the chapel dock-connector grave

 iPhone and iPod Touch gives smiles 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:39.680
 sing and park on the device 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.680
 and on the other side of march nothing at all 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.490
 up here 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.719
 Zalman 3 4 5 millimeter jack plug 

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:50.180

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:55.740
 and 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.740
 Here is also on and off to see 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.610
 everything else 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.639
 which is currently being reported is the climb up put into operation 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.619
 and 

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:09.639
 Copenhagen 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:13.339
 that something happens, however, if the tension increases 

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:15.770
 and 17 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.029
 the typical apple 

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:20.029
