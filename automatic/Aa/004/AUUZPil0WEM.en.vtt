00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.529 
a few little clips as she was helping me
die<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.519> it's<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.699> little<00:00:29.849> bit<00:00:29.970> different<00:00:30.119> and

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
die so it's a little bit different and

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.150 
die so it's a little bit different and

fits<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.940> lighter<00:02:26.180> bits<00:02:26.450> a<00:02:26.780> little<00:02:27.080> bit

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
fits the lighter bits a little bit

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.660 
fits the lighter bits a little bit
overall<00:02:27.950> it<00:02:28.070> didn't<00:02:28.280> make<00:02:28.340> a<00:02:28.400> massive

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
overall it didn't make a massive

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.240 
overall it didn't make a massive
difference<00:02:28.790> I<00:02:29.420> mean<00:02:29.870> it's<00:02:30.560> not<00:02:30.710> going<00:02:30.980> to<00:02:31.100> is

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
difference I mean it's not going to is

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.280 
difference I mean it's not going to is
it<00:02:31.400> so<00:02:31.700> I<00:02:31.730> made<00:02:32.030> a<00:02:32.060> little<00:02:32.330> difference<00:02:32.540> and

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
it so I made a little difference and

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.780 
it so I made a little difference and

part in normally what it wouldn't look
right

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
right

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.200

00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:02.850 
pink you know I'm like I changed my mind
constantly<00:06:00.310> I<00:06:00.669> probably<00:06:00.880> have<00:06:01.240> blue<00:06:01.840> her<00:06:02.470> next

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
constantly I probably have blue her next

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.800

week<00:06:02.979> who<00:06:03.250> knows<00:06:03.460> I'm<00:06:04.060> really<00:06:04.300> happy<00:06:04.449> with<00:06:04.660> the

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
week who knows I'm really happy with the

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:09.360 
week who knows I'm really happy with the
color<00:06:04.840> and<00:06:05.830> yeah<00:06:07.680> the<00:06:08.680> Lighting's<00:06:09.070> a<00:06:09.130> little

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
color and yeah the Lighting's a little

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:10.529 
color and yeah the Lighting's a little
bit<00:06:09.460> different<00:06:09.729> in<00:06:09.820> this<00:06:09.910> video<00:06:10.150> because<00:06:10.449> I've

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:10.539 
bit different in this video because I've

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:12.210 
bit different in this video because I've
got<00:06:10.660> it<00:06:10.690> on<00:06:10.840> tungsten<00:06:11.350> light<00:06:11.530> so<00:06:11.919> it's<00:06:12.070> like<00:06:12.190> a

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.220 
got it on tungsten light so it's like a

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.100 
got it on tungsten light so it's like a
blue<00:06:12.490> tone<00:06:12.820> so<00:06:13.180> you<00:06:13.270> can<00:06:13.389> see<00:06:13.510> the<00:06:13.660> pink<00:06:13.840> more

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
blue tone so you can see the pink more

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.680 
blue tone so you can see the pink more
as<00:06:14.590> opposed<00:06:14.979> to<00:06:15.130> like<00:06:15.400> normal<00:06:15.820> white<00:06:16.300> balance

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
as opposed to like normal white balance

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.839 
as opposed to like normal white balance
this<00:06:17.500> is<00:06:17.560> probably<00:06:17.860> making<00:06:18.039> no<00:06:18.310> sense<00:06:18.520> to

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:18.849 
this is probably making no sense to

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:20.310 
this is probably making no sense to
anyone<00:06:19.150> that<00:06:19.720> doesn't<00:06:19.840> know<00:06:19.960> anything<00:06:20.169> about

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:20.320 
anyone that doesn't know anything about

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.920 
anyone that doesn't know anything about
photography<00:06:20.500> but<00:06:21.070> anyway<00:06:21.430> and<00:06:22.419> I<00:06:22.510> like<00:06:22.690> it<00:06:22.840> as

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930 
photography but anyway and I like it as

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.629 
photography but anyway and I like it as
well<00:06:22.960> because<00:06:23.410> it's<00:06:23.590> kind<00:06:23.889> of<00:06:24.039> a<00:06:24.130> peachy<00:06:24.610> color

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639 
well because it's kind of a peachy color

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:27.270 
well because it's kind of a peachy color
as<00:06:25.479> well<00:06:25.720> it's<00:06:26.169> got<00:06:26.349> some<00:06:26.530> peach<00:06:26.710> tones<00:06:27.039> in

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 
as well it's got some peach tones in

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.070 
as well it's got some peach tones in
there<00:06:27.430> so<00:06:27.669> I'm<00:06:28.300> just<00:06:28.360> going<00:06:28.630> to<00:06:28.720> show<00:06:28.870> you<00:06:28.930> what

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
there so I'm just going to show you what

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.320 
there so I'm just going to show you what
it<00:06:29.169> looks<00:06:29.320> like<00:06:29.470> in<00:06:29.710> normal<00:06:30.130> white<00:06:30.370> balance<00:06:30.729> so

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.330 
it looks like in normal white balance so

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.879 
it looks like in normal white balance so
this<00:06:31.479> is<00:06:31.599> normal<00:06:31.960> white<00:06:32.080> balance<00:06:32.500> you<00:06:32.620> can<00:06:32.770> see

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:32.889 
this is normal white balance you can see

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:35.040 
this is normal white balance you can see
that<00:06:33.010> everything's<00:06:33.370> warmer<00:06:33.940> it's<00:06:34.630> just<00:06:34.840> more

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.050 
that everything's warmer it's just more

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:39.000 
that everything's warmer it's just more
of<00:06:35.169> a<00:06:35.260> peachy<00:06:35.500> pink<00:06:37.200> but<00:06:38.200> I<00:06:38.229> just<00:06:38.440> really<00:06:38.740> like

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.010 
of a peachy pink but I just really like

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.800 
of a peachy pink but I just really like
the<00:06:39.310> way<00:06:39.430> that<00:06:39.610> tungsten<00:06:40.060> light<00:06:40.210> looked<00:06:40.510> so

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:40.810 
the way that tungsten light looked so

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.600 
the way that tungsten light looked so
that's<00:06:41.050> why<00:06:41.200> I<00:06:41.229> set<00:06:41.680> it<00:06:41.830> to<00:06:41.860> that<00:06:42.130> this<00:06:42.490> is

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:42.610 
that's why I set it to that this is

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.159 
that's why I set it to that this is
weird<00:06:42.789> I've<00:06:43.120> never<00:06:43.330> filmed<00:06:43.539> a<00:06:43.750> video<00:06:43.840> like

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:44.169 
weird I've never filmed a video like

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:45.510
