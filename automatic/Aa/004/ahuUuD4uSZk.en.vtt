00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.870 
first and foremost so that should be a
core<00:01:53.590> part<00:01:53.619> of<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:53.979> game<00:01:54.040> crazy<00:01:55.000> I<00:01:55.180> know<00:01:55.330> but

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
core part of the game crazy I know but

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.279 
core part of the game crazy I know but
this<00:01:57.880> shouldn't<00:01:58.149> be<00:01:58.210> too<00:01:58.299> difficult<00:01:58.479> to<00:01:58.960> fix

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
this shouldn't be too difficult to fix

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.219 
this shouldn't be too difficult to fix
as<00:01:59.590> much<00:02:00.310> as<00:02:00.490> I<00:02:00.580> love<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:01.090> huge<00:02:01.509> environments

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
as much as I love the huge environments

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.139 
as much as I love the huge environments
with<00:02:02.380> scattered<00:02:02.860> treasure<00:02:03.159> it<00:02:03.850> didn't<00:02:04.060> make

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
with scattered treasure it didn't make

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:05.010 
with scattered treasure it didn't make
much<00:02:04.360> sense

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
much sense

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.070 
much sense
why<00:02:05.920> would<00:02:06.130> Laura<00:02:06.340> hunt<00:02:06.640> Condor<00:02:07.240> nests<00:02:07.659> anyway

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
why would Laura hunt Condor nests anyway

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.469 
why would Laura hunt Condor nests anyway
if<00:02:08.350> the<00:02:09.100> outside<00:02:09.489> environments<00:02:10.119> were<00:02:10.239> used

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
if the outside environments were used

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.449 
if the outside environments were used
more<00:02:10.690> for<00:02:10.810> platforming<00:02:11.500> challenges<00:02:11.530> while

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
more for platforming challenges while

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.009 
more for platforming challenges while
the<00:02:12.640> tombs<00:02:12.880> were<00:02:13.120> filled<00:02:13.390> with<00:02:13.480> ancient

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
the tombs were filled with ancient

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.320 
the tombs were filled with ancient
artifacts<00:02:14.470> and<00:02:14.650> puzzles<00:02:15.100> it<00:02:15.700> would<00:02:15.850> add<00:02:16.000> great

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
artifacts and puzzles it would add great

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.380 
artifacts and puzzles it would add great
diversity<00:02:16.840> and<00:02:17.110> be<00:02:17.590> logical<00:02:18.220> sounds<00:02:18.880> ideal<00:02:19.180> to

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
diversity and be logical sounds ideal to

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.990 
diversity and be logical sounds ideal to
me

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.300 

I've<00:02:23.600> ranted<00:02:24.050> about<00:02:24.320> regenerating<00:02:25.100> health

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
I've ranted about regenerating health

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.130 
I've ranted about regenerating health
for<00:02:25.520> so<00:02:25.730> long<00:02:25.910> I<00:02:26.090> just<00:02:26.120> assumed<00:02:26.660> people<00:02:26.870> have

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
for so long I just assumed people have

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.290 
for so long I just assumed people have
tuned<00:02:27.380> me<00:02:27.500> out<00:02:27.530> but<00:02:28.280> I<00:02:28.310> really<00:02:28.730> don't<00:02:28.880> care

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
tuned me out but I really don't care

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.480 
tuned me out but I really don't care
going<00:02:30.110> from<00:02:30.260> near<00:02:30.590> death<00:02:30.620> to<00:02:30.890> full<00:02:31.310> strength

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
going from near death to full strength

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.640 
going from near death to full strength
by<00:02:31.880> standing<00:02:32.330> still<00:02:32.600> for<00:02:32.630> three<00:02:33.050> seconds<00:02:33.530> is

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
by standing still for three seconds is

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.250 
by standing still for three seconds is
super<00:02:34.250> dumb<00:02:34.520> it<00:02:35.240> eliminates<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:35.870> fear<00:02:36.200> of

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
super dumb it eliminates the fear of

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.100 
super dumb it eliminates the fear of
confrontation<00:02:36.710> and<00:02:37.340> destroys<00:02:37.790> any<00:02:38.390> attempt

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
confrontation and destroys any attempt

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.470 
confrontation and destroys any attempt
at<00:02:39.200> a<00:02:39.260> logical<00:02:39.710> narrative<00:02:40.070> there<00:02:40.850> I<00:02:40.880> said<00:02:41.330> it

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
at a logical narrative there I said it

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.630 
at a logical narrative there I said it
so<00:02:42.110> what<00:02:42.320> if<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:42.500> new<00:02:42.650> to<00:02:42.830> mayor<00:02:43.040> got<00:02:43.310> rid<00:02:43.610> of

so what if the new to mayor got rid of

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.060 
so what if the new to mayor got rid of
that<00:02:43.760> system<00:02:44.150> completely<00:02:44.660> I<00:02:45.020> know<00:02:45.590> there<00:02:45.980> are
