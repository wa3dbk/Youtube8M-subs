00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
some half-tones to see if I could get

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.039 
some half-tones to see if I could get
some<00:02:31.530> value<00:02:31.920> so<00:02:32.549> make<00:02:33.239> sure<00:02:33.269> there's<00:02:33.599> no<00:02:33.720> not

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
some value so make sure there's no not

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.140 
some value so make sure there's no not
too<00:02:34.200> much<00:02:34.319> glisten<00:02:34.739> on<00:02:34.859> these<00:02:35.069> but<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:36.000> can

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
too much glisten on these but you can

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.470 
too much glisten on these but you can
see<00:02:36.329> kind<00:02:36.510> of<00:02:36.629> the<00:02:37.370> value<00:02:38.370> range<00:02:38.640> in<00:02:38.849> those<00:02:39.030> so

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
see kind of the value range in those so

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.289 
see kind of the value range in those so
kind<00:02:40.349> of<00:02:40.439> gives<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.709> 3d<00:02:41.069> effect<00:02:41.159> or<00:02:41.819> grayscale

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
kind of gives a 3d effect or grayscale

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.069 
kind of gives a 3d effect or grayscale
effect<00:02:42.689> and<00:02:43.170> assorted<00:02:44.159> colors<00:02:44.549> as<00:02:44.730> well<00:02:45.079> we

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
14 x 14 huge classic design you're just

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.759 
14 x 14 huge classic design you're just
absolutely<00:03:11.790> massive<00:03:12.419> sheet<00:03:13.109> of<00:03:13.230> vinyl<00:03:13.590> those

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
absolutely massive sheet of vinyl those

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.520 
absolutely massive sheet of vinyl those
are<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:15.030> widest<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:15.750> then<00:03:15.900> these<00:03:16.260> are<00:03:16.409> the

think absolutely massive love design
these<00:03:22.769> ones<00:03:23.010> came<00:03:23.220> out<00:03:23.340> cool<00:03:23.549> and<00:03:23.819> these<00:03:24.629> ones

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
these ones came out cool and these ones

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.099 
these ones came out cool and these ones
are<00:03:25.049> in<00:03:25.139> white<00:03:25.349> and<00:03:25.729> then<00:03:26.729> again<00:03:26.970> in<00:03:27.120> bread<00:03:27.359> so

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
are in white and then again in bread so

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.289 
are in white and then again in bread so
there's<00:03:28.799> probably<00:03:28.919> maybe<00:03:29.549> only<00:03:29.760> 20<00:03:30.120> of<00:03:30.209> those

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
there's probably maybe only 20 of those

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.800 
there's probably maybe only 20 of those
but<00:03:30.629> you<00:03:30.659> know<00:03:30.930> if<00:03:31.440> you<00:03:31.680> do<00:03:32.099> the<00:03:32.250> math<00:03:32.280> there<00:03:33.060> 20

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
but you know if you do the math there 20

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.059 
but you know if you do the math there 20
of<00:03:33.900> these<00:03:33.989> equal<00:03:34.409> probably<00:03:34.739> a<00:03:34.799> couple<00:03:34.919> hundred

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
of these equal probably a couple hundred

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.059 
of these equal probably a couple hundred
stickers<00:03:35.669> easy<00:03:36.389> and<00:03:36.780> yeah<00:03:37.590> so<00:03:37.829> if<00:03:37.889> you<00:03:37.949> got

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
stickers easy and yeah so if you got

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.930 
stickers easy and yeah so if you got
about<00:03:38.280> fifteen<00:03:38.699> hundred<00:03:38.729> stickers<00:03:39.329> total

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
about fifteen hundred stickers total

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.490 
about fifteen hundred stickers total
really<00:03:41.940> had<00:03:42.060> fun<00:03:42.239> doing<00:03:42.419> this<00:03:42.659> he<00:03:42.900> left<00:03:43.199> a<00:03:43.319> lot

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
really had fun doing this he left a lot

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.589 
really had fun doing this he left a lot
of<00:03:43.590> it<00:03:43.680> up<00:03:43.799> to<00:03:43.949> me<00:03:44.069> he<00:03:44.340> was<00:03:44.549> a<00:03:44.579> pretty<00:03:45.359> lenient

of all the stuff I did and suppose since

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:04.909 
of all the stuff I did and suppose since
this<00:04:03.659> package<00:04:04.019> is<00:04:04.169> open<00:04:04.439> i'll<00:04:04.530> run<00:04:04.709> through

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:04.919 
this package is open i'll run through

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:08.750 
this package is open i'll run through
these<00:04:05.099> and<00:04:06.079> show<00:04:07.079> you<00:04:07.139> got<00:04:07.500> two<00:04:08.489> different

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
these and show you got two different

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.520 
these and show you got two different
shades<00:04:08.909> of<00:04:09.090> green<00:04:09.299> i<00:04:09.599> tried<00:04:10.079> ordering<00:04:10.290> the

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
shades of green i tried ordering the

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.530 
shades of green i tried ordering the
same<00:04:10.739> one<00:04:10.949> but<00:04:11.099> i<00:04:11.159> guess<00:04:11.430> it<00:04:11.669> came<00:04:12.090> differently

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
same one but i guess it came differently

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.749 
same one but i guess it came differently
so<00:04:12.689> we<00:04:12.780> got<00:04:12.900> the<00:04:13.019> lighter<00:04:13.290> green<00:04:13.590> and<00:04:13.829> a<00:04:14.250> little

so we got the lighter green and a little

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:19.039 
so we got the lighter green and a little
bit<00:04:14.849> darker<00:04:15.000> green<00:04:15.530> we'll<00:04:16.530> get<00:04:16.650> some<00:04:16.859> red<00:04:18.049> got
