00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
a half step so instead of this being an

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.609

e<00:01:28.080> it's<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:29.150> b-flat<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.630> down<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.170> line<00:01:31.290> every

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
e it's a b-flat and down the line every

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.350 
e it's a b-flat and down the line every
