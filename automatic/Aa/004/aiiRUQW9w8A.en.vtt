00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
of your book we're going to create a

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.709 
of your book we're going to create a
signature<00:01:01.110> by<00:01:01.500> folding<00:01:02.190> each<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.329> seven

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
signature by folding each of the seven

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.010 
signature by folding each of the seven
sheets<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.439> half<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.640> we<00:01:06.390> are<00:01:06.450> going<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.750> do<00:01:06.990> a

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
sheets in half and we are going to do a

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.380 
sheets in half and we are going to do a
soft<00:01:07.320> fold<00:01:07.620> in<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:08.010> hard<00:01:08.310> fold<00:01:08.670> with<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.090> bone

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
soft fold in a hard fold with the bone

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.620 
soft fold in a hard fold with the bone
folder<00:01:09.860> so<00:01:10.860> once<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.400> have<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.820> seven<00:01:12.150> sheets

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
folder so once you have the seven sheets

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.810 
folder so once you have the seven sheets
you're<00:01:13.440> going<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.770> put<00:01:14.070> them<00:01:14.220> inside<00:01:14.400> each

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
you're going to put them inside each

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:22.160 
you're going to put them inside each
other<00:01:15.650> to<00:01:16.650> form<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.310> booklet

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.180 

so<00:01:22.710> now<00:01:22.920> let's<00:01:23.159> work<00:01:23.250> on<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.580> comer<00:01:24.440> and<00:01:25.440> we're

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
so now let's work on the comer and we're

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.020 
so now let's work on the comer and we're
just<00:01:26.340> gonna<00:01:26.610> make<00:01:27.420> sure<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.960> same<00:01:28.800> size<00:01:29.400> or

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
just gonna make sure is same size or

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.830 
just gonna make sure is same size or
bigger<00:01:31.460> and<00:01:32.460> we're<00:01:33.060> going<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.300> start<00:01:33.690> by

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
bigger and we're going to start by

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.160 
bigger and we're going to start by
folding<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.530> in<00:01:34.680> half<00:01:35.300> and<00:01:36.300> using<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.960> bone

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
folding it in half and using the bone

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.200 
folding it in half and using the bone
folder<00:01:37.409> for<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.010> heart<00:01:38.369> fold

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.149 

then<00:01:42.990> we're<00:01:43.200> going<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.470> put<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.799> signature

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
then we're going to put the signature

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.200 
then we're going to put the signature
inside<00:01:44.940> the<00:01:45.240> folded<00:01:45.659> cover<00:01:46.159> and<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:48.000> might

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
inside the folded cover and you might

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.190 
inside the folded cover and you might
notice<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.750> your<00:01:48.900> edges<00:01:49.500> are<00:01:49.710> not<00:01:50.190> perfect

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
notice that your edges are not perfect

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.070 
notice that your edges are not perfect
so<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.290> can<00:01:52.560> take<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:53.330> cardboard<00:01:54.330> put<00:01:54.930> it

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
so you can take a cardboard put it

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.469 
so you can take a cardboard put it
underneath<00:01:55.320> if<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.890> don't<00:01:56.100> have<00:01:56.479> cutting

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
underneath if you don't have cutting

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.180 
underneath if you don't have cutting
that<00:01:58.040> and<00:01:59.180> grab<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.210> ruler<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.930> pass<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.920> box

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
that and grab a ruler and pass the box

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.359 
that and grab a ruler and pass the box
cutter<00:02:02.550> along<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.450> edge<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:04.020> few<00:02:04.740> times<00:02:05.009> to

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
cutter along the edge a few times to

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.940 
cutter along the edge a few times to
make<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.600> same<00:02:06.840> size<00:02:07.259> as<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:08.220> cover<00:02:09.950> so

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
make it the same size as the cover so

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.559 
make it the same size as the cover so
once<00:02:11.160> you've<00:02:11.370> done<00:02:11.550> that<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.819> few<00:02:11.910> times<00:02:12.120> you

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
once you've done that a few times you

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.370 
once you've done that a few times you
should<00:02:12.720> have<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:12.900> nice<00:02:13.370> straight<00:02:14.370> edge<00:02:15.380> that

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
should have a nice straight edge that

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.620 
should have a nice straight edge that
aligns<00:02:16.739> with<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.190> cover<00:02:17.459> and<00:02:17.820> you<00:02:18.330> can<00:02:18.360> do

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
aligns with the cover and you can do

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.310 
aligns with the cover and you can do
this<00:02:18.810> on<00:02:19.590> all<00:02:19.860> three<00:02:20.190> sides

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.750 

so<00:02:25.320> once<00:02:25.500> we<00:02:25.680> have<00:02:25.890> that<00:02:25.920> we're<00:02:26.310> going<00:02:26.460> to<00:02:26.520> make

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
so once we have that we're going to make

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.010 
so once we have that we're going to make
the<00:02:26.910> template<00:02:27.390> for<00:02:27.570> the<00:02:27.750> inside<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:30.020> this

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
the template for the inside and this

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.210 
the template for the inside and this
template<00:02:31.500> will<00:02:31.740> be<00:02:31.770> for<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.280> holes<00:02:32.580> just<00:02:34.220> make

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
template will be for the holes just make

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.590 
template will be for the holes just make
sure<00:02:35.400> this<00:02:35.610> exact<00:02:36.510> same<00:02:36.780> height<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:38.600> the

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
sure this exact same height and the

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.780 
sure this exact same height and the
width<00:02:39.840> is<00:02:40.200> up<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.680> you<00:02:40.860> I<00:02:40.920> just<00:02:41.040> made<00:02:41.490> it<00:02:41.640> the

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
width is up to you I just made it the

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.960 
width is up to you I just made it the
same<00:02:42.030> size<00:02:42.240> as<00:02:42.450> a<00:02:42.480> ruler<00:02:42.870> so<00:02:43.200> there<00:02:43.440> will<00:02:43.560> be

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
same size as a ruler so there will be

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.690 
same size as a ruler so there will be
five<00:02:44.970> holes<00:02:45.360> in<00:02:45.660> total<00:02:46.160> and<00:02:47.160> we're<00:02:47.520> going<00:02:47.670> to

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
five holes in total and we're going to

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:58.520 
five holes in total and we're going to
measure<00:02:48.000> two<00:02:48.630> centimetres<00:02:49.530> on<00:02:50.250> each<00:02:50.670> end<00:02:57.530> and

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
measure two centimetres on each end and

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.280 
measure two centimetres on each end and
once<00:02:59.520> we<00:02:59.790> have<00:02:59.970> that<00:03:00.240> we're<00:03:00.420> going<00:03:00.600> to<00:03:00.690> fold<00:03:01.140> a

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
once we have that we're going to fold a

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:08.180 
once we have that we're going to fold a
template<00:03:01.770> in<00:03:01.890> half<00:03:03.440> and<00:03:06.620> put<00:03:07.620> it<00:03:07.770> in<00:03:07.920> half

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
template in half and put it in half

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.339
