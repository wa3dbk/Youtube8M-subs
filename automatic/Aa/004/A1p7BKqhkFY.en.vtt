00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.000
 smartphone 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.870
 of the xperia range in my case I'm going to 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.930
 choose the speed and m 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.970

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.210
 any video if you had a zeta 280 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.210
 3 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.159
 in my case I chose the xperia m 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:19.359
 this action then what we are going to give 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:21.490
 to see it is more recent the dwelling 

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:23.590
 to look 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.720
 and start scanning all the 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.409
 versions that there are of all countries or 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:33.509
 companies that are here we have it in 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.509
 15.4 points 1.10 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.450
 download and upload by idea but in that 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.100
 case I will do with my country 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.189
 I do not have it 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:48.090
 what is this we select the most 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:50.369
 recent for your country whether it is 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.930
 most recent sunrise from another country or a 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.750
 global 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.750
 let's see 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.930
 we see this side on the right side 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.150
 that does not appear and we click 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:05.250
 we will appear directly and to that part 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:07.680
 and shakespeare already m of 1904 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.130
 let's understand opening a place and start 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.130
 to download 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.800
 we only want to save it 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.960
 ah 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.810
 to start downloading 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.650
 although I have not finished downloading 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.650
 and warnes will appear without message 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.470
 let's go even 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:49.069
 finished 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.069
 programs and we do not live where we keep 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.350
 the firmware that always appears 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.810
 the firmware that we just downloaded 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.489
 then the savador to the next step is 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.450
 turn it into a point 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.950
 efe to raise it then we are going to 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.720
 stick it 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.700
 in 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.260
 folder on this plastic to be signed 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.260
 here we are going to stick it 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.920
 although once stuck 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.110
 the folder 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.440
 we believe in bioware then we go to 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.680
 going out to open the tur also I have 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.680
 left 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:43.490
 although this program is not close anymore 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.620
 then to convert 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.560
 to convert this firmware that does not 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:52.100
 downloaded from the spirit award for 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.090
 convert it to an ftp point / 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.090
 let's do the following 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:02.510
 the program tells us that we go in the 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.879
 creation 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.590
 we select and then here they 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:08.510
 they ask the folder we are going to look for 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.989
 select the folder that we have 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.989
 saved 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.420
 we go where we save the firmware and 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.420
 we select it 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:24.250
 and we are already accepting 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:27.130
 and here all the files will appear 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.590
 that we are going to put on this side to 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.890
 turn them into ft point 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.310
 but well here we are going to fill in this not 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:38.610
 It is a copy 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.720
 30 let's place we hope the name 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.320
 here davis 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.320
 lidia m 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.340
 the version that would be this 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.630
 let's leave like this 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.100
 then it is no longer good you can 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.380
 put nothing good meat place 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:11.320
 he calls them from each one then 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.529
 we select all we criticize the 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.830
 Patera chairs 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:18.000
 each 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:21.620
 I dont know 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.620
 pass them from both sides 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:32.300
 once we have here shows us 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:34.610
 we have everything ready and we give in creating 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.389
 and we will start to create our point of 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.389
 efe people 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.290
 do not wait until it is completed 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:57.949
 ok we see that it has been completed 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:00.190
 is the creation boom finish that has already 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:04.100
 has finished creating the fdf point 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:06.090
 we go to firmware 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:09.150
 as we see here 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:11.260
 I would say 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.270
 in 1904 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.230
 the compilation and the name created 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.480
 concentrate on gsm 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:20.900
 here is our pivot and you're ready 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:23.060
 to begin with, that would be all for 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.610
 to download our latest type 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.690
 with a spy program firmware and 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.920
 turn it into a point 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.630
 efe 

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.720
 so you can download that had more 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:35.870
 receive for your mobile so you do not have 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:38.540
 looking on the internet for a link that does not 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.850
 it works and you have created justin.tv 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.560
 pt I hope you liked it 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:46.090
 have doubts or questions do not doubt 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.090
 ask that I answer
