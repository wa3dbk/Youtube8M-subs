00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:26.150
 other actors of shackle 93 and the n 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.570
 103 develop respectively 95 and 110 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.970
 horses 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.970
 these two tractors or for purpose of 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.920
 meet the target breeding targets 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.360
 municipality as well as the target 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.280
 forest with equipment 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.400
 specific to cabins 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.650
 especially his two tractors the n 93 and 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.420
 n 103 are provided with a new 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.970
 motorization so we are faithful to 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.129
 the motorization aco power an engine so 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.370
 made in finland and finally develop 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.950
 in also its two engines so 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.920
 are three- cylinder engines 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.980
 to meet the third 4 interim lamp 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.380
 we used an egr valve 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.690
 so for cold 10 hours and then a 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.540
 dock so to neutralize as well 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.190
 the nox that particles in terms of 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.649
 front chassis now we have 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.899
 picked up what worked well so 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:16.369
 with the biggest models namely a 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:18.500
 frame 10 years wasp waist 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.810
 so allowing us to develop a 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.450
 optimal steering and therefore to make it a 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.789
 very agile tractor for small 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.490
 livestock farms and the 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:30.130
 municipalities or even the forests this 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.149
 tractor as you can see 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.399
 also has a new design 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.020
 drawing heavily on what you 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.000
 already know with more models 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.190
 strong power of the series n so a 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.679
 design that I think is I'm sure 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.759
 will please everyone now if we speak 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:47.000
 a little bit of transmission 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.740
 these two tractors are equipped with two 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.149
 transmission high tech transmission 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.450
 transmission you also know 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.679
 since it exists in valtra since 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.020
 a few weeks a few years 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.310
 now forgive and then the 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.690
 high tech transmission 5 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.330
 a transmission we have 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.509
 the immense honor of presenting in March 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.619
 last so in France as well as in the 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.929
 rest of europe 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.789
 this transmission was 5 allows 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.190
 to offer today an alternative 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.990
 interesting for customers in 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.900
 search for comfort 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.850
 but also enhanced ergonomics 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.650
 some new introductions 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.420
 including the cabin suspension that 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.950
 is now available on these little ones 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.120
 tractors which was not yet the 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.130
 case so far 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.830
 and as I said equipment 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:35.740
 very specific, particularly at the level of 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:39.350
 cabins since besides the fact so two 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:42.710
 the choice of the standard cabin which 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.490
 meet the breeding targets as well as 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.380
 polyculture farming 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.140
 we will have the cabin 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.990
 municipality a cabin so developing 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.030
 a window provided by donating a window 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.790
 lateral polycarbonate uplink 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.640
 nor through a forest cabin so 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.590
 with a glazed roof to allow so 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.290
 a use a forgiveness use 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.210
 in the forest optimally to that we 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.880
 add a post to pay for 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:10.460
 work so I will say at best and at 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.070
 closer so 2 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.290
 from what we have to do and then 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.090
 to finish the municipality cabin more 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.290
 which takes over both 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.780
 cabin features 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.400
 municipality and the forest cabin 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.950
 a Kabyle ideal name for them 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.650
 uses aulas me especially if we 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.540
 we dwell on hydraulics 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.730
 now so the hydraulic resumes 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.160
 today the same characteristics 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.190
 than those of high-tech transmissions to 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.420
 know so an open center with two 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:43.370
 pump options 73 or 90 minutes 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.840
 so I hope this little girl 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.790
 presentation will let you know 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.110
 a little bit more about this series she 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.970
 is notably his two small models 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:55.010
 which have been designed to satisfy as 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.450
 I was saying all the targets that I 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.790
 just mentioned a few moments ago 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.700
 the key word for this Syrian is 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.340
 of course the versatility since the 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.080
 target and all targets search 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.900
 foremost with this type of tractors from 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.370
 small dimensions a versatile offer 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.270
 and a versatile product 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.270
 I thank you
