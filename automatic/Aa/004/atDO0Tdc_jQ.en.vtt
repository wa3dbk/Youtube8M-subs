00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.610
 the young game by the board of directors 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:47.410
 support you have given us is tremendous last night 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.690
 they made a big effort to bring us 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.570
 to concentrate here is the asking santiago 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.100
 they agreed and that shows that the 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.160
 directory is not only fixed in the first 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:01.469
 team but you're putting all your 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.469
 energy all your future in what little 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.690
 yes of course I talked to the ones like you 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.580
 I said earlier with the players 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.520
 we have had four challenges that 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.170
 they were the two bad championships of the brand 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.000
 kia very soft and the nike glass that we do not 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.970
 has played so far we have already fulfilled 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.800
 1 but we do not want to keep that 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.310
 we have a lot of hope in this litter 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.030
 of players so I think it's going to give 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.030
 very long fruit 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.640
 well well I also always wear 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.800
 goals I do not like to mark space I think 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.260
 that I have gone step by step 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.200
 I have been very meticulous in what I am 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:44.080
 doing I did not want to hurry me 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.310
 I have a future goal that I want 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.890
 fulfill but 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.630
 quietly hunger very context 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.060
 the truth that very happy and we 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.380
 illusion because we have tried to 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.799
 doing things well in young soccer 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.060
 and this special generation is a 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.710
 generation that we feel is very very 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.549
 good have always been very thoughtful in 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.110
 them and it 's very rewarding to achieve a 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.410
 title like this one winning 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.489
 I believe that in general all 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.590
 missions but our masters now 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.870
 we are quite competitive I would say that 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.340
 created in almost the entire series and nothing and 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.220
 to achieve a good title is to sing 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.890

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.010
