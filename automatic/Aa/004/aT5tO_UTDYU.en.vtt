simple<00:00:38.520> kit<00:00:38.730> from<00:00:39.420> eBay<00:00:39.780> for<00:00:40.260> about<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.559> think

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
simple kit from eBay for about I think

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.160 
simple kit from eBay for about I think
it<00:00:41.070> was<00:00:41.190> like<00:00:41.370> seven<00:00:42.090> dollars<00:00:42.210> shipped<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.020> my

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.970 
it was like seven dollars shipped to my
door<00:00:43.579> so<00:00:44.579> um<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:46.289> know<00:00:46.379> there's<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.620> lot<00:00:46.770> more

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
door so um you know there's a lot more

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.439 
door so um you know there's a lot more
tools<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.670> comes<00:00:47.910> with<00:00:49.969> but<00:00:50.969> obviously

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
tools that it comes with but obviously

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.319 
tools that it comes with but obviously
for<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:51.870> one<00:00:52.140> it's<00:00:52.739> rather<00:00:52.949> simple<00:00:53.329> you're

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
for this one it's rather simple you're

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.779 
for this one it's rather simple you're
not<00:00:54.420> going<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.629> need<00:00:54.719> much<00:00:55.280> for<00:00:56.280> most<00:00:56.430> modern

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
not going to need much for most modern

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:57.860 
not going to need much for most modern
watches<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.390> probably<00:00:57.629> don't<00:00:57.780> need

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
watches you probably don't need

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.170 
watches you probably don't need
something<00:00:58.079> like<00:00:58.289> this<00:00:59.000> which<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.030> pretty

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
something like this which is pretty

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.400 
something like this which is pretty
simple

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
simple

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.039 
simple
is<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:02.579> uh<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:03.480> first<00:01:03.600> thing<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.870> want<00:01:04.019> to

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
is that uh the first thing you want to

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.850 
is that uh the first thing you want to
do<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.320> want<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.470> find<00:01:04.680> out<00:01:06.439> which<00:01:07.439> way<00:01:07.710> the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
do is you want to find out which way the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.440 
do is you want to find out which way the
pins<00:01:08.100> go<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:09.200> from<00:01:10.310> for<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.490> watch<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:12.180> goes

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
pins go in from for this watch it goes

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.530 
pins go in from for this watch it goes
from<00:01:13.159> from<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.250> left<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.820> right<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.420> it's

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
from from the left to the right so it's

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.580 
from from the left to the right so it's
going<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.720> come<00:01:15.960> from<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:16.680> way<00:01:16.890> out<00:01:17.340> here<00:01:17.820> and

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
going to come from this way out here and

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.020 
going to come from this way out here and
obviously<00:01:19.590> what<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:19.920> would<00:01:20.070> what<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:20.880> would

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
obviously what you would what you would

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.969 
obviously what you would what you would
do<00:01:21.270> would<00:01:21.960> be<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.700> position<00:01:23.700> your<00:01:23.820> watch<00:01:24.030> on

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
do would be to position your watch on

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.300 
do would be to position your watch on
here<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.159> twist<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.710> the<00:01:28.710> pin<00:01:28.950> will<00:01:29.100> shoot

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
here and twist and the pin will shoot

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.330 
here and twist and the pin will shoot
through<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.640> way<00:01:31.189> for<00:01:32.189> other<00:01:32.340> different

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
through that way for other different

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.830 
through that way for other different
different<00:01:35.340> style<00:01:35.579> watches<00:01:36.119> from<00:01:36.270> older<00:01:36.630> ones

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
different style watches from older ones

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.789 
different style watches from older ones
or<00:01:37.020> whatnot

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
or whatnot

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.740 
or whatnot
they<00:01:38.189> provide<00:01:38.460> this<00:01:38.549> little<00:01:38.790> block<00:01:39.030> which<00:01:39.479> you

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
they provide this little block which you

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.740 
they provide this little block which you
would<00:01:40.320> basically<00:01:42.680> set<00:01:43.680> your<00:01:43.890> watch<00:01:44.040> down<00:01:44.369> and

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
would basically set your watch down and

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.450 
would basically set your watch down and
there's<00:01:45.750> different<00:01:45.960> types<00:01:46.170> sizes<00:01:46.649> punches

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
there's different types sizes punches

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.039 
there's different types sizes punches
punches<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:48.689> would<00:01:48.810> use<00:01:49.399> in<00:01:50.399> order<00:01:50.610> to

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
punches that you would use in order to

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.899 
punches that you would use in order to
basically<00:01:52.049> find<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:53.100> right<00:01:53.280> size<00:01:53.549> and

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
basically find the the right size and

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.730 
basically find the the right size and
then<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:55.380> would<00:01:55.530> take<00:01:55.850> a<00:01:56.850> hammer<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.079> then

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
then you would take a hammer and then

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.130 
then you would take a hammer and then
you<00:01:58.890> would<00:01:59.040> just<00:01:59.070> tap<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.850> on<00:01:59.969> top<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.600> push<00:02:00.899> the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
you would just tap it on top to push the

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.709 
you would just tap it on top to push the
pin<00:02:01.320> through<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:03.560> basically<00:02:05.090> reassemble<00:02:06.090> as

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
pin through and basically reassemble as

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.290 
pin through and basically reassemble as
planned<00:02:07.580> well<00:02:08.580> obviously<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:09.060> first<00:02:09.090> thing

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
planned well obviously the first thing

it's<00:02:29.209> adjustable<00:02:29.780> up<00:02:30.019> to<00:02:30.110> three<00:02:30.410> levels<00:02:30.680> so

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
it's adjustable up to three levels so

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.240 
it's adjustable up to three levels so
you<00:02:31.370> can<00:02:31.489> make<00:02:31.790> a<00:02:31.819> little<00:02:32.150> finer<00:02:32.510> adjustments

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
you can make a little finer adjustments

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.900 
you can make a little finer adjustments
right<00:02:34.250> here<00:02:34.459> in<00:02:34.550> the<00:02:34.640> class<00:02:35.170> so<00:02:36.910> fortunately

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
right here in the class so fortunately

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.900 
right here in the class so fortunately
for<00:02:38.060> mine<00:02:38.269> I<00:02:38.540> could<00:02:39.319> just<00:02:39.470> use<00:02:39.730> something<00:02:40.730> as

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910

for mine I could just use something as
simple<00:02:41.180> as<00:02:41.390> as<00:02:42.319> this<00:02:42.920> tool<00:02:43.220> to<00:02:43.760> remove<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.209> pin

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
simple as as this tool to remove the pin

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.240 
simple as as this tool to remove the pin
basically<00:02:47.060> right<00:02:47.239> here<00:02:47.269> where<00:02:47.569> to<00:02:47.660> twist<00:02:49.180> and

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
basically right here where to twist and

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.360 
basically right here where to twist and
you<00:02:52.250> would<00:02:52.400> see<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:53.900> pin<00:02:54.200> come<00:02:54.890> out<00:02:55.040> from<00:02:55.280> the

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
you would see the pin come out from the

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.210 
you would see the pin come out from the
other<00:02:55.489> side<00:02:56.590> okay<00:02:57.590> and<00:02:57.829> then<00:02:57.980> you<00:02:58.099> would

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
other side okay and then you would

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:08.620 
other side okay and then you would
retract<00:02:58.549> it<00:03:05.950> you<00:03:06.950> see<00:03:07.190> and<00:03:07.549> either<00:03:08.150> you<00:03:08.480> would

or<00:03:13.299> there<00:03:14.299> are<00:03:14.510> some<00:03:15.280> simple<00:03:16.280> neon<00:03:16.549> those

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
or there are some simple neon those

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.229 
or there are some simple neon those
pliers<00:03:16.970> that<00:03:17.060> you<00:03:17.269> can<00:03:17.450> use<00:03:17.720> to<00:03:18.970> remove<00:03:19.970> the

pliers that you can use to remove the

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.940 
pliers that you can use to remove the
pin<00:03:20.480> from<00:03:21.410> right<00:03:21.590> here<00:03:22.750> right<00:03:23.750> there<00:03:23.989> and<00:03:24.230> then

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
pin from right here right there and then

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.250 
pin from right here right there and then
they<00:03:25.609> click<00:03:25.880> the<00:03:26.180> class<00:03:26.420> which<00:03:26.690> is<00:03:26.840> fall<00:03:27.019> apart

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
they click the class which is fall apart

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.800 
they click the class which is fall apart
like<00:03:27.380> that<00:03:27.609> okay<00:03:28.609> what<00:03:29.420> you<00:03:29.510> want<00:03:29.660> to<00:03:29.720> also

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
like that okay what you want to also

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.140 
like that okay what you want to also
want<00:03:30.109> to<00:03:30.139> do<00:03:30.380> is<00:03:30.650> you<00:03:31.370> want<00:03:31.519> to<00:03:31.549> make<00:03:31.730> sure<00:03:31.760> that

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
want to do is you want to make sure that

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.039 
want to do is you want to make sure that
you<00:03:32.560> remember<00:03:33.560> which<00:03:33.799> way<00:03:34.579> the<00:03:35.180> pin<00:03:35.389> is<00:03:35.569> the

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
you remember which way the pin is the

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:36.759 
you remember which way the pin is the
pin<00:03:36.260> goes<00:03:36.440> through

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
pin goes through

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.720 
pin goes through
so<00:03:37.549> obviously<00:03:38.120> one<00:03:39.049> end<00:03:39.290> is<00:03:39.530> a<00:03:39.560> little<00:03:40.160> bit

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
so obviously one end is a little bit

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:47.140 
so obviously one end is a little bit
more<00:03:41.200> mushroomed<00:03:42.200> out<00:03:42.350> than<00:03:42.950> this<00:03:43.190> end<00:03:43.519> so<00:03:46.150> or

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
more mushroomed out than this end so or

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.370 
more mushroomed out than this end so or
the<00:03:47.299> second<00:03:47.569> part<00:03:47.720> of<00:03:47.810> this<00:03:47.930> is<00:03:48.170> that

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
the second part of this is that

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.879 
the second part of this is that
basically<00:03:49.250> to<00:03:49.459> put<00:03:49.639> it<00:03:49.760> back<00:03:49.910> together<00:03:50.889> since

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:51.889 
basically to put it back together since

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:57.009 
basically to put it back together since
the<00:03:52.100> pin<00:03:52.340> width<00:03:52.579> from<00:03:53.450> up<00:03:53.720> from<00:03:54.109> here<00:03:54.620> up<00:03:56.019> what

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
the pin width from up from here up what

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:59.110 
the pin width from up from here up what
you<00:03:57.170> want<00:03:57.349> to<00:03:57.410> do<00:03:57.590> is<00:03:57.889> the<00:03:58.190> reverse<00:03:58.549> order<00:03:58.880> so

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
you want to do is the reverse order so

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.199 
you want to do is the reverse order so
you're<00:03:59.239> going<00:03:59.359> to<00:03:59.389> insert<00:03:59.690> it<00:03:59.900> that<00:04:00.590> way<00:04:01.209> okay

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
you're going to insert it that way okay

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.900 
you're going to insert it that way okay
and<00:04:03.109> then<00:04:03.260> you<00:04:03.380> push<00:04:03.650> it<00:04:03.799> down<00:04:03.829> and<00:04:04.400> there's<00:04:04.849> a

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
and then you push it down and there's a

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.309 
and then you push it down and there's a
little<00:04:05.060> nub<00:04:05.420> right<00:04:05.569> here<00:04:05.900> that's<00:04:06.109> still

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
little nub right here that's still

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:08.680 
little nub right here that's still
sticking<00:04:06.650> out<00:04:06.799> what<00:04:07.760> you're<00:04:07.940> going<00:04:08.060> to<00:04:08.090> do<00:04:08.359> is

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
sticking out what you're going to do is

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.650 
sticking out what you're going to do is
you're<00:04:08.989> going<00:04:09.079> to<00:04:09.139> take<00:04:09.349> this<00:04:10.269> watch<00:04:11.269> hammer

and you're going to put it in like that

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.959 
and you're going to put it in like that
this<00:04:33.650> is<00:04:33.770> where<00:04:33.949> the<00:04:34.039> punch<00:04:34.280> comes<00:04:34.550> into<00:04:34.789> play

00:04:34.959 --> 00:04:34.969 
this is where the punch comes into play

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:37.529 
this is where the punch comes into play
as<00:04:35.030> well<00:04:35.270> so<00:04:35.719> you<00:04:35.810> want<00:04:36.020> to<00:04:36.080> make<00:04:36.710> it<00:04:36.860> sit<00:04:37.099> flush

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
as well so you want to make it sit flush

just basically tap it in until it goes

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.420 
just basically tap it in until it goes
down<00:04:45.229> into<00:04:46.219> it<00:04:46.370> so<00:04:46.969> there<00:04:47.659> you<00:04:47.780> go<00:04:48.430> pretty

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
down into it so there you go pretty

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.909 
down into it so there you go pretty
simple<00:04:51.009> pretty<00:04:52.009> simple<00:04:52.219> to<00:04:52.550> get<00:04:53.620> to<00:04:54.620> basically

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919 
simple pretty simple to get to basically

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:57.510 
simple pretty simple to get to basically
do<00:04:55.219> takes<00:04:55.909> less<00:04:56.180> than<00:04:56.330> a<00:04:56.449> couple<00:04:56.689> of<00:04:56.750> minutes

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
do takes less than a couple of minutes

do takes less than a couple of minutes
and<00:04:58.520> yeah<00:04:59.150> and<00:04:59.389> so<00:04:59.719> instead<00:04:59.960> of<00:05:00.110> paying<00:05:00.259> attend

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
and yeah and so instead of paying attend
