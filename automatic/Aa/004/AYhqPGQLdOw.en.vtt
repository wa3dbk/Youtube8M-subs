00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello there are ideas for you again 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.259
 the editorial 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.830
 I wish you much fun 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.830
 look at 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:20.010
 I'll show you the difference today 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:24.420
 from tunisian basic pattern to half 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:27.900
 Strictly engraving one sees here at 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:33.079
 basic patterns are two such transverse 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:36.390
 threads while holding strictly only one 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:39.290
 the human image is here as well 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.420
 a little firmer than the basic pattern 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.149
 This stitch is worked as follows 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.300
 you do not work at the beginning either 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:52.110
 air to make catches not only here 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.379
 but in this bend also still 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.829
 on the needle around the loop through 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.829
 pick up 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.370
 and at the end then from the last one 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:38.250
 sling one sling one at a time 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:40.500
 work an additional air mass and 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.210
 it goes back as usual always two 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.210
 make a loop together 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.930
 that's half the way I sting 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.930
 I wish you a lot of fun with it
