was<00:05:12.300> going<00:05:12.450> to<00:05:12.480> get<00:05:12.600> a<00:05:12.660> side<00:05:12.870> salad<00:05:13.140> but<00:05:13.760> all<00:05:14.760> of

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
was going to get a side salad but all of

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.110 
was going to get a side salad but all of
the<00:05:15.300> side<00:05:15.479> salad<00:05:15.930> dressings<00:05:16.440> had<00:05:16.830> either<00:05:17.310> milk

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
the side salad dressings had either milk

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.750 
the side salad dressings had either milk
or<00:05:18.510> sugar<00:05:18.540> or<00:05:19.440> vinegar<00:05:19.770> or<00:05:20.160> something<00:05:20.520> in<00:05:20.639> it

or sugar or vinegar or something in it

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.940 
or sugar or vinegar or something in it
so<00:05:20.910> i<00:05:20.940> just<00:05:21.180> opted<00:05:22.020> for<00:05:22.260> the<00:05:22.290> rice<00:05:22.560> in<00:05:22.860> the

so i just opted for the rice in the
broccoli<00:05:23.400> but<00:05:23.729> it<00:05:23.820> was<00:05:23.910> good<00:05:24.979> definitely

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
broccoli but it was good definitely

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:28.670 
broccoli but it was good definitely
difficult<00:05:26.250> to<00:05:26.760> not<00:05:26.970> eat<00:05:27.360> the<00:05:28.140> BBQ<00:05:28.320> butter
