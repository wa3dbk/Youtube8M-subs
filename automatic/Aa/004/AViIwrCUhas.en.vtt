00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.060 
for the antenna wire in the middle okay
I<00:01:00.670> took<00:01:01.670> a<00:01:02.000> quickly<00:01:02.539> looking<00:01:03.199> the<00:01:03.410> car<00:01:03.739> before

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
I took a quickly looking the car before

I took a quickly looking the car before
make<00:01:05.000> the<00:01:05.239> video<00:01:05.680> but<00:01:06.680> I<00:01:06.830> didn't<00:01:07.220> open<00:01:07.700> it<00:01:08.060> yet

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
make the video but I didn't open it yet

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:15.510

I<00:01:08.689> did<00:01:09.110> not<00:01:09.229> remove<00:01:09.590> it<00:01:09.650> with<00:01:12.729> the<00:01:13.729> shell<00:01:14.030> so

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
I did not remove it with the shell so

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.370 
I did not remove it with the shell so
it's<00:01:16.520> a<00:01:16.580> nice<00:01:16.760> shell<00:01:17.119> it's<00:01:17.479> covered<00:01:17.960> with<00:01:17.990> a

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
it's a nice shell it's covered with a

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:25.060 
it's a nice shell it's covered with a
plastic<00:01:19.689> that<00:01:20.689> we<00:01:20.869> you<00:01:21.049> can<00:01:21.080> remove<00:01:22.270> so<00:01:23.920> in<00:01:24.920> a

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
plastic that we you can remove so in a

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:32.469 
plastic that we you can remove so in a
quick<00:01:25.310> look<00:01:29.799> in<00:01:30.799> a<00:01:30.950> quick<00:01:31.130> look<00:01:31.340> I<00:01:31.520> I<00:01:31.759> saw<00:01:32.180> that

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
quick look in a quick look I I saw that

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.520 
quick look in a quick look I I saw that
the<00:01:33.159> the<00:01:34.159> here<00:01:34.939> actually<00:01:35.240> and<00:01:35.960> the<00:01:36.200> front

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
the the here actually and the front

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.399 
the the here actually and the front
actually<00:01:37.250> are<00:01:37.549> done<00:01:37.909> by<00:01:38.299> plastic<00:01:38.960> as<00:01:39.110> you<00:01:39.229> can

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
actually are done by plastic as you can

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.830 
actually are done by plastic as you can
see<00:01:39.590> there<00:01:39.799> so<00:01:40.040> I<00:01:40.880> don't<00:01:41.150> know<00:01:41.240> if<00:01:41.420> this<00:01:41.689> will

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
see there so I don't know if this will

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.719 
see there so I don't know if this will
be<00:01:41.900> stronger<00:01:42.710> enough<00:01:43.040> for<00:01:43.579> this<00:01:43.790> kind<00:01:44.060> of<00:01:44.150> car

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
be stronger enough for this kind of car

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.330 
be stronger enough for this kind of car
these<00:01:46.729> shots<00:01:47.119> are<00:01:47.450> like<00:01:47.930> I<00:01:48.409> don't<00:01:48.799> know<00:01:49.159> it's

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
these shots are like I don't know it's

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.310 
these shots are like I don't know it's
fragile<00:01:49.930> to<00:01:50.930> me<00:01:50.960> it's<00:01:51.290> not<00:01:51.970> resonant<00:01:53.320> but

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
fragile to me it's not resonant but

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.179 
fragile to me it's not resonant but
since<00:01:54.850> nice<00:01:55.850> I<00:01:56.299> will<00:01:57.259> make<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:58.880> video<00:01:59.299> testing

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
since nice I will make the video testing

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.990 
since nice I will make the video testing
the<00:02:01.189> gears<00:02:02.119> are<00:02:02.920> plastic<00:02:03.920> gears<00:02:04.250> as<00:02:04.549> you<00:02:04.820> can

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
the gears are plastic gears as you can

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.930 
the gears are plastic gears as you can
see

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.479 

it's<00:02:08.940> not<00:02:09.149> well<00:02:09.390> protected<00:02:09.690> for<00:02:10.530> off-road<00:02:11.519> car

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
it's not well protected for off-road car

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.869 
it's not well protected for off-road car
seems<00:02:14.489> a<00:02:14.730> very<00:02:15.650> simple<00:02:16.650> car<00:02:16.920> but<00:02:17.459> for<00:02:17.760> the

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
seems a very simple car but for the

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.890 
seems a very simple car but for the
price<00:02:18.120> we<00:02:18.390> can't<00:02:18.720> expect<00:02:19.170> too<00:02:19.530> much<00:02:19.970> so<00:02:20.970> that's

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
price we can't expect too much so that's

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.410 
price we can't expect too much so that's
it<00:02:22.489> I'll<00:02:23.489> make<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.819> video<00:02:25.280> with<00:02:26.280> this<00:02:26.519> car<00:02:26.879> in

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
it I'll make a video with this car in

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.449 
it I'll make a video with this car in
use<00:02:27.780> I<00:02:28.819> put<00:02:29.819> a<00:02:29.849> battery<00:02:30.209> I<00:02:31.019> put<00:02:31.769> a<00:02:31.799> receiver

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
use I put a battery I put a receiver

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.970 
use I put a battery I put a receiver
this<00:02:32.940> good<00:02:33.180> because<00:02:33.330> has<00:02:33.569> a<00:02:33.599> space<00:02:34.500> here<00:02:34.799> to

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
this good because has a space here to

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.280 
this good because has a space here to
put<00:02:35.129> a<00:02:35.160> receiver<00:02:35.610> a<00:02:35.730> beta<00:02:36.060> checker<00:02:36.660> you<00:02:37.110> can

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
put a receiver a beta checker you can

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.740 
put a receiver a beta checker you can
put<00:02:37.470> receiver<00:02:37.980> here<00:02:38.450> for<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.840> I<00:02:40.079> don't<00:02:40.470> know

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
put receiver here for you I don't know

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.870 
put receiver here for you I don't know
