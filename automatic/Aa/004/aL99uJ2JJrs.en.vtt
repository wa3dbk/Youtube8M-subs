you can't see the hair tie and then what

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.200 
you can't see the hair tie and then what
you're<00:04:59.530> going<00:04:59.680> to<00:04:59.740> do<00:04:59.920> is<00:05:00.100> just<00:05:00.310> take<00:05:00.550> strands

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
you're going to do is just take strands

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.590 
you're going to do is just take strands
of<00:05:01.300> your<00:05:01.510> hair<00:05:01.570> and<00:05:03.120> you're<00:05:04.120> going<00:05:04.240> to<00:05:04.300> curl
