 beatbox gaddafi latvian with mike and 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.060
 also in the studio 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:34.140
 we are presenting five apps five games 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:35.880
 and for ios android exactly the first 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.520
 I want to introduce you today 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.770
 is called monument valley and is like that 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.219
 a kind of puzzle game because it's yours 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.129
 task is always with such a person 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.289
 to hear the end of the level 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.120
 now first quite easy to but 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.649
 it gets pretty tricky i show 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.239
 i just do it here i can do this 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.070
 element of the invite you for example 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.680
 move and then down here on the 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.539
 button and the special thing about it 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.270
 The game is very strong 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.369
 works with optical illusions and 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.070
 must often think in dimensions her 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.130
 actually totally untypical untypical 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.409
 are to solve all the puzzles and 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.479
 demonstrate that too and run 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.820
 her over on the flop because what now 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.689
 happened that this part here after 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.150
 moves up 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.650
 and now as soon as you are ok 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.720
 the devil I should now up there ans 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.979
 arrive when the tower is up 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.600
 but the funny thing is i 'm going to be 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.210
 Now here's turning by one 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.280
 optical illusion here a transition and 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.470
 I can still reach the goal and stuff 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.090
 It is designed overall game is 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.850
 always tricky and over again 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.770
 how cool is the net? 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.180
 the graphic style works too 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.490
 very cool it gives a very soothing 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.079
 music atmosphere and all in one 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.770
 I like the easy games real 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.780
 really good 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.850
 the next game for you in the offer 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.130
 has look and the game principle 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.500
 is super fast explained to draw 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.840
 a black line and the shape you 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.920
 Repeats itself always goal is it 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.530
 there 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.299
 every few points it would take 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.729
 even more complicated than it 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.320
 enter black holes comes into play 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.020
 swallow our line that they had to 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.730
 clever shapes are superior to the one 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.940
 but you come to the colored point ran 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.080
 just the black holes let it out 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.030
 becomes even clearer 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.480
 more complicated for example here one 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.180
 map full of black holes or level 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.980
 17 looks like this when we are here now 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.040
 this shape is wiped indeed 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.480
 these three points usually but one 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.980
 dont catch him im coming down so well 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.690
 have to think about how to get there 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.610
 there and if I do not have them here 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.069
 continues to draw down then she goes 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.500
 is still on then she goes there then 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.880
 continue down and such small 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.549
 games, I just think ingenious 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.830
 gameplay super easy but you can 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.510
 nevertheless a lot of brainwash and 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.600
 By doing so I fight the level 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.580
 I'm currently at level 28 and it will be 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.410
 then more complicated and here is in 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.970
 to paint the solution with a cross 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.549
 then go down there again and 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.250
 past the black and then right 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:04.260
 get out my ladies and gentlemen I stand 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.359
 totally playful the game what I give you 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.950
 want to show is called communicates gp2 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:10.320
 and that's a game we're in with 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.239
 jetskis drive around and race 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.680
 can run race can not race 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.910
 against the time there are different 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.560
 career model different 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.359
 difficulty levels there are very very 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.670
 many different jetskis you can do 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.530
 can where you can buy whatever money 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.209
 but of course not all that 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.120
 can earn that its now a 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.350
 time racing and yes and now we have 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.609
 Here we have to try one 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.299
 certain time this round too 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.760
 complete 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.290
 you see there is nitro there is 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.120
 jumps on the man tricks 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.620
 and can do it again, so to speak 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.540
 nitro can earn 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.100
 the graphics settings are very 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.269
 so varied for each device is what 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.650
 and it's just fun and fun 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.090
 a small amount of money you get that 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.549
