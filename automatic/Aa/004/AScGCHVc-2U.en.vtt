cherry<00:01:10.119> gum<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:11.650> me<00:01:11.799> the<00:01:12.009> cherry<00:01:12.310> is<00:01:13.030> clearly

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
cherry gum to me the cherry is clearly

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.990 
cherry gum to me the cherry is clearly
not<00:01:13.990> as<00:01:14.259> strong<00:01:14.290> as<00:01:14.890> that<00:01:14.920> strawberry<00:01:15.640> flavor

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
not as strong as that strawberry flavor

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.749 
not as strong as that strawberry flavor
with<00:01:16.420> the<00:01:16.570> other<00:01:16.750> one<00:01:16.990> this<00:01:17.829> is<00:01:18.070> still<00:01:18.340> a<00:01:18.369> very

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
with the other one this is still a very

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:21.870 
with the other one this is still a very
good<00:01:19.090> gum<00:01:19.380> but<00:01:20.380> i<00:01:20.409> would<00:01:20.530> say<00:01:20.890> clearly<00:01:21.400> that<00:01:21.579> de

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
good gum but i would say clearly that de

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.170 
good gum but i would say clearly that de
strawberry<00:01:22.920> starburst<00:01:23.920> is<00:01:24.220> better<00:01:24.610> than<00:01:25.030> the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
strawberry starburst is better than the

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.149 
strawberry starburst is better than the
cherry<00:01:25.479> so<00:01:25.869> pretty<00:01:26.140> much<00:01:26.229> you're<00:01:26.799> getting

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
cherry so pretty much you're getting

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:28.969 
cherry so pretty much you're getting
more<00:01:27.310> flavor<00:01:27.700> with<00:01:28.030> the<00:01:28.119> strawberry<00:01:28.600> flavor

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
more flavor with the strawberry flavor

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.450 
more flavor with the strawberry flavor
the<00:01:29.979> cherry<00:01:30.280> is<00:01:30.520> still<00:01:30.880> very<00:01:31.149> good<00:01:31.740> but<00:01:32.740> it

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
the cherry is still very good but it

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.789 
the cherry is still very good but it
just<00:01:33.759> seems<00:01:34.030> like<00:01:34.119> the<00:01:34.420> strawberry<00:01:34.799> it's

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
just seems like the strawberry it's

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:38.969 
just seems like the strawberry it's
better<00:01:36.420> just<00:01:37.420> i<00:01:37.899> would<00:01:38.200> say<00:01:38.380> a<00:01:38.409> little<00:01:38.740> bit

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
better just i would say a little bit

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.039 
better just i would say a little bit
better<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:41.100> again<00:01:42.450> still<00:01:43.450> it's<00:01:43.659> a<00:01:43.750> very<00:01:43.960> good

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
better so again still it's a very good

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:48.270 
better so again still it's a very good

winner with both brands is clearly the

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.249 
winner with both brands is clearly the
strawberry<00:02:03.340> but<00:02:04.180> this<00:02:04.360> is<00:02:04.509> still<00:02:04.600> a<00:02:04.750> very<00:02:05.020> good
