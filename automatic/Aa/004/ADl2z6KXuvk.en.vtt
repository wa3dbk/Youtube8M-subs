00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.129 

so<00:00:06.790> do<00:00:06.879> you<00:00:06.970> think<00:00:07.180> sometimes<00:00:07.660> leading<00:00:08.020> on

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:08.139 
so do you think sometimes leading on

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:10.770 
so do you think sometimes leading on
from<00:00:08.170> there<00:00:08.590> do<00:00:09.309> you<00:00:09.400> think<00:00:09.459> that<00:00:09.789> things<00:00:10.510> do

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:10.780 
from there do you think that things do

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.359 
from there do you think that things do
get<00:00:10.959> a<00:00:11.020> little<00:00:11.139> bit<00:00:11.350> over<00:00:11.650> complicated

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:12.369 
get a little bit over complicated

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:13.980 
get a little bit over complicated
because<00:00:12.490> sometimes<00:00:13.029> the<00:00:13.209> most<00:00:13.240> standard<00:00:13.869> of

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:13.990 
because sometimes the most standard of

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.380 
because sometimes the most standard of
rigs<00:00:14.260> work<00:00:14.529> the<00:00:14.709> most<00:00:14.889> don't<00:00:15.219> I<00:00:15.459> I<00:00:15.820> think<00:00:16.150> it's

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.240 

I've<00:00:19.390> seen<00:00:19.660> people<00:00:20.050> with<00:00:20.080> too<00:00:20.410> many<00:00:20.530> beads<00:00:20.890> and

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
I've seen people with too many beads and

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.640 
I've seen people with too many beads and
bits<00:00:21.430> and<00:00:21.550> meta<00:00:21.790> long<00:00:22.030> and<00:00:22.360> clumsy<00:00:23.320> stuff<00:00:23.530> is

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
bits and meta long and clumsy stuff is

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.590 
bits and meta long and clumsy stuff is
dead<00:00:23.830> obvious<00:00:24.220> because<00:00:24.490> you<00:00:24.610> think<00:00:24.760> the

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:25.600 
dead obvious because you think the

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.630 
dead obvious because you think the
goddess<00:00:26.110> of<00:00:26.260> anything<00:00:26.680> else<00:00:26.920> it's<00:00:27.220> obvious

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
goddess of anything else it's obvious

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.090 
goddess of anything else it's obvious
they<00:00:27.970> can<00:00:28.150> see<00:00:28.360> it<00:00:28.480> yeah<00:00:28.960> I<00:00:29.260> think<00:00:29.740> once<00:00:30.039> you

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.100 
they can see it yeah I think once you

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.580 
they can see it yeah I think once you
got<00:00:30.280> to<00:00:30.400> that<00:00:30.520> stage<00:00:30.550> and<00:00:31.180> it's<00:00:32.169> more<00:00:32.349> things

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
got to that stage and it's more things

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.280 
got to that stage and it's more things
to<00:00:32.739> go<00:00:32.829> wrong<00:00:33.040> more<00:00:33.370> things<00:00:33.579> to<00:00:33.730> tangle<00:00:34.120> or<00:00:34.420> to

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
to go wrong more things to tangle or to

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.479 
to go wrong more things to tangle or to
hang<00:00:35.500> wrong<00:00:35.770> yeah<00:00:36.400> you<00:00:36.970> know<00:00:37.120> and<00:00:37.690> I<00:00:38.340> mean<00:00:39.340> the

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
hang wrong yeah you know and I mean the

would use in a boat or anything
so<00:03:27.329> pull<00:03:27.510> it<00:03:27.630> in<00:03:28.040> it's<00:03:29.040> a<00:03:29.160> one<00:03:29.310> rocket<00:03:29.609> in<00:03:29.700> the

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
so pull it in it's a one rocket in the

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.460 
so pull it in it's a one rocket in the
all<00:03:29.940> spooked<00:03:30.269> and<00:03:30.480> went<00:03:30.630> out<00:03:30.750> yeah

all spooked and went out yeah
and<00:03:32.370> then<00:03:32.579> I<00:03:32.940> thought<00:03:33.390> it<00:03:33.630> was<00:03:33.750> obviously<00:03:34.170> the

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
and then I thought it was obviously the

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.780 
and then I thought it was obviously the
tubing<00:03:34.799> so<00:03:34.950> I<00:03:35.010> thought<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.310> tubing<00:03:35.670> up

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
tubing so I thought the tubing up

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.910 
tubing so I thought the tubing up
because<00:03:36.780> it<00:03:36.870> was<00:03:36.989> an<00:03:37.079> underground<00:03:37.350> cast<00:03:37.739> put

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
because it was an underground cast put

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.490 
because it was an underground cast put
it<00:03:38.040> back<00:03:38.190> in<00:03:38.459> they<00:03:39.390> came<00:03:39.660> in<00:03:39.870> completely

undisturbed no problem

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.539 
undisturbed no problem
and<00:03:42.720> then<00:03:43.079> they<00:03:43.200> ought<00:03:43.290> one<00:03:43.440> of<00:03:43.560> a<00:03:43.620> little<00:03:44.340> team
