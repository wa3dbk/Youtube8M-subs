and<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.290> great<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:37.950> really<00:00:38.250> good<00:00:38.400> I<00:00:38.520> like

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
and this is great is really good I like

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.810 
and this is great is really good I like
a<00:00:38.970> little<00:00:39.150> chemistry<00:00:39.630> of<00:00:39.870> these<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.079> have<00:00:40.820> more

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
a little chemistry of these a have more

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.500 
a little chemistry of these a have more
kind<00:00:42.150> of<00:00:42.239> on<00:00:43.190> that<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.340> know<00:00:44.489> if<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.180> have<00:00:45.330> to

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
kind of on that you know if you have to

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.770 
kind of on that you know if you have to
get<00:00:45.660> out<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.140> high<00:00:46.379> range<00:00:46.710> section<00:00:50.690> and<00:00:51.690> I

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
get out of a high range section and I

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:59.420 
get out of a high range section and I
range<00:00:52.260> section<00:00:53.300> we're<00:00:54.300> going<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.510> use<00:00:58.430> helium

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
range section we're going to use helium

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.219 
range section we're going to use helium
so<00:01:00.420> when<00:01:00.570> use<00:01:00.720> the<00:01:00.750> helium<00:01:02.540> you<00:01:03.540> can<00:01:03.720> well<00:01:04.080> let

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
so when use the helium you can well let

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:12.200 
so when use the helium you can well let
me<00:01:04.259> get<00:01:04.410> a<00:01:04.440> little<00:01:04.500> bit<00:01:04.680> more<00:01:10.610> so<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.640> can<00:01:11.820> same

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
me get a little bit more so you can same

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.120 
me get a little bit more so you can same
using<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.660> helium<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.290> we'll<00:01:13.380> get<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.560> kind<00:01:14.040> of

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
using the helium so we'll get a kind of

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.420 
using the helium so we'll get a kind of
Sopranos<00:01:14.670> over<00:01:14.940> here<00:01:15.979> yeah<00:01:16.979> well<00:01:17.130> that's<00:01:17.310> one

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
Sopranos over here yeah well that's one

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.469 
Sopranos over here yeah well that's one
of<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.550> bass<00:01:17.729> people<00:01:18.240> over<00:01:18.479> here<00:01:20.360> and<00:01:21.360> this

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
of the bass people over here and this

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.749 
of the bass people over here and this
stuff<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.750> called<00:01:22.170> oh<00:01:22.470> by<00:01:22.800> the<00:01:22.830> way<00:01:22.979> when

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
stuff is called oh by the way when

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.130 
stuff is called oh by the way when
you're<00:01:23.850> seeing<00:01:24.149> your<00:01:24.330> read<00:01:24.509> your<00:01:24.750> singing

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
you're seeing your read your singing

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.660 
you're seeing your read your singing
through<00:01:25.350> air<00:01:25.649> which<00:01:26.009> does<00:01:26.220> anyone<00:01:26.430> know<00:01:26.550> the

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
through air which does anyone know the

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.430 
through air which does anyone know the
molecular<00:01:26.820> weight<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.270> air<00:01:27.450> baths<00:01:27.720> about

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
molecular weight of air baths about

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.400 
molecular weight of air baths about
thirty<00:01:28.740> about<00:01:29.340> thirty<00:01:29.670> or<00:01:29.759> so<00:01:30.090> this<00:01:30.810> stuff<00:01:31.110> has

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
thirty about thirty or so this stuff has

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.870 
thirty about thirty or so this stuff has
a<00:01:31.440> molecular<00:01:31.740> weight<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.190> helium<00:01:32.670> this

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
a molecular weight this is helium this

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.620 
a molecular weight this is helium this
has<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.060> molecular<00:01:33.240> weight<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:34.310> two<00:01:35.310> four<00:01:35.759> and

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
has a molecular weight of two four and

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.230 
has a molecular weight of two four and
so<00:01:36.930> when<00:01:37.619> sound<00:01:37.979> travels<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:38.910> travels

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
so when sound travels and it travels

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.139 
so when sound travels and it travels
will<00:01:39.420> my<00:01:40.050> video<00:01:40.470> goes<00:01:40.830> in<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.069> higher<00:01:41.250> note<00:01:41.550> well

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
will my video goes in a higher note well

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:43.760 
will my video goes in a higher note well
this<00:01:42.330> one<00:01:42.599> has<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.810> molecular<00:01:43.080> weight<00:01:43.319> of<00:01:43.500> about

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
this one has a molecular weight of about

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.999 
this one has a molecular weight of about
a<00:01:43.800> hundred<00:01:48.319> so<00:01:49.319> you<00:01:49.380> guys<00:01:49.530> are<00:01:49.679> going<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.860> sing

a hundred so you guys are going to sing

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.710 
a hundred so you guys are going to sing
with<00:01:50.160> this<00:01:50.250> into<00:01:50.580> the<00:01:50.670> baritone<00:01:51.179> you<00:01:51.360> got<00:01:51.539> over

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
with this into the baritone you got over

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:59.600 
with this into the baritone you got over
there<00:01:52.940> yeah<00:01:54.200> you<00:01:55.200> have<00:01:55.410> to<00:01:58.160> understand<00:01:59.160> this

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.370 

which<00:02:07.580> is<00:02:07.700> what<00:02:07.970> you<00:02:08.060> know<00:02:08.240> when<00:02:08.929> you<00:02:09.050> do<00:02:09.200> the

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
which is what you know when you do the

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.430 
which is what you know when you do the
base<00:02:09.560> codes<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:11.090> helium<00:02:11.569> washing<00:02:11.990> rises<00:02:12.350> up

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
base codes the helium washing rises up

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.960 
base codes the helium washing rises up
in<00:02:12.560> your<00:02:12.650> lungs<00:02:12.860> and<00:02:13.280> float<00:02:13.700> away

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
in your lungs and float away
