my<00:00:05.430> name<00:00:05.580> is<00:00:05.700> Thompson<00:00:06.000> Clark<00:00:06.390> I<00:00:06.600> am<00:00:06.779> 14<00:00:07.230> years

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
my name is Thompson Clark I am 14 years

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.650 
my name is Thompson Clark I am 14 years
old<00:00:07.589> and<00:00:07.859> I<00:00:08.099> started<00:00:08.400> cubing<00:00:08.820> three<00:00:09.240> years<00:00:09.510> ago

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
old and I started cubing three years ago

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.080 
old and I started cubing three years ago
when<00:00:10.080> my<00:00:10.559> brother<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:10.980> I<00:00:11.040> both<00:00:11.250> got<00:00:11.550> a<00:00:11.790> Rubik's

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
when my brother and I both got a Rubik's

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.480 
when my brother and I both got a Rubik's
Cube<00:00:12.360> for<00:00:12.540> Christmas<00:00:12.960> I<00:00:13.139> felt<00:00:13.469> challenged<00:00:14.160> to

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
Cube for Christmas I felt challenged to

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.709 
Cube for Christmas I felt challenged to
solve<00:00:14.730> it<00:00:14.880> before<00:00:15.000> him<00:00:15.360> just<00:00:15.599> because

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
solve it before him just because

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.769 
solve it before him just because
brotherly<00:00:16.650> competition<00:00:17.340> so<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:18.150> decided<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.600> go

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
brotherly competition so I decided to go

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.130 
brotherly competition so I decided to go
online<00:00:19.100> find<00:00:20.100> out<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.580> solution<00:00:20.970> from<00:00:21.930> there<00:00:22.109> I

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
online find out a solution from there I

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.200 
online find out a solution from there I
was<00:00:22.350> about<00:00:22.800> five<00:00:23.100> minutes<00:00:23.369> solving<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.119> then

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
was about five minutes solving and then

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.240 
was about five minutes solving and then
just<00:00:24.570> wanted<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.140> get<00:00:25.260> faster<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.650> faster<00:00:25.740> it

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
just wanted to get faster and faster it

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.279 
just wanted to get faster and faster it
does<00:00:26.519> just<00:00:26.789> come<00:00:27.029> down<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.570> practice<00:00:28.109> and

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
does just come down to practice and

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.460 
does just come down to practice and
practice<00:00:28.590> but<00:00:29.210> you<00:00:30.210> do<00:00:30.599> have<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.840> learn<00:00:31.050> new

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
practice but you do have to learn new

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.190 
practice but you do have to learn new
methods<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.219> faster<00:00:33.120> algorithms<00:00:33.809> which<00:00:34.079> are

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
methods and faster algorithms which are

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.620 
methods and faster algorithms which are
series<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.829> moves<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.460> solve<00:00:36.030> different<00:00:36.390> steps

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
series of moves to solve different steps

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.630 
series of moves to solve different steps
of<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.899> cube<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.680> can<00:00:37.800> find<00:00:38.010> out<00:00:38.190> almost

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
of the cube and you can find out almost

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.520 
of the cube and you can find out almost

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
get faster and I also actually started a

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.410 
get faster and I also actually started a
Cuban<00:00:49.649> community<00:00:49.770> at<00:00:50.280> my<00:00:50.460> school<00:00:50.940> last<00:00:51.239> year

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
Cuban community at my school last year

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.450 
Cuban community at my school last year
we<00:00:51.960> had<00:00:51.989> about<00:00:52.079> 10<00:00:52.559> different<00:00:52.710> members<00:00:53.190> and

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
we had about 10 different members and

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.160 
we had about 10 different members and
eventually<00:00:54.390> all<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.690> them<00:00:54.809> learned<00:00:54.930> how<00:00:55.110> to

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
eventually all of them learned how to

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.170 
eventually all of them learned how to
solve<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.530> cube<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:55.949> two<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.670> them<00:00:56.789> even<00:00:56.940> came

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
solve the cube and two of them even came

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.180 
solve the cube and two of them even came

years<00:02:04.680> ago<00:02:04.799> when<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.159> saw<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.729> Rubik's<00:02:06.119> Cube

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
years ago when I saw a Rubik's Cube

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.990 
years ago when I saw a Rubik's Cube
demonstration<00:02:06.960> on<00:02:07.079> television<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.879> was

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
demonstration on television it was

looked
add<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:14.670> I<00:02:14.760> thought<00:02:14.910> well<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.510> know<00:02:15.570> if

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
add it and I thought well you know if

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.360 
add it and I thought well you know if
you<00:02:15.780> can<00:02:15.900> do<00:02:15.990> it<00:02:16.110> by<00:02:16.320> kunai<00:02:16.680> so<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:16.980> took<00:02:17.100> it<00:02:17.280> as

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
you can do it by kunai so I took it as

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.100 
you can do it by kunai so I took it as
like<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.580> challenge<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.300> I<00:02:18.480> wanted<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.840> try<00:02:19.050> to

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
like a challenge and I wanted to try to

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.900 
like a challenge and I wanted to try to
be<00:02:19.710> a<00:02:19.740> started<00:02:20.190> saying<00:02:20.340> well<00:02:20.460> you<00:02:20.580> me<00:02:20.670> just<00:02:20.820> try

be a started saying well you me just try

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.940 
be a started saying well you me just try
to<00:02:20.970> solve<00:02:21.210> the<00:02:21.300> cube<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.810> so<00:02:22.470> after<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:22.680> got<00:02:22.830> the

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
to solve the cube and so after I got the

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.230 
to solve the cube and so after I got the
Cuban<00:02:23.250> toys<00:02:23.430> r<00:02:23.580> us<00:02:23.640> you<00:02:23.850> know<00:02:23.940> I<00:02:23.970> start
