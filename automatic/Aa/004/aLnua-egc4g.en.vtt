and we've used some really pretty

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.440 
and we've used some really pretty
twisted<00:00:20.900> wire<00:00:21.160> now<00:00:22.160> donuts<00:00:22.610> by<00:00:22.850> themselves

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:23.450 
twisted wire now donuts by themselves

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.390 
twisted wire now donuts by themselves
are<00:00:23.600> really<00:00:23.900> very<00:00:24.410> striking<00:00:25.010> and<00:00:25.160> beautiful

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.180 
figure out how you might hang them on a
chain<00:00:29.390> or<00:00:29.690> incorporate<00:00:30.500> them<00:00:30.680> into<00:00:30.890> your

this one so this is going to be 20 gauge
and<00:00:59.059> here's<00:00:59.629> silver<00:01:00.109> and<00:01:00.260> we're<00:01:00.350> actually

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
and here's silver and we're actually

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.379 
and here's silver and we're actually
going<00:01:00.649> to<00:01:00.769> be<00:01:00.829> using<00:01:01.159> gold<00:01:01.459> which<00:01:01.819> of<00:01:01.969> our<00:01:02.089> use

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:02.389 
going to be using gold which of our use

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:04.210 
going to be using gold which of our use
some<00:01:02.659> off<00:01:02.870> of<00:01:02.899> my<00:01:03.229> gold<00:01:03.440> spool<00:01:03.799> here<00:01:04.010> in<00:01:04.129> the

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
some off of my gold spool here in the

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.520 
some off of my gold spool here in the
design<00:01:04.519> space<00:01:04.820> but<00:01:05.570> do<00:01:05.689> note<00:01:05.869> it<00:01:06.020> does<00:01:06.200> come<00:01:06.409> in

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
design space but do note it does come in

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.889 
design space but do note it does come in
other<00:01:06.710> finishes<00:01:07.130> as<00:01:07.520> well<00:01:07.759> so<00:01:08.600> that's<00:01:08.750> all

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
other finishes as well so that's all

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:09.789 
other finishes as well so that's all
we're<00:01:09.020> going<00:01:09.110> to<00:01:09.170> need<00:01:09.289> for<00:01:09.469> the<00:01:09.560> actual

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
we're going to need for the actual

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.490 
we're going to need for the actual
supplies<00:01:10.280> now<00:01:10.789> for<00:01:11.030> tools<00:01:11.270> you're<00:01:12.140> going<00:01:12.350> to

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
supplies now for tools you're going to

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.130 
supplies now for tools you're going to
need<00:01:12.680> a<00:01:12.890> tube<00:01:13.310> of<00:01:13.549> seed<00:01:13.850> beads<00:01:13.880> that<00:01:14.689> sounds<00:01:15.079> a

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
need a tube of seed beads that sounds a

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.929 
need a tube of seed beads that sounds a
little<00:01:15.229> strange<00:01:15.469> perhaps<00:01:16.130> for<00:01:16.369> this<00:01:16.460> project

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
little strange perhaps for this project

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:18.520 
little strange perhaps for this project
but<00:01:17.060> we're<00:01:17.180> going<00:01:17.359> to<00:01:17.420> be<00:01:17.539> using<00:01:17.810> that<00:01:17.930> tube<00:01:18.289> as

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
but we're going to be using that tube as

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.849 
but we're going to be using that tube as
a<00:01:19.340> dowel<00:01:19.670> to<00:01:20.210> create<00:01:20.479> these<00:01:20.600> perfectly<00:01:21.380> round

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:21.859 
a dowel to create these perfectly round

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:24.609 
a dowel to create these perfectly round
loops<00:01:22.399> up<00:01:22.700> top<00:01:23.060> now<00:01:23.659> if<00:01:23.930> you<00:01:24.140> don't<00:01:24.350> have<00:01:24.500> the

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
loops up top now if you don't have the

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.800 
loops up top now if you don't have the
tube<00:01:24.799> of<00:01:24.950> seed<00:01:25.100> beads<00:01:25.130> be<00:01:25.549> do<00:01:25.789> have<00:01:25.969> a<00:01:26.000> dowel<00:01:26.299> go

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
tube of seed beads be do have a dowel go

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.420 
tube of seed beads be do have a dowel go
ahead<00:01:27.020> and<00:01:27.170> use<00:01:27.320> that<00:01:27.350> and<00:01:27.979> you<00:01:28.130> can<00:01:28.280> really

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
ahead and use that and you can really

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.010 
ahead and use that and you can really
alter<00:01:28.820> the<00:01:28.939> size<00:01:29.179> of<00:01:29.420> these<00:01:29.539> loops<00:01:29.810> to

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
alter the size of these loops to

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.020 
alter the size of these loops to
whatever<00:01:30.259> you<00:01:30.350> like<00:01:30.469> I<00:01:30.679> just<00:01:30.979> liked<00:01:31.189> the<00:01:31.789> size

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
whatever you like I just liked the size

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.510 
whatever you like I just liked the size
of<00:01:32.299> the<00:01:32.479> seed<00:01:32.659> bead<00:01:32.869> tube<00:01:33.109> a<00:01:33.320> pair<00:01:34.130> of<00:01:34.250> wire

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
of the seed bead tube a pair of wire

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.419 
of the seed bead tube a pair of wire
cutters<00:01:34.549> and<00:01:35.149> a<00:01:35.479> ruler<00:01:35.780> and<00:01:36.020> that's<00:01:36.289> it<00:01:36.530> so<00:01:37.340> to

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:37.429 
cutters and a ruler and that's it so to

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:39.760 
cutters and a ruler and that's it so to
start<00:01:37.729> we're<00:01:37.909> going<00:01:38.000> to<00:01:38.090> cut<00:01:38.270> 22<00:01:39.049> inches<00:01:39.590> of

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
start we're going to cut 22 inches of

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.550 
start we're going to cut 22 inches of
twisted<00:01:40.729> 20<00:01:41.210> gauge<00:01:41.450> wire<00:01:41.479> so<00:01:42.259> I'm<00:01:42.350> going<00:01:42.500> to

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
twisted 20 gauge wire so I'm going to

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.649 
twisted 20 gauge wire so I'm going to
put<00:01:42.679> this<00:01:42.799> on<00:01:42.979> my<00:01:43.100> ruler<00:01:43.340> it's<00:01:43.969> an<00:01:44.090> 18<00:01:44.509> inch

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
put this on my ruler it's an 18 inch

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:52.929 
put this on my ruler it's an 18 inch
ruler<00:01:45.020> I<00:01:45.700> want<00:01:46.719> 22<00:01:47.719> inches<00:01:51.130> okay<00:01:52.130> put<00:01:52.700> this

aside and this aside we're going to go
ahead<00:01:55.759> and<00:01:56.149> thread<00:01:56.869> our<00:01:57.170> wire<00:01:57.740> through<00:01:57.770> the

00:01:58.239 --> 00:01:58.249 
ahead and thread our wire through the

00:01:58.249 --> 00:02:01.539 
ahead and thread our wire through the
center<00:01:58.549> of<00:01:58.579> our<00:01:58.759> doughnut<00:01:59.090> and<00:02:00.159> bring<00:02:01.159> both

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
center of our doughnut and bring both

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.169 
center of our doughnut and bring both
ends<00:02:02.149> to<00:02:02.359> the<00:02:02.479> top<00:02:03.640> we're<00:02:04.640> going<00:02:04.759> to<00:02:04.850> take<00:02:04.999> the

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:05.179 
ends to the top we're going to take the

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:10.270 
ends to the top we're going to take the
short<00:02:05.420> end<00:02:05.719> and<00:02:06.909> twist<00:02:07.909> it<00:02:08.149> around<00:02:09.040> the<00:02:10.040> long

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
short end and twist it around the long

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.580 
short end and twist it around the long
end<00:02:10.610> we're<00:02:11.540> going<00:02:11.630> to<00:02:11.690> make<00:02:11.840> a<00:02:11.870> couple

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
end we're going to make a couple

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
end we're going to make a couple
twist<00:02:13.330> just<00:02:14.330> like<00:02:14.599> so<00:02:15.110> and<00:02:15.410> just<00:02:15.459> let<00:02:16.459> that

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
twist just like so and just let that

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.040 
twist just like so and just let that
other<00:02:16.790> end<00:02:17.030> hang<00:02:17.330> out<00:02:17.510> there<00:02:17.750> you<00:02:17.870> don't<00:02:17.959> have

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
other end hang out there you don't have

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.320 
other end hang out there you don't have
to<00:02:18.200> worry<00:02:18.349> about<00:02:18.470> it<00:02:18.620> right<00:02:18.739> now<00:02:19.120> next<00:02:20.120> we're

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
to worry about it right now next we're

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.979 
to worry about it right now next we're
going<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.480> take<00:02:20.660> our<00:02:20.840> tube<00:02:21.140> of<00:02:21.290> seed<00:02:21.500> beads<00:02:21.530> and

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
going to take our tube of seed beads and

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.050 
going to take our tube of seed beads and
we're<00:02:23.989> going<00:02:24.200> to<00:02:24.260> wrap<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:25.280> wire<00:02:25.310> around<00:02:25.520> it

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
we're going to wrap the wire around it

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.479 
we're going to wrap the wire around it
so<00:02:26.180> I'm<00:02:26.239> holding<00:02:26.510> it<00:02:26.810> right<00:02:26.840> above<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.950> twists

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
so I'm holding it right above the twists

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.220 
so I'm holding it right above the twists
that<00:02:28.640> I<00:02:28.700> just<00:02:28.970> created<00:02:29.300> with<00:02:29.630> my<00:02:29.660> other<00:02:29.930> tail

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
that I just created with my other tail

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.910 
that I just created with my other tail
of<00:02:30.410> wire<00:02:30.620> and<00:02:30.860> I'm<00:02:31.760> just<00:02:32.060> going<00:02:32.360> to<00:02:32.890> wrap<00:02:33.890> it

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
of wire and I'm just going to wrap it

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.970 
of wire and I'm just going to wrap it
around<00:02:34.160> it<00:02:34.819> and<00:02:35.000> come<00:02:35.780> back<00:02:35.989> to<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:36.560> front<00:02:36.769> of

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
around it and come back to the front of

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.280 
around it and come back to the front of
the<00:02:37.069> donut<00:02:37.630> now<00:02:38.630> I'm<00:02:38.750> going<00:02:38.930> to<00:02:38.989> thread<00:02:39.260> my

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
the donut now I'm going to thread my

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:46.059 
the donut now I'm going to thread my
tail<00:02:41.890> through<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:42.920> donut<00:02:43.400> hole<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:44.950> try<00:02:45.950> to

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
tail through the donut hole and try to

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.650 
tail through the donut hole and try to
make<00:02:46.280> sure<00:02:46.310> I<00:02:46.459> don't<00:02:46.549> get<00:02:46.760> a<00:02:46.819> kink<00:02:47.150> in<00:02:47.269> my<00:02:47.330> wire

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
make sure I don't get a kink in my wire

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.960 
make sure I don't get a kink in my wire
so<00:02:47.930> I'm<00:02:47.989> going<00:02:48.140> to<00:02:48.170> be<00:02:48.260> patient<00:02:48.739> and<00:02:48.970> just

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
so I'm going to be patient and just

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.360 
so I'm going to be patient and just
slowly<00:02:50.569> pull<00:02:51.019> my<00:02:51.200> wire<00:02:51.380> through<00:02:51.860> the<00:02:51.980> hole<00:02:52.160> so

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
slowly pull my wire through the hole so

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.240 
slowly pull my wire through the hole so
this<00:02:52.700> is<00:02:52.880> what<00:02:53.030> we<00:02:53.150> have<00:02:53.299> so<00:02:53.540> far<00:02:54.100> now<00:02:55.100> we're

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
this is what we have so far now we're

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.800 
this is what we have so far now we're
going<00:02:55.340> to<00:02:55.400> be<00:02:55.519> doing<00:02:55.640> a<00:02:55.880> figure<00:02:56.299> eight<00:02:56.480> type

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
going to be doing a figure eight type

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.860 
going to be doing a figure eight type
design<00:02:57.200> between<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.860> donut<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:58.459> the<00:02:59.000> tube<00:02:59.269> so

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
design between the donut and the tube so

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.830 
design between the donut and the tube so
I'm<00:02:59.930> going<00:03:00.049> to<00:03:00.080> come<00:03:00.260> back<00:03:00.410> to<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.680> other<00:03:00.799> side

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
I'm going to come back to the other side

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.199 
I'm going to come back to the other side
but<00:03:02.840> then<00:03:03.080> pull<00:03:03.620> it<00:03:03.769> to<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.040> front<00:03:04.610> again<00:03:04.790> and

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
but then pull it to the front again and

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.770 
but then pull it to the front again and
then<00:03:05.840> up<00:03:06.049> and<00:03:06.440> around<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:08.060> tube<00:03:08.299> of<00:03:08.569> seed

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
then up and around the tube of seed

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.860 
then up and around the tube of seed
beads<00:03:09.010> and<00:03:10.010> then<00:03:10.099> back<00:03:10.489> to<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:10.880> front<00:03:11.030> and<00:03:11.420> now

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
beads and then back to the front and now

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.890 
beads and then back to the front and now
I'm<00:03:11.959> going<00:03:12.080> to<00:03:12.170> go<00:03:12.260> through<00:03:12.590> my<00:03:12.769> donut<00:03:13.130> again

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
I'm going to go through my donut again

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.440 
I'm going to go through my donut again
and<00:03:15.040> I'm<00:03:16.040> pulling<00:03:16.310> pretty<00:03:16.850> tight<00:03:17.209> here

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
and I'm pulling pretty tight here

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.270 
and I'm pulling pretty tight here
because<00:03:17.630> I<00:03:17.750> want<00:03:17.959> those<00:03:18.109> to<00:03:18.320> be<00:03:18.350> really<00:03:19.070> nice

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
because I want those to be really nice

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.509 
because I want those to be really nice
uniform<00:03:19.970> loops<00:03:20.239> up<00:03:20.510> top<00:03:21.220> now<00:03:22.220> I'm<00:03:22.310> going<00:03:22.459> to

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
uniform loops up top now I'm going to

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.310 
uniform loops up top now I'm going to
create<00:03:22.640> three<00:03:22.940> loops<00:03:23.239> at<00:03:23.420> top<00:03:23.630> at<00:03:23.810> the<00:03:23.959> top<00:03:23.989> you

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
create three loops at top at the top you

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.050 
create three loops at top at the top you
could<00:03:24.500> create<00:03:24.920> more<00:03:25.100> if<00:03:25.250> you<00:03:25.370> want<00:03:25.579> it<00:03:25.670> as<00:03:25.820> well

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
could create more if you want it as well

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.809 
could create more if you want it as well
so<00:03:26.739> definitely<00:03:27.739> feel<00:03:27.950> free<00:03:28.130> to<00:03:28.220> use<00:03:28.549> this

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
so definitely feel free to use this

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.449 
so definitely feel free to use this
video<00:03:29.090> as<00:03:29.540> a<00:03:29.600> jumping-off<00:03:30.530> place<00:03:30.829> for<00:03:31.340> your

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
video as a jumping-off place for your

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.720 
video as a jumping-off place for your
own<00:03:31.609> designs<00:03:32.060> and<00:03:32.510> let<00:03:33.230> your<00:03:33.380> creativity<00:03:33.890> take

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
own designs and let your creativity take

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.150 
own designs and let your creativity take
over<00:03:35.090> so<00:03:35.390> again<00:03:35.900> went<00:03:36.590> through<00:03:36.739> the<00:03:36.859> donut

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
over so again went through the donut

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.099 
over so again went through the donut
pull<00:03:37.430> it<00:03:37.549> around<00:03:37.640> the<00:03:37.790> back<00:03:38.030> but<00:03:38.450> then<00:03:38.600> pull<00:03:38.930> it

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:39.109 
pull it around the back but then pull it

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:42.460 
pull it around the back but then pull it
to<00:03:39.380> the<00:03:39.410> front<00:03:39.890> and<00:03:40.389> up<00:03:41.389> and<00:03:41.690> over<00:03:41.959> that<00:03:42.260> tube

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
to the front and up and over that tube

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.319 
to the front and up and over that tube
of<00:03:42.620> seed<00:03:42.799> beads<00:03:42.829> again<00:03:43.220> in<00:03:43.609> that<00:03:43.790> figure<00:03:44.060> eight

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
of seed beads again in that figure eight

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:47.410 
of seed beads again in that figure eight
pattern<00:03:44.359> and<00:03:45.430> then<00:03:46.430> pull<00:03:46.819> it<00:03:47.060> to<00:03:47.269> the<00:03:47.299> front

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
pattern and then pull it to the front

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.740 
pattern and then pull it to the front
again<00:03:48.730> so<00:03:49.730> now<00:03:49.880> we've<00:03:50.030> got<00:03:50.150> the<00:03:50.269> three<00:03:50.480> loops

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
again so now we've got the three loops

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.920 
again so now we've got the three loops
up<00:03:50.959> top<00:03:52.090> and<00:03:53.090> we're<00:03:53.180> going<00:03:53.269> to<00:03:53.329> go<00:03:53.420> into<00:03:53.660> our

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
up top and we're going to go into our

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.580 
up top and we're going to go into our
donut<00:03:54.319> one<00:03:54.799> more<00:03:55.040> time

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.820 

just<00:04:00.220> like<00:04:00.459> so<00:04:02.459> this<00:04:03.459> is<00:04:03.580> what<00:04:03.730> we've<00:04:03.849> got<00:04:04.830> pull

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
just like so this is what we've got pull

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.670 
just like so this is what we've got pull
it<00:04:06.010> up<00:04:06.250> around<00:04:06.819> the<00:04:07.209> back<00:04:07.360> and<00:04:07.660> over<00:04:08.379> to<00:04:08.590> the

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
it up around the back and over to the

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.210 
it up around the back and over to the
front<00:04:08.950> again<00:04:09.690> and<00:04:10.690> now<00:04:11.140> we're<00:04:11.860> going<00:04:12.010> to<00:04:12.069> keep

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
front again and now we're going to keep

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.509 
front again and now we're going to keep
that<00:04:12.459> to<00:04:12.760> the<00:04:12.940> seed<00:04:13.180> beads<00:04:13.390> up<00:04:13.599> there<00:04:14.519> but

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
that to the seed beads up there but

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.640 
that to the seed beads up there but
we're<00:04:15.670> going<00:04:15.819> to<00:04:16.060> wrap<00:04:16.479> this<00:04:16.840> tail<00:04:17.199> that<00:04:17.440> just

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
we're going to wrap this tail that just

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.379 
we're going to wrap this tail that just
came<00:04:17.829> around<00:04:18.070> the<00:04:18.220> front<00:04:18.459> instead<00:04:19.090> of<00:04:19.209> going

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
came around the front instead of going

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:21.780 
came around the front instead of going
up<00:04:19.570> and<00:04:19.690> over<00:04:19.750> the<00:04:19.989> tube<00:04:20.320> again<00:04:20.699> we're<00:04:21.699> going

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
up and over the tube again we're going

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
up and over the tube again we're going
to<00:04:21.880> go<00:04:22.060> over<00:04:22.270> all<00:04:23.430> the<00:04:24.430> bottom<00:04:24.820> parts<00:04:25.389> of<00:04:25.600> these

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
to go over all the bottom parts of these

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.890 
to go over all the bottom parts of these
top<00:04:26.080> loops<00:04:26.350> so<00:04:27.190> I<00:04:27.220> just<00:04:27.520> went<00:04:27.699> around<00:04:27.810> see<00:04:28.810> I'm

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
top loops so I just went around see I'm

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.129 
top loops so I just went around see I'm
going<00:04:29.139> around<00:04:29.229> the<00:04:29.530> back<00:04:30.449> pulling<00:04:31.449> it<00:04:31.750> then<00:04:31.930> to

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
going around the back pulling it then to

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.950 
going around the back pulling it then to
the<00:04:32.169> front<00:04:32.410> again<00:04:33.450> now<00:04:34.450> I'm<00:04:34.630> going<00:04:34.750> to<00:04:34.810> go

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
the front again now I'm going to go

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.530 
the front again now I'm going to go
around<00:04:35.139> again<00:04:35.800> and<00:04:37.410> again<00:04:38.669> and<00:04:39.669> now<00:04:40.240> at<00:04:40.389> this

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
around again and again and now at this

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.440 
around again and again and now at this
point<00:04:40.900> I<00:04:41.260> want<00:04:42.190> to<00:04:42.220> trim<00:04:42.460> my<00:04:42.490> little<00:04:42.880> tail<00:04:43.150> I

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
point I want to trim my little tail I

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.420 
point I want to trim my little tail I
pretty<00:04:43.990> much<00:04:44.080> covered<00:04:44.470> the<00:04:44.770> wrappings<00:04:45.160> of<00:04:45.280> the

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
pretty much covered the wrappings of the

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.240 
pretty much covered the wrappings of the
tail<00:04:45.840> so<00:04:46.840> I<00:04:46.870> want<00:04:47.080> to<00:04:47.110> trim<00:04:47.500> off<00:04:47.680> that<00:04:47.710> short

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
tail so I want to trim off that short

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.790 
tail so I want to trim off that short
tail<00:04:48.490> and<00:04:48.900> I<00:04:49.900> want<00:04:50.110> to<00:04:50.169> go<00:04:50.260> around<00:04:50.940> again<00:04:52.800> like

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
tail and I want to go around again like

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.430 
tail and I want to go around again like
so<00:04:54.070> and<00:04:54.810> then<00:04:55.810> pull<00:04:56.350> it<00:04:56.530> and<00:04:58.139> now<00:04:59.139> at<00:04:59.289> this

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
so and then pull it and now at this

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.100 
so and then pull it and now at this
point<00:04:59.740> I'm<00:05:00.039> going<00:05:00.190> to<00:05:00.280> steadily<00:05:00.760> take<00:05:01.570> out<00:05:01.780> my

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
point I'm going to steadily take out my

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:12.270 
point I'm going to steadily take out my
tube<00:05:08.850> there<00:05:09.850> we<00:05:10.060> go<00:05:10.590> and<00:05:11.590> now<00:05:11.650> I<00:05:11.830> want<00:05:12.220> to

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
tube there we go and now I want to

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.750 
tube there we go and now I want to
secure<00:05:12.850> this<00:05:13.030> wire<00:05:13.300> so<00:05:13.660> I<00:05:14.470> find<00:05:15.460> it<00:05:15.610> a<00:05:15.669> little

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
secure this wire so I find it a little

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.900 
secure this wire so I find it a little
easier<00:05:16.030> if<00:05:16.450> you<00:05:16.570> cut<00:05:16.960> it<00:05:17.080> on<00:05:17.260> the<00:05:18.039> actual<00:05:18.220> edge

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
easier if you cut it on the actual edge

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.200 
easier if you cut it on the actual edge
of<00:05:19.389> the<00:05:20.020> gemstone<00:05:20.860> donut<00:05:21.280> just<00:05:21.910> if<00:05:22.030> for<00:05:22.180> some

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
of the gemstone donut just if for some

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.820 
of the gemstone donut just if for some
reason<00:05:22.570> holds<00:05:22.900> the<00:05:23.020> wire<00:05:23.139> a<00:05:23.200> little<00:05:23.530> bit<00:05:23.650> more

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
reason holds the wire a little bit more

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.020 
reason holds the wire a little bit more
so<00:05:24.070> you're<00:05:24.310> just<00:05:24.520> going<00:05:24.669> to<00:05:24.760> cut<00:05:24.910> it<00:05:24.940> right

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
so you're just going to cut it right

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.760 
so you're just going to cut it right
there<00:05:27.180> now<00:05:28.180> we've<00:05:28.300> created<00:05:28.450> our<00:05:28.750> wrapping<00:05:29.080> so

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
there now we've created our wrapping so

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.650 
there now we've created our wrapping so
now<00:05:29.889> what<00:05:30.070> we<00:05:30.160> can<00:05:30.310> do<00:05:30.430> is<00:05:30.639> we<00:05:30.849> can<00:05:30.970> leave<00:05:31.360> those

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
now what we can do is we can leave those

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.260 
now what we can do is we can leave those
as<00:05:31.930> they<00:05:32.289> are<00:05:32.470> or<00:05:32.770> we<00:05:33.370> can<00:05:33.520> just<00:05:33.729> fan<00:05:34.000> them<00:05:34.240> out

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
as they are or we can just fan them out

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.469 
as they are or we can just fan them out
a<00:05:34.720> little<00:05:35.260> bit<00:05:35.530> just<00:05:35.740> for<00:05:36.700> one<00:05:37.000> more<00:05:37.300> little

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
a little bit just for one more little

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:41.129 
a little bit just for one more little
decorative<00:05:38.050> element<00:05:38.500> and<00:05:38.770> that<00:05:39.840> is<00:05:40.840> how<00:05:41.080> you
