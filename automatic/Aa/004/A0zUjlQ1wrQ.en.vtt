00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 good day with you channel master secret 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:07.529
 Let's collect this Christmas tree today 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:14.759
 square sheet of paper bent 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:20.630
 diagonals we add we fold 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.630
 way necessarily well ironed 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.820
 invest other parties 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.660
 turn over but arch out 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:40.479
 warehouses like this take halves and 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:49.839
 We add up to the middle, so proceed with 

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:56.909
 after bending we fill with all edges 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:56.909
 inward in this way 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:11.170
 after all the bending we get here 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:11.170
 such a billet we take scissors we cut off 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:24.549
 make such a cut 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.549
 cut off the bottom edge 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:43.890
 and now itâ€™s important to make cuts 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.890
 just a cut 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.060
 two notch 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:58.469
 three notch similarly on the other hand 1 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:59.070
 notch 2 notch and notch and start 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.920
 to form 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.400
 sprig of Christmas tree 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:13.610
 take the edge and bend it, but here it was 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:17.480
 any so consistently we fold all 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.959
 faces after bending all the faces we have 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.569
 this is a Christmas tree 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:26.860
 but it 's not all you can make a star 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:29.300
 on the Christmas tree years is taken here are two faces 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:34.640
 the other faces are turned in the direction 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:37.840
 and an incision is made here such an oblique incision 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:43.060
 a little bit beyond the middle line 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.060
 be careful to cut off the top of your head like this 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.610
 and twist the cut out take for 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.660
