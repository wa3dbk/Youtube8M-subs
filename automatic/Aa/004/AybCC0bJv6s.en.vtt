00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.240 
I look like so when you weigh in you
must<00:03:00.790> give<00:03:00.970> them<00:03:01.150> your<00:03:01.569> initial<00:03:02.260> lifts<00:03:02.740> so<00:03:03.160> you

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
must give them your initial lifts so you

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.830 
must give them your initial lifts so you
must<00:03:03.340> know<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:03.760> lifts<00:03:04.120> actually<00:03:04.720> in

must know the lifts actually in
kilograms<00:03:05.319> which<00:03:05.470> they<00:03:05.860> have<00:03:05.950> a<00:03:06.010> conversion

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
kilograms which they have a conversion

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.040 
kilograms which they have a conversion
sheet<00:03:06.490> there<00:03:06.819> but<00:03:07.060> you<00:03:07.480> got<00:03:07.630> to<00:03:07.660> know<00:03:07.840> what

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
sheet there but you got to know what

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.660 
sheet there but you got to know what
your<00:03:08.170> opening<00:03:08.680> number<00:03:08.920> is<00:03:09.100> going<00:03:09.250> to<00:03:09.310> be<00:03:09.400> and

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
your opening number is going to be and

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.520 
your opening number is going to be and
that<00:03:09.940> number<00:03:10.150> you<00:03:10.360> cannot<00:03:10.630> change<00:03:10.900> so<00:03:11.320> once

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
that number you cannot change so once

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.920 
that number you cannot change so once
you<00:03:11.680> tell<00:03:12.040> them<00:03:12.250> you're<00:03:13.060> opening<00:03:13.360> number<00:03:13.540> so

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
you tell them you're opening number so

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.110 
you tell them you're opening number so
for<00:03:14.110> squat<00:03:14.380> let's<00:03:14.590> let's<00:03:14.860> just<00:03:15.130> say<00:03:15.850> i'm<00:03:16.000> going

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
for squat let's let's just say i'm going

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.960 
for squat let's let's just say i'm going
to<00:03:16.180> do<00:03:16.270> 325<00:03:16.690> k<00:03:17.100> that<00:03:18.100> is<00:03:18.130> a<00:03:18.340> number<00:03:18.700> that<00:03:18.730> they

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
to do 325 k that is a number that they

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.760 
to do 325 k that is a number that they
are<00:03:19.060> going<00:03:19.090> to<00:03:19.209> put<00:03:19.480> on<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:19.810> damn<00:03:19.989> bar<00:03:20.260> when

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
are going to put on the damn bar when

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.470 
are going to put on the damn bar when
you<00:03:20.890> go<00:03:21.040> up<00:03:21.220> to<00:03:21.250> do<00:03:21.550> your<00:03:21.670> squat<00:03:22.030> because<00:03:22.300> they

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
you go up to do your squat because they

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.820 
you go up to do your squat because they
have<00:03:22.570> it<00:03:22.660> all<00:03:22.720> set<00:03:22.959> up<00:03:22.989> you<00:03:23.230> can't<00:03:23.440> change<00:03:23.650> that

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
have it all set up you can't change that

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.030 
have it all set up you can't change that
then<00:03:24.730> once<00:03:25.360> you<00:03:25.510> perform<00:03:25.930> your<00:03:26.080> first<00:03:26.530> lift

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
then once you perform your first lift

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.460 
then once you perform your first lift
you<00:03:27.580> have<00:03:27.820> approximately<00:03:28.510> 30<00:03:28.900> seconds

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
you have approximately 30 seconds

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.100 
you have approximately 30 seconds
usually<00:03:29.860> to<00:03:30.370> go<00:03:30.580> tell<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:31.120> judges<00:03:31.390> what<00:03:31.600> your
