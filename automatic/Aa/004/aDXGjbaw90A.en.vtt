Praetorian fuse allure I still don't

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.570 
Praetorian fuse allure I still don't
know<00:00:07.080> how<00:00:07.230> to<00:00:07.259> say<00:00:07.470> that<00:00:07.620> correctly<00:00:07.980> but<00:00:08.099> I

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
know how to say that correctly but I

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.549 
know how to say that correctly but I

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.430 
wanted to show all its visitors
basically<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.599> this<00:00:12.599> hit<00:00:12.870> point<00:00:13.110> is<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.290> little

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
basically and this hit point is a little

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.129 
basically and this hit point is a little
bit<00:00:13.559> skewed<00:00:13.830> because<00:00:14.219> I<00:00:14.250> do<00:00:14.370> have<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:15.139> armored

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
bit skewed because I do have a armored

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.450 
bit skewed because I do have a armored
blessing<00:00:16.590> but<00:00:16.800> they<00:00:16.920> do<00:00:16.980> have<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.250> lot<00:00:17.430> of

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
blessing but they do have a lot of

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.830 
blessing but they do have a lot of
health<00:00:17.640> in<00:00:17.760> general

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
health in general

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.490 
health in general
they<00:00:19.170> usually<00:00:19.410> have<00:00:19.560> about<00:00:20.070> 600<00:00:21.060> ish<00:00:21.300> um<00:00:22.080> so

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
they usually have about 600 ish um so

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.970 
they usually have about 600 ish um so
that<00:00:22.740> I<00:00:22.980> know<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.550> any<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:24.269> know<00:00:24.619> any<00:00:25.619> hit

this troop is basically just trying to
overwhelm<00:01:13.500> your<00:01:13.619> opponent<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.240> guy

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
see if we can take him out so he's a

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
see if we can take him out so he's a
level<00:01:17.880> 72<00:01:18.420> he's<00:01:19.080> Enlightenment<00:01:19.590> age<00:01:19.680> also<00:01:20.720> he

level 72 he's Enlightenment age also he

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.330 
level 72 he's Enlightenment age also he
does<00:01:21.900> have<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.080> general<00:01:22.470> as<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.799> can<00:01:23.070> see<00:01:23.189> right

does have a general as you can see right

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.499 
does have a general as you can see right
there<00:01:24.590> so<00:01:25.759> the<00:01:26.759> things<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.060> need<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.240> worry

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
there so the things I need to worry

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.380 
there so the things I need to worry
about<00:01:27.630> are<00:01:27.960> just<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.860> garrisons<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.909> the

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
about are just the garrisons and the

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.460 
about are just the garrisons and the
catapults<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.250> I'm<00:01:32.250> gonna<00:01:32.720> use<00:01:33.720> two<00:01:34.049> fingers

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
catapults so I'm gonna use two fingers

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.440 
catapults so I'm gonna use two fingers
since<00:01:34.799> I'm<00:01:34.920> using<00:01:35.070> my<00:01:35.220> phone<00:01:35.400> actually<00:01:35.610> just

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
since I'm using my phone actually just

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.110 
since I'm using my phone actually just
multi-touch<00:01:36.960> and

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.120 
multi-touch and

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:47.840 
multi-touch and
Sequoyah<00:01:40.120> most<00:01:40.450> of<00:01:40.570> my<00:01:40.630> truths

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.270 

and<00:01:48.080> problem<00:01:49.080> with<00:01:49.260> these<00:01:49.440> troops<00:01:49.830> I<00:01:49.979> have

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
and problem with these troops I have

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.770 
and problem with these troops I have
they<00:01:50.550> need<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.120> really<00:01:51.330> stick<00:01:51.600> together

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
they need to really stick together

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.860 
they need to really stick together
because<00:01:52.409> if<00:01:52.860> they<00:01:53.460> don't<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:54.240> know<00:01:54.270> they're

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
because if they don't you know they're

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.860 
because if they don't you know they're
gonna<00:01:55.320> gonna<00:01:55.770> get<00:01:56.250> crushed<00:01:56.729> they<00:01:57.450> really<00:01:57.720> need

gonna gonna get crushed they really need
to<00:01:57.930> stick<00:01:58.110> together<00:01:58.260> so<00:02:00.020> I<00:02:01.610> only<00:02:02.610> must<00:02:02.909> exceed

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
to stick together so I only must exceed

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.910 
to stick together so I only must exceed
20<00:02:03.600> trips<00:02:03.840> apart<00:02:04.229> it's<00:02:04.350> actually<00:02:04.619> not<00:02:04.710> bad<00:02:04.770> I

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
20 trips apart it's actually not bad I

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.790 
20 trips apart it's actually not bad I
thought<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.430> would<00:02:05.550> be<00:02:05.670> losing<00:02:05.970> a<00:02:06.030> lot<00:02:06.060> more<00:02:06.420> I

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
thought it would be losing a lot more I

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.380 
thought it would be losing a lot more I
guess<00:02:07.800> basically<00:02:08.130> I'm<00:02:08.520> just<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:09.179> just

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
guess basically I'm just you just

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.980 
guess basically I'm just you just
overwhelming<00:02:09.990> our<00:02:10.200> opponent<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.920> so<00:02:11.810> see<00:02:12.810> how

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
overwhelming our opponent and so see how

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.880 
overwhelming our opponent and so see how
much<00:02:13.110> I<00:02:13.260> can<00:02:13.440> do

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
much I can do

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.830 
much I can do
yeah<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:14.970> general<00:02:15.330> can't<00:02:15.570> stand<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:15.810> chance

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
yeah the general can't stand a chance

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.860 
yeah the general can't stand a chance
against<00:02:16.320> all<00:02:16.560> of<00:02:16.800> these<00:02:16.950> letters<00:02:17.250> so<00:02:17.870> the

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
against all of these letters so the

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.479 
against all of these letters so the
catapults<00:02:19.380> doing<00:02:19.830> just<00:02:20.010> fine

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
catapults doing just fine

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.630 
catapults doing just fine
taking<00:02:20.940> those<00:02:21.030> out<00:02:21.920> yeah<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.310> only<00:02:23.430> thing<00:02:23.580> I

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
taking those out yeah the only thing I

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.710 
taking those out yeah the only thing I
was<00:02:23.730> really<00:02:24.030> worried<00:02:24.180> about<00:02:24.330> is<00:02:24.480> just<00:02:24.540> two

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
was really worried about is just two

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.720 
was really worried about is just two
Garrison's<00:02:25.200> because<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:26.010> know<00:02:26.130> they<00:02:26.280> do<00:02:26.459> like

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
Garrison's because you know they do like

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.240 
Garrison's because you know they do like
two<00:02:27.060> times<00:02:27.239> damage<00:02:27.690> to<00:02:27.870> my<00:02:27.989> troop<00:02:28.290> so<00:02:28.620> that's

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
two times damage to my troop so that's

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.030 
two times damage to my troop so that's
the<00:02:29.400> only<00:02:29.520> thing<00:02:29.730> I<00:02:29.790> really<00:02:30.000> worry<00:02:30.209> about<00:02:30.300> and

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
the only thing I really worry about and

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.260 
the only thing I really worry about and
besides<00:02:32.040> that<00:02:32.190> you<00:02:32.459> know<00:02:32.580> basically<00:02:32.850> it's

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
besides that you know basically it's

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.240 
besides that you know basically it's
just<00:02:33.330> you<00:02:33.600> steamroll<00:02:34.050> alone<00:02:34.230> so<00:02:36.890> this<00:02:37.890> at<00:02:38.070> one

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
just you steamroll alone so this at one

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.699 
just you steamroll alone so this at one
garrison<00:02:38.640> at<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.850> end<00:02:39.000> but<00:02:39.470> this<00:02:40.470> should<00:02:40.650> be

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
garrison at the end but this should be

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.560 
garrison at the end but this should be
fine<00:02:41.810> yep<00:02:43.010> so<00:02:44.010> basically<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:44.850> lost<00:02:45.180> about<00:02:45.330> odd

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
fine yep so basically I lost about odd

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.759 
fine yep so basically I lost about odd
Oh<00:02:45.870> No<00:02:47.660> do<00:02:48.660> you<00:02:48.720> guys<00:02:48.870> ever<00:02:48.989> do<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.380> when<00:02:49.650> you

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
Oh No do you guys ever do that when you

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.470 
Oh No do you guys ever do that when you
accidentally<00:02:50.400> have<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:50.700> rally<00:02:50.880> on<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.360> then

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
accidentally have the rally on and then

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.020 
accidentally have the rally on and then
you<00:02:51.570> touch<00:02:51.810> your<00:02:51.989> screen<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.680> you<00:02:53.030> you

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
you touch your screen and you you

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.320 
you touch your screen and you you
automatically<00:02:55.310> basically<00:02:56.310> you<00:02:57.000> put<00:02:57.209> your

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
automatically basically you put your

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.550 
automatically basically you put your
troops<00:02:57.570> so<00:02:57.780> you<00:02:58.170> rally<00:02:58.380> your<00:02:58.500> troops

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
troops so you rally your troops

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.410 
troops so you rally your troops
somewhere<00:02:59.070> else<00:02:59.160> by<00:02:59.370> accident<00:02:59.850> I<00:03:00.000> know<00:03:00.239> that

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
somewhere else by accident I know that

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.660 
somewhere else by accident I know that
happens<00:03:00.570> to<00:03:00.840> me<00:03:00.959> often<00:03:01.620> so<00:03:02.070> I<00:03:02.130> try<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.370> keep<00:03:02.549> my

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
happens to me often so I try to keep my

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.199 
happens to me often so I try to keep my
troop<00:03:03.000> my<00:03:03.690> cursor<00:03:04.320> like<00:03:04.530> basically<00:03:05.130> on<00:03:05.340> like

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
troop my cursor like basically on like

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.000 
troop my cursor like basically on like
my<00:03:06.420> troops<00:03:06.750> so<00:03:07.079> that<00:03:07.260> I<00:03:07.290> don't<00:03:07.410> accidentally

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
my troops so that I don't accidentally

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.479 
my troops so that I don't accidentally
do<00:03:08.220> that<00:03:08.400> I<00:03:08.670> lost<00:03:09.510> about<00:03:09.630> 50<00:03:10.079> troops<00:03:10.340> you<00:03:11.340> can

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
do that I lost about 50 troops you can

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.140 
do that I lost about 50 troops you can
split<00:03:11.760> that<00:03:11.790> maybe<00:03:12.480> that's<00:03:12.660> like<00:03:13.640> 17<00:03:14.640> each<00:03:14.790> ish

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
split that maybe that's like 17 each ish

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.720 
split that maybe that's like 17 each ish
so<00:03:15.690> I<00:03:15.959> don't<00:03:16.920> think<00:03:17.100> it's<00:03:17.190> that<00:03:17.280> bad<00:03:17.430> for<00:03:17.670> an

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
so I don't think it's that bad for an

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.340 
so I don't think it's that bad for an
alignment<00:03:17.970> age<00:03:18.239> base<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.690> be<00:03:18.780> honest<00:03:19.079> because

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
alignment age base to be honest because

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.500 
alignment age base to be honest because
I<00:03:19.769> thought<00:03:20.430> it<00:03:20.579> would<00:03:20.670> be<00:03:20.760> way<00:03:20.940> worse<00:03:21.120> that

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
I thought it would be way worse that

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.300 
I thought it would be way worse that
that<00:03:21.690> would<00:03:21.810> just<00:03:21.959> get<00:03:22.110> like<00:03:22.380> you<00:03:23.160> know

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
that would just get like you know

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.400 
that would just get like you know
everything<00:03:23.910> would<00:03:24.060> especially<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:25.049> readouts

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
everything would especially the readouts

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.210 
everything would especially the readouts
you<00:03:25.650> know<00:03:25.769> we<00:03:26.130> do<00:03:26.280> a<00:03:26.310> lot<00:03:26.459> of<00:03:26.489> damage<00:03:26.910> so<00:03:28.220> for

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
you know we do a lot of damage so for

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.490 
you know we do a lot of damage so for
the<00:03:29.280> most<00:03:29.430> part<00:03:29.670> that<00:03:30.239> went<00:03:30.510> actually<00:03:31.320> a<00:03:31.350> lot

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
the most part that went actually a lot

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.259 
the most part that went actually a lot
better<00:03:31.620> than<00:03:31.860> I<00:03:31.950> expected<00:03:32.160> it<00:03:32.820> to<00:03:32.910> be

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
better than I expected it to be

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.160 
better than I expected it to be
I<00:03:33.299> lost<00:03:33.930> 51<00:03:34.440> so<00:03:34.709> that's<00:03:34.920> 70<00:03:35.910> times<00:03:36.180> 3<00:03:36.390> is<00:03:36.540> 51<00:03:36.810> so

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
I lost 51 so that's 70 times 3 is 51 so

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.539 
I lost 51 so that's 70 times 3 is 51 so
17<00:03:37.650> each<00:03:37.769> that's<00:03:38.220> not<00:03:38.430> bad<00:03:38.610> at<00:03:38.850> all<00:03:38.970> I<00:03:39.269> think<00:03:40.549> I

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
17 each that's not bad at all I think I

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.880 
17 each that's not bad at all I think I
think<00:03:42.090> that<00:03:42.120> all<00:03:42.720> fees<00:03:43.049> are<00:03:43.200> roll<00:03:43.320> it<00:03:43.470> off

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
think that all fees are roll it off

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.520 
think that all fees are roll it off
easily<00:03:44.489> raid<00:03:44.880> is<00:03:45.150> actually<00:03:45.570> quite<00:03:45.900> you<00:03:46.380> know

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
easily raid is actually quite you know

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.699 
easily raid is actually quite you know
it<00:03:46.980> works<00:03:47.250> pretty<00:03:47.430> well<00:03:47.549> it's<00:03:48.180> quite<00:03:48.780> capable

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
it works pretty well it's quite capable

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.920 
it works pretty well it's quite capable
of<00:03:49.769> taking<00:03:50.070> out<00:03:50.579> bases<00:03:51.120> I<00:03:51.360> don't<00:03:51.630> know<00:03:51.720> about

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
of taking out bases I don't know about

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.030 
of taking out bases I don't know about
the<00:03:52.260> highest<00:03:52.680> level<00:03:52.980> bases<00:03:53.870> but<00:03:54.870> overall<00:03:55.650> it

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
the highest level bases but overall it

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.190 
the highest level bases but overall it
it<00:03:56.699> does<00:03:56.940> the<00:03:57.060> job

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
it does the job

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.230 
it does the job
I<00:03:58.230> mean<00:03:59.040> you<00:03:59.280> lose<00:03:59.430> a<00:03:59.490> little<00:03:59.640> bit<00:03:59.730> more<00:03:59.819> troops

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240 
I mean you lose a little bit more troops

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.089 
I mean you lose a little bit more troops
than<00:04:00.420> you<00:04:00.510> would<00:04:00.660> like<00:04:00.709> compared<00:04:01.709> to<00:04:01.860> like<00:04:01.980> the

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
than you would like compared to like the

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.320 
than you would like compared to like the
all<00:04:02.220> Lancer<00:04:02.640> raid<00:04:02.880> you<00:04:03.390> know<00:04:03.620> what<00:04:04.620> can<00:04:04.800> you<00:04:04.830> do

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
all Lancer raid you know what can you do

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.460 
all Lancer raid you know what can you do
let's<00:04:06.330> see<00:04:06.450> how<00:04:06.540> many<00:04:06.599> crowns<00:04:06.870> I<00:04:07.020> have<00:04:07.170> I<00:04:07.200> have

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
let's see how many crowns I have I have

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:13.370 
let's see how many crowns I have I have
819<00:04:08.459> I<00:04:08.790> think<00:04:09.630> I'll<00:04:09.780> just<00:04:09.989> do<00:04:12.050> see<00:04:13.050> you

819 I think I'll just do see you

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.979 
819 I think I'll just do see you
I<00:04:13.970> don't<00:04:14.970> usually<00:04:15.090> ever<00:04:15.390> use<00:04:15.600> crowns<00:04:15.870> for

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
I don't usually ever use crowns for

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.379 
I don't usually ever use crowns for
anything<00:04:16.470> actually<00:04:16.709> but<00:04:17.160> just<00:04:18.120> for<00:04:18.269> you<00:04:18.359> guys

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
anything actually but just for you guys

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.650 
anything actually but just for you guys
I<00:04:18.750> just<00:04:18.780> wanted<00:04:19.109> to<00:04:19.290> you<00:04:19.950> know<00:04:20.419> speed<00:04:21.419> up<00:04:21.510> some

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
I just wanted to you know speed up some

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:22.879 
I just wanted to you know speed up some
of<00:04:21.720> this<00:04:21.810> process<00:04:22.260> so<00:04:22.320> I<00:04:22.350> can<00:04:22.500> show<00:04:22.650> another

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
of this process so I can show another

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.030 
of this process so I can show another
raid<00:04:23.780> and<00:04:24.780> you<00:04:24.870> kind<00:04:25.080> of<00:04:25.139> split<00:04:25.350> up<00:04:25.380> these<00:04:25.620> a

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
raid and you kind of split up these a

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:38.300 
raid and you kind of split up these a
little<00:04:26.280> bit<00:04:26.400> more<00:04:31.490> okay<00:04:35.840> and<00:04:36.840> so<00:04:37.500> let's<00:04:38.190> see

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
little bit more okay and so let's see

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.070 
little bit more okay and so let's see
how<00:04:38.370> many<00:04:38.430> trips<00:04:38.669> I<00:04:38.790> have<00:04:38.970> all<00:04:39.660> together<00:04:39.870> I

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
how many trips I have all together I

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.760 
how many trips I have all together I
have<00:04:40.260> about<00:04:40.470> 116<00:04:41.070> that<00:04:41.639> should<00:04:41.790> be<00:04:41.850> enough

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
have about 116 that should be enough

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.629 
have about 116 that should be enough
okay<00:04:43.770> so<00:04:43.830> you<00:04:44.010> can<00:04:44.160> actually<00:04:44.280> see<00:04:44.520> that

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
okay so you can actually see that

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:45.860 
okay so you can actually see that
regional<00:04:44.940> hit<00:04:45.090> points<00:04:45.360> now<00:04:45.450> since<00:04:45.690> I<00:04:45.780> don't

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
regional hit points now since I don't

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.430 
regional hit points now since I don't
have<00:04:45.960> an<00:04:46.110> armor<00:04:46.410> blessing<00:04:46.860> and<00:04:47.100> so<00:04:48.090> that's<00:04:48.440> 522

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
have an armor blessing and so that's 522

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.750 
have an armor blessing and so that's 522
it's<00:04:49.680> actually<00:04:49.979> less<00:04:50.130> than<00:04:50.160> I<00:04:50.370> thought<00:04:50.550> but

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
it's actually less than I thought but

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.030 
it's actually less than I thought but
still<00:04:50.930> the<00:04:51.930> armor<00:04:52.169> ability<00:04:52.530> does<00:04:52.710> help<00:04:52.889> out<00:04:53.010> a

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
still the armor ability does help out a

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.110 
still the armor ability does help out a
lot<00:04:54.229> let<00:04:55.229> me<00:04:55.320> put<00:04:55.800> a<00:04:55.830> weapon<00:04:56.190> blessing<00:04:56.610> see<00:04:56.940> how

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
lot let me put a weapon blessing see how

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.570 
lot let me put a weapon blessing see how
that<00:04:57.330> how<00:04:57.810> much<00:04:57.900> damage<00:04:58.229> that<00:04:58.290> does<00:04:58.620> so<00:04:58.979> I<00:04:59.220> had

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
that how much damage that does so I had

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.950 
that how much damage that does so I had
to<00:04:59.760> 220<00:05:00.690> originally<00:05:01.200> and<00:05:01.440> so<00:05:02.250> I<00:05:02.310> got<00:05:02.460> 264<00:05:03.270> and

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
to 220 originally and so I got 264 and

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.760 
to 220 originally and so I got 264 and
so<00:05:04.169> it's<00:05:04.590> quite<00:05:04.919> strong<00:05:06.350> not<00:05:07.350> strong<00:05:07.590> as<00:05:07.680> a

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
so it's quite strong not strong as a

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.510 
so it's quite strong not strong as a
Japanese<00:05:08.160> of<00:05:08.370> course<00:05:08.400> but<00:05:09.330> you<00:05:10.110> know<00:05:10.520> this

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
Japanese of course but you know this

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.130 
Japanese of course but you know this
troop<00:05:11.880> this<00:05:12.300> troop<00:05:12.510> combination<00:05:12.930> I<00:05:12.960> love

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
troop this troop combination I love

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.480 
troop this troop combination I love
fuselage<00:05:13.560> because<00:05:13.860> you<00:05:13.950> know<00:05:14.039> they<00:05:14.190> can<00:05:14.340> shoot

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
fuselage because you know they can shoot

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.219 
fuselage because you know they can shoot
over<00:05:14.700> the<00:05:14.820> wall<00:05:15.000> and<00:05:15.360> just<00:05:15.510> that<00:05:15.870> makes<00:05:16.020> things

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
over the wall and just that makes things

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:24.440 
over the wall and just that makes things
a<00:05:16.320> lot<00:05:16.410> more<00:05:16.620> exciting<00:05:20.390> this<00:05:21.390> raid<00:05:21.720> I<00:05:22.880> I<00:05:23.880> mean<00:05:24.270> I

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
a lot more exciting this raid I I mean I

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.010 
a lot more exciting this raid I I mean I
can<00:05:24.660> beat<00:05:24.840> them<00:05:26.720> problem<00:05:27.720> is<00:05:27.810> just<00:05:27.900> the

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
can beat them problem is just the

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.540 
can beat them problem is just the
catapults<00:05:28.620> I<00:05:28.710> think<00:05:28.979> I<00:05:29.039> should<00:05:29.220> be<00:05:29.310> able<00:05:29.370> take

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
catapults I think I should be able take

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.460 
catapults I think I should be able take
them<00:05:29.669> out<00:05:29.789> though<00:05:29.970> so<00:05:30.690> I'm<00:05:30.900> gonna<00:05:31.020> spread<00:05:31.320> up

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
them out though so I'm gonna spread up

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.770 
them out though so I'm gonna spread up
my<00:05:31.590> troops<00:05:31.890> in<00:05:32.130> like<00:05:32.460> three<00:05:33.000> different<00:05:33.539> spots

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
my troops in like three different spots

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.710 
my troops in like three different spots
so<00:05:34.110> the<00:05:34.410> catapult<00:05:34.830> doesn't<00:05:35.130> attack

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
so the catapult doesn't attack

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:41.830 
so the catapult doesn't attack
ef4<00:05:36.410> spot<00:05:36.800> over<00:05:37.010> here<00:05:40.420> since<00:05:41.420> they<00:05:41.510> can't<00:05:41.690> talk

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
ef4 spot over here since they can't talk

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.240 
ef4 spot over here since they can't talk
over<00:05:42.050> the<00:05:42.140> walls<00:05:42.350> they<00:05:42.770> basically<00:05:43.100> just

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
over the walls they basically just

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.640 
over the walls they basically just
destroy<00:05:43.820> these<00:05:44.000> front<00:05:44.330> trips<00:05:44.600> right<00:05:44.750> here<00:05:44.990> and

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
destroy these front trips right here and

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.020 
destroy these front trips right here and
so<00:05:45.950> that's<00:05:46.580> awesome

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
so that's awesome

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:52.750 
so that's awesome
I<00:05:48.910> need<00:05:49.910> to<00:05:50.030> pull<00:05:50.270> them<00:05:50.390> back<00:05:50.600> together<00:05:51.760> like

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
I need to pull them back together like

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.000 
I need to pull them back together like
everyone<00:05:53.720> get<00:05:53.870> over<00:05:54.050> here<00:05:54.320> so<00:05:54.500> they<00:05:54.710> can<00:05:54.860> take

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.010 
everyone get over here so they can take

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:58.710 
everyone get over here so they can take
up<00:05:55.130> and<00:05:55.280> catapult

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.630 

come<00:05:59.720> on<00:05:59.810> guys<00:05:59.990> get<00:06:00.170> away<00:06:00.260> from<00:06:00.380> Dalton<00:06:01.250> stack

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:01.640 
come on guys get away from Dalton stack

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.970 
come on guys get away from Dalton stack
up<00:06:01.820> like<00:06:01.970> that<00:06:02.120> take<00:06:02.300> out<00:06:02.390> the<00:06:02.450> catapult<00:06:02.980> good

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:03.980 
up like that take out the catapult good

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.760 
up like that take out the catapult good
and<00:06:04.790> so<00:06:05.120> basically<00:06:05.720> the<00:06:06.170> catapults<00:06:06.620> are<00:06:06.680> the

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
and so basically the catapults are the

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.440 
and so basically the catapults are the
big<00:06:06.950> problems<00:06:07.340> to<00:06:07.400> the<00:06:07.520> fusers<00:06:07.850> to<00:06:08.060> be<00:06:08.150> honest

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:08.450 
big problems to the fusers to be honest

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:09.220 
big problems to the fusers to be honest
the<00:06:08.690> readouts

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:09.230 
the readouts

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.020 
the readouts
usually<00:06:10.190> they<00:06:10.280> can<00:06:10.400> take<00:06:10.550> them<00:06:10.700> out<00:06:10.760> fast

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.030 
usually they can take them out fast

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.030 
usually they can take them out fast
enough<00:06:11.330> so<00:06:12.200> that's<00:06:12.290> not<00:06:12.470> usually<00:06:12.800> a<00:06:12.830> big

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:13.040 
enough so that's not usually a big

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.780 
enough so that's not usually a big
problem

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:13.790 
problem

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:21.040 
problem
I<00:06:14.530> think<00:06:15.610> that's<00:06:18.730> Ania<00:06:19.730> rally<00:06:20.060> so<00:06:20.570> I<00:06:20.780> needed<00:06:20.990> to

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050 
I think that's Ania rally so I needed to

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.380 
I think that's Ania rally so I needed to
rally<00:06:21.260> them<00:06:21.440> back<00:06:21.590> together

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:22.390 
rally them back together

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.080 
rally them back together
probably<00:06:23.390> good<00:06:23.570> smothers<00:06:23.900> over<00:06:24.140> cure<00:06:24.970> so<00:06:25.970> they

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 
probably good smothers over cure so they

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.810 
probably good smothers over cure so they
can<00:06:26.240> rally<00:06:26.390> back<00:06:26.660> up<00:06:26.900> to<00:06:27.230> take<00:06:27.470> up<00:06:27.650> take<00:06:28.610> down

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:28.820 
can rally back up to take up take down

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:35.290 
can rally back up to take up take down
the<00:06:28.940> wall<00:06:30.430> and<00:06:31.430> then<00:06:32.770> yep<00:06:33.910> for<00:06:34.910> the<00:06:34.940> most<00:06:35.120> part

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
the wall and then yep for the most part

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.960 
the wall and then yep for the most part
this<00:06:35.360> is<00:06:35.510> going<00:06:35.720> well<00:06:36.190> man<00:06:37.190> I<00:06:37.340> lost<00:06:37.730> a<00:06:37.850> little

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:37.970 
this is going well man I lost a little

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:42.040 
this is going well man I lost a little
bit<00:06:38.120> more<00:06:38.240> troops<00:06:38.540> than<00:06:38.630> I<00:06:38.750> would<00:06:38.870> like<00:06:41.050> that's

think that was a good rate overall I
mean<00:07:46.210> I<00:07:46.270> ain't<00:07:46.360> get<00:07:46.510> that<00:07:46.630> much<00:07:46.750> loot<00:07:47.050> you<00:07:47.290> know

but I did enjoy using a lot of Fusiliers
it's<00:07:50.500> uh<00:07:50.770> I<00:07:51.340> think<00:07:51.490> it's<00:07:51.760> a<00:07:51.790> legitimate

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:52.450 
it's uh I think it's a legitimate

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:54.090 
it's uh I think it's a legitimate
strategy<00:07:52.630> it<00:07:53.140> definitely<00:07:53.530> does<00:07:53.680> you<00:07:53.980> know<00:07:54.070> a

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:54.100 
strategy it definitely does you know a

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.730 
strategy it definitely does you know a
lot<00:07:54.310> of<00:07:54.430> damage<00:07:54.840> you<00:07:55.840> can<00:07:55.990> take<00:07:56.140> out<00:07:56.290> a<00:07:56.320> lot<00:07:56.560> of

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:56.740 
lot of damage you can take out a lot of

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:59.010 
lot of damage you can take out a lot of
a<00:07:57.010> lot<00:07:57.520> of<00:07:57.550> basis<00:07:57.970> with<00:07:58.120> all<00:07:58.270> just<00:07:58.540> all<00:07:58.750> Fiza
