00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:09.559 
interesting the x-band for the genesis

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.030 
interesting the x-band for the genesis
the<00:00:10.559> x-band<00:00:10.950> for<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.370> Genesis<00:00:11.910> has<00:00:12.269> a<00:00:13.009> ray<00:00:14.009> of

the x-band for the Genesis has a ray of
seven<00:00:14.849> LEDs<00:00:15.360> on<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.750> front<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.230> I've<00:00:16.890> heard

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
seven LEDs on the front of it I've heard

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.150 
seven LEDs on the front of it I've heard
that<00:00:17.250> these<00:00:17.640> um<00:00:18.439> when<00:00:19.439> hooked<00:00:19.710> up<00:00:19.890> properly

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
that these um when hooked up properly

and<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.970> different<00:00:21.300> firmware<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:21.840> loaded<00:00:22.230> on

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
and the different firmware is loaded on

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.160 
and the different firmware is loaded on
there<00:00:22.640> it<00:00:23.640> can<00:00:24.000> be<00:00:24.150> used<00:00:24.330> as<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.600> development

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
there it can be used as a development

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.950 
there it can be used as a development
unit<00:00:26.390> but<00:00:27.390> during<00:00:27.900> normal<00:00:28.220> operation<00:00:29.220> the

unit but during normal operation the

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:48.729 
unit but during normal operation the
x-band<00:00:31.489> lights<00:00:32.489> do<00:00:32.820> some<00:00:33.059> interesting<00:00:33.630> things

right there is the title screen for the
x-band<00:00:52.940> it<00:00:53.940> just<00:00:54.179> kind<00:00:54.359> of<00:00:54.420> pulsates<00:00:58.969> here<00:00:59.969> i

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
x-band it just kind of pulsates here i

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.149
