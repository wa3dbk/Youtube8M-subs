we had that opportunity here I enrolled
here<00:00:25.320> at<00:00:25.410> fiu<00:00:25.769> back<00:00:26.279> in<00:00:26.430> 2004<00:00:27.380> at<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.590> time<00:00:28.859> I

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
here at fiu back in 2004 at that time I

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.669 
here at fiu back in 2004 at that time I
wanted<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.580> do<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:29.970> chose<00:00:30.480> chemistry<00:00:31.019> because<00:00:31.230> I

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
wanted to do I chose chemistry because I

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.590 
wanted to do I chose chemistry because I
noticed<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:32.880> when<00:00:33.149> i<00:00:33.180> came<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.480> united

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
noticed that when i came to united

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.870 
noticed that when i came to united
states<00:00:34.040> even<00:00:35.040> though<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.309> language<00:00:35.640> wasn't

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
states even though the language wasn't

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.080 
states even though the language wasn't
the<00:00:36.090> same<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.960> sciences<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:37.950> math<00:00:38.340> were

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
the same the sciences and the math were

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.470 
the same the sciences and the math were
the<00:00:39.270> same<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:40.230> i<00:00:40.260> was<00:00:40.500> able<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.950> kind<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.790> do

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
the same so i was able to kind of do

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.910 
the same so i was able to kind of do
that<00:00:42.629> transition<00:00:43.200> even<00:00:43.559> though<00:00:43.680> there<00:00:43.800> was<00:00:43.890> a

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
that transition even though there was a

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.680 
that transition even though there was a
language<00:00:44.309> barriers<00:00:44.640> through<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.239> sciences

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
language barriers through the sciences

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.720 
language barriers through the sciences
into<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.140> math<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:47.340> helped<00:00:47.520> me<00:00:47.610> out<00:00:47.670> a

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
into the math and that helped me out a

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.510 
into the math and that helped me out a
lot<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.270> was<00:00:49.230> pretty<00:00:49.410> good<00:00:49.559> in<00:00:49.680> chemistry<00:00:50.489> I

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
lot so I was pretty good in chemistry I

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.110 
lot so I was pretty good in chemistry I
chose<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.210> chose<00:00:51.660> chemistry<00:00:52.199> as<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.710> major

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
chose to I chose chemistry as a major

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.189 
chose to I chose chemistry as a major
even<00:00:54.120> though<00:00:54.329> in<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.660> back<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.870> my<00:00:54.899> mind<00:00:55.079> I

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
even though in the back of my mind I

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.350 
even though in the back of my mind I
always<00:00:55.230> wanted<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.770> do<00:00:55.890> medicine<00:00:56.210> that's<00:00:57.210> one

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
always wanted to do medicine that's one

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.450 
always wanted to do medicine that's one
of<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.510> great<00:00:57.800> great<00:00:58.800> opportunities<00:00:59.280> here<00:00:59.430> at
