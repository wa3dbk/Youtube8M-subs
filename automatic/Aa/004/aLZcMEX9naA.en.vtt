00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:08.010
 Yes everyone has been a long time 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.010
 Let's look at this for now 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.600
 I'm refreshing 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:20.370
 The computer was broken about last month 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:24.470
 It seems that I could not restore the data well 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:29.850
 Not disappeared one-Like all 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:35.600
 The file itself remains properly like this 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:43.600
 I just do not know which file is not displayed due to 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:43.600
 There is also a way to move only files, but it is officially dealt with 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:52.210
 The only safe map for prototypes 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.210
 Do you want to see 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.310
 Then 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:04.740
 Yes i wonder 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.740
 The field that was super flat turned into wonderful terrain 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.280
 Let the time being try flying to 0 coordinate 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:27.140
 By the way, if you are familiar with the topography of this area, it is great 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.140
 This place I used to find diamonds 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.100
 Somehow there is a torch 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:40.930
 Yes the first map 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.930
 I do not know Toka or why became this truly 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.640
 Take 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.470
 There 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.430
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.430
 Bolongo Chiroru 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.580
 It said it was Me-chan healthy 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:09.780
 Does not mean that the prototype map was replaced with this map 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.459
 So it warps a little further and becomes super flat 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.950
 It looks like this 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.840
 me 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.520
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.370
 Well because there 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:47.549
 Jump likely absolute 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.549
 The coordinates of the time that had made the Yes prototype 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:56.170
 Maybe there would be going to that coordinates 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.170
 let's see 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.939
 Yes no 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:10.340
 Try copying it once more from the data restored over about 10,000 yen when your computer is broken 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.340
 I will 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.030
 Hmm 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.500
 Yes this is backup save data 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:26.030
 Hmm 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:26.030
 If this in useless if prototype map is completely rid 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.700
 Yes I copy has been completed 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.060
 Well now 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:51.590
 It is impossible 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.590
 It seems that only the items on hand can be restored somehow 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.110
 Yes Prototype Map Thank you so far 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:07.820
 Main has made a map of survival once 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.820
 I will try to put only chunks 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.570
 Don't note the seed value 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:23.430
 For now let's go with this 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.430
 The data 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.020
 Yatter 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.070
 What kind of thing 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:38.880
 The player data reduction had broken in short 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.880
 It is something to display the world name 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.230
 Well, for the time being 

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:47.849
 I'm home 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:53.870
 I Oh Oh Oh 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.580
 Good links 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:05:00.199
 It's Eugenio its 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.199
 I do not know Chomayo 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.550
 Oh oh oh oh 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:14.130
 It feels like it ended with a trap at the end of all parts somehow 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.860
 can not fly 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.860
 Right 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:28.080
 me 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.080
 wh 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.070
 Ah 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.030
 Kimi 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.930
 Maybe 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.930
 links kiter 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:45.570
 Yes The joy now corresponds to 1500 diamonds 

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:50.119
 I'll go home with links 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:58.629
 Whoa 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.629
 Cormorant 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:06.510
 that 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:09.440
 links ok 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:16.960
 A tail is down 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:16.960
 Speaking of which , I can see the strength of the ship by the fall of the shippo 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:24.740
 Hey! 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.740
 Oh fuel undue importance not 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:34.810
 Hmm 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:49.910
 And after this I tried hard to fix the hand-held item but it was impossible 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:53.510
 It may be taken out by a cheat because it is subtle that animation disappears 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:57.130
 Play style like diamond silk pickels 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:57.130
 It is hard to remake 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:02.510
 That's why this time is over 

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:10.230
 Well then Lynx will come again later 

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:10.230
 Yes bye bye bye
