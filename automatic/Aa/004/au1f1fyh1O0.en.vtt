urgent environmental issues and yes we

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.460 
urgent environmental issues and yes we
respond<00:03:06.010> with<00:03:06.130> higher<00:03:06.490> power<00:03:06.880> but<00:03:07.480> also<00:03:07.720> with

respond with higher power but also with

lower fuel consumption a contradiction

lower fuel consumption a contradiction
not<00:03:12.160> at<00:03:12.280> all<00:03:12.480> it's<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.660> principle<00:03:14.230> we<00:03:14.380> call
