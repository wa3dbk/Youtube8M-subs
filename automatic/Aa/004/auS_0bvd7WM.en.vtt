00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.890
 hello welcome my name is Andrea 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.200
 this is simple 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.540
 and today we will cook remaining milk 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.020
 condensed the ingredients are the 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.020
 following 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.860
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.750
 put in a bowl 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.580
 and I recommend that all this part the 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.920
 do with machine already but so that 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:37.700
 You can pass me through problems of 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.670
 sound I'm going to do it with machine is that 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.580
 it's super fast and it's super rich 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:47.540
 final and here I have condensed milk 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.710
 and from where to put the butter what 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.440
 Ideal is that the butter is 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.690
 room temperature because very hard 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.970
 It costs that you mess with the milk 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.950
 condensed already here I have a 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.110
 little more than room temperature 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.720
 because I'm going to do it with the marq and what 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:06.610
 it has cost me a bit more to stir 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.610
 with machine do the same 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:15.250
 Y 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:17.380
 stir well until everything is mixed 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.120
 despite being a milk puddle 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.510
 condensed one could think that is 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.000
 very sweet but the sun is perfect and 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.220
 I must say that the mass is a little more 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.260
 white and a little more spongy too 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.510
 we have well here mixed milk 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.290
 condensed with the butter and 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.290
 we are the eggs 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.160
 we stir well 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:53.710
 Now let's add the mixed flour 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.980
 previously with the ambient powders already 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.140
 good 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.700
 many people liked the flour that 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.130
 comes already with baking powder 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.600
 I always prefer the nascent and 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.280
 Polish poles in that case is always 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.090
 a teaspoon of the body great for 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.090
 a cup of flour 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.690
 let's throw it with a strainer that 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.800
 it is always easier to stir about everything 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.800
 if I'm doing it the pulse 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.760
 cheating the mass 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.870
 a totally common and wild brand 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.870
 nothing nothing great 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.099
 but I must say that 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.350
 it's a much quicker thing to do 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.050
 that the others 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:05.920
 the common mass of that of being beating 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:09.040
 the yolks with the sugar after cast the 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:14.520
 clear sometimes beaten every snow change 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.520
 this was ready in a few minutes 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.530
 always return from the bottom towards 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:25.780
 up so that 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:30.510
 down we have our molds here 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:33.890
 like a mold and we throw it 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.890
 here moving down 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.430
 here we have our cake ready 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.560
 condensed milk now the only thing that 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.130
 it needs to be taken to the oven for 20 minutes and 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.130
 I would be ready 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.670
 quite 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.650
 well reitor now is to prove it 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:27.819
 light and his face 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:32.680
 not being a very sweet traveler like that 

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:39.660
 which is for all programs 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:42.990
 subscribe share comment is easy 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.990
