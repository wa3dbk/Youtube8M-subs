00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
there for 5 to 10 seconds after there is

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.229 
there for 5 to 10 seconds after there is
no<00:00:42.809> movement<00:00:43.200> for<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.410> long<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:44.280> will<00:00:44.489> go

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
no movement for that long it will go

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.940 
no movement for that long it will go
automatically<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:45.989> lock<00:00:46.170> mode<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.710> then<00:00:46.860> you

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
automatically in lock mode and then you

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.380 
automatically in lock mode and then you
have<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.190> unlock<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.579> device<00:00:47.670> again<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.180> also

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
have to unlock the device again and also

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.000 
have to unlock the device again and also
there's<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.570> microphone<00:00:48.989> built<00:00:49.500> in<00:00:49.739> right

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
mouse in mice and of course as you can

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.490 
mouse in mice and of course as you can
see<00:01:06.030> here<00:01:06.210> it's<00:01:06.360> laser<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:07.020> here's<00:01:07.229> again<00:01:07.439> I

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
see here it's laser so here's again I

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.380 
see here it's laser so here's again I
mean<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:08.250> 913<00:01:10.400> T<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.820> can<00:01:12.000> see<00:01:12.150> here<00:01:12.299> from

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
mean the 913 T and you can see here from

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.210 
mean the 913 T and you can see here from
the<00:01:12.540> side<00:01:12.689> we<00:01:12.869> have<00:01:13.049> on<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.350> side<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.799> think<00:01:13.890> a

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
the side we have on this side I think a

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.350 
the side we have on this side I think a
Kensington<00:01:14.430> lock<00:01:14.700> but<00:01:15.000> it's<00:01:15.150> interesting

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
Kensington lock but it's interesting

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.820 
Kensington lock but it's interesting
because<00:01:15.689> there<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.530> actually<00:01:16.799> another

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
because there is actually another

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.679 
because there is actually another
Kensington<00:01:17.670> lock<00:01:17.790> on<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.420> back

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:19.689 
Kensington lock on the back

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:21.480 
Kensington lock on the back
on<00:01:19.749> the<00:01:20.020> right-hand<00:01:20.619> side<00:01:20.710> right<00:01:21.039> there<00:01:21.070> so

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
on the right-hand side right there so

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.330 
on the right-hand side right there so
you<00:01:21.579> can<00:01:21.759> see<00:01:21.969> also<00:01:22.179> behalf<00:01:22.689> here<00:01:23.079> power<00:01:23.740> and

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
you can see also behalf here power and

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.399 
you can see also behalf here power and
DVI<00:01:24.850> a<00:01:25.299> USB<00:01:26.020> 3<00:01:26.289> twice<00:01:26.590> another<00:01:27.460> 2<00:01:27.880> x<00:01:28.210> USB<00:01:28.359> 2<00:01:28.840> and

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
DVI a USB 3 twice another 2 x USB 2 and

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.039 
DVI a USB 3 twice another 2 x USB 2 and
then<00:01:29.560> of<00:01:29.740> course<00:01:29.770> lon<00:01:30.280> import<00:01:31.179> a<00:01:31.390> smart<00:01:31.810> card

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
then of course lon import a smart card

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:35.069 
then of course lon import a smart card
reader<00:01:32.229> and<00:01:32.469> another<00:01:32.890> 2<00:01:33.219> USB<00:01:33.640> 3<00:01:33.909> ports<00:01:34.840> a

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 
reader and another 2 USB 3 ports a

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:37.889 
reader and another 2 USB 3 ports a
microphone<00:01:35.829> and<00:01:36.100> a<00:01:36.700> headphone<00:01:37.270> port<00:01:37.479> and

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
microphone and a headphone port and

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:38.940 
microphone and a headphone port and
that's<00:01:37.959> actually<00:01:38.350> it<00:01:38.409> from<00:01:38.590> the<00:01:38.679> device<00:01:38.799> and

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
that's actually it from the device and

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.830 
that's actually it from the device and
now<00:01:39.219> what's<00:01:39.369> really<00:01:39.819> interesting<00:01:39.969> is<00:01:40.299> that<00:01:40.329> if

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
now what's really interesting is that if

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.260 
now what's really interesting is that if
you<00:01:41.020> then<00:01:41.530> will<00:01:41.829> work<00:01:42.099> with<00:01:42.429> clients<00:01:42.849> you<00:01:43.149> can

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
you then will work with clients you can

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.319 
you then will work with clients you can
