toxicities<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.140> a<00:00:22.140> couple<00:00:22.800> things<00:00:23.010> I'd<00:00:23.130> like

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
toxicities and a couple things I'd like

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.910 
toxicities and a couple things I'd like
to<00:00:23.460> ask<00:00:23.580> about<00:00:23.760> one<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.210> diabetes<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.470> statins

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
to ask about one is diabetes and statins

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.529 
to ask about one is diabetes and statins
so<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.099> need<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.490> worry<00:00:26.699> about<00:00:26.849> if<00:00:27.090> I'm<00:00:27.210> giving<00:00:27.480> a

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
so I need to worry about if I'm giving a

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.029 
so I need to worry about if I'm giving a
patient<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:27.960> standing<00:00:28.349> at<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.590> develop

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
patient of standing at the develop

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.339 
patient of standing at the develop
diabetes<00:00:29.250> well<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:30.240> think<00:00:30.359> your<00:00:30.689> worries<00:00:31.080> are

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
diabetes well I think your worries are

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.700 
diabetes well I think your worries are
founded<00:00:32.099> but<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.430> risk<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:32.820> small<00:00:33.260> it<00:00:34.260> back<00:00:34.530> in

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
founded but the risk is small it back in

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.880 
founded but the risk is small it back in
2010<00:00:35.400> the<00:00:36.089> first<00:00:36.360> concrete<00:00:36.989> commentary<00:00:37.650> came

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
2010 the first concrete commentary came

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.189 
2010 the first concrete commentary came
out<00:00:38.040> suggesting<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:38.820> perhaps<00:00:39.330> from<00:00:39.750> one<00:00:40.049> and

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
out suggesting that perhaps from one and

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:43.070 
out suggesting that perhaps from one and
every<00:00:40.409> 250<00:00:41.339> patients<00:00:41.790> we<00:00:42.720> would<00:00:42.900> give<00:00:43.049> a

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.080 
every 250 patients we would give a

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.469 
every 250 patients we would give a
statin<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.799> that<00:00:44.369> we<00:00:44.489> would<00:00:44.670> get<00:00:44.790> new<00:00:45.089> onset

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:45.479 
statin to that we would get new onset

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:47.329 
statin to that we would get new onset
diabetes<00:00:45.869> more<00:00:46.559> recently<00:00:46.949> that's<00:00:47.190> been

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:47.339 
diabetes more recently that's been

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:49.189 
diabetes more recently that's been
revised<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.150> numbers<00:00:48.420> even<00:00:48.540> smaller<00:00:48.960> one

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:49.199 
revised and the numbers even smaller one

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:51.829 
revised and the numbers even smaller one
in<00:00:49.290> 500<00:00:49.820> probably<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.940> most<00:00:51.059> important<00:00:51.659> thing

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:51.839 
in 500 probably the most important thing

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:53.750 
in 500 probably the most important thing
to<00:00:51.869> remember<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:52.589> even<00:00:53.309> though<00:00:53.549> there<00:00:53.729> is

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
to remember is that even though there is

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.570 
to remember is that even though there is
a<00:00:53.909> very<00:00:54.269> small<00:00:54.390> risk<00:00:55.080> of<00:00:55.350> new-onset<00:00:56.070> diabetes

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.580 
a very small risk of new-onset diabetes

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.240 
a very small risk of new-onset diabetes
actually<00:00:57.510> induced<00:00:57.869> by<00:00:58.049> the<00:00:58.080> statin<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:59.129> is

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
actually induced by the statin that is

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.549 
actually induced by the statin that is
so<00:00:59.460> far<00:00:59.790> outweighed<00:01:00.360> by<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.659> cardiovascular

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
so far outweighed by the cardiovascular

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.320 
so far outweighed by the cardiovascular
risk<00:01:01.799> reduction<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.339> the<00:01:02.369> Stephanie<00:01:02.790> that<00:01:03.210> it

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.330 
risk reduction of the Stephanie that it

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.969 
risk reduction of the Stephanie that it
should<00:01:03.510> not<00:01:03.689> change<00:01:03.930> clinical<00:01:04.470> practice<00:01:04.860> at

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
should not change clinical practice at

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.070 
should not change clinical practice at
all<00:01:05.100> another<00:01:06.030> insight<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.720> think<00:01:06.930> will

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
all another insight that I think will

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.279 
all another insight that I think will
help<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.530> reassure<00:01:08.250> clinicians<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.780> the

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:10.289 
help to reassure clinicians is that the

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:12.289 
help to reassure clinicians is that the
majority<00:01:10.469> of<00:01:10.829> the<00:01:10.920> folks<00:01:11.130> who<00:01:11.460> did<00:01:11.759> get<00:01:12.060> new

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
majority of the folks who did get new

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.899 
majority of the folks who did get new
ansa<00:01:12.659> tidiness<00:01:13.020> we're<00:01:13.619> actually

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
ansa tidiness we're actually

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:15.830 
ansa tidiness we're actually
pre-diabetic<00:01:14.909> when<00:01:15.060> they<00:01:15.149> started<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.570> stats

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
pre-diabetic when they started the stats

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.929 
pre-diabetic when they started the stats
so<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.530> may<00:01:16.710> not<00:01:16.890> really<00:01:17.130> be<00:01:17.219> that<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.609> statin

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
so it may not really be that the statin

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.719 
so it may not really be that the statin
is<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.149> much<00:01:18.299> causing<00:01:18.869> diabetes<00:01:19.469> as

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
is so much causing diabetes as

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.069 
is so much causing diabetes as
accelerating<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.939> process<00:01:21.509> for<00:01:21.539> people<00:01:21.990> who

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:22.079 
accelerating that process for people who

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:23.569 
accelerating that process for people who
are<00:01:22.200> going<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.469> go<00:01:22.590> for<00:01:22.770> pre-diabetes<00:01:23.280> 2

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:23.579

first came out you know we got liver

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.399 
first came out you know we got liver
function<00:01:35.460> studies<00:01:35.880> when<00:01:36.539> we<00:01:36.630> start<00:01:36.929> them<00:01:37.200> when

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
function studies when we start them when

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.840 
function studies when we start them when
we<00:01:37.469> go<00:01:37.590> every<00:01:37.799> two<00:01:37.950> or<00:01:38.039> three<00:01:38.100> months<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.729> if

we go every two or three months and if
they<00:01:38.999> got<00:01:39.179> elevated<00:01:39.600> we<00:01:40.109> stopped<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.619> stand<00:01:40.920> so

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:41.609 
they got elevated we stopped to stand so

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:43.849 
they got elevated we stopped to stand so

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
is that the elevation tonalities we saw

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.239 
is that the elevation tonalities we saw
in<00:02:03.479> clinical<00:02:03.840> trials<00:02:03.959> were<00:02:04.619> actually<00:02:04.920> just<00:02:04.979> as

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
necessarily again with another so it's

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.750 
necessarily again with another so it's
worth<00:03:48.660> a<00:03:48.810> trial<00:03:49.170> of<00:03:49.440> a<00:03:49.800> different<00:03:50.100> step<00:03:50.310> to<00:03:50.580> see

worth a trial of a different step to see

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.850

that one would be better tolerated and
