00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
the camera and recording the game at the

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.309 
the camera and recording the game at the
same<00:02:10.170> time<00:02:10.380> so<00:02:10.649> my<00:02:10.799> bad<00:02:10.979> i<00:02:11.009> apologize<00:02:12.200> you<00:02:13.200> can

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
same time so my bad i apologize you can

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.050 
same time so my bad i apologize you can
now<00:02:13.440> look<00:02:13.650> down<00:02:13.860> here<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.430> we're<00:02:14.640> actually<00:02:14.700> up

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
now look down here and we're actually up

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.890 
now look down here and we're actually up
to<00:02:16.370> 15<00:02:17.370> as<00:02:17.700> opposed<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.299> the<00:02:18.420> nine<00:02:18.569> that<00:02:18.720> we<00:02:18.780> had

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
to 15 as opposed to the nine that we had

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.750 
to 15 as opposed to the nine that we had
earlier<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.380> so<00:02:20.040> this<00:02:20.190> is<00:02:20.310> basically<00:02:20.459> the

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
earlier and so this is basically the

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.949 
earlier and so this is basically the
game<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.120> there's<00:02:21.269> just<00:02:21.420> a<00:02:21.510> lot<00:02:21.599> of<00:02:21.660> different

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
game and there's just a lot of different

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.620 
game and there's just a lot of different
creatures<00:02:22.049> there's<00:02:22.470> mosquitoes<00:02:23.400> that<00:02:24.120> come

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
creatures there's mosquitoes that come

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.449 
creatures there's mosquitoes that come
in<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.079> are<00:02:25.200> very<00:02:25.440> challenging<00:02:26.069> because<00:02:26.220> they

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
in and are very challenging because they

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.550 
in and are very challenging because they
constantly<00:02:26.819> are<00:02:26.970> dodging<00:02:27.239> and<00:02:27.480> moving<00:02:27.780> there

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
constantly are dodging and moving there

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.640 
constantly are dodging and moving there
are<00:02:29.120> moths<00:02:30.120> that<00:02:30.480> if<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:30.930> turn<00:02:31.170> on<00:02:31.319> a<00:02:31.349> light

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
are moths that if you turn on a light

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.500 
are moths that if you turn on a light
they'll<00:02:32.400> swarm<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.030> light<00:02:33.209> so<00:02:33.390> they're

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
they'll swarm to the light so they're

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.030 
they'll swarm to the light so they're
easier<00:02:33.810> to<00:02:33.870> capture<00:02:34.140> which<00:02:35.010> is<00:02:35.160> lots<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.489> fun

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
easier to capture which is lots of fun

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.539 
easier to capture which is lots of fun

ah miss them and they often leave the

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.620 
ah miss them and they often leave the
level<00:03:02.250> so<00:03:02.639> you<00:03:02.730> get<00:03:02.910> extra<00:03:03.180> points<00:03:03.389> there's

get them now as you progress through the
levels<00:03:07.739> you<00:03:08.609> can<00:03:08.639> see<00:03:08.940> where<00:03:09.150> they<00:03:09.269> start<00:03:09.540> you

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
levels you can see where they start you

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.069 
levels you can see where they start you

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
forth as you go through the levels and

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:18.740 
forth as you go through the levels and
then<00:03:17.760> like<00:03:17.940> I<00:03:17.970> said<00:03:18.209> there's<00:03:18.359> some<00:03:18.510> sort<00:03:18.630> of

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
end there's about 35 i think some odd

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.000 
end there's about 35 i think some odd
levels<00:03:23.790> is<00:03:23.940> a<00:03:23.970> fair<00:03:24.269> amount<00:03:24.650> so<00:03:25.650> it's<00:03:25.769> lots<00:03:25.920> of

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
levels is a fair amount so it's lots of

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.190 
levels is a fair amount so it's lots of
fun<00:03:26.069> very<00:03:26.700> relaxing<00:03:27.329> there's<00:03:27.540> no<00:03:27.630> time<00:03:27.930> limit
