the walking pin issue that ours did but
we<00:00:33.930> put<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.140> tech<00:00:34.500> on<00:00:34.769> 3m<00:00:35.100> our<00:00:35.250> trigger<00:00:35.519> in<00:00:35.699> this

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
we put a tech on 3m our trigger in this

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.780 
we put a tech on 3m our trigger in this
one<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.839> we're<00:00:37.019> gonna<00:00:37.110> go<00:00:37.290> ahead<00:00:37.379> and<00:00:37.699> test<00:00:38.699> it

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
one so we're gonna go ahead and test it

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:53.329 
one so we're gonna go ahead and test it
out<00:00:38.909> and<00:00:39.089> see<00:00:39.329> how<00:00:39.449> it<00:00:39.480> goes<00:00:52.010> I'm<00:00:53.010> gonna<00:00:53.189> go

pretty<00:01:10.710> fast<00:01:11.009> with<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.369> tech<00:01:11.579> con<00:01:12.020> but<00:01:13.020> we're

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
pretty fast with the tech con but we're

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.270 
pretty fast with the tech con but we're
gonna<00:01:13.229> throw<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.439> couple<00:01:13.590> more<00:01:13.710> Mac's<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.159> it

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
we can actually pick up some speed

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.890 
we can actually pick up some speed
bullet<00:01:17.790> all<00:01:18.270> right<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:18.509> we're<00:01:18.630> gonna<00:01:18.689> try

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
bullet all right so we're gonna try

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.099 
bullet all right so we're gonna try
another<00:01:19.680> mag<00:01:19.950> here<00:01:20.280> magazine<00:01:20.970> tube<00:01:21.329> I'm<00:01:21.960> gonna

another mag here magazine tube I'm gonna

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:24.859 
another mag here magazine tube I'm gonna
try<00:01:22.289> to<00:01:22.319> pick<00:01:22.560> up<00:01:22.649> the<00:01:22.799> speed<00:01:23.039> each<00:01:23.369> time<00:01:23.869> you

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
try to pick up the speed each time you

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.840 
try to pick up the speed each time you
watched<00:01:25.049> our<00:01:25.259> review<00:01:25.560> on<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.770> tack<00:01:25.979> on<00:01:26.219> you'll

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
watched our review on the tack on you'll

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.419 
watched our review on the tack on you'll
know<00:01:26.999> that<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.270> does<00:01:27.420> take<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.659> little<00:01:27.840> practice

00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:28.429 
know that it does take a little practice

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:33.200 
know that it does take a little practice
to<00:01:29.429> get<00:01:29.520> really<00:01:29.819> good<00:01:29.999> with<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:31.999> back<00:01:32.999> to<00:01:33.149> the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
to get really good with it back to the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:45.080 
to get really good with it back to the
center<00:01:33.359> position<00:01:34.579> gun<00:01:35.579> all<00:01:35.729> much

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.279 

that's<00:01:46.090> pretty<00:01:46.270> quick<00:01:46.450> for<00:01:46.750> a<00:01:46.780> 30<00:01:47.020> rounder<00:01:47.530> so

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
that's pretty quick for a 30 rounder so

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:51.330 
that's pretty quick for a 30 rounder so
not<00:01:50.289> bad<00:01:50.409> I<00:01:50.560> think<00:01:50.740> we<00:01:50.799> did<00:01:50.920> pick<00:01:51.100> it<00:01:51.189> up<00:01:51.280> a

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
not bad I think we did pick it up a

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.109 
not bad I think we did pick it up a
little<00:01:51.399> bit<00:01:51.549> on<00:01:51.670> that<00:01:51.700> one

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
little bit on that one

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:53.910 
little bit on that one
but<00:01:52.659> we'll<00:01:52.990> do<00:01:53.049> a<00:01:53.110> couple<00:01:53.200> more<00:01:53.439> and<00:01:53.500> see<00:01:53.829> how

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
but we'll do a couple more and see how

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.580 
but we'll do a couple more and see how
we<00:01:54.009> do<00:01:54.100> with<00:01:54.130> it<00:01:54.340> all<00:01:54.759> right<00:01:54.880> guys<00:01:55.030> so<00:01:55.590> clearly

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
we do with it all right guys so clearly

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.940 
we do with it all right guys so clearly
the<00:01:57.189> gun<00:01:57.399> is<00:01:57.689> faster<00:01:58.689> with<00:01:58.960> the<00:01:59.110> tack<00:01:59.530> on<00:01:59.770> that

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
the gun is faster with the tack on that

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.609 
the gun is faster with the tack on that
it<00:02:00.069> is<00:02:00.189> with<00:02:00.429> just<00:02:00.640> the<00:02:00.819> standard<00:02:01.619> trigger

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
it is with just the standard trigger

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.419 
it is with just the standard trigger
pack<00:02:02.860> that<00:02:03.009> comes<00:02:03.189> in<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:03.729> MPX<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.799> we've<00:02:06.280> got

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
pack that comes in the MPX and we've got

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:07.770 
pack that comes in the MPX and we've got
a<00:02:06.460> lot<00:02:06.610> of<00:02:06.640> questions<00:02:07.060> after<00:02:07.210> the<00:02:07.390> first<00:02:07.600> feel

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
a lot of questions after the first feel

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.009 
a lot of questions after the first feel
that<00:02:07.960> we<00:02:08.050> did<00:02:08.229> is<00:02:08.530> can<00:02:09.519> you<00:02:09.610> consistently<00:02:10.360> hit

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
that we did is can you consistently hit

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.470 
that we did is can you consistently hit
with<00:02:11.260> it<00:02:11.440> and<00:02:11.620> you<00:02:11.890> can<00:02:12.160> in<00:02:12.849> the<00:02:13.000> video<00:02:13.209> that<00:02:13.269> we

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
with it and you can in the video that we

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.750 
with it and you can in the video that we
shot<00:02:13.630> prior<00:02:13.900> to<00:02:14.080> this<00:02:14.280> we<00:02:15.280> were<00:02:15.370> lighting<00:02:15.640> up<00:02:15.670> a

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
shot prior to this we were lighting up a

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.449 
shot prior to this we were lighting up a
steel<00:02:15.970> target<00:02:16.360> from<00:02:16.599> probably<00:02:17.560> 35<00:02:17.950> yards<00:02:18.310> or

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
steel target from probably 35 yards or

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.789 
steel target from probably 35 yards or
so<00:02:18.610> so<00:02:18.940> you<00:02:19.540> can<00:02:19.780> it<00:02:20.019> is<00:02:20.140> easy<00:02:20.349> to<00:02:20.500> keep<00:02:20.620> on

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
so so you can it is easy to keep on

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:22.289 
so so you can it is easy to keep on
target<00:02:21.069> still<00:02:21.430> with<00:02:21.549> the<00:02:21.640> tech<00:02:21.819> con<00:02:22.030> but<00:02:22.180> the

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
target still with the tech con but the

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:24.630 
target still with the tech con but the
tech<00:02:22.480> con<00:02:22.690> does<00:02:22.989> take<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:23.319> finesse<00:02:23.769> and<00:02:24.040> it

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
tech con does take a finesse and it

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.339 
tech con does take a finesse and it
takes<00:02:24.819> a<00:02:24.910> lot<00:02:25.060> of<00:02:25.090> rounds<00:02:25.510> downrange<00:02:25.750> and<00:02:26.230> our

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
takes a lot of rounds downrange and our

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.440 
takes a lot of rounds downrange and our
experience<00:02:26.830> to<00:02:27.519> be<00:02:27.640> able<00:02:27.700> to<00:02:27.790> get<00:02:27.940> really<00:02:28.239> fast

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
experience to be able to get really fast

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.030 
experience to be able to get really fast
with<00:02:28.660> it<00:02:29.190> so<00:02:30.299> we're<00:02:31.299> gonna<00:02:31.420> do<00:02:32.200> a<00:02:32.230> couple<00:02:32.650> of

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
with it so we're gonna do a couple of

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.789 
with it so we're gonna do a couple of
bursts<00:02:33.610> with<00:02:34.329> it<00:02:34.510> maybe<00:02:34.690> three<00:02:35.260> rounds<00:02:35.650> and

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
bursts with it maybe three rounds and

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.880 
bursts with it maybe three rounds and
then<00:02:36.790> we're<00:02:36.910> gonna<00:02:37.000> try<00:02:37.299> to<00:02:37.590> empty<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.739> rest

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
then we're gonna try to empty the rest

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.560 
then we're gonna try to empty the rest
of<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.069> mag

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.620 

so<00:02:45.570> you<00:02:45.660> can<00:02:45.870> see<00:02:46.640> you<00:02:47.640> can<00:02:47.760> ubers<00:02:48.060> pretty<00:02:48.390> easy

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
so you can see you can ubers pretty easy

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.570 
so you can see you can ubers pretty easy
with<00:02:48.900> it<00:02:49.020> and<00:02:49.230> then<00:02:49.380> I'm<00:02:49.500> gonna<00:02:49.590> try<00:02:49.800> to<00:02:49.890> try<00:02:50.550> to

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
with it and then I'm gonna try to try to

00:02:50.580 --> 00:03:00.710 
with it and then I'm gonna try to try to
empty<00:02:50.970> it<00:02:51.060> here<00:02:58.670> it<00:02:59.670> is<00:02:59.850> fun<00:03:00.120> I<00:03:00.330> can<00:03:00.510> tell<00:03:00.660> you

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
empty it here it is fun I can tell you

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.220 
empty it here it is fun I can tell you
that<00:03:00.810> much

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
that much

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.860 
that much
but<00:03:01.500> it<00:03:01.620> is<00:03:01.710> much<00:03:01.980> faster<00:03:02.010> than<00:03:02.810> just<00:03:03.810> a

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
but it is much faster than just a

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.260 
but it is much faster than just a
standard<00:03:04.080> AR<00:03:04.620> trigger<00:03:04.890> now<00:03:05.580> you<00:03:05.640> can<00:03:05.940> get<00:03:06.150> some

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
standard AR trigger now you can get some

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.820 
standard AR trigger now you can get some
really<00:03:06.390> quick<00:03:06.630> speeds<00:03:07.020> with<00:03:07.260> just<00:03:07.500> a<00:03:07.590> really

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
really quick speeds with just a really

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.080 
really quick speeds with just a really
good<00:03:08.700> light<00:03:09.420> AR<00:03:09.900> trigger<00:03:10.340> like<00:03:11.340> a<00:03:11.370> guys<00:03:11.640> Lee<00:03:11.910> or

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
good light AR trigger like a guys Lee or

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.630 
good light AR trigger like a guys Lee or
Timoney<00:03:12.420> or<00:03:12.540> something<00:03:12.810> like<00:03:12.930> that<00:03:13.400> so<00:03:14.400> it<00:03:14.520> is

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
Timoney or something like that so it is

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.810 
Timoney or something like that so it is
fun<00:03:15.000> to<00:03:15.480> play<00:03:15.660> with<00:03:15.840> I<00:03:16.020> know<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.430> TAC<00:03:17.430> cons<00:03:17.670> are

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
fun to play with I know the TAC cons are

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.250 
fun to play with I know the TAC cons are
very<00:03:18.120> expensive<00:03:20.180> but<00:03:21.180> they<00:03:21.690> are<00:03:21.810> fun<00:03:22.020> to<00:03:22.050> play

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
very expensive but they are fun to play

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:33.690 
very expensive but they are fun to play
with<00:03:23.960> see<00:03:24.960> how<00:03:25.110> it<00:03:25.230> does<00:03:25.410> here

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.180 

pretty<00:03:34.700> quick<00:03:35.560> alright<00:03:36.560> guys<00:03:36.709> so<00:03:36.830> this<00:03:36.950> time

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
pretty quick alright guys so this time

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.130 
pretty quick alright guys so this time
we're<00:03:37.340> going<00:03:37.430> to<00:03:37.489> actually<00:03:37.640> try<00:03:38.000> the<00:03:38.150> tech<00:03:38.870> con

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
we're going to actually try the tech con

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.460 
we're going to actually try the tech con
on<00:03:39.409> the<00:03:39.650> MPX<00:03:40.099> with<00:03:40.819> the<00:03:41.030> brace<00:03:41.330> folded<00:03:42.290> to<00:03:42.440> the

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
on the MPX with the brace folded to the

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.009 
on the MPX with the brace folded to the
side<00:03:42.769> I've<00:03:43.670> never<00:03:43.879> actually<00:03:44.060> shot<00:03:44.390> one<00:03:44.569> with

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
side I've never actually shot one with

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:46.930 
side I've never actually shot one with
the<00:03:45.170> brace<00:03:45.379> folded<00:03:45.920> and<00:03:46.069> not<00:03:46.370> rested<00:03:46.730> against

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
the brace folded and not rested against

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.080 
the brace folded and not rested against
my<00:03:47.060> cheek<00:03:47.269> or<00:03:47.739> out<00:03:48.739> of<00:03:48.829> a<00:03:48.950> regular<00:03:49.280> standard<00:03:49.970> a

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
my cheek or out of a regular standard a

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.039 
my cheek or out of a regular standard a
are<00:03:50.239> with<00:03:50.450> us<00:03:50.599> stop

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
are with us stop

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.680 
are with us stop
so<00:03:51.260> we'll<00:03:52.010> try<00:03:52.159> it<00:03:52.190> this<00:03:52.340> way<00:03:52.400> and<00:03:52.730> see<00:03:52.940> how

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
so we'll try it this way and see how

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:00.990 
so we'll try it this way and see how
fast<00:03:53.959> we<00:03:54.170> can<00:03:55.000> move<00:03:56.000> the<00:03:56.120> shells<00:03:56.329> this<00:03:56.599> way

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:10.089 

third<00:04:02.000> position<00:04:02.510> I<00:04:08.500> was<00:04:09.500> able<00:04:09.620> to<00:04:09.769> rock<00:04:09.950> it

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
third position I was able to rock it

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:14.619 
third position I was able to rock it
pretty<00:04:10.459> quick<00:04:10.670> that<00:04:10.819> time<00:04:13.329> didn't<00:04:14.329> get<00:04:14.450> hold

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:14.629 
pretty quick that time didn't get hold

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.170 
pretty quick that time didn't get hold
open<00:04:14.870> on<00:04:14.959> the<00:04:15.049> last<00:04:15.230> one<00:04:15.440> but<00:04:15.699> as<00:04:16.699> you<00:04:16.940> can<00:04:17.060> see

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
open on the last one but as you can see

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.599 
open on the last one but as you can see
the<00:04:17.299> more<00:04:17.449> rounds<00:04:17.930> that<00:04:18.019> you<00:04:18.169> put<00:04:18.380> down<00:04:19.010> range

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
the more rounds that you put down range

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.300 
the more rounds that you put down range
with<00:04:20.389> the<00:04:20.510> TAC<00:04:20.660> time<00:04:20.870> the<00:04:21.139> faster<00:04:21.620> you're<00:04:22.039> able

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
with the TAC time the faster you're able

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.900 
with the TAC time the faster you're able
to<00:04:22.520> become<00:04:23.180> with<00:04:23.330> it<00:04:24.610> we'll<00:04:25.610> put<00:04:25.760> a<00:04:25.789> couple

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
to become with it we'll put a couple

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.310 
to become with it we'll put a couple
more<00:04:26.030> max<00:04:26.330> to<00:04:26.510> it<00:04:26.600> and<00:04:26.750> then<00:04:26.900> we'll<00:04:27.050> wrap<00:04:27.260> up

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
more max to it and then we'll wrap up

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.700 
more max to it and then we'll wrap up
the<00:04:27.500> video<00:04:28.030> all<00:04:29.030> right<00:04:29.090> so<00:04:29.449> we're<00:04:30.260> gonna<00:04:30.350> put<00:04:30.680> a

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
the video all right so we're gonna put a

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.290 
the video all right so we're gonna put a
couple<00:04:30.830> more<00:04:31.300> mags<00:04:32.300> to<00:04:32.720> the<00:04:33.400> MPX<00:04:34.400> the<00:04:34.910> sig<00:04:35.180> MPX

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
couple more mags to the MPX the sig MPX

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.029 
couple more mags to the MPX the sig MPX
and<00:04:35.840> the<00:04:36.020> tech<00:04:36.320> con<00:04:36.669> trigger<00:04:37.669> here<00:04:37.880> and<00:04:39.039> just

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:40.039 
and the tech con trigger here and just

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:41.589 
and the tech con trigger here and just
see<00:04:40.460> how<00:04:40.490> quick<00:04:40.760> we<00:04:40.910> can<00:04:41.030> actually<00:04:41.150> get<00:04:41.360> it<00:04:41.479> now

00:04:41.589 --> 00:04:41.599 
see how quick we can actually get it now

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:45.279 
see how quick we can actually get it now
the<00:04:41.660> last<00:04:42.789> setup<00:04:43.789> that<00:04:43.910> we<00:04:44.030> shot<00:04:44.300> was<00:04:44.840> with<00:04:45.080> the

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.289 
the last setup that we shot was with the

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:47.770 
the last setup that we shot was with the
brace<00:04:45.590> folded<00:04:46.190> to<00:04:46.340> the<00:04:46.430> side<00:04:46.669> and<00:04:47.479> I<00:04:47.570> was<00:04:47.690> able

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
brace folded to the side and I was able

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.420 
brace folded to the side and I was able
to<00:04:47.930> actually<00:04:48.289> move<00:04:48.590> it<00:04:48.740> pretty<00:04:48.919> quick<00:04:49.190> I<00:04:49.400> think

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
to actually move it pretty quick I think

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.450 
to actually move it pretty quick I think
was<00:04:49.700> actually<00:04:49.880> easier<00:04:50.419> for<00:04:50.660> me<00:04:51.130> in<00:04:52.130> that

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
was actually easier for me in that

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.260 
was actually easier for me in that
configuration<00:04:53.450> so<00:04:54.550> but<00:04:55.550> I'm<00:04:55.669> gonna<00:04:55.760> brace

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
configuration so but I'm gonna brace

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.390 
configuration so but I'm gonna brace
against<00:04:56.570> my<00:04:56.660> cheek<00:04:56.810> again<00:04:57.110> and<00:04:57.289> try<00:04:57.470> see<00:04:58.190> if<00:04:58.340> I

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
against my cheek again and try see if I

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:27.159 
against my cheek again and try see if I
can<00:04:58.930> try<00:04:59.930> to<00:04:59.990> match<00:05:00.260> that<00:05:00.289> speed

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:31.790 

and<00:05:28.169> I<00:05:28.289> will<00:05:28.710> do<00:05:28.879> so<00:05:30.259> getting<00:05:31.259> some<00:05:31.469> pretty

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
and I will do so getting some pretty

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.719 
and I will do so getting some pretty
quick<00:05:32.419> shots<00:05:33.419> here<00:05:33.629> with<00:05:33.810> the<00:05:33.960> tech<00:05:34.379> gun<00:05:34.729> all

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
quick shots here with the tech gun all

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:37.610

tech<00:05:40.560> con<00:05:40.770> 3m<00:05:41.069> our<00:05:41.219> trigger<00:05:41.599> we<00:05:42.599> have

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
tech con 3m our trigger we have

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
through this so we have quite a bit of

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.950

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
put the tech con in position to which

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:55.850 
put the tech con in position to which
you<00:05:53.879> have<00:05:53.909> safe<00:05:54.300> first<00:05:54.960> position<00:05:55.409> third

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
you have safe first position third

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.980 
you have safe first position third
position<00:05:56.029> and<00:05:57.029> I'm<00:05:57.360> going<00:05:57.479> to<00:05:57.509> pull<00:05:57.870> the

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990 
position and I'm going to pull the

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.209 
position and I'm going to pull the
trigger<00:05:58.080> as<00:05:58.259> fast<00:05:58.439> I<00:05:58.560> can<00:05:58.740> just<00:05:58.949> to<00:05:59.009> show<00:05:59.159> you

00:05:59.209 --> 00:05:59.219 
trigger as fast I can just to show you

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:02.510 
trigger as fast I can just to show you
guys<00:05:59.400> the<00:06:00.240> difference<00:06:01.219> so<00:06:02.219> let's<00:06:02.339> go<00:06:02.460> ahead

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
guys the difference so let's go ahead

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:14.029 
guys the difference so let's go ahead
and<00:06:02.909> do<00:06:03.029> that<00:06:03.150> now<00:06:12.319> the<00:06:13.319> second<00:06:13.650> position

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:14.039 
and do that now the second position

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:21.440 
and do that now the second position
rested<00:06:14.699> against<00:06:14.909> my<00:06:15.000> cheek

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:21.450 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.580 

that's<00:06:22.450> as<00:06:22.690> fast<00:06:22.870> as<00:06:23.110> I<00:06:23.200> could<00:06:23.290> pull<00:06:23.500> the

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 
that's as fast as I could pull the

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.880 
that's as fast as I could pull the
trigger<00:06:23.620> in<00:06:24.070> the<00:06:24.130> second<00:06:24.580> position<00:06:24.940> so

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:25.890 
trigger in the second position so

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:29.370 
trigger in the second position so
clearly<00:06:27.240> you<00:06:28.240> can<00:06:28.360> get<00:06:28.510> some<00:06:28.660> really<00:06:29.080> fast

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:29.380 
clearly you can get some really fast

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.010 
clearly you can get some really fast
speeds<00:06:30.070> it<00:06:30.280> just<00:06:30.460> takes<00:06:30.750> quite<00:06:31.750> a<00:06:31.810> bit<00:06:31.930> of

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 
speeds it just takes quite a bit of

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.280 
speeds it just takes quite a bit of
practice<00:06:32.380> and<00:06:32.560> a<00:06:32.680> lot<00:06:32.710> of<00:06:33.040> ammo<00:06:33.310> so<00:06:34.110> if<00:06:35.110> you

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:35.290 
practice and a lot of ammo so if you

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:36.990 
practice and a lot of ammo so if you
have<00:06:35.410> the<00:06:35.560> money<00:06:35.680> it's<00:06:36.220> a<00:06:36.340> while<00:06:36.520> it's<00:06:36.880> a
