00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.899 
there's the mine chef sorry so here's
the<00:01:41.470> coordinates<00:01:41.860> for<00:01:41.920> your<00:01:42.100> mine<00:01:42.250> shaft<00:01:42.610> oh

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
the coordinates for your mine shaft oh

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:44.820 
the coordinates for your mine shaft oh
you<00:01:43.720> know<00:01:43.810> what<00:01:43.900> let<00:01:44.020> me<00:01:44.080> put<00:01:44.260> that<00:01:44.350> a<00:01:44.409> torch

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
you know what let me put that a torch

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.020 
you know what let me put that a torch
real<00:01:45.040> quick<00:01:45.280> you're<00:01:45.400> so<00:01:45.520> you<00:01:45.580> can<00:01:45.700> see<00:01:45.850> them<00:01:45.940> a

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
real quick you're so you can see them a

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.330 
real quick you're so you can see them a
little<00:01:46.120> better<00:01:46.800> alright<00:01:47.800> so<00:01:47.950> these<00:01:48.100> are<00:01:48.250> the

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
little better alright so these are the

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.500 
little better alright so these are the
coordinates<00:01:48.460> for<00:01:48.760> the<00:01:48.850> mine<00:01:49.000> check<00:01:49.270> you<00:01:49.390> can

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
coordinates for the mine check you can

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.060 
coordinates for the mine check you can
see<00:01:49.570> on<00:01:49.659> the<00:01:49.750> map<00:01:49.870> it's<00:01:50.110> really<00:01:50.440> not<00:01:50.560> that<00:01:50.620> far

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
see on the map it's really not that far

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.730 
see on the map it's really not that far
and<00:01:51.430> if<00:01:52.360> it<00:01:52.540> goes<00:01:52.659> a<00:01:52.720> little<00:01:53.110> bit<00:01:53.260> deeper

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
and if it goes a little bit deeper

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.170 
and if it goes a little bit deeper
you'll<00:01:53.950> probably<00:01:54.100> of<00:01:54.250> diamonds<00:01:54.640> in<00:01:54.729> here<00:01:54.909> too

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
you'll probably of diamonds in here too

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.440 
you'll probably of diamonds in here too
it's<00:01:55.479> already<00:01:55.690> down<00:01:55.930> the<00:01:56.110> level<00:01:56.290> 24<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:58.030> now<00:01:58.420> i

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
it's already down the level 24 and now i

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.990 
it's already down the level 24 and now i
noticed<00:01:58.990> i<00:01:59.110> did<00:01:59.530> mark<00:01:59.770> a<00:01:59.860> dungeon<00:02:00.370> I<00:02:00.549> didn't

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
noticed i did mark a dungeon I didn't

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.460 
noticed i did mark a dungeon I didn't
remember<00:02:01.120> doing<00:02:01.420> so<00:02:01.570> but<00:02:01.870> i'll<00:02:02.080> go<00:02:02.260> over<00:02:02.290> there

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
remember doing so but i'll go over there

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.719 
remember doing so but i'll go over there
and<00:02:02.590> show<00:02:02.710> you<00:02:02.770> what's<00:02:02.979> in<00:02:03.130> there<00:02:03.310> just<00:02:03.490> though

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
and show you what's in there just though

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.120 
and show you what's in there just though
so<00:02:04.690> you<00:02:04.780> can<00:02:04.900> get<00:02:05.140> a<00:02:05.170> dungeon<00:02:05.590> over<00:02:05.770> here<00:02:05.920> to

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
so you can get a dungeon over here to

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.440 
so you can get a dungeon over here to
maybe<00:02:06.370> it's<00:02:06.580> a<00:02:06.670> sculpt<00:02:07.000> and<00:02:07.120> I<00:02:07.150> don't<00:02:07.330> remember

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
maybe it's a sculpt and I don't remember

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.690 
maybe it's a sculpt and I don't remember
you<00:02:07.930> know<00:02:08.049> get<00:02:08.379> a<00:02:08.409> good<00:02:08.619> skeleton<00:02:08.890> spawn<00:02:09.369> going

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
you know get a good skeleton spawn going

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.230 
you know get a good skeleton spawn going
but<00:02:09.940> let's<00:02:10.270> see<00:02:10.450> come<00:02:11.380> down<00:02:11.590> here<00:02:12.150> it's<00:02:13.150> a

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
this is a really good map I mean got

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.290 
this is a really good map I mean got
some<00:02:56.680> mountains<00:02:57.069> not<00:02:57.400> a<00:02:57.430> bad<00:02:57.640> scenery<00:02:58.060> either

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
so yeah it's a really good map and it's

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.690 
so yeah it's a really good map and it's
all<00:03:01.239> relatively<00:03:02.080> near<00:03:02.560> spawn<00:03:02.980> so<00:03:03.370> I<00:03:03.400> mean<00:03:03.580> it's

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
all relatively near spawn so I mean it's

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.460 
all relatively near spawn so I mean it's
within<00:03:03.910> probably<00:03:04.300> a<00:03:04.480> minute<00:03:04.840> or<00:03:04.930> a<00:03:04.989> spawn<00:03:05.260> you

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
within probably a minute or a spawn you

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.979 
within probably a minute or a spawn you
can't<00:03:05.709> really<00:03:05.890> miss<00:03:06.099> it<00:03:06.340> but<00:03:07.180> yes<00:03:07.450> so<00:03:07.690> I<00:03:07.720> hope

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
can't really miss it but yes so I hope
