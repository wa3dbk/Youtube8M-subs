getting<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.360> hang<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.900> game<00:01:31.079> knowing

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
getting the hang of the game knowing

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.370 
getting the hang of the game knowing
where<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.159> look<00:01:32.430> how<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.150> broken<00:01:33.630> spawns<00:01:33.990> work

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
where to look how the broken spawns work

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.980 
where to look how the broken spawns work
and<00:01:34.650> all<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.950> because<00:01:35.420> if<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.570> think<00:01:36.600> that

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
and all that because if you think that

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.100 
and all that because if you think that
the<00:01:37.110> spawns<00:01:37.380> are<00:01:37.530> fixed<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.130> are<00:01:38.189> just<00:01:38.490> wrong

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
the spawns are fixed you are just wrong

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.899 
the spawns are fixed you are just wrong
although<00:01:40.110> they<00:01:40.560> made<00:01:40.979> some<00:01:41.310> fixes<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:41.790> know

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
although they made some fixes you know

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.319 
although they made some fixes you know
there<00:01:42.060> was<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.240> major<00:01:42.770> major<00:01:43.770> fail<00:01:44.369> which<00:01:44.820> you

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
there was a major major fail which you

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.080 
there was a major major fail which you
know<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.540> first<00:01:45.750> 15<00:01:46.170> seconds<00:01:46.670> players<00:01:47.670> no

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
know the first 15 seconds players no

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.929 
know the first 15 seconds players no
matter<00:01:48.329> what<00:01:48.750> they<00:01:49.680> had<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> fixed<00:01:50.310> spawn<00:01:50.610> so

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
matter what they had a fixed spawn so

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.960 
matter what they had a fixed spawn so
you<00:01:51.030> could<00:01:51.560> look<00:01:52.560> at<00:01:52.829> enemy<00:01:53.250> spawn<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.850> they

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
you could look at enemy spawn and they

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.969 
you could look at enemy spawn and they
would<00:01:54.149> just<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.600> know<00:01:54.630> spawn<00:01:55.110> right<00:01:55.619> into

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979
