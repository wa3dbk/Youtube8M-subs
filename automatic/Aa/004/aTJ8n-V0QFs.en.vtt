to<00:01:42.759> balance<00:01:43.030> the<00:01:43.420> figure<00:01:43.840> out<00:01:43.960> which

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
to balance the figure out which

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.120 
to balance the figure out which
combination<00:01:44.619> of

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
combination of

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.310 
combination of
like<00:01:45.700> to<00:01:45.850> use<00:01:46.000> you<00:01:46.360> also<00:01:46.630> have<00:01:46.840> the<00:01:46.990> really

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
like to use you also have the really

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.959 
like to use you also have the really
cool<00:01:47.500> addition<00:01:47.890> of<00:01:48.039> skylines<00:01:48.520> which<00:01:48.729> helped

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:48.969 
cool addition of skylines which helped

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:50.910 
cool addition of skylines which helped
you<00:01:49.060> move<00:01:49.240> around<00:01:49.390> big<00:01:49.750> areas<00:01:50.229> and<00:01:50.409> you<00:01:50.770> could

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
you move around big areas and you could

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.620 
you move around big areas and you could
drop<00:01:51.130> and<00:01:51.340> perform<00:01:51.670> skylights<00:01:52.180> to<00:01:52.360> it<00:01:52.509> which

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
drop and perform skylights to it which

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.660 
drop and perform skylights to it which
pretty<00:01:52.840> much<00:01:52.930> kills<00:01:53.380> most<00:01:53.560> enemies<00:01:53.979> with<00:01:54.130> 18

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
pretty much kills most enemies with 18

there are also two types of big enemies
which<00:01:57.100> require<00:01:57.430> a<00:01:57.549> little<00:01:57.759> more<00:01:57.909> strategy<00:01:58.570> and

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
which require a little more strategy and

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.419 
which require a little more strategy and
those<00:01:58.929> or<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.350> motorized<00:01:59.860> patriot<00:02:00.310> and
