00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.780
 amy carpis hello i present myself maxim 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.849
 of concepts and 2 1 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.529
 however this little video for my 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.770
 first fishing of the year 2014 in 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:22.509
 hoping to make my first fish the 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.680
 sun rays is present 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.030
 today I have 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.490
 wanting too much to go to the edge of 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.950
 water and then enjoy it for you 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.029
 introduce a novelty concept and 2 m 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.950
 for the year 2014 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.980
 so some people may know me 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.810
 already through facebook alias max 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.270
 cards and others may be familiar 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.060
 but produces on different that are 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.880
 published on different magazines 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.620
 from previous years so the product 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.660
 flagship of concepts two friends simulation to 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.390
 the robbery to the rose pod support theft 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.520
 entirely made of stainless steel 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.590
 but so their hosts fashion games 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.649
 using it will say 80% of my fishing 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.379
 in some places the places where 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.210
 needs a little market or on 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.710
 places a little steep we do not want 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.560
 of 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.790
 trenet a lot of material and especially 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.560
 material law so I fish 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.780
 if like some interviews on pick 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.360
 so I asked myself the question and 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.870
 last and I looked at the 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.280
 subject to try to go out involved a 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.850
 little bit different from what exists on 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.650
 trade 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.550
 so today the spades of the trade 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.140
 have we all 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.760
 count of times some problems if we 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.830
 does not have the stabilizers 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.870
 in fact the pic tends to turn on 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.810
 the human when we have several can be 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.130
 the kit is so I wanted to go out the 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.680
 fashion she a little bit different from this 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.510
 that exists on the trade namely a 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.390
 pic that does not have the same shape that is not 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:51.270
 not round thiennes particular shape to 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.240
 know a t-shape that allows 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.070
 to avoid the rotation of the peak on itself 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.960
 in the soil so 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:04.060
 you see its shape makes it a shape in 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:06.700
 t who avoids this peak is of course 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.500
 adjustable it is entirely made of stainless steel 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.700
 microbeads finish to avoid 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.310
 withdrawals too important 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:17.330
 beautiful sun maximum discretion 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.280
 at the edge of the water of the very robust he 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.400
 weighs about 500 grams and so is 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.050
 provided for two or three cables his 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.000
 setting system is very simple very 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.580
 fast you have an eye here to go 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.410
 the finger and you have a site button 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.330
 he pulls himself who is mounted on springs and 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.569
 so under the action you pull on the 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.269
 button and you can enlarge your pic 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.560
 to fit a little bit every 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.840
 lands you can meet 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.510
 so that's the standard model and then 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.970
 I also wanted to bring small 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.709
 improvements on the standard model there 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.209
 for those who have sensors that 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.209
 have no snack bar team is a 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.880
 little bit of very crowded places a 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.970
 little bit tight brakes let's say I 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.099
 wanted to directly integrate the snack bar 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.959
 on the pic so it's just 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.150
 stainless steel bars that are slid on 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.959
 so we can remove as we want 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.760
 I will personally 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.300
 carry all the time like that and 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.780
 so simply 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.540
 add to say the option of snacks 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.620
 bars to avoid that can especially 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.830
 detector in case of departure a little too much 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.210
 violent so here I hope that for 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.430
 all those who asked me questions 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.620
 regarding the peaks I answered a little 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.379
 little to your questions 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.989
 so that's the system to repeat it on 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:34.780
 loader images shot a missile on 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:37.740
 the on the beauty button and you in them 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.780
 do it here I wish you all 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.790
 the excellent year 2014 at the edge of the water 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.040
 with maximum pleasure 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:48.230
 and then I tell you very soon to 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:51.950
 the presentation of the second free to run 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:55.930
 vote for 2014 which I hope you will like 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.930
 thank you for watching this video
