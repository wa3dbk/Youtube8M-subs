I'd<00:01:24.030> say<00:01:24.270> Jenkinson<00:01:24.960> has<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.650> deal<00:01:25.860> with<00:01:26.009> that

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
I'd say Jenkinson has to deal with that

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.530 
I'd say Jenkinson has to deal with that
even<00:01:26.549> if<00:01:26.670> we<00:01:28.130> 5050<00:01:29.130> 50<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:29.939> there<00:01:30.180> Beaufort

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
even if we 5050 50 in there Beaufort

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.469 
even if we 5050 50 in there Beaufort
fall<00:01:30.720> for<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.409> one<00:01:31.729> because<00:01:32.729> Fabian<00:01:33.270> ski

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
fall for that one because Fabian ski

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.520 
fall for that one because Fabian ski
should<00:01:33.659> have<00:01:33.780> been<00:01:33.900> reading<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.320> lot
