00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.700 
this um the only downfall that I did not
really<00:04:50.620> like<00:04:50.919> about<00:04:51.070> it<00:04:51.250> was<00:04:51.760> you<00:04:52.240> know<00:04:52.710> didn't

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
really like about it was you know didn't

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.420 
really like about it was you know didn't
give<00:04:53.830> me<00:04:53.919> that<00:04:53.979> much<00:04:54.099> slip<00:04:54.760> he<00:04:55.360> gave<00:04:55.570> me<00:04:55.750> slip

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
give me that much slip he gave me slip

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:02.100 
give me that much slip he gave me slip
but<00:04:57.430> not<00:04:57.789> the<00:04:58.570> way<00:04:58.870> how<00:04:59.440> I<00:05:00.389> wanted<00:05:01.389> it<00:05:01.570> to<00:05:01.810> I

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
but not the way how I wanted it to I

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.890 
but not the way how I wanted it to I
guess<00:05:02.710> I<00:05:03.009> should<00:05:03.400> say<00:05:03.580> maybe<00:05:04.479> I<00:05:04.630> should<00:05:04.810> have

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
guess I should say maybe I should have

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.990 
guess I should say maybe I should have
kept<00:05:05.050> it<00:05:05.169> on<00:05:05.229> a<00:05:05.289> little<00:05:05.500> bit<00:05:05.680> longer<00:05:05.860> I<00:05:06.460> don't

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
kept it on a little bit longer I don't

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.529 
kept it on a little bit longer I don't
know<00:05:07.289> but<00:05:08.289> it<00:05:08.860> just<00:05:09.220> did<00:05:09.370> not<00:05:09.400> give<00:05:09.729> me<00:05:09.940> that

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
know but it just did not give me that

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:14.909 
know but it just did not give me that
slip<00:05:11.530> slip<00:05:12.210> that<00:05:13.210> sounds<00:05:13.479> weird<00:05:13.660> anyways<00:05:14.560> and

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
slip slip that sounds weird anyways and

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.510 
slip slip that sounds weird anyways and
the<00:05:15.490> other<00:05:15.639> downfall<00:05:16.150> I<00:05:16.180> don't<00:05:16.330> like<00:05:16.510> is<00:05:16.720> that

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
the other downfall I don't like is that

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.589 
the other downfall I don't like is that
this<00:05:19.080> is<00:05:20.250> the<00:05:21.250> only<00:05:21.370> way<00:05:21.669> how<00:05:21.880> it<00:05:22.060> comes<00:05:22.330> it

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:22.599 
this is the only way how it comes it

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:25.710 
this is the only way how it comes it
doesn't<00:05:22.930> come<00:05:23.139> in<00:05:23.409> a<00:05:23.949> bottle<00:05:24.190> or<00:05:24.639> a<00:05:24.699> jar<00:05:24.880> only

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
doesn't come in a bottle or a jar only

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.020 
doesn't come in a bottle or a jar only
in<00:05:26.260> these<00:05:26.470> little<00:05:26.680> packets<00:05:27.300> which<00:05:29.130> is<00:05:30.130> okay

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
in these little packets which is okay

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.520

00:06:29.619 --> 00:06:29.629 
in here I would say that a little bit

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:34.419 
in here I would say that a little bit
goes<00:06:30.169> a<00:06:30.349> very<00:06:30.409> long<00:06:30.769> way<00:06:30.949> and<00:06:32.110> overall<00:06:33.110> I<00:06:33.469> liked

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:34.429 
goes a very long way and overall I liked

00:06:34.429 --> 00:06:37.809 
goes a very long way and overall I liked
it<00:06:34.699> I<00:06:34.849> really<00:06:35.809> really<00:06:36.169> really<00:06:36.679> did<00:06:37.009> like<00:06:37.549> it

00:06:37.809 --> 00:06:37.819 
it I really really really did like it

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:39.939 
it I really really really did like it
and<00:06:38.179> if<00:06:38.569> they<00:06:38.719> had<00:06:38.959> a<00:06:38.989> bigger<00:06:39.289> bottle<00:06:39.559> I

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:39.949 
and if they had a bigger bottle I

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:44.729 
and if they had a bigger bottle I
probably<00:06:40.699> would<00:06:41.119> substitute<00:06:41.899> that<00:06:42.909> for<00:06:43.909> the

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:44.739 
probably would substitute that for the

00:06:44.739 --> 00:06:46.839 
probably would substitute that for the
replenishing<00:06:45.739> conditioner<00:06:46.279> by<00:06:46.399> the<00:06:46.459> entrance

organic<00:06:51.349> boosting<00:06:51.860> their<00:06:52.039> but<00:06:52.789> I'm<00:06:53.659> always

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:53.989 
organic boosting their but I'm always

organic boosting their but I'm always
honest<00:06:54.589> and<00:06:55.059> the<00:06:56.059> only<00:06:56.360> downfall<00:06:56.569> about<00:06:57.139> that

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:57.860 
honest and the only downfall about that

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.419 
honest and the only downfall about that
particular<00:06:59.229> conditioner<00:07:00.229> is<00:07:00.319> that<00:07:00.559> I<00:07:00.799> feel

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:09.199 
feel like there is a film or some type

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:13.600 
feel like there is a film or some type
of<00:07:10.659> buildup<00:07:11.659> left<00:07:12.349> in<00:07:12.589> my<00:07:12.709> hair<00:07:12.979> after<00:07:13.279> I<00:07:13.399> rinse

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:15.829 
out the refinishing conditioner and I

00:07:15.829 --> 00:07:19.779 
out the refinishing conditioner and I
think<00:07:16.069> it's<00:07:16.219> because<00:07:16.549> it's<00:07:17.539> so<00:07:18.069> protein<00:07:19.069> this

00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:19.789 
think it's because it's so protein this

00:07:19.789 --> 00:07:22.689 
think it's because it's so protein this
I'm<00:07:20.569> assuming<00:07:20.989> it's<00:07:21.559> protein<00:07:21.949> but<00:07:22.369> y'all

00:07:22.689 --> 00:07:22.699 
I'm assuming it's protein but y'all
