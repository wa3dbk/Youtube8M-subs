00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
we don't know any of this but the fact

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.099 
we don't know any of this but the fact
that<00:00:29.279> they<00:00:29.519> put<00:00:29.820> out<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.970> trailer<00:00:30.449> for<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.750> ps4

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
but not the Vita is saddening one

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.240 
but not the Vita is saddening one
because<00:00:34.260> they<00:00:34.320> don't<00:00:34.500> care<00:00:34.710> about<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.920> Vita

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
because they don't care about the Vita

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.299 
because they don't care about the Vita
too<00:00:36.180> because<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:36.960> don't<00:00:37.680> know<00:00:37.770> what<00:00:37.920> else<00:00:38.100> is

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
too because I don't know what else is

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.400 
too because I don't know what else is
but<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:39.510> also<00:00:39.660> make<00:00:39.989> gives<00:00:40.230> me<00:00:40.320> the

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
but that also make gives me the

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.049 
but that also make gives me the
impression<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.860> ps4<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.670> gonna<00:00:41.820> come<00:00:42.030> out
