here's<00:02:16.610> exactly<00:02:17.000> to<00:02:17.270> a<00:02:17.300> pinpoint<00:02:17.569> of<00:02:17.870> what<00:02:18.050> you

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140

I<00:02:32.760> think<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:34.110> whole<00:02:34.440> idea<00:02:34.770> of<00:02:34.830> art<00:02:35.069> is<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.370> keep

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
I think the whole idea of art is to keep

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.550 
I think the whole idea of art is to keep
pushing<00:02:36.270> those<00:02:36.540> boundaries<00:02:36.959> and<00:02:37.230> breaking

pushing those boundaries and breaking

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.710 
pushing those boundaries and breaking

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.699 
something don't think like okay well
here's<00:02:41.220> what<00:02:41.430> we<00:02:41.459> do<00:02:41.760> we<00:02:42.750> just<00:02:42.900> write<00:02:43.170> what<00:02:43.560> we

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
here's what we do we just write what we

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.259 
here's what we do we just write what we
feel<00:02:44.010> like<00:02:44.280> needs<00:02:44.550> to<00:02:44.670> be<00:02:44.849> written<00:02:45.120> at<00:02:45.239> that

feel like needs to be written at that

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.110 
feel like needs to be written at that
moment<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.040> whatever<00:02:47.040> people<00:02:47.400> sort<00:02:47.879> of<00:02:47.910> want
