00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.200 

but<00:00:50.330> they<00:00:50.480> give<00:00:50.630> me<00:00:50.750> a<00:00:50.810> lot<00:00:50.930> health<00:00:52.000> if<00:00:53.000> I

but they give me a lot health if I

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.820 
but they give me a lot health if I
children<00:00:53.750> so<00:00:54.320> I<00:00:54.890> guess<00:00:55.730> that's<00:00:55.910> a<00:00:55.970> plus

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:56.830 
children so I guess that's a plus

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:03.880 
children so I guess that's a plus
balances<00:00:57.830> out<00:00:57.950> the<00:00:58.010> you<00:00:58.190> playin<00:01:02.890> every

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
balances out the you playin every

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:13.260 
balances out the you playin every
equation<00:01:04.129> needs<00:01:04.610> a<00:01:04.760> balance<00:01:06.850> ok

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270

easy for some apparent reason and you
translate<00:02:33.560> it<00:02:33.590> wrong<00:02:35.260> it's<00:02:36.550> sort<00:02:37.550> of<00:02:37.700> easy<00:02:38.000> if

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
translate it wrong it's sort of easy if

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.050 
translate it wrong it's sort of easy if
you<00:02:38.780> have<00:02:39.080> the<00:02:40.840> levels<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:42.370> way<00:02:43.370> and<00:02:43.700> if<00:02:43.940> you

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
you have the levels and way and if you

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.930 
you have the levels and way and if you
get<00:02:44.239> those<00:02:44.450> ten<00:02:45.440> things<00:02:45.830> like<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.400> defense<00:02:46.730> up

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
get those ten things like the defense up

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.160 
get those ten things like the defense up
and<00:02:47.150> strength<00:02:47.420> up<00:02:47.660> and<00:02:48.459> use<00:02:49.459> those<00:02:49.989> this<00:02:50.989> does

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
and strength up and use those this does

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.550 
and strength up and use those this does
really<00:02:51.470> helped<00:02:51.680> a<00:02:51.800> lot<00:02:52.060> because<00:02:53.440> they<00:02:54.440> are

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
really helped a lot because they are

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.410 
really helped a lot because they are
termed<00:02:54.980> in<00:02:55.220> which<00:02:55.459> i<00:02:55.610> didn't<00:02:55.850> know<00:02:58.330> because<00:02:59.330> i

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
termed in which i didn't know because i

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.670 
termed in which i didn't know because i
wasn't<00:02:59.600> using<00:02:59.989> them<00:03:00.080> because<00:03:00.200> i<00:03:00.380> didn't<00:03:00.620> know

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
wasn't using them because i didn't know

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.229 
wasn't using them because i didn't know
they<00:03:00.830> were<00:03:00.890> permanent<00:03:01.459> and<00:03:01.610> if<00:03:01.850> i<00:03:01.940> knew<00:03:02.090> that

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
the ultimate Keyblade but this is

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.020 
the ultimate Keyblade but this is
unnormal<00:03:13.890> so<00:03:14.129> there's<00:03:14.310> no<00:03:14.400> point<00:03:14.610> to<00:03:14.730> getting

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
unnormal so there's no point to getting

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.660 
unnormal so there's no point to getting
the<00:03:15.150> ultimate<00:03:15.569> ultimate<00:03:16.379> Keyblade<00:03:16.829> cuz<00:03:17.519> I

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
the ultimate ultimate Keyblade cuz I

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.059 
the ultimate ultimate Keyblade cuz I
gotta<00:03:17.879> fill<00:03:18.180> an<00:03:18.390> expert<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:19.049> I'm<00:03:19.620> gonna<00:03:19.829> get

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
gotta fill an expert and I'm gonna get

gotta fill an expert and I'm gonna get
the<00:03:20.189> ultimate<00:03:20.489> keyblade<00:03:21.180> and<00:03:21.829> then<00:03:22.829> that's

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
the ultimate keyblade and then that's

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.300 
the ultimate keyblade and then that's
going<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:23.340> be<00:03:23.459> awesome<00:03:24.290> so<00:03:25.290> yeah<00:03:25.680> I<00:03:25.920> think<00:03:25.980> this

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
going to be awesome so yeah I think this

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.569 
going to be awesome so yeah I think this
is<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:26.730> last<00:03:26.909> time<00:03:27.209> I<00:03:27.450> gotta<00:03:27.629> kill<00:03:27.870> him<00:03:27.989> I<00:03:28.579> can

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
is the last time I gotta kill him I can

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:50.070
