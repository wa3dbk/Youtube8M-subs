00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.560 
everything so I mean it could be the way
like<00:01:36.220> the<00:01:36.370> sidewalk<00:01:36.610> cracked<00:01:37.150> and<00:01:37.390> then<00:01:37.480> they

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
like the sidewalk cracked and then they

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.510 
like the sidewalk cracked and then they
painted<00:01:37.900> their<00:01:38.050> lines<00:01:38.260> on<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:38.680> highway<00:01:39.310> and

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.010 
painted their lines on the highway and
it<00:01:39.610> got<00:01:39.940> into<00:01:40.150> the<00:01:40.240> crack<00:01:40.450> and<00:01:40.480> trickle

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
it got into the crack and trickle

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.420 
it got into the crack and trickle
trickle<00:01:41.200> down<00:01:41.410> and<00:01:41.740> then<00:01:41.830> some<00:01:42.010> water<00:01:42.160> got

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
trickle down and then some water got

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.090 
trickle down and then some water got
into<00:01:42.610> it<00:01:42.850> and<00:01:42.970> created<00:01:43.300> a<00:01:43.390> different<00:01:43.570> effect

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
into it and created a different effect

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.830 
into it and created a different effect
or<00:01:45.100> it<00:01:45.340> could<00:01:45.490> be<00:01:45.670> could<00:01:46.210> be<00:01:46.330> going<00:01:46.570> to<00:01:46.690> the

really love that we're interacting with

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.560 
really love that we're interacting with
this<00:02:12.020> youth<00:02:12.530> you<00:02:12.980> know<00:02:13.040> because<00:02:13.490> it's<00:02:14.330> a<00:02:14.420> thing

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
this youth you know because it's a thing

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:15.670 
this youth you know because it's a thing
that<00:02:14.690> can<00:02:14.810> happen<00:02:14.900> as<00:02:15.170> you<00:02:15.230> get<00:02:15.350> older<00:02:15.530> is<00:02:15.590> you

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
that can happen as you get older is you

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.590 
that can happen as you get older is you
really<00:02:16.160> get<00:02:16.430> farther<00:02:16.730> and<00:02:16.850> farther<00:02:17.060> away<00:02:17.300> from

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
really get farther and farther away from

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.120 
really get farther and farther away from
the<00:02:17.900> next<00:02:18.110> generations<00:02:18.650> in<00:02:18.800> the<00:02:18.890> next

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
the next generations in the next

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.980 
the next generations in the next
generation<00:02:19.640> and<00:02:20.420> I<00:02:20.510> think<00:02:20.660> it's<00:02:20.750> really

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
generation and I think it's really

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.020 
generation and I think it's really
important<00:02:21.410> to<00:02:21.560> stay<00:02:21.770> in<00:02:21.950> touch<00:02:21.980> and<00:02:22.160> it's

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
important to stay in touch and it's

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.910 
important to stay in touch and it's
really<00:02:23.510> a<00:02:23.540> great<00:02:23.780> interface<00:02:24.110> with<00:02:24.560> a<00:02:24.770> young

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
really a great interface with a young

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.820 
really a great interface with a young
generation<00:02:25.520> I<00:02:25.940> think<00:02:26.810> if<00:02:27.110> yet<00:02:27.290> if<00:02:27.440> you<00:02:27.560> had<00:02:27.709> to

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
generation I think if yet if you had to

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.810 
generation I think if yet if you had to
say<00:02:28.010> what<00:02:28.340> my<00:02:28.790> art<00:02:29.030> is<00:02:29.209> about<00:02:29.630> in<00:02:30.380> one<00:02:31.100> word<00:02:31.310> it

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
say what my art is about in one word it

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.660 
say what my art is about in one word it
would<00:02:31.850> be<00:02:32.030> about<00:02:32.450> be<00:02:33.260> about<00:02:33.290> freedom<00:02:33.680> freedom

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
would be about be about freedom freedom

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.430 
would be about be about freedom freedom
just<00:02:35.060> like<00:02:35.090> horns<00:02:35.600> like<00:02:35.780> you<00:02:35.959> know<00:02:36.110> it<00:02:36.260> when

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
just like horns like you know it when

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.430 
just like horns like you know it when
you<00:02:36.530> sing<00:02:36.739> it<00:02:37.090> and<00:02:38.090> if<00:02:38.239> freedom<00:02:38.900> is<00:02:38.989> not<00:02:39.200> a

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
you sing it and if freedom is not a

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.489 
you sing it and if freedom is not a
destination<00:02:39.920> it's<00:02:40.160> gold
