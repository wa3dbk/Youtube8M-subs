00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.720
 I greet you on the channel itself girls 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:25.500
 Today I propose to make a crib 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.640
 for small pupae we need 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.410
 the toy which we will be making 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:35.470
 cot paper in the box 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:39.220
 cardboard pen ruler sewed 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.750
 glue brush and paint as well 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.060
 decorating paper 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.900
 we still need sandpaper 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:54.100
 take our baby 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:57.710
 put the middle of the page draw 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:01.250
 bottom of the crib bottom I paint such 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:08.450
 size so that the baby can sleep comfortably 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:11.750
 in this crib I want to make the bumpers off 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.720
 the crib sides will be about the size of 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.950
 up to babyâ€™s neck i'm doing my mark 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:22.580
 turned out 7 cells 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:25.240
 principle all cells i'm drawing the future 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.240
 bumpers 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.370
 now i will draw a gluing valve 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:45.780
 I count the number of cells that I 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:51.910
 it turned out to share this number by 2 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:55.800
 they got 6 cells and i'll draw 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:02:02.140
 valve on one side on the other 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:04.060
 3 sides and 4 sides I know how much 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.150
 cell I now I need here 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.620
 count the number of cells not tall 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:21.970
 it turns out 12 to 7 I will draw 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:25.930
 rectangle here knowing the dimensions of this 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:33.720
 rectangle i will draw backs for our 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:36.750
 cots on the other hand do exactly 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.750
 same 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:55.910
 and draw a pause the bed will be on the baby 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:59.270
 like little people when I cut, I add 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.910
 detail in half to cut it 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:10.660
 absolutely symmetrically cut part 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:13.910
 and I will fold along the fold lines and now 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:17.980
 redraw on cardboard besides i 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.980
 redraw all fold lines 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:38.409
 I cut the resulting part 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:42.329
 make cuts where the line valves are 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:44.099
 fold scratch with the help of sewed and 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:48.579
 rulers 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:56.930
 so that the part is exactly now 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:04:06.109
 glue the box I use clampers 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:08.030
 but the drying time of the part I now 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:10.400
 pasted our billet 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.349
 paper for scrapbooking instead of paper 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.329
 for scrapbooking you can use 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:17.329
 color paper now we need to do 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:22.780
 we will cut out backs for each back 5-6 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:24.970
 glue the parts together and peel them off 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.820
 paper 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.640
 we need two details well 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:34.080
 dry them under a heavy object 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:38.440
 when the parts are dry they will become hard 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:43.480
 now we need to make the edges even 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:49.360
 for this we shkurim throw you 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:55.080
 even excess paper here with them here 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:56.890
 we glue the cot together with this movement 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.700
 bed edge 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:04.090
 I painted the paint well, that's all 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:06.730
 the bed is ready you can put the baby 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.210
 all the good work to meet in 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.210
 next video 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.860
 chair
