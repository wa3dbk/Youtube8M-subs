at MotoGP 14 again on the jello because
that's<00:00:15.660> what<00:00:15.689> we're<00:00:15.869> used<00:00:16.049> in<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.289> first<00:00:16.500> part

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
that's what we're used in the first part

that's what we're used in the first part
we've<00:00:16.949> got<00:00:17.039> three<00:00:17.250> bikes<00:00:17.550> here<00:00:17.730> microgravity

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
we've got three bikes here microgravity

Cal Crutchlow and Marc Marquez now
before<00:00:22.169> you<00:00:22.410> watch<00:00:22.560> this<00:00:22.710> video<00:00:22.919> it<00:00:23.130> should<00:00:23.310> be

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
before you watch this video it should be

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.310 
before you watch this video it should be
pointed<00:00:23.699> out<00:00:23.999> that<00:00:24.150> that's<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.480> same<00:00:24.689> Marc

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
pointed out that that's the same Marc

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.499 
pointed out that that's the same Marc
Marquez<00:00:25.740> clip<00:00:25.980> we<00:00:26.249> saw<00:00:26.400> earlier<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:27.029> i<00:00:27.269> have

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:27.509 
Marquez clip we saw earlier and i have

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:29.810 
Marquez clip we saw earlier and i have
since<00:00:27.869> improved<00:00:28.230> my<00:00:28.499> lap<00:00:28.679> time<00:00:28.949> by<00:00:29.489> over<00:00:29.789> a

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
since improved my lap time by over a

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.030 
since improved my lap time by over a
seconds<00:00:30.390> that's<00:00:30.599> down<00:00:30.779> into<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.109> 148<00:00:31.739> now

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
seconds that's down into the 148 now

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.180 
seconds that's down into the 148 now
probably<00:00:32.279> 147<00:00:33.150> soon<00:00:33.620> but<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.650> get<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.890> bit<00:00:35.070> more

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
probably 147 soon but I get a bit more

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.550 
probably 147 soon but I get a bit more
leery<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.790> I'm<00:00:36.450> not<00:00:36.660> as<00:00:36.780> consistent<00:00:37.350> on<00:00:37.470> the

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:37.560 
leery and I'm not as consistent on the

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.960 
leery and I'm not as consistent on the
bike<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.070> one<00:00:38.370> thing<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.610> important

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:38.970 
bike and the one thing is important

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.670 
bike and the one thing is important
about<00:00:39.030> these<00:00:39.270> videos<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.720> consistency<00:00:40.410> so

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
about these videos is consistency so

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.020 
about these videos is consistency so
we've<00:00:40.830> used<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.130> older<00:00:41.400> video<00:00:41.610> which<00:00:41.880> is<00:00:41.970> a

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
we've used the older video which is a

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.360 
we've used the older video which is a
slightly<00:00:42.300> style<00:00:42.600> lap<00:00:42.780> time<00:00:43.020> but<00:00:43.740> it<00:00:43.860> does<00:00:44.130> give

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
slightly style lap time but it does give

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.830 
slightly style lap time but it does give
us<00:00:44.490> a<00:00:44.760> good<00:00:45.750> balance<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:47.240> compare<00:00:48.240> lap<00:00:48.540> times

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
us a good balance to compare lap times

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.670 
us a good balance to compare lap times
between<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.440> different<00:00:49.710> bikes<00:00:50.900> and<00:00:51.900> see<00:00:52.410> how

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
between the different bikes and see how

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.220 
between the different bikes and see how
they<00:00:52.890> perform<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.790> you<00:00:54.480> can<00:00:54.660> already<00:00:54.810> see

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
they perform and you can already see

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.580 
they perform and you can already see
michael<00:00:55.590> laverty<00:00:55.680> spike<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:57.230> some<00:00:58.230> way<00:00:58.410> off

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
michael laverty spike is some way off

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.350 
michael laverty spike is some way off
the<00:00:58.800> pace<00:00:59.010> it's<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.430> little<00:00:59.640> bit<00:00:59.760> more<00:00:59.910> sluggish

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
the pace it's a little bit more sluggish

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.180 
the pace it's a little bit more sluggish
it<00:01:00.750> doesn't<00:01:01.050> have<00:01:01.200> the<00:01:01.230> grip<00:01:01.620> going<00:01:01.980> into

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
it doesn't have the grip going into

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.450 
it doesn't have the grip going into
corners<00:01:03.079> you're<00:01:04.079> having<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.530> delay<00:01:05.009> a<00:01:05.040> bit<00:01:05.309> on

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
corners you're having to delay a bit on

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.830 
corners you're having to delay a bit on
the<00:01:05.549> throttle<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.299> can<00:01:06.450> see<00:01:06.630> they're

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
the throttle and you can see they're

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.510 
the throttle and you can see they're
just<00:01:06.869> went<00:01:07.229> wide<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.950> wasn't<00:01:08.189> going<00:01:08.340> where<00:01:08.460> I

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
just went wide it wasn't going where I

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.850 
just went wide it wasn't going where I
wanted<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:10.260> good<00:01:10.440> to<00:01:10.560> see<00:01:10.710> the

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
wanted it to so it's good to see the

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.560 
wanted it to so it's good to see the
balance<00:01:11.220> between<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.640> different<00:01:12.030> bikes<00:01:12.240> now

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
balance between the different bikes now

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.230 
balance between the different bikes now
of<00:01:12.690> course<00:01:12.870> you<00:01:13.350> can<00:01:13.470> see<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.710> settings<00:01:14.240> all

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240

want it obviously the Pikes in real life
you<00:01:25.800> use<00:01:25.950> full<00:01:26.190> traction<00:01:27.620> without<00:01:28.620> enough

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
you use full traction without enough

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.140 
you use full traction without enough
practice<00:01:29.220> on<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.460> I'd<00:01:29.550> have<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.790> say<00:01:29.909> full

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
practice on it I'd have to say full

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.460 
practice on it I'd have to say full
traction<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.630> probably<00:01:30.900> always<00:01:31.050> going<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.440> be

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
traction is probably always going to be

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.140 
traction is probably always going to be
quicker<00:01:31.830> you're<00:01:32.340> just<00:01:32.490> going<00:01:32.760> to<00:01:32.820> be<00:01:32.940> able<00:01:33.000> to

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
quicker you're just going to be able to

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.240 
quicker you're just going to be able to
get<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.300> power<00:01:33.540> down<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.780> lot<00:01:34.020> easier<00:01:34.250> but

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
get the power down a lot easier but

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.130 
get the power down a lot easier but
having<00:01:35.700> said<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.330> more<00:01:36.510> fun<00:01:36.810> with<00:01:37.110> a

having said that it is more fun with a
little<00:01:37.290> bit<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.590> rear<00:01:38.400> wheel<00:01:38.640> spin<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.270> with

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
little bit of rear wheel spin and with

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.110 
little bit of rear wheel spin and with
the<00:01:39.900> medium<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.799> get<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.010> nice<00:01:41.250> balance<00:01:41.880> of

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
the medium you get that nice balance of

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.300 
the medium you get that nice balance of
being<00:01:42.420> able<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.720> spin<00:01:42.990> up<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.229> rear<00:01:43.380> wheel<00:01:43.590> yet

not<00:01:44.580> completely<00:01:45.150> destroy<00:01:45.510> your<00:01:45.690> lap<00:01:45.810> time<00:01:46.080> you

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
not completely destroy your lap time you

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.760 
not completely destroy your lap time you
do<00:01:46.979> have<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.430> be<00:01:47.610> mindful<00:01:48.120> and<00:01:48.630> focused<00:01:49.440> on<00:01:49.650> it

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
do have to be mindful and focused on it

into the 148 s now I can probably do 147
maybe<00:03:49.420> 146<00:03:50.230> but<00:03:50.740> I<00:03:50.770> don't<00:03:51.040> think<00:03:51.130> I'll<00:03:51.280> be

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
maybe 146 but I don't think I'll be

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.370 
maybe 146 but I don't think I'll be
faster<00:03:51.730> than<00:03:51.760> that<00:03:51.910> but<00:03:52.360> I<00:03:52.420> do<00:03:52.660> believe<00:03:52.960> that

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
faster than that but I do believe that

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.560 
faster than that but I do believe that
if<00:03:53.950> you're<00:03:54.250> on<00:03:54.490> the<00:03:54.550> limit<00:03:55.030> and<00:03:55.120> you<00:03:55.240> know<00:03:55.390> how

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
if you're on the limit and you know how

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.200 
if you're on the limit and you know how
to<00:03:55.860> throw<00:03:56.860> the<00:03:57.070> bike<00:03:57.220> into<00:03:57.460> each<00:03:57.670> corner<00:03:57.970> you

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:58.210 
to throw the bike into each corner you

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.930 
to throw the bike into each corner you
can<00:03:58.330> go<00:03:58.510> quicker<00:03:58.960> than<00:03:59.170> that<00:03:59.410> so<00:03:59.710> the<00:04:00.670> time<00:04:00.910> is

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
can go quicker than that so the time is

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.060 
can go quicker than that so the time is
a<00:04:01.870> little<00:04:02.110> bits<00:04:02.260> of<00:04:02.350> time<00:04:02.590> that<00:04:02.770> I've<00:04:02.890> found

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
a little bits of time that I've found

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.830 
a little bits of time that I've found
it's<00:04:03.370> getting<00:04:03.790> on<00:04:03.880> the<00:04:03.970> power<00:04:04.180> early<00:04:04.570> out<00:04:04.690> of<00:04:04.780> a

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
it's getting on the power early out of a

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.270 
it's getting on the power early out of a
corner<00:04:05.260> and<00:04:05.320> you're<00:04:05.500> making<00:04:05.650> time<00:04:05.980> all<00:04:06.190> the

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
corner and you're making time all the

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.770 
corner and you're making time all the
way<00:04:06.370> down<00:04:06.580> the<00:04:06.700> straight<00:04:07.030> and<00:04:07.330> it's<00:04:07.510> really

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
way down the straight and it's really

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.380 
way down the straight and it's really
just<00:04:07.990> finding<00:04:08.410> out<00:04:08.470> how<00:04:08.650> to<00:04:08.710> keep<00:04:09.550> a<00:04:09.760> pic<00:04:10.030> speed

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
just finding out how to keep a pic speed

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.540 
just finding out how to keep a pic speed
and<00:04:10.690> then<00:04:11.260> get<00:04:11.500> on<00:04:11.530> the<00:04:11.710> power<00:04:11.920> get<00:04:12.280> traction

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
and then get on the power get traction

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.500 
and then get on the power get traction
on<00:04:13.000> those<00:04:13.540> corners<00:04:14.430> as<00:04:15.430> well<00:04:15.850> so<00:04:16.239> be

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
on those corners as well so be

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.479 
on those corners as well so be
interesting<00:04:17.049> to<00:04:17.200> see<00:04:17.470> the<00:04:17.739> balance<00:04:18.310> in<00:04:18.459> terms

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
interesting to see the balance in terms

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.090 
interesting to see the balance in terms
of<00:04:18.790> lap<00:04:18.970> times<00:04:19.299> and<00:04:19.660> ultimately<00:04:20.560> despite<00:04:21.010> the

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
of lap times and ultimately despite the

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.480 
of lap times and ultimately despite the
tests<00:04:21.400> I've<00:04:21.519> done<00:04:21.790> on<00:04:22.030> these<00:04:22.480> videos<00:04:23.310> how<00:04:24.310> it

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
tests I've done on these videos how it

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.730 
tests I've done on these videos how it
turns<00:04:24.760> out<00:04:24.940> in<00:04:25.000> terms<00:04:25.270> of<00:04:25.480> online<00:04:25.990> as<00:04:26.260> well<00:04:26.440> in

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
turns out in terms of online as well in

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.080 
turns out in terms of online as well in
terms<00:04:26.770> of<00:04:27.130> stability<00:04:27.700> and<00:04:28.450> performance<00:04:30.090> I'm

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
terms of stability and performance I'm

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.120 
terms of stability and performance I'm
missing<00:04:31.480> some<00:04:31.690> of<00:04:31.720> my<00:04:31.960> tuck<00:04:32.170> ins<00:04:32.410> there<00:04:32.740> on<00:04:33.010> I

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
missing some of my tuck ins there on I

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.190 
missing some of my tuck ins there on I
with<00:04:33.370> cow<00:04:33.610> that's<00:04:34.510> what<00:04:34.690> I<00:04:34.720> mean<00:04:34.960> there's

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
with cow that's what I mean there's

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.380 
with cow that's what I mean there's
little<00:04:35.410> things<00:04:35.590> like<00:04:35.770> that<00:04:36.010> tuck<00:04:36.370> in<00:04:36.580> more<00:04:36.850> you

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 
little things like that tuck in more you

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:38.909 
little things like that tuck in more you
can't<00:04:37.630> actually<00:04:37.840> tuck<00:04:38.410> in<00:04:38.620> when<00:04:38.830> you're

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
can't actually tuck in when you're

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:40.860 
can't actually tuck in when you're
leaning<00:04:39.460> and<00:04:39.640> you'll<00:04:39.970> you'll<00:04:40.300> actually<00:04:40.540> lean

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
leaning and you'll you'll actually lean

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.630 
leaning and you'll you'll actually lean
a<00:04:40.900> bit<00:04:41.050> further<00:04:41.380> and<00:04:41.740> put<00:04:41.950> your<00:04:42.070> elbow<00:04:42.430> on<00:04:42.610> the

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
a bit further and put your elbow on the

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.770 
a bit further and put your elbow on the
ground<00:04:42.760> so<00:04:43.500> it's<00:04:44.500> a<00:04:44.820> bit<00:04:45.820> unbalanced<00:04:46.480> is<00:04:46.630> the

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
ground so it's a bit unbalanced is the

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.630 
ground so it's a bit unbalanced is the
bike<00:04:46.990> when<00:04:47.230> you<00:04:47.350> step<00:04:47.590> up<00:04:47.620> again<00:04:48.010> so<00:04:48.340> there's

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.640 
bike when you step up again so there's

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.220 
bike when you step up again so there's
lots<00:04:48.730> and<00:04:49.000> lots<00:04:49.120> to<00:04:49.240> learn<00:04:49.390> I<00:04:49.450> mean<00:04:49.810> doing<00:04:50.020> lots

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
lots and lots to learn I mean doing lots

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.440 
lots and lots to learn I mean doing lots
of<00:04:50.380> thats<00:04:50.590> those<00:04:50.980> of<00:04:51.190> you<00:04:51.280> that<00:04:51.400> love<00:04:51.460> MotoGP

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
will no doubt get into it and find lots

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:56.850 
will no doubt get into it and find lots
of<00:04:55.570> additional<00:04:55.750> lap<00:04:56.140> time<00:04:56.380> but<00:04:56.560> I<00:04:56.590> hope<00:04:56.710> you've

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
of additional lap time but I hope you've

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.440 
of additional lap time but I hope you've
enjoyed<00:04:56.919> this<00:04:57.280> little<00:04:57.430> comparison<00:04:57.880> something

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
enjoyed this little comparison something

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.120 
enjoyed this little comparison something
different<00:04:58.900> just<00:04:59.440> to<00:04:59.530> show<00:04:59.680> the<00:04:59.830> different

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
different just to show the different

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.180 
different just to show the different
bikes<00:05:00.370> in<00:05:00.669> terms<00:05:00.880> of<00:05:01.030> performance<00:05:01.380> and<00:05:02.380> we

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
bikes in terms of performance and we

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.920 
bikes in terms of performance and we
will<00:05:03.430> come<00:05:03.700> back<00:05:03.820> to<00:05:03.880> this<00:05:04.120> at<00:05:05.050> a<00:05:05.110> later<00:05:05.290> stage

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
will come back to this at a later stage

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.780 
will come back to this at a later stage
but<00:05:07.930> you<00:05:08.020> can<00:05:08.169> see<00:05:08.350> generally<00:05:08.800> my<00:05:08.980> my<00:05:09.520> just<00:05:09.550> my

but you can see generally my my just my
general<00:05:10.030> riding<00:05:10.600> is<00:05:10.720> improved<00:05:11.110> with<00:05:11.350> cows

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
general riding is improved with cows

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.590 
general riding is improved with cows
bike<00:05:12.280> compared<00:05:12.669> to<00:05:12.760> the<00:05:12.850> markers<00:05:13.210> one<00:05:13.419> a

bike compared to the markers one a

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.420 
bike compared to the markers one a
little<00:05:14.410> bit<00:05:14.500> more<00:05:14.620> body<00:05:14.770> language<00:05:15.220> in<00:05:15.340> the

little bit more body language in the
