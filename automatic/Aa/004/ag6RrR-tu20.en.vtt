ears<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.820> little<00:00:59.879> bit<00:01:00.239> but<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:00.809> one<00:01:01.109> aspect

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
ears a little bit but this is one aspect

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.070 
ears a little bit but this is one aspect
of<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.859> Strikemaster<00:01:02.129> promotion<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.690> we<00:01:03.870> do

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
of the Strikemaster promotion that we do

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.039 
of the Strikemaster promotion that we do
it<00:01:04.409> does<00:01:04.680> draw<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.010> crowd<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.869> we've<00:01:06.869> never

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
it does draw a crowd and we've never

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.530 
it does draw a crowd and we've never
been<00:01:07.229> beaten<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.830> think<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.909> record<00:01:09.119> was

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
been beaten I think the record was

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.120 
been beaten I think the record was
through<00:01:09.960> what<00:01:10.590> was<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.979> 60<00:01:11.970> inches<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.390> ice<00:01:12.540> in

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
through what was it 60 inches of ice in

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.820 
through what was it 60 inches of ice in
7.3<00:01:14.130> seconds<00:01:14.610> that's<00:01:15.000> three<00:01:15.240> holes<00:01:15.479> at<00:01:16.380> Pequot

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
7.3 seconds that's three holes at Pequot

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.550 
7.3 seconds that's three holes at Pequot

in<00:01:44.700> holding<00:01:45.180> on<00:01:45.299> with<00:01:45.390> one<00:01:45.479> hand<00:01:45.770> he<00:01:46.770> pulls<00:01:47.189> it

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
in holding on with one hand he pulls it

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.999 
in holding on with one hand he pulls it
and<00:01:48.149> when<00:01:48.390> he<00:01:48.509> pulls<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:49.020> by<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.470> time<00:01:49.710> he<00:01:49.860> gets

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
and when he pulls it by the time he gets

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.800 
and when he pulls it by the time he gets
his<00:01:50.220> other<00:01:50.399> hand<00:01:50.700> he's<00:01:50.939> down<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.360> ice<00:01:51.479> about

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
his other hand he's down the ice about

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.520 
his other hand he's down the ice about
six<00:01:52.140> inches<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:52.530> watch<00:01:53.310> how<00:01:53.549> he<00:01:53.610> handles<00:01:54.119> this

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
six inches so watch how he handles this

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.109 
six inches so watch how he handles this
he<00:01:55.530> does<00:01:55.740> have<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:55.979> kill<00:01:56.280> switch<00:01:56.310> on<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:56.939> so<00:01:57.060> if

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
he does have a kill switch on it so if

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.580 
he does have a kill switch on it so if
it<00:01:57.240> gets<00:01:57.390> away<00:01:57.509> probably<00:01:58.020> won't<00:01:58.229> go<00:01:58.350> into<00:01:58.469> the

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
it gets away probably won't go into the

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.260
