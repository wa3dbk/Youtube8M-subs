00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
I was totally excited and so I'm going

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.660 
I was totally excited and so I'm going
to<00:01:50.090> get<00:01:50.240> fitted<00:01:50.540> for<00:01:50.690> 12<00:01:51.380> so<00:01:51.920> that<00:01:51.950> I<00:01:52.190> could<00:01:52.370> do

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
to get fitted for 12 so that I could do

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.030 
to get fitted for 12 so that I could do
it<00:01:52.790> but<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.150> Nano<00:01:53.360> i<00:01:53.630> have<00:01:53.960> is<00:01:54.440> working<00:01:54.890> really

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
it but the Nano i have is working really

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.700 
it but the Nano i have is working really
well<00:01:55.220> i<00:01:55.550> actually<00:01:56.200> qualified<00:01:57.200> for<00:01:57.560> the

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
well i actually qualified for the

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.820 
well i actually qualified for the
southpoint<00:01:58.550> invitational<00:01:59.270> and<00:01:59.480> I<00:01:59.930> plate<00:02:00.260> so

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
southpoint invitational and I plate so

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.970

I'm<00:02:01.220> really<00:02:01.940> happy<00:02:02.240> with<00:02:02.420> it<00:02:02.570> I<00:02:02.990> think<00:02:03.710> because

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980 
I'm really happy with it I think because

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.810 
I'm really happy with it I think because
if<00:02:04.130> rolls<00:02:04.430> off<00:02:04.700> really<00:02:05.420> well<00:02:05.540> and<00:02:06.140> it<00:02:06.440> goes<00:02:06.820> you

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
if rolls off really well and it goes you

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.750 
if rolls off really well and it goes you
know<00:02:08.020> long<00:02:09.020> and<00:02:09.470> then<00:02:09.680> it<00:02:09.800> just<00:02:09.830> snaps<00:02:10.430> into

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
know long and then it just snaps into

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.450 
know long and then it just snaps into
the<00:02:11.030> pocket

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
the pocket

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.620
