00:00:00.769 --> 00:00:04.610
 olave â€‹â€‹individual children and juan alberto if this is my car 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.759
 it is a chevrolet camaro 1987 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:12.199
 engine 8 cylinders in v 5 thousand cubic centimeters 

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:15.980
 if you have enough bad things like for example the nose of this squad 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.090
 but if it ends up breaking because it touches everything else 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:24.560
 the doors do not fit either fixed in the space there for example between 

00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:26.289
 the letter and the force 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.289
 carmen nordelo perfectly 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.170
 another thing that you have is that the front windshield is also 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.679
 riven 

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:37.850
 I do not know if he just left 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.700
 of the interior I could not count many things 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.090
 as an example 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.090
 on the radio was the day by its absence 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.270
 for example also the dashboard is cracked 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.840
 the speakers as you can check do not exist either 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.450
 the coupling of the backrest must be broken by the character of a braking 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.880
 yes all in all for the woman 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.360
 the belt on the back seats as you can see are also 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.260
 people in need 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.360
 the backrest of the back seats is completely resolved 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.450
 your opponent 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.530
 the flashing lever and not clean also broke 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.980
 if you think that putting some switches apart 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.980
 nothing can demand 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.590
 the passenger's belt if it's not bad 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.500
 today it is completely true 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.640
 and pick up back 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.640
 here you can also see how it is upholstered 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.870
 some interior plastics 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.870
 the subsidiary go down but they get stuck they went pretty 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.080
 and when I came over 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.080
 after a few leaks on one side 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.370
 I hope that my shrimp has been quite sorry so please in tibi 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.310
