00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
probably too light for me the kind of

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.560 
probably too light for me the kind of
consistency<00:00:43.500> sort<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.309> reminds<00:00:44.789> me<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:45.000> the

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
consistency sort of reminds me of the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.869 
consistency sort of reminds me of the
Revlon<00:00:46.230> whipped<00:00:46.710> foundation<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.460> didn't<00:00:47.760> get

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
ready with me video using that

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.170 
ready with me video using that
foundations<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.129> clearly<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.460> like<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:50.969> one

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
foundations of clearly I like that one

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.490 
foundations of clearly I like that one
it<00:00:51.420> kind<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.629> reminds<00:00:51.899> me<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.230> it's

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
it kind of reminds me of that it's

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.619 
it kind of reminds me of that it's
obviously<00:00:52.860> much<00:00:53.100> smaller<00:00:53.579> more<00:00:54.059> convenient

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
obviously much smaller more convenient

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.689 
obviously much smaller more convenient
packaging<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.500> hopefully<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.129> will<00:00:56.190> hold<00:00:56.460> up

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
packaging and hopefully it will hold up

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.250 
packaging and hopefully it will hold up
a<00:00:56.879> lot<00:00:57.030> better<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.480> packaging<00:00:57.930> kind<00:00:58.199> of

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
a lot better that packaging kind of

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.650 
a lot better that packaging kind of
sucks<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:59.640> this<00:00:59.789> is<00:00:59.910> better<00:01:00.090> but<00:01:00.270> it's<00:01:00.390> also<00:01:00.510> a

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
sucks so this is better but it's also a

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.869 
sucks so this is better but it's also a
less<00:01:01.230> product<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.859> believe<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.370> don't<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.609> looks

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
less product I believe I don't it looks

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.369 
less product I believe I don't it looks
like<00:01:03.120> less<00:01:03.390> product<00:01:03.809> I'm<00:01:03.960> gonna<00:01:04.140> apply<00:01:04.260> this

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
little bit of self tanning so maybe if I

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.440 
little bit of self tanning so maybe if I
wasn't<00:01:46.170> doing<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:47.399> wouldn't<00:01:47.909> be<00:01:48.119> so

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
wasn't doing that it wouldn't be so

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.870

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
idea of what the coverage is like it's

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.460 
idea of what the coverage is like it's
easy<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.220> spread<00:01:53.460> on<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.820> everything<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:54.930> here

there's a little bit of stuff but you
know<00:02:15.400> I<00:02:15.730> don't<00:02:16.329> think<00:02:16.510> it's<00:02:16.720> like<00:02:16.840> a<00:02:16.870> full

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950

I've<00:02:36.549> got<00:02:36.760> all<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.450> everything<00:02:37.840> on<00:02:38.230> I<00:02:38.260> tried

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
I've got all the everything on I tried

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.949 
I've got all the everything on I tried
to<00:02:38.769> warm<00:02:39.010> it<00:02:39.129> up<00:02:39.250> a<00:02:39.430> lot<00:02:39.579> with<00:02:39.790> bronzer<00:02:40.329> as<00:02:40.659> I

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
to warm it up a lot with bronzer as I

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.539 
to warm it up a lot with bronzer as I
usually<00:02:41.500> do<00:02:41.650> and<00:02:41.799> I<00:02:41.889> think<00:02:41.950> it<00:02:42.129> looks<00:02:42.280> a<00:02:42.400> lot

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
usually do and I think it looks a lot

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.849 
usually do and I think it looks a lot
better<00:02:42.609> especially<00:02:43.299> with<00:02:43.930> blush<00:02:44.260> and<00:02:44.620> lips

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:44.859 
better especially with blush and lips

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:46.770 
better especially with blush and lips
and<00:02:45.190> everything<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:46.090> foundation<00:02:46.629> is

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
and everything the foundation is

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.379 
and everything the foundation is
essentially<00:02:47.530> too<00:02:47.889> pale<00:02:48.129> for<00:02:48.430> me<00:02:48.549> and<00:02:48.790> you<00:02:49.359> know

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:49.389 
essentially too pale for me and you know

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:51.930 
essentially too pale for me and you know
obviously<00:02:50.049> I<00:02:50.170> could<00:02:50.409> fix<00:02:50.620> that<00:02:50.889> by<00:02:51.310> reading

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
obviously I could fix that by reading

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.449 
obviously I could fix that by reading
the<00:02:52.060> label<00:02:52.359> on<00:02:52.420> the<00:02:52.480> back<00:02:52.720> but<00:02:53.319> I<00:02:53.650> didn't<00:02:54.010> so

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
didn't realize how heavy the coverage

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:41.610 
didn't realize how heavy the coverage
was<00:03:40.419> whenever<00:03:40.810> I<00:03:40.870> was<00:03:40.989> just<00:03:41.169> putting<00:03:41.379> it<00:03:41.560> on

inside but the moment I walked out which

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.619 
inside but the moment I walked out which
I<00:03:44.109> left<00:03:44.500> like<00:03:44.829> almost<00:03:45.280> immediately<00:03:45.819> after<00:03:46.359> I

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:46.629

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.909 
filmed the first part of the video and I
was<00:03:48.909> like<00:03:49.030> looking<00:03:49.389> at<00:03:49.510> my<00:03:49.569> skin<00:03:50.199> in<00:03:50.500> the<00:03:50.530> Sun

differently on your skin but in my

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.749 
differently on your skin but in my
opinion<00:05:19.180> it<00:05:19.810> wasn't<00:05:20.169> good<00:05:20.500> it<00:05:20.889> ain't<00:05:21.250> working

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 
opinion it wasn't good it ain't working

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:25.200 
opinion it wasn't good it ain't working
here's<00:05:22.599> kind<00:05:22.840> of<00:05:22.900> a<00:05:22.990> close-up<00:05:24.060> probably<00:05:25.060> not

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.580 

honestly<00:05:28.880> if<00:05:29.120> I<00:05:29.210> just<00:05:29.390> use<00:05:29.570> a<00:05:29.600> shine<00:05:29.930> sheet<00:05:30.350> and

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
honestly if I just use a shine sheet and

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.410 
honestly if I just use a shine sheet and
touched<00:05:31.160> up<00:05:31.340> with<00:05:31.400> some<00:05:31.670> powder<00:05:31.910> it<00:05:32.240> would

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:32.420 
touched up with some powder it would

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.330 
touched up with some powder it would

probably be totally okay biggest

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.370 
probably be totally okay biggest
