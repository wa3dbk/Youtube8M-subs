00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.890
 concept 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.000
 It's worth remembering that I have not read any 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:27.779
 these releases but I have that 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.760

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.399
 I'll be able to put my readings one 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.260

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.270
 I already did this with all the directors 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.370
 that I'm a partner 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.370
 at least so you end the partnership 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.620
 imagining I read all the books and the 60 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.719
 The books, I'm in a day with her. 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.250
 December was the month he practically 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.920
 one book a day 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.960

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.600
 able to read books and more books during 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.059
 hours and hours 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.670
 well the first one that caught the eye was 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.189
 the city the secrets the cities secrets 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.080
 besides having a beautiful cover account 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.360
 the story of a teenage girl who 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.090
 lost his mother and stopped at a time 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.860
 she suffers in silence but she does not see herself 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.259
 future in that place 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.630
 behold, she suddenly receives the news 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.330
 What does your father want from you? 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.880
 she gets all excited and when it does not arrive 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.130
 At home she discovers that she is in the 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.270
 the middle of a wake and this wake of his 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.369
 big brother 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.799
 if that was not enough, your father would still 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:41.250
 asks her to get married and lose does not oblige 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:44.159
 let her marry as her sister's fiance 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.520
 older is completely confused 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.920
 When I just want you to be

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.369

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.430
 so they promise that they will find

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:07.950
 to marry an unknown man 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:10.200
 high expectations for this book 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.560
 another book that not only called me to 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.599
 attention for the cover also by the synopsis 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.780
 when I was young when the story of 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.280
 a teenager who at age 14 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.260

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.849
 include in the program to protect 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.160
 witnesses and is included in the 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.050
 Witness Protection Program 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.830
 ends up assuming a new identity as 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.300
 joy 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.360
 the boy who is completely different 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.700
 What he was the joy ends up conquering 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.800
 the hearts of all the boys stayed 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.300
 super popular and becoming a runner 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.790
 very famous 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.940
 only that john and need background animatu was 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.830

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.739
 and death threats 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.450
 that's why I stayed very very 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.450
 interested in this book without counting 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.480
 that his debut book and I 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.540
 I read a couple of three reviews about him and 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.150
 it seems to be very very good 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.519
 It's a book I'm really looking forward to. 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.769
 read I intend to auctioned in January 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:17.640
 if possible, the tip is for those who are looking for 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:20.730
 the level with much suspense and action already 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:24.989
 society of the twin boys is a book 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:28.200
 I do not know, I was very curious. 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.780
 so why because mp account 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.540

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.489

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.010
 conquer your place one of the most 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:41.250
 prestigious universities as they 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:44.700
 which is executive for cats 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.680
 so she has to do few good ones 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.200
 to maintain your identity 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.340
 within a university that only with the 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.930
 swine 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.120
 The most interesting is that the plot 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.730
 inspired by two classic night 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.790
 kings and the importance of being honest is a 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:02.609
 book that the sun mainly mine 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.350
 curiosity and I'm sure I will 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:05.880
 I had a lot of fun with the plot because 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.060
 second here 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.340
 The Synopsis The Book Offers Fun 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.049
 adventure a humorous reflection on 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.480
 the gender issue 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:17.820
 so it's worth it are very very 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.549
 eager to give society the 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:25.140
 twin boys and finally goodbye to 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:27.130
 innocence for you I remember that I 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.560
 I do not know if it was me 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.380
 had to request the books as 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.540
 happens every month I do not 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.430
 I would ask God for innocence 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.550
 the dance you appear a book 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:44.040
 interesting but I do not know what I am 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:45.880
 how much is too much drama and 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.230
 to disappoint 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.090
 The book tells the story of a 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:52.330
 teenager who ran away with another 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.880
 teen willis and they come to live 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:58.810
 in california for five years 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:01.540
 only that she suddenly realizes that 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:04.450
 The boy she ran away with might not 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:07.600
 is that it appears to be because because 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.640
 ends up being another girl who has a 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.480
 appearance similar to hers of some 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.340
 years ago 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:16.390
 the book cover is not that pants 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:20.110
 impact is a simple but with 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:21.970
 a good one from the recording I do not know I do not 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.230
 I have no expectations for this 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.770
 book this book i remember a lot 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:29.260
 identity stolen by the 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.330
 style of the story and then I do not have 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.100
 no expectation for god innocence 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.860
 It is one of the books that I have not 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:39.190
 expectation that I hope not 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.230
 disappoint for four years and before 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.510
 forget I still have the book the world 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.430
 by the eyes of bob that left the world 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.400
 with the last blow eyes because 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:51.460
 It was the book I read the world through 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:54.310
 bob eyes still reporting the 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.890
 daily battles of twins and bob to 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:59.050
 survive in a world where there are people 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:01.510
 in ours but there are also people who only 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.950
 want to create problems for those who already have 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.890
 many problems 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:08.140
 differently from the first book and 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:11.260
 it gets closer the reader I felt 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.190
 as if the author as if he were already 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.220
 my side 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:17.980
 describing all his experiences as 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:20.590
 was his battle against drugs is a 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:24.130
 very very beautiful book the book that 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:26.380
 Thrills is a book that touches you like this. 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:28.360
 and that book is not that story 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.310
 fiction you're not even talking about here 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.000
 interesting but this does not happen in 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.610
 real life 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.840
 and that this is not the book he brings 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:40.470
 This strong reality bare raw but he 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.880
 also shows how his life 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.770
 has been changing slowly 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.270
 especially when the 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:48.180
 opportunity to launch its first 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:50.250
 book of this book he tells all 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.900
 the experiences of launching your 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.600
 first book since the process of 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:57.030
 creation of history until its first 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.770
 within a bookstore and how to 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:01.680
 he is thrilled to see thousands of 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:03.450
 people queuing for release 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.220
 of his book he did not really expect 

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:07.350
 and more interesting is that even after 

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:10.290
 all the success of the book the author 

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:12.420
 remain humble very humble then it is 

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:14.970
 a read more than recommended 

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:16.530
 everyone should read this book without 

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:18.960
 exception if you have not read the first book 

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:21.090
 read and then the world through the eyes of 

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:23.810
 impossible to press with a 

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:26.850
 So simple story so beautiful and so 

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:29.700
 charismatic a story that makes 

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:32.280
 you reflect on many many things 

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:34.590
 Well, this was the video with your 

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.120
 January of the new concept publisher I hope 

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:37.290
 Did you like this new one? 

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.150
 Format 

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:40.830
 leave in comments if you prefer 

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:43.040
 old fashion or if you prefer that 

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:46.380
 really talks a little about each book 

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:49.830
 I also have several projects 

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:51.120
 for January hugo finally I thought 

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:53.730
 that I'll be able to leave the channel 

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:58.020
 blog in day will not be so updated 

00:07:53.730 --> 00:08:00.600
 as he was last year one of the 

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:02.760
 The only releases of the publisher were 

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:04.979
 I wish I had received the same was nights 

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:07.020
 Italian seems to be very 

00:08:04.979 --> 00:08:11.550
 interesting as the synopsis somewhat 

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:13.740
 how peculiar and then I hope you 

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:15.830
 liked the video until the next 

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.830
 The
