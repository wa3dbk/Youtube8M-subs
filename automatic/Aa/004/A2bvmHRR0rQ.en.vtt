00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.800
I was born in the Badlands

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.670
in the days following the Cataclysm

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.510
a Black Dragon by blood.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.140
Perhaps the last of my kind.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.460
My egg was stolen from my mother

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.180
by the Red Dragonflight.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.300
Once they had what they needed,

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.790
my mother was murdered.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.910
They experimented on my egg.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.760
They tried to sever my connection

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.500
with the other black dragons,

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.290
so that I would be pure.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.010
They were more successful than they had bargained for.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.800
When my father found out about this travesty

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.080
he was … displeased.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.920
Perhaps you have heard of my father?

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.410
His name is Deathwing.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.450
My story would’ve ended there,

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.210
with the death of the Red Dragon who created me.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.600
But she was tricky, that one. 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.830
She was burned alive with a decoy in her hands. 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.330
MY egg was spirited away to the Red Dragonflight.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.820
There I was held captive…

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.890
for a time.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.450
This is Ravenholdt Manor. 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.450
Shortly before I was born,

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.670
the assassins of Ravenholdt 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.300
stole my egg from the Red Dragonflight, 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.250
the story of my deliverance 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.930
hinges on a most unusual Rogue.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.030
Suffice it to say he was a thief of global renown.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.970
This individual came to my attention

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.050
when the Red Dragonflight sent him

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.470
to infiltrate Ravenholdt Manor

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.720
and retrieve my egg.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.670
No doubt our hero expected to snatch up an egg

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.880
and steal away into the night.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.010
But instead he found something unexpected…

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.420
me.
