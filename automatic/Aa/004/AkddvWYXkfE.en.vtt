thing about using a food processor is

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.810 
thing about using a food processor is
you<00:03:43.350> don't<00:03:43.590> have<00:03:43.890> to<00:03:44.070> mince<00:03:44.250> them<00:03:44.400> up<00:03:44.549> so<00:03:44.730> we've

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
you don't have to mince them up so we've

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.900 
you don't have to mince them up so we've
got<00:03:45.030> that<00:03:45.060> and<00:03:45.769> we<00:03:46.769> have<00:03:47.010> some<00:03:47.310> fresh<00:03:47.610> lemon

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
got that and we have some fresh lemon

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.400 
got that and we have some fresh lemon
juice<00:03:48.090> so<00:03:48.390> we're<00:03:48.510> going<00:03:48.600> to<00:03:48.690> add<00:03:48.810> in<00:03:48.840> there<00:03:49.170> too

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
juice so we're going to add in there too

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.920 
juice so we're going to add in there too
I<00:03:49.850> think<00:03:50.850> that's<00:03:51.030> all<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.330> ingredients<00:03:51.420> step

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
I think that's all the ingredients step

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.120 
I think that's all the ingredients step
oh<00:03:52.049> and<00:03:52.290> you<00:03:52.440> know<00:03:52.470> what<00:03:52.560> else<00:03:52.680> I'd<00:03:52.890> like<00:03:53.010> to

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
oh and you know what else I'd like to

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.810 
oh and you know what else I'd like to
add<00:03:53.250> is<00:03:53.280> a<00:03:53.610> little<00:03:53.940> bit<00:03:54.060> of<00:03:54.090> salt<00:03:54.360> to<00:03:54.660> it<00:03:54.720> to

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
add is a little bit of salt to it to

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.230 
add is a little bit of salt to it to
pinch<00:03:56.820> of<00:03:57.030> salt

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.240 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:17.569 

pulse<00:04:00.230> it<00:04:00.410> around

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.759 

so<00:04:18.579> what<00:04:18.790> you<00:04:18.970> can<00:04:19.120> do<00:04:19.389> is<00:04:19.780> you<00:04:20.260> don't<00:04:20.380> have<00:04:20.500> to

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
so what you can do is you don't have to

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.170 
so what you can do is you don't have to
post<00:04:21.010> it<00:04:21.190> all<00:04:21.280> the<00:04:21.400> way<00:04:21.489> you<00:04:21.549> can<00:04:21.730> pulse<00:04:22.000> it

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
post it all the way you can pulse it

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.270 
post it all the way you can pulse it
until<00:04:22.240> it's<00:04:22.540> really<00:04:22.930> smooth<00:04:23.620> if<00:04:23.830> you<00:04:23.919> want<00:04:24.130> to

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
until it's really smooth if you want to

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.190 
until it's really smooth if you want to
or<00:04:24.490> you<00:04:24.520> can<00:04:24.850> leave<00:04:25.000> it<00:04:25.060> a<00:04:25.150> little<00:04:25.270> chunky<00:04:25.750> so

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
or you can leave it a little chunky so
