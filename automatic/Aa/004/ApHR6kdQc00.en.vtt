00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
drizzle that juice right on top of the

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.850 
drizzle that juice right on top of the
bird<00:02:46.670> when<00:02:47.660> you<00:02:47.750> put<00:02:48.019> the<00:02:48.170> bird<00:02:48.380> on<00:02:48.799> the

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
bird when you put the bird on the

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.979 
bird when you put the bird on the
barbecue<00:02:49.670> you<00:02:49.850> want<00:02:50.030> to<00:02:50.120> have<00:02:50.269> this<00:02:50.540> side<00:02:50.840> of

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
barbecue you want to have this side of

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.729 
barbecue you want to have this side of
the<00:02:51.080> barbecue<00:02:51.560> hot<00:02:51.799> and<00:02:52.069> this<00:02:52.760> side<00:02:53.000> off<00:02:53.239> and

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
the barbecue hot and this side off and

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.199 
the barbecue hot and this side off and
halfway<00:02:54.739> through<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.220> cooking<00:02:55.430> process<00:02:55.760> you

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
halfway through the cooking process you

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:57.820 
halfway through the cooking process you
could<00:02:56.390> rotate<00:02:56.600> it<00:02:56.989> so<00:02:57.170> that<00:02:57.350> if<00:02:57.530> it's<00:02:57.680> getting

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
could rotate it so that if it's getting

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.440 
could rotate it so that if it's getting
too<00:02:57.980> brown<00:02:58.310> on<00:02:58.489> this<00:02:58.640> side<00:02:58.910> you<00:02:59.120> want<00:02:59.269> to<00:02:59.360> give

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
too brown on this side you want to give

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.589 
too brown on this side you want to give
it<00:02:59.540> a<00:02:59.600> turn<00:03:00.610> removing<00:03:01.610> it<00:03:01.760> is<00:03:01.880> a<00:03:01.910> little<00:03:02.330> tricky

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
it a turn removing it is a little tricky

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.530 
it a turn removing it is a little tricky
but<00:03:03.470> I<00:03:03.739> would<00:03:04.010> say<00:03:04.190> just<00:03:04.430> have<00:03:04.640> you<00:03:05.239> know<00:03:05.360> your

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
but I would say just have you know your

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.130 
but I would say just have you know your
barbecue<00:03:05.959> tongs<00:03:06.170> and<00:03:06.680> you'll<00:03:07.099> be<00:03:07.250> fine<00:03:08.140> but

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
barbecue tongs and you'll be fine but

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.539 
barbecue tongs and you'll be fine but
you<00:03:09.170> can<00:03:09.440> see<00:03:10.900> how<00:03:11.900> juicy<00:03:12.260> this<00:03:12.680> bird<00:03:12.980> is<00:03:13.220> and

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
you can see how juicy this bird is and

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.050 
you can see how juicy this bird is and
you<00:03:14.299> want<00:03:14.420> to<00:03:14.599> take<00:03:14.720> it<00:03:14.930> off<00:03:15.080> when<00:03:15.590> it's<00:03:15.769> about

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
you want to take it off when it's about

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.580 
you want to take it off when it's about
165<00:03:17.060> because<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:17.780> temperature<00:03:18.200> will<00:03:18.349> rise

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
165 because the temperature will rise

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.890 
165 because the temperature will rise
and<00:03:18.980> that's<00:03:19.819> when<00:03:20.060> you<00:03:20.150> know<00:03:20.269> it's<00:03:20.299> done<00:03:20.660> and

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
and that's when you know it's done and

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.020 
and that's when you know it's done and
it's<00:03:21.440> looking<00:03:21.739> pretty<00:03:21.920> good<00:03:22.190> to<00:03:22.459> me<00:03:22.579> now

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.170 
it's looking pretty good to me now
I'll<00:03:23.150> take<00:03:23.750> the<00:03:23.900> temperature<00:03:24.410> and<00:03:24.560> we'll<00:03:24.680> see

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
I'll take the temperature and we'll see

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.979 
I'll take the temperature and we'll see
yeah<00:03:26.180> it's<00:03:26.450> at<00:03:26.660> 162<00:03:27.440> so<00:03:28.010> it's<00:03:28.480> almost<00:03:29.480> ready<00:03:29.750> to
