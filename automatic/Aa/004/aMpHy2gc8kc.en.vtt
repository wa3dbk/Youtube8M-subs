00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.920
 ae 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.380
 hello my dear my face you already touch 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.080
 or do you want to learn to play guitar? 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.630
 my name is paulo chaves and thanks for 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.190
 you're watching this video gives more 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.590
 play well 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.800
 today we will talk about beats and the 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.620
 that's beat beat it 's people act 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:57.010
 to play all or several strings of a 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:02:00.280
 only time is using movements in the 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.740
 vertical or up or down 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.810
 So, for example, I'm going to play here for 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.810
 you a beat down 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.860
 now I'm going to play a beat up 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.840
 it is important that the beat is played in the 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:22.220
 single movement at once 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:25.510
 pa if you make a slower movement 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.510
 for example 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.209
 this is not a beat when 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:35.420
 it's all at once 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:38.959
 Okay, but I will not get into the technique of 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:42.049
 beats in various styles nÃ© de beat 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:45.260
 It's a very tense subject, is not it? 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:47.180
 goes a whole method practically but 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.980
 I already have a very nice tip for you 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.380
 spend what I think will be very 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:55.160
 including useful for you to improve the 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.849
 Your knock moves are very 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.290
 common 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:00.290
 sometimes when someone will want to do 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.120
 beat if you use the movement of the 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.849
 forearm right 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.540
 the forearm this part of us here 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:13.010
 body because then it is very common to 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:15.680
 person is unwittingly try to use 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.989
 the movement of the forearm ne 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.170
 you can notice that keeping arm is 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.970
 going down and up like a parachute 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.799
 breeze from a car right? 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.470
 What happens is that when we do 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.609
 a movement is using the 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.620
 forearm 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:36.290
 the beat came out very heavy they leave 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.920
 There's something to go out of the way, the hard rhythm. 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.889
 huh 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.790
 a thing that has no more is not soft and 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:43.400
 delicious 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.880
 For example, I'll try to do it here. 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.209
 you 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.209
 look that 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:03.000
 finally right 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:05.940
 and I can not even touch it 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 now any of my tips when you 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:12.840
 is to start rather than move 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.600
 your forearm moves your fist 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.270
 if you wiggle your fist if who 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.440
 make the move is not your hand 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.390
 your forearm 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.990
 your movement will get much more 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.910
 take much more precise and much more 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.700
 even easy for you to play more 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.000
 fast is not how fast for example 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.000
 look that 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.990
 So my tip is this when you go. 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:04.750
 to make a beat using the movement of the 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.880
 hand is not forearm 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.520
 the forearm it will move a 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.470
 A little bit, he's finally stuck in the 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.080
 hand but who will actually make a 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:17.560
 movement is from the beat up and to the 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.640
 down is your hand comes from the fist and not from the 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.300
 forearm 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.300
 that's it
