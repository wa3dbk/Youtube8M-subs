00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
also I noticed on my locker that if you

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.400 
also I noticed on my locker that if you
look<00:00:16.710> at<00:00:16.859> it<00:00:16.890> it<00:00:17.160> says<00:00:17.310> mhm<00:00:17.900> that<00:00:18.900> sticks<00:00:19.199> out

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
look at it it says mhm that sticks out

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.179 
look at it it says mhm that sticks out
and<00:00:19.920> then<00:00:20.130> I<00:00:20.160> bought<00:00:20.490> him<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:21.000> says<00:00:22.189> NH

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
and then I bought him it says NH

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.900 
and then I bought him it says NH
backwards<00:00:23.910> but<00:00:24.630> it's<00:00:24.750> engraved<00:00:25.019> in<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:25.910> thought

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
backwards but it's engraved in I thought

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.490 
backwards but it's engraved in I thought
i'd<00:00:27.060> show<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.480> stuff<00:00:27.750> so<00:00:28.109> i<00:00:28.170> just<00:00:28.349> found

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
i'd show you that stuff so i just found

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.859 
i'd show you that stuff so i just found
out<00:00:28.800> that<00:00:29.580> i<00:00:29.820> think<00:00:30.000> this<00:00:30.269> looks<00:00:30.510> really<00:00:30.630> cool

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
out that i think this looks really cool

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.810 
out that i think this looks really cool
so<00:00:31.080> once<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.320> get<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.529> nice<00:00:31.590> try<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.309> i

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
so once you get the nice try it and i

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.860 
so once you get the nice try it and i
think<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.149> should<00:00:33.180> look<00:00:33.329> at<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.510> varmint

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
think you should look at the varmint

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.870 
think you should look at the varmint
will<00:00:33.960> be<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.110> local<00:00:34.500> wants<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.860> get<00:00:35.040> look<00:00:35.760> at

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
will be a local wants to get look at

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.520 
will be a local wants to get look at
them<00:00:36.000> or<00:00:36.120> they<00:00:36.450> might<00:00:36.600> have<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.989> air<00:00:37.230> hole

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
them or they might have the air hole

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.500 
them or they might have the air hole
goes<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.579> if<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.760> get<00:00:38.879> them<00:00:39.030> just<00:00:39.210> look<00:00:39.329> at<00:00:39.420> the

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
goes so if you get them just look at the

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
goes so if you get them just look at the
locker<00:00:40.190> bottom<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.280> talk<00:00:41.899> i'm<00:00:42.899> also<00:00:43.110> going<00:00:43.410> to
