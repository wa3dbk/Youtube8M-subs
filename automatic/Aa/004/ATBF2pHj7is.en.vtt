00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.439
 from the box so you can see the 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.689
 characteristics and we will explain 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.689

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.170
 ambidextrous that serves for both the hand 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.540

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:47.020
 only a weight of 20 grams 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:50.570
