 this can not show you the page 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.440
 because right now I do not have internet 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:42.180
 bad luck 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.980
 I do not have internet but that does not matter 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.470

 there will be a winrar file 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:57.780

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.200
 nothing difficult to extract here see me then 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.660

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.900
 wish 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:13.060
 and we will do it where they see it 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:13.060

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.110

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.969

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.969

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.820

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.020
 to the root of your psp you know the folder 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.180

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.780
 and they beat it they occupy who the criminal 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.780
 copy 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:51.370
 but I do not do it anymore because I already have it 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.909
 here is also 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.310
 this 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.740
 well that's easy that's all the 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.780
 procedure that on the computer does not 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.900
 it's nothing else I hope that I have 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:06.730
 it is understood 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:08.229
 this good as you know we're going to the I'm going 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.280

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.990
 it serves 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.530
 Of course it works is half heavy 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:18.100
 heavy and 200 megs 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:21.150

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.150

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.200

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.799
 when you are exam 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.460

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.450
