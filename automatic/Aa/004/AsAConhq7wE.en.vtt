00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.700 
there in 2451 or 50 I'm basically 2450

there in 2451 or 50 I'm basically 2450
if<00:05:25.390> you<00:05:25.570> take<00:05:25.840> my<00:05:26.110> 100<00:05:26.620> dungeoneering<00:05:27.160> into

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
if you take my 100 dungeoneering into

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.700 
if you take my 100 dungeoneering into
consideration<00:05:28.480> and<00:05:28.630> you<00:05:28.720> only<00:05:28.870> need<00:05:29.140> 99<00:05:29.530> for

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
consideration and you only need 99 for

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.460 
consideration and you only need 99 for
the<00:05:29.800> max<00:05:29.980> cape<00:05:30.220> so<00:05:30.520> i<00:05:30.700> am<00:05:31.090> 25<00:05:31.660> levels<00:05:31.930> currently

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
the max cape so i am 25 levels currently

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.190 
the max cape so i am 25 levels currently
off<00:05:32.650> the<00:05:32.710> max<00:05:33.130> cape<00:05:33.370> that<00:05:33.940> feels<00:05:34.450> amazing<00:05:35.050> is

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
off the max cape that feels amazing is

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.110 
off the max cape that feels amazing is
25<00:05:35.740> levels<00:05:35.950> does<00:05:36.220> not<00:05:36.430> seem<00:05:36.730> like<00:05:36.880> that<00:05:36.910> much

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
25 levels does not seem like that much

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.940 
25 levels does not seem like that much
obviously<00:05:37.930> these<00:05:38.080> levels<00:05:38.350> are<00:05:38.590> going<00:05:38.680> to<00:05:38.860> be

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
obviously these levels are going to be

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.800 
obviously these levels are going to be
very<00:05:39.100> slow<00:05:39.490> and<00:05:39.700> it's<00:05:40.150> going<00:05:40.330> to<00:05:40.390> take<00:05:40.570> a<00:05:40.600> long

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
very slow and it's going to take a long

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.560 
very slow and it's going to take a long
time<00:05:40.870> to<00:05:41.080> get<00:05:41.290> them<00:05:41.910> however<00:05:42.910> it's<00:05:43.150> really

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
time to get them however it's really

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.840 
time to get them however it's really

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.250 
probably very close and i am going to be

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:31.770 
probably very close and i am going to be
going<00:06:30.460> for<00:06:30.640> the<00:06:30.700> completion<00:06:31.030> escape<00:06:31.480> so<00:06:31.660> i'll

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:31.780 
going for the completion escape so i'll

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.540 
going for the completion escape so i'll
continue<00:06:32.110> using<00:06:32.410> this<00:06:32.650> calculator<00:06:33.160> even

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:33.550 
continue using this calculator even

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.610 
continue using this calculator even
after<00:06:33.730> i<00:06:33.970> finished<00:06:34.390> the<00:06:34.510> max<00:06:34.690> gate<00:06:34.960> i'll<00:06:35.380> have

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:35.620 
after i finished the max gate i'll have

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.350 
after i finished the max gate i'll have
to<00:06:35.800> change<00:06:36.370> the<00:06:36.610> name<00:06:36.760> of<00:06:36.790> the<00:06:36.940> series

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 
to change the name of the series

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.879 
to change the name of the series
to<00:06:37.509> the<00:06:37.629> road<00:06:37.810> to<00:06:37.960> completion<00:06:38.289> escape<00:06:38.710> or

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:38.889 
to the road to completion escape or

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:40.920 
to the road to completion escape or
something<00:06:39.219> like<00:06:39.310> that<00:06:39.370> but<00:06:39.930> unfortunately

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930 
something like that but unfortunately

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.029 
something like that but unfortunately
there<00:06:41.050> are<00:06:41.139> going<00:06:41.319> to<00:06:41.409> be<00:06:41.500> a<00:06:41.560> couple<00:06:41.770> new

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:42.039 
there are going to be a couple new

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:43.559 
there are going to be a couple new
skills<00:06:42.340> coming<00:06:42.669> out<00:06:42.759> pretty<00:06:42.879> soon<00:06:43.150> I'm<00:06:43.330> really

00:06:43.559 --> 00:06:43.569 
skills coming out pretty soon I'm really

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:45.209 
skills coming out pretty soon I'm really
not<00:06:43.689> looking<00:06:43.750> forward<00:06:44.050> to<00:06:44.349> those<00:06:44.560> but<00:06:44.860> it<00:06:45.069> is

00:06:45.209 --> 00:06:45.219 
not looking forward to those but it is

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:47.399 
not looking forward to those but it is
going<00:06:45.550> to<00:06:45.639> happen<00:06:45.789> and<00:06:46.150> i'll<00:06:46.689> have<00:06:46.810> to<00:06:47.050> grind

00:06:47.399 --> 00:06:47.409 
going to happen and i'll have to grind

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:49.709 
going to happen and i'll have to grind
those<00:06:47.620> out<00:06:47.860> to<00:06:48.039> 99<00:06:48.550> as<00:06:48.699> well<00:06:48.909> i'll<00:06:49.389> probably

00:06:49.709 --> 00:06:49.719 
those out to 99 as well i'll probably

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:51.689 
those out to 99 as well i'll probably
have<00:06:50.080> everything<00:06:50.530> else<00:06:50.710> at<00:06:50.860> 99<00:06:51.219> at<00:06:51.340> that<00:06:51.460> point

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:51.699 
have everything else at 99 at that point

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:53.459 
have everything else at 99 at that point
so<00:06:51.789> i'll<00:06:51.969> have<00:06:52.150> to<00:06:52.270> focus<00:06:52.479> on<00:06:52.780> just<00:06:52.930> one<00:06:53.050> or<00:06:53.439> two

00:06:53.459 --> 00:06:53.469 
so i'll have to focus on just one or two

00:06:53.469 --> 00:06:55.589 
so i'll have to focus on just one or two
skills<00:06:53.949> depending<00:06:54.490> on<00:06:54.580> what<00:06:55.270> the<00:06:55.389> time<00:06:55.569> frame

00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:55.599 
skills depending on what the time frame

00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:57.360 
skills depending on what the time frame
is<00:06:56.020> when<00:06:56.319> those<00:06:56.469> skills<00:06:56.710> come<00:06:56.919> out<00:06:57.039> so<00:06:57.250> that's

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:57.370 
is when those skills come out so that's

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:59.369 
is when those skills come out so that's
really<00:06:57.969> not<00:06:58.120> looking<00:06:58.300> good<00:06:58.569> and<00:06:58.810> I<00:06:58.930> wish<00:06:59.169> there

00:06:59.369 --> 00:06:59.379 
really not looking good and I wish there

00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:00.899 
really not looking good and I wish there
wouldn't<00:06:59.680> be<00:06:59.800> any<00:06:59.949> new<00:07:00.129> skills<00:07:00.430> but<00:07:00.669> there's

00:07:00.899 --> 00:07:00.909 
wouldn't be any new skills but there's

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:02.490 
wouldn't be any new skills but there's
not<00:07:01.120> really<00:07:01.330> a<00:07:01.419> whole<00:07:01.509> lot<00:07:01.780> that<00:07:01.990> you<00:07:02.199> can<00:07:02.349> do

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:02.500 
not really a whole lot that you can do

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.559 
not really a whole lot that you can do
about<00:07:02.620> it<00:07:02.770> so<00:07:03.490> anyway<00:07:03.879> if<00:07:04.030> you're<00:07:04.180> interested
