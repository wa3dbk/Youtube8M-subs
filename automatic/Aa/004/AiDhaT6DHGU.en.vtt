00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
Terran can really take i don't think

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.359 
Terran can really take i don't think
siege<00:01:42.960> tanks<00:01:43.350> can<00:01:43.500> reach<00:01:43.649> from<00:01:43.770> here<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:44.159> fact

siege tanks can reach from here in fact
i<00:01:44.520> think<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.820> would<00:01:44.880> be<00:01:45.030> really<00:01:45.060> long<00:01:45.659> if

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
i think that would be really long if

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.020 
i think that would be really long if
they<00:01:45.990> could<00:01:46.229> but<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.100> lot<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.670> new<00:01:47.820> maps

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
they could but a lot of the new maps

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.600 
they could but a lot of the new maps
what<00:01:48.689> people<00:01:49.020> really<00:01:49.320> like<00:01:49.649> about<00:01:49.829> them<00:01:50.220> or<00:01:50.490> i

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
what people really like about them or i

guess<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:51.030> remix<00:01:51.390> from<00:01:51.540> brood<00:01:51.780> war<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.170> that

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
guess the remix from brood war is that

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.499 
guess the remix from brood war is that
they<00:01:52.950> don't<00:01:53.189> have<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.549> weird<00:01:53.939> backdoor

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
easily no crazy ridges here where you

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
know like i said before siege tanks can

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.130 
know like i said before siege tanks can
drop<00:02:19.980> on<00:02:20.189> so<00:02:20.730> I<00:02:21.030> think<00:02:21.480> these<00:02:21.599> are<00:02:21.659> pretty<00:02:21.900> fair

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
drop on so I think these are pretty fair

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.349 
drop on so I think these are pretty fair
maps<00:02:22.379> panties<00:02:23.069> are<00:02:23.219> said<00:02:23.459> that<00:02:23.640> it's<00:02:23.849> kind<00:02:24.150> of

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:24.359 
maps panties are said that it's kind of

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:26.119

a<00:02:24.480> zerg<00:02:24.840> favorite<00:02:25.200> map<00:02:25.349> I<00:02:25.560> would<00:02:25.709> agree<00:02:25.799> it

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
a zerg favorite map I would agree it

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:27.860 
a zerg favorite map I would agree it
would<00:02:26.250> it's<00:02:26.609> definitely<00:02:26.849> more<00:02:27.180> Zerg<00:02:27.450> favored

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
would it's definitely more Zerg favored

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.009 
would it's definitely more Zerg favored

also notice this huge center area now
there<00:02:36.569> are<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:36.780> lot<00:02:37.109> of<00:02:37.139> these<00:02:37.379> ridges<00:02:37.980> and

can grab actually a super expansion if

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.459 
can grab actually a super expansion if
you<00:02:42.540> think<00:02:42.750> about<00:02:42.840> it<00:02:42.989> look<00:02:43.200> at<00:02:43.260> those

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:43.469 
you think about it look at those

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:45.020 
you think about it look at those
minerals<00:02:44.040> right<00:02:44.219> there<00:02:44.370> are<00:02:44.430> lots<00:02:44.639> of<00:02:44.819> money

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
grabs this if you do then you're

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.420 
grabs this if you do then you're
probably<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:49.799> know<00:02:49.829> winning<00:02:50.189> the<00:02:50.280> game

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
probably you know winning the game

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.479 
probably you know winning the game
already<00:02:50.819> but<00:02:51.780> there's<00:02:51.959> a<00:02:52.109> lot<00:02:52.650> of<00:02:52.680> area<00:02:53.310> in<00:02:53.400> the

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
already but there's a lot of area in the

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.909 
already but there's a lot of area in the
center<00:02:53.730> like<00:02:54.120> around<00:02:54.689> the<00:02:54.810> bottom<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.560> left

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:55.919 
center like around the bottom the left

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:57.679 
center like around the bottom the left
the<00:02:56.220> right<00:02:56.250> side<00:02:56.730> of<00:02:57.030> along<00:02:57.450> with<00:02:57.569> these

00:02:57.679 --> 00:02:57.689 
the right side of along with these

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:00.259 
the right side of along with these
watchtowers<00:02:58.349> which<00:02:58.859> makes<00:02:59.099> it<00:02:59.280> very<00:02:59.639> easy<00:02:59.909> for

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
watchtowers which makes it very easy for

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.479 
watchtowers which makes it very easy for
zerg<00:03:00.689> to<00:03:00.930> get<00:03:01.109> a<00:03:01.139> nice<00:03:01.409> flank<00:03:01.799> off<00:03:02.010> get<00:03:02.250> a<00:03:02.280> nice

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
zerg to get a nice flank off get a nice

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.459 
zerg to get a nice flank off get a nice
frontal<00:03:02.969> attack<00:03:03.209> and<00:03:03.480> a<00:03:03.599> flank<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:04.019> same<00:03:04.230> time

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:04.469 
frontal attack and a flank the same time

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:07.129 
frontal attack and a flank the same time
it's<00:03:05.370> this<00:03:05.849> is<00:03:06.030> much<00:03:06.329> more<00:03:06.540> difficult<00:03:06.689> to<00:03:06.959> do

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:07.139 
it's this is much more difficult to do

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:09.170 
it's this is much more difficult to do
with<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:07.889> current<00:03:08.129> official<00:03:08.669> maps<00:03:08.849> in<00:03:09.000> brood

war so enough about the actual map

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.220 
war so enough about the actual map
fighting<00:03:12.389> spirit<00:03:12.659> which<00:03:12.780> i<00:03:12.930> think<00:03:12.989> is<00:03:13.169> a

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
fighting spirit which i think is a
