00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.139
 in this video I'm going to make you one of the 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.060
 labile de castriz the textures and others 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.130
 that you have asked me when you say the 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.580
 game and good to explain is a little 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.949
 the textures and the ranges that there is good 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.320
 first of all tell you that there are two 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:30.470
 ranges one that I'm from achieved what 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.410
 more it lacks that it's worth for the 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.390
 pronunciation of the lips and good 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.840
 you can say the fallen to more this one that 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.660
 This is the silver packaging that is the 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.390
 last sainz vale 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:48.140
 and then there is another one that is this packaging 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.120
 black that are the ultimate color these 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.470
 are the two ranges that there are good and 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.900
 then the collection is that those 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.210
 are the part worth the difference of these 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.519
 two I 'll never first start with the 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.280
 there are these lipsticks have the 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.650
 particularity that they are quite 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.510
 moisturizing and do not give much color some 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.000
 colors this for example in particular if 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.400
 he gives it because it is a pretty strong color 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.970
 maybe there you are going to think that it gives 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.040
 a lot of color and then later in the room 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.850
 of the psoe is worth you see that it is enough 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.850
 moisturizing 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.259
 it's not very good mate kill us do not 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:28.869
 kill those who kill them is completely 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.520
 it does not carry if it's worth it but it has the shine 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:35.770
 that hydration characteristic of 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:39.009
 lipsticks this color is 210 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:43.170
 the kiss kiss' and whiskey that is super 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.170
 known they say it's a clone of him 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.440
 and well, that is the particularity that 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.090
 normally has this range of lipsticks 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.790
 they have a little pilot 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.590
 this has hydration video but the 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.780
 which are of this range usually have 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.790
 videos as well as if they are worth to me they are of those 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.100
 pearly that is called that that is 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.880
 pearly flame and they are practically all 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.160
 well with a little bit of canning so what 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.890
 that is in the labial is they are pretty 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.810
 Moisturizers do not hold much my lips 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.460
 I mean a lot of long hours though 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.580
 me if you hold me I have the lips 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:27.070
 quite dry without actually cracking m 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.270
 but to me water, we are very much and 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.910
 especially those that have more 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.500
 pigmentation like this for example then 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.090
 they always hold more because they have the most 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.490
 long than those who are a little hotter 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.190
 or have a little more color a little bit 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.110
 more clarito and good you see now you go to 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.840
 see the difference when I apply the 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.080
 another goes beyond the difference of one 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.820
 and from another 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.290
 the phone is ringing but with 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.790
 I'm not going to take it well 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.520
 continued with a madman the mom is 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:03:00.650
 ultimate color that are the blacks this 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:02.150
 mom are almost all are mates have more 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.830
 pigmentation than the others that 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.540
 last six and they're not all mate but the 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.400
 particularity that it has is that they have 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.220
 more color than what animals have 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:17.620
 a pigmentation more color and more 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.620
 mate that this for example is 80 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.990
 and you will see the difference when 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.400
 put it 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.799
 You see lady color 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.780
 being totally mate because he has that 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.150
 Moisture shine is worth not face 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.920
 of nothing, but look at the difference 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.019
 this one and this one shines more because it has 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.889
 more hydration and this less because 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.889
 it comes weeks 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.310
 that is the difference between a 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.310
 range and the other 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.170
 and good I'll show you another that I have 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.930
 and now I teach you also those of 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.600
 This collection of 110 also from the range 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.370
 ultimate color 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.060
 and well you are going to see that it is also 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.860
 quite pigmented 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.010
 is more than the others is that it does not shine 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.010
 so much 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:11.530
 I the truth is that I am delighted 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:13.720
 Many lipsticks I love are super me 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.790
 they love me I like the last ones 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:19.209
 colors than the last 6 because the 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.730
 last to have pearly tone are 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.590
 very light colors - the others are 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.120
 very clear colors there are two or three that 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.340
 they are also a little more pigmented 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.350
 but they are very clear colors and I do not 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.810
 I see I have to see one more uploaded as 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.180
 these two and I like it a lot but in 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.150
 general the lips of katrin I love 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.640
 has very good presentation are comfortable 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.850
 they do not crack they last a long time 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:45.340
 They smell very good and good are from invista 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:48.040
 ferida and good and then come those of 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.420
 collection of the collection normally 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.940
 for example I three that I have of 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.130
 collection of hollywood collection 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.470
 fabulous 40 years that are the ones 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.660
 they left because these three have the 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.490
 particularity that they are mates worth and 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.200
 I took them all because I 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.210
 they love matt colors and lips 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.330
 I love catherine and the colors 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.229
 they are precious I am going to teach 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.789
 the first one that I show you is good this 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:14.129
 street that you know that those of collection 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:16.050
 they always carry something different from the 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:18.120
 others some because there are others that is not 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.210
 It carries like a flower and so is good 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:24.169
 it stands out that it is from collection is 301 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.169
 and I'll show you 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.349
 and come this is completely worth 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:34.479
 you see the difference of these 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.830
 that these are matte but they have a 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:37.680
 little bit of hydration shine but 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.340
 it is not kill this mathematical 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.710
 completely but let's eat that 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:45.069
 absolute calamine nor are they comfortable 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:48.120
 They are creamy and they hold a lot 

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:48.120
 and the truth that has everything 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.300
 and less meets all three because I saw this 

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:54.949
 the colors and I fell in love 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.389
 and I've used them a lot a lot 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:58.720
 a lot is using them a lot they are 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:02.080
 those that most using lately 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:04.150
 and well I love this the 03 are 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.330
 little things like that a little more credit are 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:09.040
 everyone so pink because I like they are me 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.590
 they like the pink tones and both of the 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.960
 same of the same range of ss is a 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:16.000
 little bit more clarito more apagadito but 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.350
 you see also the difference of these 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.180
 that have a video of hydration and 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.370
 is although this will also go also 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.660
 I tell you that although they are killed to my measure 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.080
 is in the habit it dries me in the 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.080
 absolute 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:30.590
 and the last one I have is the c02 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:37.190
 and this is also a rose 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.200
 a little bit darker than the other but 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:41.060
 without being for all time and 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.130
 beige is that it was very used that what 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:45.140
 uses a lot because they are lipsticks 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:46.969
 I love beige master and the 

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:49.039
 difference these three 

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:51.409
 there you can see the difference perfectly 

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:52.600
 of the range and the difference and also 

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:54.760
 is 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:57.220
 and good the smell that they have the great 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.670
 it smells like more fruit 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.670
 all right 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:05.100
 and well, nothing else these are the 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.110
 lipsticks of katrice the ranges there 

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:09.090
 because you asked me what 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.350
 He had differences between them by 

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.729
 comments and others and mamis sent 

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:13.800
 messages that you can do a quick of 

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:16.199
 them when the sun says that you buy 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:18.120
 little things of katrin and well then here what 

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:19.650
 you have is quite short I send you a 

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.020
