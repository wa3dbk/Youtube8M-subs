and<00:00:09.170> there's<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.349> motor<00:00:10.950> that<00:00:11.460> I<00:00:12.380> purchased

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
and there's the motor that I purchased

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.110 
and there's the motor that I purchased
from<00:00:13.590> Harbor<00:00:14.009> Freight<00:00:14.040> which<00:00:14.759> I've<00:00:14.940> never

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
from Harbor Freight which I've never

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.029 
from Harbor Freight which I've never
purchased<00:00:15.690> anything<00:00:15.780> in<00:00:16.260> there<00:00:16.440> before<00:00:16.590> in<00:00:16.920> my

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
purchased anything in there before in my

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.890 
purchased anything in there before in my
life<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:18.890> it's<00:00:19.890> rated<00:00:20.310> at<00:00:20.490> 1,100<00:00:21.060> pounds<00:00:21.270> but

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
life and it's rated at 1,100 pounds but

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.340 
life and it's rated at 1,100 pounds but
I<00:00:22.289> don't<00:00:22.830> think<00:00:23.039> I'll<00:00:23.160> be<00:00:23.279> lifting<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:23.760> much

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350 
I don't think I'll be lifting that much

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.179 
I don't think I'll be lifting that much
so<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.710> goes<00:00:25.980> up<00:00:27.710> connects<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.859> four<00:00:29.070> different

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
so it goes up connects to four different

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.720 
so it goes up connects to four different
cables<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.590> then<00:00:31.590> connect<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.189> this<00:00:32.399> platform

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
cables and then connect to this platform

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.750 
cables and then connect to this platform
which<00:00:33.180> is<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:34.110> upstairs<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:34.860> my<00:00:34.980> garage<00:00:35.190> this

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
which is the upstairs of my garage this

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.190 
which is the upstairs of my garage this
is<00:00:35.820> 11<00:00:36.450> feet<00:00:36.840> off<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.820> garage<00:00:38.820> floor<00:00:39.360> in<00:00:39.899> my

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
is 11 feet off the garage floor in my

00:00:40.200 --> 00:01:04.850 
is 11 feet off the garage floor in my
workshop<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:47.989> platform<00:00:48.989> come<00:00:49.260> down<00:00:49.530> slowly

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.550 

I<00:01:04.890> thought<00:01:05.370> that<00:01:05.720> shortened<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.810> cables<00:01:07.290> and

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
I thought that shortened the cables and

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:17.280 
I thought that shortened the cables and
then<00:01:08.100> hide<00:01:08.820> them<00:01:08.940> all

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:24.910 

so<00:01:18.290> it's<00:01:18.410> down<00:01:20.830> then<00:01:21.830> we<00:01:21.950> look<00:01:22.160> up<00:01:23.410> all<00:01:24.410> the<00:01:24.740> up

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
so it's down then we look up all the up

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.670 
so it's down then we look up all the up
