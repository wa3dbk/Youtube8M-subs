00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:08.900
 Robo the robot that can detect various types of surgery, chasing the bird's movements at the airport 

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:13.250
 There seems to be no end to the development of robot technology, including 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.990
 In the past 14 days, various robots that can be used in various places 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:20.929
 Robot exhibition was held 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:26.480
 I went to the scene. Aka birds to pursue the three that flock around the plane. 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:27.949
 It was the first in the world to simultaneously detect and combat abuse 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.419
 It's a robot. 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:34.700
 I can chase birds through laser and Yin-Yang transmission, and I have various cameras. 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:39.080
 You can even monitor 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.490
 As part of the Government's robotization project, domestic companies developed and commercialized 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.990
 There is 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:50.900
 Rewrote the developed primarily to last year, now through the secondary Rover pilot project 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:53.390
 Completion of development until November and demonstration through 12 years at Seokdo Air Base 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:56.090
 We are going to run a business. 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:00.770
 It is the first fracture surgery robot in Korea. 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:04.640
 The force acting on the affected part is measured in real time and the excessive 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:09.680
 Prevents damage to bones and muscles from force 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:12.409
 Remote control and navigation system are used to precisely locate the bones 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:17.540
 Can be safely aligned 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:21.110
 The Chonnam National Institute of Robotics and thus the vessels treated with surgery and robotic rehabilitation 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:26.090
 Robots, such as the development of advanced robots uiryong 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.920
 These robots will be commercialized within a short period of one year to a long ten years . 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.570
 We are 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:36.020
 The cleaning robot out of 200 Gurin surgery seems to mean one million 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:41.090
 Value-parliamentary barrels Then China is seen as standing 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.170
 The country is also medical robot for approximately one won in a lot of hot pepper paste or chunghyodang 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.640
 There is 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:50.330
 The last 24 days in Ilsan Kintex is to show that all the country's robot industry 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:54.590
 RoboWorld 2013 exhibition was held 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:57.830
 It can be used in various fields such as educational robot for manufacturing and service 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:02.299
 It was set to show the technological power of the robots . 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.770
 What's more accomplished in the development of active technology and continuous investment company of the government 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:08.299
 The result is 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:11.660
 The robotic market in Korea has reached 2.1 trillion won 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:16.000
 We are growing steeply. 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.000
