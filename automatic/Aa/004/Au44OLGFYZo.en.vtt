 that it's really not much for 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.320
 some but it's really a very 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.359
 very big step for me when we open 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.619

 strongly 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.960

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.049
 costume jewelry but high quality 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.820
 are not the jewels that we can 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.280
 find at zara or h &amp; m these are 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.920
 really jewels above that are 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.540
 really very beautiful and and who are from 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.159
 great quality she sent me two 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.409
 things she sent me an accessory is 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.040
 a jewel so I decided to make 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.240
 the water actually since I completed this 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.799
 that she sent me with two small 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.520
 things that I even added because 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.090
 that I still wanted to 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.689
 participate 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.460
 myself then in lot number one he 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.990
 there will be the accessory that she has me 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.970
 sent this anecdote so this is the 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.290
 makeup bag it's a pouch 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.899
 that I will not open I'm going 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.140
 leave this pleasure to the winner who 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.470
 will have the chance to win this 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.640
 pencil case 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.560
 so it's a makeup bag 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.590
 it's the kit 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.939
 mosaic style I say no nonsense in 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.960
 anyway I very easily find 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.630
 on the site where I would put you 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.009
 outright the link berlin must therefore go 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.950
 white and black went all in 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.390
 mosaic in fact and then you look 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.650
 sign of the mark at this level there she 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.120
 is really very very pretty here for 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.980
 go on weekends etc 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.300
 I find it really perfect and more 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.130
 salty still big enough for 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.310
 put a lot of things inside 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.250
 she is really very very pretty and so 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.800
 to complete this little laugère added 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.730
 myself two little things it's not 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.600
 a lot but I still had 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.690
 want to participate 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.190
 so it's a lip balm from the 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.420
 body shop is the lip balm at the 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.600
 raspberry it seems to me that I you 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.410
 had already shown me since I have 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.670
 also right here and so I wanted you 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.989
 will put it so you'll see that it smells 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.330
 super good of course the product is 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:52.290
 completely new is still under 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.180
 sealed and so to complete this lot 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.410
 I added a varnish barrel even as 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.510
 I took you to London for a 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.130
 competition it's just a rally 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.269
 I found really super pretty this is the 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.380
 number 338 silver multi glitter and I 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.609
 do not know if you will see something 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.680
 but it's full of glitter 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:08.670
 gray and all colors in fact 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.380
 she glitters blue and 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.420
 green glitter pink sequins 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.010
 and the really pretty ones so that's not 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.780
 will be the first batch is in the lot 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.870
 number two so that's the jewel she 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.340
 so I can already see the packagings 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.440
 staelen lot if you do not know 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.780
 you know right now that it's 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.150
 really super cute so that will be like 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.470
 that and you actually take that off and you 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.530
 have the little box that is really 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.200
 super cute and so his stamps 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.170
 athletes down the people of your question 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.840
 that's the thing so it's a bracelet 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.280
 emerald green in very large mesh and 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.260
 it's really perfect I find 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.609
 really very very pretty is what we 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.620
 Well, it's even me who has a 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:49.829
 recchi wrist that fits perfectly 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.310
 and it's not really their thing at 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:53.989
 that hang from everywhere so really a 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.760
 a jewel really super pretty that I 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.319
 is really very very beautiful so 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.610
 this is for lot number 2 and for 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.780
 complete I added two more 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.930
 little things so I added a 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.790
 varnish siat and that is the mojito 0,19 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.890
 so I do not think you'll come up big 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.890
 thing on camera it's a glass actually 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:13.340
 a simple glass so what is the 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:16.489
 mojito and I added to a smart that 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.919
 do they think of checchi that in hues 700 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.139
 one of which is a cry in pink actually 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.330
 that I myself love that much and 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.650
 of course all products are still 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.030
 under seals for sow this was the case 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.320
 so that's for these two small lots I 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.150
 will hurry up because I see that 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.380
 I have no battery it was there 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.030
 again I really thank you 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.440

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.419
 really great thank you very much 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.010
 and so I go to the conditions I can 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.810
 not ask you the lake and the video of 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.200
 share the video etc you take the 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.720
 head 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.280
 it will just obviously have to be 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.100
 subscriber to my channel since this contest 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.260
 is reserved only for my subscribers 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.479
 necessarily and I'm just going to ask you 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.850
 also from there is the facebook page 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:54.380

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.790
 othe staelen that I would put you well 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.560

 still the minimum given 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.680

 at stan dot 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.919

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.090
 really very very happy so that's it 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:05.539
