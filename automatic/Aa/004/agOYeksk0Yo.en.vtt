thanks<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.220> EPS<00:03:17.640> power<00:03:17.880> steering<00:03:18.360> did<00:03:18.989> I

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
thanks to the EPS power steering did I

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.150 
thanks to the EPS power steering did I
need<00:03:19.260> it<00:03:19.440> no<00:03:19.980> do<00:03:20.519> I<00:03:20.579> like<00:03:20.790> it<00:03:21.000> yeah<00:03:21.709> the<00:03:22.709> EPS

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
need it no do I like it yeah the EPS

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.400 
need it no do I like it yeah the EPS
system<00:03:23.400> does<00:03:23.910> add<00:03:24.120> weight<00:03:24.359> and<00:03:24.600> increases<00:03:25.290> the

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
price of the apex without a doubt but

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.410 
price of the apex without a doubt but
all<00:03:27.930> apex<00:03:28.440> is<00:03:28.590> for<00:03:28.769> 2012<00:03:29.579> come<00:03:30.090> with<00:03:30.209> power

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
all apex is for 2012 come with power

all apex is for 2012 come with power
steering<00:03:30.720> so<00:03:31.410> get<00:03:31.590> over<00:03:31.620> it<00:03:31.890> I<00:03:32.190> did<00:03:32.850> find<00:03:33.120> the

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
steering so get over it I did find the

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520
