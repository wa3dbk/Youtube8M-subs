00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.530 
know although they did take away Chloe's
ass<00:03:33.859> so<00:03:34.189> that<00:03:34.430> was<00:03:34.549> kind<00:03:34.790> of<00:03:34.819> depressing<00:03:35.180> Chloe

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
uncharted two so when she said you're

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.939 
uncharted two so when she said you're
going<00:03:41.840> to<00:03:41.900> miss<00:03:42.049> this<00:03:42.199> ass<00:03:42.439> at<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:42.799> end<00:03:42.889> of

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.390 
uncharted two I guess he meant it
literally<00:03:44.810> because<00:03:45.169> they<00:03:45.739> took<00:03:45.919> it<00:03:45.979> away<00:03:46.099> and

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
literally because they took it away and

the<00:05:40.760> single<00:05:41.060> player<00:05:41.120> is<00:05:41.360> really<00:05:41.660> great<00:05:41.900> and<00:05:41.960> a

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
the single player is really great and a

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.100 
the single player is really great and a
lot<00:05:42.980> of<00:05:43.010> fun<00:05:43.280> and<00:05:43.630> if<00:05:44.630> you<00:05:44.810> don't<00:05:44.960> have

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110
