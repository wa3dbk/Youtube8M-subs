if you're going to cast metal into a
mold<00:00:05.600> you<00:00:06.600> need<00:00:06.810> to<00:00:06.990> know<00:00:07.140> exactly<00:00:07.490> how<00:00:08.490> much

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
mold you need to know exactly how much

mold you need to know exactly how much
metal<00:00:09.559> fits<00:00:11.000> because<00:00:12.000> you<00:00:12.420> can't<00:00:13.280> slowly<00:00:14.280> tip

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
metal fits because you can't slowly tip

meddle<00:00:15.929> in<00:00:16.080> until<00:00:16.650> it's<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:18.020> correct<00:00:19.020> depth

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
meddle in until it's the correct depth

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.070 
meddle in until it's the correct depth
because<00:00:20.369> if<00:00:20.640> you<00:00:20.789> do<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.240> you'll<00:00:21.600> have<00:00:21.660> what

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
because if you do that you'll have what

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.189 
because if you do that you'll have what
they<00:00:22.230> call<00:00:22.260> hesitation<00:00:23.189> marks<00:00:23.400> on<00:00:23.990> the<00:00:24.990> metal

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
they call hesitation marks on the metal

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.779 
they call hesitation marks on the metal
and<00:00:25.470> when<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.769> go<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:25.949> roll<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.340> out<00:00:26.490> it'll

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
and when you go to roll it out it'll

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.210 
and when you go to roll it out it'll
crack<00:00:27.090> at<00:00:27.300> those<00:00:27.510> spots<00:00:27.920> so<00:00:28.920> when<00:00:29.070> you're

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
crack at those spots so when you're

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.000 
crack at those spots so when you're
casting<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:30.090> need<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.570> nice<00:00:31.080> steady<00:00:31.560> flow<00:00:34.010> so

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
casting you need a nice steady flow so

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.310 
casting you need a nice steady flow so
you<00:00:35.100> need<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.670> know<00:00:35.820> if<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.480> have<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.870> exact

grams<00:01:54.380> per<00:01:55.270> cubic<00:01:56.270> centimeter<00:01:57.460> so<00:01:58.600> as<00:01:59.600> you<00:01:59.960> can

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
grams per cubic centimeter so as you can

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.510 
grams per cubic centimeter so as you can
tell<00:02:00.640> the<00:02:01.640> different<00:02:02.030> weights<00:02:02.270> of<00:02:02.510> the<00:02:02.660> middle

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
tell the different weights of the middle

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.960

the<00:02:04.520> same<00:02:04.880> volume<00:02:05.390> of<00:02:06.250> different<00:02:07.250> metals<00:02:07.460> will

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
the same volume of different metals will

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.800 
the same volume of different metals will
be<00:02:08.179> radically<00:02:08.780> different<00:02:09.580> so<00:02:10.580> you<00:02:11.420> need<00:02:11.630> to

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
be radically different so you need to

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.620 
be radically different so you need to
know<00:02:11.960> the<00:02:12.140> metal<00:02:12.470> and<00:02:12.620> you<00:02:12.770> need<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.130> know<00:02:13.280> the

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
know the metal and you need to know the

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.120 
know the metal and you need to know the
volume<00:02:15.280> now<00:02:16.280> figuring<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.330> volume<00:02:17.750> of<00:02:18.620> the

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
volume now figuring the volume of the

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.660 
volume now figuring the volume of the
square<00:02:19.640> or<00:02:19.940> a<00:02:19.970> rectangle<00:02:21.190> is<00:02:22.190> quite<00:02:22.640> easy

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
square or a rectangle is quite easy

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.300 
square or a rectangle is quite easy
because<00:02:23.090> it's<00:02:23.660> just<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:24.650> length<00:02:24.860> times<00:02:24.980> the

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
because it's just the length times the

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.570 
because it's just the length times the
width<00:02:25.550> times<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:26.060> height<00:02:26.590> once<00:02:27.590> again<00:02:27.800> if<00:02:28.280> you

sterling<00:02:44.660> which<00:02:44.900> is<00:02:45.080> 10.4<00:02:45.920> so<00:02:46.340> it's<00:02:46.459> it's<00:02:46.850> easy

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
sterling which is 10.4 so it's it's easy

now<00:02:55.980> when<00:02:56.130> you're<00:02:56.280> doing<00:02:56.520> lost<00:02:56.760> wax<00:02:57.030> casting

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
now when you're doing lost wax casting

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.410 
now when you're doing lost wax casting
you<00:02:58.920> need<00:02:59.130> to<00:02:59.340> know<00:02:59.490> the<00:02:59.670> weight<00:02:59.850> of<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.120> metal

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
you need to know the weight of the metal

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.460 
you need to know the weight of the metal
that<00:03:01.050> you're<00:03:01.260> using<00:03:01.970> so<00:03:02.970> really<00:03:03.930> you<00:03:04.110> need<00:03:04.290> to

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
that you're using so really you need to

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.180 
that you're using so really you need to
know<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.830> weight<00:03:05.010> of<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.820> wax<00:03:07.010> when<00:03:08.010> you

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
know the weight of the wax when you

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.950 
know the weight of the wax when you
start<00:03:09.710> you<00:03:10.710> always<00:03:11.280> weigh<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:11.760> base<00:03:11.970> if

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
start you always weigh the base if

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.350 
start you always weigh the base if
you're<00:03:13.680> in<00:03:13.830> a<00:03:13.920> school<00:03:14.220> situation<00:03:14.790> you<00:03:15.120> always

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
you're in a school situation you always

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.090 
you're in a school situation you always
get<00:03:15.540> a<00:03:15.570> different<00:03:15.960> base<00:03:16.140> so<00:03:16.470> you<00:03:16.530> never<00:03:16.800> know

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
get a different base so you never know

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.030 
get a different base so you never know
if<00:03:17.460> you're<00:03:17.670> at<00:03:17.820> home<00:03:18.260> you<00:03:19.260> can<00:03:19.290> weigh<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.830> base

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
if you're at home you can weigh the base

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.320 
if you're at home you can weigh the base
and<00:03:21.440> if<00:03:22.440> you<00:03:22.680> engrave<00:03:23.280> that<00:03:23.640> weight<00:03:23.940> on<00:03:24.150> your

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
and if you engrave that weight on your

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.880 
and if you engrave that weight on your
base<00:03:24.540> then<00:03:24.960> you<00:03:25.110> never<00:03:25.260> have<00:03:25.410> to<00:03:25.710> do<00:03:25.830> that

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
base then you never have to do that

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.310 
base then you never have to do that
again<00:03:26.240> but<00:03:27.240> you<00:03:27.420> need<00:03:27.600> to<00:03:27.720> know<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:28.050> weight<00:03:28.200> of

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
again but you need to know the weight of

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.910 
again but you need to know the weight of
the<00:03:28.410> base<00:03:28.910> because<00:03:29.910> as<00:03:30.330> you<00:03:31.200> make<00:03:31.380> your<00:03:31.410> tree

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
the base because as you make your tree

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.490 
the base because as you make your tree
and<00:03:32.220> you<00:03:32.370> add<00:03:32.550> the<00:03:32.730> wax<00:03:33.110> when<00:03:34.110> you're<00:03:34.290> finished

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
and you add the wax when you're finished

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.160 
and you add the wax when you're finished
you<00:03:35.570> weigh<00:03:36.830> the<00:03:37.830> whole<00:03:38.070> thing<00:03:38.400> again<00:03:38.760> and<00:03:39.170> that

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
you weigh the whole thing again and that

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.250 
you weigh the whole thing again and that
if<00:03:40.440> you<00:03:41.070> subtract<00:03:41.610> the<00:03:41.730> two<00:03:42.060> that<00:03:42.840> will<00:03:43.050> give

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
if you subtract the two that will give

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.470 
if you subtract the two that will give
you<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:43.500> weight<00:03:43.680> of<00:03:43.800> the<00:03:43.920> wax<00:03:44.130> or<00:03:44.550> you<00:03:45.330> can

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
you the weight of the wax or you can

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.240 
you the weight of the wax or you can
just<00:03:45.600> pop<00:03:45.900> this<00:03:46.050> thing<00:03:46.110> off<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.500> bottom<00:03:46.950> way

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
just pop this thing off the bottom way

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:53.690 
just pop this thing off the bottom way
your<00:03:47.520> wax<00:03:47.760> and<00:03:48.590> melt<00:03:49.590> that<00:03:49.800> back<00:03:50.100> on<00:03:50.960> now<00:03:52.700> wax

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.560 
to then start dropping your metal in and
when<00:05:52.470> it<00:05:52.620> gets<00:05:52.830> up<00:05:53.130> to<00:05:53.370> the<00:05:53.490> new<00:05:53.669> line<00:05:54.000> that's

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570 
when it gets up to the new line that's

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.730 
when it gets up to the new line that's
the<00:05:54.900> volume<00:05:55.320> of<00:05:55.530> metal<00:05:55.889> that<00:05:56.100> you<00:05:56.340> need<00:05:57.740> it's

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
the volume of metal that you need it's

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.550 
the volume of metal that you need it's
kind<00:05:59.040> of<00:05:59.130> a<00:05:59.250> rough<00:05:59.490> way<00:06:00.419> to<00:06:00.450> do<00:06:00.840> it<00:06:00.960> but<00:06:01.410> it's

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
kind of a rough way to do it but it's

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.860 
kind of a rough way to do it but it's
very<00:06:01.770> accurate<00:06:02.100> because<00:06:02.640> all<00:06:03.120> we're<00:06:03.540> going

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
very accurate because all we're going

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.830 
very accurate because all we're going
for<00:06:04.169> is<00:06:04.380> volume<00:06:04.950> and<00:06:05.190> like<00:06:06.090> I've<00:06:06.300> said<00:06:06.330> with

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 
for is volume and like I've said with

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.490 
for is volume and like I've said with
specific<00:06:07.410> gravity<00:06:07.950> like<00:06:08.910> aluminium<00:06:09.180> is<00:06:10.110> quite

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
specific gravity like aluminium is quite

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.779 
specific gravity like aluminium is quite
a<00:06:10.530> low<00:06:10.890> number<00:06:11.300> so<00:06:12.650> the<00:06:13.650> same<00:06:14.010> volume<00:06:14.400> of

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:14.789 
a low number so the same volume of

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:17.890 
a low number so the same volume of
aluminium<00:06:15.240> will<00:06:16.110> be<00:06:16.260> ridiculously<00:06:17.160> lighter

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:17.900 
aluminium will be ridiculously lighter

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:23.690 
aluminium will be ridiculously lighter
than<00:06:18.900> the<00:06:19.560> same<00:06:19.830> volume<00:06:20.160> of<00:06:20.580> silver<00:06:21.680> so<00:06:22.700> you

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:23.700 
than the same volume of silver so you

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.930 
than the same volume of silver so you
always<00:06:23.940> need<00:06:24.419> to<00:06:24.570> know<00:06:25.070> the<00:06:26.070> volume<00:06:26.280> of<00:06:26.729> what

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 
always need to know the volume of what

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.630 
always need to know the volume of what
you're<00:06:27.150> casting
