00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:06.620
 hi guys in this video tutorial today 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:14.480
 I'll teach you to make this romantic. 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:17.090
 And simple hairstyle, well to start, let's go. 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.400
 take a piece of hair not side 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.300
 It needs to be neither too thick and too 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.759
 thin 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.759
 Let's start making a common braid. 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.610
 here we are at the end of my braid 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.480
 until there is more hair left and you see 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:50.900
 It does not really work anymore 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:55.250
 It's done, let's roll the tip of the 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:01:01.910
 hair as I'm doing wig points 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:06.100
 one with the other and tie with the think so 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.100
 will help us at the end of the history 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.030
 Now let's go the other way. 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.990
 do the same thing that was done in the 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.320
 beginning 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:38.369
 the braid and when finishing the bridge is 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.369
 marie with elastic 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:31.140
 done that now let's get the first 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:33.200
 braid wrap her around and put her 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.640
 on the other side just like I'm doing 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.510
 remember the tip that I do not know to 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.750
 you 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.269
 it will help to hide there and not 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.060
 show the tip of the hair as well as 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.909
 I'm doing secure with a staple and 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:55.650
 that tip put under the other 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:58.379
 braid done that now let's involve the 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.650
 another braid again in the back 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:03.409
 take her there to the other side and 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.420
 staple it 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:08.909
 how can you see the other side of my 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.129
 hair piece I got is smaller than 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:13.980
 the other then in the tutorial it goes 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:18.500
 make a difference, but if you have the 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.500
 big hair will look great 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:25.530
 do not let it appear appear put it 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:34.109
 under the other braid and hide 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:36.239
 Who is going to look much better here? 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:38.370
 is our end result hopefully 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:42.230
 You liked it and look forward to it. 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.230
