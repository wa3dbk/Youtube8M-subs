bville and now we're going to drag that

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.920 
bville and now we're going to drag that
up<00:01:22.009> I'm<00:01:23.009> going<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.280> small<00:01:24.090> on<00:01:24.270> them<00:01:24.420> make<00:01:24.750> them

up I'm going to small on them make them
small<00:01:25.380> like<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:27.320> let's<00:01:28.320> switch<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.560> our<00:01:28.820> full

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
small like that let's switch to our full

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.560 
small like that let's switch to our full
3d<00:01:30.390> view<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:31.409> we're<00:01:31.500> going<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.650> drag<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.009> up

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
3d view and we're going to drag that up

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.120 
3d view and we're going to drag that up
to<00:01:33.799> just<00:01:34.799> until<00:01:35.100> it's<00:01:35.520> like<00:01:35.880> inside<00:01:37.130> the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
others but not protruding them so let's

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.410 
others but not protruding them so let's

okay<00:02:03.520> so<00:02:04.180> we<00:02:04.300> got<00:02:04.690> a<00:02:04.750> sub<00:02:05.020> D<00:02:05.260> to<00:02:05.470> see<00:02:05.650> where<00:02:05.800> that

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
okay so we got a sub D to see where that

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.500 
okay so we got a sub D to see where that
looks<00:02:06.159> like<00:02:06.310> an<00:02:06.430> a<00:02:06.520> you<00:02:06.640> can<00:02:06.790> see<00:02:07.000> we've<00:02:07.240> got

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
looks like an a you can see we've got

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.180 
looks like an a you can see we've got
our<00:02:07.690> little<00:02:08.399> fins<00:02:09.399> in<00:02:09.729> me<00:02:10.740> which<00:02:11.740> is<00:02:11.920> what<00:02:12.069> we

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
our little fins in me which is what we

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.270 
our little fins in me which is what we
want<00:02:12.430> it<00:02:12.610> now<00:02:13.600> funnily<00:02:14.230> enough<00:02:14.230> we<00:02:14.800> can<00:02:15.010> see

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
want it now funnily enough we can see

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.000 
want it now funnily enough we can see
that<00:02:15.490> that's<00:02:15.730> just<00:02:16.330> just<00:02:16.959> just<00:02:17.319> sticking<00:02:17.800> out

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
that that's just just just sticking out

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.480 
that that's just just just sticking out
a<00:02:18.069> little<00:02:18.310> bit<00:02:18.730> thee<00:02:18.970> so<00:02:19.930> to<00:02:20.110> fix<00:02:20.380> that<00:02:20.770> I'm

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
a little bit thee so to fix that I'm

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.910 
a little bit thee so to fix that I'm
just<00:02:21.610> going<00:02:21.820> to<00:02:21.850> select<00:02:22.720> that<00:02:22.930> and<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:23.500> loop<00:02:23.709> it

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
just going to select that and a loop it

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.790 
just going to select that and a loop it
nope<00:02:24.340> select<00:02:25.209> two<00:02:25.450> loops<00:02:25.750> like<00:02:25.959> that<00:02:26.230> if

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
nope select two loops like that if

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.060 
nope select two loops like that if
you're<00:02:27.040> going<00:02:27.070> to<00:02:27.190> go<00:02:27.340> back<00:02:27.580> up<00:02:27.610> to<00:02:28.000> that<00:02:28.030> point

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
you're going to go back up to that point

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.360 
you're going to go back up to that point
and<00:02:30.070> those<00:02:30.640> two<00:02:30.910> and<00:02:31.180> loop<00:02:31.480> it<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.950> it's<00:02:33.100> still

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
and those two and loop it and it's still

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.220 
and those two and loop it and it's still
not<00:02:33.430> what<00:02:33.790> I<00:02:33.819> want<00:02:34.120> so<00:02:34.810> I'm<00:02:34.870> going<00:02:34.930> to<00:02:35.080> have<00:02:35.200> to

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
not what I want so I'm going to have to

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.060 
not what I want so I'm going to have to
do<00:02:35.410> this<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.620> hard<00:02:35.950> way<00:02:37.739> actually<00:02:38.739> we'll

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
do this the hard way actually we'll

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.300 
do this the hard way actually we'll
leave<00:02:39.220> it<00:02:39.340> for<00:02:39.370> now<00:02:39.760> let's<00:02:40.239> um<00:02:40.510> I<00:02:40.870> don't<00:02:41.800> think

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
leave it for now let's um I don't think

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.100 
leave it for now let's um I don't think
it<00:02:42.610> actually<00:02:42.730> is<00:02:43.000> showing<00:02:43.060> through<00:02:43.780> the

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
it actually is showing through the

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.220 
it actually is showing through the
geometry<00:02:44.920> is<00:02:45.100> it<00:02:45.280> no<00:02:46.030> it's<00:02:46.239> not<00:02:46.330> let's<00:02:46.810> just<00:02:46.870> oh

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
geometry is it no it's not let's just oh

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.490 
geometry is it no it's not let's just oh
maybe<00:02:47.739> a<00:02:47.920> little<00:02:48.160> bit<00:02:48.519> over<00:02:48.790> there<00:02:49.260> but<00:02:50.260> it's

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
maybe a little bit over there but it's

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.699 
maybe a little bit over there but it's
very<00:02:50.739> marginal<00:02:51.489> so<00:02:53.610> don't<00:02:54.610> forgot<00:02:55.530> we'll<00:02:56.530> just

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
very marginal so don't forgot we'll just

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:03.990 
very marginal so don't forgot we'll just
scale<00:02:57.190> this<00:02:57.670> out<00:02:57.940> a<00:02:57.970> little<00:02:58.090> bit<00:03:02.519> that's<00:03:03.519> not

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
scale this out a little bit that's not

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.330 
scale this out a little bit that's not
what<00:03:04.120> I<00:03:04.180> want<00:03:04.450> there's<00:03:05.320> not<00:03:05.470> being<00:03:05.769> forgiving

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
what I want there's not being forgiving

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.520 
what I want there's not being forgiving
with<00:03:06.459> me<00:03:06.730> so<00:03:07.030> one<00:03:08.010> lets<00:03:09.010> a<00:03:09.390> model<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:10.600> other<00:03:11.140> in

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
with me so one lets a model the other in

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.380 
with me so one lets a model the other in
first<00:03:11.950> and<00:03:12.190> then<00:03:12.430> we'll<00:03:12.519> worry<00:03:12.760> about<00:03:12.880> fixing

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
first and then we'll worry about fixing

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.810 
first and then we'll worry about fixing
that<00:03:13.720> so<00:03:14.049> let's<00:03:14.320> loop<00:03:14.620> that<00:03:15.660> ok<00:03:17.640> so<00:03:18.640> that's

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
that so let's loop that ok so that's

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.090 
that so let's loop that ok so that's
good<00:03:19.360> we've<00:03:19.750> got<00:03:19.959> the<00:03:20.140> whole<00:03:20.170> ring<00:03:20.560> selected

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
good we've got the whole ring selected

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.250 
good we've got the whole ring selected
so<00:03:21.310> we'll<00:03:21.519> use<00:03:21.549> the<00:03:22.030> bevel<00:03:22.450> p<00:03:22.630> again<00:03:22.959> and<00:03:25.260> if

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
so we'll use the bevel p again and if

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.430 
so we'll use the bevel p again and if
you<00:03:26.440> had<00:03:26.530> sana<00:03:27.570> press<00:03:28.570> space<00:03:28.840> drop<00:03:29.079> the<00:03:29.200> tour

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
you had sana press space drop the tour

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.400 
you had sana press space drop the tour
just<00:03:29.620> want<00:03:29.799> to<00:03:29.890> check<00:03:30.160> something<00:03:30.220> in<00:03:30.790> here

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
just want to check something in here

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.250 
just want to check something in here
that<00:03:32.410> we're<00:03:32.560> not<00:03:32.650> going<00:03:32.799> to<00:03:32.890> run<00:03:33.070> out<00:03:33.100> of<00:03:33.250> space

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
that we're not going to run out of space

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.479 
that we're not going to run out of space
perhaps<00:03:35.260> we<00:03:35.470> are<00:03:35.650> going<00:03:35.829> to<00:03:35.890> run<00:03:36.070> out<00:03:36.100> of<00:03:36.280> space

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
perhaps we are going to run out of space

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.000 
perhaps we are going to run out of space
so<00:03:36.700> let's<00:03:37.090> am<00:03:37.329> just<00:03:37.660> select<00:03:37.959> this<00:03:38.140> loop<00:03:38.530> here

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
so let's am just select this loop here

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.850 
so let's am just select this loop here
on<00:03:39.459> the<00:03:39.970> line<00:03:40.150> mode<00:03:40.450> w<00:03:41.079> and<00:03:41.260> just<00:03:41.500> pull<00:03:41.680> that<00:03:41.709> a

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
on the line mode w and just pull that a

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.050 
on the line mode w and just pull that a
bit<00:03:42.070> away<00:03:42.450> just<00:03:43.450> like<00:03:43.570> that<00:03:43.980> okay<00:03:44.980> and<00:03:45.790> I<00:03:45.880> might

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
bit away just like that okay and I might

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.390 
bit away just like that okay and I might
do<00:03:46.239> the<00:03:46.390> same<00:03:46.420> with<00:03:46.750> this<00:03:46.870> one<00:03:46.930> and<00:03:47.380> we'll<00:03:48.130> loop

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
do the same with this one and we'll loop

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.610 
do the same with this one and we'll loop
it<00:03:48.640> w<00:03:49.570> it<00:03:49.660> and<00:03:49.810> we'll<00:03:49.900> just<00:03:50.079> push<00:03:50.260> that<00:03:50.440> one

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
it w it and we'll just push that one

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.460 
it w it and we'll just push that one
back<00:03:50.829> a<00:03:50.860> bit<00:03:51.100> more<00:03:51.600> okay<00:03:52.600> so<00:03:53.230> i'm<00:03:53.320> going<00:03:53.410> to

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
back a bit more okay so i'm going to

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.340 
back a bit more okay so i'm going to
press<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:53.860> bevel<00:03:54.280> key<00:03:54.489> again<00:03:54.850> and<00:03:55.350> we're

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
press the bevel key again and we're

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.240 
press the bevel key again and we're
going<00:03:56.470> to<00:03:56.500> approach<00:03:56.739> this<00:03:56.980> slightly

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
going to approach this slightly

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.800 
going to approach this slightly
different<00:03:57.730> we're<00:03:57.880> going<00:03:57.910> to<00:03:58.090> group<00:03:58.390> at<00:03:58.630> this

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
different we're going to group at this

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.390 
different we're going to group at this
time<00:03:59.049> we're<00:03:59.769> going<00:03:59.859> to<00:03:59.920> click<00:04:00.160> on<00:04:00.190> our

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
time we're going to click on our

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.710 
time we're going to click on our
viewport<00:04:00.820> and<00:04:01.030> we're<00:04:01.630> going<00:04:01.750> to<00:04:01.780> drag<00:04:02.200> it<00:04:02.230> in

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
viewport and we're going to drag it in

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.180 
viewport and we're going to drag it in
so<00:04:04.720> we're<00:04:04.870> doing<00:04:05.019> it<00:04:05.109> like<00:04:05.260> this<00:04:05.290> and<00:04:05.680> a<00:04:05.980> press

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
so we're doing it like this and a press

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.199 
so we're doing it like this and a press
spacebar<00:04:06.540> drop<00:04:07.540> our<00:04:07.720> bevel<00:04:07.959> tool<00:04:09.030> so<00:04:10.030> now

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
spacebar drop our bevel tool so now

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.710 
spacebar drop our bevel tool so now

quantity of two this time and we want
symmetry<00:04:27.560> on<00:04:27.740> and<00:04:28.690> we'll<00:04:29.690> drag<00:04:30.020> that<00:04:30.320> out

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
symmetry on and we'll drag that out

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.150 
symmetry on and we'll drag that out
until<00:04:31.310> it's<00:04:31.670> sort<00:04:31.910> of<00:04:32.000> like<00:04:32.150> Tim<00:04:32.570> %<00:04:32.980> will<00:04:33.980> hit

spacebar<00:04:35.620> okay<00:04:36.620> that's<00:04:36.890> good<00:04:40.420> actually<00:04:41.420> I'm

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
spacebar okay that's good actually I'm

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
spacebar okay that's good actually I'm
changing<00:04:42.170> my<00:04:42.200> mind<00:04:42.470> again<00:04:43.810> one<00:04:44.810> do<00:04:45.020> that<00:04:47.710> what

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
changing my mind again one do that what

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.380 
changing my mind again one do that what
we're<00:04:48.890> going<00:04:49.010> to<00:04:49.100> do<00:04:49.340> is<00:04:51.010> we're<00:04:52.010> going<00:04:52.160> to<00:04:52.390> and

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
we're going to do is we're going to and

00:04:53.390 --> 00:05:00.900 
we're going to do is we're going to and
loop<00:04:54.230> it

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.210 

what's<00:05:01.510> our<00:05:01.690> geometry<00:05:02.020> what's<00:05:02.590> it<00:05:02.770> looks<00:05:03.010> like

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
what's our geometry what's it looks like

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.760 
what's our geometry what's it looks like
over<00:05:03.520> thee<00:05:03.990> okay<00:05:04.990> so<00:05:05.050> it<00:05:05.230> looks<00:05:05.290> like<00:05:05.500> that<00:05:06.240> ok

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
over thee okay so it looks like that ok

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:15.750 
over thee okay so it looks like that ok
so<00:05:08.770> let's<00:05:09.010> look<00:05:09.220> at<00:05:09.430> what<00:05:09.670> we<00:05:09.820> can<00:05:09.850> do<00:05:14.610> ok<00:05:15.610> we're

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
so let's look at what we can do ok we're

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.340 
so let's look at what we can do ok we're
going<00:05:15.850> to<00:05:15.940> go<00:05:16.030> to<00:05:16.060> loop<00:05:16.360> slice<00:05:16.660> and<00:05:16.960> we're<00:05:17.260> just

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:23.059 
to this point we're going to add our

00:06:23.059 --> 00:06:26.739 
to this point we're going to add our
loop<00:06:23.479> slice<00:06:23.830> when<00:06:24.830> it's<00:06:24.979> flat<00:06:25.189> and<00:06:25.569> drag<00:06:26.569> it

00:06:26.739 --> 00:06:26.749 
loop slice when it's flat and drag it

00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:35.379 
loop slice when it's flat and drag it
out<00:06:26.899> to<00:06:30.610> be<00:06:31.610> seen<00:06:31.819> and<00:06:32.349> what<00:06:33.349> loop<00:06:33.770> that<00:06:34.389> and

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:35.389 
out to be seen and what loop that and

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:38.100 
out to be seen and what loop that and
we'll<00:06:35.899> go<00:06:36.080> w<00:06:36.649> and<00:06:36.860> we'll<00:06:36.949> push<00:06:37.159> that<00:06:37.339> in<00:06:37.520> now

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.110 
we'll go w and we'll push that in now

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.779 
we'll go w and we'll push that in now
okay<00:06:39.110> that's<00:06:39.499> more<00:06:39.740> of<00:06:39.860> the<00:06:40.039> effect<00:06:40.430> of<00:06:40.550> what<00:06:40.759> I

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:40.789 
okay that's more of the effect of what I

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:42.610 
okay that's more of the effect of what I
was<00:06:40.969> after<00:06:41.240> okay<00:06:41.749> so<00:06:41.809> we've<00:06:41.960> got<00:06:42.080> to<00:06:42.169> add<00:06:42.289> two

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:42.620 
was after okay so we've got to add two

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.730 
was after okay so we've got to add two
slices<00:06:43.189> to<00:06:43.849> this<00:06:44.029> side<00:06:44.270> as<00:06:44.449> well<00:06:44.689> so<00:06:45.559> we'll

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:45.740 
slices to this side as well so we'll

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.459 
slices to this side as well so we'll
loop<00:06:45.949> that<00:06:46.279> will<00:06:46.599> go<00:06:47.599> loop<00:06:47.809> slice<00:06:48.080> will<00:06:48.319> just

00:06:48.459 --> 00:06:48.469 
loop that will go loop slice will just

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:50.619 
loop that will go loop slice will just
change<00:06:48.620> our<00:06:48.800> quantity<00:06:49.309> 22<00:06:49.699> yeah<00:06:50.029> clicking<00:06:50.539> our

00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:50.629 
change our quantity 22 yeah clicking our

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:53.980 
change our quantity 22 yeah clicking our
viewport<00:06:51.080> or<00:06:51.800> just<00:06:52.129> drag<00:06:52.490> them<00:06:52.699> out<00:06:52.939> we<00:06:53.719> want

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:53.990 
viewport or just drag them out we want

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.769 
viewport or just drag them out we want
to<00:06:54.229> want<00:06:54.589> that<00:06:54.740> one<00:06:54.949> at<00:06:55.039> about<00:06:55.129> 94<00:06:55.999> whatever

00:06:56.769 --> 00:06:56.779 
to want that one at about 94 whatever

00:06:56.779 --> 00:07:00.129 
to want that one at about 94 whatever
slice<00:06:57.139> will<00:06:57.499> money<00:06:58.189> and<00:06:58.550> we'll<00:06:59.360> drag<00:06:59.599> the<00:06:59.870> next

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:00.139 
slice will money and we'll drag the next

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:04.300 
slice will money and we'll drag the next
one<00:07:00.289> out<00:07:00.499> and<00:07:01.339> about<00:07:01.459> 85<00:07:02.770> just<00:07:03.770> like<00:07:03.889> that<00:07:04.039> so

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:04.310 
one out and about 85 just like that so

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:08.439 
one out and about 85 just like that so
we'll<00:07:04.490> loop<00:07:04.729> that<00:07:05.229> W<00:07:06.969> and<00:07:07.969> we'll<00:07:08.089> push<00:07:08.270> that

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:08.449 
we'll loop that W and we'll push that

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:11.879 
we'll loop that W and we'll push that
back<00:07:08.659> in<00:07:08.839> a<00:07:08.870> bit

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:11.889 

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:14.219 

okay<00:07:12.699> so<00:07:13.300> now<00:07:13.419> we<00:07:13.479> can<00:07:13.689> see<00:07:13.930> that<00:07:14.110> we've

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:14.229 
okay so now we can see that we've

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:16.770 
okay so now we can see that we've
created<00:07:14.499> that<00:07:15.009> and<00:07:15.249> that<00:07:15.639> ok<00:07:16.090> so<00:07:16.150> now<00:07:16.509> loop

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:16.780 
created that and that ok so now loop

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:21.959 
created that and that ok so now loop
that<00:07:18.960> be<00:07:19.960> for<00:07:20.199> the<00:07:20.259> bevel<00:07:20.560> key<00:07:20.740> make<00:07:21.490> sure<00:07:21.729> that

00:07:21.959 --> 00:07:21.969 
that be for the bevel key make sure that

00:07:21.969 --> 00:07:23.850 
that be for the bevel key make sure that
group<00:07:22.300> polygon<00:07:22.810> is<00:07:22.960> switched<00:07:23.259> off<00:07:23.499> we'll<00:07:23.830> go

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:23.860 
group polygon is switched off we'll go

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.629 
group polygon is switched off we'll go
to<00:07:23.979> our<00:07:24.159> model<00:07:24.370> via<00:07:24.669> now<00:07:24.909> will<00:07:25.689> click<00:07:25.990> on<00:07:26.020> there

00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639 
to our model via now will click on there

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:30.269 
to our model via now will click on there
so<00:07:27.639> we'll<00:07:27.789> drag<00:07:28.090> that<00:07:28.300> in<00:07:28.449> a<00:07:28.539> little<00:07:28.659> bit<00:07:29.279> just

00:07:30.269 --> 00:07:30.279 
so we'll drag that in a little bit just

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:32.850 
so we'll drag that in a little bit just
just<00:07:30.759> a<00:07:30.819> little<00:07:30.999> bit<00:07:31.090> like<00:07:31.449> that<00:07:31.719> will<00:07:32.560> press

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:32.860 
just a little bit like that will press

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.559 
just a little bit like that will press
the<00:07:32.939> shift<00:07:33.939> be<00:07:34.560> and<00:07:35.969> we're<00:07:36.969> going<00:07:37.120> to<00:07:37.150> drag

00:07:37.559 --> 00:07:37.569 
the shift be and we're going to drag

00:07:37.569 --> 00:07:43.200 
the shift be and we're going to drag
that<00:07:37.599> out<00:07:39.240> and<00:07:40.240> we'll<00:07:40.599> scale<00:07:40.960> that<00:07:41.289> in<00:07:42.210> so

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:43.210 
that out and we'll scale that in so

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.869 
that out and we'll scale that in so
let's<00:07:43.419> go<00:07:43.569> to<00:07:43.629> our<00:07:43.749> side<00:07:44.229> view<00:07:44.639> because<00:07:45.639> we

00:07:45.869 --> 00:07:45.879 
let's go to our side view because we

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:48.899 
let's go to our side view because we
don't<00:07:46.090> want<00:07:46.210> to<00:07:46.379> mess<00:07:47.379> it<00:07:47.409> up<00:07:47.650> so<00:07:48.580> we'll<00:07:48.699> drag

00:07:48.899 --> 00:07:48.909 
don't want to mess it up so we'll drag

00:07:48.909 --> 00:07:50.490 
don't want to mess it up so we'll drag
that<00:07:49.120> out<00:07:49.180> a<00:07:49.389> little<00:07:49.569> bit<00:07:49.810> and<00:07:50.050> we'll<00:07:50.349> go

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:50.500 
that out a little bit and we'll go

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.800 
that out a little bit and we'll go
Schuft<00:07:50.919> be<00:07:51.310> again<00:07:51.789> and<00:07:52.060> we'll<00:07:52.270> just<00:07:52.479> scale

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:52.810 
Schuft be again and we'll just scale

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:56.390 
Schuft be again and we'll just scale
that<00:07:53.020> in<00:07:53.169> just<00:07:53.379> to<00:07:53.590> hold<00:07:53.800> the<00:07:54.009> shape<00:07:54.219> and

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 
that in just to hold the shape and

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:01.350 
that in just to hold the shape and
spacebar<00:07:58.409> so<00:07:59.409> now<00:07:59.650> when<00:08:00.550> we<00:08:00.639> look<00:08:00.669> at<00:08:00.939> it<00:08:01.090> we've

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:01.360 
spacebar so now when we look at it we've

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.920 
spacebar so now when we look at it we've
got<00:08:01.389> our<00:08:02.580> look<00:08:03.580> of<00:08:03.789> what<00:08:04.060> we<00:08:04.240> were<00:08:04.389> after<00:08:04.539> now

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:04.930 
got our look of what we were after now

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:06.779 
got our look of what we were after now
we'll<00:08:05.229> fix<00:08:05.439> it<00:08:05.589> up<00:08:05.770> and<00:08:05.979> where<00:08:06.159> I<00:08:06.189> will<00:08:06.580> add

00:08:06.779 --> 00:08:06.789 
we'll fix it up and where I will add

00:08:06.789 --> 00:08:09.839 
we'll fix it up and where I will add
some<00:08:07.229> weight<00:08:08.229> or<00:08:08.469> some<00:08:08.650> extra<00:08:09.009> slices<00:08:09.279> to<00:08:09.669> hold

00:08:09.839 --> 00:08:09.849 
some weight or some extra slices to hold

00:08:09.849 --> 00:08:12.209 
some weight or some extra slices to hold
the<00:08:10.029> shape<00:08:10.210> even<00:08:10.449> better<00:08:10.749> but<00:08:11.529> that's<00:08:11.830> a<00:08:11.949> good

00:08:12.209 --> 00:08:12.219 
the shape even better but that's a good

00:08:12.219 --> 00:08:15.719 
the shape even better but that's a good
start<00:08:12.580> to<00:08:12.849> what<00:08:13.089> we<00:08:13.240> after
