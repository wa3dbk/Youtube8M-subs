 kart 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.450
 ak-103 is quite an exotic machine and 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.520
 so when seeing all the available modules 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.860
 many may simply run up their eyes 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.360
 but still we will give you some very 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.340
 important and practical advice on how to 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.170
 correct to say your clothes 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.180
 automatic to maximize 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.520
 control returns and be useful 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.810
 the team well for myself 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.580
 first of all it is best to set 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.620
 assault handle bipod 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.840
 she has the most effective 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.090
 figure in where among the modules do not tseve 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.160
 further in effectiveness go assault 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.350
 handle and lightweight handle 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.290
 accordingly, everything is enough on the trunk 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.520
 just recommend installing 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.160
 flame arrester but do not forget about 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.830
 grenade launcher is sometimes very useful 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:14.160
 but as for the sights here to taste and 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:16.260
 color mates no but still the greatest 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.489
 Popular in the game has a sight 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.310
 arts tube 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.380
 let's summarize at ak-103 we have the most 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.900
 high damage and no assault rifles 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.760
 bought for warbax machine has 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.740
 standard rate of fire 600 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.960
 shots per minute has the ability 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.970
 installation of various modules 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.710
 of its shortcomings it is worth noting only 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.020
 high returns which is easy 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.200
 compensated by the available modules a 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.490
 also the fact that he is in the category 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.620
 rare from hence open it 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.660
 once it does not work it is expensive and 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.010
 the cost of repair therefore too 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.010
 pretty expensive 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.690
 well and on it all the guide while 103 approached 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.090
