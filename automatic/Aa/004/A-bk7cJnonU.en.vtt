00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
a mold yeah you put the mold in position

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.810 
a mold yeah you put the mold in position
then<00:00:25.330> I<00:00:25.450> jump<00:00:25.750> inside<00:00:26.050> the<00:00:26.230> mold<00:00:26.439> yeah<00:00:26.860> and

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
then I jump inside the mold yeah and

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.179 
then I jump inside the mold yeah and
then<00:00:28.029> dare<00:00:28.599> to<00:00:28.720> displace<00:00:29.140> the<00:00:29.380> concrete<00:00:30.039> in

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.189 
then dare to displace the concrete in

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.210 
then dare to displace the concrete in
the<00:00:31.180> inside<00:00:31.480> and<00:00:31.689> all<00:00:32.470> the<00:00:32.619> holes<00:00:32.800> did<00:00:33.040> have

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.220 
the inside and all the holes did have

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.700 
the inside and all the holes did have
polyurethane<00:00:34.059> but<00:00:34.360> those<00:00:34.510> when<00:00:35.290> you<00:00:35.379> strip<00:00:35.680> it

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
polyurethane but those when you strip it

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.220 
polyurethane but those when you strip it
that's<00:00:36.340> the<00:00:36.519> finished<00:00:36.760> product

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
that's the finished product

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.110 
that's the finished product
well<00:00:38.230> I<00:00:38.260> think<00:00:38.410> that's<00:00:38.590> focused<00:00:38.949> what's<00:00:39.790> the

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
well I think that's focused what's the

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.060 
well I think that's focused what's the
color<00:00:40.390> did<00:00:40.570> you<00:00:40.660> put<00:00:40.839> stuff<00:00:41.470> into<00:00:41.650> it<00:00:41.739> it's<00:00:41.890> a

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
color did you put stuff into it it's a

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.500 
color did you put stuff into it it's a
red<00:00:42.280> oxide<00:00:42.610> you<00:00:42.879> mix<00:00:43.089> it<00:00:43.210> in<00:00:43.300> with<00:00:43.390> the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
red oxide you mix it in with the

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.770 
red oxide you mix it in with the
concrete<00:00:43.809> okay<00:00:44.530> and<00:00:44.970> reinforced<00:00:45.970> yes<00:00:46.570> it's

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
concrete okay and reinforced yes it's

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.150 
concrete okay and reinforced yes it's
got<00:00:46.900> bird<00:00:47.379> wire<00:00:47.620> all<00:00:47.860> through<00:00:48.070> there
