there's two
like<00:02:43.739> I<00:02:43.769> said<00:02:43.950> this<00:02:44.130> works<00:02:44.370> with<00:02:44.489> the<00:02:44.610> MGP<00:02:44.910> as

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
like I said this works with the MGP as

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.120 
like I said this works with the MGP as
well<00:02:45.390> and<00:02:45.630> then<00:02:46.319> you<00:02:46.349> just<00:02:46.530> want<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:46.709> screw<00:02:47.099> on

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
well and then you just want to screw on

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.660 
well and then you just want to screw on
the<00:02:47.340> nuts<00:02:48.030> just<00:02:48.209> a<00:02:48.420> little<00:02:48.660> bit<00:02:49.519> like<00:02:50.519> that

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
the nuts just a little bit like that

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.240 
the nuts just a little bit like that
just<00:02:50.910> they<00:02:51.090> hold<00:02:51.329> it<00:02:51.480> in<00:02:51.630> place<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:52.590> this

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
just they hold it in place and this

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.250 
just they hold it in place and this
one's<00:02:53.549> a<00:02:53.730> bit<00:02:53.910> rusty<00:02:54.390> I<00:02:54.420> may<00:02:54.600> need<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:54.930> I<00:02:54.959> get<00:02:55.230> a

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
one's a bit rusty I may need to I get a

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.660 
one's a bit rusty I may need to I get a
new<00:02:55.440> one

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.300 

there<00:02:59.670> we<00:02:59.790> go<00:03:00.410> you<00:03:01.410> need<00:03:01.560> to<00:03:01.620> tighten<00:03:01.980> them<00:03:02.190> all

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310

back<00:03:02.549> up<00:03:03.170> so<00:03:04.170> that<00:03:04.260> means<00:03:04.440> getting<00:03:04.650> this<00:03:04.859> tool

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
back up so that means getting this tool

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.240 
back up so that means getting this tool
here<00:03:05.850> they're<00:03:06.120> like<00:03:06.299> weird<00:03:06.540> spanner<00:03:07.139> thingy

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:19.880 

and<00:03:11.250> then<00:03:11.489> tighten<00:03:11.910> it<00:03:12.000> up

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.970 

you

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.160 

and<00:03:24.980> there<00:03:25.219> we<00:03:25.310> go<00:03:25.480> then<00:03:26.480> the<00:03:26.719> break<00:03:26.930> should

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
and there we go then the break should

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.559 
and there we go then the break should
not<00:03:27.379> move<00:03:27.560> from<00:03:27.829> side<00:03:28.099> to<00:03:28.129> side<00:03:28.489> like<00:03:28.819> it<00:03:29.480> is

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
not move from side to side like it is

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:30.849 
not move from side to side like it is
now<00:03:29.780> but<00:03:29.810> that<00:03:30.230> means<00:03:30.379> you<00:03:30.439> like<00:03:30.560> to<00:03:30.680> just

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
now but that means you like to just

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:33.039 
now but that means you like to just
heighten<00:03:31.250> it<00:03:31.540> because<00:03:32.540> you<00:03:32.659> shouldn't<00:03:32.900> he

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
heighten it because you shouldn't he

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.539 
heighten it because you shouldn't he
shouldn't<00:03:33.409> move<00:03:33.500> so<00:03:33.890> it<00:03:33.950> shouldn't<00:03:34.219> hit<00:03:34.459> the

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
shouldn't move so it shouldn't hit the

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:42.610 
shouldn't move so it shouldn't hit the
side<00:03:34.790> she<00:03:35.030> just<00:03:35.239> stay<00:03:35.420> in<00:03:35.510> one<00:03:35.659> place<00:03:41.500> there<00:03:42.500> we

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
side she just stay in one place there we
