00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.169
 very good people here we are in a rally 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.490
 hard because for m81 kids we're going to 

00:00:05.169 --> 00:00:08.800
 give him this pita of good here in 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.900
 black ops 2 and well the truth is that 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.570
 you wanted like always here to take 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.779
 a few games as a copaco with this 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.550
 piece of weapon that you shit and good that 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.829
 I wanted to say good first of 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.259
 all forgive me is worth if it hits some 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:25.240
 trigger and such is not by the render not by 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.519
 the computer but by the capturing or 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.669
 I do not know what's wrong, I think it's a 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:32.739
 tad askew or does not make me much 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.870
 case and such but I think it's a 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.910
 little bit tilted and then so good 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.949
 excuse that good then the next one 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.989
 restart a little pc or something 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:43.870
 because I already tell you that I do not understand why 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:46.000
 what but good are things that happen here 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.100
 from the managers and the whole story 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.410
 and the endorsements the truth that we were 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.809
 playing and good because yesterday was impossible 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.660
 that is, I tried to get some games 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.550
 already exits something vague and the impossible 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.160
 because I tell you, be it, she was a 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.800
 madness as always is not a plague this 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.199
 from the campers and such but good 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.159
 these simple kids or a method 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:11.049
 infallible 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:13.579
 to be pissed choose to turn off the console 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:16.299
 he knows he 's crazy he fell down 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:16.299
 tips that you shit 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.140
 this this event is like 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.909
 example when today is Monday and you do not 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.609
 You want to know what Monday is, 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.140
 that made the woman is foolish not 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:29.689
 but me when maybe he was in 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.659
 class on Monday or Tuesday or whatever 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:35.060
 and such I say no no if for example today the 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.039
 Monday I say what I already say on Tuesday and the 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.810
 people no no it's not that it 's Monday and I say 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.329
 that not that it is not Tuesday already 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.280
 this is already finished it has already happened 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:45.829
 the day is almost all done 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.750
 no good is nonsense that is something 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.310
 psychological you're going to say but to 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.739
 see is going to divert your like these from 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.319
 the head of such I do not know what but but if 

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:56.420
 I used it a lot of times and the 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:58.219
 true that it worked for me or I was cogía 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.500
 On Mondays you think big Tuesday on Tuesdays 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:04.429
 how about that yes Sunday was Sunday or 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.979

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.239
 top day of power so pitchers are 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.780

 you then like I have 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.209
 there the bug since I feel like it 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.550
 to understand what it means to say that 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.410
 look at this bird lends itself that goes to 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.750

 said nothing had been started started 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.160
 It's worth it because I said that it 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.950
 they would take ten casualties or eleven or whatever 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.500
 and for good of the pce pim pam pim pam I say 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.750

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.470

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.470
 it's really cool 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:24.780
 it has not been a killing of texas you know 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:28.320
 but but if it's okay, besides, right there 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:31.620
 hurrying people there is a little bit of a sit-down 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.960
 you know 60 30 stayed but I already tell you that 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.240
 cool and good then nothing streak 15 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.640
 kids what I'm going to do also for 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.440
 playing with you is the best 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.360
 catch some warfare water there's no 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.730
 player will play with you 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.090
 I started 4 and also what I will do is play 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.880
 to whites 2 in the 360 ​​is worth because they take 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.940
 those people because the typical thing already the play 3 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.500
 and all the water does not and all that does not 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.140
 Worry that I'll see to see how 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.240
 I do but good for now that day if 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.100
 I can play with you and throwing some 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.020
 departures there is something paco that the truth 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.910
 that he missed him and good lately 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.280
 The truth is that you do not tell me anything for 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.990
 comments that I play in you 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.750
 Hector is history but good of all 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:15.330
 ways to me I feel like and well then 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.250
 I would always like to make managers 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.709
 there at the top of power and play with 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.540
 you but good now how they start 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.670
 the classes there are people with exams all 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.410
 the story and two the move as well 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.260
 you want what good, well, you have to 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.310
 leave them 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:33.130
 because what they catch is also normal 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.470
 have to be calm and all the 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.900
 story but good because nothing happens or 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.700
 be me if there are people there are people to play 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.310
 and if not then nothing happens here in a streak 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.560
 of 20 and what a bad luck that ends the 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.600
 departure but let's have very very good 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.120
 paints because right here goes more or less 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.870
 throw the whatsapp but still 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.610
 Well, 26 streak of 20 is very good 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.590
 this game has been very exciting 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.810
 I also liked a lot chachi 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.390
 piruli the procu mediatrade games more 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.920
 powerful nothing happens but it 's me 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:06.750
 like a lot with a good run 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.750
 so I do not expect anything to happen this week
