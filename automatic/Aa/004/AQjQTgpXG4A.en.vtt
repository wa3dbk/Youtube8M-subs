00:00:27.701 --> 00:00:29.701
The road is long...

00:00:31.602 --> 00:00:33.602
...I walk it all

00:00:34.946 --> 00:00:36.946
The mountains high

00:00:36.618 --> 00:00:38.618
I will

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.560
Never fall

00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.958
I'll make it home-

00:00:45.116 --> 00:00:47.116
Just wait for me...

00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:50.414
And we will live

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.320
For eternity

00:00:54.497 --> 00:00:56.497
However strong, However High

00:00:58.259 --> 00:01:00.259
Whatever distance may divide

00:01:01.347 --> 00:01:03.347
However strong, However high

00:01:05.225 --> 00:01:07.225
However long, we will survive

00:01:14.652 --> 00:01:16.652
It stays the same

00:01:17.717 --> 00:01:19.717
There's never change...

00:01:21.177 --> 00:01:23.177
I'll wait for you until time is through

00:01:27.725 --> 00:01:29.725
This all seems different now...

00:01:29.908 --> 00:01:31.908
...more colorful

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:35.739
However strong, However high

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.040
Whatever distance may divide...

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:42.870
However strong, However high

00:01:43.282 --> 00:01:45.280
However long we will survive

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.920
What does it take...

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.790
...for you to see?

00:02:19.134 --> 00:02:21.130
The road will lead you...

00:02:20.945 --> 00:02:22.940
..right on back to me!

00:02:25.241 --> 00:02:27.240
So find your heart,

00:02:28.492 --> 00:02:30.490
and make a guess-

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.200
Don't you worry...

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.080
I'm sure it'll be the best...

00:02:38.616 --> 00:02:40.620
However strong, However high

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.520
Whatever distance may divide

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.920
However strong, However high

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.720
Whatever distance may divide

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.540
However strong, However high

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.320
However long, we will survive!

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:07.110
