00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:12.100
 well the part that corresponds and the 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.959
 hen we are going to see them or not with shades 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.080
 reddish so for the crest and others 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:18.789
 parts but you were exactly the 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.130
 red color you want to use if you paint a 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:22.930
 hen I 'm going to use ones that I have 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.970
 there that is red carmine and mixed a 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.300
 little bit with the red cadmium so that 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.240
 give a color a little more more complete 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.560
 Well, it has a lot of yellow but 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.120
 important that I can use it 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.220
 You can use it like it's like more 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.440
 property I'm using those from here 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.399
 above 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.399
 in this part 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.740
 it's a little soft it's not too 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.650
 intense 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.540
 and I'm going down to complete here in 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.030
 is the top of the head of 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.820
 this hen 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.970
 so let's see if I can take what 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.040
 I was 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.540
 because here it really ends and here 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.090
 everything that is here I have to clean the 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:06.170
 brush to get the color we are going to 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.149
 remove a little bit exactly there and 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.479
 then 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:16.909
 I try to get it down here but it's almost 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.909
 with the color a bit more dry more washed 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.610
 good anyway when you paint 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.850
 good in the field if you go to 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.310
 paint outside or in the studio if it is 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.110
 has taken a picture that is the case of mine 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.440
 obviously he will do it with more time and 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:37.820
 you can go calculating the amount of color 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:40.280
 with more security with more patience for 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.590
 see if you can mix other colors or not 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.450
 and almost always many are used 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.410
 colors I am using the red carmine and 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.270
 the cadmium red so that I do not stay so 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.910
 excessively pink even though 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.680
 he tried to avoid it because almost always 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.450
 there is that tendency that as is 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.500
 painting 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.720
 a red part in the hen can be 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.550
 that is very very pink 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.509
 then they will be measuring with one 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.399
 and another color in any case if it happens then 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.020
 the color of these colors have a 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.220
 advantage that you can wash a little bit 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:18.160
 now you can remove a little bit not much 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.750
 and then one can work with more 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.530
 quiet touch and mixing those in the 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.170
 palette 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.150
 different tones and in some cases 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.360
 until red tones up black tone for 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.060
 darken certain parts and I stayed a 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.810
 little 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:39.750
 nothing else is to come down with the color 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.730
 and especially on this side of here and 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:46.310
 then try to do everything possible 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.310
 take away a little bit more 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.540
 this achieve that part that has 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.750
 of dark part and light part this other 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.890
 from here 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.100
 I'm going with the yellow ocher 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.569
 the yellow which starts from here 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.030
 what can it be if it does not have a yellow 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.790
 ocher you can form it with coffee 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.770
 clear and yellow because we remember 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.459
 that yellow believes is precisely the 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:16.010
 clearer of the ocher family or 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.560
 of earthy colors and it's easy 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.350
 try to assemble it with a brown color 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.710
 clear plus the yellow that can be the 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.960
 same yellow cadmium 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.660
 and here beings that is rescued a little 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.640
 the color form here we mix it a 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.370
 little bit with the crest but not with this 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.510
 part I do not know what the crest will be called 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.319
 now that it is going to be that edith 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.659
 yesterday saw 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.659
 and we mix it to do a little bit more 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.160
 the rude so cut the here and 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.160
 logically it is 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:55.240
 and this other part form it just in 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.980
 that way we get that principle in principle 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.590
 part of the peak that costs a lot 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.630
 times because we do not have a dark background 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.880
 behind then we have to achieve it in 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.910
 that way 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.420
 the little boy's eye is a small 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.420
 circle 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.709
 bordered 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:21.180
 with the same fine brush 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:23.630
 and then she does not have 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.760
 does not have 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.640
 shape the eyelid to paint but 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.550
 we do something similar and here 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:34.790
 we go with the part that is softer than 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.670
 the chicken is here 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:40.650
 and we're shading it to the end 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:43.350
 well that you do it more calmly 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.940
 it has a slight shadow and has all 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.440
 the costumes everywhere then 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.070
 what I do is drag a little bit the 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:52.160
 same color that I already had 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:54.830
 until you reach this edge with that achieve 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.970
 the tone that I was looking for can be 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:00.860
 even skirt all the figurine of the 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:04.010
 head with that tone 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.160
 that I had plotted and it's going to help me a lot 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.620
 to integrate the whole figure 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.410
 perfectly 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.800
 already with that, all this part is removed 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:17.180
 of her little face and nothing else is 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:21.540
 try to soften a little here 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:25.420
 mix it with the same plumage from here and 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:29.080
 then go down with those shades 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:32.750
 and dish acid shades of yellow if you 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.580
 want you can add blue to achieve 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.370
 part of what plumage can be seen 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.020
 because here is a little more bulging 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.300
 in certain areas and is that there 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:44.420
 well-defined characteristics in the 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.820
 little hen that is going to see the plumage 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.230
 more to pump on one side than on the other 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.630
 we can talk about anatomy because in 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:52.850
 actually all the skin of the hen 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.410
 is covered by that pile of feathers 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:56.960
 so what we have to do is 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.310
 dark parts here what I have left 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.440
 then it 's a little blue 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:04.150
 ultramarine let's see if I can 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:06.160
 get the absolute seaman with him 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.810
 with the ned with the black to do this 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.290
 part but this is going to go a cut 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.970
 commercial 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:13.950
 Lilita explained how it was that this is 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.950
 part of the tail and almost come back
