00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.210
 Hello, how is Federico and we are going to do 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.520
 a review of how to prepare an alien bowl 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:11.750
 funes for review by juca puntocom 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:15.050
 today we are going to use alfacar mint and we are going to 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:18.190
 proceed to prepare a bowl that takes out 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.190
 the best results 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.070
 the best flavor and the best smoke first 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.510
 we mix well all the juice with the 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.790
 tobacco 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.120
 because in the game is where everyone is 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.120
 the flavors 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.370
 how can you see the parker is a flavor 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.900
 very juicy 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.270
 and this method will be useful for us 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.990
 any type of tobacco that is of the 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:47.110
 same consistency 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:51.600
 we put it well spread around 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.600
 the whole bowl I do not know if they can see well 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.820
 try not to leave pieces too 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:02.010
 big this afternoon 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:05.750
 that is as airy as possible 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.750
 we continue with the whole bowl 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.060
 do not worry about the branches those branches 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.060
 you can stay down 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.610
 and what we are going to try is to fill 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.909
 almost almost up almost complete 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.640
 the whole bolus this is a very small bowl 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:30.170
 so we're not going to worry 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.170
 for spending too much tobacco 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.390
 the good thing about this google is that it helps us 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.390
 to keep the juices 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.880
 but it can be a bit difficult to 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.880
 prepare 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:51.619
 well we can get 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.869
 we can appreciate the smell of alfacar 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.990
 spectacular mint one of the best 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:55.990
 flavors 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.580
 It can be a bit difficult with this 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:08.320
 very sticky 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.320
 let's leave this in order 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.530
 but good as you see 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.440
 we almost almost want to top it up with 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.020
 the tobacco well spread for what 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.180
 let's do is leave 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.219
 well even 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.290
 so there are no parts that burn 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:31.359
 Moreover they are not burning and 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.930
 be able to obtain the greatest amount of flavor 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.930
 and one 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:43.560
 good for this snuff you always 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.560
 you end up filling for all 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.880
 we have the parts that are needed 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.060
 everywhere 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:05.730
 we already have our coals in the 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.220
 kitchen we will be using coconut 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.690
 black 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.810
 and it is with what we have obtained better 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.810
 results 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:18.450
 I do not know if you can appreciate there 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.450
 it is almost almost 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.170
 almost to the limit a little bit more 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.650
 down nothing else 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:32.290
 we're not going to crush it much it's just 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.460
 just touching with the finger without 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.530
 smash hit 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.110
 simply so that everything is at the same 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.370
 level 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.370
 we clean a little 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.790
 as 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.200
 perfect 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.200
 to see there a little bit 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:01.150
 perfect now I wash my hands 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.150
 quickly 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.460
 once we have that ready we have left 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.890
 put the aluminum 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.750
 I recommend them whenever they use 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.220
 the thickest aluminum that can 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.350
 find 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:21.010
 but if you can not find it there's no 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:23.600
 no problem we use the normal as in 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.890
 this case that is the only thing I have left 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.890
 and we use 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:35.420
 double layer always the bright side 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:37.880
 down that exists in this case 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.720
 many people ask that because the side 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:45.370
 bright down if I know simply 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:47.750
 label or so is the tradition but 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:51.260
 it turns out that the down side is the 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:55.880
 that reflects the heat better 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:59.780
 and that can not allow it to be preserved 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:02.480
 the heat inside the bowl good what 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:05.180
 we tighten well that it is tight 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.940
 we clean and mess 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.810
 and with a stick cooking 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:14.520
 let's do the holes 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.520
 how are we going to use natural coal 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:22.070
 let me like in my case use 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.510
 medium holes not too small to try 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.750
 of 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:29.530
 to get the best amount of 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.530
 air flow 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:37.390
 also for being a volume that has only 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:39.950
 a kind of fireplace 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:43.300
 we need the air to run freely 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.300
 no obstructions 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.430
 and there we are as you can see well 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.010
 equal 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.380
 and medium holes are not going to have 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.770
 no problem and then they have left 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:59.620
 expose the coals and they are ready 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:01.000
 thank you very much and do not forget
