you can see here siphon health whenever
you<00:05:12.710> critically<00:05:13.100> hit<00:05:13.520> so<00:05:14.180> when<00:05:14.570> you

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
you critically hit so when you

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.800 
you critically hit so when you
critically<00:05:15.080> hit<00:05:15.470> a<00:05:15.650> foe<00:05:16.070> you<00:05:16.850> also<00:05:17.330> get<00:05:17.510> some

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
critically hit a foe you also get some

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.040 
critically hit a foe you also get some
health<00:05:18.850> and<00:05:19.850> it<00:05:20.060> actually<00:05:20.180> drains<00:05:20.720> quite<00:05:21.020> a

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
health and it actually drains quite a

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.600 
health and it actually drains quite a
substantial<00:05:21.230> amount<00:05:21.800> of<00:05:22.040> health<00:05:22.280> from<00:05:22.460> the

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
substantial amount of health from the

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.190 
substantial amount of health from the
enemy<00:05:22.730> as<00:05:23.060> well<00:05:23.270> so<00:05:23.540> it<00:05:23.630> keeps<00:05:23.780> you<00:05:23.990> in<00:05:24.110> the

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
enemy as well so it keeps you in the

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.100 
enemy as well so it keeps you in the
game<00:05:24.410> and<00:05:24.790> works<00:05:25.790> very<00:05:25.970> well<00:05:26.240> for<00:05:26.660> the

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
game and works very well for the

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.260 
game and works very well for the
necromancer<00:05:27.620> to<00:05:28.040> up<00:05:28.160> your<00:05:28.340> survivability<00:05:28.910> a

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
necromancer to up your survivability a

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.740 
necromancer to up your survivability a
bit<00:05:29.570> so<00:05:30.080> as<00:05:30.230> I<00:05:30.260> say<00:05:30.620> this<00:05:30.950> is<00:05:31.160> a<00:05:31.190> level<00:05:32.090> 80<00:05:32.270> build

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
bit so as I say this is a level 80 build

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.800 
bit so as I say this is a level 80 build
