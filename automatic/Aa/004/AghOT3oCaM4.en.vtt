as people who can kind of understand

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.990 
as people who can kind of understand
that<00:04:04.919> they're<00:04:05.159> in<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.579> mental<00:04:05.849> health

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
that they're in the mental health

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.119 
that they're in the mental health
profession<00:04:06.150> and<00:04:06.930> they<00:04:07.440> can<00:04:07.680> teach<00:04:07.889> people

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
profession and they can teach people

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:10.939 
profession and they can teach people
individually<00:04:09.120> or<00:04:09.449> in<00:04:09.510> small<00:04:10.019> groups<00:04:10.049> to

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:10.949 
individually or in small groups to

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:13.399 
individually or in small groups to
become<00:04:11.400> healthier<00:04:11.940> than<00:04:12.329> they<00:04:12.569> are<00:04:12.599> because

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:13.409 
become healthier than they are because

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:16.460 
become healthier than they are because
there's<00:04:13.829> a<00:04:13.919> continuum<00:04:14.699> where<00:04:15.479> you<00:04:15.989> can<00:04:16.260> be

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
there's a continuum where you can be

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.099 
there's a continuum where you can be
less<00:04:16.949> than<00:04:16.979> mentally<00:04:17.609> healthy<00:04:18.030> have<00:04:18.630> symptoms

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
less than mentally healthy have symptoms

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.710 
less than mentally healthy have symptoms
and<00:04:19.560> then<00:04:20.099> improve

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
and then improve

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.020 
and then improve
mental<00:04:21.260> health<00:04:21.440> and<00:04:21.680> you<00:04:22.280> do<00:04:22.490> that<00:04:22.760> through

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
mental health and you do that through

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.780 
mental health and you do that through
putting<00:04:23.270> choice<00:04:23.630> theory<00:04:24.220> and<00:04:25.220> other<00:04:25.430> theories

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
putting choice theory and other theories

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.330 
putting choice theory and other theories
I<00:04:26.090> say<00:04:26.330> too<00:04:26.390> but<00:04:26.930> any<00:04:27.320> theory<00:04:27.740> that<00:04:27.920> can<00:04:28.130> teach

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
I say too but any theory that can teach

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.920 
I say too but any theory that can teach
you<00:04:28.550> how<00:04:28.580> to<00:04:28.730> be<00:04:28.970> mentally<00:04:29.360> healthy<00:04:29.390> and

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
you how to be mentally healthy and

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.260 
you how to be mentally healthy and
choice<00:04:30.500> there<00:04:30.710> is<00:04:30.770> one<00:04:31.010> of<00:04:31.130> those<00:04:31.190> theories<00:04:31.550> so

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
choice there is one of those theories so

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.180 
choice there is one of those theories so
I'd<00:04:32.780> like<00:04:33.020> to<00:04:33.200> take<00:04:33.380> a<00:04:33.440> few<00:04:33.680> moments<00:04:33.860> and

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
I'd like to take a few moments and

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.910 
I'd like to take a few moments and
describe<00:04:34.640> choice<00:04:34.940> theory<00:04:35.360> yeah<00:04:35.900> okay<00:04:36.350> but<00:04:36.770> you

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920 
describe choice theory yeah okay but you

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.170 
describe choice theory yeah okay but you
know<00:04:37.010> just<00:04:37.460> to<00:04:37.550> make<00:04:37.760> sure<00:04:37.790> that<00:04:38.060> I'm

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
know just to make sure that I'm

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.150 
know just to make sure that I'm
following<00:04:38.450> is<00:04:38.840> it<00:04:39.020> this<00:04:39.380> sounds<00:04:39.710> so<00:04:39.890> dangerous

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
following is it this sounds so dangerous

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.630 
following is it this sounds so dangerous
that<00:04:40.820> people<00:04:41.510> are<00:04:41.660> being<00:04:41.840> labeled<00:04:42.310> with<00:04:43.310> an

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
that people are being labeled with an

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.050

illness<00:04:44.120> that<00:04:44.540> they<00:04:44.690> don't<00:04:44.930> really<00:04:45.140> have<00:04:45.560> that

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
illness that they don't really have that

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.910 
illness that they don't really have that
really<00:04:47.060> because<00:04:47.660> we<00:04:47.870> buy<00:04:48.110> into<00:04:48.320> this<00:04:48.620> and

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920 
really because we buy into this and

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.330 
really because we buy into this and
