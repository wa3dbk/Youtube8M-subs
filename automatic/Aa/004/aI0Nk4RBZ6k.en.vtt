the best climbers and maybe the best

the best climbers and maybe the best
time<00:01:10.180> in<00:01:10.330> the<00:01:10.360> world<00:01:10.630> and<00:01:10.870> when<00:01:11.560> I've<00:01:11.710> been<00:01:11.950> in

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
time in the world and when I've been in

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.550 
time in the world and when I've been in
the<00:01:12.430> cave<00:01:12.640> the<00:01:12.820> first<00:01:13.060> time<00:01:13.300> I<00:01:13.630> realized<00:01:14.110> that

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
the cave the first time I realized that

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.120 
the cave the first time I realized that
it's<00:01:14.740> so<00:01:15.400> difficult<00:01:16.000> that<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:17.740> would<00:01:17.920> be<00:01:18.010> the

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
it's so difficult that it would be the

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.100 
it's so difficult that it would be the
perfect<00:01:18.369> combination<00:01:19.119> to<00:01:19.630> realize<00:01:19.960> this

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
perfect combination to realize this

the<00:03:11.370> hardest<00:03:11.640> thing<00:03:11.849> and<00:03:12.150> climbing<00:03:12.629> is

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
the hardest thing and climbing is

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:13.970 
the hardest thing and climbing is
wedding<00:03:12.930> yet<00:03:13.110> to<00:03:13.349> do<00:03:13.470> something<00:03:13.769> that's<00:03:13.860> never

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
wedding yet to do something that's never

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.680 
wedding yet to do something that's never
been<00:03:14.160> done<00:03:14.310> before<00:03:14.519> once<00:03:14.970> it's<00:03:15.120> done<00:03:15.300> it's

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
been done before once it's done it's

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.509 
been done before once it's done it's
much<00:03:15.900> easier<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:16.260> reach<00:03:16.560> that<00:03:16.769> because<00:03:17.400> you

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
much easier to reach that because you

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.910 
much easier to reach that because you
know<00:03:17.670> it's<00:03:17.849> off<00:03:20.930> we<00:03:21.930> wanted<00:03:22.200> to<00:03:22.290> make<00:03:22.380> a<00:03:22.500> proper

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
know it's off we wanted to make a proper

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.490 
know it's off we wanted to make a proper
freak<00:03:23.160> out<00:03:23.340> there<00:03:23.489> that<00:03:23.849> means<00:03:24.090> to<00:03:24.690> use<00:03:24.900> the

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
freak out there that means to use the

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.670 
freak out there that means to use the
rope<00:03:25.860> and<00:03:26.069> their<00:03:26.459> freedoms<00:03:26.910> and<00:03:27.090> false<00:03:27.680> case

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
rope and their freedoms and false case

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.660 
rope and their freedoms and false case
of<00:03:28.830> thought<00:03:29.160> and<00:03:29.569> to<00:03:30.569> move<00:03:30.750> up<00:03:30.989> just<00:03:31.380> on<00:03:31.620> a

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
of thought and to move up just on a

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.530 
of thought and to move up just on a
natural<00:03:32.670> structure<00:03:33.150> tool<00:03:34.880> or<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:36.120> route<00:03:36.330> to

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
natural structure tool or the route to

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.759 
natural structure tool or the route to
really<00:03:36.810> go<00:03:38.780> every<00:03:39.780> single<00:03:40.200> meter<00:03:40.440> of<00:03:40.680> the

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
really go every single meter of the

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.490 
really go every single meter of the
rough<00:03:40.980> and<00:03:41.569> there<00:03:42.569> was<00:03:42.690> a<00:03:42.720> section<00:03:43.200> of<00:03:43.290> about

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
rough and there was a section of about

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.740 
rough and there was a section of about
three<00:03:43.769> meters<00:03:44.069> that<00:03:44.280> I<00:03:44.579> wasn't<00:03:45.329> able<00:03:45.510> to

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
three meters that I wasn't able to

00:03:45.750 --> 00:04:08.030 
three meters that I wasn't able to
connect<00:04:04.790> you<00:04:05.790> shouldn't<00:04:06.120> give<00:04:06.239> up<00:04:06.360> on<00:04:06.510> that<00:04:07.040> so

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
connect you shouldn't give up on that so

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.440 
connect you shouldn't give up on that so
it's<00:04:08.190> cool<00:04:08.400> to<00:04:08.549> see<00:04:08.700> that<00:04:08.880> you're<00:04:09.090> a<00:04:09.120> human

what I chose to do was found a way
around<00:04:19.150> it<00:04:19.709> ended<00:04:20.709> up<00:04:20.799> probably<00:04:21.009> being<00:04:21.220> like

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
around it ended up probably being like

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.790 
around it ended up probably being like
an<00:04:21.489> eight<00:04:21.639> a<00:04:21.729> plus<00:04:22.000> pitch<00:04:22.210> so<00:04:22.630> still<00:04:23.470> ended<00:04:23.710> up

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
an eight a plus pitch so still ended up

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.180 
an eight a plus pitch so still ended up
being<00:04:23.979> a<00:04:24.070> really<00:04:24.100> awesome<00:04:24.610> hard<00:04:25.270> bitch<00:04:25.539> but<00:04:26.190> it

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
being a really awesome hard bitch but it

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.920 
being a really awesome hard bitch but it
wasn't<00:04:27.520> as<00:04:27.699> spectacular<00:04:27.970> as<00:04:28.449> I<00:04:28.660> was<00:04:28.780> hoping

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
wasn't as spectacular as I was hoping

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.850 
wasn't as spectacular as I was hoping
but<00:04:30.479> in<00:04:31.479> the<00:04:31.660> end<00:04:31.690> the<00:04:32.020> real<00:04:32.199> goal<00:04:32.500> was<00:04:32.710> to

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
but in the end the real goal was to

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.129 
but in the end the real goal was to
climb<00:04:33.100> this<00:04:33.310> amazing<00:04:34.000> cave<00:04:34.240> and<00:04:34.570> it<00:04:34.840> wasn't

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
climb this amazing cave and it wasn't

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.279 
climb this amazing cave and it wasn't
necessarily<00:04:35.500> about<00:04:35.650> any<00:04:36.400> single<00:04:36.820> pitch<00:04:36.850> so<00:04:37.300> it

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:38.289 
necessarily about any single pitch so it

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:41.010 
necessarily about any single pitch so it
was<00:04:38.440> really<00:04:38.620> like<00:04:38.860> a<00:04:40.020> groundbreaking

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
was really like a groundbreaking

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.460 
was really like a groundbreaking
achievement<00:04:41.590> for<00:04:41.680> myself<00:04:42.070> and<00:04:42.340> and<00:04:43.320> climb<00:04:44.320> out

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
achievement for myself and and climb out

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.439 
achievement for myself and and climb out
the<00:04:44.500> crazy<00:04:44.889> cave<00:04:45.220> was<00:04:45.430> was<00:04:46.120> really<00:04:46.389> an

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:46.449 
the crazy cave was was really an

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:50.520 
the crazy cave was was really an
ambitious<00:04:46.870> goal<00:04:46.930> and<00:04:48.750> I<00:04:49.750> think<00:04:50.199> we're<00:04:50.349> just

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
ambitious goal and I think we're just

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.110 
ambitious goal and I think we're just
lucky<00:04:50.710> that<00:04:50.889> it<00:04:51.099> came<00:04:51.250> together<00:04:51.400> however<00:04:51.820> it

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
lucky that it came together however it

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.810 
lucky that it came together however it
is<00:04:54.690> wicked<00:04:55.690> states<00:04:55.960> may<00:04:56.289> be<00:04:56.349> the<00:04:56.560> biggest<00:04:57.009> leap

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
is wicked states may be the biggest leap

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.350 
is wicked states may be the biggest leap
on<00:04:58.060> earth<00:04:58.270> and<00:04:59.169> maybe<00:04:59.830> it's<00:05:00.070> a<00:05:00.220> record<00:05:00.849> quarter

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
on earth and maybe it's a record quarter

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.310 
on earth and maybe it's a record quarter
this<00:05:02.229> was<00:05:02.440> not<00:05:02.620> the<00:05:02.680> objective<00:05:03.310> for<00:05:04.240> us<00:05:04.449> from<00:05:05.110> a

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
this was not the objective for us from a

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.700 
this was not the objective for us from a
world<00:05:05.620> record<00:05:05.830> air<00:05:06.509> but<00:05:07.509> we<00:05:08.199> wanted<00:05:08.440> to<00:05:08.500> find

world record air but we wanted to find

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.330 
world record air but we wanted to find
