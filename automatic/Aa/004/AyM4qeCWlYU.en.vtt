00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.870
 hello, I'm javi and this is the channel 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.120
 orchard easy picking 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.820
 Onions is a very simple task and 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.670
 intuitive but it does not hurt to have in 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.350
 account a number of factors especially 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.820
 at the time of conservation of this 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.790
 way we will have onions for 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.880
 practically all the year you already know if you 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.110
 this video is interesting and useful 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.000
 I like it and share it with your 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.200
 friends in social networks if you want 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.099
 be aware of the news of the 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.099
 subscribe channel 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.170
 the collection of the onion should be 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.980
 perform when they have all their 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.180
 part was very dry so much to check 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.829
 here and all have that part was 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.360
 almost nonexistent because it's gone 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.089
 degrading as the 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.440
 time in any way I've 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:02.140
 delayed in doing the collection 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.070
 and a series of rains have fallen 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:08.930
 quite abundant that I may 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.940
 impact on the final conservation of the 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.310
 onion 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.369
 making this paragraph 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.310
 the collection as I told you of the 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.710
 onions when it does the aerial part well 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.140
 dry 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.690
 it is very intuitive very simple 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.950
 just to tear it off 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.979
 and removed from the ground 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.680
 it is not appreciated but they are quite 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.390
 humidity above all things 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.320
 even the roots 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:44.530
 the collection is taken one by one 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:47.080
 with a type the terrain is humid and 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.840
 it is very simple if you have not 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:54.190
 carried out the irrigation during the part of the 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:57.910
 probably growing this onion 7 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:00.340
 very hard terrain what can happen 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.520
 is that being very hard ground not 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:07.479
 the onion is allowed to develop at 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.850
 wide and may suffer deformations if 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.860
 you have not given it as I said 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.280
 when performing extraction 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.590
 the onion too 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.270
 it may be a bit difficult because 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.709
 the ground is too hard we 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.490
 we could help very carefully 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:26.400
 always of the Kaffirs you will call a 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:29.480
 way or another and you would have to give it to 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.300
 take out and help extract that onion 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.430
 one should make the coup 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.390
 centimeters away from the onion for 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.720
 not to damage it, we can give cuts and damage the 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.720
 fruit 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.200
 the onion is removed, we remove the 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:49.530
 more external layers we need the part 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.530
 aerial 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:56.430
 and we're going to certain heaps 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.430
 I try to do lots of 3 or 4 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.640
 so that they go dry always 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.480
 taking into account the forecast of 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:10.370
 time and the rains do not affect us at 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.010
 pounds depositing in small piles 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.349
 what we will do is allow for 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.690
 natural way using the sun as 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:21.920
 heat source 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.930
 go drying the onions and reduce the 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.700
 moisture content of the same with 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.170
 what we got that conservation 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.170
 be more durable 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.040
 we proceed 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.319
 do the collection 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.750
 and once we have all the 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.650
 onions 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.720
 harvested 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.870
 and deposited in small piles 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.460
 we will let in a few days this humidity 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.830
 has been removed 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.900
 every two or three days 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.400
 you can flip them or if you go 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:00.239
 often to the garden 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:04.319
 every day, we change her position 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:06.330
 for that is reduced in all 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.310
 onion parts 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:12.060
 a very important aspect when 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:14.910
 we have dry in the field is that 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.910
 when it comes to keeping them we can 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:20.310
 use and the best would be advice would be 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.230
 that it is best to use fruit boxes 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.370
 of these 25 kilos that are 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:28.050
 perforated on all sides allows 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.440
 air circulation between 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.440
 onions 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:36.240
 and with this will hold much more 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:39.249
 It can also be spread on the ground and 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.019
 they also endured a lot of time 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:44.529
 when it comes to preserving, you have to have 

00:04:41.019 --> 00:04:46.400
 mind that it is a ventilated place to the 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:47.960
 Once dry 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.530
 and dark 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:54.710
 and fresh agreement considering 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:57.020
 these 34 parameters we are going to get 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.539
 that the onion can hold us very much 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.340
 time I last year I chose it like this 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:03.500
 mid late September and I had 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.630
 onions in very good condition without 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.890
 explain yourself with nothing 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.890
 to May 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:17.380
 very few in relation to all but yes 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:21.400
 you consider these factors and the 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.950
 time to collect act as we have 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.600
 commented 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:28.770
 probably conservation does not have 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.770
 no problem and have
