has the composite blade it's a big a
knife<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:38.640> actually<00:00:38.790> like<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.329> quite<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.540> bit

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
knife I actually like it quite a bit

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.600 
knife I actually like it quite a bit
very<00:00:40.980> very<00:00:41.579> ergonomic<00:00:42.270> handle<00:00:43.070> it<00:00:44.070> just<00:00:44.309> fits

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
very very ergonomic handle it just fits

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.060 
very very ergonomic handle it just fits
the<00:00:44.789> hand<00:00:45.000> very<00:00:45.210> well<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:46.559> composite

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
the hand very well and that composite

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.790 
the hand very well and that composite
blade<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.640> really<00:00:47.879> cool<00:00:48.090> because<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:49.020> the

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
blade is really cool because the the

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.619 
blade is really cool because the the
spine<00:00:50.360> is<00:00:51.360> 13<00:00:52.020> c<00:00:52.260> 26<00:00:52.860> sandvik<00:00:53.370> steel<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
spine is 13 c 26 sandvik steel and the

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.470 
spine is 13 c 26 sandvik steel and the
cutting<00:00:54.930> edge<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.230> CP<00:00:55.590> md<00:00:55.920> 2<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:57.000> this<00:00:57.120> thing<00:00:57.360> is

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
cutting edge is CP md 2 so this thing is

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.340 
cutting edge is CP md 2 so this thing is
razor<00:00:58.199> sharp<00:00:58.440> i<00:00:59.719> can<00:01:00.719> pick<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:00.930> up<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.289> the

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
razor sharp i can pick that up in the

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.780 
razor sharp i can pick that up in the
camera<00:01:02.090> very<00:01:03.090> very<00:01:03.359> sharp<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:04.189> as<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.580> might

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
camera very very sharp and as you might

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.620 
camera very very sharp and as you might
see<00:01:06.090> there<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.840> has<00:01:07.020> 4<00:01:07.470> x's<00:01:07.979> on<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.310> blade

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
see there it has 4 x's on the blade

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.570 
see there it has 4 x's on the blade
which<00:01:09.630> means<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.080> this<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.770> factory

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
which means that this is a factory

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.609 
which means that this is a factory
second<00:01:12.799> well<00:01:13.799> guess<00:01:14.570> it's<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.659> factory<00:01:16.080> second

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
second well guess it's a factory second

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.240 
second well guess it's a factory second
