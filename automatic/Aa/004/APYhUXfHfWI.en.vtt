gotta<00:01:36.780> do<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.560> really<00:01:37.799> got<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.070> learn<00:01:38.220> like

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.130 
gotta do is you really got to learn like
I<00:01:38.490> think<00:01:38.909> Darryl<00:01:39.210> Strawberry<00:01:39.720> should<00:01:39.900> do<00:01:40.020> it

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
I think Darryl Strawberry should do it

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.420 
I think Darryl Strawberry should do it
next<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.560> think<00:01:40.770> he<00:01:40.860> should<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.040> know<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.250> mean

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
next I think he should you know I mean

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.800 
next I think he should you know I mean
it<00:01:41.700> should<00:01:41.850> be<00:01:41.909> like<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.119> celebrity<00:01:42.509> thing

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
it should be like a celebrity thing

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.910 
it should be like a celebrity thing
every<00:01:43.170> year<00:01:43.200> we<00:01:43.500> should<00:01:43.560> have<00:01:43.740> great

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
every year we should have great

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.950 
every year we should have great
celebrity<00:01:44.340> murders<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:45.509> know<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.659> think

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
celebrity murders you know I think

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.569 
celebrity murders you know I think
that's<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.170> good<00:01:46.259> idea<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.680> can<00:01:46.890> be<00:01:47.070> like<00:01:47.220> circus

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
that's a good idea it can be like circus

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.180 
that's a good idea it can be like circus
and<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.759> stars<00:01:48.030> yeah

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
and the stars yeah

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.310 
and the stars yeah
you<00:01:50.850> get<00:01:51.000> let's<00:01:51.210> say<00:01:51.360> Kirk<00:01:51.660> Cameron<00:01:51.900> I'm<00:01:52.170> sure

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
you get let's say Kirk Cameron I'm sure

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.980 
you get let's say Kirk Cameron I'm sure
he'd<00:01:52.500> kill<00:01:52.710> somebody<00:01:53.750> sent<00:01:54.750> him<00:01:54.870> out<00:01:54.930> there

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
he'd kill somebody sent him out there

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.410 
he'd kill somebody sent him out there
yeah<00:01:55.530> yeah<00:01:55.800> I<00:01:55.830> think<00:01:56.040> it's<00:01:56.370> it<00:01:56.490> yet<00:01:56.670> instead<00:01:57.330> of

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
yeah yeah I think it's it yet instead of

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.760 
yeah yeah I think it's it yet instead of
the<00:01:57.510> rich<00:01:57.690> and<00:01:57.780> famous<00:01:57.900> it<00:01:58.380> could<00:01:58.500> be<00:01:58.620> the

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
the rich and famous it could be the

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.680 
the rich and famous it could be the
guilt<00:01:59.010> that<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.310> murderers<00:01:59.730> you<00:01:59.940> know<00:02:00.090> what

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
guilt that the murderers you know what

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.120 
guilt that the murderers you know what
