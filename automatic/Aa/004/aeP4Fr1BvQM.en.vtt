00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
results of the clan war but to start off

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.790 
results of the clan war but to start off
I<00:00:36.750> attack<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.320> number<00:00:37.590> one<00:00:37.739> guy<00:00:37.940> fr3<00:00:38.940> Durst<00:00:39.360> I

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
I attack the number one guy fr3 Durst I

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.690 
I attack the number one guy fr3 Durst I
personally<00:00:40.800> have<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:40.980> detective<00:00:41.399> based<00:00:41.520> like

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
personally have a detective based like

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.090 
personally have a detective based like
this<00:00:41.910> but<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.270> figure<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.780> best<00:00:42.930> spot<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.829> do<00:00:44.070> it

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
this but I figure the best spot to do it

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.400 
this but I figure the best spot to do it
would<00:00:44.219> be<00:00:44.250> at<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.520> top<00:00:44.820> because<00:00:45.600> that's<00:00:46.079> only

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
would be at the top because that's only

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.619 
would be at the top because that's only
taking<00:00:46.739> on<00:00:46.829> one<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.100> Expos<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.300> King

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
taking on one of the Expos and the King

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.540

at<00:00:48.809> first<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.739> could<00:00:49.950> create<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.219> nice

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
at first and I could create a nice

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.160 
at first and I could create a nice
little<00:00:50.850> tunnel<00:00:51.149> effect<00:00:51.270> for<00:00:51.629> all<00:00:51.660> three<00:00:52.020> my
