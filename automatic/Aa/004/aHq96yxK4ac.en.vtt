00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:42.789 
and I make a funnel out of it I'm gonna
just<00:01:22.650> shape<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:22.979> into<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.369> triangular<00:01:24.119> shape

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.469 

okay<00:01:43.799> so<00:01:44.100> as<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.460> can<00:01:44.640> see<00:01:44.850> we're<00:01:45.030> filling<00:01:45.390> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.219 
okay so as you can see we're filling the
container<00:01:46.340> and<00:01:47.539> this<00:01:48.539> it<00:01:48.720> actually<00:01:48.899> makes

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
container and this it actually makes

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.039 
container and this it actually makes
more<00:01:49.440> mixture<00:01:49.860> than<00:01:50.039> the<00:01:50.130> container<00:01:50.490> can<00:01:50.580> hold

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
more mixture than the container can hold

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.410 
more mixture than the container can hold
so<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.080> get<00:01:52.320> an<00:01:52.409> extra<00:01:52.649> container<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:54.060> put<00:01:54.090> the
