trying<00:01:32.450> to<00:01:32.600> get<00:01:32.720> a<00:01:32.750> man<00:01:32.960> but<00:01:33.140> well<00:01:33.560> for<00:01:33.740> the

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
trying to get a man but well for the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.710 
trying to get a man but well for the
people<00:01:34.100> listening<00:01:34.310> and<00:01:34.730> watching<00:01:34.910> this<00:01:35.540> would

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
people listening and watching this would

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.660 
people listening and watching this would
obviously<00:01:35.780> be<00:01:36.260> a<00:01:36.440> 602<00:01:36.890> that<00:01:37.280> that<00:01:37.490> pattern

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
obviously be a 602 that that pattern

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.760 
obviously be a 602 that that pattern
there<00:01:38.030> we<00:01:38.210> are<00:01:38.300> talking<00:01:38.600> about<00:01:38.660> what<00:01:39.350> is<00:01:39.530> the

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
there we are talking about what is the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.190 
there we are talking about what is the
the<00:01:40.280> next<00:01:40.790> one<00:01:40.940> down<00:01:41.090> from<00:01:41.360> that<00:01:41.510> is<00:01:41.750> obviously

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
the next one down from that is obviously

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.460 
the next one down from that is obviously
the<00:01:42.790> 404<00:01:43.790> and<00:01:44.210> then<00:01:44.270> you<00:01:44.780> talked<00:01:45.050> about<00:01:45.290> the

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
the 404 and then you talked about the

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.410 
the 404 and then you talked about the
102<00:01:45.800> which<00:01:46.100> is<00:01:46.310> more<00:01:46.520> aggressive<00:01:46.760> words<00:01:47.210> that

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
102 which is more aggressive words that

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.540 
102 which is more aggressive words that
one<00:01:47.570> out<00:01:47.720> the<00:01:47.930> 102<00:01:48.470> is<00:01:48.710> right<00:01:49.040> behind<00:01:49.220> you

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
one out the 102 is right behind you

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.040 
one out the 102 is right behind you
right<00:01:49.940> here

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
right here

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.080 
right here
as<00:01:51.140> you<00:01:51.260> can<00:01:51.380> see<00:01:51.650> it's<00:01:52.010> our<00:01:52.220> only<00:01:52.400> directs<00:01:52.940> to

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
as you can see it's our only directs to

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.120 
as you can see it's our only directs to
a<00:01:53.180> motocross<00:01:53.570> tired<00:01:53.960> you<00:01:54.560> know<00:01:54.680> it's<00:01:54.860> kind<00:01:55.070> of

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
a motocross tired you know it's kind of

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.440 
a motocross tired you know it's kind of
shaped<00:01:55.280> like<00:01:55.460> a<00:01:55.490> paddle<00:01:55.880> I<00:01:55.910> guess<00:01:56.090> it's<00:01:56.300> got<00:01:56.420> a

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
shaped like a paddle I guess it's got a

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.820 
shaped like a paddle I guess it's got a
fin<00:01:56.750> gives<00:01:57.080> it<00:01:57.170> a<00:01:57.230> bit<00:01:57.260> of<00:01:57.380> straight<00:01:57.680> line

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
fin gives it a bit of straight line

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.860 
fin gives it a bit of straight line
stability<00:01:58.040> but<00:01:58.520> I<00:01:58.580> mean<00:01:58.790> it's<00:01:59.390> for<00:01:59.660> a<00:01:59.690> really

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
stability but I mean it's for a really

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.530 
stability but I mean it's for a really
severe<00:02:00.680> you<00:02:01.310> know<00:02:01.430> mud<00:02:01.700> sand<00:02:02.000> stuff<00:02:02.330> that<00:02:02.480> you

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
severe you know mud sand stuff that you

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.570 
severe you know mud sand stuff that you
walk<00:02:02.750> in<00:02:02.960> that<00:02:03.110> you'd<00:02:03.260> sink<00:02:03.560> in<00:02:03.710> it<00:02:03.800> so<00:02:04.040> and<00:02:04.490> you

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
walk in that you'd sink in it so and you

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.070 
walk in that you'd sink in it so and you
think<00:02:04.730> for<00:02:04.940> the<00:02:05.000> most<00:02:05.150> part<00:02:05.270> let's<00:02:05.810> put<00:02:05.960> that

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
think for the most part let's put that

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.859 
think for the most part let's put that
one<00:02:06.140> up<00:02:06.260> against<00:02:06.740> one<00:02:07.580> of<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:07.790> 402<00:02:08.270> s<00:02:08.540> here<00:02:08.840> I

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
one up against one of the 402 s here I

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.860 
one up against one of the 402 s here I
just<00:02:09.110> want<00:02:09.290> to<00:02:09.320> see<00:02:09.500> let<00:02:09.740> them<00:02:09.890> viewers<00:02:10.880> 40<00:02:11.600> for

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
just want to see let them viewers 40 for

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.750 
just want to see let them viewers 40 for
rather<00:02:12.110> let<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:12.560> viewers<00:02:12.740> see<00:02:13.130> how

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
rather let the viewers see how

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.360 
rather let the viewers see how
aggressive<00:02:14.300> that<00:02:14.480> tire<00:02:14.990> is<00:02:15.260> yeah<00:02:16.040> like<00:02:16.220> it

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
aggressive that tire is yeah like it

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.920 
aggressive that tire is yeah like it
intermediate<00:02:17.030> tire<00:02:17.240> will<00:02:17.480> have<00:02:17.630> some

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
intermediate tire will have some

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.690 
intermediate tire will have some
openness<00:02:18.380> and<00:02:18.620> some<00:02:18.800> close<00:02:19.040> together<00:02:19.250> and

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
openness and some close together and

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.120 
openness and some close together and
he'll<00:02:20.180> have<00:02:20.300> some<00:02:20.570> dimples<00:02:20.930> in<00:02:21.110> it<00:02:21.230> you<00:02:22.100> know

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
he'll have some dimples in it you know

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.710 
he'll have some dimples in it you know
because<00:02:22.430> I<00:02:22.460> hard<00:02:22.700> terrain<00:02:22.910> tire<00:02:23.210> is<00:02:23.450> actually

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
because I hard terrain tire is actually

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.350 
because I hard terrain tire is actually
made<00:02:23.840> to<00:02:23.960> grip<00:02:24.170> where<00:02:24.920> soft<00:02:25.610> rain<00:02:25.820> tires<00:02:26.090> made

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
made to grip where soft rain tires made

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.880 
made to grip where soft rain tires made
to<00:02:26.480> dig<00:02:26.690> that's<00:02:26.960> white<00:02:27.110> spaced<00:02:27.440> out<00:02:27.650> so

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
to dig that's white spaced out so

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.710 
to dig that's white spaced out so
intermediate<00:02:28.400> Tyrol<00:02:28.730> up<00:02:28.880> some<00:02:29.060> of<00:02:29.180> both<00:02:29.360> but

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
intermediate Tyrol up some of both but

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.500 
intermediate Tyrol up some of both but
you<00:02:30.410> know<00:02:30.530> it<00:02:30.710> won't<00:02:30.920> be<00:02:31.040> as<00:02:31.190> severe<00:02:31.580> as<00:02:31.640> 102<00:02:32.120> or

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
you know it won't be as severe as 102 or

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.650 
you know it won't be as severe as 102 or
you<00:02:33.500> know<00:02:33.650> as<00:02:33.920> hard<00:02:34.490> pack<00:02:34.700> is<00:02:34.880> at<00:02:35.030> 60<00:02:35.300> to<00:02:35.360> a<00:02:35.510> so

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
you know as hard pack is at 60 to a so

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.140 
you know as hard pack is at 60 to a so
but<00:02:36.650> yeah<00:02:37.010> that's<00:02:37.280> I<00:02:37.550> mean<00:02:37.850> it's<00:02:38.060> quite

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
but yeah that's I mean it's quite

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.420 
but yeah that's I mean it's quite
significant<00:02:38.870> difference<00:02:39.260> there<00:02:39.470> and<00:02:40.220> like<00:02:40.400> I

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
significant difference there and like I

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.790 
significant difference there and like I
say<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:40.730> 102<00:02:41.120> is<00:02:41.180> directional<00:02:41.810> so<00:02:42.080> you<00:02:42.680> always

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
say the 102 is directional so you always

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.610 
say the 102 is directional so you always
put<00:02:43.070> it<00:02:43.160> on<00:02:43.280> shape<00:02:43.910> so<00:02:44.180> it'll<00:02:44.660> dig<00:02:44.930> constantly

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
put it on shape so it'll dig constantly

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.130 
put it on shape so it'll dig constantly
throw<00:02:46.580> some<00:02:46.760> roost<00:02:46.970> out<00:02:47.150> there<00:02:47.360> well<00:02:48.050> you

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
throw some roost out there well you

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.500 
throw some roost out there well you
heard<00:02:48.290> it<00:02:48.440> from<00:02:48.650> Rory<00:02:49.340> O'Neil<00:02:49.550> not<00:02:50.000> only<00:02:50.300> does
