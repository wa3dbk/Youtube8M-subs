00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.070 

okay<00:00:02.010> now<00:00:02.220> let's<00:00:02.250> discuss<00:00:02.959> checkmating<00:00:03.959> the

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
okay now let's discuss checkmating the

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.259 
okay now let's discuss checkmating the
black<00:00:04.350> bean<00:00:04.650> with<00:00:05.120> basically<00:00:06.120> two<00:00:06.629> rooks<00:00:08.269> so

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
black bean with basically two rooks so

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.379 
black bean with basically two rooks so
the<00:00:09.599> concept<00:00:10.110> is<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.530> same<00:00:10.969> we're<00:00:11.969> going<00:00:12.240> to

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
the concept is the same we're going to

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.990 
the concept is the same we're going to
limit<00:00:13.250> the<00:00:14.299> squares<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.690> King<00:00:16.020> can<00:00:16.289> move<00:00:16.529> to

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
limit the squares the King can move to

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.620 
limit the squares the King can move to
we're<00:00:18.000> going<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.420> keep<00:00:18.630> reducing<00:00:20.150> this<00:00:21.150> sort

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
we're going to keep reducing this sort

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.099 
we're going to keep reducing this sort
of<00:00:21.689> this<00:00:21.900> box<00:00:22.320> where<00:00:22.650> they<00:00:22.740> can<00:00:22.949> can<00:00:23.160> move<00:00:23.340> to

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:24.109 
of this box where they can can move to

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.070 
of this box where they can can move to
driving<00:00:25.109> him<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:27.150> side<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.750> board

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
driving him to a the side of the board

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.200 
driving him to a the side of the board
and<00:00:28.320> then<00:00:29.279> we're<00:00:29.490> going<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.789> deliver

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
and then we're going to deliver

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.920 
and then we're going to deliver
checkmate<00:00:31.430> in<00:00:32.430> this<00:00:32.940> case<00:00:33.180> we<00:00:33.450> really<00:00:33.780> don't

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
checkmate in this case we really don't

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.709 
checkmate in this case we really don't
need<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.320> help<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.829> king<00:00:35.360> but<00:00:36.360> there<00:00:36.540> are

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
need the help of the king but there are

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.450 
need the help of the king but there are
a<00:00:36.780> few<00:00:37.020> special<00:00:37.530> things<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:38.100> we<00:00:38.219> need<00:00:38.399> to

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
a few special things that we need to

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.090 
a few special things that we need to
note<00:00:38.910> because<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.410> rooks<00:00:40.649> may<00:00:40.890> actually

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
note because the the rooks may actually

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.360 
note because the the rooks may actually
become<00:00:41.489> vulnerable<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:43.230> capture<00:00:43.710> or<00:00:44.190> the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
become vulnerable to to capture or the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.279 
become vulnerable to to capture or the
King<00:00:44.610> might<00:00:45.210> be<00:00:45.360> able<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.570> capture<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.079> rook

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
King might be able to capture the rook

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.040 
King might be able to capture the rook
so<00:00:46.500> we<00:00:46.710> may<00:00:46.890> have<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.219> do<00:00:47.879> if<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.180> move<00:00:48.450> so<00:00:48.870> the

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
so we may have to do if you move so the

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.170 
so we may have to do if you move so the
king<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.739> black<00:00:49.950> king<00:00:50.190> doesn't<00:00:50.399> capture<00:00:50.850> the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
king the black king doesn't capture the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.799 
king the black king doesn't capture the
rooks<00:00:51.420> but<00:00:52.199> we're<00:00:52.350> going<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.530> do<00:00:52.649> start<00:00:53.010> out<00:00:53.190> by

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
rooks but we're going to do start out by

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.889 
rooks but we're going to do start out by
limiting<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.550> squares<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.969> black<00:00:57.420> king<00:00:57.690> can

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
limiting the squares the black king can

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.709 
limiting the squares the black king can
go<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.550> so<00:00:59.550> just<00:00:59.760> like<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.910> last<00:01:00.210> lecture<00:01:00.600> i'm

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
go to so just like a last lecture i'm

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.950 
go to so just like a last lecture i'm
just<00:01:00.899> going<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.079> go<00:01:01.260> through<00:01:01.770> these<00:01:01.920> moves<00:01:02.960> so

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
just going to go through these moves so

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.020 
just going to go through these moves so
first<00:01:04.739> I'm<00:01:04.920> just<00:01:04.949> going<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.220> move<00:01:05.400> this<00:01:05.610> this

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
first I'm just going to move this this

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.609 
first I'm just going to move this this

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
woke up I could actually chose the other

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.899 
woke up I could actually chose the other
book<00:01:07.860> but<00:01:08.850> here<00:01:09.119> i<00:01:09.330> move<00:01:09.810> my<00:01:09.840> rook<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.530> e3<00:01:11.310> and

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
book but here i move my rook to e3 and

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.899 
book but here i move my rook to e3 and
notice<00:01:12.840> with<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.200> green<00:01:14.040> arrows<00:01:14.400> I'm<00:01:14.729> now

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
notice with the green arrows I'm now

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.660 
notice with the green arrows I'm now
limited<00:01:16.340> the<00:01:17.340> space<00:01:17.700> where<00:01:17.970> they<00:01:18.119> can<00:01:18.290> move<00:01:19.290> to

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
limited the space where they can move to

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.190 
limited the space where they can move to
and<00:01:20.670> notice<00:01:21.000> now<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.210> King<00:01:21.540> cannot<00:01:21.810> move<00:01:21.990> to

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
and notice now the King cannot move to

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.410 
and notice now the King cannot move to
any<00:01:22.350> one<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.530> these<00:01:22.710> squares<00:01:23.520> highlighted<00:01:24.270> in

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
any one of these squares highlighted in

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.100 
any one of these squares highlighted in
red<00:01:25.189> ok<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:26.909> what<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.360> Kings<00:01:27.570> going<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:27.930> want

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
red ok so what the Kings going to want

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.899 
red ok so what the Kings going to want
to<00:01:28.170> do<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.590> going<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.860> want<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.159> try<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.490> run

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
to do is going to want to try to run

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.719 
to do is going to want to try to run
over<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.509> where<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.590> rooks<00:01:31.829> are<00:01:32.009> can<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.670> can

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
over to where the rooks are can so can

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.870 
over to where the rooks are can so can
maybe<00:01:33.060> try<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.420> capture<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.350> rooks<00:01:34.820> ok<00:01:35.820> so

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
maybe try to capture the rooks ok so

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.149 
maybe try to capture the rooks ok so
they<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.930> black<00:01:37.079> king<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.500> going<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.890> run

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
they so the black king is going to run

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.770 
they so the black king is going to run
to<00:01:38.340> e4<00:01:39.110> ok<00:01:40.110> but<00:01:41.070> we<00:01:41.790> can<00:01:42.000> still<00:01:42.030> make<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.540> Box

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
to e4 ok but we can still make the Box

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.920 
to e4 ok but we can still make the Box
smaller<00:01:43.610> because<00:01:44.610> they<00:01:44.909> can't<00:01:45.420> capture<00:01:45.689> the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
smaller because they can't capture the

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.200 
smaller because they can't capture the
rooks<00:01:46.140> yet<00:01:46.350> so<00:01:47.310> it's<00:01:47.549> going<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.729> come<00:01:47.850> up<00:01:48.030> and

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
rooks yet so it's going to come up and

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.870 
rooks yet so it's going to come up and
notice<00:01:48.600> what<00:01:48.829> I've<00:01:49.829> done<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.159> I've<00:01:50.250> drawn<00:01:50.579> I

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
notice what I've done is I've drawn I

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.210 
notice what I've done is I've drawn I
move<00:01:51.270> this<00:01:51.450> rook<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:52.110> h4

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
move this rook to h4

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.930 
move this rook to h4
the<00:01:53.370> one<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.640> was<00:01:53.760> on<00:01:53.850> h1<00:01:54.300> up<00:01:54.510> to<00:01:54.660> h4<00:01:55.940> and

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
the one that was on h1 up to h4 and

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.030 
the one that was on h1 up to h4 and
notice<00:01:57.360> I've<00:01:57.690> drawn<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:57.990> green<00:01:58.290> arrows<00:01:58.590> thee

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
notice I've drawn a green arrows thee

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.210 
notice I've drawn a green arrows thee
with<00:01:59.850> all<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.390> squares<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.110> other<00:02:01.530> rooks

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
with all the squares of the other rooks

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.510 
with all the squares of the other rooks
control<00:02:02.940> or<00:02:03.330> maybe<00:02:04.140> we<00:02:04.290> say<00:02:04.500> where<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.830> rooks

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
control or maybe we say where the rooks

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.550 
control or maybe we say where the rooks
could<00:02:05.790> capture<00:02:06.150> the<00:02:06.510> enemy<00:02:06.690> King<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.350> since

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
could capture the enemy King and since

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.590 
could capture the enemy King and since
the<00:02:07.680> King<00:02:07.950> can<00:02:08.220> beat<00:02:08.460> any<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.180> those<00:02:09.270> squares

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
the King can beat any of those squares

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.950 
the King can beat any of those squares
my<00:02:09.780> rule<00:02:10.080> ask<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.310> move<00:02:11.520> but<00:02:12.210> can't<00:02:12.480> move<00:02:12.720> to

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
my rule ask the move but can't move to

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.350 
my rule ask the move but can't move to
those<00:02:13.110> squares<00:02:13.500> so<00:02:14.310> notice<00:02:14.580> I<00:02:14.670> can't<00:02:14.910> move<00:02:15.090> to

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
those squares so notice I can't move to

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.350 
those squares so notice I can't move to
name<00:02:15.540> this<00:02:15.690> words<00:02:15.990> highlighted<00:02:16.320> in<00:02:16.890> red<00:02:17.360> so

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
name this words highlighted in red so

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.660 
name this words highlighted in red so
notice<00:02:18.630> how<00:02:18.720> we've<00:02:18.900> made<00:02:19.170> a<00:02:19.200> box<00:02:19.620> a<00:02:19.950> little<00:02:20.160> bit

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
notice how we've made a box a little bit

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.750 
notice how we've made a box a little bit
smaller<00:02:21.030> one<00:02:21.450> sort<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:21.900> one<00:02:22.140> row<00:02:22.380> at<00:02:22.410> a<00:02:22.650> time

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
smaller one sort of one row at a time

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.160 
smaller one sort of one row at a time
but<00:02:23.760> once<00:02:23.910> again<00:02:24.120> make<00:02:24.270> things<00:02:24.300> going<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:24.990> run

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
but once again make things going to run

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.720 
but once again make things going to run
towards<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:25.770> ropes<00:02:26.070> because<00:02:26.220> it's<00:02:26.550> going<00:02:26.670> to

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
towards the ropes because it's going to

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.240 
towards the ropes because it's going to
try<00:02:26.970> to<00:02:27.030> capture<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.690> ropes<00:02:28.010> so<00:02:29.010> it's<00:02:29.130> going

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
try to capture the ropes so it's going

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.580 
try to capture the ropes so it's going
to<00:02:29.340> run<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:29.760> f5<00:02:31.700> now<00:02:32.700> if<00:02:32.850> we<00:02:33.000> were<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.510> move<00:02:33.810> now

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
to run to f5 now if we were to move now

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.160 
to run to f5 now if we were to move now
here<00:02:35.010> just<00:02:35.250> continue<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.880> pattern<00:02:36.060> of<00:02:36.390> sort

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
here just continue the pattern of sort

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.580 
here just continue the pattern of sort
of<00:02:37.230> alternating<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.070> rooks<00:02:38.430> down<00:02:39.590> the

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
of alternating the rooks down the

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.460 
of alternating the rooks down the
rookwood<00:02:41.370> get<00:02:41.700> captured<00:02:41.970> so<00:02:42.900> we<00:02:43.050> were<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.350> move

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
rookwood get captured so we were to move

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.750 
rookwood get captured so we were to move
this<00:02:43.680> rook<00:02:44.010> on<00:02:44.520> g3<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.720> g5<00:02:46.310> they<00:02:47.310> keep<00:02:47.550> it

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
this rook on g3 to g5 they keep it

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.960 
this rook on g3 to g5 they keep it
simply<00:02:48.180> dis<00:02:48.360> capture<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.050> rook<00:02:49.700> so<00:02:50.700> what<00:02:50.850> we

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
simply dis capture the rook so what we

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.440 
simply dis capture the rook so what we
want<00:02:51.209> to<00:02:51.270> do<00:02:51.540> is<00:02:52.220> we<00:02:53.220> want<00:02:53.250> we're<00:02:54.209> going<00:02:54.390> to

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
want to do is we want we're going to

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.510 
want to do is we want we're going to
basically<00:02:54.810> switch<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.590> sides<00:02:55.860> of<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:56.250> rope

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
basically switch the sides of the rope

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.130 
basically switch the sides of the rope
so<00:02:56.760> when<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:56.970> King<00:02:57.209> gets<00:02:57.420> over<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.900> rooks

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
so when the King gets over to the rooks

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.560 
so when the King gets over to the rooks
we're<00:02:58.980> just<00:02:59.100> going<00:02:59.310> to<00:02:59.370> move<00:02:59.580> the<00:02:59.820> rooks<00:03:00.090> over

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
we're just going to move the rooks over

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.080 
we're just going to move the rooks over
to<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:00.930> other<00:03:01.050> side<00:03:01.440> as<00:03:02.340> it's<00:03:02.640> going<00:03:02.790> to<00:03:02.880> take

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
to the other side as it's going to take

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.880 
to the other side as it's going to take
the<00:03:03.269> King<00:03:03.480> a<00:03:03.600> few<00:03:03.870> moves<00:03:04.110> to<00:03:04.410> get<00:03:04.560> over<00:03:04.739> to<00:03:04.860> that

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
the King a few moves to get over to that

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.420 
the King a few moves to get over to that
side<00:03:05.070> and<00:03:05.670> there<00:03:06.269> in<00:03:06.360> that<00:03:06.480> time<00:03:06.720> we<00:03:07.650> can<00:03:07.680> be

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
side and there in that time we can be

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.100 
side and there in that time we can be
moving<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.910> King<00:03:09.150> back<00:03:09.420> this<00:03:09.750> is<00:03:09.900> how<00:03:10.050> it

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
moving the King back this is how it

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.720 
moving the King back this is how it
works<00:03:10.290> they<00:03:10.590> move<00:03:10.800> the<00:03:10.950> King<00:03:11.160> back<00:03:11.400> if<00:03:11.610> you

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
works they move the King back if you

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.850 
works they move the King back if you
rose<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.780> King<00:03:13.050> gets<00:03:13.260> over<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:13.650> rooks

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
rose the King gets over to the rooks

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.290 
rose the King gets over to the rooks
Anthony<00:03:14.310> other<00:03:14.459> works<00:03:14.640> over<00:03:14.910> then<00:03:15.060> you<00:03:15.150> move

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
Anthony other works over then you move

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.390 
Anthony other works over then you move
them<00:03:15.450> back<00:03:15.480> if<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:15.959> row<00:03:16.200> so<00:03:16.470> we're<00:03:17.130> just<00:03:17.160> going

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
them back if you row so we're just going

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.150 
them back if you row so we're just going
to<00:03:17.459> move<00:03:17.640> this<00:03:17.790> work<00:03:18.090> on<00:03:18.239> f4<00:03:18.630> over<00:03:19.200> notice<00:03:20.010> I

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
to move this work on f4 over notice I

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.970 
to move this work on f4 over notice I
could<00:03:20.340> have<00:03:20.430> probably<00:03:20.550> move<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.060> rook<00:03:21.269> on<00:03:21.980> g3

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
could have probably move the rook on g3

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.650 
could have probably move the rook on g3
over<00:03:23.250> it<00:03:23.519> doesn't<00:03:23.730> really<00:03:23.970> matter<00:03:24.799> so<00:03:25.970> but<00:03:26.970> I'm

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
over it doesn't really matter so but I'm

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.009 
over it doesn't really matter so but I'm
going<00:03:27.900> to<00:03:27.959> move<00:03:28.140> the<00:03:28.260> rook<00:03:28.470> on<00:03:29.510> page<00:03:30.510> 4<00:03:30.780> over

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
going to move the rook on page 4 over

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.110 
going to move the rook on page 4 over
just<00:03:31.260> because<00:03:31.410> it'll<00:03:32.130> keep<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.489> box<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:33.060> little

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
just because it'll keep the box a little

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.680 
just because it'll keep the box a little
bit<00:03:33.600> smaller<00:03:34.140> if<00:03:34.590> I<00:03:34.769> move<00:03:34.980> this<00:03:35.010> one<00:03:35.310> over<00:03:35.690> the

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
bit smaller if I move this one over the

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.320 
bit smaller if I move this one over the
King<00:03:36.870> can<00:03:37.049> actually<00:03:37.320> move<00:03:37.500> over<00:03:37.890> and<00:03:38.330> you'll

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
King can actually move over and you'll

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.240 
King can actually move over and you'll
make<00:03:39.540> the<00:03:39.720> box<00:03:39.930> a<00:03:40.110> little<00:03:40.140> bit<00:03:40.380> bigger<00:03:40.680> but<00:03:41.160> I

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
make the box a little bit bigger but I

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.920 
make the box a little bit bigger but I
want<00:03:41.430> to<00:03:41.519> keep<00:03:41.640> the<00:03:41.760> Box<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.209> same<00:03:42.420> size<00:03:42.720> so

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
want to keep the Box the same size so

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.190 
want to keep the Box the same size so
I'm<00:03:42.989> going<00:03:43.140> to<00:03:43.200> move<00:03:43.320> this<00:03:43.590> rock<00:03:43.650> over

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
I'm going to move this rock over

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.900 
I'm going to move this rock over
now<00:03:45.830> notice<00:03:46.129> the<00:03:46.430> King<00:03:46.700> cannot<00:03:47.569> it's<00:03:48.440> um<00:03:48.910> it's

King cannot move to any of these scores

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.790 
King cannot move to any of these scores
red<00:03:55.280> and<00:03:55.519> these<00:03:55.700> are<00:03:55.910> the<00:03:56.030> squares<00:03:56.590> where<00:03:57.590> the

red and these are the squares where the
rooks<00:03:58.099> could<00:03:58.370> capture<00:03:58.670> if<00:03:58.970> the<00:03:59.120> king<00:03:59.330> 12<00:03:59.950> so<00:04:00.950> we

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
rooks could capture if the king 12 so we

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.009 
rooks could capture if the king 12 so we
didn't<00:04:01.220> make<00:04:01.310> the<00:04:01.459> Box<00:04:01.700> any<00:04:01.940> smaller<00:04:02.360> but<00:04:02.690> what

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
didn't make the Box any smaller but what

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:04.509 
didn't make the Box any smaller but what
we're<00:04:03.170> doing<00:04:03.200> is<00:04:03.530> regaining<00:04:03.890> the<00:04:04.040> ricks<00:04:04.310> to

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
we're doing is regaining the ricks to

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.900 
we're doing is regaining the ricks to
the<00:04:04.640> point<00:04:04.940> to<00:04:05.030> where<00:04:05.150> we<00:04:06.019> can<00:04:06.230> actually<00:04:06.910> make

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
the point to where we can actually make

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.600 
the point to where we can actually make
this<00:04:08.510> Spock<00:04:09.380> smaller<00:04:09.830> drive<00:04:10.280> the<00:04:10.430> king

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
this Spock smaller drive the king

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.370 
this Spock smaller drive the king
towards<00:04:10.940> the<00:04:11.000> edge<00:04:11.090> of<00:04:11.239> the<00:04:11.360> board<00:04:11.510> now<00:04:12.260> of

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
towards the edge of the board now of

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.229 
towards the edge of the board now of
course<00:04:12.530> the<00:04:12.769> King<00:04:13.010> noticing<00:04:13.610> it's<00:04:13.790> not<00:04:14.060> going

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
course the King noticing it's not going

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.449 
course the King noticing it's not going
to<00:04:14.330> be<00:04:14.390> able<00:04:14.420> to<00:04:14.780> come<00:04:15.590> over<00:04:15.830> to<00:04:15.920> capture<00:04:16.370> and

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
to be able to come over to capture and

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.789 
to be able to come over to capture and
rooks<00:04:16.760> on<00:04:16.970> this<00:04:17.150> side<00:04:17.450> anymore<00:04:17.810> now<00:04:18.680> it's

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
rooks on this side anymore now it's

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.409 
rooks on this side anymore now it's
gonna<00:04:18.919> have<00:04:19.040> to<00:04:19.070> run<00:04:19.310> back<00:04:19.370> to<00:04:19.790> the<00:04:19.820> other<00:04:20.090> side

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
gonna have to run back to the other side

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:22.390 
gonna have to run back to the other side
so<00:04:21.290> it's<00:04:21.380> going<00:04:21.500> to<00:04:21.590> start<00:04:21.859> running<00:04:22.280> towards

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
so it's going to start running towards

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.370 
so it's going to start running towards
the<00:04:22.610> other<00:04:22.729> side<00:04:24.010> and<00:04:25.010> now<00:04:25.190> we'll<00:04:25.430> just<00:04:26.380> looks

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
the other side and now we'll just looks

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.320 
the other side and now we'll just looks
ready<00:04:27.650> going<00:04:27.800> to<00:04:27.919> maybe<00:04:28.550> not<00:04:28.820> a<00:04:28.850> freebie<00:04:29.300> but

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
ready going to maybe not a freebie but

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.430 
ready going to maybe not a freebie but
we<00:04:29.600> can<00:04:29.750> move<00:04:29.960> this<00:04:30.229> work<00:04:30.470> on<00:04:30.650> g3<00:04:31.220> down<00:04:31.430> and

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
we can move this work on g3 down and

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.010 
we can move this work on g3 down and
make<00:04:33.440> it<00:04:33.590> move<00:04:33.740> back<00:04:33.979> a<00:04:34.010> little<00:04:34.190> bit<00:04:34.520> more<00:04:35.020> so

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
make it move back a little bit more so

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.520 
make it move back a little bit more so
does<00:04:36.169> i<00:04:36.350> move<00:04:36.500> the<00:04:36.620> rook<00:04:36.800> down<00:04:37.010> I<00:04:37.960> can<00:04:38.960> make<00:04:39.139> I'm

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
does i move the rook down I can make I'm

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.290 
does i move the rook down I can make I'm
making<00:04:39.889> the<00:04:40.010> Box<00:04:40.220> smaller<00:04:40.580> thing<00:04:40.970> is<00:04:41.120> now

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
making the Box smaller thing is now

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.379 
making the Box smaller thing is now
forced<00:04:41.780> to<00:04:41.900> go<00:04:42.080> back<00:04:42.280> towards<00:04:43.280> the<00:04:43.580> edge<00:04:44.060> of

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
forced to go back towards the edge of

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:48.969 
forced to go back towards the edge of
the<00:04:45.200> board<00:04:45.790> okay<00:04:46.790> because<00:04:47.060> it<00:04:47.210> can't<00:04:47.450> move<00:04:47.979> you

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:48.979 
the board okay because it can't move you

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:50.650 
the board okay because it can't move you
know<00:04:49.100> can't<00:04:49.400> stay<00:04:49.639> on<00:04:49.669> the<00:04:49.820> same<00:04:50.120> of<00:04:50.270> the<00:04:50.360> same

know can't stay on the same of the same

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.540 
know can't stay on the same of the same
road<00:04:50.900> it<00:04:51.110> can't<00:04:51.350> move<00:04:51.500> down<00:04:51.800> because<00:04:52.370> this

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
road it can't move down because this

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.290 
road it can't move down because this
rook<00:04:52.880> on<00:04:53.060> a<00:04:53.270> for<00:04:54.020> what<00:04:54.650> captured<00:04:55.220> and<00:04:55.970> I<00:04:56.060> can't

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
stay on this fifth row or else this

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.540 
stay on this fifth row or else this
broke<00:04:59.240> up<00:04:59.419> g5<00:05:00.410> would<00:05:00.680> captured<00:05:01.100> so<00:05:01.250> has<00:05:01.430> to

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
broke up g5 would captured so has to

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.990 
broke up g5 would captured so has to
move<00:05:01.639> back<00:05:01.850> move<00:05:02.479> back<00:05:02.510> towards<00:05:02.960> f6<00:05:03.440> of<00:05:03.620> course

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
move back move back towards f6 of course

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.909 
move back move back towards f6 of course
threatening<00:05:05.000> the<00:05:05.120> capture<00:05:05.570> of<00:05:05.600> the<00:05:05.720> rook<00:05:05.930> so

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
threatening the capture of the rook so

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.010 
threatening the capture of the rook so
now<00:05:07.010> the<00:05:07.070> rook<00:05:07.430> just<00:05:07.820> moves<00:05:08.180> all<00:05:08.510> the<00:05:08.780> way<00:05:08.870> over

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
now the rook just moves all the way over

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.570 
now the rook just moves all the way over
to<00:05:09.050> the<00:05:09.229> other<00:05:09.320> side<00:05:09.590> of<00:05:09.650> the<00:05:09.860> board

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
to the other side of the board

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.600 
to the other side of the board
okay<00:05:12.580> way<00:05:13.270> all<00:05:13.480> the<00:05:13.630> way<00:05:13.660> of<00:05:13.870> the<00:05:13.930> king<00:05:14.170> and<00:05:14.610> now

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
okay way all the way of the king and now

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.930 
okay way all the way of the king and now
look<00:05:16.210> these<00:05:16.810> are<00:05:16.990> all<00:05:17.020> the<00:05:17.350> squares<00:05:17.710> where<00:05:18.040> the

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
look these are all the squares where the

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.850 
look these are all the squares where the
rook<00:05:19.210> the<00:05:19.630> rooks<00:05:19.900> could<00:05:20.170> capture<00:05:20.410> the<00:05:20.680> king

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
rook the rooks could capture the king

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.290 
rook the rooks could capture the king
and<00:05:21.100> the<00:05:21.160> King<00:05:21.430> cannot<00:05:21.670> move<00:05:21.880> to<00:05:22.090> knee<00:05:22.210> of

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
and the King cannot move to knee of

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.540 
and the King cannot move to knee of
these<00:05:22.450> squares<00:05:22.920> of<00:05:23.920> course<00:05:24.070> it<00:05:24.190> doesn't<00:05:24.340> want

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
these squares of course it doesn't want

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.130 
these squares of course it doesn't want
to<00:05:24.610> move<00:05:24.670> back<00:05:24.910> so<00:05:25.660> it's<00:05:25.780> going<00:05:25.870> to<00:05:25.930> move<00:05:26.080> to

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.140 
to move back so it's going to move to

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.720 
to move back so it's going to move to
the<00:05:26.380> side<00:05:26.650> is<00:05:26.860> going<00:05:27.040> to<00:05:27.100> run<00:05:27.280> towards<00:05:27.670> the

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
the side is going to run towards the

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.780 
the side is going to run towards the
rooks<00:05:27.970> again<00:05:29.040> once<00:05:30.040> again<00:05:30.100> now<00:05:30.370> we<00:05:30.430> have<00:05:30.640> this

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
rooks again once again now we have this

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.240 
rooks again once again now we have this
pattern<00:05:31.240> worthy<00:05:31.600> where<00:05:32.320> the<00:05:32.440> rooks<00:05:32.860> will<00:05:33.040> just

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
pattern worthy where the rooks will just

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.970 
pattern worthy where the rooks will just
sort<00:05:33.430> of<00:05:33.550> maybe<00:05:33.910> seesaw<00:05:34.720> back<00:05:35.140> and<00:05:35.380> forth<00:05:35.650> or

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:35.980 
sort of maybe seesaw back and forth or

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.620 
sort of maybe seesaw back and forth or
climb<00:05:36.520> a<00:05:36.550> ladder<00:05:36.820> whatever<00:05:37.300> you<00:05:37.390> want<00:05:37.540> to

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
climb a ladder whatever you want to

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:38.940 
climb a ladder whatever you want to
think<00:05:37.780> of<00:05:37.870> how<00:05:38.110> you<00:05:38.140> want<00:05:38.410> to<00:05:38.440> think<00:05:38.620> about<00:05:38.710> it

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
think of how you want to think about it

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.490 
think of how you want to think about it
so<00:05:39.820> the<00:05:39.910> work<00:05:40.090> comes<00:05:40.300> up<00:05:40.480> again<00:05:40.840> notice<00:05:41.290> the

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
so the work comes up again notice the

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.980 
so the work comes up again notice the
squares<00:05:41.920> the<00:05:42.730> rooks<00:05:43.030> could<00:05:43.270> capture<00:05:43.510> the<00:05:43.810> king

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
squares the rooks could capture the king

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.950 
squares the rooks could capture the king
on<00:05:44.230> the<00:05:44.910> King<00:05:45.910> cannot<00:05:46.270> move<00:05:46.450> to<00:05:46.660> any<00:05:46.780> of<00:05:46.840> the

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
on the King cannot move to any of the

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.530 
on the King cannot move to any of the
squares<00:05:47.260> of<00:05:47.350> red<00:05:47.740> so<00:05:48.460> it's<00:05:48.580> actually<00:05:48.700> forced

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540 
squares of red so it's actually forced

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.710 
squares of red so it's actually forced
back<00:05:49.930> towards<00:05:50.770> the<00:05:50.980> side<00:05:51.370> of<00:05:51.550> the<00:05:51.640> board<00:05:51.910> but

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 
back towards the side of the board but

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.150 
back towards the side of the board but
of<00:05:52.810> course<00:05:53.020> is<00:05:53.200> once<00:05:53.560> again<00:05:53.620> I'm<00:05:53.830> going<00:05:53.950> to<00:05:54.040> run

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
of course is once again I'm going to run

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.240 
of course is once again I'm going to run
towards<00:05:54.460> the<00:05:54.520> rooks<00:05:55.320> not<00:05:56.320> able<00:05:56.590> to<00:05:56.920> get<00:05:57.100> in

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
towards the rooks not able to get in

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:02.340 
towards the rooks not able to get in
another<00:05:58.150> rook<00:05:58.450> move<00:05:59.580> moving<00:06:00.580> it<00:06:00.820> back<00:06:01.350> once

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:02.350 
another rook move moving it back once

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.700 
another rook move moving it back once
again<00:06:02.500> it<00:06:02.980> is<00:06:03.670> forced<00:06:04.330> back<00:06:04.810> towards<00:06:05.290> the<00:06:05.380> side

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
again it is forced back towards the side

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.110 
again it is forced back towards the side
of<00:06:05.980> the<00:06:06.100> board<00:06:06.870> or<00:06:07.870> else<00:06:08.670> because<00:06:09.670> the<00:06:09.910> rooks

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
of the board or else because the rooks

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.420 
of the board or else because the rooks
controller<00:06:10.840> would<00:06:11.230> capture<00:06:11.590> it<00:06:11.950> if<00:06:12.100> it<00:06:12.250> moved

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
controller would capture it if it moved

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.310 
controller would capture it if it moved
anywhere<00:06:12.820> else<00:06:13.000> except<00:06:13.720> for<00:06:13.900> these<00:06:14.020> three

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.320 
anywhere else except for these three

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.160 
anywhere else except for these three
squares<00:06:14.740> up<00:06:14.980> here<00:06:15.220> so<00:06:16.000> the<00:06:16.120> King<00:06:16.360> has<00:06:16.660> to<00:06:16.960> run

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:17.170 
squares up here so the King has to run

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:20.340 
squares up here so the King has to run
to<00:06:17.980> one<00:06:18.160> of<00:06:18.280> these<00:06:18.430> three<00:06:18.640> squares<00:06:19.090> of<00:06:20.080> course

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:20.350 
to one of these three squares of course

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.500 
to one of these three squares of course
it's<00:06:20.530> going<00:06:20.560> to<00:06:20.740> move<00:06:20.860> this<00:06:21.130> one<00:06:21.370> as<00:06:21.610> I<00:06:22.120> wants

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:22.510 
it's going to move this one as I wants

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.510 
it's going to move this one as I wants
to<00:06:22.630> capture<00:06:22.900> the<00:06:23.290> rook<00:06:23.500> so<00:06:24.280> now<00:06:24.370> i'm<00:06:24.460> just

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 
to capture the rook so now i'm just

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.460 
to capture the rook so now i'm just
going<00:06:24.760> to<00:06:24.790> swing<00:06:25.060> my<00:06:25.210> rooks<00:06:25.510> over<00:06:26.020> one<00:06:26.290> more

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.470 
going to swing my rooks over one more

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:30.840 
going to swing my rooks over one more
time<00:06:26.550> all<00:06:27.550> the<00:06:27.940> way<00:06:28.030> over<00:06:28.650> okay<00:06:29.650> i'm<00:06:30.610> probably

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:30.850 
time all the way over okay i'm probably

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:32.520 
time all the way over okay i'm probably
going<00:06:31.060> to<00:06:31.180> move<00:06:31.660> the<00:06:31.840> rook<00:06:32.020> a<00:06:32.140> little<00:06:32.380> bit

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:32.530 
going to move the rook a little bit

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.280 
going to move the rook a little bit
closer<00:06:32.880> just<00:06:33.880> to<00:06:34.030> make<00:06:34.210> the<00:06:34.360> box<00:06:34.600> smaller<00:06:35.020> but

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:35.290 
closer just to make the box smaller but

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:37.290 
closer just to make the box smaller but
it<00:06:35.860> does<00:06:36.040> at<00:06:36.250> this<00:06:36.490> point<00:06:36.760> it<00:06:36.850> doesn't<00:06:37.000> matter

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:37.300 
it does at this point it doesn't matter

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.180 
it does at this point it doesn't matter
the<00:06:37.540> king<00:06:37.750> will<00:06:37.930> not<00:06:38.080> have<00:06:38.260> time<00:06:38.470> to<00:06:38.740> run<00:06:38.950> over

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.190 
the king will not have time to run over

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.310 
the king will not have time to run over
to<00:06:39.310> the<00:06:39.340> other<00:06:39.520> side<00:06:39.850> of<00:06:39.910> the<00:06:40.060> board<00:06:40.300> and<00:06:40.540> to

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:41.320 
to the other side of the board and to

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.620 
to the other side of the board and to
capture<00:06:41.740> the<00:06:41.860> rooks<00:06:42.100> so<00:06:43.000> now<00:06:43.150> the<00:06:43.210> king<00:06:43.510> is

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:43.630 
capture the rooks so now the king is

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:47.340 
capture the rooks so now the king is
sort<00:06:43.840> of<00:06:43.930> stuck<00:06:45.000> okay<00:06:46.000> and<00:06:46.690> now<00:06:46.780> the<00:06:46.840> king<00:06:47.140> is

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:47.350 
sort of stuck okay and now the king is

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:49.260 
sort of stuck okay and now the king is
actually<00:06:47.680> going<00:06:47.860> to<00:06:48.220> run<00:06:48.550> it<00:06:48.820> doesn't<00:06:49.060> want<00:06:49.180> to

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.270 
actually going to run it doesn't want to

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.980 
actually going to run it doesn't want to
run<00:06:49.450> to<00:06:50.380> d8<00:06:50.890> because<00:06:51.700> it's<00:06:52.090> that<00:06:52.810> be

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:52.990 
run to d8 because it's that be

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:54.930 
run to d8 because it's that be
checkmated<00:06:53.440> one<00:06:53.770> we'd<00:06:54.190> actually<00:06:54.400> just<00:06:54.730> move

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:54.940 
checkmated one we'd actually just move

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.480 
checkmated one we'd actually just move
this<00:06:55.540> drawing<00:06:55.750> on<00:06:55.900> 86<00:06:56.290> down<00:06:56.530> and<00:06:56.860> be<00:06:57.010> checkmate

this drawing on 86 down and be checkmate
it<00:06:58.180> actually<00:06:58.420> has<00:06:58.690> to<00:06:58.930> come<00:06:59.200> over<00:06:59.500> to<00:06:59.800> two

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:01.750 
it actually has to come over to two

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:05.520 
it actually has to come over to two
aight<00:07:01.960> to<00:07:02.500> save<00:07:02.770> checkmate<00:07:04.080> notice<00:07:05.080> that<00:07:05.110> so

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:05.530 
aight to save checkmate notice that so

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.200 
aight to save checkmate notice that so
like<00:07:05.830> before<00:07:06.190> if<00:07:06.280> the<00:07:06.460> rookin<00:07:06.820> to<00:07:06.970> move<00:07:07.120> the

like before if the rookin to move the

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:08.940 
like before if the rookin to move the
other<00:07:07.330> work<00:07:07.720> would<00:07:07.840> just<00:07:07.990> move<00:07:08.110> here<00:07:08.380> and<00:07:08.740> be

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:08.950 
other work would just move here and be

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:11.610 
other work would just move here and be
checked<00:07:09.280> me<00:07:09.690> so<00:07:10.690> now<00:07:10.840> this<00:07:11.050> rook<00:07:11.320> is<00:07:11.440> just

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:11.620 
checked me so now this rook is just

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:15.660 
checked me so now this rook is just
going<00:07:11.800> to<00:07:11.920> move<00:07:12.100> all<00:07:12.280> the<00:07:12.640> way<00:07:12.670> over<00:07:13.950> ok<00:07:14.950> once

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:15.670 
going to move all the way over ok once

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:17.430 
going to move all the way over ok once
again<00:07:15.820> the<00:07:16.060> king<00:07:16.270> is<00:07:16.420> trapped<00:07:16.780> on<00:07:16.990> this<00:07:17.140> side

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:17.440 
again the king is trapped on this side

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.070 
again the king is trapped on this side
of<00:07:17.590> the<00:07:17.680> board<00:07:17.890> now<00:07:18.120> and<00:07:19.120> it<00:07:19.390> can't<00:07:19.600> move<00:07:19.780> any

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:20.080 
of the board now and it can't move any

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.510 
of the board now and it can't move any
of<00:07:20.110> these<00:07:20.230> red<00:07:20.500> squares<00:07:20.860> it<00:07:21.040> can't<00:07:21.250> get<00:07:21.400> out

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:21.520 
of these red squares it can't get out

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.110 
of these red squares it can't get out
it's<00:07:22.150> now<00:07:22.330> trap<00:07:22.720> along<00:07:23.080> the<00:07:23.680> back<00:07:23.890> here<00:07:24.120> Kings

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:25.120 
it's now trap along the back here Kings

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.580 
it's now trap along the back here Kings
just<00:07:25.330> going<00:07:25.450> to<00:07:25.510> move<00:07:25.630> over<00:07:25.750> one<00:07:25.930> and<00:07:26.410> then

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:26.590 
just going to move over one and then

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.530 
just going to move over one and then
we're<00:07:26.740> going<00:07:26.830> to<00:07:26.890> deliver<00:07:27.160> checkmate<00:07:27.760> all<00:07:28.300> the

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:28.540 
we're going to deliver checkmate all the

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.930 
we're going to deliver checkmate all the
way<00:07:28.630> down<00:07:28.870> and<00:07:29.080> notice<00:07:30.040> this<00:07:30.250> is<00:07:30.460> checkmate

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:30.940 
way down and notice this is checkmate

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.080 
way down and notice this is checkmate
because<00:07:31.300> as<00:07:31.660> the<00:07:31.930> King<00:07:32.140> has<00:07:32.290> nowhere<00:07:32.770> to<00:07:33.040> move

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:33.090 
because as the King has nowhere to move

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.850 
because as the King has nowhere to move
because<00:07:34.090> the<00:07:34.300> rooks<00:07:34.600> can<00:07:35.050> capture<00:07:35.350> anywhere

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:35.860 
because the rooks can capture anywhere

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.760 
because the rooks can capture anywhere
longhairs<00:07:36.280> anywhere<00:07:36.730> where<00:07:36.940> the<00:07:37.030> King<00:07:37.270> moves

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:37.770 
longhairs anywhere where the King moves

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:41.400 
longhairs anywhere where the King moves
now<00:07:38.770> it<00:07:39.400> is<00:07:40.090> checkmate<00:07:40.960> I<00:07:40.990> should<00:07:41.260> probably

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:41.410 
now it is checkmate I should probably

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:43.860 
now it is checkmate I should probably
highlight
