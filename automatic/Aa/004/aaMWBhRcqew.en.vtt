00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
hey this is a quick video to show you

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.019 
hey this is a quick video to show you
how<00:00:02.520> I<00:00:02.550> made<00:00:02.970> a<00:00:03.240> battery<00:00:04.230> just<00:00:05.130> using<00:00:05.700> some<00:00:05.940> old

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
how I made a battery just using some old

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.020 
how I made a battery just using some old
extension<00:00:06.540> cord<00:00:06.779> wire<00:00:07.460> see<00:00:08.460> middle<00:00:08.730> screws

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
extension cord wire see middle screws

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.010 
extension cord wire see middle screws
and<00:00:09.469> a<00:00:10.469> ice<00:00:11.309> cube<00:00:11.550> tray

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.020 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.330 

that's<00:00:16.020> all<00:00:16.170> you<00:00:16.320> need<00:00:16.470> right<00:00:16.500> there<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.189> make

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
that's all you need right there to make

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.480 
that's all you need right there to make
a<00:00:17.400> homemade<00:00:18.000> battery<00:00:18.860> so<00:00:19.860> you<00:00:19.920> can<00:00:20.130> make<00:00:20.279> that

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
a homemade battery so you can make that

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.420 
a homemade battery so you can make that
size<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.970> try<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.270> out<00:00:21.420> if<00:00:21.570> you<00:00:21.689> want<00:00:21.900> at<00:00:21.990> first

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
size to try it out if you want at first

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.440 
size to try it out if you want at first
you<00:00:23.430> just<00:00:23.550> wanted<00:00:23.759> to<00:00:23.789> show<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.000> some<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.329> the

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:24.450 
you just wanted to show you some of the

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.029 
you just wanted to show you some of the
stuff<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:24.840> was<00:00:24.869> able<00:00:25.169> to<00:00:25.230> run<00:00:25.410> with<00:00:25.619> these<00:00:25.740> water

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
stuff I was able to run with these water

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.929 
stuff I was able to run with these water
batteries<00:00:26.599> all<00:00:27.599> you<00:00:27.779> really<00:00:27.930> need<00:00:28.169> to<00:00:28.230> do<00:00:28.939> drip

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
batteries all you really need to do drip

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:37.970 
batteries all you really need to do drip
off<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.150> insulation<00:00:36.290> then<00:00:37.290> just<00:00:37.620> twist<00:00:37.770> them

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
off the insulation then just twist them

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.540 
off the insulation then just twist them
up<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.430> wires<00:00:38.670> stay<00:00:39.000> together<00:00:43.520> take<00:00:44.520> a

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
up so the wires stay together take a

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.060 
up so the wires stay together take a
little<00:00:44.820> nail<00:00:45.090> or<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.390> sheet<00:00:45.660> metal<00:00:46.410> screw<00:00:46.739> and

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
little nail or a sheet metal screw and

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.549 
little nail or a sheet metal screw and
simply<00:00:47.969> wrap<00:00:48.179> the<00:00:48.210> copper<00:00:48.870> around<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.289> top

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
simply wrap the copper around the top

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.840 
simply wrap the copper around the top
like<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.159> couple<00:00:50.609> of<00:00:50.670> times<00:00:52.699> and<00:00:53.699> then

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
like this a couple of times and then

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.270 
like this a couple of times and then
just<00:00:54.239> kind<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.480> bend<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.839> there<00:00:56.269> make<00:00:57.269> an<00:00:57.420> arch

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
just kind of bend it there make an arch

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.950 
just kind of bend it there make an arch
all<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.429> have<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.699> do<00:00:59.879> now

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.330 

slip<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.170> on<00:01:04.350> there<00:01:04.530> like<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:07.340> here's

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
slip that on there like that and here's

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.790 
slip that on there like that and here's

there's<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.800> volt<00:01:44.010> rating<00:01:44.430> just<00:01:44.960> for

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
there's the volt rating just for

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.580 
there's the volt rating just for
reference<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.910> 14<00:01:47.910> cell<00:01:48.210> battery<00:01:48.600> this

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
reference that is a 14 cell battery this

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.990 
reference that is a 14 cell battery this
is<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.920> simpler<00:01:50.700> two<00:01:50.940> cell<00:01:51.240> battery<00:01:51.920> again<00:01:53.000> 1.5

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
is a simpler two cell battery again 1.5

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.360 
is a simpler two cell battery again 1.5
volts<00:01:54.390> almost<00:01:54.690> exactly<00:01:55.650> the<00:01:55.830> same<00:01:55.860> as<00:01:56.070> you'd

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
volts almost exactly the same as you'd

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.400 
volts almost exactly the same as you'd
get<00:01:56.550> out<00:01:56.580> of<00:01:56.760> a<00:01:56.850> standard<00:01:57.090> double<00:01:57.690> a<00:01:57.930> triple<00:01:57.960> a

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
get out of a standard double a triple a

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.720 

it<00:02:02.540> is<00:02:05.500> this<00:02:06.500> one<00:02:06.680> only<00:02:06.890> takes<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.280> two<00:02:07.460> water

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
it is this one only takes the two water

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.690 
it is this one only takes the two water
cells<00:02:08.119> so<00:02:08.869> just<00:02:09.110> two<00:02:09.350> shot<00:02:10.190> glass<00:02:10.429> sized

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
cells so just two shot glass sized

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.570 
cells so just two shot glass sized
