cashed<00:00:21.039> a<00:00:21.430> check<00:00:21.999> there<00:00:22.150> on<00:00:22.269> the<00:00:22.330> side<00:00:22.539> of<00:00:22.660> the

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
cashed a check there on the side of the

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.009 
cashed a check there on the side of the
place<00:00:22.960> Mike<00:00:23.499> Riley<00:00:23.710> the<00:00:23.890> referee<00:00:24.130> calling<00:00:24.339> for

place Mike Riley the referee calling for

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.120 
place Mike Riley the referee calling for
it<00:00:26.019> so<00:00:26.199> she's<00:00:26.380> trying<00:00:26.529> to<00:00:26.619> become<00:00:26.740> one<00:00:26.890> just

it so she's trying to become one just

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.560 
it so she's trying to become one just
now<00:00:27.310> I<00:00:27.579> think<00:00:27.939> it<00:00:27.999> was<00:00:28.089> with<00:00:28.240> the<00:00:28.329> court<00:00:28.539> I

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:29.759 
now I think it was with the court I
think<00:00:28.599> it<00:00:28.779> was<00:00:28.869> just<00:00:29.019> with<00:00:29.140> either<00:00:29.289> just<00:00:29.619> below

think it was just with either just below
the<00:00:29.980> knee<00:00:30.189> or<00:00:30.249> maybe<00:00:30.849> just<00:00:30.999> the<00:00:31.119> sin<00:00:31.419> catching

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:31.839 
the knee or maybe just the sin catching

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:33.840 
the knee or maybe just the sin catching
the<00:00:31.900> goalkeeper<00:00:32.410> just<00:00:32.650> there<00:00:32.829> look<00:00:33.010> just<00:00:33.730> on
