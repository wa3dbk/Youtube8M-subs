hello<00:00:16.440> there's<00:00:16.710> some<00:00:16.890> regen<00:00:17.539> 14,000<00:00:18.539> foot

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
hello there's some regen 14,000 foot

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.200 
hello there's some regen 14,000 foot
pounds<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:19.050> torque<00:00:20.000> that<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.060> awesome<00:00:21.600> region

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
pounds of torque that is awesome region

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.820 
pounds of torque that is awesome region
it<00:00:24.210> takes<00:00:24.510> some<00:00:24.750> getting<00:00:25.109> used<00:00:25.350> to

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
it takes some getting used to

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.439 
it takes some getting used to
but<00:00:26.279> yeah<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.519> don't<00:00:26.880> really<00:00:27.029> need<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.390> use

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
but yeah you don't really need to use

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.259 
but yeah you don't really need to use
the<00:00:27.660> brake<00:00:27.869> pedal<00:00:28.230> most<00:00:28.500> applications<00:00:29.369> but

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
the brake pedal most applications but

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.600 
the brake pedal most applications but
you<00:00:30.359> do<00:00:30.570> need<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.900> let<00:00:31.080> off<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.470> gas<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:32.070> little

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
you do need to let off the gas a little

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.370 
you do need to let off the gas a little
more<00:00:33.000> smoothly<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.450> there's<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.899> shifting

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
more smoothly and there's that shifting

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.700 
more smoothly and there's that shifting
into<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.770> second<00:00:35.130> gear

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.540 

and<00:00:38.070> yeah<00:00:38.310> it's<00:00:38.550> interesting<00:00:38.790> because<00:00:39.180> when<00:00:39.480> I

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
and yeah it's interesting because when I

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.730 
and yeah it's interesting because when I
set<00:00:41.550> regen<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.660> max<00:00:42.930> we'll<00:00:43.320> turn<00:00:43.470> left

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:43.740 
set regen to the max we'll turn left

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:49.040 
set regen to the max we'll turn left
here<00:00:44.360> on<00:00:45.360> my<00:00:46.760> so<00:00:47.760> yeah<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.210> sent<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.600> regen<00:00:48.900> to

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
here on my so yeah I sent the regen to

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.440 
here on my so yeah I sent the regen to
max<00:00:49.290> on<00:00:49.500> my<00:00:49.620> electric<00:00:49.980> motorcycle<00:00:50.580> to<00:00:51.270> get

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.450 
max on my electric motorcycle to get

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:58.660 
max on my electric motorcycle to get
accustomed<00:00:51.810> to<00:00:52.970> that<00:00:53.970> feeling<00:00:55.850> of<00:00:56.850> having<00:00:57.239> to

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
accustomed to that feeling of having to

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.160 
accustomed to that feeling of having to
have<00:00:59.670> some<00:00:59.940> strength<00:01:00.330> while<00:01:00.629> rolling<00:01:00.870> off

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
have some strength while rolling off

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.250 
have some strength while rolling off
because<00:01:02.160> it's<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:02.850> easy<00:01:03.150> to<00:01:03.300> just<00:01:03.629> snap<00:01:04.050> the

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
because it's so easy to just snap the

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.710 
because it's so easy to just snap the
throttle<00:01:04.650> shut<00:01:04.860> on<00:01:05.160> my<00:01:05.489> gas<00:01:05.970> motorcycle

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
throttle shut on my gas motorcycle

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.410 
throttle shut on my gas motorcycle
that's<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.710> full<00:01:07.890> stop<00:01:08.130> it's<00:01:08.880> kind<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.119> cool<00:01:09.270> to

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
that's a full stop it's kind of cool to

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.820 
that's a full stop it's kind of cool to
be<00:01:09.479> able<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.750> do<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.840> full<00:01:10.050> stop<00:01:10.259> without<00:01:10.590> even

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
be able to do a full stop without even

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.700 
be able to do a full stop without even
having<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.340> put<00:01:12.030> your<00:01:12.149> foot<00:01:12.270> on<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.450> brake

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
having to put your foot on the brake

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.310 
having to put your foot on the brake
but<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:14.759> anyways<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.630> did<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.080> on<00:01:16.140> the

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
well now we're at 40 85 and that feels

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.970 
well now we're at 40 85 and that feels
fast<00:02:29.510> enough<00:02:29.810> in<00:02:29.959> this<00:02:30.110> car<00:02:30.410> like<00:02:30.440> am<00:02:30.830> you<00:02:30.950> know

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
should this track excuse me

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.059

I'm<00:02:33.180> sure<00:02:33.540> we<00:02:33.750> could<00:02:34.019> go<00:02:34.200> faster<00:02:35.569> oMG<00:02:36.709> and<00:02:37.709> the

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
I'm sure we could go faster oMG and the

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.440 
I'm sure we could go faster oMG and the
mirror<00:02:38.280> seems<00:02:38.609> to<00:02:38.790> be<00:02:38.849> telling<00:02:39.180> me<00:02:39.269> there's

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
mirror seems to be telling me there's

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.940 
mirror seems to be telling me there's
nobody<00:02:39.659> enough

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
nobody enough

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.390 
nobody enough
trust

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
trust

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:52.740 
trust
think<00:02:45.400> about<00:02:45.549> the<00:02:45.760> giant<00:02:46.120> box<00:02:46.659> man

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:03:01.880 

you'll<00:02:53.750> get<00:02:53.840> that<00:02:53.990> downshift<00:02:54.410> again

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.059 

this<00:03:02.460> would<00:03:03.030> be<00:03:03.300> so<00:03:04.140> much<00:03:04.319> fun<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.680> drive<00:03:04.800> on<00:03:05.040> a

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
this would be so much fun to drive on a

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.820 
this would be so much fun to drive on a
regular<00:03:05.400> basis<00:03:05.760> because<00:03:06.200> once<00:03:07.200> you<00:03:07.350> get<00:03:07.530> used

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
regular basis because once you get used

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.340 
regular basis because once you get used
to<00:03:08.130> the<00:03:08.400> power<00:03:08.610> delivery<00:03:09.150> and<00:03:09.390> you<00:03:09.990> can<00:03:10.140> see

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
to the power delivery and you can see

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.350 
to the power delivery and you can see
the<00:03:10.470> road<00:03:10.650> here<00:03:10.950> it's<00:03:11.100> like<00:03:11.340> skin<00:03:11.850> and<00:03:11.880> up<00:03:12.090> from

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
tracks this is actually part of the

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.100 
tracks this is actually part of the
track<00:03:16.470> that's<00:03:17.280> a<00:03:17.459> long<00:03:17.610> reach<00:03:17.819> Humphrey

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
track that's a long reach Humphrey

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.800 
track that's a long reach Humphrey
it<00:03:20.350> was<00:03:20.470> really<00:03:20.740> fun<00:03:20.950> to<00:03:21.130> be<00:03:21.250> able<00:03:21.610> to

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
it was really fun to be able to

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.330 
it was really fun to be able to
participate<00:03:22.810> in<00:03:23.110> that<00:03:23.230> for<00:03:23.560> a<00:03:23.590> moment<00:03:23.950> and<00:03:24.160> a

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
participate in that for a moment and a

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.000 
participate in that for a moment and a
vehicle<00:03:24.730> much<00:03:25.000> larger<00:03:25.510> than<00:03:25.720> this<00:03:26.530> normally

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
vehicle much larger than this normally

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.900 
vehicle much larger than this normally
raised<00:03:27.220> here<00:03:28.800> so<00:03:29.800> it's<00:03:30.040> definitely<00:03:30.490> a<00:03:30.610> matter

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
raised here so it's definitely a matter

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.410 
raised here so it's definitely a matter
of<00:03:31.290> finessing<00:03:32.670> what<00:03:33.670> you're<00:03:33.820> doing<00:03:34.120> with<00:03:34.270> your

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
of finessing what you're doing with your

of finessing what you're doing with your
right<00:03:34.570> foot<00:03:34.600> and<00:03:35.140> I'm<00:03:35.440> getting<00:03:36.400> accustomed<00:03:36.670> to

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
right foot and I'm getting accustomed to

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.370 
right foot and I'm getting accustomed to
that<00:03:38.760> release<00:03:39.760> you<00:03:40.240> know<00:03:40.360> as<00:03:40.480> you<00:03:40.690> let<00:03:41.020> off<00:03:41.170> the

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
that release you know as you let off the

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.220 
that release you know as you let off the
gas<00:03:43.020> but<00:03:44.020> the<00:03:44.140> reward<00:03:44.530> for<00:03:44.710> that<00:03:44.770> is

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
gas but the reward for that is

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.899 
gas but the reward for that is
it's<00:03:46.560> matter<00:03:46.769> power<00:03:47.040> which<00:03:47.459> is<00:03:47.610> really

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:47.909 
it's matter power which is really
