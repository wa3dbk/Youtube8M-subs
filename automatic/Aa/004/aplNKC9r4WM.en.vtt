along with disco and it is still one of
the<00:00:26.880> best<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.570> neat<00:00:27.720> thing<00:00:27.900> about<00:00:27.930> this

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
the best the neat thing about this

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.320 
the best the neat thing about this
cocktails<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:28.949> it's<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.220> layer<00:00:29.429> drink<00:00:29.849> so<00:00:30.240> you

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
cocktails that it's a layer drink so you

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.820 
cocktails that it's a layer drink so you
can<00:00:30.480> see<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.750> distinct<00:00:31.260> layers<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.800> the

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
can see the distinct layers of the

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.500 
can see the distinct layers of the
different<00:00:32.130> spirits<00:00:32.579> in<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.790> glass<00:00:32.969> the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
different spirits in the glass the

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.970 
different spirits in the glass the
reason<00:00:33.870> this<00:00:33.989> happens<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.469> because<00:00:34.530> each

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
reason this happens is because each

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.920 
reason this happens is because each
spirit<00:00:35.430> has<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.579> different<00:00:35.940> density<00:00:36.090> there<00:00:36.719> for

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
spirit has a different density there for

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.020 
spirit has a different density there for
some<00:00:37.200> float<00:00:37.500> above<00:00:37.770> others<00:00:38.129> so<00:00:38.730> instead<00:00:38.969> of

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
some float above others so instead of

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.490 
some float above others so instead of
shaking<00:00:39.300> or<00:00:39.660> stirring<00:00:39.930> we're<00:00:40.230> going<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.410> be

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
shaking or stirring we're going to be

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.440 
shaking or stirring we're going to be
building<00:00:40.739> all<00:00:41.610> right<00:00:41.790> let's<00:00:42.000> get<00:00:42.090> started

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
building all right let's get started

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.389 
building all right let's get started
normally<00:00:43.379> you'd<00:00:43.559> want<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.829> use<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:43.950> cordial

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
normally you'd want to use a cordial

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.150 
normally you'd want to use a cordial
glass<00:00:44.670> which<00:00:45.000> looks<00:00:45.239> like<00:00:45.300> this<00:00:45.980> but<00:00:46.980> most

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
glass which looks like this but most

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.770 
glass which looks like this but most
people<00:00:47.399> don't<00:00:47.460> have<00:00:47.610> those<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.210> laying<00:00:48.539> around

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
people don't have those is laying around

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.360 
people don't have those is laying around
the<00:00:48.840> house<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.739> I'm<00:00:49.860> just<00:00:50.010> going<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.190> use<00:00:50.340> a

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
the house so I'm just going to use a

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.490 
the house so I'm just going to use a
champagne<00:00:50.879> flute<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.840> important<00:00:52.289> thing<00:00:52.350> here

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
champagne flute the important thing here

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.979 
champagne flute the important thing here
is<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.829> use<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.070> thin<00:00:53.460> narrow<00:00:53.730> glass<00:00:54.120> now<00:00:54.930> the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
is to use a thin narrow glass now the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.810 
is to use a thin narrow glass now the
actual<00:00:55.379> amount<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.039> spirit<00:00:56.430> isn't<00:00:56.550> really

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
actual amount of the spirit isn't really

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.760 
actual amount of the spirit isn't really
important<00:00:57.239> here<00:00:57.449> but<00:00:57.780> what<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.109> important<00:00:58.649> is

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
important here but what is important is

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.040 
important here but what is important is
the<00:00:58.920> ratio<00:00:59.129> so<00:00:59.730> we<00:00:59.850> want<00:01:00.059> equal<00:01:00.359> parts<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.930> each

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
the ratio so we want equal parts of each

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.260 
the ratio so we want equal parts of each
spirit<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:02.129> first<00:01:02.370> we<00:01:02.579> add<00:01:02.699> one<00:01:02.910> jigger<00:01:03.180> of

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
spirit so first we add one jigger of

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:10.300 
spirit so first we add one jigger of
Kahlua<00:01:03.690> which<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.320> one<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> half<00:01:04.650> ounces

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.340 

and<00:01:10.399> that<00:01:11.090> we<00:01:11.240> can<00:01:11.360> just<00:01:11.390> pour<00:01:11.720> normally<00:01:12.140> into

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
and that we can just pour normally into

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.230 
and that we can just pour normally into
the<00:01:12.439> glass<00:01:15.130> but<00:01:16.130> for<00:01:16.280> the<00:01:16.369> second<00:01:16.759> spirit<00:01:17.119> we

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
the glass but for the second spirit we

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.940 
the glass but for the second spirit we
want<00:01:17.420> to<00:01:17.479> gently<00:01:17.780> pour<00:01:18.140> it<00:01:18.259> on<00:01:18.350> top<00:01:18.470> of<00:01:18.829> this

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
want to gently pour it on top of this

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.560 
want to gently pour it on top of this
layer<00:01:19.189> so<00:01:19.430> it<00:01:19.520> doesn't<00:01:19.729> mix<00:01:19.850> in<00:01:20.030> with<00:01:20.180> it<00:01:20.329> now

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
layer so it doesn't mix in with it now

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:21.969 
layer so it doesn't mix in with it now
the<00:01:20.630> easiest<00:01:20.840> way<00:01:21.229> to<00:01:21.289> do<00:01:21.470> that<00:01:21.590> is<00:01:21.649> to<00:01:21.770> take

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
the easiest way to do that is to take

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:23.889 
the easiest way to do that is to take
the<00:01:22.130> back<00:01:22.310> of<00:01:22.460> a<00:01:22.520> spoon<00:01:22.700> and<00:01:23.090> use<00:01:23.390> it<00:01:23.539> almost<00:01:23.689> as

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 
the back of a spoon and use it almost as

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:25.810 
the back of a spoon and use it almost as
a<00:01:23.930> ramp<00:01:24.289> for<00:01:24.649> the<00:01:24.770> liquid<00:01:24.950> to<00:01:25.070> slowly<00:01:25.430> pour

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
a ramp for the liquid to slowly pour

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.090 
a ramp for the liquid to slowly pour
down<00:01:26.000> so<00:01:26.600> we<00:01:26.750> add<00:01:26.840> another<00:01:27.170> jigger<00:01:27.500> of<00:01:27.590> Baileys

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
down so we add another jigger of Baileys

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.539 
down so we add another jigger of Baileys
Irish<00:01:28.220> cream<00:01:32.710> and<00:01:33.710> we<00:01:33.799> want<00:01:33.979> to<00:01:34.039> pour<00:01:34.220> it<00:01:34.310> very

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
Irish cream and we want to pour it very

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:43.020 
Irish cream and we want to pour it very
slowly

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.260 

and<00:01:45.100> finally<00:01:46.100> one<00:01:46.310> more<00:01:46.490> jigger<00:01:46.729> of<00:01:46.850> orange

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
and finally one more jigger of orange

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.820 
and finally one more jigger of orange
flavored<00:01:47.600> liqueur<00:01:47.930> I<00:01:48.140> happen<00:01:48.710> to<00:01:48.740> have

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
flavored liqueur I happen to have

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.890
