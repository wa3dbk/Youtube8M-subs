00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
second down does that mean that's the

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.250 
second down does that mean that's the
second<00:04:34.830> time<00:04:34.919> they<00:04:35.100> fell<00:04:35.340> down<00:04:35.370> I<00:04:35.850> said<00:04:36.260> no

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
second down is how many I guess they can

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.000 
second down is how many I guess they can
play<00:04:39.090> four<00:04:39.360> times<00:04:39.660> but<00:04:40.110> then<00:04:40.289> she<00:04:40.740> was<00:04:40.860> well

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
play four times but then she was well

play four times but then she was well
what's<00:04:41.190> the<00:04:41.370> end<00:04:41.520> ten<00:04:41.850> I<00:04:42.090> said<00:04:42.300> I<00:04:42.330> think<00:04:42.449> that's

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
what's the end ten I said I think that's

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.810 
what's the end ten I said I think that's
ten<00:04:42.960> yards<00:04:43.320> so<00:04:43.470> you<00:04:43.530> get<00:04:43.710> a<00:04:43.740> first<00:04:44.070> and<00:04:44.699> she

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
ten yards so you get a first and she

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.129 
ten yards so you get a first and she
goes<00:04:44.970> and<00:04:45.060> how<00:04:45.270> many<00:04:45.449> first<00:04:45.660> can<00:04:45.900> you<00:04:45.990> get<00:04:46.110> I

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
goes and how many first can you get I

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.290
