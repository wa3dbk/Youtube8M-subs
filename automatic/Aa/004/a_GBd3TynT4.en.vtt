00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.120
 if the sports rugby and breathe alone are too boring he should go 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.110
 The combination of both tasting is underwater rugby 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.949
 So far, this team sport is still a relatively unknown fringe sport 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:23.460
 which is mainly because this sport is rather unsuitable for spectators 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.300
 Unwell if you have a snorkel with you 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.760
 My colleagues Danny Ecker and Marcel Witte, we are for them anyway 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.620
 recommends the bath on diving station we went to the sport 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.620
 Underwater rugby under the magnifying glass 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.450
 n 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.970
 Underwater rugby is a team sport they are well-known 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.280
 Bad Beat has little more than the name in common 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.420
 is played with a salt water filled in by his im 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.440
 Compared to fresh water we really are the lighter 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.550
 The band also the people after you can get the basics of rough sport 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.670
 learn 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.740
 So there is simply 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.470
 Duration two large wheels is one under water that means the forest is not where 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.660
 Water be led 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.340
 plays everything under water 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.350
 the second is rugby then that was quite a few of them 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.680
 including maybe quite a few 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.140
 except for a few little things similar to a player who has little ball 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.050
 the player has the dial-in 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.450
 there everything and with that one can do pretty much everything except 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.830
 go to the equipment 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.670
 since his thirteenth year plays on Murray's underwater rugby the 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.700
 Combination of banks and diving promised more then football 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.630
 I just want his behavior to change the only one for me 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.800
 three-dimensional sport 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.220
 In addition, the phone can not only move forward and backward like the 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.040
 Football, especially since you can always need support 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.910
 that of course allows completely different ways of playing 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.120
 especially since only through the fins is a very fast game can be 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.970
 it should be too 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.160
 and around 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.090
 It's just fascinating, it's still up to much 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.890
 which targets necessarily the strongest or waterworks 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.150
 compensate for the speed 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.800
 You hear nothing is not about football that you expect it 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.549
 may or maybe at a patch 1 0 when he was really almost completely calm 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.989
 and just a fascinating world 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.989
 The origins of underwater rugby are in the sixties 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:22.669
 what was initially intended as the main prize quickly became one 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:25.699
 own sport with techniques and tactics 

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:28.679
 such as the cover and dachshund technique 

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:31.549
 It is said once I have watched 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.219
 from a close in front of it 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:36.169
 because I usually have the heads opposite that means he can 

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:39.019
 beautiful the whole field overlook what he actually sees 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.139
 the other one 

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:43.039
 but this has two people in the defense which, of course, much more intense 

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.679
 is 

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:45.349
 Tassilo a Roters 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.760
 but in addition to the tactical skills also plays the physical constitution 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.169
 the player a crucial role 

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:54.930
 only those who have a successful balance between stopping the air and using force 

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:58.369
 Water has a good chance to run this sport successfully 

00:02:58.369 --> 00:03:00.819
 one gives up so reluctantly 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.230
 do not insult that the ball goes in and percent 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.319
 then there was still possible and certain written plan works but then it comes 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:07.019
 not to 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.359
 they want to faint or something else 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.949
 Of course there are also situations where you are being clinched but they are 

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:15.379
 Usually who lets go of the ball in the river 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.150
 and percent if you have the ball Hamas has my easy and good 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.889
 then express my club then you will also immediately let go 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:22.890
 Although lost the ball 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.859
 but some of the more proponents 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:28.719
 So fancy and fast Ortenberg eyes the sport underwater that too 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:31.769
 However, she does have a big disadvantage 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.099
 since this happens four meters deep it remains for spectators 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:38.680
 fourth overall so who says what Webber, I am off to a thorough 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.529
 will be missing for the audience alone 

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:43.479
 So you would have to get into the water 

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:47.299
 Years of new construction which really made all the rehearsals under water 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.459
 or Kurt Wallander is both the video camera is transmitted 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.509
 or have a swimming pool where the writing is taken 

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:55.289
 that or water samples 

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:58.059
 Much more interesting is that unfortunately not for viewers 

00:03:58.059 --> 00:04:01.219
 who would like to get some hope for many pieces is welcome 

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:05.129
 to attend the training on Tuesdays or Thursdays in the Vitusbad
