 in order to misdirect the pathology in agreement with the diabetologist 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.980
 to ensure a high standard the surgeries are equipped with 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.409

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.740

 the dry air for the rear commentary mattresses 

00:01:55.499 --> 00:02:00.379
 believe the use of digital angiography and a coherence tomograph 

00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:01.740
 optics 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.850
 in case of opacity of 8-month media cataract video leave 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.170
 Corneal opacity we use a biska ultrasound 

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:17.059
 the most frequently studied diseases are retinal vasculopathies 

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:20.989
 in particular in particular diabetic retinopathy 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.299
 maculopathies and vitreous retinal interface syndrome eleotti 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.299
 portable costs of a bio-comatosa nature 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.739
 on the basis of data obtained with the imaging by ambulatory imaging of 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.579
 Laser therapy uses a laser for photocoagulation of vasculopathies 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:38.349
 rhythmical 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.349
 especially exclusive besides the queen pacis via of the 

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:46.159
 nokia of the evening and instead mainly indicated in the treatment of 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:50.009
 opacification of the posterior capsule of the crystalline lens after surgery 

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:51.889
 cataract 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:55.949
 cases of glaucoma not disputed with the therapy are also treated 

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:56.899
 medical 

00:02:56.899 --> 00:03:01.279
 with the consulting of the ophthalmology operative unit of the sant'antonio hospital 

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:02.299
 of padua 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.849
 An outpatient cataract surgery service is active 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:11.040
 with the patient, workers are welcomed discharged within a couple of hours 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:16.349
 Interoperative post surgery checks are guaranteed by 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.569
 ophthalmologist in the nursing home 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:26.349
 each patient and under careful clinical assessment is instrumental to the 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:30.029
 order to plan the most suitable surgical technique 

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:34.829
 and for the choice of the most suitable intraocular implant for the individual case 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:41.309
 for this purpose we use ecobiometry and both ultrasound chelasea 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.569
 the intervention only provides topical anesthesia thanks to minimal invasiveness 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:51.180
 it is also possible to operate patients with a non-optimal general situation 

00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:54.129
 without interfering with any therapy 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:58.099
 despite the loss of the intervention the patient is monitored from the point of 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:02.469
 Cardiovascular respiratory sight with anesthetic assistance in cases a 

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:03.639
 risk 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:07.889
 eight hospital chairs with active oxygen dispensers and radio system 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:12.209
 for personalized listening they guarantee a good comfort for the patient in the 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.469
 although a very brief post-intervention stop during which presence is allowed 

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:18.609
 of an escort 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.530
 the clinics as well as the performance of nursing staff in the hall 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.719
 are operative and connected to each other 

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:30.139
 in this way it is possible to monitor the presence of a given patient every moment 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:34.159
 exams such as the same subjected the related reports 

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:38.739
 in addition to anterior segment surgery, operations are performed a 

00:04:38.739 --> 00:04:43.140
 eyelid level with both aesthetic and, therefore, advisory purposes 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.400
 exclusive neoplastic te 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.690
