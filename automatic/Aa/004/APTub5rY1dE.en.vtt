00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.890 
is the under part this is the white
under<00:02:03.520> proto<00:02:03.729> was<00:02:03.850> talking<00:02:04.180> about<00:02:04.390> when<00:02:04.570> I<00:02:04.630> was

under proto was talking about when I was

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.719 
under proto was talking about when I was
telling<00:02:05.500> you<00:02:05.619> that<00:02:05.799> she<00:02:05.830> had<00:02:06.130> like<00:02:06.369> something

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
complaints and honestly I think my only

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.350 
complaints and honestly I think my only
complaint<00:03:03.519> with<00:03:03.880> volks<00:03:04.269> would<00:03:04.540> probably<00:03:04.959> be

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
complaint with volks would probably be

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.870 
complaint with volks would probably be
the<00:03:07.360> weight<00:03:07.600> of<00:03:08.049> their<00:03:08.350> dolls<00:03:08.880> Aiko's

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
the weight of their dolls Aiko's

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.090 
the weight of their dolls Aiko's
probably<00:03:10.239> a<00:03:10.299> good<00:03:10.510> I<00:03:10.810> don't<00:03:11.560> know<00:03:11.620> somebody<00:03:11.980> at

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
probably a good I don't know somebody at

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.860 
probably a good I don't know somebody at
a<00:03:12.190> convention<00:03:12.459> once<00:03:12.850> at<00:03:13.030> ten<00:03:13.209> pounds<00:03:13.630> and<00:03:13.780> I

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
a convention once at ten pounds and I

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.330 
a convention once at ten pounds and I
didn't<00:03:14.170> think<00:03:14.230> that<00:03:14.410> was<00:03:14.500> possible<00:03:14.530> but<00:03:15.070> it

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
didn't think that was possible but it

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.090 
didn't think that was possible but it
might<00:03:15.519> actually<00:03:15.700> be<00:03:16.000> possible<00:03:16.799> but<00:03:17.799> I<00:03:17.860> mean

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
might actually be possible but I mean

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.740 
might actually be possible but I mean
that<00:03:18.310> also<00:03:18.579> means<00:03:18.790> that<00:03:18.910> it's<00:03:19.239> good<00:03:19.420> resin

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
that also means that it's good resin

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.289 
that also means that it's good resin
it's<00:03:19.959> sturdy<00:03:20.340> but<00:03:21.340> at<00:03:21.579> the<00:03:21.670> same<00:03:21.850> time<00:03:22.060> you

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
it's sturdy but at the same time you

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.780 
it's sturdy but at the same time you
know<00:03:22.420> it<00:03:22.570> does<00:03:22.720> kind<00:03:22.959> of<00:03:23.019> suck<00:03:23.549> cuz<00:03:24.549> when<00:03:24.670> I'm

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
know it does kind of suck cuz when I'm

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.039 
know it does kind of suck cuz when I'm
carrying<00:03:25.090> her<00:03:25.209> around<00:03:25.239> at<00:03:25.540> convention<00:03:26.019> she

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
carrying her around at convention she

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.770 
carrying her around at convention she
does<00:03:26.320> get<00:03:26.500> very<00:03:26.560> heavy<00:03:27.070> very<00:03:27.160> fast<00:03:27.760> so<00:03:28.540> there

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
does get very heavy very fast so there

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.060 
does get very heavy very fast so there
are<00:03:28.810> a<00:03:28.870> lot<00:03:29.019> of<00:03:29.049> times<00:03:29.290> where<00:03:29.470> I'm<00:03:29.530> just<00:03:29.560> like<00:03:29.829> I

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
are a lot of times where I'm just like I

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.810 
are a lot of times where I'm just like I
just<00:03:30.700> don't<00:03:30.910> feel<00:03:30.970> like<00:03:31.150> taking<00:03:31.450> her<00:03:31.950> so<00:03:32.950> uh

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
just don't feel like taking her so uh

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.599 
just don't feel like taking her so uh
complaints<00:03:34.780> not<00:03:35.049> really<00:03:35.440> besides<00:03:35.769> the<00:03:36.250> price

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
complaints not really besides the price

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:38.490 
complaints not really besides the price
but<00:03:37.030> it's<00:03:37.239> folks<00:03:37.510> I<00:03:37.780> think<00:03:37.810> they<00:03:38.079> kind<00:03:38.230> of<00:03:38.350> have

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
but it's folks I think they kind of have

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.960 
but it's folks I think they kind of have
the<00:03:38.620> right<00:03:38.799> to<00:03:39.010> do<00:03:39.100> that<00:03:39.130> and<00:03:39.519> it's<00:03:39.730> a<00:03:39.820> doll

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
the right to do that and it's a doll

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.460 
the right to do that and it's a doll
company<00:03:40.209> so<00:03:40.600> I<00:03:40.660> mean<00:03:40.840> it's<00:03:40.989> not<00:03:41.109> really

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
company so I mean it's not really

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.349 
company so I mean it's not really
although<00:03:42.100> all<00:03:42.370> companies<00:03:42.730> are<00:03:42.850> pricey<00:03:43.060> but<00:03:43.299> I

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
although all companies are pricey but I

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:45.569 
although all companies are pricey but I
think<00:03:43.600> folks<00:03:43.810> might<00:03:44.140> have<00:03:44.950> the<00:03:45.130> right<00:03:45.280> to<00:03:45.430> be<00:03:45.549> a

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
think folks might have the right to be a

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.110 
think folks might have the right to be a
