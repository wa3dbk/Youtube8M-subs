00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
cool-down rate relic so let's just cut

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.320 
cool-down rate relic so let's just cut
to<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:21.960> chase<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.260> do<00:00:22.529> this<00:00:22.650> real<00:00:22.859> quick<00:00:26.330> now

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
to the chase and do this real quick now

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.820 
to the chase and do this real quick now
it<00:00:27.390> doesn't<00:00:27.510> take<00:00:27.689> too<00:00:27.900> long<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.080> get<00:00:28.260> there

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
it doesn't take too long to get there

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.830 
it doesn't take too long to get there
the<00:00:29.189> whole<00:00:29.340> thing<00:00:29.580> takes<00:00:30.000> maybe<00:00:30.330> about<00:00:30.599> two

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
the whole thing takes maybe about two

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.900 
the whole thing takes maybe about two
minutes<00:00:31.160> it's<00:00:32.160> probably<00:00:32.399> gonna<00:00:32.489> take<00:00:32.579> more

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
minutes it's probably gonna take more

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.900 
minutes it's probably gonna take more
further<00:00:33.180> classes<00:00:33.950> but<00:00:34.950> if<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.430> using<00:00:35.550> south

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
further classes but if you using south

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.530 
further classes but if you using south
shouldn't<00:00:36.329> take<00:00:36.450> too<00:00:36.480> long

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.670 

first<00:00:42.540> thing<00:00:42.629> you're<00:00:42.690> gonna<00:00:42.809> come<00:00:43.020> across<00:00:43.140> is

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
first thing you're gonna come across is

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.470 
first thing you're gonna come across is
usually<00:00:44.070> there's<00:00:44.280> three<00:00:44.550> Skaggs<00:00:44.910> here<00:00:45.300> I

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
usually there's three Skaggs here I

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.729 
usually there's three Skaggs here I
might<00:00:45.719> want<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:45.930> deal<00:00:46.079> with<00:00:46.200> them<00:00:46.350> real<00:00:46.469> quick

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
might want to deal with them real quick

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.319 
might want to deal with them real quick
so<00:00:46.920> they<00:00:47.010> don't<00:00:47.190> follow<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.579> down<00:00:47.730> into<00:00:48.210> the

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
so they don't follow you down into the

00:00:48.329 --> 00:01:13.940 
so they don't follow you down into the
boss<00:00:48.510> area<00:01:04.339> easy<00:01:05.339> enough

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.649 

now<00:01:14.580> when<00:01:14.700> you're<00:01:14.790> putting<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.180> boss<00:01:15.390> you

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
now when you're putting this boss you

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.600 
now when you're putting this boss you
want<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.900> stay<00:01:16.110> behind<00:01:16.409> this<00:01:16.590> area<00:01:17.159> right<00:01:17.580> here

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
want to stay behind this area right here

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.560 
want to stay behind this area right here
pretty<00:01:20.610> much<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.970> can't<00:01:21.180> hit<00:01:21.300> you<00:01:21.420> right

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
pretty much you can't hit you right

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.969 
pretty much you can't hit you right
there<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.810> it's<00:01:22.050> a<00:01:22.110> good<00:01:22.290> place<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.500> hang<00:01:22.800> out

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
there and it's a good place to hang out

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.890 
there and it's a good place to hang out
every<00:01:23.760> so<00:01:24.000> often<00:01:24.180> she'll<00:01:24.479> hit<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.690> with<00:01:24.780> an

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
every so often she'll hit you with an

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.899 
every so often she'll hit you with an
electric<00:01:25.260> ball<00:01:25.440> but<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.280> wouldn't<00:01:26.670> worry<00:01:26.790> about

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
electric ball but I wouldn't worry about

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:35.080 
electric ball but I wouldn't worry about
it<00:01:27.150> too<00:01:27.240> much<00:01:30.619> all<00:01:31.619> right<00:01:31.650> here<00:01:31.890> we<00:01:31.979> go

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.310 

now<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.150> really<00:01:36.390> just<00:01:36.630> want<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.840> try<00:01:37.050> to<00:01:37.110> hit

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
now you really just want to try to hit

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.460 
now you really just want to try to hit
her<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.560> head<00:01:41.479> like<00:01:42.479> every<00:01:42.750> scag<00:01:43.050> that's<00:01:43.350> a

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
her in the head like every scag that's a

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.730 
her in the head like every scag that's a
weak<00:01:43.650> point

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.560 

now<00:01:47.250> all<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.550> time<00:01:47.730> she'll<00:01:47.970> start<00:01:48.210> off<00:01:48.360> with

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
now all the time she'll start off with

00:01:48.570 --> 00:02:09.850 
now all the time she'll start off with
the<00:01:48.720> electric<00:01:49.080> falls<00:01:49.320> but<00:01:49.710> whatever

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.260 

and<00:02:10.370> sometimes<00:02:10.700> she'll<00:02:10.880> go<00:02:10.970> up<00:02:11.030> to<00:02:11.150> the

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
and sometimes she'll go up to the

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:31.170 
and sometimes she'll go up to the
bandits<00:02:11.680> so<00:02:12.680> that's<00:02:12.830> always<00:02:12.980> helpful<00:02:13.280> as<00:02:13.490> well

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.280 

and<00:02:32.180> that's<00:02:32.540> it<00:02:34.629> usually<00:02:35.629> she<00:02:35.780> dropped<00:02:36.049> some

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
and that's it usually she dropped some

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.250 
and that's it usually she dropped some
purples<00:02:36.950> and<00:02:37.159> blues<00:02:37.250> and<00:02:37.760> greens<00:02:38.079> I've<00:02:39.079> never

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
purples and blues and greens I've never

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.890 
purples and blues and greens I've never
had<00:02:39.469> her<00:02:39.560> drop<00:02:39.799> an<00:02:39.920> orange<00:02:40.219> weapon<00:02:40.750> but<00:02:41.750> she

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
had her drop an orange weapon but she

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.170 
had her drop an orange weapon but she
always<00:02:42.109> drops<00:02:42.379> iridium<00:02:44.049> nice<00:02:45.609> but<00:02:46.609> uh<00:02:46.639> yeah

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
always drops iridium nice but uh yeah

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.910 
always drops iridium nice but uh yeah
that's<00:02:47.359> it<00:02:47.629> easy<00:02:47.989> enough<00:02:49.870> like<00:02:50.870> I<00:02:50.959> said<00:02:51.230> it's

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
that's it easy enough like I said it's

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.429 
that's it easy enough like I said it's
probably<00:02:52.069> easier<00:02:52.549> with<00:02:52.670> Sal<00:02:52.989> but<00:02:53.989> pretty<00:02:54.290> much

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:54.439 
probably easier with Sal but pretty much

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:56.649 
probably easier with Sal but pretty much
the<00:02:54.709> whole<00:02:54.889> trick<00:02:55.700> to<00:02:55.730> it<00:02:56.030> it's<00:02:56.209> just<00:02:56.389> to<00:02:56.480> stay

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:56.659 
the whole trick to it it's just to stay

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:58.869 
the whole trick to it it's just to stay
behind<00:02:56.810> this<00:02:57.139> area<00:02:57.409> right<00:02:57.680> here<00:02:57.739> and<00:02:58.579> pretty

00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:58.879
