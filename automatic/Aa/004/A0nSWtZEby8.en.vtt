00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
which you're showing then upside down

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.949 
which you're showing then upside down
stair<00:02:37.110> one<00:02:37.830> block<00:02:38.040> up<00:02:38.280> or<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:39.150> third<00:02:39.480> block<00:02:39.689> up

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
stair one block up or the third block up

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.190 
stair one block up or the third block up
from<00:02:40.549> the<00:02:41.549> floor<00:02:41.819> going<00:02:42.779> all<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.019> way<00:02:43.049> around

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
from the floor going all the way around

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.649 
from the floor going all the way around
like<00:02:43.680> so<00:02:44.219> so<00:02:44.549> it's<00:02:44.700> kind<00:02:44.879> of<00:02:44.939> mirrored

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
like so so it's kind of mirrored

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:48.449 
like so so it's kind of mirrored
we<00:02:46.659> they<00:02:46.780> want<00:02:46.930> to<00:02:46.989> place<00:02:47.170> a<00:02:47.349> fence<00:02:47.680> on<00:02:47.980> top<00:02:48.280> of

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
we they want to place a fence on top of

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.709 
we they want to place a fence on top of
each<00:02:48.640> of<00:02:48.819> those<00:02:48.969> stairs<00:02:49.469> going<00:02:50.469> around<00:02:51.719> like

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:52.719 
each of those stairs going around like

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:57.539 
each of those stairs going around like
so<00:02:54.269> we<00:02:55.269> then<00:02:55.480> take<00:02:55.659> Red<00:02:56.230> Bull<00:02:56.409> or<00:02:56.709> whatever

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
so we then take Red Bull or whatever

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.459 
so we then take Red Bull or whatever
we'll<00:02:57.790> color<00:02:58.239> you<00:02:58.420> want<00:02:58.540> to<00:02:58.599> use<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:59.560> go<00:03:00.299> one

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:01.469 
we'll color you want to use and go one

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:06.119 
we'll color you want to use and go one
one-up<00:03:02.469> one-up<00:03:02.739> one-up<00:03:03.730> and<00:03:04.739> then<00:03:05.739> bring<00:03:06.010> it

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129 
one-up one-up one-up and then bring it

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:09.119 
one-up one-up one-up and then bring it
back<00:03:06.159> down<00:03:07.049> until<00:03:08.049> you<00:03:08.409> reach<00:03:08.439> the<00:03:08.920> fence

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
back down until you reach the fence

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:15.569 
back down until you reach the fence
again<00:03:10.500> do<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:11.650> same<00:03:11.889> going<00:03:12.189> round<00:03:13.060> so<00:03:13.540> we<00:03:14.579> have

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
again do the same going round so we have

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:24.059 
again do the same going round so we have
a<00:03:17.430> variation<00:03:18.430> in<00:03:18.489> height<00:03:18.730> here<00:03:20.819> once<00:03:21.819> again<00:03:23.069> at

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
a variation in height here once again at

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.250 
a variation in height here once again at
the<00:03:24.220> same<00:03:24.430> height<00:03:24.689> going<00:03:25.689> along<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:26.049> five

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
the same height going along the five

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.240 
the same height going along the five
block<00:03:26.590> and<00:03:27.569> then<00:03:28.569> a<00:03:29.370> variation<00:03:30.370> in<00:03:30.489> height

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
block and then a variation in height

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.830 
block and then a variation in height
here<00:03:33.250> as<00:03:33.669> well<00:03:34.469> we<00:03:35.469> can<00:03:35.620> then<00:03:35.709> take<00:03:35.859> white<00:03:36.159> wool

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
here as well we can then take white wool

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.770 
here as well we can then take white wool
and<00:03:37.840> we<00:03:37.989> just<00:03:38.200> start<00:03:38.409> basically<00:03:39.569> layering<00:03:40.569> it

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
and we just start basically layering it

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.470 
and we just start basically layering it
and<00:03:41.019> going<00:03:41.560> round<00:03:43.620> on<00:03:44.620> each<00:03:45.069> of<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.939> wool<00:03:46.150> and

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
and going round on each of the wool and

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.979 
and going round on each of the wool and
the<00:03:46.959> red<00:03:47.139> wall<00:03:48.000> then<00:03:49.000> take<00:03:49.269> your<00:03:49.419> colored<00:03:49.750> wool

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
the red wall then take your colored wool

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.839 
the red wall then take your colored wool
again<00:03:51.840> do<00:03:52.840> the<00:03:52.959> same<00:03:53.370> bringing<00:03:54.370> it<00:03:54.459> closing

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
again do the same bringing it closing

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:58.740 
again do the same bringing it closing
closer<00:03:55.090> in<00:03:55.359> before<00:03:55.959> we<00:03:56.049> can<00:03:56.199> have<00:03:56.669> final<00:03:57.750> three

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
closer in before we can have final three

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.890 
closer in before we can have final three
white<00:03:58.959> wool<00:03:59.909> then<00:04:00.909> on<00:04:01.090> the<00:04:01.180> five<00:04:01.359> o'clock<00:04:01.569> ends

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
white wool then on the five o'clock ends

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.610 
white wool then on the five o'clock ends
you<00:04:01.959> want<00:04:02.109> to<00:04:02.169> go<00:04:02.260> one<00:04:02.500> two<00:04:02.799> three<00:04:02.829> four<00:04:03.579> five

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
you want to go one two three four five

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.080 
you want to go one two three four five
one<00:04:05.620> two<00:04:05.680> three<00:04:06.540> then<00:04:07.540> one<00:04:08.069> on<00:04:09.069> three<00:04:09.790> blocks

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
one two three then one on three blocks

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:20.550 
one two three then one on three blocks
from<00:04:10.150> 0<00:04:10.449> 1<00:04:10.599> 2<00:04:10.750> 3<00:04:10.930> 1<00:04:11.620> 1<00:04:12.449> 2<00:04:13.449> 3<00:04:13.479> 4<00:04:14.049> 5<00:04:14.379> 1<00:04:15.340> 2<00:04:15.400> 3<00:04:16.049> 1<00:04:17.459> 1<00:04:18.459> 2<00:04:18.519> 3<00:04:19.560> 1

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
from 0 1 2 3 1 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 1 1 2 3 1

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.300 
from 0 1 2 3 1 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 1 1 2 3 1
and<00:04:20.799> then<00:04:21.699> we<00:04:21.789> have<00:04:22.000> the<00:04:22.360> rooftop<00:04:22.870> done<00:04:23.310> okay

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
and then we have the rooftop done okay

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.770 
and then we have the rooftop done okay
so<00:04:24.370> the<00:04:24.550> last<00:04:24.729> thing<00:04:24.820> we<00:04:24.940> want<00:04:25.060> to<00:04:25.090> do<00:04:25.240> is<00:04:25.479> do

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
so the last thing we want to do is do

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.450 
so the last thing we want to do is do
the<00:04:25.930> framing<00:04:26.530> for<00:04:26.560> the<00:04:26.770> roof<00:04:26.979> so<00:04:27.250> we're<00:04:27.370> on<00:04:27.430> a

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
the framing for the roof so we're on a

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.890 
the framing for the roof so we're on a
go<00:04:27.669> 1<00:04:27.970> 2<00:04:28.389> 3<00:04:29.080> 4<00:04:29.680> 5<00:04:30.250> with<00:04:30.639> logs<00:04:30.909> in<00:04:31.120> the<00:04:31.180> 5<00:04:31.360> section

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
go 1 2 3 4 5 with logs in the 5 section

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.620 
go 1 2 3 4 5 with logs in the 5 section
and<00:04:32.130> upside<00:04:33.130> down<00:04:33.220> set<00:04:33.490> up<00:04:33.639> side<00:04:33.849> down<00:04:33.880> stir<00:04:34.300> or

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
and upside down set up side down stir or

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.990 
and upside down set up side down stir or
so<00:04:34.810> down<00:04:34.960> to<00:04:35.110> the<00:04:35.199> upside<00:04:35.620> down<00:04:35.860> stare<00:04:36.190> a<00:04:36.659> slab

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
so down to the upside down stare a slab

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.689 
so down to the upside down stare a slab
then<00:04:40.000> on<00:04:40.180> 3<00:04:40.449> sections<00:04:40.900> do<00:04:41.199> the<00:04:41.320> same<00:04:41.560> put<00:04:42.550> with

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699 
then on 3 sections do the same put with

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.260 
then on 3 sections do the same put with
only<00:04:42.880> 3<00:04:43.240> blocks<00:04:43.360> instead<00:04:43.900> of<00:04:44.250> d5<00:04:45.250> so<00:04:46.060> we<00:04:46.150> have

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
only 3 blocks instead of d5 so we have

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.920 
only 3 blocks instead of d5 so we have
that<00:04:46.389> so<00:04:46.659> pattern<00:04:47.050> and<00:04:47.789> then<00:04:48.789> just<00:04:49.360> finish<00:04:49.570> off

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
that so pattern and then just finish off

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.909 
that so pattern and then just finish off
the<00:04:50.680> other<00:04:50.710> two<00:04:50.889> sections

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:05:00.920 

so<00:04:54.520> we<00:04:54.639> can<00:04:54.789> finally<00:04:55.030> complete<00:04:55.599> our<00:04:57.030> store

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.890 

there<00:05:01.930> we<00:05:01.990> go<00:05:02.110> and<00:05:02.349> we're<00:05:02.529> all<00:05:02.620> finished<00:05:02.860> so

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
there we go and we're all finished so

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.119 
there we go and we're all finished so
there<00:05:04.900> is<00:05:05.050> actually<00:05:05.199> more<00:05:05.499> shapes<00:05:05.740> you<00:05:05.860> can<00:05:06.009> do

00:05:06.119 --> 00:05:06.129 
there is actually more shapes you can do

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:07.800 
there is actually more shapes you can do
