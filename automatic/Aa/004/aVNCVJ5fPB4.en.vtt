00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:12.049
 and now here the game 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.530
 I know if the analysis here of the new trailer 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:17.390
 Good luck, first let's see the 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.039
 trailer for later I show my 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.340
 beauty conclusions 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.340
 went 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.599
 a good man 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.099
 My first review was 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.870
 of uniform fabrics 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.300
 it seems to be silly but if you 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.760
 repair will notice a good improvement 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.350
 after that, players of the 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.970
 bayern of munich and saints 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.400
 janice it is possible to notice a great 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.950
 improvement of the graphics not only of 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.480
 players and yes all stadium lawn 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.730
 ball and crowd 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.600
 speaking crowd is also notable for 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.569
 your presence 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.560
 shouting the name of the team then with the 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.300
 rolling ball 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.750
 I noticed a great quality of the new 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.970
 engine of the new 2014 foot that will be the 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.299
 same used in metal gear solid 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.790
 grooves and defendants who fox and shine 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:06.530
 brought that brought a large a large 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.930
 realism players who now 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.640
 moved more naturally and taking 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.980
 better bases of kicks and 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.470
 mainly dribbling and marking 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.410
 before in the foot 2013 you had players 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.420
 so more locked now in Brazil and 14 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.830
 you notice with this new gameplay 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.010
 you notice the movements of the arms 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.440
 them the marking and etc. 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.670
 is this possible to note when the 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.040
 neighborhood player 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.079
 the neighborhood player derives the 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.010
 saints and also in several other scenes 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:36.200
 from the trailer 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.880
 the marking and resistance system 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.620
 it seems that it has also been improved 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.720
 now the player can play better 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.519
 ball to both sides of the 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.470
 defender or striker that is 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:47.600
 clearly remarkable when it came from the 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.820
 Bayern Munich will try on the ball bar 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.480
 but is prevented by its 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:56.390
 persistence and manages to circumvent the 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:01.100
 nor in this case can the montillo carry the 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:03.829
 free and plays are also celebrations 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.959
 after we see the goalkeeper coming out of the 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:08.510
 Gol, it was a fact that happened 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.940
 few times that I remember the weight 13 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.190
 and a little more about the dribbles and the 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.290
 new tactics take down the ball as we see 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.549
 three players closing a player of the 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.739
 huh saints 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.880
 a more realistic gravity when 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.490
 touch over 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:26.690
 for the bayern player and that's a good 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:30.009
 finally to after that to 116 with a goal 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.210
 who goes there he made the goal 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:33.279
 I do not know if it was the most beautiful goal. 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.360
 year I can not remember but it was a 

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:35.979
 neymar is difficult on top of Flemish 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.110
 I think you should have seen it already. 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.909
 an image that is a part of the rail that 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.860
 the finale it seems that in my 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:43.059
 opinion was very similar to that of 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.499
 Neymar, I do not know if this was 

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:47.409
 purposely 

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:49.930
 well anyway this was my review 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:51.639
 about the trailer is from pesm 14 I hope that 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.990
 You liked it if you liked me. 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:54.759
 I wanted you to do one like the 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.460
 favorite to help in the repercussion of 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:05:00.099
 video and sign up for the channel is 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.149
 Do not miss any video on request 2013 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:04.059
 2014 

00:05:01.149 --> 00:05:05.889
 fifa 13 1 also fifa 14 or any 

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:08.909
 another game you make in beauty 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.909
 so this is it
