today's our journal page is an

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.010 
today's our journal page is an
experiment<00:00:05.040> on<00:00:05.250> color<00:00:05.700> mixing<00:00:06.240> for<00:00:06.839> this

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
experiment on color mixing for this

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.480 
experiment on color mixing for this
experiment<00:00:07.589> you're<00:00:07.710> only<00:00:07.950> going<00:00:08.189> to<00:00:08.340> need

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
experiment you're only going to need

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.910 
experiment you're only going to need
some<00:00:08.700> tubes<00:00:09.240> of<00:00:09.480> watercolor<00:00:10.019> some<00:00:10.679> paint

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
some tubes of watercolor some paint

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.919 
some tubes of watercolor some paint
brushes<00:00:11.160> and<00:00:11.490> your<00:00:12.120> mixed<00:00:12.450> media<00:00:12.750> paper

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
brushes and your mixed media paper

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.720 
brushes and your mixed media paper
sketch<00:00:13.320> book<00:00:13.559> you<00:00:14.009> could<00:00:14.130> also<00:00:14.340> use

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
sketch book you could also use

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.300 
sketch book you could also use
watercolor<00:00:15.360> paper<00:00:15.660> so<00:00:15.990> let's<00:00:16.859> first<00:00:17.070> take<00:00:17.250> a

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
watercolor paper so let's first take a

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.769 
watercolor paper so let's first take a
look<00:00:17.520> at<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:18.000> finished<00:00:18.330> ones<00:00:18.510> I<00:00:18.630> have<00:00:18.750> here

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
look at the finished ones I have here

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.380 
look at the finished ones I have here
you<00:00:19.529> can<00:00:19.560> see<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:20.220> these<00:00:20.400> are<00:00:20.460> just<00:00:20.970> simple

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
you can see that these are just simple

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.060 
you can see that these are just simple
leaf<00:00:21.630> shapes<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.260> I've<00:00:22.619> gone<00:00:22.800> ahead<00:00:22.859> and

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
leaf shapes and I've gone ahead and

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.679 
leaf shapes and I've gone ahead and
colored<00:00:23.490> them<00:00:23.609> in<00:00:23.699> with<00:00:24.090> two<00:00:24.390> different

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
colored them in with two different

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.750 
colored them in with two different
colors<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:24.990> watercolor<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.859> then<00:00:26.460> in<00:00:26.640> the

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
colors of watercolor and then in the

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.150 
colors of watercolor and then in the
middle<00:00:27.060> we<00:00:27.269> get<00:00:27.660> our<00:00:27.980> experiment<00:00:28.980> which<00:00:29.130> is

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
middle we get our experiment which is

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.859 
middle we get our experiment which is
what<00:00:29.550> happens<00:00:29.849> when<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.150> put<00:00:30.420> two<00:00:30.570> colors

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
what happens when you put two colors

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.310 
what happens when you put two colors
together<00:00:31.080> so<00:00:32.300> let's<00:00:33.300> open<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.660> up<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:33.989> page

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
together so let's open it up to a page

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.040 
together so let's open it up to a page
and<00:00:34.649> you<00:00:35.219> can<00:00:35.370> draw<00:00:35.579> any<00:00:35.880> sort<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.329> shapes<00:00:36.630> to

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
and you can draw any sort of shapes to

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.979 
and you can draw any sort of shapes to
do<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.290> but<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.620> like<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:38.010> draw<00:00:38.780> leaves<00:00:39.780> are

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
do this but I like to draw leaves are

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.270 
do this but I like to draw leaves are
some<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.290> my<00:00:40.320> favorite<00:00:40.739> things<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.010> draw

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
some of my favorite things to draw

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.940 
some of my favorite things to draw
because<00:00:41.460> they<00:00:41.820> can<00:00:41.969> be<00:00:42.149> any<00:00:42.360> shape<00:00:42.770> so<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:43.800> can

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
because they can be any shape so you can

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.720 
because they can be any shape so you can
lightly<00:00:44.930> draw<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:46.230> couple<00:00:46.440> leaf<00:00:46.770> shapes<00:00:49.730> and

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
lightly draw a couple leaf shapes and

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.020 
lightly draw a couple leaf shapes and
let<00:00:51.690> me<00:00:51.809> turn<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.530> page<00:00:52.800> where<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.520> have<00:00:53.760> some

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
let me turn the page where I have some

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.420 
let me turn the page where I have some
already<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:55.050> can<00:00:55.199> see<00:00:55.410> on<00:00:55.559> these<00:00:55.770> that

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
already and you can see on these that

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.610 
already and you can see on these that
I've<00:00:56.699> split<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.840> leaf<00:00:58.050> down<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.559> center<00:00:59.300> with

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
I've split the leaf down the center with

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.650 
I've split the leaf down the center with
my<00:01:01.620> pencil<00:01:01.859> as<00:01:02.100> well<00:01:02.370> now<00:01:02.940> I've<00:01:03.270> gone<00:01:03.480> ahead

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
my pencil as well now I've gone ahead

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.260 
my pencil as well now I've gone ahead
and<00:01:03.809> put<00:01:04.680> out<00:01:04.860> some<00:01:05.159> colors<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.850> paint<00:01:06.060> on<00:01:06.240> our

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
and put out some colors of paint on our

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.810 
and put out some colors of paint on our
palette<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.830> reason<00:01:08.100> I'm<00:01:08.220> using<00:01:08.250> two

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
palette and the reason I'm using two

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.960 
palette and the reason I'm using two
watercolors<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.900> because<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:11.549> color<00:01:11.760> is

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
watercolors is because the the color is

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.630 
watercolors is because the the color is
actually<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:12.630> much<00:01:12.810> more<00:01:13.140> concentrated<00:01:14.070> and

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
actually so much more concentrated and

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.320 
actually so much more concentrated and
brighter<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:16.189> that's<00:01:17.189> why<00:01:17.430> I'm<00:01:17.580> using<00:01:17.820> two

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
brighter so that's why I'm using two

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.480 
brighter so that's why I'm using two
watercolors<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.860> we're<00:01:20.070> gonna<00:01:20.189> start

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
watercolors so that we're gonna start

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.890 
watercolors so that we're gonna start
with<00:01:20.610> our<00:01:20.759> lighter<00:01:21.030> color<00:01:21.390> here<00:01:22.670> and<00:01:23.869> I'm<00:01:24.869> just

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
with our lighter color here and I'm just

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.719 
with our lighter color here and I'm just
mixing<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.740> little<00:01:26.040> bit<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.369> can<00:01:26.400> mix

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
mixing it a little bit and you can mix

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.819 
mixing it a little bit and you can mix
it<00:01:26.850> on<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.000> separate<00:01:27.420> area<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:28.229> your<00:01:28.409> palette

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
it on a separate area of your palette

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.580 
it on a separate area of your palette
and<00:01:29.009> then<00:01:29.490> you're<00:01:29.670> gonna<00:01:29.759> paint<00:01:30.119> one<00:01:30.930> side<00:01:30.960> of

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
and then you're gonna paint one side of

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.490 
and then you're gonna paint one side of
your<00:01:31.770> leaf<00:01:32.270> with<00:01:33.270> this<00:01:33.509> super<00:01:33.960> bright

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
your leaf with this super bright

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.969 
your leaf with this super bright
watercolor<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:36.170> for<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:37.290> part<00:01:37.680> we're

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
watercolor and for this part we're

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.999 
watercolor and for this part we're
actually<00:01:38.159> going<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:39.380> I'll<00:01:40.380> just<00:01:40.409> keep<00:01:40.770> adding

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
actually going to I'll just keep adding

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.380 
actually going to I'll just keep adding
and<00:01:41.280> mixing<00:01:41.460> water<00:01:41.820> but<00:01:42.119> we're<00:01:42.240> actually

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
and mixing water but we're actually

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.880 
and mixing water but we're actually
gonna<00:01:42.630> paint<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.020> center<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.500> leaf<00:01:43.649> as

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
gonna paint the center of the leaf as

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.910 
gonna paint the center of the leaf as
well<00:01:45.200> and<00:01:46.200> I'm<00:01:46.740> gonna<00:01:46.829> turn<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.310> page<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:48.920> I

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
well and I'm gonna turn the page and I

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.499 
well and I'm gonna turn the page and I
have<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.070> nice<00:01:50.250> even<00:01:50.579> coat<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.000> I've<00:01:51.299> got<00:01:51.479> a

have a nice even coat and I've got a
couple<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:51.990> I've<00:01:52.140> been<00:01:52.259> working<00:01:52.470> on<00:01:52.740> got<00:01:52.979> a

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
couple that I've been working on got a

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.310 
couple that I've been working on got a
red<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.549> yellow<00:01:53.579> here<00:01:54.030> so<00:01:54.600> let's<00:01:54.810> rinse<00:01:55.110> out

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
red and a yellow here so let's rinse out

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.170 
red and a yellow here so let's rinse out
the<00:01:55.350> brush<00:01:55.649> entirely<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:57.799> add<00:01:58.799> some<00:01:59.189> blue<00:01:59.610> to

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
the brush entirely and add some blue to

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.959 
the brush entirely and add some blue to
our<00:02:00.299> yellow<00:02:00.600> leaf<00:02:00.899> down<00:02:01.140> here<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.969> it's

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969
