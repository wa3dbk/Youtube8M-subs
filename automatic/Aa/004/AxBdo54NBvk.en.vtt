00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
hey it's meta again today I just wanted

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.690 
hey it's meta again today I just wanted
to<00:00:04.020> go<00:00:04.170> over<00:00:04.200> really<00:00:04.620> quickly<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.339> different

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
to go over really quickly the different

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.030 
to go over really quickly the different
levels<00:00:06.120> of<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:06.569> Nioxin<00:00:06.930> system<00:00:07.620> because

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
levels of the Nioxin system because

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.310 
levels of the Nioxin system because
there's<00:00:08.760> multiple<00:00:09.480> different<00:00:09.510> systems

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
there's multiple different systems

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.669 
there's multiple different systems
within<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.980> shampoo<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:12.210> conditioner<00:00:12.679> so

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
within the shampoo and conditioner so

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.930 
within the shampoo and conditioner so
and<00:00:14.130> I<00:00:14.580> had<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:14.820> couple<00:00:15.299> questions<00:00:15.509> on<00:00:15.990> that<00:00:16.170> so

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:16.940 
and I had a couple questions on that so

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.240 
and I had a couple questions on that so
there's<00:00:17.940> eight<00:00:18.150> different<00:00:18.289> levels<00:00:19.289> or

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
there's eight different levels or

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.349 
there's eight different levels or
systems<00:00:20.939> actually<00:00:21.420> they<00:00:21.570> call<00:00:21.810> it<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:23.090> it<00:00:24.090> goes

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
systems actually they call it so it goes

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.060 
systems actually they call it so it goes
one<00:00:25.080> into<00:00:25.560> our<00:00:26.420> thin<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:28.050> fine<00:00:28.380> hair<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:29.039> only

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
one into our thin and fine hair the only

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.389 
one into our thin and fine hair the only
difference<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.510> level<00:00:31.320> two<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.890> little

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
difference is that level two is a little

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.000 
difference is that level two is a little
bit<00:00:32.579> stronger<00:00:32.910> than<00:00:33.059> level<00:00:33.570> one<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.050> that

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
bit stronger than level one and that

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.310 
bit stronger than level one and that
level<00:00:35.250> two<00:00:35.640> has<00:00:35.820> SPF<00:00:36.300> in<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:37.110> has<00:00:37.290> a

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
level two has SPF in it so it has a

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.160 
level two has SPF in it so it has a
certain<00:00:37.649> coating<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.750> protects<00:00:39.750> your<00:00:39.899> hair

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
certain coating that protects your hair

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.470 
certain coating that protects your hair
the<00:00:41.010> only<00:00:41.040> side<00:00:41.489> effect<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.360> it

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
the only side effect of that is that it

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.020 
the only side effect of that is that it
can<00:00:42.510> cause<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:42.930> little<00:00:43.320> bit<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.710> itching<00:00:44.100> then

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
can cause a little bit of itching then

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.029 
can cause a little bit of itching then
it<00:00:45.149> goes<00:00:45.270> on<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.600> level<00:00:45.780> three<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.379> four

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
it goes on to level three and four

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.310 
it goes on to level three and four
that's<00:00:47.219> for<00:00:47.520> chemically<00:00:48.030> treated<00:00:48.570> hair<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:49.230> if

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
that's for chemically treated hair so if

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.080 
that's for chemically treated hair so if
you've<00:00:49.469> dyed<00:00:49.770> your<00:00:50.010> hair<00:00:50.070> had<00:00:50.610> any<00:00:50.820> treatment

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
you've dyed your hair had any treatment

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.860 
you've dyed your hair had any treatment
on<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.449> like<00:00:51.890> Brazilian<00:00:52.890> Blowout<00:00:53.280> or<00:00:53.870> if

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
on it like Brazilian Blowout or if

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.310 
on it like Brazilian Blowout or if
you've<00:00:55.079> done<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.379> Japanese<00:00:55.890> system<00:00:57.320> those

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
you've done the Japanese system those

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.279 
you've done the Japanese system those
should<00:00:59.010> be<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.160> levels<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.760> you're<00:00:59.969> using

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
should be the levels that you're using

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.880 
should be the levels that you're using
three<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.590> again<00:01:02.960> like<00:01:03.960> levels<00:01:04.470> one<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.710> two

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
three is again like levels one and two

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.679 
three is again like levels one and two
in<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.939> know<00:01:06.060> three<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.540> little

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
in that you know three is a little

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.080 
in that you know three is a little
weaker<00:01:07.080> than<00:01:07.229> four<00:01:07.560> four<00:01:07.920> has<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.340> SPF<00:01:08.880> in<00:01:09.060> it

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
weaker than four four has the SPF in it

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.990 
weaker than four four has the SPF in it
so<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.409> still<00:01:10.470> have<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:10.920> little<00:01:11.340> bit<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.700> hair

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
so you still have a little bit of hair

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.380 
so you still have a little bit of hair
loss<00:01:12.210> use<00:01:13.200> level<00:01:13.619> three<00:01:13.830> if<00:01:14.040> it's<00:01:14.250> more<00:01:15.119> than

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
loss use level three if it's more than

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.160 
loss use level three if it's more than
you<00:01:16.259> use<00:01:16.560> level<00:01:16.979> four<00:01:17.330> so<00:01:18.330> levels<00:01:18.900> one<00:01:19.140> through

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
you use level four so levels one through

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.670 
you use level four so levels one through
four<00:01:19.710> are<00:01:20.009> all<00:01:20.430> for<00:01:20.729> fine<00:01:21.060> hair<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.780> it's<00:01:22.500> when

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
four are all for fine hair so it's when

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.520 
four are all for fine hair so it's when
the<00:01:22.799> strands<00:01:23.280> are<00:01:23.670> fine<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.360> thinning<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.439> I

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
the strands are fine and thinning and I

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.679 
the strands are fine and thinning and I
have<00:01:25.740> fine<00:01:26.070> hair<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.670> picked<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.119> level<00:01:27.450> two

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
have fine hair so I picked the level two

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.980 
have fine hair so I picked the level two
because<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.710> have<00:01:29.009> moderate<00:01:29.520> hair<00:01:29.850> loss<00:01:30.090> that

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
because I have moderate hair loss that

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.980 
because I have moderate hair loss that
is<00:01:31.320> not<00:01:31.530> chemically<00:01:32.070> treated<00:01:32.659> then<00:01:33.659> when<00:01:33.869> you

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
is not chemically treated then when you

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.520 
is not chemically treated then when you
move<00:01:34.140> on<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.500> level<00:01:34.829> 5<00:01:35.630> level<00:01:36.630> five<00:01:37.140> is

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
move on to level 5 level five is

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.840 
move on to level 5 level five is
different<00:01:38.990> because<00:01:39.990> that's<00:01:40.860> for<00:01:41.280> medium<00:01:41.759> and

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
different because that's for medium and

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.300 
different because that's for medium and
coarse<00:01:42.210> hair<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.560> might<00:01:43.770> have<00:01:43.979> thin<00:01:44.280> hair

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
coarse hair so you might have thin hair

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.330 
coarse hair so you might have thin hair
but<00:01:44.880> it's<00:01:45.030> just<00:01:45.270> coarser<00:01:45.960> each<00:01:46.619> strand<00:01:47.100> is<00:01:47.310> a

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
but it's just coarser each strand is a

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.889 
but it's just coarser each strand is a
little<00:01:47.640> bit<00:01:47.759> coarser<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:48.329> then<00:01:48.479> you'd<00:01:48.630> want<00:01:48.840> to

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
little bit coarser so then you'd want to

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.260 
little bit coarser so then you'd want to
use<00:01:49.049> level<00:01:49.409> five<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:50.700> would<00:01:50.820> be<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.090> level

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
use level five that would be the level

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.630 
use level five that would be the level
for<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.840> again<00:01:52.350> level<00:01:52.619> five<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:52.890> six<00:01:53.310> are<00:01:53.460> for

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
for you again level five and six are for

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.740 
for you again level five and six are for
not<00:01:53.909> treated<00:01:54.450> hair<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:56.060> level<00:01:57.060> six<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.479> if<00:01:57.630> you

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
not treated hair and level six is if you

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.780 
not treated hair and level six is if you
have<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:57.930> little<00:01:58.320> more<00:01:58.500> hair<00:01:58.770> loss<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.280> your

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
have a little more hair loss and your

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:00.310 
have a little more hair loss and your
hair<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.030> on

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
hair is on

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.590 
hair is on
treated<00:02:00.710> then<00:02:01.250> going<00:02:01.580> to<00:02:01.670> level<00:02:01.970> seven<00:02:02.390> and

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
treated then going to level seven and

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.960 
treated then going to level seven and
eight<00:02:02.810> those<00:02:03.380> are<00:02:03.560> for<00:02:03.740> chemically<00:02:04.340> treated

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
eight those are for chemically treated

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.419 
eight those are for chemically treated
again<00:02:05.479> and<00:02:06.159> level<00:02:07.159> seven<00:02:07.610> is<00:02:07.840> or<00:02:08.840> you<00:02:09.289> know
