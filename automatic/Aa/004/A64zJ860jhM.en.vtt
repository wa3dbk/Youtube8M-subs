main features first so this called
building<00:00:40.860> two<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:43.489> this<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.210> be<00:00:45.360> dom<00:00:45.570> area

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
building two and this is the be dom area

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.299 
building two and this is the be dom area
we're<00:00:46.170> looking<00:00:46.379> at<00:00:46.500> hard<00:00:46.710> point<00:00:46.950> right<00:00:47.129> now

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
we're looking at hard point right now

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.520 
we're looking at hard point right now
i'll<00:00:47.940> show<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.360> couple<00:00:48.750> hardpoint<00:00:49.320> cap

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
i'll show you a couple hardpoint cap

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.189 
i'll show you a couple hardpoint cap
spots<00:00:49.860> but<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:51.030> one<00:00:51.210> also<00:00:51.449> works<00:00:51.809> for<00:00:51.930> be

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
spots but this one also works for be

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.959 
spots but this one also works for be
dumb<00:00:52.410> as<00:00:52.739> well<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.539> if<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.690> get<00:00:54.899> up<00:00:55.050> on<00:00:55.260> this

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
dumb as well and if you get up on this

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.340 
dumb as well and if you get up on this
plane<00:00:56.969> right<00:00:57.329> here<00:00:57.539> i<00:00:57.570> think<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.050> plane

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
plane right here i think this is a plane

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.040 
plane right here i think this is a plane
crash<00:00:58.680> plane<00:00:59.030> and<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.210> look<00:01:00.420> right<00:01:00.719> at<00:01:00.899> this

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
crash plane and you look right at this

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.349 
crash plane and you look right at this
little<00:01:01.230> green<00:01:01.530> panel<00:01:02.370> right<00:01:02.520> here<00:01:02.760> it'll<00:01:03.059> let

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
little green panel right here it'll let

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.350 
little green panel right here it'll let
you<00:01:03.390> up<00:01:03.809> prone<00:01:04.500> out<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.760> could<00:01:05.970> cap<00:01:06.150> the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
you up prone out and you could cap the

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.240 
you up prone out and you could cap the
flag<00:01:06.390> right<00:01:06.840> here<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.320> cap<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.860> hardpoint

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
flag right here and cap the hardpoint

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.980 
flag right here and cap the hardpoint
and<00:01:08.580> i'm<00:01:09.060> going<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.210> cut<00:01:09.510> in<00:01:09.659> right<00:01:09.689> now<00:01:09.960> with

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.139 
a glimpse of you as your dolphin diving
but<00:01:59.040> most<00:01:59.280> people<00:01:59.549> don't<00:01:59.579> know<00:01:59.759> about<00:01:59.820> this

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
but most people don't know about this

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.270 
but most people don't know about this
little<00:02:00.329> path<00:02:00.570> yet<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.140> take<00:02:01.799> advantage<00:02:01.829> of

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
little path yet so take advantage of

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.330 
little path yet so take advantage of
that<00:02:02.340> moving<00:02:03.060> on<00:02:03.390> right<00:02:03.630> here<00:02:03.869> this<00:02:04.170> this<00:02:04.950> area

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
that moving on right here this this area

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.800 
that moving on right here this this area
is<00:02:05.549> called<00:02:05.880> ramps<00:02:06.689> like<00:02:06.840> i<00:02:06.960> said<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.759> as<00:02:08.810> i

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
is called ramps like i said and as i

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.420 
is called ramps like i said and as i
move<00:02:10.020> closer<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.590> this<00:02:10.709> hard<00:02:10.979> point<00:02:11.220> i<00:02:11.250> want<00:02:11.400> to

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
move closer to this hard point i want to

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.800 
move closer to this hard point i want to
show<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.730> couple<00:02:11.940> cap<00:02:12.360> spots<00:02:12.720> here

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
show you a couple cap spots here

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.150 
show you a couple cap spots here
you<00:02:13.930> can<00:02:14.080> cap<00:02:14.349> it<00:02:14.400> from<00:02:15.400> up<00:02:15.640> here<00:02:16.180> and<00:02:17.040> you<00:02:18.040> can

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
you can cap it from up here and you can

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.530 
you can cap it from up here and you can
look<00:02:18.370> through<00:02:18.400> this<00:02:18.700> little<00:02:18.910> crack<00:02:19.300> right

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
look through this little crack right

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.390 
look through this little crack right
here<00:02:19.599> as<00:02:19.989> long<00:02:20.200> as<00:02:20.380> your<00:02:20.470> team<00:02:20.680> holds<00:02:21.010> ramps

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
here as long as your team holds ramps

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.699 
here as long as your team holds ramps
this<00:02:21.610> is<00:02:21.730> a<00:02:21.760> nice<00:02:22.000> little<00:02:22.270> cap<00:02:23.230> spot<00:02:23.530> because

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
this is a nice little cap spot because

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.140 
this is a nice little cap spot because
you're<00:02:23.890> actually<00:02:24.069> getting<00:02:24.340> a<00:02:24.550> cut<00:02:24.760> off<00:02:24.940> as

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
you're actually getting a cut off as

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.510 
you're actually getting a cut off as
well<00:02:25.390> and<00:02:25.690> you<00:02:26.290> can<00:02:26.410> also<00:02:26.590> cap<00:02:27.010> it<00:02:27.190> from<00:02:27.370> this

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
well and you can also cap it from this

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.600 
well and you can also cap it from this
other<00:02:27.840> this<00:02:28.840> other<00:02:29.140> little<00:02:29.800> rail<00:02:30.069> right<00:02:30.310> here

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
other this other little rail right here

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.460 
other this other little rail right here
and<00:02:30.760> you<00:02:31.239> can<00:02:31.330> head<00:02:31.540> glitch<00:02:31.720> towards<00:02:32.019> ramps<00:02:32.349> if

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
and you can head glitch towards ramps if

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.059 
and you can head glitch towards ramps if
your<00:02:32.650> team<00:02:32.860> holds<00:02:33.310> crane<00:02:34.000> so<00:02:34.750> that<00:02:34.780> is<00:02:35.380> this<00:02:35.920> is

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
your team holds crane so that is this is

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.089 
your team holds crane so that is this is
the<00:02:36.190> sedum<00:02:36.550> area<00:02:36.819> obviously<00:02:37.030> and<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.980> can

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
the sedum area obviously and you can

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.949 
the sedum area obviously and you can
also<00:02:39.280> cap<00:02:39.640> behind<00:02:40.000> this<00:02:40.239> little<00:02:40.540> turbine

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
also cap behind this little turbine

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.110 
also cap behind this little turbine
engine<00:02:41.349> so<00:02:41.620> those<00:02:42.220> are<00:02:42.370> all<00:02:42.400> I<00:02:42.550> think<00:02:42.910> three

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
engine so those are all I think three

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.910 
engine so those are all I think three
good<00:02:43.269> cap<00:02:43.480> spots<00:02:43.780> for<00:02:43.989> this<00:02:44.080> this<00:02:44.530> last<00:02:44.709> hard

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
good cap spots for this this last hard

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.110 
good cap spots for this this last hard
point<00:02:45.190> I<00:02:45.400> want<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:45.850> point<00:02:46.060> out<00:02:46.209> this<00:02:46.480> I<00:02:46.780> call<00:02:47.080> a

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
point I want to point out this I call a

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.330 
point I want to point out this I call a
halt<00:02:49.120> or<00:02:49.480> long<00:02:49.720> haul<00:02:50.080> and<00:02:50.380> this<00:02:50.950> is<00:02:51.100> locker

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
halt or long haul and this is locker

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.759 
halt or long haul and this is locker
locker<00:02:51.760> stairs<00:02:52.209> right<00:02:52.540> there<00:02:52.569> but<00:02:53.380> I<00:02:53.410> want<00:02:53.739> to

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
locker stairs right there but I want to

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.229 
locker stairs right there but I want to
point<00:02:53.920> out<00:02:54.040> most<00:02:54.310> people<00:02:54.549> don't<00:02:54.700> realize<00:02:54.760> you

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
point out most people don't realize you

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.780 
point out most people don't realize you
can<00:02:55.390> go<00:02:55.569> outside<00:02:55.840> and<00:02:56.590> all<00:02:56.950> in<00:02:57.250> this<00:02:57.430> entire

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
can go outside and all in this entire

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.210 
can go outside and all in this entire
area<00:02:58.150> I'll<00:02:58.810> probably<00:02:59.080> die<00:02:59.380> right<00:02:59.650> here<00:02:59.680> but

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
area I'll probably die right here but

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.210 
area I'll probably die right here but
and<00:03:00.430> you<00:03:00.580> can<00:03:00.989> you<00:03:01.989> know<00:03:02.080> jump<00:03:02.349> back<00:03:02.530> in<00:03:02.799> jump

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
and you can you know jump back in jump

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.370 
and you can you know jump back in jump
back<00:03:03.370> out<00:03:03.610> and<00:03:03.880> you<00:03:04.420> can<00:03:04.450> actually<00:03:04.720> go<00:03:04.959> all<00:03:05.200> the

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
back out and you can actually go all the

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.220 
back out and you can actually go all the
way<00:03:05.410> over<00:03:05.739> to<00:03:05.769> the<00:03:05.950> area<00:03:06.310> i<00:03:06.370> call<00:03:06.610> stealth<00:03:07.230> and

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
way over to the area i call stealth and

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.670 
way over to the area i call stealth and
you<00:03:09.160> can<00:03:09.310> also<00:03:09.430> jump<00:03:09.849> off<00:03:10.060> like<00:03:10.330> that<00:03:10.510> but<00:03:11.170> yeah

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
you can also jump off like that but yeah

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.589 
you can also jump off like that but yeah
so<00:03:11.920> it<00:03:12.099> goes<00:03:12.310> all<00:03:12.519> the<00:03:12.549> way<00:03:12.760> over<00:03:13.090> to<00:03:13.120> this<00:03:13.390> area

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
so it goes all the way over to this area

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.670 
so it goes all the way over to this area
over<00:03:13.959> here<00:03:14.880> this<00:03:15.880> is<00:03:16.030> fire<00:03:16.269> truck<00:03:16.720> I<00:03:17.080> call<00:03:17.470> this

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
over here this is fire truck I call this

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.380 
over here this is fire truck I call this
right<00:03:17.950> here<00:03:18.130> twins<00:03:18.519> because<00:03:18.940> there's<00:03:19.209> two

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
right here twins because there's two

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.410 
right here twins because there's two
nice<00:03:19.660> jets<00:03:20.380> that<00:03:20.560> looks<00:03:20.769> very<00:03:20.859> similar<00:03:21.420> yeah

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
nice jets that looks very similar yeah

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.720 
nice jets that looks very similar yeah
very<00:03:22.600> clever<00:03:22.870> right<00:03:23.109> and<00:03:23.320> this<00:03:24.160> size<00:03:24.370> i<00:03:24.549> said

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
very clever right and this size i said

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.670 
very clever right and this size i said
is<00:03:24.850> stealth<00:03:26.760> and<00:03:27.840> if<00:03:28.840> i<00:03:28.959> hadn't<00:03:29.230> fallen<00:03:29.410> off

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
is stealth and if i hadn't fallen off

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.170 
is stealth and if i hadn't fallen off
you<00:03:29.890> can<00:03:30.010> what<00:03:30.190> you<00:03:30.489> can<00:03:30.609> jump<00:03:30.850> all<00:03:31.030> the<00:03:31.060> way

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
you can what you can jump all the way

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.970 
you can what you can jump all the way
along<00:03:31.359> here<00:03:31.510> there's<00:03:32.260> windows<00:03:32.590> you<00:03:32.739> can<00:03:32.799> get

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
along here there's windows you can get

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.620 
along here there's windows you can get
back<00:03:33.100> inside<00:03:33.310> at<00:03:33.670> any<00:03:33.790> point<00:03:34.030> most<00:03:34.269> people<00:03:34.600> i

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
back inside at any point most people i

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.090 
back inside at any point most people i
don't<00:03:34.720> think<00:03:34.959> know<00:03:35.079> about<00:03:35.290> that<00:03:35.440> route<00:03:35.950> right

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
don't think know about that route right

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.729 
don't think know about that route right
there<00:03:36.340> it's<00:03:36.489> pretty<00:03:36.670> useful<00:03:37.200> this<00:03:38.200> is<00:03:38.350> control

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
there it's pretty useful this is control

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.759 
there it's pretty useful this is control
or<00:03:39.220> control<00:03:39.579> tower<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:40.900> from<00:03:41.109> this<00:03:41.290> stairwell

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
or control tower and from this stairwell

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.580 
or control tower and from this stairwell
here<00:03:42.280> you<00:03:42.910> can<00:03:43.209> actually<00:03:43.630> jump<00:03:44.019> up<00:03:44.200> this<00:03:44.380> way

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
here you can actually jump up this way

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.400 
here you can actually jump up this way
which<00:03:44.799> is<00:03:44.950> useful<00:03:45.160> because<00:03:46.000> people<00:03:46.600> snipers

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
which is useful because people snipers

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.930 
which is useful because people snipers
will<00:03:47.560> be<00:03:47.650> sitting<00:03:47.859> over<00:03:48.069> there<00:03:48.100> waiting<00:03:48.430> for

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
will be sitting over there waiting for

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.809 
will be sitting over there waiting for
this<00:03:49.180> guy<00:03:49.450> to<00:03:49.480> come<00:03:49.750> up<00:03:49.870> these<00:03:49.989> stairs<00:03:50.319> and

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
this guy to come up these stairs and

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.640 
this guy to come up these stairs and
obviously<00:03:51.819> you<00:03:51.940> can<00:03:52.420> do<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:52.900> unexpected<00:03:53.019> pop

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
obviously you can do the unexpected pop

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.440 
obviously you can do the unexpected pop
out<00:03:53.859> here<00:03:54.190> and<00:03:55.380> hopefully<00:03:56.380> not<00:03:56.829> get<00:03:57.010> killed

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450
