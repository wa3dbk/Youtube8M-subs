00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.730 
hey what's up this is singing cuddle and
I<00:00:06.089> have<00:00:06.180> filled<00:00:06.420> with<00:00:06.600> me<00:00:06.779> and<00:00:07.080> we're<00:00:07.560> going<00:00:07.680> to

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
I have filled with me and we're going to

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.400 
I have filled with me and we're going to
work<00:00:07.950> on<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.490> push<00:00:08.700> hands<00:00:08.940> strategy<00:00:09.480> of<00:00:09.660> using

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
work on the push hands strategy of using

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.589 
work on the push hands strategy of using
the<00:00:10.500> elbows<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:11.250> affect<00:00:11.610> posture<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.420> balance

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
the elbows to affect posture and balance

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.839 
the elbows to affect posture and balance
now<00:00:13.440> first<00:00:13.740> to<00:00:13.860> illustrate<00:00:14.309> this<00:00:14.490> we're<00:00:14.730> going

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
now first to illustrate this we're going

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.060 
now first to illustrate this we're going
to<00:00:14.910> do<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.059> simple<00:00:15.360> joint<00:00:15.900> lock<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.800> show<00:00:17.010> you

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
to do a simple joint lock to show you

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.800 
to do a simple joint lock to show you
how<00:00:17.430> that<00:00:17.670> will<00:00:17.789> initially<00:00:18.420> affect<00:00:18.690> the

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
how that will initially affect the

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.510 
how that will initially affect the
balance<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.350> then<00:00:19.830> how<00:00:19.949> we<00:00:20.010> can<00:00:20.220> apply<00:00:20.460> this

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
balance and then how we can apply this

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.340 
balance and then how we can apply this
to<00:00:20.760> push<00:00:20.939> hands<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.869> first<00:00:22.080> thing<00:00:22.260> I'm

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
to push hands so the first thing I'm

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.720 
to push hands so the first thing I'm
going<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.500> do<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:22.949> I'm<00:00:23.160> going<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.310> take<00:00:23.460> Phil's

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
going to do is I'm going to take Phil's

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.390 
going to do is I'm going to take Phil's
hand<00:00:24.029> placing<00:00:24.449> both<00:00:25.019> my<00:00:25.289> thumb's<00:00:25.560> below<00:00:26.160> the

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
hand placing both my thumb's below the

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.429 
hand placing both my thumb's below the
middle<00:00:26.580> finger<00:00:26.789> knuckle<00:00:27.090> if<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:27.840> touch<00:00:28.170> the

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
middle finger knuckle if I touch the

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.380 
middle finger knuckle if I touch the
fingertips<00:00:28.980> they'll<00:00:29.519> Bend<00:00:29.849> on<00:00:30.029> their<00:00:30.179> own

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
fingertips they'll Bend on their own

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.179 
fingertips they'll Bend on their own
this<00:00:30.810> can<00:00:31.019> create<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.410> joint<00:00:31.679> lock<00:00:31.830> but<00:00:32.099> it

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
this can create a joint lock but it

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.370 
this can create a joint lock but it
doesn't<00:00:32.460> give<00:00:32.820> as<00:00:32.969> much<00:00:33.120> leverage<00:00:33.480> if<00:00:34.079> we're

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
doesn't give as much leverage if we're

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.560 
doesn't give as much leverage if we're
trying<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.649> get<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.890> wrist<00:00:35.100> from<00:00:35.520> here<00:00:35.790> I'm

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
trying to get the wrist from here I'm

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.430 
trying to get the wrist from here I'm
going<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.719> think<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:36.989> touching<00:00:37.200> his

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
going to think of touching his

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.709 
going to think of touching his
fingertips<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.250> his<00:00:38.370> forearm<00:00:38.879> not<00:00:39.329> by<00:00:39.510> just

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
fingertips to his forearm not by just

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.990 
fingertips to his forearm not by just
pressing<00:00:39.930> down<00:00:40.379> but<00:00:41.010> almost<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.460> roll<00:00:41.730> his

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
pressing down but almost to roll his

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.440 
pressing down but almost to roll his
forearm<00:00:42.510> up<00:00:42.920> towards<00:00:43.920> me<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:45.000> once<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.300> can

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
forearm up towards me so once I can

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.819 
forearm up towards me so once I can
apply<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:45.899> here<00:00:46.200> I'm<00:00:46.530> going<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.739> start

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
apply this here I'm going to start

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.920 
apply this here I'm going to start
affecting<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.489> elbow<00:00:47.850> now<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.660> way<00:00:48.780> what

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
affecting the elbow now the way what

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.420 
affecting the elbow now the way what
we're<00:00:49.020> gonna<00:00:49.140> do<00:00:49.320> this<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.649> just<00:00:49.829> turning<00:00:50.039> just

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
we're gonna do this is just turning just

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.069 
we're gonna do this is just turning just
like<00:00:50.520> if<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.730> had<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.879> steering<00:00:51.270> wheel<00:00:51.420> turn<00:00:51.870> to

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
like if you had a steering wheel turn to

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.799 
like if you had a steering wheel turn to
the<00:00:52.170> left<00:00:52.379> right<00:00:52.949> what<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.180> going<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.480> do

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
the left right what this is going to do

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.130

his<00:01:02.879> posture<00:01:03.420> shift<00:01:03.750> what<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.890> doing

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
his posture shift what this is doing

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.609 
his posture shift what this is doing
again<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.580> just<00:01:06.360> turning<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:06.840> elbow<00:01:07.290> that's

of his body's very off-balance from here
and<00:01:12.360> now<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.479> can<00:01:12.720> control<00:01:13.080> him<00:01:13.310> how<00:01:14.310> does<00:01:14.549> this

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
and now I can control him how does this

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.340 
and now I can control him how does this
apply<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.000> push<00:01:15.270> hands<00:01:15.479> we're<00:01:16.080> not<00:01:16.170> going<00:01:16.290> to

when you're doing push hands instead
we're<00:01:21.570> going<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.930> try<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.170> get<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.439> elbow<00:01:22.650> to

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
we're going to try to get the elbow to

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.399 
we're going to try to get the elbow to
do<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.220> same<00:01:23.460> action<00:01:24.060> right<00:01:24.840> here<00:01:24.869> from<00:01:25.320> the

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
do the same action right here from the

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
joint block you see the elbow tuck in

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.670 
joint block you see the elbow tuck in
towards<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.420> inside<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:27.990> body<00:01:28.170> you
