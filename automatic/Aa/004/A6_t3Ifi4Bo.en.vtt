I first are playing Minecraft this was
the<00:00:30.150> smallest<00:00:30.630> mind<00:00:31.050> era<00:00:32.270> it's<00:00:33.270> called<00:00:33.510> a

the smallest mind era it's called a

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.630 
the smallest mind era it's called a
clock<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.719> knew<00:00:37.050> about<00:00:37.219> this<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.430> what<00:00:38.610> I

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
clock that I knew about this is what I

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.760 
clock that I knew about this is what I
used<00:00:39.210> for<00:00:40.079> everything<00:00:42.170> not<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.320> best<00:00:43.410> design

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
used for everything not the best design

here's a one that I've seen just the
other<00:00:59.660> day<00:01:00.290> you<00:01:01.250> make<00:01:01.430> two<00:01:01.640> blocks<00:01:01.879> like<00:01:02.120> that

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
other day you make two blocks like that

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.010 
other day you make two blocks like that
staggered<00:01:02.960> put<00:01:03.860> yourself<00:01:04.280> a<00:01:04.400> torch<00:01:05.390> like<00:01:05.659> some

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
staggered put yourself a torch like some

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.719 
staggered put yourself a torch like some
push<00:01:06.890> it<00:01:07.010> out<00:01:07.100> a<00:01:07.130> little<00:01:07.250> bit<00:01:07.369> of<00:01:07.490> redstone

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
push it out a little bit of redstone

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.230 
push it out a little bit of redstone
dust<00:01:08.060> like<00:01:08.420> so<00:01:08.770> put<00:01:09.770> a<00:01:09.800> repeater<00:01:10.520> facing<00:01:11.060> in

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
dust like so put a repeater facing in

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.899 
dust like so put a repeater facing in
