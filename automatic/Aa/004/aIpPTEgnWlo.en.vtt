00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.240
 good 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:12.130
 hello gorgeous welcome very well to me 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:15.370
 channel and today I bring you a trick to 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.020
 look here a mini collection of 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.210
 glazes that I have and I bring you a 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.760
 trick for the small ones look how I have 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.279
 elephants the typical enamels that are 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.539
 already dry that they no longer have a solution 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.670
 You say what I do with them, my God 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.550
 let's throw it away no no what 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.950
 you have to see how normal the typical 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.870
 acetone the glazes because today 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.910
 I bring the trick of how to put these 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.370
 glazes that are already removed if they are 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.950
 as a chip the eyes so well as 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.410
 put them a bit more explicit as 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.690
 when we buy it, there are people who 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.030
 they say that we acetone him to see the 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.640
 acetone actually makes the enamel worse or 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.440
 that I have informed then the acetone 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.480
 it is but when it is very little very 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.760
 little bit of polish and throw 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.239
 only one or two droplets but 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:04.480
 we are going to do the following what 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.460
 ideal is to buy enamel solvent 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.200
 that they sell it already done and practically 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.420
 is cast and the enamel becomes as new 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.570
 but this video I do for those who 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.810
 house do not have solvent 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.180
 malte nor acetone or acetone but not 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.150
 dare to throw the seton to enamel 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.520
 as simple as you can see the smart 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.329
 it is dry see 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.679
 not drop a drop we will need 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:30.679
 Extra virgin olive oil 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.340
 sticks 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.340
 or a cotton 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.500
 and how this drips 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:55.380
 that droplet 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.380
 we are going to do to make it fall inside 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.979
 a 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:06.720
 ok the bribery crimes over here 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.720
 let's close 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.060
 and we are going to remove that we continue to see 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.710
 liquid that we still see taffy 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.140
 we return to take a couple of drops of 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.140
 oil I will remove super well 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.040
 as you see I also have here 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.380
 acetone normal nail polish remover 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.360
 life but I'm not going to throw it away because it's 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.430
 actually what it does that afterwards 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.740
 Remove the natural color to the enamel paint 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.330
 less late in drying more and spoiling it 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.920
 also if we throw a lot as he has 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.240
 said to people who are going to do tonal 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.290
 more combing a drop of oil 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.000
 and look 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.469
 good enamel I do not know if you can 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.609
 see here is that there is enough light what 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:47.609
 I put here in front so you can see 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.560
 the enamel 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.680
 It's perfect, you see 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.620
 a little bit 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:13.220
 it's clear then you can not appreciate 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.220
 but the smart is perfect 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.650
 if you see that for whatever the enamel is not 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.970
 it's dry you have to throw it away because that 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.070
 means that there is something prize does not have 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.080
 remedy that is too hard 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.540
 too much stone that's why it's still 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.310
 a solution then good this is the 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.140
