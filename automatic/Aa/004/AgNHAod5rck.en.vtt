skills you know the distal most aspect

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.560 
skills you know the distal most aspect
is<00:00:37.200> usually<00:00:37.620> planter<00:00:38.100> but<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.969> problem<00:00:39.180> there

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
is usually planter but the problem there

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.750 
is usually planter but the problem there
with<00:00:39.660> light<00:00:39.960> touch<00:00:40.350> vs.<00:00:40.980> pin<00:00:41.219> prick<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.579> that

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
with light touch vs. pin prick is that

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.299 
with light touch vs. pin prick is that
people<00:00:42.270> often<00:00:42.930> up<00:00:43.170> calluses<00:00:43.620> on<00:00:43.980> their<00:00:44.129> lower

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.220 
people often up calluses on their lower
extremities<00:00:44.340> on<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.059> plantar<00:00:45.390> aspect<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:46.020> so

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
extremities on the plantar aspect and so

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.279 
extremities on the plantar aspect and so
you<00:00:46.890> might<00:00:47.149> inappropriately<00:00:48.149> get<00:00:48.539> an

you might inappropriately get an

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.470 
you might inappropriately get an
abnormal<00:00:50.250> response<00:00:50.370> just<00:00:50.940> because<00:00:51.300> they're<00:00:51.449> a

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
abnormal response just because they're a

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.979 
abnormal response just because they're a
runner<00:00:51.809> for<00:00:52.110> example<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:53.719> what<00:00:54.719> if<00:00:54.840> you're

the distal most aspect of the plate if

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.640 
the distal most aspect of the plate if
you<00:00:58.620> checked<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.039> you're<00:00:59.219> silly

freedom to George school not by telling

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.620 
freedom to George school not by telling
you<00:04:10.200> exactly<00:04:11.480> so<00:04:12.480> nothing<00:04:12.959> to<00:04:13.050> worry<00:04:13.200> about

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
so once you're like let's say I asked

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.540 
so once you're like let's say I asked
you<00:04:26.370> to<00:04:26.460> do<00:04:26.910> your<00:04:27.360> tender<00:04:27.630> glances<00:04:27.810> and<00:04:28.490> by<00:04:29.490> the

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
you to do your tender glances and by the

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.130 
you to do your tender glances and by the
way<00:04:29.760> the<00:04:30.180> door<00:04:30.419> will<00:04:30.570> tell<00:04:30.780> you<00:04:30.840> everything

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
way the door will tell you everything

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.960 
way the door will tell you everything
you<00:04:31.290> need<00:04:31.500> to<00:04:31.530> do<00:04:31.770> so<00:04:32.280> it<00:04:32.400> would<00:04:32.550> never<00:04:32.730> tell

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
you need to do so it would never tell

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.670 
you need to do so it would never tell
you<00:04:33.000> to<00:04:33.090> just<00:04:33.330> two<00:04:33.510> reflexes<00:04:34.110> and<00:04:34.260> suddenly

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
you to just two reflexes and suddenly

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.100 
you to just two reflexes and suddenly
found<00:04:34.919> the<00:04:35.700> standardized<00:04:36.240> patient<00:04:36.660> gives<00:04:36.900> you

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
found the standardized patient gives you

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.830 
found the standardized patient gives you
a<00:04:37.350> formula<00:04:37.980> no<00:04:38.880> the<00:04:39.120> door<00:04:39.300> would<00:04:39.480> tell<00:04:39.690> you

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
a formula no the door would tell you

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.930 
a formula no the door would tell you
exactly<00:04:40.380> what<00:04:40.650> to<00:04:40.680> do<00:04:40.950> go<00:04:41.340> and<00:04:41.520> do<00:04:41.700> this<00:04:41.730> and

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
exactly what to do go and do this and

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.960 
exactly what to do go and do this and
then<00:04:42.210> do<00:04:42.390> this<00:04:42.660> and<00:04:42.930> so<00:04:43.919> once<00:04:44.610> you're<00:04:44.820> finished

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
then do this and so once you're finished

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.330 
then do this and so once you're finished
during<00:04:45.330> the<00:04:45.390> reflexes<00:04:45.990> if<00:04:46.620> I<00:04:46.919> was<00:04:47.100> going<00:04:47.280> to

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
during the reflexes if I was going to

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.820 
during the reflexes if I was going to
ask<00:04:47.400> you<00:04:47.700> to<00:04:48.030> rate<00:04:48.360> them<00:04:48.480> then<00:04:48.930> the<00:04:49.380> patient<00:04:49.560> we

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
ask you to rate them then the patient we

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.740 
ask you to rate them then the patient we
give<00:04:50.040> you<00:04:50.160> a<00:04:50.190> piece<00:04:50.730> of<00:04:50.760> paper<00:04:51.060> and<00:04:51.150> say<00:04:51.390> we

get your name on each piece of paper if
you<00:05:03.380> yes<00:05:04.380> we<00:05:04.950> really<00:05:05.220> did<00:05:05.400> read<00:05:05.669> the<00:05:05.760> door<00:05:05.970> and

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
you yes we really did read the door and

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.940 
you yes we really did read the door and
you<00:05:06.479> give<00:05:06.660> it<00:05:06.780> right<00:05:06.900> back<00:05:06.960> to<00:05:07.140> the<00:05:07.350> patient<00:05:07.740> I

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
you give it right back to the patient I

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.500 
you give it right back to the patient I
mean<00:05:08.550> in<00:05:08.610> the<00:05:08.790> scenario<00:05:09.720> yes<00:05:10.560> I<00:05:11.360> guess<00:05:12.360> you

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
mean in the scenario yes I guess you

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.390 
mean in the scenario yes I guess you
couldn't<00:05:12.780> take<00:05:12.900> it<00:05:12.960> in<00:05:13.169> but<00:05:13.530> I<00:05:13.800> don't<00:05:14.250> think

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
couldn't take it in but I don't think

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.190 
couldn't take it in but I don't think
that<00:05:14.610> you<00:05:14.700> would<00:05:14.850> need<00:05:14.970> to<00:05:17.960> any<00:05:18.960> other

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
that you would need to any other

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.909 
that you would need to any other
questions<00:05:20.660> because<00:05:21.660> this<00:05:21.840> should<00:05:22.260> be<00:05:22.440> one<00:05:22.800> of

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
questions because this should be one of

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.580 
questions because this should be one of
the<00:05:23.010> easiest<00:05:23.550> ways<00:05:24.030> to<00:05:24.419> get<00:05:24.660> ten<00:05:24.930> percent<00:05:25.380> of

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
the easiest ways to get ten percent of

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.680 
the easiest ways to get ten percent of
duty<00:05:25.890> for<00:05:26.160> this<00:05:26.310> course<00:05:26.610> it<00:05:27.060> really<00:05:27.360> should

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
duty for this course it really should

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.170 
duty for this course it really should
you<00:05:28.229> can<00:05:28.410> understand<00:05:28.860> though<00:05:29.070> that<00:05:29.100> if<00:05:29.550> when

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
you can understand though that if when

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.790 
you can understand though that if when
we<00:05:30.210> never<00:05:30.479> did<00:05:30.750> this<00:05:30.900> type<00:05:31.200> of<00:05:31.229> test

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
we never did this type of test

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.680 
we never did this type of test
four<00:05:32.069> people<00:05:32.250> could<00:05:32.550> graduate<00:05:33.240> from<00:05:33.539> the

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
four people could graduate from the

four people could graduate from the
brain<00:05:33.870> and<00:05:33.990> behavior<00:05:34.050> course<00:05:34.560> and<00:05:34.740> really

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:34.949 
brain and behavior course and really

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:35.899 
brain and behavior course and really
never<00:05:35.129> know<00:05:35.280> how<00:05:35.400> to<00:05:35.490> do<00:05:35.610> a<00:05:35.669> simple

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:35.909 
never know how to do a simple

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:38.240 
never know how to do a simple
examination<00:05:36.330> and<00:05:36.930> so<00:05:37.500> my<00:05:37.650> goal<00:05:37.860> is<00:05:38.009> just<00:05:38.039> to

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
examination and so my goal is just to

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.100 
examination and so my goal is just to
make<00:05:38.460> sure<00:05:38.490> that<00:05:38.940> not<00:05:39.509> that<00:05:39.659> you<00:05:39.810> know<00:05:39.900> how<00:05:40.020> to

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
make sure that not that you know how to

the difference between the two versus of
one<00:05:59.069> versus<00:05:59.430> of<00:05:59.580> three<00:05:59.819> this<00:06:00.629> pony<00:06:01.169> rooms<00:06:01.530> are

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
one versus of three this pony rooms are

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.339 
one versus of three this pony rooms are
there<00:06:01.919> there<00:06:02.250> will<00:06:02.340> be<00:06:02.370> six<00:06:02.669> rooms<00:06:03.110> the<00:06:04.110> last

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:04.349 
there there will be six rooms the last

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:06.649 
there there will be six rooms the last
room<00:06:04.740> will<00:06:05.129> be<00:06:05.159> a<00:06:05.490> communal<00:06:06.240> room<00:06:06.419> like<00:06:06.629> this

00:06:06.649 --> 00:06:06.659 
room will be a communal room like this

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:08.899 
room will be a communal room like this
one<00:06:07.050> where<00:06:07.710> it<00:06:08.009> will<00:06:08.129> consist<00:06:08.430> as<00:06:08.610> its<00:06:08.789> own

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:08.909 
one where it will consist as its own

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:10.999 
one where it will consist as its own
station<00:06:09.389> so<00:06:09.930> there'll<00:06:10.050> be<00:06:10.080> five<00:06:10.409> doors

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:11.009 
station so there'll be five doors

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:13.580 
station so there'll be five doors
technically<00:06:11.610> and<00:06:11.879> then<00:06:12.000> one<00:06:12.210> last<00:06:12.389> door<00:06:12.810> the

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
technically and then one last door the

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.469 
technically and then one last door the
last<00:06:13.830> door<00:06:14.099> is<00:06:14.219> where<00:06:14.430> you<00:06:14.580> all<00:06:14.759> walk<00:06:15.000> into<00:06:15.330> one

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 
last door is where you all walk into one

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:28.260 
last door is where you all walk into one
room<00:06:15.509> and<00:06:15.990> you<00:06:16.889> do<00:06:17.069> something

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.610 

it's<00:06:29.270> not<00:06:29.480> that<00:06:29.660> I<00:06:29.690> figure<00:06:30.110> out<00:06:30.170> that<00:06:30.440> one's

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:30.620
