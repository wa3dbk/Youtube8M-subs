 friendly tournament before what is going to be 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:16.490
 the great date of this season where 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:17.990
 is plagued by global is the case 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.730
 also of field hockey both in 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.070
 men as in women is going to play 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.730
 from May 31 in the Netherlands in the 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.200
 beech 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.270
 the girls got on the plane and for 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.670
 course we were with sport of 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.130
 news before this happened and 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.360
 We speak with their captain with Luciana 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.579
 paula and marc that is living a 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.530
 special moment that is playing its 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.540
 last tournaments as I know it comes 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.570
 saying from the london games 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.120
 but I really to how it feels is to 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.180
 its projection I think if it's not the 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.450
 world we are practically living 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.969
 his last 10 15 games 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.040
 at most, and on the other 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.850
 side the sheet retegui that the sheet 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.079
 retegui are going to listen carefully to a 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.480
 What did Mariana Elvis do to you? 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.739
 what has to do with the rumor that there was 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.880
 that he would call again to 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:11.460
 Claudia Burkart I know there were talks 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.460
 but good listen to them first 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.200
 there are only 22 girls left 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.840
 possibilities to play the cup of 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.200
 world and good now go 18 so there 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.020
 90% of the girls that are going to go like this 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.160
 that we hope we can make a 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.990
 good tour to continue adding up 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.790
 workouts and find the pace of 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.160
 international hockey game as before 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.380
 possible to get the best way to 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.700
 the world cup we are training 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.619
 the girls who are training and 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.130
 and I think the World Cup team is going to 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.190
 get out of there 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.930
 although we had some expectation 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.890
 we think we are very close to the cup 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.130
 of the world 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.630
 and well you have to concentrate on the 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.850
 girls that are training that are 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.520
 trying very hard that the truth that 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.430
 They are giving us a lot and we are already 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.190
 two months of the Dutch debut and 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.229
 there is very little we have our tour 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.179
 which for me is very good beyond 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.039
 trip that is long but we are 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.440
 used is very good as 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.570
 training to know how 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.520
 we are and how are the other teams 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:20.450
 previous world that are the last 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.250
 tournaments with argentina then I think that 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.010
 I enjoy it in another way there is no other 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.370
 place trying to give it more importance 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.950
 every moment that I have to be with the 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.690
 girls with the group with the shirt and 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.980
 I will also really enjoy this 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.360
 tournament that is a great tournament because 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.739
 many teams play what they are going to 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.640
 be in high level and good world 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.170
 knowing that I have little left 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.709
 I enjoy it a little more I imagine it 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:49.060
 a great hockey party is a tournament 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:52.870
 it's going to be a mixed tournament so 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.060
 I was lucky to have one in 98 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.150
 it was the last mixed world and it was a 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.370
 amazing party people like I enjoy 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:05.019
 of the hockey tournament in general so 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.019
 It's going to be very nice to live it
