00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
well in the center defensive mid so we

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.289

buy minocin defensive mid for less than
what<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.600> card<00:01:15.810> would<00:01:15.990> actually<00:01:16.350> cost<00:01:16.590> of

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
what the card would actually cost of

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:17.990
