00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760 

why<00:00:00.329> are<00:00:00.510> we<00:00:00.659> seeing<00:00:00.870> more<00:00:01.230> of<00:00:01.260> these<00:00:01.469> threats

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
why are we seeing more of these threats

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.379 
why are we seeing more of these threats
is<00:00:01.920> it<00:00:02.010> because<00:00:02.250> more<00:00:02.460> people<00:00:02.490> like<00:00:02.970> you<00:00:03.030> are

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
is it because more people like you are

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.510 
is it because more people like you are
getting<00:00:03.480> better<00:00:03.810> at<00:00:04.290> tracking<00:00:04.680> them<00:00:04.980> down<00:00:05.009> or

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
getting better at tracking them down or

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.470 
getting better at tracking them down or
they're<00:00:05.730> just<00:00:05.970> more<00:00:06.089> of<00:00:06.210> these<00:00:06.330> things

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
they're just more of these things

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.870 
they're just more of these things
happening<00:00:06.960> out<00:00:07.080> there<00:00:07.429> well<00:00:08.429> I<00:00:08.460> think<00:00:08.639> it's<00:00:08.820> a

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
happening out there well I think it's a

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.160 
happening out there well I think it's a
combination<00:00:09.120> of<00:00:09.360> both<00:00:09.420> it's<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:09.840> pleasure<00:00:10.019> to

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
combination of both it's a pleasure to

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.980 
combination of both it's a pleasure to
be<00:00:10.230> here<00:00:10.500> I<00:00:11.250> think<00:00:11.730> in<00:00:11.940> this<00:00:12.269> particular<00:00:12.450> case

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
be here I think in this particular case

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.930 
be here I think in this particular case
the<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:14.009> vulnerability<00:00:14.639> was<00:00:15.139> was<00:00:16.139> widespread

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:16.940 
the the vulnerability was was widespread

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.960 
the the vulnerability was was widespread
roughly<00:00:17.940> 1<00:00:18.150> in<00:00:18.180> 4<00:00:18.539> users<00:00:18.840> visiting<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.590> web

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
roughly 1 in 4 users visiting the web

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.910

going to any website that hosts this
type<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.160> exploit<00:00:23.699> would<00:00:23.880> have<00:00:23.970> gotten

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
type of exploit would have gotten

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.450 
type of exploit would have gotten
compromised<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:25.050> we<00:00:25.590> don't<00:00:25.740> see<00:00:26.130> this<00:00:26.250> going

darian are you looking in particular for
flaws<00:00:49.620> in<00:00:49.980> XP<00:00:50.430> because<00:00:50.789> it's<00:00:50.969> not<00:00:51.149> being

at the effects of the victims involved

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.780 
at the effects of the victims involved
and<00:01:15.000> we're<00:01:15.450> able<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.810> then<00:01:16.020> further<00:01:16.979> develop

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
and we're able to then further develop

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.960 
and we're able to then further develop
defenses<00:01:19.340> protections<00:01:20.340> as<00:01:20.549> well<00:01:20.820> as

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
to necessarily go through and documents

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.620 
to necessarily go through and documents
all<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.340> different<00:01:26.580> vulnerabilities<00:01:26.640> these

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
all the different vulnerabilities these

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.109 
all the different vulnerabilities these
attackers<00:01:27.930> already<00:01:28.320> doing<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.680> for<00:01:28.920> us<00:01:29.119> so

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
attackers already doing that for us so

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.300 
attackers already doing that for us so
daring<00:01:30.600> walk<00:01:30.780> us<00:01:30.930> through<00:01:31.170> how<00:01:31.380> serious<00:01:32.159> this

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
daring walk us through how serious this

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.280 
daring walk us through how serious this
particular<00:01:32.820> vulnerability<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.079> what

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
particular vulnerability is and what

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.490 
particular vulnerability is and what
does<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.439> actually<00:01:34.680> mean<00:01:36.079> well<00:01:37.079> so

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
does it actually mean well so

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.319 
does it actually mean well so
fundamentally<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.790> know<00:01:38.909> zero-day

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
fundamentally you know zero-day

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.359 
fundamentally you know zero-day
vulnerabilities<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.200> zero-day<00:01:40.799> attacks<00:01:41.130> are

vulnerabilities and zero-day attacks are

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.819 
vulnerabilities and zero-day attacks are
roughly<00:01:41.670> two<00:01:41.880> different<00:01:42.180> things

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
roughly two different things

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:44.690 
roughly two different things
vulnerabilities<00:01:43.829> themselves<00:01:44.490> are<00:01:44.579> not

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
vulnerabilities themselves are not

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.850 
vulnerabilities themselves are not
necessarily<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.689> serious<00:01:46.200> unless<00:01:46.649> you're

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
necessarily that serious unless you're

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.929 
necessarily that serious unless you're
doing<00:01:46.950> with<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.250> remote<00:01:47.520> code<00:01:47.909> execution

doing with a remote code execution

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.569 
doing with a remote code execution
vulnerability<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:49.500> allows<00:01:49.799> an<00:01:49.979> attacker<00:01:50.100> to

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
vulnerability that allows an attacker to

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.690 
vulnerability that allows an attacker to
fundamentally<00:01:51.299> compromise<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:52.530> user<00:01:53.130> remotely

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
are the types that we see constantly

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.940 
are the types that we see constantly
used<00:01:57.719> by<00:01:57.960> these<00:01:58.020> different<00:01:58.530> threat<00:01:58.710> groups

and<00:01:59.189> those<00:01:59.610> are<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.790> ones<00:01:59.850> that<00:02:00.090> we<00:02:00.270> see<00:02:00.450> the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
and those are the ones that we see the

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.130 
and those are the ones that we see the
most<00:02:00.960> severe<00:02:01.729> fundamentally<00:02:02.729> we<00:02:03.659> see<00:02:03.899> this

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
most severe fundamentally we see this

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.590 
most severe fundamentally we see this
type<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.439> issue<00:02:06.140> getting<00:02:07.140> worse<00:02:07.409> over<00:02:07.829> time

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
type of issue getting worse over time

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.900 
type of issue getting worse over time
okay<00:02:09.440> so<00:02:09.500> if<00:02:09.770> I<00:02:09.860> have<00:02:10.010> internet<00:02:10.310> explorer<00:02:10.610> what

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
okay so if I have internet explorer what

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.560 
okay so if I have internet explorer what
should<00:02:11.090> I<00:02:11.180> do<00:02:11.920> well<00:02:12.920> fundamentally<00:02:13.580> right<00:02:14.390> now

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
should I do well fundamentally right now

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.820
