basically there's two ways you can start

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.410 
basically there's two ways you can start
by<00:01:28.890> either<00:01:29.130> pushing<00:01:29.400> out<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.729> camera<00:01:30.210> lens

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
by either pushing out the camera lens

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.480 
by either pushing out the camera lens
and<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:31.320> do<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.890> want<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.130> start<00:01:32.369> at<00:01:32.460> the

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
and to do that you want to start at the

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.160 
and to do that you want to start at the
top<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.450> just<00:01:33.570> give<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.840> little<00:01:33.960> bit<00:01:34.110> of

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
top and you just give it a little bit of

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.929 
top and you just give it a little bit of
a<00:01:34.259> push<00:01:34.470> as<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.979> can<00:01:35.159> see<00:01:35.369> I've<00:01:35.640> gone<00:01:35.790> ahead

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
a push as you can see I've gone ahead

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.990 
a push as you can see I've gone ahead
and<00:01:36.140> got<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.350> iPhone<00:01:37.829> pushed<00:01:38.549> out<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.790> little

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
and got the iPhone pushed out a little

and got the iPhone pushed out a little
bit<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.479> then<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:39.780> want<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.049> come<00:01:40.380> here<00:01:40.530> to

actually works a little bit better on
the<00:01:59.729> iPhone<00:02:00.090> 5<00:02:00.329> because<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.719> have<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:00.899> little

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
the iPhone 5 because you have a little

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.560 
the iPhone 5 because you have a little
bit<00:02:01.259> bigger<00:02:01.530> opening<00:02:02.100> but<00:02:02.880> that's<00:02:03.090> one<00:02:03.360> way

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
bit bigger opening but that's one way

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.749 
bit bigger opening but that's one way
you<00:02:03.630> can<00:02:03.899> do<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.680> second<00:02:05.100> way<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.219> I<00:02:05.430> find

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
you can do it the second way that I find

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.340
