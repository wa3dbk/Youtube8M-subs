00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.849
 or not 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.950
 and directly from Berlin sends us the 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:12.980
 people from sony in mexico this is the 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.910
 sony xperia z 3 and I know that you want 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.910
 see all they have 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.790
 and well this is going to be a box and very 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.770
 fast because really what we 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.360
 they sent the phone in the box 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.520
 nothing else is for you to see as in the 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.030
 box here is the team 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.970
 this is the z3 the successor of the first z 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.790
 one then the two z and now this one that is 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.950
 let's say the premium line or the more 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.630
 sophisticated of are and we will be by 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.580
 parts things we're going to take away your 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.610
 plastic to but here is the exact 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.380
 removes plastics for people to put 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.970
 nervous 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.610
 now it is already started from here 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:55.630
 no longer has a joke, it is not the same anymore 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:58.330
 It is not like before and I go better list 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.860
 it's in its first plastic and in the part 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.860
 It also has a plastic 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.900
 protector let's turn it on and well the 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.030
 aspects are the characteristics of this 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.880
 team is that of course it's lte's 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.230
 last generation uses a nano sim yo 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.170
 I thought it was the micro but it's not a 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.180
 nano synths presented a few 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.710
 days in Berlin is now available for 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.360
 course all over the world and also in 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:27.369
 mexico how much is 246 by 72 millimeters 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:29.860
 by 7.3 weighs 152 grams is not very 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.960
 livianito nor very heavy in matters of 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.300
 that holds the water can be put 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.250
 bathe with him or in the shower or 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.190
 sheltered you want has the 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.320
 ip68 certification if whoever does 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.360
 Of course the dust holds the water and 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.650
 you can put it up to half an hour a 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.920
 depth meter 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.750
 that's the ip68 specification there are other 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.150
 more sophisticated there are others with less 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.830
 resistance but good this if you endure 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.850
 the water and how it holds the water has 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.150
 all fractures 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.340
 with few doors closures 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.979
 they are precisely sealed and thus prevent 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.720
 you get the water but you have the detail 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.520
 than to charge it every night 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.590
 you have to open the door and closing 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.010
 with each other in this in this 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.560
 meaning the screen is 5.2 inches in 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.569
 here until here they are and still leaving he is 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.430
 a chunk down and up 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:22.060
 I do not want that in future models 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.220
 these edges will be understanding to do more 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.500
 smaller ones so that there 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:31.870
 more screen space within the 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:34.780
 computer 1920 x 1080 points with a 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.000
 density of 424 dots per inch 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.580
 quite high and good because it has the 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.540
 luminous tree technology display and ex 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.370
 reality engine all are features 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.110
 that you have are and that you inherit it from 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.390
 televisions and puts it on the screens 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.970
 of cell phones and good what else has 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.580
 you can put a microsd card 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.910
 up to 128 gigabytes to increase the 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.860
 RAM storage capacity is 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.060
 with 3 gigs quite suitable for 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.760
 load many programs 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.830
 there are two versions 16 and 32 gb of 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.580
 internal storage has good 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:12.270
 All radios wifi bluetooth 4.0 nfc 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.830
 has a microusb connector to be able 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.180
 energize and also of course to 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.040
 connect to computers is that you 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.230
 Interested in commenting on the computer 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.920
 battery 3100 milian pÃ©rez 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.290
 I believe that it hardly gives for so many 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.569
 points on screen and the size I think 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.760
 that 3100 if he goes there fighting 10 12 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.819
 hours of use you have to see the process is 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.640
 a qualcomm snapdragon is quad core a 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:40.239
 2.5 gigabytes comes with android by 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:43.269
 course 4.4 point 4 with these are and the 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.580
 series z I have a I have an issue that 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:48.519
 I feel that it slips away, I do not know, it's the 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:51.310
 material of course this one in particular 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:53.049
 and well, it comes to replace the z 2 and 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.560
 no doubt for all the people who 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:58.780
 he loves this firm will be a product 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.700
 very interesting there are three colors this 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.500
 which is white there is a black one and a color 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.079
 golden in case he wants to venture there 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.340
 those grounds of the golden smartphones 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:10.879
 camera or camera sensor 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:16.449
 20 points 7 megapixels that's going to 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:19.579
 let take pictures with 5248 for 3 thousand 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:21.769
 936 pixels ie very large photos 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:25.340
 to print in large format has 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:27.080
 autofocus has a led flash so that 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.440
 you can take pictures there if there is not much 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:33.080
 natural lighting the front camera 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.570
 2.2 megapixels this camera records 1080p 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:40.490
 30 frames per second and the camera 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:42.620
 Later record at 2,160 pe to 30 frames 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.510
 per second is aggravated by 4k in case 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.280
 you want there you already know how to make your 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.400
 recordings or your first steps with this 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.139
 matter here is the water not and then 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.880
 what we are going to do is let's put it 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.770
 to record a video to see if there is the 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.530
 video recording there you can see that from 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.910
 a few seconds without being so know and let's 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.320
 to not serve they are exterminated closed all 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.169
 the doors so there is no 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.750
 problem let's put it here in water 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:08.360
 he said well then let's put it down 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.830
 Everywhere there is and continues to record 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.270
 of course we are going to see right now 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.100
 record the water 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.290
 but the phone is still operating because 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.540
 is made to hold up to one meter 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:20.330
 of depth for 30 minutes 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.370
 Thomas bubble baths not very long 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.480
 but 30 minutes if he's going to pull and the 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.220
 truth is that these teams are 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.530
 designed I feel this protection 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.380
 against water is why you drop it is not not 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.390
 to use it under the tub or in other words 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.280
 down the water but hey there is already 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:37.720
 he's pretty good wet by all 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.720
 let's take it out 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:41.759
 Y 

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:46.759
 all the doors there is no problem 

00:05:53.689 --> 00:06:00.360
 the phone keeps recording without major 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:02.969
 problem and it's the sony xperia z 3 that 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:06.239
 as it is ip68 also holds up a bit 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:10.529
 blows so you can throw it away so you can say 

00:06:06.239 --> 00:06:11.999
 if it is not more or less with caution because 

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:15.240
 it is possible that you because despite speaking 

00:06:11.999 --> 00:06:19.919
 by phone and an airplane you see for 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:22.729
 then the phone goes down there is no need to 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:25.169
 invent new things not or a cocazo not 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:28.399
 and football ended but it does not matter 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:31.979
 grabs is gol 

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:33.990
 as was the lamb cap on children 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:37.560
 paper 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:39.690
 it is the sun and xperia z3 just 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:43.850
 unpackaging berlin and it is 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.850
 watching of course here in 10 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.750
 We are checking the quality of the image 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:51.240
 with our nieces the girls of 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:54.750
 brain and a characteristic that has 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:56.460
 phones that have two speakers and enters 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:59.370
 in the field of large telephones 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:03.949
 this is the microusb port here goes the 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:03.949
 microstra oltra card we open for your
