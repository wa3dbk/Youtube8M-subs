00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
ones not as much still in horizon

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.770 
ones not as much still in horizon
obviously<00:01:26.400> just<00:01:26.759> because<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.270> tuning<00:01:27.659> but

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
obviously just because of the tuning but

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.929 
obviously just because of the tuning but
I've<00:01:28.409> started<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.799> get<00:01:28.890> over<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.250> over<00:01:29.850> the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
fact that there's no tuning in this game

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.420 
fact that there's no tuning in this game
because<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.600> Forza<00:01:33.600> 5<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.259> I'm<00:01:34.470> just<00:01:34.829> waiting

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940

video not much faster than this
a<00:01:51.060> little<00:01:51.930> bit<00:01:52.020> disappointed<00:01:52.770> kinda<00:01:53.220> with<00:01:53.400> the

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
a little bit disappointed kinda with the

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.030 
a little bit disappointed kinda with the
top<00:01:53.850> speed<00:01:54.540> of<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:54.780> car<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:55.080> expected<00:01:55.830> a<00:01:55.890> bit

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
top speed of this car I expected a bit

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.500 
top speed of this car I expected a bit
faster<00:01:56.550> but<00:01:56.910> I<00:01:57.210> mean<00:01:59.090> it's<00:02:00.090> not<00:02:00.150> really<00:02:00.390> the

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
faster but I mean it's not really the

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.840 
faster but I mean it's not really the
fastest<00:02:00.990> car<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.350> world<00:02:01.410> so<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:02.280> guess<00:02:02.670> it's

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
fastest car in the world so I guess it's

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.750 
fastest car in the world so I guess it's
realistic<00:02:03.150> but<00:02:03.930> we<00:02:04.050> get<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.440> to<00:02:04.770> 32<00:02:05.490> miles

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
realistic but we get it to to 32 miles

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.250 
realistic but we get it to to 32 miles
per<00:02:05.910> hour<00:02:06.120> that's<00:02:06.360> pretty<00:02:06.780> good<00:02:06.960> and

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
per hour that's pretty good and

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.130 
per hour that's pretty good and
hopefully<00:02:08.010> you<00:02:08.220> guys<00:02:08.340> enjoyed<00:02:08.760> great<00:02:09.720> pact<00:02:09.960> to
