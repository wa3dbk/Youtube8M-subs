00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
points into it the code does go down by

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.819 
points into it the code does go down by
2<00:00:56.100> per<00:00:56.760> level<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.780> does<00:00:57.930> apply<00:00:58.170> slow<00:00:58.559> or

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
2 per level and it does apply slow or

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
putting points at the W does increase

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.340 
putting points at the W does increase
its<00:01:02.940> mana<00:01:03.149> cost<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.809> doesn't<00:01:04.049> even<00:01:04.110> go

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
its mana cost and it doesn't even go

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.020 
its mana cost and it doesn't even go
down<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.799> code<00:01:05.040> out<00:01:05.159> alright<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:05.790> let's<00:01:05.970> look

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
down and code out alright so let's look

mid lane so he can start shopping at
level<00:01:12.570> 1<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.990> getting<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.560> lot<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.770> pressure

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
level 1 and getting a lot of pressure

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.039 
level 1 and getting a lot of pressure
onto<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.460> enemy<00:01:14.729> laner<00:01:14.880> smart<00:01:15.689> people<00:01:15.930> will

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
onto the enemy laner smart people will

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.330 
onto the enemy laner smart people will
not<00:01:16.200> allow<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.619> do<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.159> try<00:01:17.310> and

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
not allow you to do that so the try and

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.100 
not allow you to do that so the try and
get<00:01:17.580> rid<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.790> at<00:01:17.939> level<00:01:18.240> 1<00:01:18.390> but<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.869> basically

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
get rid of at level 1 but you basically

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.749 
get rid of at level 1 but you basically
get<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.500> general<00:01:19.860> idea<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.220> how<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.400> do<00:01:20.610> it

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
get the general idea of how to do it

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.399 
get the general idea of how to do it

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
first I'll probably you'll be shoving

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.330 
first I'll probably you'll be shoving
them<00:01:59.110> into<00:01:59.259> towers<00:01:59.649> since<00:01:59.830> you<00:01:59.920> do<00:02:00.039> have<00:02:00.220> to

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
them into towers since you do have to

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.859 
them into towers since you do have to
your<00:02:00.459> turrets<00:02:00.729> to<00:02:00.819> zone<00:02:01.030> them<00:02:01.209> and<00:02:01.390> to<00:02:01.659> shove

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
your turrets to zone them and to shove

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.870 
your turrets to zone them and to shove
and<00:02:02.140> second<00:02:02.740> off<00:02:02.860> if<00:02:03.009> they<00:02:03.159> do<00:02:03.220> ever<00:02:03.520> want<00:02:03.789> to

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.520 
and second off if they do ever want to
trade<00:02:04.119> or<00:02:04.630> if<00:02:04.750> they<00:02:04.810> got<00:02:04.929> to<00:02:05.049> be<00:02:05.140> melee<00:02:05.409> to

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
trade or if they got to be melee to

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.050 
trade or if they got to be melee to
trade<00:02:05.770> so<00:02:05.979> you<00:02:06.069> can<00:02:06.189> use<00:02:06.369> your<00:02:06.490> ultimate<00:02:06.759> and

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
also cause a lot of zoning potential as

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.190 
also cause a lot of zoning potential as
those<00:03:42.310> have<00:03:42.460> 2,500<00:03:43.300> point<00:03:43.510> or<00:03:43.600> so<00:03:43.750> at<00:03:43.990> like

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
those have 2,500 point or so at like

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.110 
those have 2,500 point or so at like
level<00:03:44.350> 16<00:03:44.860> and<00:03:45.040> it's<00:03:45.460> basically<00:03:45.790> just<00:03:45.940> like

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
level 16 and it's basically just like

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.180 
level 16 and it's basically just like
another<00:03:46.480> attack<00:03:46.810> damage<00:03:47.020> carry<00:03:47.350> so<00:03:47.950> in<00:03:48.100> the
