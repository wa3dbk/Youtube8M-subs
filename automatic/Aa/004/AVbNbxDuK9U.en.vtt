00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:02.050
 Dnepropetrovsk land was sent to 

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:03.639
 analysis after one of the public 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:05.879
 environmental organizations said 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.250
 that the soil in the city became lead 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.550
 hazardous metal concentrations 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.230
 exceeds the norm at least 20 times 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.139
 alarmed 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:15.769
 This many blame around the local 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:17.939
 enterprises and although this station 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:20.099
 denies information 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:22.210
 already started preparing for a scale 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.449
 environmental monitoring more 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.909
 Natalia Gryshchenko will tell 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:31.339
 in the poll a major heard that the hall 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:32.540
 air and there 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.910
 there girls are born unhealthy 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.810
 with her two month old daughter natalya 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.430
 you have to walk half a kilometer from 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.920
 industrial zones in this plant 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.460
 the whole battery production 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.970
 bedroom array how much in the city 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.230
 precipitates lead 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.470
 found out in this lab today 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.569
 GEL 80 rub according to our results 

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:51.589
 the excess is like this 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:53.789
 a few there and a half to two 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.179
 1 ten twenty times sanitary epidemiology station 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:58.609
 assure lead evaporation concentration 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:00.190
 which environmentalists measured 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.039
 fix only on agricultural 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.100
 grounds and in the city take only samples 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.000
 its precipitation 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.390
 however regulations 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.550
 But now but it was not the form 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.270
 would help too have exceeded the number 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.160
 six cases 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.200
 insignificant environmentalists such 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.590
 statement is categorically not 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.380
 agree they say the most dangerous for 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.100
 human lead is not contained in the attack 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.600
 will it help to accumulate in 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.770
 in the body 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.740
 I always use plants 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.720
 cold war lead them 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.030
 ineffective and this leads to the fact that 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.900
 a pair of linden procession lead aerosols 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.510
 free move 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:37.970
 airspace 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.189
 single fraction of light pollution 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:41.770
 assures Vladimir Goncharenko 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.060
 come to the enterprise at 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.870
 production and processing 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.770
 There are several batteries in the city 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.790
 but show and filtering stimulus 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.680
 only agreed on one 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.110
 in technology us applied 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.710
 whose temperature is not higher than 500 degrees 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.020
 lead dowry temperature 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.040
 The shape of the fas can not be relative 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.240
 we were not in our technology 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.189
 all would say environmentalists but now 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:05.590
 New construction is underway 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.170
 recycling giant 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.179
 used 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.339
 and again the city limits open it 

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:12.689
 plan already by autumn for we are here though 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:15.279
 recycle up to 40 a thousand tons of batteries 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:16.349
 local authorities calm 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.339
 production is not dangerous hundreds and thousands 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:21.929
 thrown out switches 

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:23.470
 it is much more harmful 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.310
 what is the production that will be there 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.299
 convert 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.459
 however to find out the real picture 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.780
 lead load authorities want to bring 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.339
 global monitoring 

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:33.839
 by the way local research and 

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:35.379
 public health doctors 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:37.149
 organizations will begin this 

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:37.639
 year 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:39.279
 in order to determine the true 

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:41.609
 scale lead infection will be needed 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:43.529
 a lot of time for analysis 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:46.149
 hundreds of soil samples to be taken
