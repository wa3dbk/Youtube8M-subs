00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 and well hello to all that you are 41 for 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.610
 a video a bit special for a game in 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.690
 construction phase 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.660
 it's not me the creator I'm you 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:16.279
 reassure it's blade of ascension a game 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.109
 built from this online radar 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:21.600
 manga that gerard two or three times 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.590
 pretty much awesome and graphics 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.180
 were great for the manga I specify 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.830
 since it's only in beta test we do not 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.300
 can not do much except 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:37.590
 vaguely slightly on the map 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:42.660
 it will be a mmorpg game with which we 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:46.739
 can make guild wars makes a mmorpg 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:50.629
 sorry I have a little trouble really see 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.710
 already it's really there under beta test 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.829
 ccc the construction phase they we 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.559
 have just give limited access to the 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.949
 departure city they vaguely 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.110
 built but if they follow the 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.060
 examples of arte wishes online but 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.340
 this game knew how to be a bomb 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.360
 the characters are all not pierced 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.430
 so in clear we can go up on 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.930
 characters we can easily jump 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.880
 they offer us on their website 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:23.860
 official to finally show us 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.500
 what ideology can we know 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.490
 if they can not pimp is a little this 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.550
 that they created by a thing must 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:37.479
 to write in English 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:39.780
 and I had a lot of trouble keim really 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:44.310
 excuse me but see his graphics 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:47.440
 selah sue beta test it's already huge 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.420
 the manga I would put where the contribution of 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.810
 the eye it's called bÃ©diÃ© from this 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.850
 that I see the name of the manga I will put 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.119
 in the description there are only 4 episodes 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.619
 that can be seen in French subtitles 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.810
 and the rest is subtitled in 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:05.500
 English unfortunately I have a small 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.820
 little disappointed with that and look at me that they 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.610
 watched me air quality in 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:14.700
 its beta test what these limits of the rest 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.790
 knowing that she is soon in alpha co 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.019
 it's enormous 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.469
 after the council the observation lah 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.739
 principle 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:28.930
 the main thing of the game is actually 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:31.670
 kill monsters level up having 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:35.299
 oula oula oula oula of honor towards 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.739
 his fac know people do not do 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:41.269
 nonsense because in doubt we 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:43.090
 line we can do we can after 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:46.609
 lack of water can kill people 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.129
 is really but excuse me but this 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:50.959
 game is going out in a year I believe for 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.459
 the beta test and in two years for the 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.569
 official final version 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:59.239
 I believe and are still in the process of 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.430
 know who's going to be the beta testers and 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.319
 really i would like to be absolutely not 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.650
 what look at me these graphics 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.790
 a lot it's just a small piece 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.609
 in the manga the pigs are 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.239
 enemies can be read climbing up as high 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:15.049
 or shit what I did is 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:19.370
 really 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:20.090
 excuse me I besides you saw the 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.579
 grass quality 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.979
 finally the amount of mountain air all 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.299
 that in remaining range or we are 

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:29.030
 obliged to use an order for 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:31.750
 to remove laird to fight of 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:36.970
 shine in this manga cat 60 languages 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:39.409
 in this mmorpg I am at 60 and 61 fps 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.970
 with all that knowing that the chain the 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:42.769
 map it generate up to the bottom there 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:48.229
 it's up to it's bounded by the 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:51.139
 video is it is to abuse is really 

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:53.389
 but really it's the same creators 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:55.380
 finally for a moment these same creators 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:57.670
 who created 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:01.180
 a lot of players I remember more 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:06.040
 their name will be focused security finally for 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:09.100
 those whom I spent at the latest 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.570
 I remember the wolf team game 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.440
 with a werewolf a bit like slider 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:17.709
 it's the same creators who made 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.239
 really i'm in a hurry of the exit he 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:24.190
 are a lot of people who are also 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:28.210
 in a hurry and really this game it will be the 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:30.100
 bomb but a time bomb the 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.990
 by roger mmorpg who are not known they 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.260
 are going to have already it's going to be even less 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:40.320
 known because here is going to be a 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:45.250
 system of bosses bosses are going to go 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:46.870
 to be overpowered and precisely will not have to 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.610
 playing solo may still have 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.100
 friends so I hope I can count on 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.230
 you would like me to play with 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:56.080
 you too on a mmorpg game because 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:58.060
 all the mmorpg games that I played I 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.320
 have no person I knew 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.400
 or horse meat 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:07.000
 I did not have anybody that I did not 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.050
 knew I had to trust 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.600
 people I did not know 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:14.890
 since in fact I do not know and 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.750
 little precision before the end of this 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:20.990
 video 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:25.910
 this set this kind of an Olympus 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:28.520
 this kind of theater of what you 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:32.000

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:35.270
 this is where they are stuck who does not 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.230
 can never be the drop is 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.350
 besides, I would like it to be 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.520
 that in reality then applies and they 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:45.290
 will have to play with their men 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:48.350
 So I tell you next time 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:50.510
