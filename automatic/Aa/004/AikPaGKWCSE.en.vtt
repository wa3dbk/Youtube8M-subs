00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 yes 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.120
 with which such today we are going to make a 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.010
 trick to do a dye test 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.500
 to know if we have intolerance to 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:18.560
 dye if we get allergy or something we're going to 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.660
 use a tae tint that is from the 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.400
 Botanical line which are the new fruits 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.560
 that we have in the store or I'll visit 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.460
 I'll get a little product 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.529
 create 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.689
 It has a very comfortable format very well 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.059
 colorful pulo that gives a lot of attention 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.579
 It's cool because I'll talk a 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.620
 little bit of the dye the tip of botanique what 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.360
 good that it has is that it does not take anything nor 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.399
 ammonia or resort, which is what 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.670
 tends to give a little more intolerance in 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.559
 the dyes and also argan oil that 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.780
 is to nourish the scalp and the 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.839
 hair and they have also strengthened it with 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.940
 vegetable oils such as rice oil 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:57.510
 what it does is we look more at the 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.609
 color in the hair and also filter 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.289
 solar to help us that with 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.929
 the washes do not lose so much 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.810
 color and in addition we cover 100% gray 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:08.580
 sea ​​that is the great thing about this dye that 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.289
 not before those who do not carry ammonia 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.869
 it covers both the gray hair but if I do 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:15.179
 this one of fullan and that yes that covers it is worth 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.160
 let's also do a test with him 

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:19.560
 so you can see how the test is done 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.560
 of the dye first I'm going to clean up a little 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.070
 the area with alcohol ok let's do 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.530
 right in the fold of the elbow 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.659
 we clean a little with alcohol and go 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.600
 to clean what also pending 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.950
 behind the ear 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.780
 ok with a little bit of alcohol that is 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.360
 another area that we have very sensitive to 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.460
 do the test and 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.870
 the clients are presented then 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.230
 with the back that carries a 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.090
 appetite let's make the pressure to 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.880
 open the dye 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.950
 and then with a stick we take a 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.950
 little of the dye product 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.850
 and we will put it on the forearm as 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.070
 it had been said ok we put there a 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.130
 little bit of dye more 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.380
 you see a small amount serves us and 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.400
 Now we're going to take another little bit to 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.400
 put behind the ear 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.060
 and let it dry a little bit like 23 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.710
 minutes or so and we're going to 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.200
 repeat another relationship we put another 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:29.000
 small amount on the forearm and 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:32.030
 we put another amount behind the ear 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.830
 then later we would wait like 48 hours 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.500
 if it does not give us any kind of itch 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.570
 stinging or without redness in the area and we 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.990
 we could dye from that moment 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.930
 It's worth it if you get itching stinging sensation 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:47.240
 and especially that you redden a lot the 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.720
 area you have abundantly with 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.730
 retiráis water and to the worth and so and 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.860
 puts you less warned you not to 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.660
 let's use on the scalp that 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.310
 reactions are very very unpleasant 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.170
 begins to apply the whole head and the 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.820
 truth is that it is very unpleasant for 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.890
 that is usually done in the cave of 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.920
 dye when you use a new red 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.989
 that you do not know and if it is the first time 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.270
 that you are going to dye always do it in 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.400
 the dye test is worth the time 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.930
 is disputed and a little obscure in health 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.580
 so you do not have this kind of 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.010
 reactions that is very unpleasant as 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.290
