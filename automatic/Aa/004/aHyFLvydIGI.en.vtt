00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.529

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
so we don't offer unlimited but we do

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:58.090 
so we don't offer unlimited but we do
have<00:00:56.629> data<00:00:56.809> rollover<00:00:57.469> which<00:00:57.649> means<00:00:57.859> you're<00:00:58.010> on

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
have data rollover which means you're on

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.439 
have data rollover which means you're on
use<00:00:58.250> data<00:00:58.460> carries<00:00:58.789> over<00:00:58.910> to<00:00:59.000> the<00:00:59.059> next<00:00:59.149> month

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
use data carries over to the next month

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:01.180 
use data carries over to the next month
so<00:00:59.780> you'll<00:00:59.899> have<00:01:00.019> an<00:01:00.079> extra<00:01:00.170> data<00:01:00.500> set<00:01:00.949> like

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
so you'll have an extra data set like

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.799 
so you'll have an extra data set like
I'm<00:01:01.670> limited<00:01:02.180> not<00:01:02.359> really

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
I'm limited not really

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.450 
I'm limited not really

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
so let's say last month you used a

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.249 
so let's say last month you used a
portion<00:01:04.790> of<00:01:04.850> your<00:01:05.000> data<00:01:05.449> the<00:01:05.899> other<00:01:06.049> portion

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
portion of your data the other portion

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:07.719 
portion of your data the other portion
carries<00:01:06.740> over<00:01:06.890> but<00:01:07.220> you<00:01:07.310> have<00:01:07.430> to<00:01:07.520> use<00:01:07.610> the

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
carries over but you have to use the

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:09.160 
carries over but you have to use the
whole<00:01:07.880> portion<00:01:08.240> of<00:01:08.330> data<00:01:08.509> from<00:01:08.780> the<00:01:08.869> current
