00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799

affected grades in that class and in

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.620 
affected grades in that class and in
other<00:01:22.500> classes<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:23.220> at<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.490> time<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:24.000> my

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
other classes to at the time so my

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.990 
other classes to at the time so my
grades<00:01:24.869> slipped<00:01:25.320> just<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.890> little<00:01:26.250> bit<00:01:26.400> in<00:01:26.610> the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
grades slipped just a little bit in the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.200 
grades slipped just a little bit in the
middle<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.420> year<00:01:27.829> but<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:29.189> think<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.939> never

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
middle of the year but I think I I never

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.160 
middle of the year but I think I I never
got<00:01:30.360> anything<00:01:30.659> worse<00:01:31.110> than<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:32.060> be<00:01:33.060> i<00:01:33.390> think<00:01:33.689> or

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
got anything worse than a be i think or

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.780 
got anything worse than a be i think or
maybe<00:01:34.380> b-minus<00:01:35.040> i<00:01:35.369> don't<00:01:35.490> think<00:01:35.520> i<00:01:35.670> got

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
maybe b-minus i don't think i got

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.020 
maybe b-minus i don't think i got
anything<00:01:36.210> worse<00:01:36.450> than<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.920> so<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:37.950> think<00:01:38.189> my<00:01:38.579> i

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
anything worse than that so I think my i

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.310 
anything worse than that so I think my i
just<00:01:39.540> calculated<00:01:39.840> my<00:01:40.259> GPA<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:41.100> was<00:01:41.750> 3.8<00:01:42.750> so

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
just calculated my GPA it was 3.8 so

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.560 
just calculated my GPA it was 3.8 so
that's<00:01:43.530> like<00:01:43.649> an<00:01:43.770> a-minus<00:01:44.100> average<00:01:44.570> in

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
that's like an a-minus average in

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.130 
that's like an a-minus average in
freshman<00:01:46.200> year<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.590> pretty<00:01:47.310> easy<00:01:47.899> aside<00:01:48.899> from

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
freshman year is pretty easy aside from

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.830 
freshman year is pretty easy aside from
this<00:01:49.380> wacko<00:01:49.860> not<00:01:50.729> whacko<00:01:50.939> but<00:01:51.270> just<00:01:51.450> like<00:01:51.659> old

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
this wacko not whacko but just like old

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
was like a science test and like a lot

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:36.890 
was like a science test and like a lot
of<00:03:35.760> people<00:03:36.030> did<00:03:36.180> that<00:03:36.329> on<00:03:36.480> it<00:03:36.629> because<00:03:36.750> I<00:03:36.810> was

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
of people did that on it because I was

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.920 
of people did that on it because I was
like<00:03:37.019> chemistry<00:03:37.349> and<00:03:38.359> shits<00:03:39.359> shit's<00:03:39.840> pretty

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
like chemistry and shits shit's pretty

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.530 
like chemistry and shits shit's pretty
hard<00:03:40.260> chemistry<00:03:40.889> that<00:03:41.129> was<00:03:41.310> probably<00:03:41.940> one<00:03:42.510> of

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
hard chemistry that was probably one of

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.689 
hard chemistry that was probably one of
the<00:03:42.750> one<00:03:43.709> of<00:03:43.739> the<00:03:43.859> harder<00:03:44.129> classes<00:03:44.340> you<00:03:44.669> have

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:44.699 
the one of the harder classes you have

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:48.229 
the one of the harder classes you have
to<00:03:44.879> take<00:03:45.060> in<00:03:45.590> freshman<00:03:46.590> year<00:03:46.620> so<00:03:47.220> other<00:03:48.090> than

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
to take in freshman year so other than

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.789 
to take in freshman year so other than
that<00:03:48.449> everything<00:03:48.870> was<00:03:48.959> pretty<00:03:49.230> easy<00:03:49.290> except

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
that everything was pretty easy except

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.220 
that everything was pretty easy except
for<00:03:49.919> english<00:03:50.099> and<00:03:50.699> i<00:03:51.000> had<00:03:51.150> i<00:03:51.419> had<00:03:51.540> algebra<00:03:51.810> two

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
for english and i had i had algebra two

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.650 
for english and i had i had algebra two
and<00:03:52.440> english<00:03:52.799> the<00:03:52.949> same<00:03:53.220> quarter<00:03:53.760> which<00:03:54.389> was

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
and english the same quarter which was

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.559 
and english the same quarter which was
terrible<00:03:55.230> for<00:03:55.500> me<00:03:55.819> because<00:03:56.819> i<00:03:56.849> feel<00:03:57.209> like<00:03:57.329> if<00:03:57.449> i

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
terrible for me because i feel like if i

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.140 
terrible for me because i feel like if i
had<00:03:57.780> them<00:03:57.989> separate<00:03:58.579> separate<00:03:59.579> quarters<00:04:00.000> I

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
had them separate separate quarters I

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.750 
had them separate separate quarters I
would've<00:04:00.419> done<00:04:00.480> fine<00:04:00.780> dandy<00:04:01.169> but<00:04:01.590> having<00:04:02.099> both

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
would've done fine dandy but having both

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.699 
would've done fine dandy but having both
of<00:04:03.030> them<00:04:03.150> at<00:04:03.239> the<00:04:03.269> same<00:04:03.389> time<00:04:03.810> that's<00:04:04.230> it's

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
of them at the same time that's it's

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.740 
of them at the same time that's it's
just<00:04:05.010> too<00:04:05.099> much<00:04:05.220> it's<00:04:05.639> fucking<00:04:06.329> nuclear

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
just too much it's fucking nuclear

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.000 
just too much it's fucking nuclear

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
overload um and next year I'm takin a

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.280 
overload um and next year I'm takin a
lot<00:04:11.340> of<00:04:11.609> classes<00:04:12.329> trying<00:04:12.569> to<00:04:12.690> figure<00:04:12.930> out<00:04:12.989> what

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
i'm probably gonna have to start

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.840 
i'm probably gonna have to start
studying<00:05:42.170> for<00:05:42.500> tests<00:05:43.010> because<00:05:43.160> it's<00:05:43.550> a<00:05:43.640> bad

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:43.850 
studying for tests because it's a bad

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.150 
studying for tests because it's a bad
habit<00:05:43.880> of<00:05:44.240> mine<00:05:44.300> to<00:05:44.990> not<00:05:45.140> study<00:05:45.500> because<00:05:46.130> I

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
habit of mine to not study because I

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.550 
habit of mine to not study because I
feel<00:05:46.670> like<00:05:46.820> I<00:05:47.000> already<00:05:47.270> know<00:05:47.450> everything<00:05:47.750> I<00:05:48.200> I

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
feel like I already know everything I I

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.440 
feel like I already know everything I I
basically<00:05:49.010> I<00:05:49.280> just<00:05:49.550> retain<00:05:50.150> information

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 
basically I just retain information

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.590 
basically I just retain information
pretty<00:05:50.930> well<00:05:51.460> but<00:05:52.460> I<00:05:52.790> don't<00:05:53.330> think<00:05:53.480> that's

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 
pretty well but I don't think that's

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.630 
pretty well but I don't think that's
gonna<00:05:53.930> work<00:05:54.050> throughout<00:05:55.040> my<00:05:55.220> whole<00:05:55.370> high

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:55.640 
gonna work throughout my whole high

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.130 
gonna work throughout my whole high
school<00:05:55.670> so<00:05:56.000> I<00:05:56.030> gotta<00:05:56.240> start<00:05:56.510> studying<00:05:56.660> and

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:57.140 
school so I gotta start studying and

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.050 
school so I gotta start studying and
actually<00:05:57.830> trying<00:05:58.130> harder<00:05:58.580> in<00:05:58.700> my<00:05:58.730> classes

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060 
actually trying harder in my classes

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.730 
actually trying harder in my classes
like<00:05:59.330> I<00:05:59.420> feel<00:05:59.660> like<00:05:59.690> I<00:05:59.900> probably<00:06:00.230> could<00:06:00.560> have<00:06:00.590> a

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
like I feel like I probably could have a

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.580 
like I feel like I probably could have a
four-point-oh<00:06:01.490> but<00:06:01.880> instead<00:06:02.330> I've<00:06:02.450> got<00:06:02.600> a<00:06:02.630> 3.8

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:03.590 
four-point-oh but instead I've got a 3.8

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.740 
four-point-oh but instead I've got a 3.8
which<00:06:03.710> is<00:06:03.860> isn't<00:06:04.190> isn't<00:06:04.820> a<00:06:05.090> huge<00:06:05.390> difference

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:05.750 
which is isn't isn't a huge difference

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.240 
which is isn't isn't a huge difference
but<00:06:06.320> I<00:06:06.590> mean<00:06:06.970> why<00:06:07.970> would<00:06:08.180> I<00:06:08.210> have<00:06:08.390> something

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
but I mean why would I have something

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.940 
but I mean why would I have something
like<00:06:10.250> lower<00:06:10.490> if<00:06:10.730> I<00:06:10.820> if<00:06:11.090> I<00:06:11.240> could<00:06:11.480> do<00:06:11.600> better<00:06:11.950> so

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:12.950 
like lower if I if I could do better so

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.830 
like lower if I if I could do better so
I<00:06:13.250> don't<00:06:13.490> know<00:06:13.580> I'm<00:06:13.820> just<00:06:14.270> a<00:06:14.360> little<00:06:14.480> random

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 
I don't know I'm just a little random

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.870 
I don't know I'm just a little random
commentary<00:06:15.260> talking<00:06:15.590> about<00:06:15.740> school<00:06:16.190> my<00:06:16.580> how

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 
commentary talking about school my how

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.850 
commentary talking about school my how
my<00:06:17.030> years<00:06:17.300> went<00:06:17.600> it's<00:06:17.870> been<00:06:18.110> it's<00:06:18.380> been<00:06:18.470> really

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.860 
my years went it's been it's been really

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.920 
my years went it's been it's been really
easy<00:06:19.010> the<00:06:19.610> the<00:06:20.000> second<00:06:20.390> half<00:06:20.570> of<00:06:20.690> school

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:20.930 
easy the the second half of school

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.810 
easy the the second half of school
that's<00:06:21.170> why<00:06:21.290> I<00:06:21.320> don't<00:06:21.560> get<00:06:21.770> so<00:06:22.310> they<00:06:22.490> make<00:06:22.670> my

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:22.820 
that's why I don't get so they make my

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.430
