the field as long as possible this is
actually<00:03:07.519> one<00:03:07.639> of<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:07.790> units<00:03:08.030> that<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.150> fans

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
actually one of the units that the fans

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.030 
really requested on the boards after C&amp;C
3<00:03:10.790> so<00:03:11.299> we're<00:03:11.750> happy<00:03:12.079> to<00:03:12.200> implement<00:03:12.650> it<00:03:12.829> and

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
3 so we're happy to implement it and

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.190 
3 so we're happy to implement it and
kind<00:03:13.340> of<00:03:13.430> fill<00:03:13.670> that<00:03:13.849> gap<00:03:14.120> in<00:03:14.420> a<00:03:14.450> GD<00:03:15.109> eyes

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
kind of fill that gap in a GD eyes

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.229 
kind of fill that gap in a GD eyes
combat<00:03:15.680> chain<00:03:15.920> unfortunately<00:03:16.760> every<00:03:16.940> unit

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
combat chain unfortunately every unit

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.030 
combat chain unfortunately every unit
has<00:03:17.269> their<00:03:17.690> weakness<00:03:18.079> in<00:03:18.260> the<00:03:18.319> hammerheads<00:03:18.799> is

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
has their weakness in the hammerheads is

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.069 
has their weakness in the hammerheads is
also<00:03:19.430> against<00:03:19.790> ant<00:03:20.000> against<00:03:20.540> that<00:03:20.659> aircraft

also against ant against that aircraft

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:22.809 
also against ant against that aircraft
it<00:03:21.319> doesn't<00:03:21.560> have<00:03:21.650> any<00:03:21.799> natural<00:03:22.069> anti-air

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
it doesn't have any natural anti-air

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.449 
it doesn't have any natural anti-air
defenses<00:03:23.090> you<00:03:23.900> know<00:03:23.989> in<00:03:24.260> fact<00:03:24.500> GDI<00:03:24.920> is<00:03:25.040> a<00:03:25.159> hole

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
defenses you know in fact GDI is a hole

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.670 
defenses you know in fact GDI is a hole
in<00:03:25.849> Stan's<00:03:26.239> III<00:03:26.629> didn't<00:03:26.959> have<00:03:27.109> a<00:03:27.139> very<00:03:27.439> strong

in Stan's III didn't have a very strong
anti-air<00:03:28.340> game<00:03:28.670> so<00:03:29.180> to<00:03:29.209> fill<00:03:29.510> that<00:03:29.689> gap<00:03:29.959> we're

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
anti-air game so to fill that gap we're

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.660 
anti-air game so to fill that gap we're
adding<00:03:30.650> another<00:03:30.799> one<00:03:31.010> of<00:03:31.099> our<00:03:31.159> brand<00:03:31.519> new

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
adding another one of our brand new

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.080 
adding another one of our brand new
units<00:03:32.000> and<00:03:32.120> this<00:03:32.209> is<00:03:32.359> the<00:03:32.510> GDI<00:03:33.200> slingshot

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
hover tank so just like we're bridging

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.869 
hover tank so just like we're bridging
some<00:03:54.799> of<00:03:54.889> that<00:03:54.980> fiction<00:03:55.430> between<00:03:55.760> the

Tiberian Sun era and cnc three rules

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.520 
Tiberian Sun era and cnc three rules
have<00:03:59.090> bridging<00:03:59.419> some<00:03:59.629> of<00:03:59.690> that<00:03:59.780> technology<00:03:59.989> so

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
have bridging some of that technology so

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.199 
have bridging some of that technology so
we're<00:04:00.709> bringing<00:04:00.889> back<00:04:01.280> that<00:04:01.549> hover

we're bringing back that hover

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.330 
we're bringing back that hover

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
technology which fans have requested for

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.939 
technology which fans have requested for
quite<00:04:04.549> a<00:04:04.579> long<00:04:04.669> time<00:04:04.790> now<00:04:05.479> as<00:04:05.690> a<00:04:05.720> hovertank<00:04:06.199> the

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:06.949 
quite a long time now as a hovertank the

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:09.039 
quite a long time now as a hovertank the
anti-air<00:04:07.579> Scout<00:04:07.879> is<00:04:08.030> a<00:04:08.060> bit<00:04:08.239> faster<00:04:08.750> than<00:04:08.780> your

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
anti-air Scout is a bit faster than your

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:10.750 
anti-air Scout is a bit faster than your
average<00:04:09.199> a<00:04:09.590> treaded<00:04:10.010> tank<00:04:10.250> like<00:04:10.430> the<00:04:10.549> predator

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
average a treaded tank like the predator

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.530 
average a treaded tank like the predator
or<00:04:11.150> the<00:04:11.479> mammut<00:04:11.930> but<00:04:12.470> I<00:04:13.449> unfortunately<00:04:14.449> that

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
or the mammut but I unfortunately that

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.479 
or the mammut but I unfortunately that
resulted<00:04:14.989> in<00:04:15.079> having<00:04:15.349> a<00:04:15.409> bit<00:04:15.590> lower<00:04:15.799> armor<00:04:16.310> so

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
resulted in having a bit lower armor so

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.129 
resulted in having a bit lower armor so
as<00:04:16.579> they<00:04:16.669> come<00:04:16.849> across<00:04:17.090> and<00:04:17.479> meet<00:04:17.810> troops

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
as they come across and meet troops

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:19.060 
as they come across and meet troops
they're<00:04:18.380> not<00:04:18.500> going<00:04:18.620> to<00:04:18.680> be<00:04:18.739> able<00:04:18.769> to<00:04:18.949> hold

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
they're not going to be able to hold

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.439 
they're not going to be able to hold
their<00:04:19.220> own<00:04:19.310> so<00:04:19.519> they're<00:04:19.639> actually<00:04:19.789> more<00:04:20.269> of<00:04:20.329> a

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:20.449 
their own so they're actually more of a

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:22.270 
their own so they're actually more of a
support<00:04:20.630> type<00:04:21.079> of<00:04:21.229> unit<00:04:21.440> able<00:04:21.979> to<00:04:22.039> chase<00:04:22.250> down

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
support type of unit able to chase down

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.980 
support type of unit able to chase down
those<00:04:22.669> aircraft<00:04:23.090> but<00:04:23.300> you<00:04:23.659> know<00:04:23.750> they're<00:04:23.960> not

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
those aircraft but you know they're not

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.760 
those aircraft but you know they're not
really<00:04:24.289> solo<00:04:24.770> type<00:04:25.010> units

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
really solo type units

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.080 
really solo type units
and<00:04:25.889> the<00:04:26.190> other<00:04:26.310> unfortunate<00:04:26.910> thing<00:04:27.060> about

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
and the other unfortunate thing about

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.140 
and the other unfortunate thing about
the<00:04:27.720> a<00:04:27.750> scout<00:04:28.440> is<00:04:28.650> that<00:04:28.860> well<00:04:29.160> it's<00:04:29.190> only<00:04:29.970> a<00:04:30.000> a

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
the a scout is that well it's only a a

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.360 
the a scout is that well it's only a a
so<00:04:30.599> as<00:04:30.720> it<00:04:30.750> comes<00:04:31.050> up<00:04:31.289> against<00:04:31.949> these<00:04:32.009> ground

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
so as it comes up against these ground

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.029 
so as it comes up against these ground
troops<00:04:32.610> that<00:04:32.729> really<00:04:33.000> can't<00:04:33.270> hold<00:04:33.479> its<00:04:33.629> own<00:04:34.039> so

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:35.039 
troops that really can't hold its own so

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:37.399 
troops that really can't hold its own so

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
defended by anti-aircraft turret so my

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.640 
defended by anti-aircraft turret so my
orcas<00:05:12.690> aren't<00:05:12.900> really<00:05:13.080> going<00:05:13.229> to<00:05:13.349> be<00:05:13.440> able<00:05:13.590> to

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
orcas aren't really going to be able to

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.710 
orcas aren't really going to be able to
crack<00:05:13.979> the<00:05:14.190> space<00:05:14.430> i<00:05:14.580> may<00:05:14.699> need<00:05:14.880> to<00:05:14.940> bring<00:05:15.210> in<00:05:15.419> a

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
crack the space i may need to bring in a

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.260 
crack the space i may need to bring in a
mix<00:05:16.229> of<00:05:16.380> some<00:05:16.560> of<00:05:16.650> our<00:05:16.740> new<00:05:16.949> units<00:05:17.340> so<00:05:17.909> as<00:05:18.030> we<00:05:18.120> go

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
mix of some of our new units so as we go

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.120 
mix of some of our new units so as we go
back<00:05:18.539> you'll<00:05:19.020> see<00:05:19.110> I'm<00:05:19.319> bringing<00:05:19.680> in<00:05:19.770> more<00:05:19.979> of

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
back you'll see I'm bringing in more of

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.520 
back you'll see I'm bringing in more of
those<00:05:20.250> hammerhead<00:05:20.789> gunships<00:05:21.300> and<00:05:21.539> also<00:05:22.349> new

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
those hammerhead gunships and also new

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:23.869 
those hammerhead gunships and also new
yet<00:05:22.680> that<00:05:22.860> I'll<00:05:22.919> introduce<00:05:22.949> in<00:05:23.340> a<00:05:23.430> few<00:05:23.610> in<00:05:23.789> a

00:05:23.869 --> 00:05:23.879 
yet that I'll introduce in a few in a

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:25.700 
yet that I'll introduce in a few in a
few<00:05:24.060> seconds<00:05:24.479> but<00:05:24.870> the<00:05:25.080> other<00:05:25.229> really<00:05:25.440> cool

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
few seconds but the other really cool

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:26.990 
few seconds but the other really cool
thing<00:05:25.919> about<00:05:25.979> the<00:05:26.129> Hammerhead<00:05:26.550> that<00:05:26.669> I<00:05:26.729> didn't

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
thing about the Hammerhead that I didn't

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.309 
thing about the Hammerhead that I didn't
mention<00:05:27.180> before<00:05:27.449> is<00:05:27.690> that<00:05:27.840> it<00:05:28.050> can<00:05:28.139> actually

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:28.319 
mention before is that it can actually

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:31.070 
mention before is that it can actually
garrison<00:05:29.069> another<00:05:29.909> infantry<00:05:30.419> unit<00:05:30.659> in<00:05:30.780> size

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
garrison another infantry unit in size

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.170 
garrison another infantry unit in size
so<00:05:31.740> as<00:05:31.860> I<00:05:31.949> move<00:05:32.159> these<00:05:32.310> different<00:05:32.699> units<00:05:33.000> in

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
so as I move these different units in

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.930 
so as I move these different units in
the<00:05:34.139> hammerhead<00:05:34.590> is<00:05:34.620> going<00:05:34.919> to<00:05:35.009> gain<00:05:35.340> the

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
the hammerhead is going to gain the

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.570 
the hammerhead is going to gain the
extra<00:05:36.449> firepower<00:05:36.949> from<00:05:37.949> those<00:05:38.159> infantry

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
extra firepower from those infantry

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.969 
extra firepower from those infantry
units<00:05:38.880> so<00:05:39.000> if<00:05:39.090> i<00:05:39.210> put<00:05:39.240> zoe<00:05:40.229> troopers<00:05:40.650> in<00:05:40.800> there

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
units so if i put zoe troopers in there

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:42.559 
units so if i put zoe troopers in there
it<00:05:41.099> will<00:05:41.159> be<00:05:41.279> able<00:05:41.370> to<00:05:41.520> fire<00:05:41.759> rail<00:05:42.060> guns<00:05:42.330> down

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:42.569 
it will be able to fire rail guns down

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:44.719 
it will be able to fire rail guns down
from<00:05:42.750> the<00:05:42.840> sky<00:05:43.080> I<00:05:43.409> put<00:05:43.889> Grenadier<00:05:44.400> xin<00:05:44.610> there

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
from the sky I put Grenadier xin there

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:45.980 
from the sky I put Grenadier xin there
they're<00:05:44.909> going<00:05:45.029> to<00:05:45.090> chuck<00:05:45.330> grenades<00:05:45.690> out<00:05:45.870> the

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
they're going to chuck grenades out the

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.019 
they're going to chuck grenades out the
window<00:05:46.319> and<00:05:46.710> if<00:05:46.860> I<00:05:46.979> put<00:05:47.190> maybe<00:05:47.370> some<00:05:47.669> rocket

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:48.029 
window and if I put maybe some rocket

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:49.700 
window and if I put maybe some rocket
troops<00:05:48.300> in<00:05:48.449> there<00:05:48.630> it<00:05:49.050> might<00:05:49.229> actually<00:05:49.409> give

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
troops in there it might actually give

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.620 
troops in there it might actually give
it<00:05:49.800> a<00:05:49.860> little<00:05:49.979> bit<00:05:50.190> of<00:05:50.340> anti<00:05:51.060> air<00:05:51.210> defense

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
it a little bit of anti air defense

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.540 
it a little bit of anti air defense
since<00:05:52.319> Rockets<00:05:52.710> can<00:05:52.830> shoot<00:05:53.039> both<00:05:53.190> ground<00:05:53.460> and

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
since Rockets can shoot both ground and

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.670 
since Rockets can shoot both ground and
air<00:05:53.759> so<00:05:54.150> you<00:05:54.210> have<00:05:54.360> a<00:05:54.389> lot<00:05:54.630> of<00:05:54.680> customizable

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
air so you have a lot of customizable

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.589 
air so you have a lot of customizable
options<00:05:55.830> with<00:05:56.370> this<00:05:56.550> new<00:05:56.729> hammer<00:05:56.969> head<00:05:57.240> unit

00:05:57.589 --> 00:05:57.599 
options with this new hammer head unit

00:05:57.599 --> 00:05:59.269 
options with this new hammer head unit
that's<00:05:58.020> really<00:05:58.229> going<00:05:58.409> to<00:05:58.469> make<00:05:58.650> it<00:05:58.770> versatile

00:05:59.269 --> 00:05:59.279 
that's really going to make it versatile

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:01.670 
that's really going to make it versatile
for<00:05:59.639> a<00:05:59.669> GD<00:06:00.060> eyes<00:06:00.150> air<00:06:00.449> game<00:06:00.719> so<00:06:01.349> I<00:06:01.380> won't<00:06:01.590> be

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
for a GD eyes air game so I won't be

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.110 
for a GD eyes air game so I won't be
able<00:06:01.770> to<00:06:01.919> take<00:06:02.099> in<00:06:02.250> these<00:06:02.370> hammerheads<00:06:02.699> just

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
able to take in these hammerheads just

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.790 
able to take in these hammerheads just
yet<00:06:03.360> due<00:06:03.539> to<00:06:03.630> those<00:06:03.750> nod<00:06:04.139> anti-aircraft

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
yet due to those nod anti-aircraft

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.200 
yet due to those nod anti-aircraft
turrets<00:06:05.370> I'm<00:06:05.460> gonna<00:06:05.580> need<00:06:05.639> something<00:06:06.000> on<00:06:06.120> the

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
turrets I'm gonna need something on the

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.059 
turrets I'm gonna need something on the
ground<00:06:06.479> to<00:06:06.719> take<00:06:06.900> those<00:06:07.110> out<00:06:07.259> and<00:06:07.529> to<00:06:07.800> do<00:06:07.919> that

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:08.069 
ground to take those out and to do that

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:09.140 
ground to take those out and to do that
we're<00:06:08.250> going<00:06:08.340> to<00:06:08.400> use<00:06:08.460> another<00:06:08.819> one<00:06:09.000> of<00:06:09.090> our

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
we're going to use another one of our

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.330 
we're going to use another one of our
brand<00:06:09.539> new<00:06:09.719> units<00:06:10.080> this<00:06:10.199> is<00:06:10.259> the<00:06:10.469> GDI<00:06:10.800> shatter

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 
brand new units this is the GDI shatter

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.760 
brand new units this is the GDI shatter
and<00:06:11.699> again<00:06:12.389> this<00:06:12.539> is<00:06:12.659> a<00:06:12.690> hover<00:06:12.990> vehicle<00:06:13.560> to

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
and again this is a hover vehicle to

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:14.839 
and again this is a hover vehicle to
kind<00:06:13.949> of<00:06:13.979> bring<00:06:14.219> some<00:06:14.460> of<00:06:14.520> that<00:06:14.550> technology

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:14.849 
kind of bring some of that technology

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:17.600 
kind of bring some of that technology
back<00:06:15.509> again<00:06:16.349> makes<00:06:16.590> it<00:06:16.740> a<00:06:16.800> bit<00:06:16.949> faster<00:06:17.430> but<00:06:17.580> a

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
back again makes it a bit faster but a

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.430 
back again makes it a bit faster but a
bit<00:06:17.789> more<00:06:17.940> lightly<00:06:18.240> armored<00:06:18.750> and<00:06:18.870> the<00:06:19.199> shadow

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 
bit more lightly armored and the shadow

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.620 
bit more lightly armored and the shadow
is<00:06:19.560> really<00:06:19.889> cool<00:06:20.039> because<00:06:20.310> it<00:06:20.819> actually<00:06:21.150> takes

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 
is really cool because it actually takes

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.629 
is really cool because it actually takes
the<00:06:21.750> sonic<00:06:22.199> emitter<00:06:22.469> weapon<00:06:22.979> that<00:06:23.400> was<00:06:23.580> a

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639 
the sonic emitter weapon that was a

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:25.399 
the sonic emitter weapon that was a
popular<00:06:24.000> defensive<00:06:24.659> weapon<00:06:24.960> in<00:06:25.050> cnc<00:06:25.380> three

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:25.409 
popular defensive weapon in cnc three

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:27.649 
popular defensive weapon in cnc three
and<00:06:25.860> now<00:06:26.250> we<00:06:26.310> put<00:06:26.610> it<00:06:26.699> on<00:06:26.759> a<00:06:26.819> natural<00:06:27.300> vehicle

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:27.659 
and now we put it on a natural vehicle

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:28.980 
and now we put it on a natural vehicle
to<00:06:27.750> make<00:06:27.870> it<00:06:27.990> mobile<00:06:28.169> in<00:06:28.409> the<00:06:28.469> deal

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990 
to make it mobile in the deal

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.080 
to make it mobile in the deal
and<00:06:29.110> if<00:06:29.530> you<00:06:29.650> remember<00:06:29.860> the<00:06:30.130> really<00:06:30.850> cool

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.090 
and if you remember the really cool

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:35.430 
and if you remember the really cool
thing<00:06:32.460> about<00:06:33.460> the<00:06:34.450> sonic<00:06:34.810> weapon<00:06:35.140> is<00:06:35.230> that<00:06:35.260> if

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 
thing about the sonic weapon is that if

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.410 
thing about the sonic weapon is that if
you<00:06:35.500> can<00:06:35.650> line<00:06:35.950> up<00:06:35.980> your<00:06:36.160> shots<00:06:36.670> you<00:06:37.270> can

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:37.420 
you can line up your shots you can

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.720
