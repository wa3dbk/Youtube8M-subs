00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.650 
of this redstone will remain dark red
because<00:02:09.610> it<00:02:09.759> has<00:02:09.850> not<00:02:10.000> turned<00:02:10.210> on<00:02:10.360> at<00:02:10.570> this

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
because it has not turned on at this

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.560 
because it has not turned on at this
point<00:02:11.400> now<00:02:12.400> you<00:02:12.820> want<00:02:12.970> to<00:02:13.000> go<00:02:13.120> ahead<00:02:13.240> and

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
point now you want to go ahead and

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:19.070 
point now you want to go ahead and
extend<00:02:14.020> out<00:02:15.300> each<00:02:16.300> of<00:02:16.540> your<00:02:16.720> redstone<00:02:17.350> wires

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
extend out each of your redstone wires

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.510 
extend out each of your redstone wires
and<00:02:20.080> go<00:02:21.040> ahead<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:21.370> bring<00:02:21.550> these<00:02:23.340> bring<00:02:24.340> these

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
way out without busting through is to

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:36.200 
way out without busting through is to
just<00:04:34.500> place<00:04:34.680> a<00:04:34.710> little<00:04:34.889> button<00:04:35.280> right<00:04:35.460> here<00:04:35.759> to

just place a little button right here to

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.879 
just place a little button right here to
the<00:04:36.300> right<00:04:36.330> of<00:04:36.600> the<00:04:36.660> door<00:04:36.840> you<00:04:37.560> don't<00:04:37.620> want<00:04:37.830> to

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
the right of the door you don't want to

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:39.529 
the right of the door you don't want to
place<00:04:38.039> it<00:04:38.190> on<00:04:38.280> the<00:04:38.400> left<00:04:38.430> because<00:04:38.910> we'll<00:04:39.449> go

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 
place it on the left because we'll go

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:41.659 
place it on the left because we'll go
through<00:04:39.810> here<00:04:40.050> and<00:04:40.259> you<00:04:40.889> can<00:04:41.039> hide<00:04:41.250> the

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
through here and you can hide the

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.839 
through here and you can hide the
circuit<00:04:42.030> just<00:04:42.539> by<00:04:42.690> doing<00:04:42.960> that<00:04:43.139> so<00:04:43.729> if<00:04:44.729> you

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:44.849 
circuit just by doing that so if you

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:47.390 
circuit just by doing that so if you
place<00:04:45.060> the<00:04:45.210> button<00:04:45.419> on<00:04:45.570> the<00:04:45.690> right<00:04:45.840> side<00:04:46.400> the

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
place the button on the right side the

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.920 
place the button on the right side the
door<00:04:47.580> will<00:04:47.729> open<00:04:47.759> right<00:04:48.120> up<00:04:48.270> and<00:04:48.419> you<00:04:48.509> can<00:04:48.690> run

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
door will open right up and you can run

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.810 
door will open right up and you can run
out<00:04:48.960> and<00:04:49.530> you<00:04:49.770> can<00:04:49.919> still<00:04:50.070> get<00:04:50.310> through<00:04:50.490> on<00:04:50.699> the

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
out and you can still get through on the

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.260 
out and you can still get through on the
outside<00:04:51.590> now<00:04:52.590> to<00:04:53.099> hide<00:04:53.310> the<00:04:53.460> redstone<00:04:53.910> so<00:04:54.180> you

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
outside now to hide the redstone so you

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.969 
outside now to hide the redstone so you
can't<00:04:54.479> see<00:04:54.720> it<00:04:55.250> all<00:04:56.250> you<00:04:56.430> do<00:04:56.610> is<00:04:57.240> dig<00:04:57.570> out

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
can't see it all you do is dig out

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:00.980 
can't see it all you do is dig out
blocks<00:04:58.979> just<00:04:59.130> like<00:04:59.370> this<00:04:59.729> dig<00:05:00.419> out<00:05:00.570> the<00:05:00.750> block

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
blocks just like this dig out the block

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.490 
blocks just like this dig out the block
right<00:05:01.320> under<00:05:01.560> the<00:05:01.680> redstone<00:05:02.070> torch<00:05:03.139> and<00:05:04.139> go

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
right under the redstone torch and go

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.439 
right under the redstone torch and go
ahead<00:05:04.770> and<00:05:05.070> go<00:05:05.400> down<00:05:06.800> one<00:05:07.800> more<00:05:07.830> so<00:05:08.430> you'll<00:05:09.120> end

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:09.449 
ahead and go down one more so you'll end

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:11.839 
ahead and go down one more so you'll end
up<00:05:09.780> going<00:05:10.110> down<00:05:10.139> two<00:05:10.650> blocks<00:05:10.830> below<00:05:11.370> the<00:05:11.669> door

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:11.849 
up going down two blocks below the door

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:16.010 
up going down two blocks below the door
and<00:05:12.500> bring<00:05:13.500> it<00:05:13.590> around<00:05:13.710> this<00:05:14.010> corner<00:05:14.840> and<00:05:15.840> go

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
and bring it around this corner and go

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.350 
and bring it around this corner and go
ahead<00:05:16.169> and<00:05:16.320> dig<00:05:16.440> out<00:05:16.620> all<00:05:16.830> the<00:05:17.130> blocks<00:05:17.370> until

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
ahead and dig out all the blocks until

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.110 
ahead and dig out all the blocks until
you<00:05:18.449> get<00:05:18.570> right<00:05:18.780> underneath<00:05:19.490> this<00:05:20.490> block<00:05:20.820> that

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
you get right underneath this block that

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.170 
you get right underneath this block that
is<00:05:21.180> under<00:05:21.570> the<00:05:21.690> button<00:05:22.580> now<00:05:23.580> under<00:05:23.849> the<00:05:23.970> block

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
is under the button now under the block

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.879 
is under the button now under the block
of<00:05:24.360> the<00:05:24.419> button<00:05:24.659> place<00:05:24.960> one<00:05:25.199> redstone<00:05:25.440> and

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
of the button place one redstone and

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:27.320 
of the button place one redstone and
then<00:05:26.130> place<00:05:26.340> a<00:05:26.490> repeater<00:05:26.639> on<00:05:27.060> the<00:05:27.150> block

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
then place a repeater on the block

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.500 
then place a repeater on the block
before<00:05:27.539> that<00:05:27.900> this<00:05:28.710> will<00:05:28.889> allow<00:05:29.250> us<00:05:29.460> to<00:05:29.510> cover

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
before that this will allow us to cover

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.370 
before that this will allow us to cover
that<00:05:30.750> hole<00:05:31.099> without<00:05:32.099> pinching<00:05:32.340> the<00:05:32.729> line<00:05:33.380> then

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
that hole without pinching the line then

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.670 
that hole without pinching the line then
connect<00:05:34.830> the<00:05:35.009> rest<00:05:35.190> of<00:05:35.490> the<00:05:35.580> redstone<00:05:36.000> and<00:05:36.680> you

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
connect the rest of the redstone and you

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.149 
connect the rest of the redstone and you
can<00:05:37.830> cover<00:05:38.039> this<00:05:38.220> stuff<00:05:38.460> up<00:05:39.860> make<00:05:40.860> sure<00:05:40.889> you

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:41.159 
can cover this stuff up make sure you

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:42.620 
can cover this stuff up make sure you
don't<00:05:41.190> cover<00:05:41.580> this<00:05:41.849> part<00:05:42.090> though<00:05:42.270> or<00:05:42.570> you'll

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
don't cover this part though or you'll

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.249 
don't cover this part though or you'll
pinch<00:05:43.110> that<00:05:43.289> line<00:05:43.530> and<00:05:43.860> it<00:05:43.979> won't<00:05:44.099> work<00:05:44.190> so<00:05:45.259> now

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:46.259 
pinch that line and it won't work so now

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:49.129 
pinch that line and it won't work so now
let's<00:05:46.530> go<00:05:46.650> ahead<00:05:46.800> and<00:05:46.919> test<00:05:47.070> it

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139 
let's go ahead and test it

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:52.949 
let's go ahead and test it
and<00:05:50.139> it<00:05:50.289> still<00:05:50.529> works<00:05:50.769> so<00:05:51.419> now<00:05:52.419> you<00:05:52.479> can<00:05:52.779> come

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:52.959 
and it still works so now you can come

00:05:52.959 --> 00:06:00.329 
and it still works so now you can come
through<00:05:53.110> here<00:05:53.529> and<00:05:54.629> block<00:05:55.629> off<00:05:55.869> this<00:05:58.439> and<00:05:59.439> you

00:06:00.329 --> 00:06:00.339 
through here and block off this and you

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:02.159 
through here and block off this and you
can<00:06:00.489> just<00:06:00.519> make<00:06:01.239> whatever<00:06:01.509> you<00:06:01.809> want<00:06:01.839> out<00:06:02.110> of

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:02.169 
can just make whatever you want out of

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:04.739 
can just make whatever you want out of
this<00:06:02.489> you<00:06:03.489> can<00:06:03.639> go<00:06:03.789> through<00:06:04.029> here<00:06:04.059> and<00:06:04.389> open

00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:04.749 
this you can go through here and open

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:07.949 
this you can go through here and open
this<00:06:04.869> up<00:06:05.079> and<00:06:06.089> you'll<00:06:07.089> never<00:06:07.269> be<00:06:07.509> able<00:06:07.629> to<00:06:07.719> see

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:07.959 
this up and you'll never be able to see

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:12.269 
this up and you'll never be able to see
all<00:06:08.319> the<00:06:08.919> circuitry<00:06:09.369> over<00:06:09.610> here<00:06:09.819> and<00:06:11.099> our<00:06:12.099> lock

00:06:12.269 --> 00:06:12.279 
all the circuitry over here and our lock

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:16.079 
all the circuitry over here and our lock
still<00:06:12.610> works<00:06:12.849> so<00:06:14.369> that's<00:06:15.369> how<00:06:15.610> you<00:06:15.669> make<00:06:15.909> a

00:06:16.079 --> 00:06:16.089 
still works so that's how you make a

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:20.399 
still works so that's how you make a
combination<00:06:16.479> lock<00:06:16.959> in<00:06:18.119> Minecraft<00:06:19.199> if<00:06:20.199> this
