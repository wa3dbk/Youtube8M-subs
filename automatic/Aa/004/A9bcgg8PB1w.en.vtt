here<00:00:10.950> we<00:00:11.040> have<00:00:11.220> a<00:00:11.250> half<00:00:11.490> mortise<00:00:11.910> lock<00:00:12.000> set

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
here we have a half mortise lock set

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.050 
here we have a half mortise lock set
this<00:00:13.290> is<00:00:13.470> meant<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.710> be<00:00:13.860> installed<00:00:14.280> with<00:00:14.760> one

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:15.060 
this is meant to be installed with one

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.269 
this is meant to be installed with one
side<00:00:15.330> exposed<00:00:16.139> on<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.770> inside<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.220> the

side exposed on the inside of the

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.970 
side exposed on the inside of the
cabinet<00:00:17.700> I<00:00:17.910> didn't<00:00:18.810> like<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:19.140> look<00:00:19.410> so<00:00:19.860> I'll

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
cabinet I didn't like that look so I'll

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.500 
cabinet I didn't like that look so I'll
show<00:00:20.130> you<00:00:20.189> how<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:20.400> converted<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.240> full

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
show you how I converted it to a full

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.100 
show you how I converted it to a full
mortise<00:00:21.869> lock<00:00:21.900> set<00:00:22.910> first<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:24.180> remove<00:00:24.779> some<00:00:24.810> of

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.110 
mortise lock set first I remove some of

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.380 
mortise lock set first I remove some of
the<00:00:25.230> excess<00:00:25.650> material<00:00:25.829> on<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:27.000> plate<00:00:27.360> that

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
the excess material on that plate that

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.650 
the excess material on that plate that
would<00:00:27.779> normally<00:00:27.989> be<00:00:28.259> exposed<00:00:28.829> and<00:00:29.570> then<00:00:30.570> I

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
would normally be exposed and then I

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.950 
would normally be exposed and then I
drilled<00:00:30.930> two<00:00:31.169> countersunk<00:00:31.770> holes<00:00:31.919> in<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.790> top

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.560 

this<00:00:36.960> will<00:00:37.200> allow<00:00:37.440> us<00:00:37.470> to<00:00:37.680> fit<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.760> lock<00:00:39.239> set

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
this will allow us to fit a lock set

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.290 
this will allow us to fit a lock set
into<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.289> full<00:00:40.649> mortise<00:00:41.070> on<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.789> front<00:00:42.059> edge<00:00:42.210> of

into a full mortise on the front edge of

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.410 
into a full mortise on the front edge of
the<00:00:42.359> blanket<00:00:42.600> chest<00:00:43.730> I'll<00:00:44.730> do<00:00:44.969> this<00:00:45.149> on<00:00:45.329> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
the blanket chest I'll do this on the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.709 
the blanket chest I'll do this on the
router<00:00:45.600> table<00:00:46.460> with<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.489> half-inch<00:00:47.940> spiral<00:00:48.539> up

cut<00:00:49.050> bit<00:00:49.320> tucked<00:00:50.010> into<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.340> router<00:00:50.960> we'll

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
cut bit tucked into the router we'll

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.380 
cut bit tucked into the router we'll
move<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.379> box<00:00:52.589> back<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.339> forth<00:00:53.609> while

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
move the box back and forth while

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.270 
move the box back and forth while
bringing<00:00:54.839> the<00:00:54.929> router<00:00:55.109> bit<00:00:55.379> up<00:00:55.620> into<00:00:56.160> the

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
bringing the router bit up into the

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.639 
bringing the router bit up into the
workpiece<00:00:56.730> with<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.359> foot<00:00:57.570> pedal

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.400 

we<00:01:01.160> need<00:01:01.309> a<00:01:01.340> pretty<00:01:01.640> deep<00:01:01.879> mortise<00:01:02.360> almost<00:01:03.199> two

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
we need a pretty deep mortise almost two

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.130 
we need a pretty deep mortise almost two
inches<00:01:03.710> deep<00:01:03.949> so<00:01:04.390> this<00:01:05.390> is<00:01:05.540> a<00:01:05.570> pretty<00:01:05.810> stable

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
inches deep so this is a pretty stable

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.440 
inches deep so this is a pretty stable
way<00:01:06.409> to<00:01:06.470> do<00:01:06.710> it<00:01:06.860> I've<00:01:07.460> added<00:01:07.700> that<00:01:07.909> heavy<00:01:08.150> motor

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
way to do it I've added that heavy motor

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.840 
way to do it I've added that heavy motor
on<00:01:08.659> top<00:01:08.930> just<00:01:09.500> to<00:01:09.619> keep<00:01:09.799> the<00:01:09.920> Box<00:01:10.159> steady<00:01:10.610> on

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
on top just to keep the Box steady on

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.870 
on top just to keep the Box steady on
the<00:01:11.240> router<00:01:11.420> table<00:01:11.690> I<00:01:14.979> move<00:01:15.979> the<00:01:16.130> box<00:01:16.310> back<00:01:16.640> and

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
the router table I move the box back and

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.469 
the router table I move the box back and
forth<00:01:17.119> will<00:01:17.960> gradually<00:01:18.320> cut<00:01:18.649> the<00:01:18.770> mortise

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.820 

here<00:01:23.479> you<00:01:23.630> can<00:01:23.780> see<00:01:23.960> how<00:01:24.140> much<00:01:24.290> bit<00:01:24.560> we<00:01:24.710> have

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
here you can see how much bit we have

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.100 
here you can see how much bit we have
exposed<00:01:25.280> above<00:01:25.580> the<00:01:25.790> table<00:01:26.000> how<00:01:26.780> deep<00:01:27.080> that

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
exposed above the table how deep that

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.700 
exposed above the table how deep that
mortise<00:01:27.680> had<00:01:27.890> to<00:01:28.009> be<00:01:28.159> for<00:01:28.430> the<00:01:28.490> lock<00:01:28.670> set<00:01:32.649> now<00:01:33.649> I

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
mortise had to be for the lock set now I

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.919 
mortise had to be for the lock set now I
need<00:01:33.950> to<00:01:34.009> make<00:01:34.160> a<00:01:34.190> shell<00:01:34.490> reveal<00:01:35.060> in<00:01:35.300> the<00:01:35.690> top

the entire box with mineral spirits the

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.429 
the entire box with mineral spirits the
finish<00:04:41.879> we'll<00:04:42.030> be<00:04:42.150> using<00:04:42.330> is<00:04:42.659> a<00:04:42.870> three-step

00:04:43.429 --> 00:04:43.439 
finish we'll be using is a three-step

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:47.570 
finish we'll be using is a three-step
process<00:04:44.449> the<00:04:45.449> first<00:04:45.780> step<00:04:46.050> is<00:04:46.259> to<00:04:46.949> apply<00:04:47.069> an

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
process the first step is to apply an

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.719 
process the first step is to apply an
alcohol-based<00:04:48.240> dye<00:04:48.840> this<00:04:49.800> is<00:04:50.009> a<00:04:50.039> very<00:04:50.370> pale

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
alcohol-based dye this is a very pale

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.570 
alcohol-based dye this is a very pale
dye<00:04:51.120> and<00:04:51.509> it<00:04:51.840> just<00:04:52.080> sets<00:04:52.319> an<00:04:52.530> undertone<00:04:53.189> for

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
dye and it just sets an undertone for

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.529 
dye and it just sets an undertone for
the<00:04:53.669> finish<00:04:55.550> we<00:04:56.550> wipe<00:04:56.789> this<00:04:56.969> on<00:04:57.150> quickly

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
the finish we wipe this on quickly

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:00.170 
the finish we wipe this on quickly
because<00:04:58.259> the<00:04:58.409> alcohol-based<00:04:58.860> dye<00:04:59.400> dries

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
because the alcohol-based dye dries

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.010 
because the alcohol-based dye dries
quickly<00:05:01.490> the<00:05:02.490> second<00:05:02.909> step<00:05:03.120> is<00:05:03.509> to<00:05:03.689> apply<00:05:03.750> an

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
quickly the second step is to apply an

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.779 
quickly the second step is to apply an
oil-based<00:05:04.409> stain<00:05:06.979> we<00:05:07.979> work<00:05:08.250> this<00:05:08.430> into<00:05:08.669> the

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789 
oil-based stain we work this into the

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:10.939 
oil-based stain we work this into the
grain<00:05:09.029> and<00:05:09.300> then<00:05:09.840> wipe<00:05:10.110> off<00:05:10.289> the<00:05:10.529> excess

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:10.949 
grain and then wipe off the excess

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:19.969 
grain and then wipe off the excess
almost<00:05:11.430> immediately<00:05:18.379> here<00:05:19.379> you<00:05:19.469> can<00:05:19.650> see<00:05:19.830> the

alcohol-based dye going on the top it's

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:25.429 
alcohol-based dye going on the top it's
really<00:05:23.400> a<00:05:23.430> pale<00:05:23.729> yellow<00:05:24.000> but<00:05:24.810> it<00:05:24.930> sets<00:05:25.139> a<00:05:25.229> nice

00:05:25.429 --> 00:05:25.439 
really a pale yellow but it sets a nice

applying the finish I'd look into a

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:57.859 
applying the finish I'd look into a
light<00:05:56.249> that<00:05:56.580> helps<00:05:56.729> me<00:05:57.029> to<00:05:57.059> detect<00:05:57.569> any
