it so we're gonna try it first I'm just
gonna<00:01:59.820> moisten<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.450> down<00:02:00.780> into<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.140> cup

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
gonna moisten this down into a cup

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.940 
gonna moisten this down into a cup
because<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.799> didn't<00:02:02.040> really<00:02:02.250> want<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.490> hold<00:02:02.759> it

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.730 

I<00:02:06.689> think<00:02:07.689> you<00:02:07.900> know<00:02:07.990> I<00:02:08.020> never<00:02:08.170> annoy<00:02:08.500> some

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
I think you know I never annoy some

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.199 
I think you know I never annoy some
pre-moistened<00:02:09.220> mind<00:02:09.640> I<00:02:09.729> think<00:02:09.910> this<00:02:10.030> is<00:02:10.179> a

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
pre-moistened mind I think this is a

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:19.300 
pre-moistened mind I think this is a
good<00:02:10.330> idea

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.410 

bet<00:02:20.310> that's<00:02:20.490> gonna<00:02:20.640> be<00:02:20.790> hot<00:02:21.440> nope<00:02:23.240> so<00:02:24.240> that's

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
bet that's gonna be hot nope so that's

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.020 
bet that's gonna be hot nope so that's
all<00:02:24.600> wet<00:02:24.840> we<00:02:25.710> have<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:25.950> 23<00:02:26.400> grams<00:02:26.610> of<00:02:26.820> coffee

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.080 
we go now that's kind of like a bloom
although<00:02:58.410> I<00:02:58.440> wonder<00:02:58.860> because<00:02:58.890> I<00:02:59.550> don't<00:02:59.880> think

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
although I wonder because I don't think

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.700 
although I wonder because I don't think
the<00:03:00.180> coffee<00:03:00.390> down<00:03:00.660> below<00:03:01.020> is<00:03:01.260> totally

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
moistened but maybe that will work its

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.020 
moistened but maybe that will work its
way<00:03:03.510> through<00:03:04.340> I'm<00:03:05.340> not<00:03:05.490> gonna<00:03:05.640> mess<00:03:05.820> with<00:03:05.850> it

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
way through I'm not gonna mess with it

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:13.479 
way through I'm not gonna mess with it
too<00:03:06.150> much

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.750

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
like it it would be maybe a new way for

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:22.360 
like it it would be maybe a new way for
me<00:03:18.950> to<00:03:18.980> will<00:03:19.250> be<00:03:20.590> using<00:03:21.590> my<00:03:21.709> arrow<00:03:21.859> press<00:03:22.189> I'm

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
me to will be using my arrow press I'm

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.170 
me to will be using my arrow press I'm
not<00:03:22.519> sure<00:03:22.760> that<00:03:22.790> I<00:03:22.969> use<00:03:23.390> I<00:03:24.670> think<00:03:25.670> I<00:03:25.790> probably

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
not sure that I use I think I probably

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.410 
not sure that I use I think I probably
use<00:03:26.629> more<00:03:27.109> than<00:03:27.319> the<00:03:27.530> 23<00:03:28.189> grams<00:03:28.489> would<00:03:29.000> be<00:03:29.239> my

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
use more than the 23 grams would be my

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.970 
use more than the 23 grams would be my
guess<00:03:29.750> I've<00:03:29.959> never<00:03:30.139> really<00:03:30.469> measured<00:03:30.650> it<00:03:30.859> out

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
guess I've never really measured it out

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:42.760 
guess I've never really measured it out
I<00:03:31.010> just<00:03:31.310> used<00:03:31.489> the<00:03:31.670> scoop<00:03:35.049> fill<00:03:36.049> it<00:03:36.170> up

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
stout than when I typically make in the

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.870 
stout than when I typically make in the
Aeropress<00:05:01.770> like<00:05:02.039> I<00:05:02.130> always<00:05:02.280> think<00:05:02.610> to<00:05:02.699> myself

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
Aeropress like I always think to myself

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.939 
Aeropress like I always think to myself
why<00:05:03.180> do<00:05:03.240> I<00:05:03.360> make<00:05:03.509> it<00:05:03.570> so<00:05:03.780> stout<00:05:04.020> I<00:05:04.080> would<00:05:04.620> prefer
