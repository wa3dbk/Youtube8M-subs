00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:08.090
 hello today we are going to make a ceviche of 

00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:09.080
 fish is a typical Peruvian dish that 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.550
 we are going to do our way 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.680
 so I 'm sure that you too 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.070
 you have a way of doing it 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.230
 let's use a perch fillet 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.090
 share of limes a green pepper a 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.700
 little garlic salt cilantro pepper and 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.439
 purple onion let's start what 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.950
 first thing we're going to do is unlink the 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.950
 fish 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.530
 and once we have it, we reserve it 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.449
 let's wait for it with the game of 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.109
 lima so what are we going to do is start 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:46.109
 to squeeze the 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.780
 one of the first three we are going to water 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.940
 the fish with them 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.770
 one we already have all the liquid thrown 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.770
 like salt to season a little bit 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.080
 we are going to use salt in flakes 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.220
 salt maldon but you can use 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.220
 any other type of salt 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.409
 we are also going to put a little bit of 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.409
 cilantro so let's chop 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.080
 let's put a little bit of onion 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.310
 that we have chosen this abode so that 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.310
 Give a little bit of color and contrast 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.420
 let's put a little pepper 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.870
 we have taken this which is 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.460
 similar to habanero but in green 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.840
 let's make a very small cut 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.060
 because what we want is for him to release 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.820
 much the itching and when we eat it 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.890
 give us a surprise 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.020
 and finally we are going to add a little 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.820
 of garlic one that we have all the 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.979
 ingredients now let's do is 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.300
 remove it well to frame it later in 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.610
 the refrigerator for half an hour 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.369
 approximately what we are going to do is 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.350
 that all the ingredients in paper of 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.510
 the lime and it also makes me in the 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.360
 fish is to say more than a small 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.710
 cooking with citrus and we will be able to 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.690
 eat directly 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.970
 and in this simple way we have 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.930
 prepared this typical Peruvian dish if 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.190
