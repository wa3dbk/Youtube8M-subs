bit better but this point here is ground

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.490 
bit better but this point here is ground
and<00:01:28.770> then<00:01:29.040> this<00:01:29.670> point<00:01:30.060> here<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.600> positive<00:01:31.290> you

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
and then this point here is positive you

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.310 
and then this point here is positive you
never<00:01:31.860> want<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.280> install<00:01:32.729> on<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.299> led<00:01:33.780> you

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
watt and go to the ground point heat up

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.850 
watt and go to the ground point heat up
the<00:01:57.930> ground<00:01:58.170> point<00:01:58.500> and<00:02:00.290> solder<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.530> point

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
the ground point and solder the point

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.690 
the ground point and solder the point
into<00:02:02.460> place<00:02:02.700> if<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.299> can<00:02:03.450> get<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.750> work<00:02:04.700> okay

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
into place if I can get it to work okay

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.290 
into place if I can get it to work okay
so<00:02:05.759> now<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.210> have<00:02:06.479> your<00:02:06.630> ground<00:02:06.899> point<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.350> on

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
so now you have your ground point is on

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.119 
so now you have your ground point is on
now<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.360> go<00:02:09.599> over<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:09.959> your<00:02:10.289> other<00:02:10.470> side<00:02:10.800> what

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
now you go over to your other side what

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.970 
now you go over to your other side what
I<00:02:11.160> like<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.610> do<00:02:11.819> is<00:02:12.270> I<00:02:12.599> will<00:02:12.989> take<00:02:13.230> it

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
I like to do is I will take it

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.760 
I like to do is I will take it
and<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:14.670> will<00:02:14.819> cut<00:02:15.060> down<00:02:15.230> because<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.440> doesn't

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
and I will cut down because it doesn't

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.610 
and I will cut down because it doesn't
need<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:16.950> be<00:02:17.099> really<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:17.610> long<00:02:18.349> and<00:02:19.349> go<00:02:19.560> to

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
need to be really that long and go to

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.640 
need to be really that long and go to
the<00:02:20.280> power<00:02:20.519> the<00:02:20.849> power<00:02:21.090> point<00:02:21.629> positive<00:02:22.410> side

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
the power the power point positive side

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.880 
the power the power point positive side
heat<00:02:23.640> up<00:02:23.819> the<00:02:23.970> solder<00:02:24.180> point<00:02:24.629> stick<00:02:25.349> it<00:02:25.470> on<00:02:25.620> and

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
heat up the solder point stick it on and

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.360 
heat up the solder point stick it on and
you<00:02:26.400> are<00:02:26.670> finished<00:02:27.030> now<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:28.050> know<00:02:28.349> that<00:02:28.800> most<00:02:28.980> it

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
you are finished now I know that most it

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.059 
you are finished now I know that most it
looks<00:02:29.700> pretty<00:02:30.090> simple<00:02:30.390> but<00:02:31.349> I<00:02:31.380> have<00:02:31.620> also<00:02:31.800> been

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
looks pretty simple but I have also been

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.699 
looks pretty simple but I have also been
doing<00:02:32.220> this<00:02:32.459> for<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.730> couple<00:02:33.090> of<00:02:33.150> years<00:02:33.660> so<00:02:34.110> it

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
doing this for a couple of years so it

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.920 
doing this for a couple of years so it
really<00:02:34.980> isn't<00:02:35.220> that<00:02:35.430> much<00:02:35.519> I'm<00:02:36.150> going<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.569> redo

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
really isn't that much I'm going to redo

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:45.440 
really isn't that much I'm going to redo
that<00:02:37.110> point<00:02:42.290> okay<00:02:43.519> so<00:02:44.519> now<00:02:44.640> that<00:02:44.670> point<00:02:45.120> is<00:02:45.209> on

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
that point okay so now that point is on

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.780 
that point okay so now that point is on
what<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:45.959> want<00:02:46.140> to<00:02:46.230> do<00:02:46.380> is<00:02:46.739> either<00:02:47.160> you<00:02:47.430> can<00:02:47.610> do

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
what you want to do is either you can do

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.729 
what you want to do is either you can do
the<00:02:48.120> front<00:02:50.060> take<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.209> front<00:02:51.480> point<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:51.959> you

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
the front take the front point and you

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.729 
the front take the front point and you
can<00:02:52.950> take<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.519> board<00:02:53.760> out<00:02:54.349> now<00:02:55.349> you<00:02:55.410> can

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
can take the board out now you can

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.120 
can take the board out now you can
replace<00:02:55.890> your<00:02:56.099> thumb<00:02:56.459> sticks<00:02:56.849> on<00:02:57.810> to<00:02:58.709> the

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
replace your thumb sticks on to the

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:15.540 
replace your thumb sticks on to the
board

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.949 

okay<00:03:16.550> so<00:03:16.880> now<00:03:17.000> that<00:03:17.030> we<00:03:17.270> have<00:03:17.420> that<00:03:17.569> on<00:03:17.720> there

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
okay so now that we have that on there

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.229 
okay so now that we have that on there
you<00:03:18.530> can<00:03:18.709> stick<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:19.250> controller<00:03:19.640> board<00:03:19.940> back

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
you can stick the controller board back

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.610 
you can stick the controller board back
in<00:03:20.569> and<00:03:21.160> what<00:03:22.160> I<00:03:22.190> normally<00:03:22.310> do<00:03:22.970> is<00:03:23.000> I<00:03:23.620> normally

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
in and what I normally do is I normally

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.680 
in and what I normally do is I normally
leave<00:03:24.830> all<00:03:25.099> my<00:03:25.250> Rumble<00:03:25.580> motors<00:03:25.849> out<00:03:26.000> because

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
leave all my Rumble motors out because

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.780 
leave all my Rumble motors out because
it's<00:03:27.020> just<00:03:27.260> I<00:03:27.500> have<00:03:27.709> no<00:03:27.920> real<00:03:28.160> use<00:03:28.430> for<00:03:28.459> them

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
it's just I have no real use for them

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.330 
it's just I have no real use for them
actually<00:03:29.270> I<00:03:29.300> did<00:03:29.630> that<00:03:29.750> wrong<00:03:33.069> what<00:03:34.069> you<00:03:34.190> need

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
actually I did that wrong what you need

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.790 
actually I did that wrong what you need
to<00:03:34.430> do<00:03:34.610> is<00:03:35.000> install<00:03:35.630> the<00:03:35.690> mic<00:03:36.050> insert<00:03:36.440> first

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
to do is install the mic insert first

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.290 
to do is install the mic insert first
make<00:03:39.800> sure<00:03:39.830> wires<00:03:40.280> are<00:03:40.670> not<00:03:40.700> going<00:03:41.090> to<00:03:41.180> be

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
make sure wires are not going to be

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.390 
make sure wires are not going to be
pinching<00:03:41.540> in<00:03:41.870> everyway<00:03:42.319> anyway<00:03:44.980> and<00:03:45.980> it<00:03:46.190> goes

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
pinching in everyway anyway and it goes

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.050 
pinching in everyway anyway and it goes
I<00:03:50.739> just<00:03:51.739> leave<00:03:51.860> the<00:03:51.980> Robo<00:03:52.220> voters<00:03:52.489> out<00:03:52.700> because

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
I just leave the Robo voters out because

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.750 
I just leave the Robo voters out because
it<00:03:53.239> is<00:03:53.269> simpler<00:03:53.840> to<00:03:53.870> do<00:03:54.280> it<00:03:55.280> doesn't<00:03:55.459> cause<00:03:55.730> any

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
it is simpler to do it doesn't cause any

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.430 
it is simpler to do it doesn't cause any
pinching<00:03:56.450> or<00:03:56.600> anything<00:03:56.780> else<00:03:57.049> like<00:03:57.200> that

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
pinching or anything else like that

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.680 
pinching or anything else like that
and<00:03:58.040> then<00:03:58.430> at<00:03:58.730> this<00:03:58.850> point<00:03:59.120> you<00:03:59.239> would<00:03:59.450> screw

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
and then at this point you would screw

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.390 
and then at this point you would screw
your<00:03:59.840> controller<00:04:00.170> back<00:04:00.440> together<00:04:00.620> but<00:04:01.130> I'm

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
your controller back together but I'm

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.240 
your controller back together but I'm
not<00:04:01.580> going<00:04:01.940> to<00:04:02.090> because<00:04:02.690> I<00:04:03.110> this<00:04:03.739> is<00:04:03.890> only<00:04:04.100> a

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
not going to because I this is only a

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.470 
not going to because I this is only a
demonstration
