00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:07.790
 Over Te's a Hi everyone important 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:13.099
 That's a bit unusual price today in the questions asked 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:14.880
 There was is that improvement point of time of the fledgling It is in that asked questions 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:18.180
 so 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.590
 Well when and when 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.590
 Apart from the image 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:31.030
 I would like to tell you a little bit about what I was thinking at the beginning of the finger 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.480
 We adopt for feedback sheet in my school, but with spot mirror 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.850
 Say 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:38.379
 Researcher 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.550
 The three points that are related to whether or not the session is effective 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:43.690
 there is 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:47.440
 Well, one of those things was that the client got close to me after the session was over 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:52.899
 I think that the crown seller clambered cat and 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:57.730
 You know counselor that I think it was enough speak you want to talk about the second related client funds 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:59.920
 Seems the coach speak what you want to talk about is not not you think that is doing to speak opponent 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.980
 And the third one 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.650
 way of deployment of a how to proceed no session 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.540
 What 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:14.930
 In addition, including what kind of hard homework you will get out now 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:16.190
 Thing is not to say the Fu that these three scales are high when the result comes out to say 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.510
 so 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:23.750
 If you do So I gave snuggled up I tried to think in various ways and for that matter 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:30.230
 I wonder if you could think that you were close to me 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:35.750
 Go with a smile that the Tteyuu notes to any wind in, for example, Hey smile Toka seriousness 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:36.180
 Naa so I see with N office ah or to any wind in any or wind to go listen seriously 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.730
 Ne 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:45.560
 I wonder if us thought that the other party was me more snuggled I went to like? 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:51.320
 Here is in what kind of wind I use the emotion in to any wind 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:55.920
 Of the order to have thought me snuggled is seriously and have Once in like trying to Uketomeyo after I 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:59.880
 It's about thinking about how to handle the relationship yourself 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.630
 What I want to talk about is what the nature is and what is the starting point 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.890
 fluent 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:08.190
 That's good , but if there is enough to listen to it, is it all right ? 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.640
 Sometimes the client does not tell me anything that I really want to talk about 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.980
 I will 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:15.540
 Care while spear of what I wanted to do really go by a little heard was disgusting Gatsui 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.910
 It will be 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.960
 About 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:24.250
 Toka Toka be really nasty things that really wants what and how 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.570
 Oh really at the time it was started talking about something not made me this is wanted to say 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.760
 It is 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:33.810
 So if I could tell him what I wanted to do 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:37.030
 It's such that Rutte thinking this I wonder if I become a client look and their own 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.620
 It is to check the relationship one by one 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.459
 A sense of satisfaction in the process 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.659
 Selfish say it will do get to have a sense of comfort in how to proceed Once you do but it is difficult 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.890
 So 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:55.190
 The principle principle is to hear the other person's first story firmly after all 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:56.810
 The truth that really wanted Dale to continue to deep listening in going into that nasty 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.610
 At any timing 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:04.800
 For example, tell me a little more 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:08.820
 There is something I want to try for a while 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.710
 For example, it means that you will be involved in the work The timeline due to the position change 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.090
 To verify the site 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.090
 In went involving in there 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:22.140
 A really whether Asso if such a thing is it sputum happening Asso of Tteyuu I was hoping this 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.640
 How can we make it that process the process everyone gets on 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:28.740
 And I think 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:31.470
 A word of the bridge What if I just connect to the work from where I just listen to the other's story 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:34.210
 Does the person have a sense of consent 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.270
 Verification to think my own the way that say 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:42.580
 It means that we will always do what we do 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:43.240
 After all, it is not sold to the research to a certain extent and it is cut off + and so on 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.500
 What 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:51.970
 Guidelines that are adopted by many people If it goes like this , intake goes well 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.490
 How do you technically practice that this is not important or not 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:58.680
 Do you go 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:04:03.270
 For it is that speak what you want to talk No. 2 what it is that you can for the best snuggled up to me 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:09.810
 It's not just light weight but what you can do after that 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:13.480
 In order to get people Toka become the No. 3 how to proceed is what much after all is in confidence 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:17.320
 How well to make a talk and listen just how expressively rear 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:21.880
 Want it to talk to I'll go do and let the Above all Uchotto action 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:24.280
 I want to talk about things that I can talk to and that I try to hear what it means 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.699
 I can talk to you and approach and from there 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:32.410
 Well I want you to tell me a little more, but I want to try a little 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:33.580
 That it's such that to proceed with the proposal that there is persuasive I'm there it 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.970
 The 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:39.340
 It ends try to actually meet with the image that says Do I think we can be like this 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:43.900
 If you check from the beginning try this out yourself 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.830
 In the end what happens after the session is over One is emotionally refreshing 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.120
 It is 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:51.460
 And the second thing is that you are aware of something as a hint to change your life and change 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.600
 It means that the Western-style building has appeared 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:57.350
 So what to do to get noticed 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:01.070
 It is difficult if you have to learn sharp questions 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:06.350
 Should I have to be able to create such a thing ? 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:11.870
 In the end, I arrived at the point is to do thorough site verification 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:13.590
 What is going on in the inside what was happening in the outside what was happening in the Kakoi Hachimei scene 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:18.480
 I will explore it 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:20.889
 Remember that once again, I will try to immerse in the scene 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.289
 And emotional thinking at that time 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:27.639
 Do not try to experience again one more time 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:29.139
 Really through this kind of thing this was weird Really it was like this Really 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:33.520
 I wanted this way 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:38.919
 It means that you will think about what you can do while looking at it 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:39.999
 In the end, I would like to do it, so how are we going there? 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:42.760
 Do you think 

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:48.490
 Well, it means that we will calculate back from there 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:52.510
 Have the other party hold a solid sense of trust in order to make a butt to make it cleaner 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:56.830
 First of all, let's listen to the story and stay for a little more. 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:06:00.880
 I would like to ask for a little while but there is something I would like to try for a while but I have one more 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:02.750
 At that time I want you to remember the real I try to make a scene where there was here 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:08.990
 Now recall the once little the scene 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:10.729
 If you make an awareness while looking at the inside firmly with re-experience and taste here 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.500
 It means 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:16.490
 To 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:18.969
 Professional that quest c along with the time to be with each other to support the opponent 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:23.049
 If you take a position 

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:24.579
 I wonder if these three scales will eventually be fulfilled 

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:28.689
 It is that such a thing to say 

00:06:24.579 --> 00:06:32.860
 I wonder if what can Once while earnestly consider the three of wear and good results 

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:38.960
 I think that you have been thinking of going out and you are making your own coaching 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:43.069
 I think this is also an old time I thought, so by all means I think this is correct 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:44.480
 Think full and make your own theory 

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:48.830
 that 

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:50.770
 Milton Erickson not not you also learn you by someone of the technique say make my own contribution 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:55.590
 It is to say may leave 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:55.590
 I will tell you about the information so I thought
