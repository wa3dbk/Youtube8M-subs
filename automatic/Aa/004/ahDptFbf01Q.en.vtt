00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.420
 will explain why 300 more than one 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.469
 maximum and looking for anything 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.120
 which country any championship 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.000
 any club 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.920
 this team will serve you 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.420
 make money on single games 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.699
 either for online on your computer 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.680
 and you will lose at any time from 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.100
 money on them understand you 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.670
 do the search look only 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:13.110
 the players who have this contract or 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:16.020
 more and you'll put up to 300 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.060
 on the map for example like this one 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.520
 you put 300 you will have your hurry 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.130
 you took only 300 players to go 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.030
 give you tell me what it's used for 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.500
 Once you have your team 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:31.710
 complete at 300 I created a team in 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:36.860
 live to show you what you want 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.860
 to team 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:50.540
 the center of the hockey teams mode test 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:52.190
 tancred team for the seleccion when 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.580
 you choose the training you want 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:58.400
 so we started there 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:01.970
 the explanation in 4-3-1-2 you 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.550
 save so you're actually going 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.160
 fill each position with players 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.670
 that you will pay the maximum on Thursday at 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:13.280
 maximum 300 credit so you go 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.080
 look for two scorers an atheist the 3rd 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.290
 it's the left defender the defender 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.240
 right the central defender the goalkeeper 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.100
 you have possibility if you want 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.780
 careful to look for a championship in 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.830
 particular to have the same a little 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.720
 little to grow in agreement with the 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.340
 other than they can like this is going to do 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.530
 a good pass by two calls etc 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.580
 I insist on the price of 300 because 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.190
 that you will see that this is what 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.270
 will never allow you but I say 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.310
 never lose money 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.200
 in fact if you notice if you too 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.709
 you know it or if you do not know 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.590
 a classic card we will take 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:51.739
 the example with him live a map 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.320
 classic of our 75 she resells herself 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:57.080
 immediately to the computer you know 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.480
 when you make the quick sale to 300 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.680
 so that is the map you 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.480
 bought it 300 l a7 will crunch you 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.000
 will be able to do after your matches 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.940
 do you remember you actually have 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.320
 will have players you make matches 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.690
 with the eleven players 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.640
 after a while at the end of the seven 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.080
 matches so all players will have no 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.180
 more contract why instead of 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.590
 spend money buying back 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.550
 contracts the cards you to resell them 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.900
 directly their computers 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.790
 if you have to know is that like you 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.560
 bought them 300 and wanted 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.050
 resell and automatically 300 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.459
 the computer you lost no 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.620
 credit but in the meantime you did 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.380
 of seven games you go this time the 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.160
 credits on players and you want 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.900
 resold at the price where you have them 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.280
 bought so it does not buy you 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.230
 contracts and in the end you won 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.480
 many men a lot more money 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.500
 than with your normal team because 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.200
 that every time we go to 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.530
 contracts they are tired and so that's 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.780
 to you do the seven matches 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.980
 as soon as they are all out of contract at 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.470
 lille wendel automatically 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.970
 the computer here look at the age is there 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.400
 I have the map that it works and so 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.880
 I got him 300 in the team 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.920
 active 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.420
 here I am not going to do it with 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.920
 the huge map pass eyes it takes when 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.200
 even a little bit of time to see the 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.700
 wii players put a coach 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.130
 always in the same principle 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.600
 against the coach if you 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.640
 put him you can not resell it 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.190
 you bought it an uncle is not 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.380
 obliged to do it imagine that's the 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.290
 caretaker no longer has a contract so we 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:25.680
 happens there you do quick sale and 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:27.540
 look at it resells 300c to you go 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.660
 do seven games dare to deliver no 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.070
 credit and you'll admit it resold at 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.870
 price you bought it here 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.580
 so that's what we might call 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.500
 a team only to make 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.930
 credits must make games offline 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.400
 or salty cut that we have against 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.060
 the computer one earns credits from 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.740
 bonus etc 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:48.660
 the family lawsuit like that in gold or 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.130
 for example first league where you know 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.229
 nothing and it's you choose your 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.000
 training you buy all the players 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:56.120
 at 300 and as soon as they take to you 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.650
 sell everything here it is a little info 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.930
 it's a quick way to do 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:05.220
 money so you still need to 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:07.650
 minimum 3300 credit to create the team 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.630
 since you will need a day at 300 and 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.780
 I insist on the fact do not take 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:16.620
 players who have only 7 or more in contract 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.910
 six years - it will be finally - o 0 it's 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.640
 interesting since you bought the 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.320
 card to add them to contract here is 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:26.039
 I hope this little video you 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.210
 serve to I will also talk about them a 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:30.720
 video that I'm going to do right after 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.700
 this one if I have the time that is a 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.919
 little contest on the chain there will be 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.530
 credits to win so here's stay 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:39.510
 all this shows to listen I'm doing that
