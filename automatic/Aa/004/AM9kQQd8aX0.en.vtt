00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.250
 and 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.800
 We preheat the oven to 200 degrees 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.890
 while we spread the dough on a 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.140
 smooth surface sprinkle sugar for 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.960
 all the dough and we passed a rolling pin 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.470
 gently enough so that it 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.020
 embed the sugar in the dough 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.180
 then we bend the tips towards 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.660
 the center we return to export boreal 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:45.250
 sugar and roll the roller repeat the 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.710
 previous process once again 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.440
 finally we mount a part on top of 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.370
 the other sprinkle sugar again and 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.370
 we passed the roller 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.440
 we turn it over and repeat the 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.440
 process 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.589
 Now we cut the dough into pieces of a 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.020
 finger thickness approximately 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.060
 then we put the pieces on a piece of paper 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.409
 of oven well separated and crushed 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.079
 slightly with the help of a knife 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.119
 big and we go back to sprinkle sugar 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:17.700
 now we will have the shape of the 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.069
 palmeritas we pass them to a tire and 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.830
 we put them in the oven for 10 

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:25.920
 minutes or until they start to brown 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.930
 After that time we turn them over and 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.910
 we bake them between 3 and 5 minutes more 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.350
 when they are ready, we remove them from 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.300
 oven 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.320
 finally let them cool in a 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.510
 grating 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.820
 we can also melt a bit of 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:46.040
 chocolate to melt and cover some 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.040
 palmeritas to give a different touch 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.380
 and remember invite some friends and 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.380
 enjoy this delicious dish 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.409
 to me 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.409
