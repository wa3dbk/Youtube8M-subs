pink<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.210> lavender<00:01:48.659> spots<00:01:49.320> it's<00:01:49.860> very<00:01:50.100> hard

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
pink and lavender spots it's very hard

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.639 
pink and lavender spots it's very hard
to<00:01:50.520> see<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.850> lavender<00:01:51.030> on<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.869> film<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.320> looks

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
to see the lavender on the film it looks

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.560 
to see the lavender on the film it looks
pink<00:01:53.009> but<00:01:53.310> it's<00:01:53.460> actually<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:53.939> very<00:01:54.180> light

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
pink but it's actually a very light

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.340

really beautiful pastel lavender now on

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.190 
really beautiful pastel lavender now on
my<00:01:58.530> ring<00:01:58.770> finger<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:59.189> decided<00:01:59.700> I<00:02:00.000> wanted<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.719> do

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
my ring finger I decided I wanted to do

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.289 
my ring finger I decided I wanted to do
like<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.649> gradient<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.700> pink<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.180> the

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
like a gradient of the pink and the

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.289 
like a gradient of the pink and the
purple<00:02:03.590> I<00:02:04.590> started<00:02:05.369> off<00:02:05.490> just<00:02:05.520> doing<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.090> tip

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
purple I started off just doing the tip

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.270 
purple I started off just doing the tip
with<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.630> pink<00:02:06.869> but<00:02:07.079> decided<00:02:07.590> wasn't<00:02:07.950> working

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
with the pink but decided wasn't working

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.540 
with the pink but decided wasn't working
very<00:02:08.310> well<00:02:08.670> so<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.179> came<00:02:09.780> back<00:02:09.989> in<00:02:10.319> with<00:02:10.979> on<00:02:11.280> my

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
very well so I came back in with on my

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.309 
very well so I came back in with on my
sponge<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:12.180> black<00:02:12.390> then<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.720> pink<00:02:12.989> been<00:02:13.230> the

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
sponge the black then the pink been the

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.760 
sponge the black then the pink been the
purple

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
purple

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.190 
purple
so<00:02:14.040> if<00:02:14.880> you<00:02:15.060> do<00:02:15.240> that<00:02:15.450> then<00:02:15.660> you<00:02:15.780> get<00:02:15.960> a<00:02:15.990> much

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
so if you do that then you get a much

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.340 
so if you do that then you get a much
bit<00:02:16.500> much<00:02:16.740> more<00:02:17.310> very<00:02:17.880> much<00:02:18.030> sorry<00:02:18.870> having

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
bit much more very much sorry having

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.380 
bit much more very much sorry having
trouble<00:02:19.590> with<00:02:19.650> my<00:02:19.830> words<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.280> much<00:02:20.730> smoother

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
trouble with my words and much smoother

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:31.690 
trouble with my words and much smoother
gradient

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.130 

now<00:02:32.700> as<00:02:32.879> you<00:02:33.060> can<00:02:33.150> see<00:02:33.209> I<00:02:33.360> didn't<00:02:33.780> use<00:02:33.930> any

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
now as you can see I didn't use any

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.899 
now as you can see I didn't use any
liquid<00:02:34.349> latex<00:02:34.860> with<00:02:35.220> this<00:02:35.340> because<00:02:35.549> I<00:02:35.760> knew

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
liquid latex with this because I knew

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:37.369 
liquid latex with this because I knew
the<00:02:36.060> cleaner<00:02:36.360> wasn't<00:02:36.659> going<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:37.019> be<00:02:37.110> that

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
the cleaner wasn't going to be that

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.559 
the cleaner wasn't going to be that
great<00:02:37.560> because<00:02:38.010> I<00:02:38.099> wasn't<00:02:38.310> doing<00:02:38.610> a<00:02:38.700> complete

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
great because I wasn't doing a complete

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.500 
great because I wasn't doing a complete
gradient<00:02:40.530> on<00:02:40.799> my<00:02:41.069> nail<00:02:41.250> so<00:02:41.459> that's<00:02:42.269> why<00:02:42.480> I

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
gradient on my nail so that's why I

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.569 
gradient on my nail so that's why I
didn't<00:02:42.840> use<00:02:42.989> that<00:02:43.019> bit<00:02:43.470> that<00:02:44.069> I<00:02:44.099> don't<00:02:44.430> mind

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
didn't use that bit that I don't mind

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.410 
didn't use that bit that I don't mind
doing<00:02:44.730> cleanup<00:02:45.209> it<00:02:45.360> doesn't<00:02:45.629> really<00:02:45.750> worry<00:02:45.989> me

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
doing cleanup it doesn't really worry me

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.210
