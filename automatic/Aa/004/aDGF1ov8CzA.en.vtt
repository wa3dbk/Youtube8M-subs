well<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.510> was<00:01:03.690> hoping<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:04.229> get<00:01:04.610> some<00:01:05.780> footage<00:01:06.780> of

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
well I was hoping to get some footage of

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.310 
well I was hoping to get some footage of
the<00:01:07.950> birds<00:01:08.220> with<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.850> sound<00:01:09.390> from<00:01:09.810> my<00:01:09.990> remote

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
the birds with the sound from my remote

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.469 
the birds with the sound from my remote
microphone<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.250> hoped<00:01:11.760> you'd<00:01:11.909> uploaded<00:01:12.360> the

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
microphone I hoped you'd uploaded the

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.039 
microphone I hoped you'd uploaded the
bird<00:01:12.689> feeder<00:01:13.020> but<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:14.030> guess<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.299> weather<00:01:15.750> is

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
bird feeder but I guess the weather is

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.200 
bird feeder but I guess the weather is
far<00:01:16.320> too<00:01:16.530> cold<00:01:16.770> for<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.280> little<00:01:17.490> triple<00:01:18.090> a

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
far too cold for the little triple a

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.240 
far too cold for the little triple a
battery<00:01:18.689> that's<00:01:18.990> in<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.530> didn't<00:01:19.799> last<00:01:20.040> very

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
battery that's in it it didn't last very

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.630 
battery that's in it it didn't last very
long<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.000> battery<00:01:21.330> went<00:01:21.630> dead<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:22.640> silent

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
long and the battery went dead so silent

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.179 
long and the battery went dead so silent

temperature<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:02.969> 5<00:02:03.270> degrees<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:04.320> just<00:02:04.829> checked

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
temperature of 5 degrees I just checked

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.380 
temperature of 5 degrees I just checked
that<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:05.610> as<00:02:05.790> low<00:02:06.060> as<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.270> went<00:02:06.600> last<00:02:07.170> night<00:02:08.390> it

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
that is as low as it went last night it

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.990 
that is as low as it went last night it
was<00:02:09.539> minus<00:02:09.929> 16<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.830> according<00:02:11.700> if<00:02:11.819> those

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
was minus 16 and according if those

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.790 
was minus 16 and according if those
sensors<00:02:12.510> are<00:02:12.720> telling<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.110> truth

sensors are telling the truth
it<00:02:14.760> stayed<00:02:15.090> plus<00:02:15.930> five<00:02:16.260> degrees<00:02:16.910> under<00:02:17.910> the

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
it stayed plus five degrees under the

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.590 
it stayed plus five degrees under the
covers<00:02:18.390> with<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:19.490> the<00:02:20.490> fig<00:02:21.090> tree<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.540> the

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
heat tape I on the coldest day that

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.440 
heat tape I on the coldest day that
we've<00:02:24.870> had<00:02:25.110> so<00:02:25.350> far<00:02:25.380> it<00:02:25.830> was<00:02:26.010> minus<00:02:26.490> 18<00:02:27.030> and

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
we've had so far it was minus 18 and

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.420 
we've had so far it was minus 18 and
according<00:02:27.960> to<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.200> sensor<00:02:28.620> it<00:02:28.830> still<00:02:29.160> didn't

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
according to the sensor it still didn't

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.250 
according to the sensor it still didn't
go<00:02:29.580> below<00:02:29.850> freezing<00:02:30.270> it<00:02:30.660> went<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:30.990> three

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
go below freezing it went to three

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.910 
go below freezing it went to three
degrees<00:02:31.410> so<00:02:32.150> if<00:02:33.150> that<00:02:33.360> sensor<00:02:33.900> is<00:02:33.930> accurate<00:02:34.620> if

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
degrees so if that sensor is accurate if

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.970 
degrees so if that sensor is accurate if
this<00:02:35.100> is<00:02:35.250> doing<00:02:35.930> what<00:02:36.930> I<00:02:36.960> want<00:02:37.290> it<00:02:37.380> to<00:02:37.440> do

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
this is doing what I want it to do

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.070 
this is doing what I want it to do
time<00:02:38.280> will<00:02:38.490> tell<00:02:38.670> I<00:02:38.730> guess<00:02:38.880> comes<00:02:39.390> spring<00:02:39.840> this

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
time will tell I guess comes spring this

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.160 
time will tell I guess comes spring this
June<00:02:40.320> whether<00:02:41.250> or<00:02:41.460> not<00:02:41.580> it<00:02:41.820> actually<00:02:41.970> is<00:02:42.720> doing

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
June whether or not it actually is doing

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.210 
June whether or not it actually is doing
that<00:02:43.380> but<00:02:43.770> it<00:02:44.400> looks<00:02:44.640> promising<00:02:44.880> anyway<00:02:46.220> well

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
that but it looks promising anyway well
