tour<00:00:46.500> it's<00:00:47.250> called<00:00:47.579> surface<00:00:47.969> computing<00:00:48.780> and

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
tour it's called surface computing and

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.900 
tour it's called surface computing and
you<00:00:49.020> can<00:00:49.200> do<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.530> without<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:50.100> interface<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.820> a

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
you can do it without the interface of a

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.950 
you can do it without the interface of a
mouse<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.629> object<00:00:51.989> recognition<00:00:53.960> how

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
mouse so the object recognition how

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
restaurant yeah and then I can just take

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.200 
restaurant yeah and then I can just take
stuff<00:01:01.379> here<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.739> can<00:01:01.890> drag<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:03.059> when

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
stuff here and I can drag it in and when

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.210 
stuff here and I can drag it in and when
it<00:01:03.300> comes<00:01:03.449> time<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.809> pay<00:01:04.260> just<00:01:04.559> lay<00:01:04.830> down<00:01:05.040> your

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
it comes time to pay just lay down your

credit card divvy up the bill add in the
tip<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.950> leave<00:01:08.869> under<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.990> screen<00:01:10.320> are

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
tip and leave under the screen are

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.230 
tip and leave under the screen are
cameras<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.100> can<00:01:11.369> actually<00:01:11.729> see<00:01:12.030> what

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
cameras that can actually see what

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.550 
cameras that can actually see what
you're<00:01:12.390> touching<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:12.990> then<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.170> computer

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
you're touching and then the computer

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.060 
you're touching and then the computer
reacts<00:01:14.040> creating<00:01:14.729> an<00:01:14.820> image<00:01:15.200> there<00:01:16.200> we<00:01:16.320> go<00:01:16.470> and

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
reacts creating an image there we go and

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.100 
reacts creating an image there we go and
again<00:01:17.189> we<00:01:17.790> just<00:01:17.820> put<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.119> down<00:01:18.240> here<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.570> it

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
again we just put it down here and it

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.469 
again we just put it down here and it
spills<00:01:19.320> out<00:01:19.470> photos<00:01:20.009> not<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.460> prompt<00:01:20.850> see<00:01:21.119> it's

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
spills out photos not a prompt see it's

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.210 
spills out photos not a prompt see it's
like<00:01:21.720> you're<00:01:21.900> magically<00:01:22.470> drawn<00:01:22.740> out<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:23.100> your

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
like you're magically drawn out of your

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.030 
like you're magically drawn out of your
digital<00:01:23.640> camera<00:01:24.150> into<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.509> box<00:01:25.040> wirelessly

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
digital camera into the box wirelessly

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.190 
digital camera into the box wirelessly
of<00:01:26.250> course<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:26.850> now<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.090> can<00:01:27.299> grab<00:01:27.420> photos<00:01:27.840> and

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
of course so now you can grab photos and

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.469 
of course so now you can grab photos and
I<00:01:28.320> grab<00:01:28.560> photos<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.070> we<00:01:29.159> can<00:01:29.340> make<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.119> bigger

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
I grab photos and we can make it bigger

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.780 
I grab photos and we can make it bigger
so<00:01:30.630> it's<00:01:31.170> all<00:01:31.320> over<00:01:31.560> my<00:01:31.710> table<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.369> this<00:01:32.490> case

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
so it's all over my table in this case

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.789 
so it's all over my table in this case
in<00:01:33.240> this<00:01:33.420> case<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.259> so<00:01:34.380> we've<00:01:34.560> used

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
in this case it is and so we've used

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.590 
in this case it is and so we've used
those<00:01:35.130> different<00:01:35.460> attributes<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.180> surface

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
those different attributes of surface

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.630 
those different attributes of surface

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
a totally different kind of experience

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.109 
a totally different kind of experience

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
if you've got video you aren't running

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.190 
if you've got video you aren't running
you<00:01:42.899> can<00:01:43.079> actually<00:01:43.670> play<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.700> video<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.899> first

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
you can actually play a video the first

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.630 
you can actually play a video the first

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
of these units will go into bars

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.880 
of these units will go into bars
restaurants<00:01:48.119> casinos<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:49.229> retail<00:01:49.649> stores
