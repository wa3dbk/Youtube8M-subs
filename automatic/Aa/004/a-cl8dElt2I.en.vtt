00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:18.960
 what you do on a sad and dark day 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:22.230
 with the wind, the rain, the thunder is made 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.150
 rainbow cake or rainbow cake 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.090
 otherwise a murder takes place because 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.570
 sincerely sincerely brings one 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.910
 depression this time to the limits of 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.590
 psycho-function ie there are gestures 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.070
 unusual 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.289
 I didn't think I was hit good in 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.539
 late age from from this form of 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:45.690
 I always teased my meteoropathy 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:47.550
 my grandmother mother who went to the second 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.920
 of the time the mood and above all of mine 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.809
 mother instead I find myself not having one 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.789
 temperature suitable for my standards 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.190
 because if a pairing ceases if there is 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.980
 wind I complain if it's not there if it's there 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.170
 more angina chin if there is not that type 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.230
 of cloud I complain untamed chin 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.270
 continuously and make the rainbow keith la 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.550
 cake, as well as bringing some 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.380
 of color in our life could 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.810
 also be the limits of the therapeutic 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.090
 now I stop talking about demi e 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.490
 mental illnesses also because they are many 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.930
 and even psychological disorders throughout the 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.990
 my family because they are those too 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.500
 many and I proceed with regard to the 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.150
 colbun cake elena arcobaleno therefore 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.560
 it is simply a matter of paning 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.329
 I already made a base in Spain 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.460
 sponge cake where on the youtube channel 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.530
 that I leave the link below in the box 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.130
 information even if there is all the 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.649
 summary on the blog I decided to do the 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.090
 sponge cake as a base for several 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.670
 reasons that are in fact listed 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.340
 I am very sorry because he will have to 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.369
 read them are many reasons for us 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.429
 too much not to leave it with salt 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.840
 while regarding the frosting 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:01.509
 of course in the rainbow cake yes 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.460
 can decide whether to make a different one 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.159
 inside and then a different one 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.229
 outside and cover it eventually 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.399
 with the sugar paste I to not do 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.620
 much confusion 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.510
 I chose the simplest way indeed 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.430
 this is the first version of the red 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.129
 bull cake that I put into the 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.220
 meanwhile another that I will post later and 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:23.739
 this is very simple realization in 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.500
 how much used the classical one 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.989
 base of colored sponge cake 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.510
 simply by choosing him to make and 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.670
 choosing to do five bases on the count 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.690
 so you are not or seven that becomes 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.440
 even more difficult is a frosting 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:43.420
 very simple with white chocolate with 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:47.110
 album and is a kind of meringue we say 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:50.069
 with album and white chocolate and butter 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:54.610
 both inside and outside 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:56.889
 then covered it could be from dal 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.260
 sugar paste but let's say this 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:01.930
 then we do in the second recipe 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.120
 if he ever rho the cake of himself 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.130
 spain as happened to me in the part 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.799
 red is not a problem because the 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.030
 frosting will cement for this reason then 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.549
 the decorations 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.280
 of course it is always better to do them first 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:17.019
 now I look like you see horrible 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.700
 I was so scared it was 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.010
 first time I tried this frosting 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.790
 because I absolutely couldn't 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.260
 level to level it as I wanted in 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.359
 reality then during the phase of 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.180
 cooling because it should be stored in 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:36.040
 fridge just as the pictures show 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:39.730
 and he will try himself and he will succeed 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.459
 the miracle will appear much more leveled 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.590
 of what is apparently smart 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.540
 yes I did it just right 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.530
 solidify in the fridge not really yes 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.980
 talk about a 10 minutes 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.810
 so not too much and then I started 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.780
 to put all the smarties and the 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.569
 little stars the colored sugar beads 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.440
 naturally you can do them 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:05.390
 decorations that I prefer 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.209
 I really thank you very much for the 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:11.569
 registrations I do n't understand how you can 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:14.390
 inflict this is not true 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:18.290
 really very amazed and nothing there 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:20.660
 I refer to the blog where there is the summary 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.220
 it is the recipe that is really simple 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.410
 for any kind of questions there is the 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.900
 blog there are comments to no video 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.510
 a kiss thank you very much indeed 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.169
 very similar and we'll see you at 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.100
 next 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.100
 a kiss bye
