00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.479
 Hello, after a few weeks of laptop video, a few people asked me if I didn't 

00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:10.250
 What should I do with the cutting table? In this case, we can do one, so letâ€™s take 10 minutes. 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:17.250
 And 10 Australian dollars, or probably less than 10 Australian dollars to do one. 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:25.160
 What we need is a piece of wood used as a board, a wing nut and a bolt, and a piece. 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:33.330
 Used as the wood for the outer stage, so now, first we take the base from your 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.010
 Remove from the cutting table, 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:43.010
 Place the base and use a pencil to draw holes in the screw. 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:53.420
 About in the middle, it doesn't matter if it's not completely in the middle, then 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.530
 Let's drill and use the forstner drill 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.920
 Expand the hole a little. 

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:20.909
 Ok, I have found the central location, now I am going to drill out with a forstner drill 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.960
 Used to cut the hole position of the table. 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:30.960
 Ok, now that we have drilled the hole for the cutting table, it's time to install the backing plate. 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.319
 I use a small piece of wood. I have used this kind of thing for many years. I am very satisfied with it. 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:43.450
 If you need to do something higher, you can do something more complicated, 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.240
 For example, you can make a right angle to the board. For this small and quick practice, we will use this, 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.240
 This is all work if you are just doing corners or cutting a template or anything else. We only need 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.420
 Drill holes for it. 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.420
 And use a forstner drill to make a countersunk hole on the other side. 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:18.520
 Ok, now we are going to install the backing plate quickly, first screw the bolt from below. 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:30.470
 It is mounted on the board. 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:52.270
 The wing nut does not need to be tightened too tightly and can be fixed. Now to install the cutting table, we will 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.090
 Give the hole a screw. 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:04.090
 I used the original screw of the base of the cutting table and drilled a fairly deep hole with a forstner drill. 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:12.430
 Ideally you might want to use some longer bolts. 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.810
 And that's fine, it's that simple, I have my adjustable backing plate, and the cutting table is also mounted on the base. 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.410
 Now use them, all you have to do is clip it on the table, or you can clip it on a pair of saws 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:33.410
 And bring it to the scene. And for this one, I will clip it directly to the table. 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:47.350
 Usually 2 clips should be enough, then when setting up the board, what we have to do is put a clip there, 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:59.980
 Then we just have to put whatever we want to process, you know, cut a wall skirt, 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:08.760
 Use this even adjustable tool. This way I can easily lift my cutting table. 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:17.239
 There is no need to play around with it. You're done, it will work very well. 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.699
 Ok, let's do a quick test for it. I put a simple cut job here, just use this piece of wood to make a wall skirt. 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:29.699
 Then let's wear the safety equipment and do the cut work. 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.219
 Now, you can make some minor changes to this thing and let it work better for you. 

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:54.009
 You can make a bigger board, it's not difficult, just a few right angles of side reinforcement. 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:05:01.009
 So if you want to be a bit high, the other thing I often do is 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:08.669
 I have this small device, so if I want to cut the finger connection, you can see that I have plowed it, 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:14.610
 Then I can run it by adjusting the backing plate to move it. 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.860
 And that usually works very well for me. 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.680
 Ok, you can do this in 10 minutes or 15 minutes, and the cost is less than 10 Australian dollars. I hope you like it. 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.789
 This small and fast project is your turn, now you have no reason not to make one like that. 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:32.550
 The laptop table we made last week. Then click here to see the video, or if you want to learn 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.900
 How to make a wooden workbench with Kreg HD pocket clips, click here. I hope that we have done 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:44.900
 Enough for you to make a subscription, then take a look at those videos and then do something. 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:55.309
 Go, why are you still here? Go and cut something, pay attention to the wood and not cut yourself.
