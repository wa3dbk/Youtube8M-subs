00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.229
 hello very good to everyone because it's mine 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.120
 we are here in a series that 

00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:09.530
 much that did not put a chapter that has 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.660
 seen and quite that is mechanical 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.059
 ask champions and let's talk 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.250
 today from evelyn evelyn jungle and how like 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:19.400
 create the one since you are telling me a lot 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.800
 people who in the like bronze silver and gold 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.970
 it's pretty fucking to play against one of 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.670
 berlin more than anything because the team sees 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.040
 It helps us because it is not in jungle either 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.900
 whoever is worth something, war alone 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.970
 Uncles put a camp on one side 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.850
 and the time with it is done and well it is 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:38.300
 a little guides and some mechanics for 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.890
 try to play against a weak one and I'm not going 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.990
 to put the counter you know that Evelyn 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.000
 makes it invisible but is susceptible to 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.920
 people who reveal it this one is etcetera 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.840
 but I'm going to do that once I already 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.670
 applied berlin and ballistics with jungle 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.040
 a little the jungles that can fuck them 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.870
 well a little bit and if the other one applied 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.760
 to evelyn tropical atu jungle how 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.220
 move in the jungle to try to 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.630
 not minimize those damages 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.309
 let's start by talking about what they should 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.829
 prevent in two ways one is more 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.139
 frequent another is less frequent almost 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.560
 they are always seeing the link acb 

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:11.000
 adex tanks that is to say it becomes spiritual 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.670
 one about hexes or one sheet of 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.729
 reign and then everything gets tank and 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:20.240
 you 're seeing less evelyn ap the 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.790
 life but a little bit of it even if 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.800
 the one that less is used then and mount second 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.560
 in rne that so some game 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.660
 evelyn that has good de vélez 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.260
 Evelyn has the same good thing that she has 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:35.540
 badly explained the first level of the 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.960
 game is very very weak are playable 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.850
 that leaves very badly stopped of the first 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.110
 bufos and from the first camps and 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.090
 that's one of the mechanics that you can 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.530
 use to try to kill her hit him in the blind 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.390
 almost always by regent will start it on 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.880
 blue since it consumes a lot of mana with 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.860
 the q and it will go blue will go away surely 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.540
 to ghosts and then threw or it will be blue and 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.770
 Red one another ye are a minstrel 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.510
 have a good early with weight for 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.090
 leasing for example the pantheon 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.980
 I tried to make the metal diaz 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.740
 call that you have to camp the second 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.900
 bufo you put a white and the link will go very 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.630
 very bad of life then practically 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.460
 go to half life how the bufo starts that 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.140
 it has good this basically because in 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.580
 instead of picking up and staying the weed for 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.160
 wait what I have to do is 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.540
 catch in the red or they can be which in 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.370
 where you see red and see evelyn 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.090
 when I go to do it and stay in the 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.380
 another end of the brush once the 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.730
 undergrowth I want to say once 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.110
 Berlin is getting red 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.910
 take advantage of the fact that you are hitting the red 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.430
 take advantage of what is doing damage and that 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.959
 skills are enough and if it is spent 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.599
 normally the plane will go up the beech 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.859
 level 2 you can enter because the elevated 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.689
 attack but we also have 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:40.189
 is quite powerful at low level and os 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:42.739
 can fuck then good at the level of 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:44.450
 support easily kill another way is 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.540
 who commit crimes will always carry the 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.180
 same route from the gun that I heard the jungle 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.620
 or will almost always make a route 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.849
 linear and down to a frontal line 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.799
 another idea and lower than another line 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.900
 I also told you to look at the instant more 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.549
 Wristbands because evelyn is the list very 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.099
 arm in favor of the opponent 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:04.489
 normally input per line because if 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:06.109
 you enter by the river it is very easy that 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.209
 we have pink water and you can see them but 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:09.980
 by the line never equal pink then 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.810
 the link enters as you enter the counter 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.519
 down the line and once the other one the 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.810
 medio ccl topor has got to the cc del 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:19.939
 support from below you take and put the 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.349
 evelyn's damage and you can kill him what 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:24.700
 said the jungle as leasing as 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:27.230
 caciques as if they are going to even reign 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.239
 pantheon then this jungle can 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.370
 people play adelina beginning because 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.099
 suffers a lot also another option is to put 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.079
 some guard near the wolves so that 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.680
 you may see a little will make them the 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.569
 Wolves are the ghosts 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.480
 I also saw if the rock buy pink waters 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.400
 because really evelyn people are very 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.719
 cash in bronze silver and gold because the 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.219
 people do not know what against her people 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:49.290
 it is thought he is playing against aol and without 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:50.909
 weighing is playing against a pantheon and 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.319
 but watch routine is that you keep 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:53.730
 greens to belinda have them serve for 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.769
 nothing only when it is in visible form 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.079
 actions of the camps then 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:00.239
 good you have to wait to fuck him 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.639
 a lot because as the law expresses it came 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.930
 makes a pretty beast tank you have 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:06.239
 enough you thanks to the sheet of 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.810
 reclined and can burst games is 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:12.209
 Now that would be the velina of providing p 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.769
 basically is that gómez the gustazo in 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.989
 You fight and you are going to stay giving 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:18.239
 pinchitos with the q you are seeing 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.220
 so much because it does not have a little capacity 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.259
 real radio change the ey that that 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.919
 physical damage and which scale is better 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:28.320
 physical and such that makes evelyn be 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.240
 better to carry it hybrid runes and 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.130
 take her to d 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.169
 what else can we say about evelyn evelyn 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.130
 It's a bitch because it can change you 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.690
 the objectives 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.210
 very easily until they are very close 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.530
 you do not see her and according to the abe stage she 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.419
 they have wd little dragons of 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.160
 little boys then the option is 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:46.229
 that put a rose and as long as you can 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.910
 bring the evolved red trinque 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:50.210
 when session to team faith against evelyn 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.280
 always concentrate in latin fight 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.800
 evolution is the red trinque throw it 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.930
 over your heads and so you can 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.250
 have the oracle between a few seconds and 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.780
 can reveal if the inba for your 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.849
 charge because normally the goal of 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.370
 bilin would try for the carry and 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:06.259
 latin funk kill or get string 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.630
 charge the clock pk that closest you 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:10.669
 pille evil and is usually carried also in 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.889
 compositions with another tank or with a 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:14.840
 however in top and so to be able to feel 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:17.000
 damage between the two on the shield of 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.160
 evelyn of the last by goal so 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.569
 so much if you get together a lot you can fuck 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.889
 enough because you're going to a shield 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:25.130
 tremendous to a bug that is already in itself 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:27.889
 very tank that would be a bit like 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.960
 try to fuck the vale I against the 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:32.389
 war I always ask you to ask me pantheon or 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.580
 I ask almost c's more than anything because 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:35.840
 against kansas evelyn at the beginning the 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.789
 whores spend it is true that almost as 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.169
 is quite in the ugly does not get like 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:41.990
 got in before but still follows 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:45.229
 making it quite counter that attached to 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.940
 it is also good to put a rose 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:49.220
 behind your red or behind yours 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.720
 in order to propitiate a little the vision already 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.230
 that all of the same team have to 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.380
 save against this champion 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:06:00.010
 normally evelyn what is said is a 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.390
 character he already repeat ago 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:03.760
 but I want it to be very clear they have 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.500
 He is very bad and if you change them 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.880
 through the jungle like I said with the red 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.010
 throughout the team said of the 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.840
 quite the only thing to be careful not 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:13.060
 put in the mouth the wolf and that we 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.370
 get caught between the boti and the 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.410
 jungle or the mid the jungle boat returned 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:19.570
 walk jungle then with that would be a 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.490
 little bit really the mechanics for 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:23.770
 tell arabic lines that is to try 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.810
 the incoder what in the law that asks us 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.910
 all together and above all and above all 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.680
 cover quite at the cost of carry because 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.120
 will be thrown by him surely the fellow 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.100
 for the precarious that go more care of 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.870
 they will go to Melina for him then 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.870
 well I recommend to play to reign against 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:40.030
 she because she treats them to damage thing she spends 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:41.410
 at a low level so much to basically with 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.970
 rule you can devote with 9 lemon and 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.010
 with 90% you currently meet them 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:47.650
 against 90 percent with exactly with 

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:49.840
 You can dedicate yourself to change the 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:52.990
 buffs and add to look for him in the jungle 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:55.390
 and you are doing the necklace based on 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.650
 kill you underground jungle basically like this 

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.780
 Well, it's a short video 

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.190
 Nor has it been very long but 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.080
 really the mechanics to control 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:05.080
 are those I hope you liked this 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.780
 video I had known a section of 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.010
 these mechanics to tell champions what 

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.480
 said you liked the video like as 

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:12.490
 have your friends tell me that the champion
