hi this is Dave I've done a YouTube
video<00:00:03.120> in<00:00:03.360> a<00:00:03.419> while<00:00:03.659> but<00:00:04.700> I'm<00:00:05.700> just<00:00:05.970> recently

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
video in a while but I'm just recently

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.350 
video in a while but I'm just recently
trying<00:00:06.660> out<00:00:06.899> DSL<00:00:07.710> again<00:00:08.040> and<00:00:11.210> we're<00:00:12.210> going<00:00:12.330> to

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
trying out DSL again and we're going to

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.440 
trying out DSL again and we're going to
show<00:00:12.570> you<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:12.780> little<00:00:13.019> device<00:00:13.349> I<00:00:13.620> picked<00:00:13.830> up

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450 
show you a little device I picked up

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.450 
show you a little device I picked up
it's<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:17.330> yes<00:00:18.359> so<00:00:18.779> pot<00:00:19.650> splitter<00:00:20.250> that

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
it's a yes so pot splitter that

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.519 
it's a yes so pot splitter that
separates<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.210> voice<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.900> data<00:00:22.199> so<00:00:22.500> you

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
separates the voice and the data so you

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.380 
separates the voice and the data so you
don't<00:00:22.740> have<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.039> use<00:00:23.810> DSL<00:00:24.810> filters<00:00:26.180> inside<00:00:27.180> the

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
don't have to use DSL filters inside the

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.690 
don't have to use DSL filters inside the
house<00:00:30.080> the<00:00:31.080> type<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.320> says<00:00:31.650> network<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.520> then

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
house the type of says network and then

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.940 
house the type of says network and then
it<00:00:32.850> says<00:00:33.149> voice<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:34.050> then<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.260> says<00:00:34.410> data<00:00:34.770> at

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
it says voice and then it says data at

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.190 
it says voice and then it says data at
the<00:00:35.100> bottom<00:00:36.530> the<00:00:37.530> data<00:00:38.390> the<00:00:39.390> data<00:00:39.420> runs<00:00:39.930> on<00:00:40.050> its

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
the bottom the data the data runs on its

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.350 
the bottom the data the data runs on its
own<00:00:40.290> line<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.309> other<00:00:41.460> ones<00:00:41.730> off<00:00:41.969> the

and<00:01:42.560> made<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.590> drip<00:01:44.430> loop<00:01:44.640> here<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.030> was<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.329> was

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
and made a drip loop here it was it was

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.999 
and made a drip loop here it was it was
kind<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.689> down<00:01:45.840> low<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.560> can<00:01:46.710> see<00:01:46.860> where<00:01:46.950> all

kind of down low you can see where all

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.670 
kind of down low you can see where all
the<00:01:47.130> cobwebby<00:01:47.640> stuff<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.180> there<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.380> put

anyways<00:03:20.209> so<00:03:22.250> we'll<00:03:23.250> do<00:03:23.430> is<00:03:23.549> I'll<00:03:23.670> just<00:03:23.730> take

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
anyways so we'll do is I'll just take

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.080 
anyways so we'll do is I'll just take
this<00:03:27.440> close<00:03:28.440> that<00:03:28.709> up<00:03:28.739> this<00:03:29.310> is<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.730> S<00:03:29.850> I'll

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
this close that up this is the S I'll

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:38.059 
this close that up this is the S I'll
write<00:03:30.299> on<00:03:30.329> it<00:03:31.310> like<00:03:32.310> a<00:03:32.340> pipette<00:03:32.940> clip<00:03:37.040> -<00:03:38.040> I

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
write on it like a pipette clip - I

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:46.750 
write on it like a pipette clip - I
guess<00:03:38.370> right<00:03:39.329> now<00:03:42.799> and<00:03:43.799> then<00:03:43.980> I'll<00:03:44.160> just<00:03:44.370> uh

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
this just snaps that takes a lot of

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:53.960 
this just snaps that takes a lot of
pressure<00:03:49.680> to<00:03:49.829> release<00:03:50.730> it<00:03:51.000> but<00:03:52.790> wiring<00:03:53.790> is<00:03:53.880> all

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
pressure to release it but wiring is all

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.140 
pressure to release it but wiring is all

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.199 

you<00:04:17.979> know<00:04:18.100> Verizon<00:04:18.790> wouldn't<00:04:19.000> come<00:04:19.120> up

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
you know Verizon wouldn't come up

you know Verizon wouldn't come up
through<00:04:19.419> places<00:04:19.690> it<00:04:20.049> was<00:04:20.139> pretty<00:04:20.410> cheap<00:04:20.650> to

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
through places it was pretty cheap to

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.030 
through places it was pretty cheap to
get<00:04:20.979> one<00:04:21.130> of<00:04:21.250> these<00:04:21.370> so<00:04:21.990> there's<00:04:23.040> Verizon

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
get one of these so there's Verizon

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.700 
get one of these so there's Verizon
branded<00:04:24.520> so<00:04:24.990> this<00:04:25.990> is<00:04:26.139> a<00:04:26.169> subtle<00:04:26.650> brand<00:04:28.710> pot

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
branded so this is a subtle brand pot

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.240 
branded so this is a subtle brand pot
splitter<00:04:30.280> I<00:04:30.720> guess<00:04:31.720> the<00:04:31.930> idea<00:04:32.110> of<00:04:32.590> it<00:04:32.740> is<00:04:32.770> like

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
splitter I guess the idea of it is like

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.710 
splitter I guess the idea of it is like
I<00:04:33.280> said<00:04:33.580> to<00:04:33.729> eliminate<00:04:34.240> any<00:04:34.990> kind<00:04:35.350> of

I said to eliminate any kind of

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.560 
I said to eliminate any kind of
splitters<00:04:37.720> in<00:04:37.990> the<00:04:38.080> house<00:04:39.060> type<00:04:40.060> lectures

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570
