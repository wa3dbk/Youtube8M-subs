00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
about these two sets I think they

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.570 
about these two sets I think they
started<00:01:57.479> selling<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:58.020> move<00:01:58.260> the<00:01:58.530> arm<00:01:58.770> as<00:01:59.280> far

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
as the classic collection I think

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.690

they've<00:02:01.979> started<00:02:02.220> selling<00:02:02.610> them

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.250 
they've started selling them
individually<00:02:04.610> so<00:02:05.610> if<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.030> don't<00:02:06.180> want<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:07.110> get
