00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
to style it to the side and this is what

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.249 
to style it to the side and this is what
it<00:01:57.630> looks<00:01:57.780> like<00:01:57.869> so<00:01:58.380> far

happens and um yeah so instead of using
a<00:02:21.650> pick<00:02:22.040> I<00:02:22.190> decide<00:02:22.550> to<00:02:22.580> use<00:02:22.760> my<00:02:23.000> fingers<00:02:23.450> and
