 put on it the latest patch on this 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.440

 but let's say from the court 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.810
 it's all fast 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.080

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.380
 server information and you can already 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.430
 To start playing games, the map is also clear 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.650
 if you have no cards 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.340

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.520

 this principle 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.360
 the festival of course only the game can and 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.070

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.530
 it's like training 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.050
 choose a character 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.310
 one of six i.e. there is a team 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.550
 medical camp

 Mansiysk I joined the answer 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.250
 already been destroyed unfortunately learned 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.450
 again another map 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.300
 to the character pumped 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.500
 pumped they gave a level I won't say until 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.879
 what because i don't remember already 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.700
 constantly played updated 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.559
 new characters appear new 

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:21.659
 Monsters map or Nemer just new 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.949
 so to rivalry through life will remove the new 

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:28.409
 the fleet gives unfortunately this text it 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.409
 plain text of which 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.249
 you play beglitis cannon everything 

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:38.249
 groups all map run all isovit 

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:40.839
 omega with incredible speed and seasonal 

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:42.279
 move slowly 

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:45.279
 and filling enap adato him with waves 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:48.759
 they attack waves on copper 

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:51.439
 and its 10 waves you need to survive the concert itself 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:54.529
 is one vote which dunk 

00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:56.579
 and you defeat him, that is 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.079
 pass the card do not win 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:59.529
 respectively 

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:01.079
 all have to start over at 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.079
 another card 

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:10.219
 wherever you hide on this 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:12.319
 map of the zone of you she is at it they will be waves 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.219
 intends to file 100 and scene standards 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:17.609
 Calsin on servers of six people but 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:18.769
 there are servers 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.409
 where there are 30 people playing sheer there 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.109
 zombies will be somewhere around one and a half 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.109
 thousands and more happens 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:34.299
 that's his own and shoot a shame for 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.259
 nation is desirable 

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:40.259
 everything was successful 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.709
 and trying to survive strictly speaking it 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.709
 survival 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.689
 for murder accrue money in 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:51.400
 the end of each he see in the shop 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.400
 buy weapons 

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:57.999
 I do not find this game minuses 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:02.189
 because even if you are average 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:04.059
 car you have it this game will take place on 

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:05.569
 medium settings 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.279
 and I wouldn't even fade away I just don't have 

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:11.569
 The main thing in this game is the graphics 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:13.129
 this is a very big plus that you personally 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:15.449
 the city council would not want to 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:16.129
 to 

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:18.769
 the graphics were a little better but 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.769
 And in this chip this game therefore 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.590
 we miss the graphics 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.699
 new names any machine principle she 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:29.650
 must go you 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.080
 collect all free all 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.900
 free moment created here wave 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.919
 the first one ends and we shop her 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.349
 buy weapons 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:38.680
 the choice of weapons is huge 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.059
 but 

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:43.199
 he is suspected by classes if you 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.360
 team shopper tries to table 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.819
 automatic demolition weapon 2 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:51.020
 minute tech dhabi century 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.020
 and so on 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.400
 in general, but I strongly advise such a game 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.560
 for playing on your computer must 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.610
 be 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.370
 Doctors recommend and work in the morning 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.229
 to play 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:15.229
 and after work to relieve tension 

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:17.849
 king flo actually
