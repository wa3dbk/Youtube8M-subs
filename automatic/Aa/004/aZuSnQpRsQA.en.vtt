00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.890
 very good morning thanks for joining us 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.440
 this morning today we are going to prepare a 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:20.980
 type cheese sauce melted let's go with the 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:24.160
 cheese sauce type ingredients melted 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:27.190
 2 tablespoons flour 2 tablespoons 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.350
 butter 200 milliliters of milk a 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.500
 room temperature a quarter cup 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.989
 of white wine 200 grams of cheese type 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.070
 monterrey 100 grams of cheese type 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:42.070
 Manchego 50 grams of Parmesan cheese 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.409
 nutmeg a pinch salt and pepper 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.750
 taste and peasant type bread for 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:48.700
 accompany 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.530
 well back to the table ready 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.630
 the ingredients for the recipe today and 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.239
 my proposal this morning is a sauce of 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.730
 fondue cheese which we are going to 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.100
 elaborate with ingredients that are a 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.559
 little more economical because he in the case 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.050
 of the background is made with emmental cheese 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.940
 Gorgonzola some other types of cheeses 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.310
 Europeans who sometimes do not meet 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.500
 scope of our budget that's why 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.810
 the proposal this morning is to do 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.369
 something very similar and also with a 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.830
 presentation that is surely going to 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.440
 like a lot there are different types of 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.080
 refractory molds where the fund is 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.970
 place and generally with a base of 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.460
 heat so that the cheese is hot and 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.590
 I can continue with this smooth consistency 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.450
 of melted in this case how are we going to 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.180
 do something if we do not have the possibility 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.610
 to buy it or have it at home we are going to 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.680
 use the bread that equally well the 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.899
 bread serves us to accompany the cheese in 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.509
 this case I found this guy 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:46.509
 campesino what we are going to do is go 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:49.240
 to make a hole a hole in the center 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:52.420
 with a knife of preference that of 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.470
 these are for bread type sierrita 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.550
 let's cut 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.550
 center 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.880
 very carefully we are going to take this 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.060
 first part 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.819
 here we already have it and we are going to remove it 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.310
 the crumb that is inside we are going to 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.940
 download it very carefully so that 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.200
 then we can place the presentation 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.140
 of our forgiveness so that after 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.269
 we can put our cheese sauce and 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.489
 this serves as the recipient where 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.280
 we can do it by hand or with a 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:30.310
 teaspoon will start scraping until 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.180
 let's have a container where we're going to 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.969
 put our sauce 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.180
 Well, here we have downloaded part of the 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:41.310
 Migajon of this bread is very important 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.530
 that we leave in the part of the bottom not us 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.540
 we scratch too much because we need 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.909
 a good base for our sauce 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.889
 that will be hot do not go to 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:51.810
 break down and this in the case of wanting 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:54.540
 move it after an accident happens 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.430
 let's leave a somewhat thick layer 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.739
 rather we are going to remove the migajón 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.049
 of the edge and we are going to conserve and here already 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:04.560
 I removed a part of this crumb 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.819
 bread so that we have the cover and 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.879
 leave it also for presentation 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:11.760
 final now yes let's go to the stove to 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:13.829
 prepare our cheese sauce as 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.819
 we are ready to start with the 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:19.950
 process for this cheese sauce we're going to 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:23.069
 prepare a base that in this case we have 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.620
 made the recipe previously a rune 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:29.900
 white sauce a béchamel sauce and let's go 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.900
 to use two tablespoons of butter 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.620
 let's wait we have average flame 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.790
 let's hope that the butter will 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:42.489
 found a little bit we are going to add a little 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:46.400
 nothing more than olive oil instead of 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:49.010
 add a little more butter 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.900
 let's put two we have put two 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.450
 Spoons of butter 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.090
 let's put the amount of flour two 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.599
 spoonfuls of flour let's move 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:02.160
 quick to remove the raw taste 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:05.370
 to our butter 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:08.190
 to our forgiveness and in this case since 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.350
 this has been integrated let's start 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.650
 add milk 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:16.530
 of a poquitos important at this time 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.260
 we have average flare integrating integrate 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.780
 integrate here the work that we are going to 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:25.020
 do with the beater is important to see 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.560
 as it starts to thicken we add a little 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.530
 more milk 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.770
 we continue integrating we continue to flame 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:36.130
 mean we're going to put a little bit more 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.130
 milk 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:43.310
 we continue integrating 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.500
 this is going to thicken slightly and we're going to 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.590
 put the cheeses afterwards which is what 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.689
 is going to give the flavor to this sauce here 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.969
 we already have our base we have scratched the 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:55.370
 cheese let's start here since you saw that 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:58.789
 is integrating a bit we are going to lower 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.889
 the flame and put a little more milk 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:03.770
 before placing the cheeses that 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:06.800
 previously we have scratched so that we 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.750
 help integrate better all 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:13.039
 this preparation we will put flavor 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:15.139
 with a little nutmeg if the 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:17.060
 we have it in powder we have it as a carla 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:20.090
 in this presentation just the 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:22.550
 We're going to grate, we 're not going to 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.349
 add salt until the end because here 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.389
 Our cheeses have a quantity 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:28.939
 considerable salt then in the end let's 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:32.430
 to rectify the season we start with the 

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:36.520
 Calladito the monterrey cheese 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:40.080
 and let's start climbing flame 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.080
 and start integrating everything 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:47.949
 let's put the parmesan 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:58.170
 and here it is time to put some 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:02.400
 white wine if you have it would be 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:04.770
 excellent if you can not skip what the wine 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.520
 It will give a stronger flavor to this 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.800
 flavor to the flavors of the cheeses 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.900
 the alcohol certainly with the heat 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.479
 it's going to evaporate and it's going to 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.699
 remain the concentration of taste and for 

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:19.699
 last we are going to put the pieces of 

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:22.639
 Manchego cheese and let's wait for nothing 

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:25.370
 more than this thicken and rectify the 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:27.770
 then we are ready for 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:30.800
 fill look here was this 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.900
 consistency we have it slightly 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.720
 lukewarm we have hoped that this once 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:38.750
 I turned it off we waited about 34 minutes 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.729
 so we can have warm the 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.949
 preparation before passing it because the 

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:44.509
 As it is too hot it can 

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:46.520
 be that he stops especially the part of 

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:49.849
 down then we fall apart here 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:52.580
 we have our sauce ready and seen 

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:55.569
 What we are going to do is fill 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.569
 our bread 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.980
 very carefully 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:07.680
 and we have our presentation ready 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:10.080
 with this fondue type cheese sauce like 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:13.620
 I told them we booked in this case 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:15.930
 the top part we can cover it 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.670
 a different way not to match 

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.230
 because here we are going to stay all 

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:21.540
 will hit us a lot but we're going to 

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:23.580
 put in a contrary way we can 

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:25.290
 present to the table and when our 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.450
 diners our guests our 

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:29.670
 family discover what's inside 

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:33.120
 everyone will go for their pinchos 

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:36.420
