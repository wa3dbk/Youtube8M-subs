00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
listing these things and they're

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.840

because they're cashing in there is it

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.010 
because they're cashing in there is it
as<00:02:07.619> it's<00:02:07.860> putting<00:02:08.069> more<00:02:08.369> in<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:09.000> because<00:02:09.899> I've

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
as it's putting more in and because I've

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.229 
as it's putting more in and because I've
reached<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.590> limit<00:02:10.860> of<00:02:10.890> 40<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.580> because<00:02:12.120> I've

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
reached the limit of 40 and because I've

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.460 
reached the limit of 40 and because I've
gone<00:02:12.720> through<00:02:12.780> and

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
gone through and

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.270 
gone through and
many<00:02:13.710> have<00:02:13.860> failed<00:02:15.590> as<00:02:16.590> your<00:02:16.770> listing<00:02:17.130> more

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
many have failed as your listing more

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.920 
many have failed as your listing more
it's<00:02:17.430> allowing<00:02:17.850> you<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.090> do<00:02:18.240> it<00:02:18.420> because<00:02:18.510> it's

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
it's allowing you to do it because it's

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.630 
it's allowing you to do it because it's
literally<00:02:19.320> a<00:02:19.470> book<00:02:19.710> that<00:02:19.920> there's<00:02:20.130> no<00:02:20.280> no

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
literally a book that there's no no

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.670 
literally a book that there's no no
handle<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.810> catch<00:02:22.020> anything<00:02:22.260> that's<00:02:22.530> going

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
handle to to catch anything that's going

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.390 
handle to to catch anything that's going
wrong<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:24.620> as<00:02:25.620> your<00:02:25.740> listing<00:02:26.070> more<00:02:26.250> it's

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
wrong and as your listing more it's

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.800 
wrong and as your listing more it's
appearing<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.880> things<00:02:27.060> are<00:02:27.180> disappearing

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
appearing the things are disappearing

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.380 
appearing the things are disappearing
and<00:02:27.930> so<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.920> solution<00:02:29.340> is<00:02:29.460> you<00:02:29.700> go<00:02:30.060> into<00:02:30.270> the

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
and so the solution is you go into the

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.660 
and so the solution is you go into the
club<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:30.870> quick<00:02:31.170> sell<00:02:31.470> what's<00:02:32.370> failed

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
club and you quick sell what's failed

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.120 
club and you quick sell what's failed
because<00:02:33.030> then<00:02:33.300> that<00:02:33.330> clears<00:02:34.020> out<00:02:34.290> of<00:02:34.530> a<00:02:34.710> very

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
because then that clears out of a very

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.400 
because then that clears out of a very
invisible<00:02:35.400> listing<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.150> trade<00:02:36.390> pile<00:02:36.630> and<00:02:36.870> you

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
invisible listing the trade pile and you

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.920 
invisible listing the trade pile and you
will<00:02:37.590> see<00:02:37.800> that<00:02:38.340> those<00:02:38.670> those<00:02:39.060> cards<00:02:39.450> reappear

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
will see that those those cards reappear

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.320 
will see that those those cards reappear
in<00:02:39.960> your<00:02:40.290> in<00:02:40.590> your<00:02:40.650> trade<00:02:41.070> pile<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.640> but<00:02:42.270> if

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
in your in your trade pile and but if
