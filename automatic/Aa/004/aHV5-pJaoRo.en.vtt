not<00:02:32.239> going<00:02:32.390> to<00:02:32.420> snap<00:02:32.720> it<00:02:32.750> in<00:02:33.019> on<00:02:33.140> this<00:02:33.230> video

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
not going to snap it in on this video

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.339 
not going to snap it in on this video
because<00:02:33.940> sometimes<00:02:34.940> they're<00:02:35.260> tricky<00:02:36.260> to

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
because sometimes they're tricky to

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.680 
because sometimes they're tricky to
remove<00:02:36.650> once<00:02:37.010> they're<00:02:37.220> snapped<00:02:37.489> in<00:02:37.670> place<00:02:37.940> but

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
remove once they're snapped in place but

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.910 
remove once they're snapped in place but
I'm<00:02:38.840> using<00:02:39.110> this<00:02:39.410> particular<00:02:39.860> Decorah<00:02:40.670> as<00:02:41.920> an

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
I'm using this particular Decorah as an

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.890 
I'm using this particular Decorah as an
example<00:02:43.280> because<00:02:43.760> you<00:02:43.970> could<00:02:44.150> put<00:02:44.269> a<00:02:44.330> cable<00:02:44.720> TV

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
example because you could put a cable TV

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.960 
example because you could put a cable TV
outlet<00:02:45.440> here<00:02:45.709> or<00:02:45.920> you<00:02:46.040> could<00:02:46.190> put<00:02:46.310> a<00:02:46.370> second

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
outlet here or you could put a second

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.300 
outlet here or you could put a second
phone<00:02:47.480> jack<00:02:47.840> here<00:02:48.260> or<00:02:48.470> you<00:02:48.769> could<00:02:48.920> put<00:02:49.100> some

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
phone jack here or you could put some

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.550 
phone jack here or you could put some
other<00:02:49.459> type<00:02:49.790> of<00:02:49.819> structured<00:02:50.630> wire<00:02:50.810> insert<00:02:51.319> in

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
other type of structured wire insert in

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.920 
other type of structured wire insert in
here<00:02:51.860> and<00:02:52.040> then<00:02:52.580> again<00:02:52.880> to<00:02:53.209> finish<00:02:53.480> this<00:02:53.690> one

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
here and then again to finish this one

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.949 
here and then again to finish this one
off<00:02:54.760> this<00:02:55.760> plate<00:02:56.090> goes<00:02:57.080> right<00:02:57.380> over<00:02:57.680> like<00:02:57.830> that

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
off this plate goes right over like that

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.039 
off this plate goes right over like that
now<00:03:00.370> another<00:03:01.370> way<00:03:01.700> is<00:03:02.030> you<00:03:02.480> can<00:03:02.630> just<00:03:02.810> get<00:03:03.019> a

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
now another way is you can just get a

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.640 
now another way is you can just get a
plate<00:03:03.349> that<00:03:03.380> has<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:04.660> insert<00:03:05.660> hole<00:03:05.959> in<00:03:06.230> it<00:03:06.380> you

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
plate that has the insert hole in it you

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.710 
plate that has the insert hole in it you
flip<00:03:06.860> it<00:03:06.980> over<00:03:07.220> make<00:03:07.760> sure<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:08.090> arrow<00:03:08.269> is<00:03:08.510> up

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
flip it over make sure the arrow is up

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.809 
flip it over make sure the arrow is up
and<00:03:08.900> then<00:03:09.500> you<00:03:09.650> snap<00:03:09.950> that<00:03:10.220> in<00:03:10.340> place<00:03:10.549> like

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
and then you snap that in place like

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.479 
and then you snap that in place like
that<00:03:10.849> and<00:03:11.530> again<00:03:12.530> I'm<00:03:12.680> not<00:03:12.709> snapping<00:03:13.280> it<00:03:13.370> in

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
that and again I'm not snapping it in

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:14.920 
that and again I'm not snapping it in
place<00:03:13.670> because<00:03:13.819> it's<00:03:14.060> difficult<00:03:14.510> to<00:03:14.630> remove

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
place because it's difficult to remove

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.620 
place because it's difficult to remove
but<00:03:15.680> you<00:03:15.860> can<00:03:16.010> see<00:03:16.250> that's<00:03:16.610> a<00:03:16.819> way<00:03:17.000> of<00:03:17.030> creating

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
but you can see that's a way of creating

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.319 
but you can see that's a way of creating
a<00:03:17.690> phone<00:03:17.900> jack<00:03:18.200> as<00:03:18.470> well<00:03:18.880> all<00:03:19.880> right<00:03:19.940> let's

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
a phone jack as well all right let's

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:23.020 
a phone jack as well all right let's
begin<00:03:20.480> I've<00:03:20.870> got<00:03:21.079> my<00:03:21.260> cat5<00:03:21.799> wire<00:03:22.160> here<00:03:22.640> this<00:03:22.880> is

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
begin I've got my cat5 wire here this is

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.720 
begin I've got my cat5 wire here this is
actually<00:03:23.239> cat<00:03:23.720> 5e<00:03:24.100> there's<00:03:25.100> no<00:03:25.280> real

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
actually cat 5e there's no real

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.640 
actually cat 5e there's no real
difference<00:03:25.940> between<00:03:26.269> cat<00:03:26.750> 5<00:03:26.959> and<00:03:27.170> kapha<00:03:27.470> v

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
difference between cat 5 and kapha v

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.789 
difference between cat 5 and kapha v
other<00:03:27.950> than<00:03:28.750> there<00:03:29.750> are<00:03:29.780> more<00:03:30.019> twists<00:03:30.590> per

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
other than there are more twists per

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.759 
other than there are more twists per
foot<00:03:31.640> or<00:03:31.850> meter<00:03:32.060> so<00:03:32.930> I'm<00:03:33.170> just<00:03:33.319> going<00:03:33.440> to<00:03:33.470> strip

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
foot or meter so I'm just going to strip

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.349 
foot or meter so I'm just going to strip
back<00:03:33.890> a<00:03:33.950> little<00:03:34.190> bit<00:03:34.370> of<00:03:34.489> this<00:03:34.579> blue<00:03:34.819> jacket

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
back a little bit of this blue jacket

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:41.650 
back a little bit of this blue jacket
here<00:03:37.450> kind<00:03:38.450> of<00:03:38.480> go<00:03:38.630> all<00:03:38.750> the<00:03:38.870> way<00:03:38.900> around<00:03:39.640> and<00:03:40.660> I

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
here kind of go all the way around and I

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.360 
here kind of go all the way around and I
pull<00:03:41.900> that<00:03:41.930> out<00:03:42.109> like<00:03:42.410> that<00:03:42.560> and<00:03:42.829> then<00:03:42.980> you<00:03:43.130> see

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
pull that out like that and then you see

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.770 
pull that out like that and then you see
that<00:03:43.400> I<00:03:43.640> have<00:03:45.160> four<00:03:46.160> pairs<00:03:46.609> of<00:03:46.700> wire<00:03:46.970> and<00:03:47.299> then

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
that I have four pairs of wire and then

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.050 
that I have four pairs of wire and then
I<00:03:47.810> have<00:03:48.019> this<00:03:48.109> little<00:03:48.170> ripcord<00:03:48.829> I<00:03:49.190> like<00:03:49.730> to<00:03:49.850> cut

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
I have this little ripcord I like to cut

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.970 
I have this little ripcord I like to cut
that<00:03:50.209> out<00:03:50.389> because<00:03:51.430> tends<00:03:52.430> to<00:03:52.639> get<00:03:52.760> in<00:03:52.880> the<00:03:52.970> way

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
that out because tends to get in the way

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.280 
that out because tends to get in the way
so<00:03:54.980> because<00:03:55.790> we're<00:03:56.180> only<00:03:56.329> demonstrating<00:03:57.139> how

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
so because we're only demonstrating how

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.890 
so because we're only demonstrating how
to<00:03:57.319> do<00:03:57.590> a<00:03:57.620> phone<00:03:58.010> jack<00:03:58.569> we're<00:03:59.569> not<00:03:59.720> going<00:03:59.870> to

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
to do a phone jack we're not going to

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.330 
to do a phone jack we're not going to
use<00:03:59.959> these<00:04:00.260> other<00:04:00.470> three<00:04:00.829> pair<00:04:01.069> in<00:04:01.220> this

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
use these other three pair in this

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.800 
use these other three pair in this
particular<00:04:01.700> video<00:04:02.090> so<00:04:02.389> I'm<00:04:02.480> just<00:04:02.600> going<00:04:02.780> to

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
particular video so I'm just going to

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.319 
particular video so I'm just going to
set<00:04:03.019> those<00:04:03.170> to<00:04:03.380> the<00:04:03.410> side<00:04:03.579> now<00:04:04.579> you'll<00:04:04.970> notice

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
set those to the side now you'll notice

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:08.500 
set those to the side now you'll notice
that<00:04:05.780> the<00:04:06.470> wires<00:04:06.739> twisted<00:04:07.100> and<00:04:07.639> that<00:04:07.970> is<00:04:08.239> to

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
that the wires twisted and that is to

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.680 
that the wires twisted and that is to
help<00:04:09.069> prevent<00:04:10.069> noise<00:04:10.549> from<00:04:11.540> outside

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
help prevent noise from outside

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.900 
help prevent noise from outside
electrical<00:04:12.680> interference<00:04:13.040> crossing<00:04:13.670> onto

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
electrical interference crossing onto

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.120 
electrical interference crossing onto
the<00:04:14.000> wire<00:04:14.150> so<00:04:14.780> you<00:04:14.840> want<00:04:15.170> to<00:04:15.230> try<00:04:15.590> to<00:04:15.650> keep<00:04:15.950> the

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
the wire so you want to try to keep the

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.890 
the wire so you want to try to keep the
wire<00:04:16.340> twisted<00:04:17.150> like<00:04:17.329> that<00:04:18.220> and<00:04:19.900> fortunately

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
wire twisted like that and fortunately

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.040 
wire twisted like that and fortunately
the<00:04:21.139> way<00:04:21.229> I<00:04:21.260> cut<00:04:21.620> it<00:04:21.799> I<00:04:22.120> have<00:04:23.120> enough<00:04:23.479> to<00:04:23.660> do<00:04:23.810> the

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
the way I cut it I have enough to do the

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.270 
the way I cut it I have enough to do the
punch<00:04:24.710> down<00:04:24.979> so<00:04:25.729> now<00:04:26.150> I'm<00:04:26.330> going<00:04:26.479> to<00:04:26.570> take<00:04:26.810> my

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
punch down so now I'm going to take my

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.960 
punch down so now I'm going to take my
insert

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
insert

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.200 
insert
and<00:04:29.660> I'm<00:04:29.960> just<00:04:30.230> going<00:04:30.440> to<00:04:30.560> follow<00:04:30.890> the<00:04:31.210> color

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
and I'm just going to follow the color

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.050
