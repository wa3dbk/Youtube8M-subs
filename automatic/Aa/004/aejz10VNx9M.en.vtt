the sweet sleep wake button now because

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.320 
the sweet sleep wake button now because
there<00:04:03.220> have<00:04:03.310> been<00:04:03.430> a<00:04:03.459> few<00:04:03.550> photos<00:04:04.090> of<00:04:04.120> this

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
there have been a few photos of this

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:10.860 
there have been a few photos of this
around<00:04:04.680> people<00:04:05.680> have<00:04:05.800> asked<00:04:06.330> what's<00:04:07.330> this

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.050 

some<00:04:11.620> have<00:04:11.769> even<00:04:11.860> said<00:04:12.190> this<00:04:12.430> doesn't<00:04:12.819> seem

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
some have even said this doesn't seem

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:21.030 
some have even said this doesn't seem
like<00:04:13.120> Apple<00:04:16.530> what<00:04:17.530> are<00:04:17.799> these<00:04:18.299> lines<00:04:19.859> in<00:04:20.859> this

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
like Apple what are these lines in this

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.750 
like Apple what are these lines in this
beautiful<00:04:21.310> stainless<00:04:21.850> steel<00:04:22.270> band<00:04:23.490> well<00:04:24.490> it

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
beautiful stainless steel band well it

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.659 
beautiful stainless steel band well it
turns<00:04:24.820> out<00:04:25.500> there's<00:04:26.500> not<00:04:26.740> just<00:04:26.770> one<00:04:27.130> of<00:04:27.490> them

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
turns out there's not just one of them

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:32.400 
turns out there's not just one of them
there's<00:04:28.330> three<00:04:28.840> of<00:04:28.870> them<00:04:29.050> and<00:04:30.750> they<00:04:31.750> are<00:04:31.930> part

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
there's three of them and they are part

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.490 
there's three of them and they are part
of<00:04:32.710> the<00:04:33.669> entire<00:04:34.150> structure<00:04:34.810> of<00:04:35.110> this<00:04:35.260> phone

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
of the entire structure of this phone

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.260 
of the entire structure of this phone
that<00:04:35.800> stainless<00:04:36.130> steel<00:04:36.550> band<00:04:36.880> that<00:04:37.090> runs

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
that stainless steel band that runs

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.080 
that stainless steel band that runs
around<00:04:37.419> is<00:04:37.780> the<00:04:38.260> primary<00:04:38.650> structural<00:04:39.550> element

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
around is the primary structural element

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.020 
around is the primary structural element
of<00:04:40.180> the<00:04:40.240> phone<00:04:40.479> and<00:04:41.280> there<00:04:42.280> are<00:04:42.430> these<00:04:42.580> three

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
of the phone and there are these three

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.770 
of the phone and there are these three
slits<00:04:43.449> in<00:04:43.660> it<00:04:43.750> it<00:04:43.930> turns<00:04:44.380> out<00:04:44.910> this<00:04:45.910> is<00:04:46.180> part<00:04:46.600> of

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
slits in it it turns out this is part of

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.710 
slits in it it turns out this is part of
some<00:04:47.740> brilliant<00:04:48.310> engineering<00:04:48.850> which

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
some brilliant engineering which

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.650 
some brilliant engineering which
actually<00:04:50.370> uses<00:04:51.370> the<00:04:51.400> stainless<00:04:52.090> steel<00:04:52.120> band

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
actually uses the stainless steel band

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.779 
actually uses the stainless steel band
as<00:04:52.990> part<00:04:53.380> of<00:04:53.470> the<00:04:53.590> antenna<00:04:54.070> system<00:04:54.669> and<00:04:55.199> so<00:04:56.789> one

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:57.789 
as part of the antenna system and so one

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:02.939 
as part of the antenna system and so one
piece<00:04:58.229> is<00:04:59.229> Bluetooth<00:04:59.889> Wi-Fi<00:05:00.240> GPS<00:05:01.240> and<00:05:01.949> the

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:02.949 
piece is Bluetooth Wi-Fi GPS and the

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:06.120 
piece is Bluetooth Wi-Fi GPS and the
other<00:05:03.130> is<00:05:03.340> UMTS<00:05:03.820> and<00:05:03.940> gsm<00:05:04.150> so<00:05:05.110> it's<00:05:05.410> got<00:05:05.650> these

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
other is UMTS and gsm so it's got these

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.120 
other is UMTS and gsm so it's got these
integrated<00:05:06.760> antennas<00:05:07.510> right<00:05:08.320> in<00:05:08.680> the

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
integrated antennas right in the

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.159 
integrated antennas right in the
structure<00:05:09.610> of<00:05:09.820> the<00:05:09.970> phone<00:05:10.300> it's<00:05:10.570> never<00:05:10.930> been

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
structure of the phone it's never been

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:13.350 
structure of the phone it's never been
done<00:05:11.229> before<00:05:11.590> and<00:05:12.070> it's<00:05:12.789> really<00:05:13.150> cool

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
done before and it's really cool

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:22.920 
done before and it's really cool
engineering<00:05:14.220> so<00:05:21.330> it's<00:05:22.330> the<00:05:22.450> thinnest

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
engineering so it's the thinnest

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.420 
engineering so it's the thinnest
smartphone<00:05:23.080> ever<00:05:25.020> it<00:05:26.020> uses<00:05:26.320> stainless<00:05:27.130> steel

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
smartphone ever it uses stainless steel

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.379 
smartphone ever it uses stainless steel
for<00:05:27.820> strength<00:05:28.950> it<00:05:29.950> uses<00:05:30.250> glass<00:05:30.729> on<00:05:31.120> the<00:05:31.150> front

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:31.389 
for strength it uses glass on the front

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:33.510 
for strength it uses glass on the front
in<00:05:31.570> the<00:05:31.630> back<00:05:31.840> for<00:05:32.080> optical<00:05:32.770> quality<00:05:33.340> and

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
in the back for optical quality and

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.740 
in the back for optical quality and
scratch<00:05:34.270> resistance<00:05:36.150> it's<00:05:37.150> got<00:05:37.389> integrated

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
scratch resistance it's got integrated

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.689 
scratch resistance it's got integrated
antennas<00:05:38.680> and<00:05:40.530> extraordinary<00:05:41.530> build<00:05:42.340> quality

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:42.699 
antennas and extraordinary build quality

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:44.939 
antennas and extraordinary build quality
again<00:05:43.510> I<00:05:43.810> don't<00:05:44.199> think<00:05:44.530> there's<00:05:44.680> another

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:44.949 
again I don't think there's another

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:47.700 
again I don't think there's another
consumer<00:05:45.370> product<00:05:45.880> like<00:05:46.060> this<00:05:46.380> when<00:05:47.380> you<00:05:47.470> hold

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
consumer product like this when you hold

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.870 
consumer product like this when you hold
this<00:05:47.889> in<00:05:48.039> your<00:05:48.070> hands<00:05:48.720> it's<00:05:49.720> unbelievable<00:05:50.880> so

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
this in your hands it's unbelievable so

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.990 
this in your hands it's unbelievable so
this<00:05:52.180> is<00:05:52.419> our<00:05:52.720> all-new<00:05:53.199> design<00:05:53.820> for<00:05:54.820> the
