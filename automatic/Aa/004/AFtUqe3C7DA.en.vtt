possible<00:00:25.460> what<00:00:26.460> an<00:00:26.640> unlock<00:00:27.060> is<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.599> it

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
possible what an unlock is is it

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.740 
possible what an unlock is is it
basically<00:00:28.560> allows<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.789> use<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.029> different

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
basically allows you to use a different

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.380 
basically allows you to use a different
carrier<00:00:31.050> then<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:32.099> then<00:00:32.669> your<00:00:32.850> phone<00:00:33.090> is

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
carrier then you then your phone is

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.600 
carrier then you then your phone is
locked<00:00:33.660> too<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.320> if<00:00:34.440> your<00:00:34.620> iphone<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:35.070> locked

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
locked too so if your iphone is locked

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.340 
locked too so if your iphone is locked
to<00:00:36.329> AT&amp;T<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:38.210> you're<00:00:39.210> not<00:00:39.390> on<00:00:39.540> ATT<00:00:40.050> maybe

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
to AT&amp;T and you're not on ATT maybe

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.260 
to AT&amp;T and you're not on ATT maybe
you're<00:00:40.950> on<00:00:41.070> t-mobile<00:00:41.370> or<00:00:41.850> something<00:00:42.180> like

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
you're on t-mobile or something like

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.810 
you're on t-mobile or something like
that<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.870> can<00:00:43.020> unlock<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.739> then<00:00:44.430> put<00:00:44.460> your

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
that you can unlock it and then put your

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.930 
that you can unlock it and then put your
other<00:00:45.239> sim<00:00:45.840> card<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.950> will<00:00:47.100> work<00:00:47.340> so

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
other sim card in and it will work so

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.819 
other sim card in and it will work so
