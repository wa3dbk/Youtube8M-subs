more<00:00:27.900> driving<00:00:28.830> me<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.070> nuts<00:00:29.449> for<00:00:30.449> a

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
more driving me and nuts for a

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.479 
more driving me and nuts for a
three-week<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.650> they<00:00:31.830> had<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.099> little<00:00:32.279> bit<00:00:32.430> of

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
three-week and they had a little bit of

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.979 
three-week and they had a little bit of
time<00:00:33.500> I<00:00:34.500> probably<00:00:35.340> figured<00:00:35.790> out<00:00:35.910> pretty<00:00:36.690> easy

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
time I probably figured out pretty easy

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.440 
time I probably figured out pretty easy
so<00:00:37.800> basically<00:00:38.100> there's<00:00:38.370> four<00:00:38.700> solutions<00:00:39.030> you

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
so basically there's four solutions you

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.830 
so basically there's four solutions you
could<00:00:39.600> possibly<00:00:40.020> do<00:00:41.180> if<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.390> have<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.629> error

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
could possibly do if you have the error

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.979 
could possibly do if you have the error
message<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.410> error<00:00:43.710> message<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.989> can

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
message and that error message is can

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.150 
message and that error message is can
fix<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.590> with<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:47.030> reliable<00:00:48.379> data<00:00:49.379> connection

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
fix that with a reliable data connection

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.540 
fix that with a reliable data connection
the<00:00:50.309> server<00:00:51.590> so<00:00:52.590> first<00:00:52.920> if<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.190> want<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.430> do

for<00:03:20.510> me<00:03:20.630> basically<00:03:21.230> log<00:03:21.470> into<00:03:21.890> a<00:03:21.920> YouTube

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
and the four steps that doesn't work

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.670 
and the four steps that doesn't work
unfortunately<00:03:38.840> you<00:03:39.080> probably<00:03:39.380> would<00:03:39.500> have<00:03:39.530> to

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
unfortunately you probably would have to

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.270 
unfortunately you probably would have to
do<00:03:39.830> is<00:03:39.950> a<00:03:40.010> hard<00:03:40.190> reset<00:03:40.640> and<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:42.890> thing<00:03:43.070> is<00:03:43.160> that

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
do is a hard reset and the thing is that

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.860 
do is a hard reset and the thing is that
I<00:03:43.340> read<00:03:43.580> on<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:43.730> internet<00:03:43.820> to<00:03:44.300> like<00:03:44.540> a<00:03:44.570> lot<00:03:44.840> of
