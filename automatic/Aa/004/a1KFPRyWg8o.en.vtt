00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.839 
of everything but I don't have a 100%

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
work because that's not possible when

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.210 
work because that's not possible when
when<00:02:12.390> I<00:02:12.420> run<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.810> race<00:02:13.140> so<00:02:13.349> much<00:02:13.530> and<00:02:13.740> in<00:02:13.830> winter

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
when I run a race so much and in winter

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.809

when I do ski mountaineering sir

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.420 
when I do ski mountaineering sir

outside<00:02:19.700> when<00:02:20.239> I<00:02:20.269> was<00:02:20.450> a<00:02:20.480> kid<00:02:20.780> than<00:02:20.989> then<00:02:21.109> I

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
outside when I was a kid than then I

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.559 
outside when I was a kid than then I
when<00:02:21.439> I<00:02:21.469> needed<00:02:22.370> to<00:02:22.519> choose<00:02:22.819> University<00:02:23.120> I

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
when I needed to choose University I

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.069 
when I needed to choose University I
choose<00:02:23.959> the<00:02:24.250> choose<00:02:25.250> biology<00:02:25.879> I'm<00:02:26.780> always

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
happy when I'm be able to be out in the

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.690 
happy when I'm be able to be out in the
mountains<00:02:30.079> and<00:02:30.620> then<00:02:30.739> when<00:02:31.159> I<00:02:31.189> see<00:02:31.459> people

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
mountains and then when I see people

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.080 
mountains and then when I see people
there<00:02:32.120> it's<00:02:32.359> so<00:02:32.870> nice<00:02:33.189> it<00:02:34.189> was<00:02:34.459> good<00:02:34.819> that<00:02:34.849> it

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
there it's so nice it was good that it

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.240 
there it's so nice it was good that it
became<00:02:35.569> a<00:02:35.629> big<00:02:35.930> discussion<00:02:36.319> because<00:02:36.769> people

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
became a big discussion because people

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.099 
became a big discussion because people
need<00:02:37.430> to<00:02:37.549> realize<00:02:37.939> their<00:02:38.150> own<00:02:38.180> limits<00:02:38.720> and<00:02:38.900> if

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:39.109 
need to realize their own limits and if

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:42.009 
need to realize their own limits and if
if<00:02:39.670> normally<00:02:40.670> I'm<00:02:40.819> comfortable<00:02:41.359> going<00:02:41.659> light

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
if normally I'm comfortable going light

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.949 
if normally I'm comfortable going light
like<00:02:42.290> that<00:02:42.500> but<00:02:42.769> we<00:02:43.310> get<00:02:43.519> caught<00:02:43.760> because<00:02:43.970> the

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
like that but we get caught because the

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.440 
like that but we get caught because the
big<00:02:45.139> storm<00:02:45.470> came<00:02:45.859> much<00:02:46.579> earlier<00:02:46.819> than<00:02:47.090> we

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
big storm came much earlier than we

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.059 
big storm came much earlier than we
suspected<00:02:48.049> but<00:02:48.730> for<00:02:49.730> sure<00:02:49.879> it's<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.420> I<00:02:51.069> don't

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
suspected but for sure it's a I don't

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.399 
suspected but for sure it's a I don't
think<00:02:52.280> people<00:02:52.489> can<00:02:52.849> just<00:02:53.120> look<00:02:53.750> at<00:02:54.019> Killian

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:54.409 
think people can just look at Killian

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:55.960 
think people can just look at Killian
and<00:02:54.470> say<00:02:54.680> I<00:02:54.709> want<00:02:55.040> to<00:02:55.099> do<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.370> same<00:02:55.549> and<00:02:55.790> then

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
and say I want to do the same and then

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.220 
and say I want to do the same and then
they<00:02:56.090> do<00:02:56.150> that<00:02:56.269> because<00:02:56.569> they<00:02:56.870> need<00:02:57.079> to<00:02:57.109> be

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
they do that because they need to be

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.009 
they do that because they need to be
comfortable<00:02:57.620> with<00:02:58.069> it<00:02:58.250> so<00:02:58.549> I<00:02:58.879> think<00:02:59.720> it's<00:02:59.870> up

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
comfortable with it so I think it's up

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.679 
comfortable with it so I think it's up
to<00:03:00.049> every<00:03:01.040> person<00:03:01.250> to<00:03:01.549> decide<00:03:01.849> what<00:03:02.120> to<00:03:02.269> do<00:03:02.419> but

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:02.689 
to every person to decide what to do but

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:05.530 
to every person to decide what to do but
not<00:03:03.290> to<00:03:03.470> push<00:03:03.709> their<00:03:03.950> limits<00:03:04.099> too<00:03:04.519> far<00:03:04.790> yeah

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
not to push their limits too far yeah

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.520 
not to push their limits too far yeah
maybe<00:03:06.010> now<00:03:07.010> in<00:03:07.480> after<00:03:08.480> I<00:03:08.510> was<00:03:08.870> thinking<00:03:09.319> maybe

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
maybe now in after I was thinking maybe

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.770 
maybe now in after I was thinking maybe
I<00:03:09.709> should<00:03:09.950> have<00:03:10.159> we<00:03:10.639> could<00:03:10.909> have<00:03:11.120> repelled

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
I should have we could have repelled

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.009 
I should have we could have repelled
down<00:03:12.099> but<00:03:13.099> as<00:03:13.519> I<00:03:13.790> said<00:03:14.060> it<00:03:14.180> was<00:03:14.299> really<00:03:14.629> stormy

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
down but as I said it was really stormy

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.110 
down but as I said it was really stormy
in<00:03:15.049> windy<00:03:15.530> so<00:03:16.099> it<00:03:16.280> would<00:03:16.519> have<00:03:16.669> been<00:03:16.790> a<00:03:16.819> risk

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
in windy so it would have been a risk

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.899 
in windy so it would have been a risk
too<00:03:17.450> but<00:03:17.870> I<00:03:18.200> don't<00:03:18.470> know<00:03:18.590> as<00:03:19.099> a<00:03:19.159> normal<00:03:19.700> person

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:19.909 
too but I don't know as a normal person

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:22.839
