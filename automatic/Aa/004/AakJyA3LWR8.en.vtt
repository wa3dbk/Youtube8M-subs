00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
good part about it is that for an

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.799 
good part about it is that for an
effects<00:00:44.309> controller<00:00:44.850> it's<00:00:45.149> pretty<00:00:45.480> it's

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
effects controller it's pretty it's

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.160 
effects controller it's pretty it's
pretty<00:00:45.930> simple<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:47.280> works<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:47.940> mean<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.719> use<00:00:48.960> it

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
pretty simple it works I mean I use it

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.350 
pretty simple it works I mean I use it
on<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.440> full<00:00:49.980> night<00:00:50.219> spinning<00:00:50.850> house<00:00:51.000> music<00:00:51.539> and

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
on a full night spinning house music and

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.910 
on a full night spinning house music and
it<00:00:54.360> works<00:00:54.600> pretty<00:00:54.899> much<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.199> way<00:00:55.559> it's

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
it works pretty much the way it's

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.330 
it works pretty much the way it's
supposed<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.430> work<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:57.059> uh<00:00:57.500> it's<00:00:58.500> simple<00:00:59.100> I

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
supposed to work it uh it's simple I

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.569 
supposed to work it uh it's simple I
like<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.329> fact<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:01.289> auto<00:01:01.500> reads<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.100> BPM

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
like the fact that it auto reads the BPM

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.520 
like the fact that it auto reads the BPM
so<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:02.910> don't<00:01:03.120> have<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.329> tap<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.930> BPM<00:01:04.350> is

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
so I don't have to tap in the BPM is

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.590 
so I don't have to tap in the BPM is
each<00:01:04.650> time<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.979> want<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.939> know<00:01:06.060> quick<00:01:06.360> use

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
each time I want to you know quick use

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.140 
each time I want to you know quick use
it<00:01:06.750> because<00:01:06.869> most<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.470> time<00:01:07.970> when<00:01:08.970> I'm

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
it because most of the time when I'm

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.750 
it because most of the time when I'm
doing<00:01:09.659> effects<00:01:10.049> it's<00:01:10.470> it's<00:01:10.890> it's<00:01:11.220> on<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.520> fly

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
doing effects it's it's it's on the fly

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.390 
doing effects it's it's it's on the fly
you<00:01:12.600> know<00:01:12.720> pre<00:01:12.990> map<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.409> out<00:01:13.500> in<00:01:13.650> my<00:01:13.799> head<00:01:14.010> so

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
you know pre map it out in my head so

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.420 
you know pre map it out in my head so
you<00:01:15.390> know<00:01:15.600> this<00:01:16.259> saves<00:01:16.619> time<00:01:16.979> without<00:01:17.189> having

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
you know this saves time without having

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.969 
you know this saves time without having
to<00:01:17.610> tap<00:01:17.880> in<00:01:18.119> any<00:01:18.390> kind<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:18.990> BPM<00:01:19.549> I<00:01:21.080> like<00:01:22.080> how<00:01:22.920> the

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
to tap in any kind of BPM I like how the

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.960 
to tap in any kind of BPM I like how the
knob<00:01:23.369> for<00:01:24.350> changing<00:01:25.350> your<00:01:25.380> actual<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.640> get<00:01:26.939> a

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
knob for changing your actual you get a

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.020 
knob for changing your actual you get a
closer<00:01:27.360> look<00:01:27.479> there<00:01:27.890> the<00:01:28.890> knob<00:01:29.100> for<00:01:29.610> changing

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
closer look there the knob for changing

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.690 
closer look there the knob for changing
you<00:01:30.390> know<00:01:30.509> selecting<00:01:31.200> your<00:01:31.680> effect<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.490> like

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
you know selecting your effect I like

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.460 
you know selecting your effect I like
how<00:01:32.880> it's<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.090> exact<00:01:33.479> same<00:01:33.570> knob<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.229> exact

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
how it's the exact same knob the exact

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.340 
how it's the exact same knob the exact
same<00:01:34.650> feel<00:01:34.979> as<00:01:35.220> your<00:01:35.579> your<00:01:36.270> track<00:01:36.659> knob<00:01:36.960> for

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
same feel as your your track knob for

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.609 
same feel as your your track knob for
your<00:01:37.619> four<00:01:38.340> tracks<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:39.320> thought<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.470> was<00:01:40.590> a

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
your four tracks I thought that was a

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.850 
your four tracks I thought that was a
really<00:01:40.799> smart<00:01:41.040> idea<00:01:41.340> for<00:01:41.670> Newmark<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.479> do<00:01:42.860> I

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
really smart idea for Newmark to do I

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.789 
really smart idea for Newmark to do I
like<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:45.509> how<00:01:45.930> though<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.380> wet<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.740> dry

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
like this how though the wet and dry

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.940 
like this how though the wet and dry
fade<00:01:47.490> works<00:01:47.880> it's<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.299> nice<00:01:48.509> smooth<00:01:49.409> fader<00:01:49.680> it's

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
fade works it's a nice smooth fader it's

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.069 
fade works it's a nice smooth fader it's
not<00:01:50.189> real<00:01:50.549> buttery<00:01:50.970> like<00:01:51.299> your<00:01:51.540> cross<00:01:51.780> fader

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
not real buttery like your cross fader

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.870 
not real buttery like your cross fader
but<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.530> don't<00:01:52.710> think<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.399> would<00:01:53.520> want<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.850> to

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
but I don't think you would want it to

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.670 
but I don't think you would want it to
be<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.270> way

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
be that way

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.679 
be that way
because<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:55.860> know<00:01:55.979> you're<00:01:56.189> not<00:01:56.219> using<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.450> for

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
because you know you're not using it for

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.109 
because you know you're not using it for
cutting<00:01:58.020> or<00:01:58.290> scratching<00:01:58.829> your<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.759> know<00:01:59.880> most

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
cutting or scratching your you know most

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.200 
cutting or scratching your you know most
of<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.299> I'm<00:02:00.509> doing<00:02:00.869> nice<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.380> slow

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
of it I'm doing nice and slow

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.700 
of it I'm doing nice and slow
transitions<00:02:03.210> with<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.570> or<00:02:03.750> face<00:02:04.049> depending<00:02:04.590> on

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
transitions with it or face depending on

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.210

it<00:03:58.349> off<00:03:58.470> to<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:58.709> side<00:03:58.950> now<00:03:59.700> that<00:04:00.000> means<00:04:00.209> every

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
it off to the side now that means every

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.270 
it off to the side now that means every
time<00:04:00.690> I<00:04:00.900> go<00:04:01.230> and<00:04:01.709> DJ<00:04:02.400> I'm<00:04:02.609> gonna<00:04:02.819> have<00:04:03.030> to<00:04:03.150> undo

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
the way that this is mounted and I think

house<00:06:15.029> music<00:06:15.539> more<00:06:15.810> or<00:06:15.930> less<00:06:16.139> I<00:06:16.469> feel<00:06:17.099> like

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:17.219 
house music more or less I feel like

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:19.190 
house music more or less I feel like
you're<00:06:17.370> going<00:06:17.520> to<00:06:17.550> use<00:06:17.729> effects<00:06:18.180> than<00:06:18.779> you<00:06:18.990> are

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:19.200 
you're going to use effects than you are

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.420 
you're going to use effects than you are
in<00:06:19.500> hip-hop<00:06:19.889> so<00:06:20.520> to<00:06:20.580> speak<00:06:20.969> and

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.330 

the<00:06:23.699> the<00:06:24.300> four<00:06:24.540> that<00:06:24.690> I<00:06:24.780> use<00:06:25.020> is<00:06:25.500> the<00:06:25.530> is<00:06:26.130> the

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.340 
the the four that I use is the is the

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.360 
the the four that I use is the is the
the<00:06:26.370> phaser<00:06:27.050> the<00:06:28.050> low<00:06:28.260> pass<00:06:28.590> the<00:06:28.889> high<00:06:29.070> pass

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:29.370 
the phaser the low pass the high pass

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.620 
the phaser the low pass the high pass
the<00:06:29.910> flanger<00:06:30.540> and<00:06:31.190> echo<00:06:32.360> sometimes<00:06:33.360> I'll<00:06:33.600> use

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:33.630 
the flanger and echo sometimes I'll use

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.170 
the flanger and echo sometimes I'll use
the<00:06:34.020> delay<00:06:34.440> you<00:06:35.190> got<00:06:35.370> to<00:06:35.490> be<00:06:35.580> you<00:06:35.880> got<00:06:35.970> to<00:06:36.030> be

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 
the delay you got to be you got to be

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.670 
the delay you got to be you got to be
careful<00:06:36.449> when<00:06:36.780> you're<00:06:36.900> using<00:06:37.080> the<00:06:37.320> delay

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 
careful when you're using the delay

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.409 
careful when you're using the delay
because<00:06:38.160> if<00:06:38.340> you<00:06:38.520> don't<00:06:38.669> have<00:06:38.910> it<00:06:39.090> set<00:06:39.389> right

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:39.419 
because if you don't have it set right

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:42.200 
because if you don't have it set right
and<00:06:40.020> you<00:06:40.650> just<00:06:40.680> fade<00:06:41.190> it<00:06:41.370> in<00:06:41.520> it's<00:06:41.880> not<00:06:42.150> going

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:42.210 
and you just fade it in it's not going

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:43.730 
and you just fade it in it's not going
to<00:06:42.419> sound<00:06:42.630> good

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740 
to sound good

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.409 
to sound good
people<00:06:44.310> are<00:06:44.400> gonna<00:06:44.520> just<00:06:44.820> think<00:06:45.060> that<00:06:45.210> you're

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:45.419 
people are gonna just think that you're

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:46.850 
people are gonna just think that you're
trying<00:06:45.720> to<00:06:45.840> beat<00:06:46.050> match<00:06:46.260> a<00:06:46.410> song<00:06:46.650> and<00:06:46.800> you

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:46.860 
trying to beat match a song and you

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.590 
trying to beat match a song and you
don't<00:06:47.070> know<00:06:47.160> what<00:06:47.280> you're<00:06:47.370> doing<00:06:47.699> the<00:06:48.330> echo

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:48.600 
don't know what you're doing the echo

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.600 
don't know what you're doing the echo
works<00:06:48.870> pretty<00:06:49.229> pretty<00:06:49.770> well<00:06:50.040> if<00:06:50.220> you<00:06:50.340> do<00:06:50.490> it

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:50.610 
works pretty pretty well if you do it

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.260 
works pretty pretty well if you do it
right<00:06:50.790> but<00:06:51.630> other<00:06:51.870> than<00:06:52.020> that<00:06:52.169> I<00:06:53.060> guess<00:06:54.060> that's

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:54.270 
right but other than that I guess that's

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.830 
right but other than that I guess that's
pretty<00:06:54.449> much<00:06:54.720> it<00:06:55.280> I<00:06:56.510> was<00:06:57.510> thinking<00:06:57.780> about

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 
pretty much it I was thinking about

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.129 
pretty much it I was thinking about
doing<00:06:58.110> a<00:06:58.289> little<00:06:58.590> demo<00:06:59.370> of<00:06:59.610> how<00:07:00.600> it<00:07:00.750> worked<00:07:00.990> but

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:01.139 
doing a little demo of how it worked but

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:02.990 
doing a little demo of how it worked but
there's<00:07:01.650> other<00:07:01.800> videos<00:07:02.010> on<00:07:02.430> YouTube<00:07:02.550> about

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.000 
there's other videos on YouTube about

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.480 
there's other videos on YouTube about
that<00:07:03.389> you<00:07:03.539> can<00:07:03.720> just<00:07:03.930> watch<00:07:04.139> you<00:07:04.530> know<00:07:04.650> they

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:05.490 
that you can just watch you know they

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.520 
that you can just watch you know they
it's<00:07:06.120> pretty<00:07:06.360> much<00:07:06.539> the<00:07:06.660> same<00:07:06.840> stuff<00:07:07.169> there's

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:07.530 
it's pretty much the same stuff there's

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:12.560 
it's pretty much the same stuff there's
no<00:07:07.710> need<00:07:07.979> for<00:07:08.010> me<00:07:08.250> to<00:07:08.550> to<00:07:09.680> do<00:07:10.680> it<00:07:10.860> but<00:07:11.130> um<00:07:11.570> it's

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:12.570 
no need for me to to do it but um it's

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:15.290 
no need for me to to do it but um it's
still<00:07:12.750> solid<00:07:13.199> piece<00:07:13.560> and<00:07:13.889> I'm<00:07:14.550> happy<00:07:14.970> with<00:07:15.090> it
