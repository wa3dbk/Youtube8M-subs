as demonstrated here this is usually

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:53.800 
as demonstrated here this is usually
caused<00:01:52.340> by<00:01:52.550> a<00:01:52.700> pushing<00:01:53.119> action<00:01:53.479> which<00:01:53.660> is

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
caused by a pushing action which is

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.650 
caused by a pushing action which is
directive<00:01:54.229> too<00:01:54.470> far<00:01:54.739> behind<00:01:54.920> a<00:01:55.340> skier<00:01:55.759> the
