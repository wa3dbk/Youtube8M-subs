00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:17.580
 clash of measurements is a new strategy title for psp set in the 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:20.999
 always interesting story of the second war 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:24.159
 which has been developed entirely by the company 

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:27.159
 Spanish in the same body of action 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:33.750
 specifically the game gives us the opportunity to take the role of one of 

00:00:33.749 --> 00:00:37.519
 the seven most powerful leaders of the time that marked the aforementioned conflict 

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:42.629
 and more exactly on the side formed by the forces of the shaft we have adolf 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.449
 hitler from germany hideki tojo from japan and benito mussolini from italy while 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:53.179
 that on the Allied side will be franklin d roosevelt of united states wiston 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:57.829
 churchil of england yosef estalin of the soviet union and finally of 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:59.690
 France goal chances 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.910
 each of them having its own exclusive campaign 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.040
 therefore public and official today September 1, 1900 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.100
 39 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.800
 the internal one of the milan that reinvirá against the 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.400
 the nationalist leader 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.740
 currently informative will include in the road plan 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.500
 about the criteria that seems like a lie 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.810
 england here to france united states and the un 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.590
 war effort to prevent the imperialist expansionism of Germany 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.650
 Italy 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.630
 federica in owner of the world 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.000
 the gameplay of the title will remind us a lot of the sagas as 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.580
 total war horse since the mechanics is divided into two parts clearly 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.070
 differentiated 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.400
 management based on the turn-based strategy and the struggle being this 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.400
 last in real time 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.560
 the system is the following when starting the game we will find a map 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.630
 of the world in the form of a globe in it we can move our troops 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.820
 from one region to another with the aim of expanding at the same time that we are going 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.619
 developing our technology we expand the number of units 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.379
 we manage the economy 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.190
 espionage diplomacy 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.190
 and we improve our resources and raw materials 

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:19.699
 and not the nation that we have selected 

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:29.469
 however, once we find ourselves with an enemy army in the same 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:30.350
 territory 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.979
 we will go to the fight phase where we will dispute their control 

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:38.419
 changing then all the action to a 3d battle scenario in which 

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:41.919
 command we have our units directly as we would in 

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:44.539
 any real-time strategy game 

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:48.199
 although having added elements of great realism such as having to 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:51.749
 worry about details like the ammunition of the troops or the fuel 

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:54.749
 of the vehicles 

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:05.139
 likewise the whole game has a very high historical fidelity so 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:08.899
 that the different units have the same capabilities and limitations that 

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:10.729
 those of their real analogs 

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:13.840
 and in the same way the course of events 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.700
 will also follow the storyline of the war but in this case with the 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.580
 except to choose between three levels of historical rigor according to 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.449
 we want an experience closer to reality 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:28.079
 or be ourselves to set a new course for our nation 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.099
 being able in this case to get to see new alliances or plot twists 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.099
 totally unexpected 

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:36.829
 He explained that the war 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:40.069
 with the participation of important brands of tanks 

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:43.779
 and is vulnerable to infantry 

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:45.899
 in their confrontation 

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:49.219
 you can only have anti-tank caribs 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:50.549
 effectively results 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.129
 which seriously impairs their mobility 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:56.959
 and whose quantity of living many times insufficient before groups of cars that 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:58.569
 it was suppressed 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.859
 this way, the possibility of anti-tank weapons was raised 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:07.060
 graphically the title has pleasantly surprised us because of its high level 

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:08.089
 quality 

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:11.639
 since although in the management part everything is developed somewhat 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:16.219
 schematic in the fights in real time we will see some battle scenarios 

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:19.749
 of quite spectacular being possible to take advantage of the 

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:23.740
 characteristics of the terrain itself today even of the different effects 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.129
 climatic and what is better now 

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:29.779
 the game also boasts a perfect modeling of all units 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:33.800
 something that we will not be especially when we bring the camera closer 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.099
 place it just a few inches above it 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.719
 our potential webó 

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:53.520
 and lastly in addition to its extensive and very rejugable campaign mode 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.789
 the title allows us to participate in two modes plus a battle mode 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:00.770
 fast where we can go directly to the action 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.770
 configuring all the parameters to our liking 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:08.379
 playing online in which we will be given the option to play in campaign mode to 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:13.499
 a fast battle with up to a maximum of seven players taking each user 

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:16.499
 control of one of the margins available in it 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:29.750
 it's a title that has hit stores without making too much noise but 

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:33.259
 if it can be placed on its own merits thanks to its high depth 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:37.610
 and great technical section as one of the best hybrid strategy games 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.900
 most recommended at the moment 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.810
 being the only negative point that we can blame 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.029
 its maybe something low optimization 

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:48.589
 since to play with him with everything to the maximum we will need 

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:51.589
 a good team of medial jama 

00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:59.930
 both leaders clasos measurement is counted on all the texts and 2 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.020
 completely translated 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.240
 despite the Castilian 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.849
 already being sold to nesv 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:04.509
 the sport always
