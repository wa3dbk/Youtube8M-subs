00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
for the wii u just because you're not a

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.000

separate screen on your gamepad that
doesn't<00:03:51.530> mean<00:03:51.590> it's<00:03:51.650> a<00:03:51.860> bad<00:03:51.890> system<00:03:52.520> I<00:03:52.760> mean<00:03:53.030> I

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
doesn't mean it's a bad system I mean I

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:54.910 
doesn't mean it's a bad system I mean I
think<00:03:53.240> it's<00:03:53.510> selling<00:03:53.810> pretty<00:03:54.020> well<00:03:54.200> it<00:03:54.890> just

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
think it's selling pretty well it just

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.190 
think it's selling pretty well it just
comes<00:03:55.250> down<00:03:55.310> to<00:03:55.459> opinion<00:03:56.030> and<00:03:56.240> whether<00:03:57.080> that

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
comes down to opinion and whether that

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.020 
comes down to opinion and whether that
opinion<00:03:57.740> really<00:03:57.920> matters<00:03:58.040> at<00:03:58.490> the<00:03:58.700> end<00:03:58.730> of<00:03:58.970> the

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
opinion really matters at the end of the

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.670 
opinion really matters at the end of the
day<00:03:59.180> alright<00:03:59.660> so<00:03:59.810> obviously<00:04:00.170> I<00:04:00.260> say<00:04:00.440> that<00:04:00.560> with
