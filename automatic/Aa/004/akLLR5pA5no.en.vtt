00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.180
 hello youtube friends today I bring you 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.460
 here a very interesting thing that I have 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.590
 found out there investigating about the 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.360
 minecraft as you know I miss myself very much 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.300
 often my survival guides in addition 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.160
 I've been looking 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.800
 and I found that there is this 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.170
 gadget called víctor that is like that 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.300
 as a meeting point besides that as 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.880
 you see a laser pit that is the sky 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.750
 which is seen from far away and serves as 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.550
 for apart from delimiting an area 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.730
 allows to make enchantments in that area 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.400
 it's as if we say an artifact that I 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:40.150
 I know the magic power 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:43.870
 you see has three levels 1 2 and 3 that you 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.790
 speak different types of magic the 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.030
 magics have a limited scope is 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:52.060
 say if you separate much from the vigor then 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.370
 loses its effect, it also regenerates 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.410
 life but to use all of these 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.170
 skills you have to pay one of 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.600
 these things 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.420
 it now I'll explain how 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.840
 do this 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.810
 to make a vigor as you see here I would 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.090
 I have put here already but because I am 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.740
 with creative mode you need 5 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.579
 crystals 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.060
 32 iliana and a star of neder is worth 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:23.070
 let's make an example 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:26.480
 they are 32 and targets 1 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.480
 let's get into creative mode 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.690
 32 and we already come here block of the 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.690
 yes, target 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.710
 5 crystals 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:45.190
 block of crystals 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.320
 go through our 64 diamonds and one 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.700
 star of neder vale let's go to 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.560
 build it right now we put 3 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.869
 big star in the middle and 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.930
 crystals is worth as we already have a 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:01.240
 beat with built you'll ask me 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.070
 how the star of lider is taken out 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.280
 in the star and leader is very peculiar 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:10.989
 to make it because you need to take out 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.550
 to the widder you need to invoke the 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.470
 widder 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.260
 twitter is a very strong niche that there 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.269
 that kill him good good and that exploits 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.480
 he throws things and to embroil what is 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.190
 you need earth of souls or sand of 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.950
 souls 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.660
 perform this construction 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.690
 as it is, it is like a 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.879
 little person we wear the head of we 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.060
 skeleton there of we there are put 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:39.629
 three and here you have the mouth this I saw 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.930
 Chaco that must be topped up first 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:46.530
 air life when recharge explodes 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.530
 we go 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.260
 and now we have to look for it 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.140
 because this one is loading everything 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:58.450
 pilla be used here so others 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.450
 you have to kill him he has a lot of life 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.280
 it is necessary for him 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:23.239
 ok it's fallen and there's fall I'm here 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.350
 you have not fucked the good vico we already have 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:28.170
 the 39 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.570
 of the leader but it's worth it now we're going to 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.280
 manufacture since we have tightened the 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:36.090
 bimester 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.580
 you do not have to wait long 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.530
 this diamond is missing but it remains 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.310
 more beautiful and step we will do the 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.310
 largest pyramid 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.609
 we'll see 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.370
 to give us enchantments of level 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.370
 two 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.600
 It can also be iron what you put 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.910
 at the base 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.120
 It does not matter if it looks more beautiful 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.120
 bacon 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.970
 and there it is 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.580
 As you can see I'm going to take it for my ass 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.489
 because it illuminates the host and above it looks 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:19.670
 the lightning sends güevos the ray is seen 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:22.239
 knows where it is very useful to find 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.239
 the position 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.510
 and now I'm going to explain to you about the 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.560
 enchantments for it is worth as you have 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.900
 seen now will have unlock the 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.110
 enchantments of level 2 effectively 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.420
 because I need something to pay so 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:39.139
 let's use this we're going to spend myself 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:41.710
 I know rough diamonds 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:46.280
 where are rough diamonds 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:49.990
 Diamond diamond material 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.990
 we're going to spend rough diamonds 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.100
 let's see it let's unblock by 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.700
 example speed 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.700
 OK 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:02.900
 It is activated 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.810
 As you can see we have the pits 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.590
 recharge is not lost it would be followed 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.590
 having here speed 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.950
 will continue to have speed this has a 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.690
 scope is going recharging but there comes a 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:19.120
 moment in which you already lose what is 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:21.850
 the adaptation zone of that for example 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.590
 here already and you lose the speed like that 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.170
 all enchantments is to say is very 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.350
 useful both to have your position as 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.940
 for enchantments and others and good 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:33.370
 so far the first video tutorial that 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.230
 I do it is very nice the truth I will make a 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.570
 couple of these 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:41.550
 in my survival site to delimit 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.550
 the area and that thanks for watching and goodbye
