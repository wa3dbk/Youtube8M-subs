00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
great one from Belkin this is the live

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.820 
great one from Belkin this is the live
action<00:02:09.060> remote<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:10.110> this<00:02:10.319> is<00:02:10.440> how<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:10.649> works

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
action remote and this is how it works

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.290 
action remote and this is how it works
first<00:02:11.099> you<00:02:11.250> take<00:02:11.430> it<00:02:11.550> apart<00:02:11.790> boom

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
first you take it apart boom

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.030 
first you take it apart boom
I<00:02:13.330> love<00:02:13.780> you<00:02:13.840> there's<00:02:14.290> your<00:02:14.380> bill<00:02:14.590> if<00:02:14.740> that<00:02:14.890> was

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
I love you there's your bill if that was

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.130 
I love you there's your bill if that was
boom<00:02:15.250> would<00:02:15.570> know<00:02:16.570> it's<00:02:16.720> blue<00:02:16.870> more<00:02:17.110> than

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
boom would know it's blue more than

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.640 
boom would know it's blue more than
skeptic<00:02:21.300> so<00:02:22.300> basically<00:02:22.600> you<00:02:22.870> spit<00:02:23.290> it<00:02:23.380> on<00:02:23.440> like

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
skeptic so basically you spit it on like

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.350 
skeptic so basically you spit it on like
this<00:02:23.770> and<00:02:23.830> it's<00:02:24.130> also<00:02:24.280> case<00:02:24.640> compatible<00:02:25.180> and

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
this and it's also case compatible and

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
then you can basically sit it down on to

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.640 
then you can basically sit it down on to
a<00:02:27.640> table<00:02:28.060> right<00:02:28.570> now<00:02:28.960> it's<00:02:29.200> gonna<00:02:29.350> use<00:02:29.530> your
