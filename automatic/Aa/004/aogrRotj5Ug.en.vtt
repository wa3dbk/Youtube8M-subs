small medium and large and extra-large

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.360 
small medium and large and extra-large
that's<00:00:42.750> correct<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.260> backs<00:00:43.680> can<00:00:43.980> be<00:00:44.160> fitted

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
that's correct that backs can be fitted

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.369 
that's correct that backs can be fitted
to<00:00:44.489> different<00:00:44.879> size<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.390> say<00:00:45.600> you're<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.930> runner

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
to different size so say you're a runner

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.470

or<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.649> bodybuilder<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.460> kneecap<00:00:47.879> actually<00:00:48.390> is

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
or a bodybuilder the kneecap actually is

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.630 
or a bodybuilder the kneecap actually is
what<00:00:48.660> we<00:00:48.780> fit<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.289> then<00:00:49.410> we<00:00:49.590> can<00:00:49.829> basically

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
what we fit and then we can basically

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.270 
what we fit and then we can basically
sort<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.120> customize<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.809> for<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.280> depending

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
important thing they're all made out of

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.650 
important thing they're all made out of
carbon<00:00:59.399> fiber<00:00:59.760> and<00:00:59.910> we're<00:01:00.149> also<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.629> only

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
carbon fiber and we're also the only

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.630 
carbon fiber and we're also the only
brace<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.260> has<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.440> ball<00:01:01.770> hinge<00:01:02.129> instead<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.579> a

flat<00:01:02.789> fixed<00:01:03.180> hinge<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:04.020> helps<00:01:04.410> to<00:01:04.500> keep

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
flat fixed hinge and this helps to keep

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.039 
flat fixed hinge and this helps to keep
you<00:01:04.979> moving<00:01:05.250> against<00:01:06.150> your<00:01:06.270> natural<00:01:06.420> muscles

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
anti-rotation tether we have

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:05.480 
anti-rotation tether we have
small/medium<00:02:04.229> is<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.890> same<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.369> then<00:02:05.460> we

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
small/medium is the same and then we

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.190 
small/medium is the same and then we
have<00:02:05.729> large<00:02:06.030> extra-large<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:06.810> they<00:02:06.929> can<00:02:07.109> go

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200

it can can it get a little bit bigger I

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.250 
it can can it get a little bit bigger I

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
but the knee seems to expand when

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:32.990 
but the knee seems to expand when
they're<00:02:31.860> little<00:02:32.130> when<00:02:32.340> you're<00:02:32.430> an<00:02:32.549> adult<00:02:32.670> they
