life without a doubt the charging is a
lot<00:01:25.170> lot<00:01:25.979> slower

with the longer charging times in my
experience<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.399> a<00:01:35.429> very<00:01:35.729> negative<00:01:36.030> point

00:01:36.589 --> 00:01:36.599 
experience that is a very negative point

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:38.749 
experience that is a very negative point
they<00:01:36.780> should<00:01:36.990> have<00:01:37.080> worked<00:01:37.830> something<00:01:38.220> out<00:01:38.489> so

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
they should have worked something out so

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.690 
they should have worked something out so
at<00:01:38.910> least<00:01:39.060> charged<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.840> reasonable<00:01:40.349> rate<00:01:40.700> also

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
I found it mainly along these two sides

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.059 
I found it mainly along these two sides
here<00:01:50.700> on<00:01:50.849> the<00:01:51.390> front<00:01:51.660> and<00:01:51.929> the<00:01:52.080> back<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.830> does

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:53.069 
here on the front and the back it does

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:55.040 
here on the front and the back it does
get<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.340> little<00:01:53.610> bit<00:01:53.759> warmer<00:01:54.149> but<00:01:54.630> it's<00:01:54.810> not<00:01:55.020> a

get a little bit warmer but it's not a
deal-breaker<00:01:55.340> it<00:01:56.340> mainly<00:01:56.670> happens<00:01:56.940> if<00:01:57.239> you're

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
deal-breaker it mainly happens if you're

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.020 
deal-breaker it mainly happens if you're
running<00:01:57.750> things<00:01:57.929> at<00:01:58.170> full<00:01:58.410> brightness<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:59.190> lot

is extremely good the performance on

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.750 
is extremely good the performance on
this<00:02:16.319> is<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.800> same<00:02:17.040> as<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.310> previous

on this new generation iPad the iPad 2
will<00:02:35.709> probably<00:02:36.010> still<00:02:36.250> run<00:02:36.519> them<00:02:36.730> at<00:02:36.849> a

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:36.909 
will probably still run them at a

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.149 
will probably still run them at a
downscaled<00:02:37.540> resolution<00:02:38.260> but<00:02:38.829> it<00:02:38.920> won't

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:39.159 
downscaled resolution but it won't

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.280 
downscaled resolution but it won't
perform<00:02:39.519> quite<00:02:39.879> as<00:02:40.090> well<00:02:40.299> when<00:02:40.780> running<00:02:41.049> those
