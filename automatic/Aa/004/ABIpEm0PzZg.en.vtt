have<00:01:20.850> billions<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.570> dollars<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:22.140> think<00:01:22.320> like

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
have billions of dollars I think like

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.440 
have billions of dollars I think like
two<00:01:22.680> billion<00:01:22.920> dollars<00:01:23.400> for<00:01:23.759> each<00:01:23.880> character

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
two billion dollars for each character

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.390 
two billion dollars for each character
so<00:01:24.780> you're<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.799> have<00:01:25.920> more<00:01:26.159> than<00:01:26.280> enough
