basic hand tools the head on taking the
valves<00:00:13.830> out<00:00:13.950> is<00:00:14.219> for<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.610> diesel<00:00:15.120> engine<00:00:15.540> it's<00:00:16.139> a

Perkins 4-cylinder 236 cubic inch fairly
often<00:00:25.109> there<00:00:25.289> you've<00:00:25.470> got<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.800> get<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.039> valve

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
often there you've got to get the valve

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.550 
often there you've got to get the valve
spring<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.300> compressor<00:00:27.949> to<00:00:29.150> do<00:00:30.150> this<00:00:30.420> job<00:00:30.720> but

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
spring and compressor to do this job but

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.010 
spring and compressor to do this job but
actually<00:00:32.160> sometimes<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.510> can<00:00:33.630> do<00:00:33.719> with<00:00:33.870> just

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
actually sometimes you can do with just

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.350 
actually sometimes you can do with just
basic<00:00:34.500> hand<00:00:34.710> tools<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.100> what<00:00:36.000> I'm<00:00:36.090> going<00:00:36.300> to

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
basic hand tools and what I'm going to

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.280 
basic hand tools and what I'm going to
show<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:36.570> today<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.140> how<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:38.100> do<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.610> with

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
show you today is how to do it with

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:46.450 
show you today is how to do it with
something<00:00:40.290> as<00:00:40.620> simple<00:00:40.649> as<00:00:42.079> deep<00:00:43.079> Salkin<00:00:44.120> and<00:00:45.120> a

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
something as simple as deep Salkin and a

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.029 
something as simple as deep Salkin and a
hammer<00:00:47.660> now<00:00:48.660> there<00:00:48.899> be<00:00:49.079> those<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.860> who've

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
hammer now there be those of you who've

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.010 
hammer now there be those of you who've
seen<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:50.489> done<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.090> who've<00:00:51.660> done<00:00:51.840> it

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
seen this done and who've done it

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.560 
seen this done and who've done it
yourselves<00:00:52.610> but<00:00:53.610> for<00:00:53.879> those<00:00:53.969> who<00:00:54.239> haven't

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
yourselves but for those who haven't

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.270 
yourselves but for those who haven't
it's<00:00:55.350> actually<00:00:55.800> not<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.309> bad<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.940> process

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
it's actually not that bad of a process

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.450 
it's actually not that bad of a process
it<00:00:59.280> just<00:00:59.340> requires<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.320> decent<00:01:01.320> forceful<00:01:02.100> smack

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
it just requires a decent forceful smack

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.410 
it just requires a decent forceful smack
and<00:01:02.820> proper<00:01:03.660> placement<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.530> socket

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
and proper placement of the socket

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.500 
and proper placement of the socket
placement<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.600> socket<00:01:07.340> essentially<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.520> big

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
placement the socket essentially is big

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.380 
placement the socket essentially is big
enough<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.380> valve<00:01:10.560> stem<00:01:11.240> can<00:01:12.240> go

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
enough so that the valve stem can go

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.710 
enough so that the valve stem can go
through<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:13.500> put<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:14.360> roughly<00:01:15.360> centered

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
through it you put it roughly centered

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.560 
through it you put it roughly centered
on<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:17.450> on<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:19.170> retainer<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:20.210> you<00:01:21.210> get<00:01:21.360> ready

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
on the on the retainer and you get ready

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.899 
on the on the retainer and you get ready
to<00:01:21.780> give<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.080> good<00:01:22.200> snack<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:23.369> will<00:01:23.549> have<00:01:23.759> to

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
to give it a good snack you will have to

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.219 
to give it a good snack you will have to
hold<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.390> but<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.320> doable<00:01:27.080> hopefully<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.110> can

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
hold it but it is doable hopefully I can

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.319 
hold it but it is doable hopefully I can
get<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.590> set<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.040> good<00:01:29.250> angle<00:01:29.460> here<00:01:29.970> and

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
get you set to a good angle here and

00:01:30.329 --> 00:02:10.449 
get you set to a good angle here and
also<00:01:31.049> you

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.520 

and<00:02:11.000> that<00:02:11.180> is<00:02:11.360> how<00:02:11.680> you<00:02:12.680> take<00:02:12.950> belfs<00:02:14.530> Springs

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
and that is how you take belfs Springs

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.179 
and that is how you take belfs Springs
retainers<00:02:16.519> and<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:17.209> clips<00:02:17.480> off<00:02:18.159> with<00:02:19.159> a

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:19.189 
retainers and the clips off with a

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:22.809 
retainers and the clips off with a
simple<00:02:19.459> bitter<00:02:19.879> of<00:02:20.349> smacking<00:02:21.430> with<00:02:22.430> a<00:02:22.459> hammer

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
simple bitter of smacking with a hammer

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.640 
simple bitter of smacking with a hammer
and<00:02:23.439> decent<00:02:24.439> size<00:02:24.680> and<00:02:25.159> deep<00:02:25.310> socket<00:02:26.470> as<00:02:27.470> you

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
and decent size and deep socket as you

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.899 
and decent size and deep socket as you
can<00:02:27.799> see<00:02:28.010> they<00:02:28.280> do<00:02:28.670> come<00:02:28.849> off<00:02:29.170> relatively<00:02:30.170> easy

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:30.909 
can see they do come off relatively easy

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:33.339 
can see they do come off relatively easy
it's<00:02:31.909> just<00:02:32.120> a<00:02:32.239> little<00:02:32.480> bit<00:02:32.569> of<00:02:32.659> smacking<00:02:33.140> and

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
it's just a little bit of smacking and

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:34.690 
it's just a little bit of smacking and
you<00:02:33.739> have<00:02:33.829> to<00:02:33.950> be<00:02:34.040> careful<00:02:34.340> you<00:02:34.370> don't<00:02:34.459> hit

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
you have to be careful you don't hit

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.899 
you have to be careful you don't hit
your<00:02:34.819> fingers<00:02:35.150> because<00:02:35.450> that<00:02:35.930> will<00:02:36.170> hurt<00:02:36.909> next

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:37.909 
your fingers because that will hurt next

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:39.910 
your fingers because that will hurt next
video<00:02:38.239> we'll<00:02:38.750> be<00:02:38.780> showing<00:02:39.079> you<00:02:39.500> how<00:02:39.680> to<00:02:39.739> put

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
video we'll be showing you how to put

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.849 
video we'll be showing you how to put
them<00:02:40.099> back<00:02:40.519> together
