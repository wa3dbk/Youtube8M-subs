00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 first of all the choice of wood following this 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.620
 we want leather in space for example a 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.389
 three minutes cooking time this is 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.500
 pretty much it's waiting for them that they are 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.290
 a quarter of an hour of merguez 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.000
 that's something longer than 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.410
 Harbor 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.150
 go we have almost half an hour of 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.140
 true of the ecsa and then if we want to do 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.980
 a barbecue beef 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.119
 we do not hesitate step number 2 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.470
 log making and a touch well 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.560
 sure jeanne type of arc which I am 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.269
 recalls the motto she said about on 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.470
 his pyre prefer you do not have me 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.420
 raw or poorly cooked 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.469
 it is therefore the patron saint of 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:48.230
 barbecues so firstly we constitute 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:53.760
 a base here we cross sports wood 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:55.590
 to ensure good ventilation and we have 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.250
 of course leave a small place or 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:05.129
 under to allow to place paper 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:08.180
 ignited to start the fire there we are 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.180
 absolutely in real time 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.930
 Of course, we have to take 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.900
 pieces of pruned wood at his 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.119
 neighbors to avoid that later 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.330
 some wood is not burned then 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:28.470
 that others have already passed in brest 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.470
 already spent in ashes 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.420
 obviously the wood we used 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:51.340
 authentic apple wood 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:56.110
 of course the apple was removed to 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:02:01.000
 veil for some third merguez 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:03.220
 step fire one must think that before 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.539
 fire alone the wood will be in 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.080
 bresse in the five minutes that go 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:08.170
 to follow 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:12.310
 and if we are not ready to grill 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:15.000
 right now it comes favorite it wants 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.579
 to say that goes the bresse will be in ashes 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.060
 before we are decided to do so 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:25.630
 I thought you five minutes after the 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.530
 firing and links of the brede 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.530
 so let's go 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.769
 must of course strong is that the support 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.660
 who is in front of you you are bigger than 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:56.920
 foot support so that the fire does not 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:59.730
 do not collapse by the voice on 100 it's 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.730
 a race that I assure you 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:09.239
 after I try to get caught in 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:14.250
 all its width at the same time so that 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.250
 the blaze its total of the desert 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:24.250
 here we go in a few minutes 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.910
 it will be breizh 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:41.220
 the combustion is all the better than 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.220
 the call of air below is consequent 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.130
 men and women 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:05.750
 obviously after it takes something 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:14.410
 to finish cleaning agricultural this is what 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:18.320
 of which a blur nearby amazing not 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.940
 so when it's over to burn wants 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.200
 bring back the breeze and if you want 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:26.780
 a little ram fire behind he can 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:30.560
 put the pieces that continue to 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:33.370
 flambÃ© we can put them in reserve or 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:39.350
 worked from the square 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:42.100
 this is ready we can put the 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.100
 disappointed merguez
