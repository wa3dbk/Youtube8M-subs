this<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.620> bit<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:35.010> shorter<00:00:35.370> review<00:00:35.760> than

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
this is a bit of a shorter review than

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.639 
this is a bit of a shorter review than
what<00:00:36.090> we<00:00:36.210> probably<00:00:36.450> normally<00:00:36.899> will<00:00:37.020> do<00:00:37.200> there

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
what we probably normally will do there

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:38.959 
what we probably normally will do there
really<00:00:37.739> isn't<00:00:37.920> too<00:00:38.070> much<00:00:38.160> substance<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.850> this

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
really isn't too much substance to this

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.720 
really isn't too much substance to this
substance<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:39.840> game<00:00:40.129> the<00:00:41.129> gist<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.520> is

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
substance to this game the gist of it is

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.959 
substance to this game the gist of it is
you're<00:00:42.660> an<00:00:42.780> RC<00:00:43.140> car<00:00:43.170> driving<00:00:43.860> around<00:00:44.010> there's

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
you're an RC car driving around there's

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.760 
you're an RC car driving around there's
very<00:00:45.239> limited<00:00:45.390> options<00:00:45.930> here<00:00:46.260> you've

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
very limited options here you've

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.740 
very limited options here you've
probably<00:00:46.920> already<00:00:47.129> seen<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.550> screen<00:00:47.879> there

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
probably already seen that screen there

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.690 
probably already seen that screen there
is<00:00:49.050> very<00:00:49.260> limited<00:00:49.410> control<00:00:49.800> options<00:00:50.309> here<00:00:50.579> I

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
is very limited control options here I

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.549 
is very limited control options here I
had<00:00:50.850> my<00:00:50.969> 360<00:00:51.420> controller<00:00:51.930> hooked<00:00:52.289> up

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
had my 360 controller hooked up

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.189 
had my 360 controller hooked up
expecting<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.550> work<00:00:53.579> there<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.539> an<00:00:54.780> option

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
expecting it to work there is an option

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.220 
expecting it to work there is an option
to<00:00:55.230> use<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.500> PlayStation<00:00:56.340> 3<00:00:56.610> controller<00:00:57.059> but<00:00:58.020> as

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
to use a PlayStation 3 controller but as

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.360 
to use a PlayStation 3 controller but as
I<00:00:58.410> don't<00:00:58.649> have<00:00:58.890> one

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
I don't have one

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.220 
I don't have one
I<00:00:59.399> figured<00:00:59.969> hey<00:01:00.239> maybe<00:01:00.750> it'll<00:01:00.930> still<00:01:01.199> work

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
I figured hey maybe it'll still work

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.860 
I figured hey maybe it'll still work
with<00:01:01.500> my<00:01:01.590> 360<00:01:02.129> one<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.489> did<00:01:02.699> not<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.690> had<00:01:03.809> to

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
with my 360 one it did not so I had to

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.179 
with my 360 one it did not so I had to
use<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.110> keyboard<00:01:04.439> for<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.710> entire<00:01:04.949> duration

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
use the keyboard for the entire duration

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.450 
use the keyboard for the entire duration
uh

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
uh

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.969 
uh
this<00:01:08.460> plays<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.729> bit<00:01:09.060> like<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.950> revamped<00:01:10.950> version

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
this plays a bit like a revamped version

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.310 
this plays a bit like a revamped version
of<00:01:11.700> micromachines<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.780> might<00:01:12.930> remember<00:01:13.049> that

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
of micromachines you might remember that

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.890 
of micromachines you might remember that
from<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.560> old<00:01:13.680> NES<00:01:14.070> days<00:01:14.420> great<00:01:15.420> game<00:01:15.659> by<00:01:15.840> the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
from the old NES days great game by the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.010 
from the old NES days great game by the
way<00:01:15.990> this<00:01:16.500> one<00:01:16.710> not<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.159> much

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
way this one not so much

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.380 
way this one not so much
it's<00:01:19.020> very<00:01:19.259> simplistic<00:01:19.650> very<00:01:20.280> plain<00:01:20.549> not<00:01:21.360> a

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
it's very simplistic very plain not a

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.149 
it's very simplistic very plain not a
whole<00:01:21.659> lot<00:01:21.840> going<00:01:21.869> on<00:01:22.200> eases<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.860> there's<00:01:23.100> a

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
whole lot going on eases it there's a

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.310 
whole lot going on eases it there's a
lot<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.520> attempts<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.509> do<00:01:24.659> things<00:01:25.020> in<00:01:25.229> the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
lot of attempts to do things in the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.740 
lot of attempts to do things in the
levels<00:01:25.650> you'll<00:01:26.340> have<00:01:26.520> frogs<00:01:27.090> leaping<00:01:27.540> around

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
levels you'll have frogs leaping around

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.230 
levels you'll have frogs leaping around
the<00:01:27.840> track<00:01:28.170> people<00:01:28.740> walking<00:01:29.100> around<00:01:29.430> like<00:01:30.119> I

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
the track people walking around like I

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.330 
the track people walking around like I
say<00:01:30.420> you're<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.689> size<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.140> RC<00:01:31.560> car<00:01:31.590> so

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
say you're the size of the RC car so

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.940 
say you're the size of the RC car so
it's<00:01:32.670> kind<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:32.939> everything's<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:34.290> bigand

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
it's kind of everything's and bigand

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.310 
it's kind of everything's and bigand
yeah<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:35.759> use<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.329> word<00:01:36.479> get<00:01:37.110> used<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:38.210> so

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
yeah I use that word get used to it so

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.380 
yeah I use that word get used to it so
it's<00:01:40.320> not<00:01:40.560> bad<00:01:40.829> but<00:01:41.460> it's<00:01:41.610> not<00:01:41.700> great<00:01:42.000> either

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
it's not bad but it's not great either

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.560 
it's not bad but it's not great either
it<00:01:43.200> has<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.470> stunt<00:01:44.189> system<00:01:44.729> which<00:01:44.939> replenishes

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
it has a stunt system which replenishes

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.380 
it has a stunt system which replenishes
your<00:01:45.600> nitrous<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.820> it's<00:01:47.820> very<00:01:48.119> simplistic

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
your nitrous and it's very simplistic

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.270 
your nitrous and it's very simplistic

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
you hit a ramp you hit a space bar to

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.850 
you hit a ramp you hit a space bar to
jump<00:01:50.549> or<00:01:50.790> ship<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.329> boost<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.899> space<00:01:52.350> for<00:01:52.530> jump

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
jump or ship to boost and space for jump

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.310 
jump or ship to boost and space for jump
and<00:01:53.070> combine<00:01:53.369> them<00:01:53.549> for<00:01:53.579> some<00:01:53.790> crazy<00:01:54.420> air<00:01:54.780> whoa
