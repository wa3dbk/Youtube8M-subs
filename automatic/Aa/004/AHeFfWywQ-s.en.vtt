00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.330 
fitted it was all ready all in the right
places<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:12.290> maybe<00:01:13.290> them<00:01:13.619> with<00:01:13.860> more<00:01:14.070> nicer

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340

position the last year it just fits a
bit<00:01:16.590> more<00:01:16.770> spacious<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.689> way<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:18.990> was

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
bit more spacious and in that way it was

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.800 
bit more spacious and in that way it was
was<00:01:19.560> nice<00:01:19.830> but<00:01:20.159> it's<00:01:20.640> also<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.240> same<00:01:21.420> story

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
was nice but it's also the same story

there might be small things we have to

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.200 
there might be small things we have to
change<00:01:26.729> afterwards<00:01:27.210> but<00:01:27.860> all<00:01:29.180> under<00:01:30.180> control

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210

integrated<00:01:43.320> with<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.439> team<00:01:44.210> I<00:01:45.210> think<00:01:46.020> we

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
integrated with the team I think we

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.899 
integrated with the team I think we
learn<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.439> lot<00:01:46.710> from<00:01:46.770> last<00:01:47.189> year<00:01:47.520> with<00:01:47.820> the

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
learn a lot from last year with the

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.789 
learn a lot from last year with the
difficulties<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.600> we<00:01:48.810> had<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.380> obviously

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
difficulties that we had and obviously

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.580 
difficulties that we had and obviously
we<00:01:49.979> had<00:01:50.100> some<00:01:50.310> bad<00:01:50.490> luck<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.939> for<00:01:51.240> Isis<00:01:51.570> but<00:01:51.750> you

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
we had some bad luck on for Isis but you

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.350 
we had some bad luck on for Isis but you
know<00:01:52.770> sometimes<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.369> have<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.820> years<00:01:54.090> and

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
know sometimes you have the years and

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.109 
know sometimes you have the years and
goes<00:01:54.990> like<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.439> everything<00:01:56.009> just<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.909> go<00:01:57.090> a

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
goes like that everything just to go a

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.819 
goes like that everything just to go a
bit<00:01:57.360> or<00:01:57.990> be<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.560> bit<00:01:58.829> difficult<00:01:59.070> than<00:01:59.549> and<00:02:00.829> we

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
bit or be a bit difficult than and we

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.679 
bit or be a bit difficult than and we
understood<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.369> lot<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.850> things<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.420> hopefully

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
understood a lot of things and hopefully

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.959 
understood a lot of things and hopefully
this<00:02:04.079> year<00:02:04.320> we<00:02:04.590> can<00:02:04.740> turn<00:02:04.979> things<00:02:05.219> around<00:02:05.460> and

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
this year we can turn things around and

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.130 
this year we can turn things around and

team with two cars due to push things

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.310 
team with two cars due to push things
forward<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.400> keep<00:02:35.670> keep<00:02:36.480> building<00:02:36.750> what<00:02:37.110> will

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
forward and keep keep building what will

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.260 
forward and keep keep building what will
be<00:02:37.470> building<00:02:37.890> over<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.280> over<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.730> winter<00:02:39.240> and

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
be building over the over the winter and

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.660 
be building over the over the winter and
go<00:02:39.930> from<00:02:40.110> there<00:02:40.380> I<00:02:40.440> think<00:02:40.590> that's<00:02:41.520> the

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
go from there I think that's the

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.850 
go from there I think that's the
starting<00:02:42.120> point<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.660> then<00:02:42.870> obviously<00:02:43.170> the

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
starting point and then obviously the

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.970 
starting point and then obviously the
results<00:02:44.340> should<00:02:44.459> come<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:45.590> there's<00:02:46.590> no<00:02:46.740> point

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
results should come and there's no point

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.949 
results should come and there's no point
at<00:02:47.280> least<00:02:47.520> on<00:02:47.700> my<00:02:47.850> side<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.300> boot<00:02:48.480> any<00:02:48.660> goals

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
at least on my side to boot any goals

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.440 
at least on my side to boot any goals
yet<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:49.530> they<00:02:50.310> start<00:02:50.640> from<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.970> first<00:02:51.120> test

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
yet and they start from the first test

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.449 
yet and they start from the first test
and<00:02:51.690> go<00:02:51.810> forward<00:02:52.170> from<00:02:52.350> there<00:02:52.739> and<00:02:53.040> see<00:02:53.250> what

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
and go forward from there and see what

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.540 
and go forward from there and see what
we<00:02:53.610> have<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:54.260> probably<00:02:55.260> where<00:02:55.860> we<00:02:55.980> are<00:02:56.130> at
