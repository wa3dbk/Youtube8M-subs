00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.950
 and this is a beautiful joke of this brand new 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.000
 video today we are here with a pc 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.610
 quite dated yes 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.790
 today I will show you how it will enhance this 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.790
 pc 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:18.750
 first let's see what mounts 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:23.550
 2gb of ram a lot of intel core 2 processor 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:26.640
 quad core q8200 then much envy 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.990
 sees and acts passively yes 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.660
 used these cards saw one 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:35.010
 time and now there are super 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.380
 cool er dual shit several a 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.920
 really ugly feeder of the 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.210
 guys if the thunder comes not just you 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.079
 will destroy power supply but is destroyed 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.480
 all 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.079
 an asus motherboard which is enough 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.910
 decent is a must horde a land in which 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.829
 there is the operating system is everything and 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.480
 so let's forget it 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.829
 we're going to mount an ssd and ram 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.940
 precisely we will go to mount an ssd from 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:06.000
 120 gb and 4 gb of ram and for how much 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.340
 concerns the kers has not completely 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.680
 fans I'm arranging this video for 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.090
 my aunt who also passionate about 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.920
 photography etc. 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.750
 the boy he had sent him to 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.689
 assistance about a year ago I don't know 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.520
 how much we mounted the fans 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.610
 there is therefore who I have just arrived at 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.450
 my aunt's house I saw the pc inside 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.369
 a completely closed desk and me 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.140
 the shivers are still coming on 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.720
 goose bumps and just told me that in 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.579
 winter was like a space heater and it is 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.740
 this was fine though in the summer 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.540
 heater could not be thrown 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.000
 in fact, the former could work more 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.369
 once had a UPS itself 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.520
 literally melted the hold that 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.130
 there was food then imagine 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.320
 but today he will teach you how to do it 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.939
 treat a pc well maybe in the 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.040
 next episode we will make a good change 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.990
 cayce of the event the pluses but in 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.930
 this episode we will change how 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.840
 a soft ssb and ram modification I had made 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.060
 the guide for laptops and find it 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.009
 here click on the computer proof of 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.840
 guide for laptops and this one instead 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.860
 guide for landlines ok let's proceed 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.860
 taking apart the rams 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.020
 I recommend you try to touch less 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.060
 possible internal components because 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.220
 they could go short and not 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.860
 functional you can't go wrong there's a 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.870
 half tongue almost in half 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.310
 of the copper housing cannot be 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.620
 definitely be wrong about it 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.430
 concerns the insertion just exercise 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.989
 a slight force and the ram well assembled 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.500
 we do the same operation with 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.500
 the other one 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.680
 and the game is done with regards to 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.599
 the ssd the power supply does not have 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.030
 of the necessary attack so we will have to 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:52.000
 use an adapter that allows you to 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.739
 always use this attack but 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.409
 connecting a new hard drive 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.060
 precisely ssd disk generation in this 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:00.519
 If we look for a housing for the 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.280
 ssb because this case does not present 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.470
 precisely the housing for ssd then 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.810
 we are going to connect everything 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.359
 let's connect the hard in sata ii 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.730
 disk from a land there let's leave it as 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:17.260
 precisely backup we are going to connect and 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:19.900
 ssd in sata 1 I make a premise 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.750
 since I also have to change the keys in 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.209
 future to this pc at the moment I will not do 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.829
 a cable management company for me 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.840
 the keys must arrive as soon as the 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.370
 canis with the fans will proceed to do the 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.169
 all meanwhile installer all 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.489
 the operating system and all drivers 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:36.689
 what is needed 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.689
 inside this hard disk 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:44.090
 connect and with some scotch and 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.159
 very resistant we put a point in it 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.470
 which pleases us more in this case 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:50.329
 put right under the video card the 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.310
 our ssd is mounted we miss it 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:53.810
 install the driver and operating system 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.370
 various programs just to do 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.560
 operate the machine as already mentioned 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.420
 use this bis as a backup for 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.280
 store all the photos and pictures 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.049
 video this time you enjoyed it 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.970

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.260
 caricamente tech graupe that if you have 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.519
 any question for the world of pci e 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.440
 of technology 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:15.709
 you can ask see you with your neighbor 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.380
 video and let 300 like for the 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.430
