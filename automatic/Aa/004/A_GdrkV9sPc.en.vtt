00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 Today's tip is a cheap and easy tip 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.500
 how to create partitions to organize 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.300
 both your makeup and your 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.420
 luck or anything else that you 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.160
 then I want to materials 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:19.010
 you will need 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.810
 contact paper cardboard and scissors 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:25.519
 you will start measuring on paper at a 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.519
 width of your drawer 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.480
 and now you can use this first 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.460
 aerial split as mold 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.320
 if you prefer you can put two 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.020
 layers of cardboard that will leave your 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.390
 more resistant scissors 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.760
 if your drawer was with mine that did not 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.129
 open until the end you can use part of 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.620
 behind to put the products you - 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.739
 uses and the front to put the 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.239
 products you use most now you 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.199
 will start making the dividers 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.199
 vertical 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:12.760
 to join one division in the other you 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:14.890
 will make a cut that I recommend to be 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.960
 made after coating with a paper 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.790
 I'm late just doing there to 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.790
 show you how you're going to stay 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.040
 I used this until the contact of rose 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.550
 clear but you can use the color you want 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.550
 want to 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.640
 loose and now just start to ride 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:12.209
 I made the cut in one of the partitions 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.080
 horizontal and then see as mold for 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.080
 do in the other 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.340
 Now, you just have to pack your 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.650
 Makeup accessory Whatever you want 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.880
 I did it in the bathroom drawer because at 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.890
 Sometimes I like to leave some 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.050
 Makeup in the bathroom but if you go 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.120
 do in the drawer of your dresser 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.150
 I recommend that you use two layers of 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.160
 cardboard in order to become more child 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.870

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.580
