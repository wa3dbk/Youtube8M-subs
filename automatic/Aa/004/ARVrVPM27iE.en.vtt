00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
average out to about eighty dollars per

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.740 
average out to about eighty dollars per
bottle<00:02:22.659> which<00:02:23.439> is<00:02:23.620> comparable<00:02:24.010> to<00:02:24.280> other

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
bottle which is comparable to other

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.750 
bottle which is comparable to other
eyelash<00:02:25.750> treatments<00:02:26.319> such<00:02:26.500> as<00:02:26.530> rapid<00:02:27.519> lash

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
eyelash treatments such as rapid lash

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.149 
eyelash treatments such as rapid lash
and<00:02:28.980> whatnot<00:02:31.139> latisse<00:02:32.139> is<00:02:32.409> approved<00:02:32.950> by<00:02:33.099> the

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
FDA actually it's the only approved

FDA actually it's the only approved
eyelash<00:02:36.609> growth<00:02:36.849> treatment<00:02:37.329> by<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.510> FDA<00:02:38.019> so

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
eyelash growth treatment by the FDA so

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.479 
eyelash growth treatment by the FDA so
in<00:02:39.310> my<00:02:39.579> mind<00:02:39.609> and<00:02:40.299> made<00:02:40.569> it<00:02:40.750> worth<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.290> money

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
in my mind and made it worth the money

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:47.369 
in my mind and made it worth the money
more<00:02:42.489> so<00:02:42.730> than<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:43.030> other<00:02:43.180> products<00:02:45.750> in<00:02:46.750> order

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:47.379 
more so than the other products in order

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.839 
more so than the other products in order
to<00:02:47.560> make<00:02:47.709> this<00:02:47.919> last<00:02:48.250> longer<00:02:48.909> I<00:02:49.150> would<00:02:49.629> apply

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
to make this last longer I would apply

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.909 
to make this last longer I would apply
just<00:02:51.849> one<00:02:52.269> drop<00:02:52.659> in<00:02:52.900> here<00:02:53.319> and<00:02:53.500> then<00:02:53.650> I<00:02:53.680> would

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:53.919 
just one drop in here and then I would

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:58.800 
just one drop in here and then I would
take<00:02:54.099> an<00:02:54.280> applicator<00:02:56.909> part<00:02:57.909> of<00:02:58.030> me<00:02:58.209> that<00:02:58.750> I

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
take an applicator part of me that I

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.319 
take an applicator part of me that I
would<00:02:58.989> apply<00:02:59.319> it<00:02:59.379> to<00:02:59.620> both<00:02:59.799> lash<00:03:00.069> lines<00:03:00.459> and<00:03:01.469> I

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
would apply it to both lash lines and I

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.729 
would apply it to both lash lines and I
would<00:03:04.329> usually<00:03:04.540> have<00:03:04.750> some<00:03:05.079> access<00:03:05.260> so<00:03:05.709> i

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
would usually have some access so i

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.530 
would usually have some access so i
would<00:03:06.069> apply<00:03:06.310> it<00:03:06.370> to<00:03:06.609> my<00:03:06.639> eyebrows<00:03:07.919> um<00:03:08.919> I<00:03:09.540> will

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
would apply it to my eyebrows um I will

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.050 
would apply it to my eyebrows um I will
make<00:03:11.049> this<00:03:11.079> statement<00:03:11.439> that<00:03:11.859> the<00:03:12.159> FDA<00:03:12.519> did<00:03:12.939> not

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
make this statement that the FDA did not

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.289 
make this statement that the FDA did not
approve<00:03:13.510> this<00:03:13.719> for<00:03:14.049> use<00:03:14.260> on<00:03:14.500> the<00:03:14.769> eyebrows

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
approve this for use on the eyebrows

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.759 
approve this for use on the eyebrows
however<00:03:16.299> I've<00:03:16.689> done<00:03:16.900> some<00:03:17.109> research<00:03:17.290> online

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
however I've done some research online

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.740 
however I've done some research online
and<00:03:18.930> it<00:03:19.930> seems<00:03:20.440> like<00:03:21.209> doctors<00:03:22.209> are<00:03:22.389> split

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
and it seems like doctors are split

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.960 
and it seems like doctors are split
between<00:03:22.780> using<00:03:23.590> it<00:03:23.739> on<00:03:23.919> the<00:03:24.220> eyebrows<00:03:24.579> and<00:03:24.790> not

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
between using it on the eyebrows and not

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.059 
between using it on the eyebrows and not
it<00:03:25.569> seems<00:03:25.810> like<00:03:25.989> the<00:03:26.139> only<00:03:26.260> reason<00:03:26.769> that<00:03:26.799> the

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
it seems like the only reason that the

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.580 
it seems like the only reason that the
ones<00:03:27.310> are<00:03:27.639> saying<00:03:27.940> advising<00:03:28.540> not<00:03:28.780> to<00:03:29.169> use<00:03:29.349> it

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
ones are saying advising not to use it

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.629 
ones are saying advising not to use it
it's<00:03:30.129> because<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.609> FDA<00:03:30.760> did<00:03:31.209> not<00:03:31.359> approve<00:03:31.689> it

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
it's because the FDA did not approve it

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:36.539 
it's because the FDA did not approve it
but<00:03:34.169> the<00:03:35.169> others<00:03:35.470> have<00:03:35.769> stated<00:03:35.979> that<00:03:36.280> they've

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
but the others have stated that they've

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.530 
but the others have stated that they've
had<00:03:36.579> patients<00:03:37.239> used<00:03:37.479> it<00:03:37.720> and<00:03:37.959> it<00:03:38.949> was<00:03:39.819> fine<00:03:40.090> and

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
had patients used it and it was fine and

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.020 
had patients used it and it was fine and
it<00:03:40.689> worked<00:03:40.930> so<00:03:43.590> unto<00:03:44.590> the<00:03:45.009> results<00:03:45.519> I've<00:03:45.699> seen

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
it worked so unto the results I've seen

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.939 
it worked so unto the results I've seen
from<00:03:46.269> using<00:03:46.599> this<00:03:46.750> product<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:49.319> the<00:03:50.319> missing

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
remember it being much quicker than

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.119 
remember it being much quicker than
previously<00:04:10.599> when<00:04:11.019> I<00:04:11.049> would<00:04:11.349> just<00:04:11.560> wait<00:04:11.739> for<00:04:12.069> it

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:12.129 
previously when I would just wait for it

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:16.979 
previously when I would just wait for it
to<00:04:12.189> go<00:04:12.489> back<00:04:12.519> I<00:04:13.859> do<00:04:14.859> notice<00:04:15.790> that<00:04:16.269> my<00:04:16.389> eyelashes

mascara<00:04:23.650> and<00:04:24.070> they<00:04:25.000> seem<00:04:25.270> to

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
mascara and they seem to

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.820 
mascara and they seem to

claim of making the eyelashes darker I

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.879 
claim of making the eyelashes darker I
really<00:04:41.669> did<00:04:41.910> not<00:04:41.940> see<00:04:42.389> this<00:04:42.660> but<00:04:43.320> it<00:04:43.530> might<00:04:43.680> be

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
really did not see this but it might be

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:46.730 
really did not see this but it might be
because<00:04:44.160> I<00:04:44.400> naturally<00:04:45.270> have<00:04:45.740> dark-colored

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740

because I naturally have dark-colored
lashes<00:04:48.830> this<00:04:49.830> might<00:04:50.130> be<00:04:50.160> something<00:04:50.970> that<00:04:51.449> a

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
lashes this might be something that a

more fair haired person would observe so

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.560 
more fair haired person would observe so
I<00:04:56.250> would<00:04:56.699> not<00:04:56.880> discard<00:04:57.650> that<00:04:58.650> claim<00:04:59.570> just

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:08.300 
I would not discard that claim just
based<00:05:00.810> on<00:05:01.050> me<00:05:02.600> because<00:05:03.600> of<00:05:03.780> my<00:05:03.930> features<00:05:07.310> what

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
based on me because of my features what

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.890 
based on me because of my features what
else<00:05:08.460> do<00:05:08.699> I<00:05:08.760> want<00:05:08.970> to<00:05:09.090> mention<00:05:11.150> mmm<00:05:12.150> also<00:05:12.660> when

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
else do I want to mention mmm also when

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.750 
else do I want to mention mmm also when
you<00:05:13.020> use<00:05:13.199> this<00:05:13.380> at<00:05:13.620> night<00:05:13.800> you<00:05:14.039> do<00:05:14.190> not<00:05:14.370> want

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
you use this at night you do not want

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.570 
you use this at night you do not want
anything<00:05:15.180> around<00:05:15.600> the<00:05:15.780> ipro<00:05:16.289> around<00:05:16.889> your

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
anything around the ipro around your

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.150 
anything around the ipro around your
lashline<00:05:17.850> which<00:05:18.780> means<00:05:19.080> that<00:05:19.380> not<00:05:19.650> applying

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
lashline which means that not applying

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.580 
lashline which means that not applying
eye<00:05:20.460> cream<00:05:20.760> at<00:05:20.940> all<00:05:21.120> so<00:05:21.780> you<00:05:21.840> will<00:05:22.260> have<00:05:22.320> to

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
eye cream at all so you will have to

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.610 
eye cream at all so you will have to
apply<00:05:22.800> your<00:05:23.010> eye<00:05:23.039> cream<00:05:23.370> in<00:05:23.490> the<00:05:23.580> morning<00:05:24.620> the

apply your eye cream in the morning the

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.330 
apply your eye cream in the morning the
reason<00:05:25.949> behind<00:05:26.070> this<00:05:26.460> is<00:05:26.520> that<00:05:26.729> the<00:05:27.449> product

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
reason behind this is that the product

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.810 
reason behind this is that the product
might<00:05:29.539> inhibit<00:05:30.710> the<00:05:31.710> absorption<00:05:31.919> of<00:05:32.460> the

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
might inhibit the absorption of the

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.490 
might inhibit the absorption of the
Latisse<00:05:33.240> in<00:05:33.570> your<00:05:33.840> lashline<00:05:34.080> i<00:05:35.690> am<00:05:36.690> at<00:05:36.990> about

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
Latisse in your lashline i am at about

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:43.640 
Latisse in your lashline i am at about
week<00:05:37.800> 10<00:05:38.310> of<00:05:38.639> the<00:05:38.940> treatment<00:05:39.979> and<00:05:42.229> the<00:05:43.229> Latisse

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
week 10 of the treatment and the Latisse

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.800 
week 10 of the treatment and the Latisse
company<00:05:44.160> claims<00:05:44.520> that<00:05:44.910> you<00:05:45.210> will<00:05:45.330> see<00:05:45.570> the

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
company claims that you will see the

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.520 
company claims that you will see the
most<00:05:46.020> dramatic<00:05:46.849> results<00:05:47.849> around<00:05:48.180> 16<00:05:48.900> weeks<00:05:49.200> I

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
most dramatic results around 16 weeks I

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.440 
most dramatic results around 16 weeks I
think<00:05:50.310> this<00:05:50.490> will<00:05:50.639> take<00:05:50.849> me<00:05:51.030> a<00:05:51.060> little<00:05:51.300> bit

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.450 
think this will take me a little bit

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.680 
think this will take me a little bit
longer<00:05:51.840> because<00:05:52.200> I<00:05:52.800> try<00:05:53.580> my<00:05:53.760> best<00:05:54.030> to<00:05:54.330> use<00:05:54.450> this

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
longer because I try my best to use this

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.129 
longer because I try my best to use this
every<00:05:55.050> night<00:05:55.080> but<00:05:56.389> just<00:05:57.389> sometimes<00:05:57.599> it<00:05:57.960> just

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:58.139 
every night but just sometimes it just

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:00.370 
every night but just sometimes it just
doesn't<00:05:58.349> work<00:05:58.620> with<00:05:59.190> school<00:05:59.550> and<00:05:59.610> everything

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
doesn't work with school and everything

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.870 
doesn't work with school and everything
sometimes<00:06:01.380> I<00:06:01.530> just<00:06:01.590> get<00:06:01.860> tired<00:06:02.099> and<00:06:02.580> I<00:06:02.669> fall

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
sometimes I just get tired and I fall

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.240 
sometimes I just get tired and I fall
asleep<00:06:03.240> without<00:06:03.419> using<00:06:03.810> it<00:06:04.169> or<00:06:04.500> I<00:06:04.530> just<00:06:04.889> forgot

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
asleep without using it or I just forgot

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.430 
asleep without using it or I just forgot
or<00:06:05.580> I'm<00:06:06.120> somewhere<00:06:06.630> else<00:06:06.810> and<00:06:07.080> I<00:06:07.169> forget<00:06:07.380> to

or I'm somewhere else and I forget to
bring<00:06:07.650> it<00:06:07.770> with<00:06:07.949> me<00:06:07.979> but<00:06:08.430> I<00:06:08.820> probably<00:06:09.120> do<00:06:09.690> use
