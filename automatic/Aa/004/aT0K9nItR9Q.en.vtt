exactly<00:04:54.240> how<00:04:54.360> it<00:04:54.479> does<00:04:54.630> I<00:04:54.780> think<00:04:55.229> he<00:04:55.440> does<00:04:56.330> show

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
exactly how it does I think he does show

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:05.389 
exactly how it does I think he does show
no<00:05:00.740> stroke<00:05:01.740> down<00:05:02.070> stroke<00:05:02.130> up<00:05:02.610> stroke<00:05:02.639> so<00:05:03.210> it's
