00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
hi I'm yours goes in and I'm gonna take

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.059 
hi I'm yours goes in and I'm gonna take
you<00:00:04.319> for<00:00:04.589> a<00:00:04.910> gates<00:00:05.910> +<00:00:06.180> tutorial<00:00:06.710> so<00:00:07.710> let's

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
you for a gates + tutorial so let's

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.740 
you for a gates + tutorial so let's
start<00:00:10.099> so<00:00:11.099> i<00:00:11.309> have<00:00:11.580> already<00:00:11.790> built<00:00:12.269> my<00:00:12.450> frame

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
start so i have already built my frame

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.410 
start so i have already built my frame
for<00:00:13.200> my<00:00:13.230> gates<00:00:13.500> so<00:00:14.340> I<00:00:14.610> just<00:00:14.910> gonna<00:00:15.089> place<00:00:15.269> my

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
for my gates so I just gonna place my

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.720 
for my gates so I just gonna place my
blocks<00:00:15.830> to<00:00:16.830> get<00:00:17.010> my<00:00:17.160> coordinates<00:00:17.820> of<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.180> gate

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
blocks to get my coordinates of the gate

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:27.830 
blocks to get my coordinates of the gate
then<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:20.760> type<00:00:21.570> GP<00:00:22.400> test<00:00:23.869> not<00:00:24.869> create<00:00:26.330> test<00:00:27.330> yeah

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
then I type GP test not create test yeah

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.169 
then I type GP test not create test yeah
my<00:00:28.320> guess<00:00:28.500> so<00:00:28.980> now<00:00:29.460> I'd<00:00:29.580> like<00:00:29.760> my<00:00:29.939> first

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
my guess so now I'd like my first

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.590 
my guess so now I'd like my first
location<00:00:30.570> at<00:00:30.840> my<00:00:30.960> second<00:00:31.759> then<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:32.790> go<00:00:32.969> an

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
location at my second then I go an

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.819 
location at my second then I go an
example<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.140> gate<00:00:34.320> that's<00:00:34.739> how<00:00:35.070> big<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.430> is

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
example of the gate that's how big it is

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:42.470 
example of the gate that's how big it is
and<00:00:39.050> then<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.230> gonna<00:00:40.530> confirm<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.280> by<00:00:41.489> typing<00:00:41.850> GP

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
and then I gonna confirm it by typing GP

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.729 
and then I gonna confirm it by typing GP
create<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.170> that's<00:00:43.770> my<00:00:43.980> gate<00:00:44.520> has<00:00:44.789> been<00:00:44.820> saved

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
create so that's my gate has been saved

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.520 
create so that's my gate has been saved
if<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:47.280> power<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.210> gate<00:00:48.420> it's<00:00:48.780> gonna<00:00:49.260> go<00:00:49.500> up

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
if you power the gate it's gonna go up

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.660 
if you power the gate it's gonna go up
if<00:00:50.520> it's<00:00:51.270> not<00:00:51.480> powered<00:00:51.870> it's<00:00:52.559> gonna<00:00:52.800> go<00:00:52.980> come

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
if it's not powered it's gonna go come

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.560 
if it's not powered it's gonna go come
down<00:00:54.860> stand<00:00:55.860> easy<00:00:56.039> it's<00:00:56.399> protected<00:00:56.910> against

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
down stand easy it's protected against

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.760 
down stand easy it's protected against
griefing<00:00:58.199> like<00:00:58.879> try<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.910> break<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.449> all

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
griefing like try to break it all

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:09.000 
griefing like try to break it all
setting<00:01:01.770> on<00:01:01.890> fire

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.910 

you<00:01:10.010> can<00:01:10.190> also<00:01:10.490> set<00:01:11.300> the<00:01:11.330> material<00:01:11.930> of<00:01:12.080> the

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
you can also set the material of the

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:20.200 
you can also set the material of the
gate<00:01:14.020> doing<00:01:15.020> it<00:01:15.170> by<00:01:15.860> typing<00:01:17.680> GP<00:01:18.680> Saddam<00:01:19.210> your

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
gate doing it by typing GP Saddam your

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.670 
gate doing it by typing GP Saddam your
gay<00:01:20.480> name<00:01:20.720> and<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:21.320> material<00:01:21.770> ID<00:01:21.980> number<00:01:23.680> it

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
gay name and the material ID number it

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.030 
gay name and the material ID number it
still<00:01:25.220> works<00:01:25.400> like<00:01:26.030> only<00:01:26.600> does<00:01:27.050> but<00:01:27.500> will<00:01:27.890> not

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
still works like only does but will not

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:35.190 
still works like only does but will not
a<00:01:28.100> material<00:01:31.690> now<00:01:32.690> I<00:01:32.720> gonna<00:01:33.020> go<00:01:33.740> list<00:01:34.160> my<00:01:34.370> kids

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
a material now I gonna go list my kids

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.200 
a material now I gonna go list my kids
you<00:01:36.200> see<00:01:36.410> I<00:01:36.440> have<00:01:36.620> one<00:01:36.860> of<00:01:36.980> the<00:01:37.130> five<00:01:37.400> and<00:01:37.700> my

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
you see I have one of the five and my

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.640 
you see I have one of the five and my
gate<00:01:38.450> our<00:01:38.690> test<00:01:39.440> there's<00:01:40.040> only<00:01:40.250> one<00:01:40.430> I<00:01:40.550> got<00:01:40.640> I

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
gate our test there's only one I got I

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.340 
gate our test there's only one I got I
mean<00:01:42.650> now<00:01:42.770> I<00:01:42.800> gonna<00:01:43.100> delete<00:01:43.370> it<00:01:43.490> because<00:01:44.350> again

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
mean now I gonna delete it because again

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.560 
mean now I gonna delete it because again
that's<00:01:46.040> why<00:01:47.110> so<00:01:48.110> let's<00:01:48.500> delete<00:01:48.770> it<00:01:49.420> we<00:01:50.420> don't

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
that's why so let's delete it we don't

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.990 
that's why so let's delete it we don't
need<00:01:50.930> that<00:01:51.260> anymore<00:01:51.320> not<00:01:52.280> doing<00:01:52.550> anything<00:01:52.760> at

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
need that anymore not doing anything at

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.000 
need that anymore not doing anything at
all<00:01:53.620> okay<00:01:54.620> if<00:01:55.550> I<00:01:56.120> do<00:01:56.500> GP<00:01:57.640> list<00:01:58.640> gates<00:01:59.450> odds<00:02:00.010> damn

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
all okay if I do GP list gates odds damn

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.469 
all okay if I do GP list gates odds damn
it<00:02:01.160> typed<00:02:01.760> it<00:02:01.910> wrong<00:02:01.940> again<00:02:02.710> let's<00:02:03.710> gates<00:02:04.010> and

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
it typed it wrong again let's gates and

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.580 
it typed it wrong again let's gates and
play<00:02:05.479> a<00:02:05.510> name<00:02:05.750> like<00:02:06.040> says<00:02:07.060> my<00:02:08.290> brother<00:02:09.290> Tom

play a name like says my brother Tom
class<00:02:09.800> three<00:02:10.190> its<00:02:12.370> gonna<00:02:13.370> let<00:02:13.550> the<00:02:13.670> gates<00:02:13.880> of

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
class three its gonna let the gates of

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.310 
class three its gonna let the gates of
that<00:02:14.600> player<00:02:14.810> you<00:02:15.580> type<00:02:16.580> but<00:02:17.270> it<00:02:17.810> doesn't<00:02:18.200> have

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
that player you type but it doesn't have

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.750 
that player you type but it doesn't have
any<00:02:19.190> just<00:02:19.640> I'm<00:02:19.850> not<00:02:19.910> going<00:02:20.540> to<00:02:20.660> do<00:02:20.840> that<00:02:21.760> keep

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
any just I'm not going to do that keep

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.870 
any just I'm not going to do that keep
it<00:02:22.940> a<00:02:23.150> GP<00:02:23.630> delete<00:02:24.170> gates<00:02:24.440> with<00:02:25.190> a<00:02:25.220> plane<00:02:25.489> in<00:02:25.670> and

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
it a GP delete gates with a plane in and

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.010 
it a GP delete gates with a plane in and
the<00:02:26.150> gate<00:02:26.450> named<00:02:27.280> Mike<00:02:28.280> test<00:02:28.810> it's<00:02:29.810> gonna

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
the gate named Mike test it's gonna

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.640 
the gate named Mike test it's gonna
delete<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.920> gate<00:02:31.100> of<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.430> player<00:02:32.030> and<00:02:32.650> kate

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
delete the gate of the player and kate

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.740 
delete the gate of the player and kate
is<00:02:33.770> gonna<00:02:33.920> delete<00:02:34.220> this<00:02:34.370> test<00:02:34.610> but<00:02:35.269> it<00:02:35.450> doesn't

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
is gonna delete this test but it doesn't

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.180 
is gonna delete this test but it doesn't
have<00:02:35.989> a<00:02:36.170> gate<00:02:36.380> so<00:02:37.100> I<00:02:37.390> won't<00:02:38.390> do<00:02:38.510> that

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
have a gate so I won't do that

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.620 
have a gate so I won't do that
now<00:02:41.190> I'm<00:02:41.340> going<00:02:41.520> to<00:02:41.610> talk<00:02:41.730> about<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.240> config

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
now I'm going to talk about the config
