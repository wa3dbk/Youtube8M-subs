00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.059
 Regards greetings here your friend and if not 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.370
 the brother asks to keep us 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.969
 informed about the destination world 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.280
 well today we are going to talk about something that 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.310
 speaks very little about the subject of the factions 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.860
 and above all the utility that can be 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.540
 that can be given but I 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.360
 you will ask what I do open with the 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.220
 good menu before choosing a faction 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.410
 you have to be very clear about some 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.289
 concepts and especially what kind of 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.760
 guardian want to use for example we 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:38.519
 let's come to the attributes of the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:43.589
 armor that as you all know are 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:46.379
 intellect discipline and strength I in this 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:49.250
 case although I have intellect zero but my 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.750
 interest is that the character 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.950
 according to the description of the attribute 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.170
 reduce gun recovery time 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.610
 golden and you can use them more times in 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.520
 this moment I have zero because the 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.290
 equipment that I have does not have anything of 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.760
 intellect but I'm interested because 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.760
 example right now I have more defenses 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.650
 but I want to reinforce this attribute 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.150
 then we have the discipline that reduces 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.920
 the recovery time of the grenade 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.160
 and I finished and it allows you to use it in 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:19.140
 less time and then we have the strength 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:22.110
 the good throwing knife comes in handy 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.700
 in some cases but I'm more interested in 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.700
 theme of the heart pistol then 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.570
 how are we going to apply this to the 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.570
 very simple factions let's look for the 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.840
 faction that facilitates or allows us 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.729
 in equipping ourselves with the attributes that most 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.100
 we like then in this case for 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.200
 example if you look at my character with 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.280
 these colors a little if bizarre 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:51.020
 but everything has its meaning but because 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.320
 him if you look 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:58.429
 in the mantle that I wear with a scarf is 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.490
 the future war clan because elected 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:03.610
 the future war plan 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:08.319
 we are here with the representative of the 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:11.849
 faction enter and if you notice that it is 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:16.000
 temporary is more in the equipment 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:17.410
 it offers intellect and intellect discipline 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.150
 discipline of this discipline among 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:24.190
 Cesar 12 as we go the main thing 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.950
 to get this equipment 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.140
 apart from the crucible you go to 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.209
 need to level up edge 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.420
 in this case in this faction like what 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:37.450
 we get by equipÃ¡ndonos com 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.950
 with elements of the faction in this case 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.200
 I already have it bought as you have 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.870
 seen the layer in the inventory 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.000
 OK 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.739
 but when you access level 20 you have 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.730
 available these two layers the one that I 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:53.260
 I wear it and this x was designed by 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.849
 astral at first I'm going to 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.849
 buy the austral sir but 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.360
 well I will say so without giving me 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.830
 account I gave to buy this so I 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.200
 touch to endure with the plot do not have already 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.560
 a little more lumen back of change 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.620
 then main for example distinguish 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.260
 of the clan the emblem 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.140
 as I ask only level 1 after 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.650
 you have the weapons they ask for level 3 and the 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.500
 equipment that they ask for level 2 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.080
 then it depends on what you want 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.270
 as i said 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.030
 enhances the attributes of your 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:33.580
 your guardian will choose a faction u 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.980
 another the twelve 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.770
 I'm not going to try to do it with 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.530
 all but I 'll start with this I'm going to do 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:44.440
 as a kind of guide ship but 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.960
 try to get the full character 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.470
 that is to say all the equipment of the 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:53.920
 faction and all the armament equipment 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.380
 of it so this will be the first 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.860
 of a few episode episodes and in the 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:02.380
 moment that is getting good 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:06.730
 the moment I get everything 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.110
 so I will teach today of events to the 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.230
 march because maybe it is very 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.670
 tedious to see how I'm getting one 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.370
 for one but simply when 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.739
 get or show it and I'll do it with all 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.959
 the factions so you can see a little 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.640
 as andante so a greeting 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.640
 guardians see you at the border
