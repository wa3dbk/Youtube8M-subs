00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
grease is pumped down the center to

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.799 
grease is pumped down the center to
lubricate<00:00:34.510> the<00:00:34.750> moving<00:00:34.960> parts<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:37.480> show<00:00:37.690> the

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:37.809 
lubricate the moving parts to show the

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:40.950 
lubricate the moving parts to show the
internal<00:00:38.170> detail<00:00:38.789> we<00:00:39.789> take<00:00:40.269> a<00:00:40.300> cutting<00:00:40.719> plane

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
internal detail we take a cutting plane

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.630 
internal detail we take a cutting plane
right<00:00:41.260> through<00:00:41.500> the<00:00:41.620> center<00:00:41.980> we<00:00:42.190> could

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
right through the center we could

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.069 
right through the center we could
through<00:00:42.969> that<00:00:43.180> way<00:00:43.359> because<00:00:43.510> it<00:00:43.660> shows<00:00:43.870> more

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079 
through that way because it shows more

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:46.049 
through that way because it shows more
detail<00:00:44.140> including<00:00:44.769> along<00:00:45.670> we<00:00:45.820> in<00:00:45.910> that

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
detail including along we in that

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:52.410 
detail including along we in that
direction<00:00:49.620> okay<00:00:50.620> we<00:00:51.519> really<00:00:51.730> only<00:00:52.030> need<00:00:52.269> to

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
direction okay we really only need to

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.560 
direction okay we really only need to
take<00:00:52.629> away<00:00:52.899> half<00:00:53.140> of<00:00:53.440> the<00:00:54.059> half<00:00:55.059> of<00:00:55.269> the<00:00:55.329> half

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
take away half of the half of the half

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.490 
take away half of the half of the half
of<00:00:55.780> the<00:00:56.160> front<00:00:57.160> section<00:00:58.030> because<00:00:58.390> this<00:00:59.170> part

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
of the front section because this part

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.189 
of the front section because this part
is<00:01:00.300> symmetrical<00:01:01.300> with<00:01:01.449> this<00:01:01.600> side<00:01:01.870> of<00:01:02.050> the

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
is symmetrical with this side of the

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:04.860 
is symmetrical with this side of the
bearing<00:01:03.039> so<00:01:03.249> we<00:01:03.550> can<00:01:03.730> we<00:01:04.089> can<00:01:04.239> get<00:01:04.360> the<00:01:04.480> benefit

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 
bearing so we can we can get the benefit

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.780 
bearing so we can we can get the benefit
of<00:01:04.989> an<00:01:05.080> internal<00:01:05.440> view<00:01:05.680> and<00:01:05.950> an<00:01:06.100> external<00:01:06.610> view

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
of an internal view and an external view

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:20.580 
of an internal view and an external view
on<00:01:07.030> the<00:01:07.689> same<00:01:07.930> drawing<00:01:18.899> taking<00:01:19.899> away<00:01:20.079> the<00:01:20.259> that

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
on the same drawing taking away the that

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.370 
on the same drawing taking away the that
corner<00:01:21.100> of<00:01:21.280> the<00:01:21.460> back<00:01:21.790> quarter<00:01:22.180> of<00:01:22.270> the<00:01:22.390> model

corner of the back quarter of the model

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.710 
corner of the back quarter of the model
now<00:01:23.560> and<00:01:24.310> we<00:01:24.460> can<00:01:24.610> see<00:01:24.820> the<00:01:25.060> section<00:01:25.479> lines

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
now and we can see the section lines

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.359 
now and we can see the section lines
which<00:01:25.930> would<00:01:26.110> be<00:01:26.229> shown<00:01:26.470> on<00:01:26.619> a<00:01:26.680> drawing<00:01:27.040> you

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
which would be shown on a drawing you

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.240 
which would be shown on a drawing you
can<00:01:28.270> imagine<00:01:28.570> these<00:01:28.930> as<00:01:29.229> sword<00:01:29.740> lines<00:01:30.009> if<00:01:30.220> you

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
can imagine these as sword lines if you

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.340 
can imagine these as sword lines if you
like<00:01:30.630> except<00:01:31.630> that<00:01:31.780> they<00:01:31.869> are<00:01:31.899> going<00:01:32.140> in

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
like except that they are going in

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.289 
like except that they are going in
different<00:01:32.380> directions<00:01:32.710> on<00:01:33.520> each<00:01:33.700> of<00:01:34.000> the

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
different directions on each of the

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.389 
different directions on each of the
components<00:01:34.540> this<00:01:35.409> is<00:01:35.469> to<00:01:35.770> show<00:01:35.979> that<00:01:36.219> they<00:01:36.369> are

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
components this is to show that they are

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.760 
components this is to show that they are
different<00:01:36.790> components<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:41.560> main

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
different components the the main

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.830 
different components the the main
bearing<00:01:42.250> itself<00:01:42.610> is<00:01:42.880> not<00:01:43.060> section<00:01:43.540> because

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
bearing itself is not section because

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.170 
bearing itself is not section because
this<00:01:43.960> is<00:01:44.110> classed<00:01:44.409> as<00:01:44.560> a<00:01:44.590> thin<00:01:44.950> part<00:01:45.280> and<00:01:45.789> it's

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
this is classed as a thin part and it's

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.749 
this is classed as a thin part and it's
just<00:01:46.420> shaded<00:01:47.289> in<00:01:47.439> solid<00:01:47.890> as<00:01:48.039> we've<00:01:48.310> got<00:01:48.520> on

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
just shaded in solid as we've got on

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.340 
just shaded in solid as we've got on
this<00:01:49.299> drawing<00:01:49.539> figure<00:01:50.049> 138<00:01:50.740> inbound<00:01:51.280> II<00:01:52.350> here

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.050 
this drawing figure 138 inbound II here
we<00:01:53.469> just<00:01:53.680> got<00:01:53.829> a<00:01:53.860> washer<00:01:54.280> here<00:01:54.460> that's<00:01:54.670> that's

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
we just got a washer here that's that's

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.120 
we just got a washer here that's that's
obviously<00:01:55.509> a<00:01:55.600> thin<00:01:55.869> component<00:01:56.680> and<00:01:57.039> that's

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
obviously a thin component and that's

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.459 
obviously a thin component and that's
shaded<00:01:57.549> in<00:01:57.670> solid<00:01:58.090> when<00:01:58.810> you<00:01:58.930> have<00:01:59.079> several

thin components together we artificially
introduce<00:02:04.539> air<00:02:04.780> gaps<00:02:05.170> between<00:02:05.409> them<00:02:05.770> also<00:02:05.950> you

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
introduce air gaps between them also you

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.420 
introduce air gaps between them also you
can<00:02:06.430> visualize<00:02:06.939> the<00:02:07.659> different<00:02:08.050> components

similar component and there are a few

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.150 
similar component and there are a few
points<00:02:34.930> I'd<00:02:35.230> like<00:02:35.260> to<00:02:35.440> make<00:02:35.590> about<00:02:35.980> the

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
points I'd like to make about the

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.400 
points I'd like to make about the

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
drawing one is that the cutting plane

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.309 
drawing one is that the cutting plane
goes<00:02:38.709> right<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.610> way<00:02:39.640> through<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.750> component
