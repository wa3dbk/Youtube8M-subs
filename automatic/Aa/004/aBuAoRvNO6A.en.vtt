00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.830
 very very good girls, boys of 10 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:13.430
 verses and we are in a new news and 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.640
 attention because gamestop criticizes the 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.930
 low prices of digital games 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:21.680
 so do not make the games so expensive 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.960
 pim pam pilota that is said here in my 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.210
 good people as part toni 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.790
 president of gamestop and one of the 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.009
 Companies with more presence in the sale 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:34.340
 of video games shows its concern 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.950
 because of the digital increase it seems that 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.560
 boss of gamestop do not start to 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.510
 balance the accounts and as I have done 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.370
 at other times we must recognize has 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.580
 jumped in today criticize of a 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.800
 digital distribution before 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.020
 uncertainty or secrecy that the 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.970
 own company keeps around in 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.490
 around the sale of digital content of 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.670
 second hand the whole part shows its 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:00.290
 concern about this new trend 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.270
 and according to the president of gamestop this 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.850
 phenomenon could be a problem not 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.830
 only for your company but for the 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.190
 video game industry in general 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.290
 the highest leader of the company says 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.960
 argues that in a recent study 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.030
 shows that the average price a user 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.580
 pay for a triple game 'a' for 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.590
 download from $ 22 is not 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.200
 specific neither platform nor time 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.660
 since its launch it is the same user 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.880
 I would be willing to pay up to 35 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.340
 dollars for that game still like this to your 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.020
 judgment an unsustainable price taking 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.850
 note that the same game in format 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.950
 physical is at 60 dollars 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.950
 the truth is that the problem is that 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.110
 games are really commissions 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.840
 physicists here in Spain are at 70 euros 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.659
 most of them launch and it's 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.969
 an excessively expensive price 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.929
 and many of us have to opt 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:58.119
 for a game I for example still 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:00.390
 I only bought the fifa in everything 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.740
 that we have of year although you do not believe it 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.929
 but I've seen it some a box and what 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.149
 what is something here, something else is 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:09.310
 the steam digital games that by 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.019
 good thanks to the web pages that 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.230
 they have competitive prices as they go 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.640
 falling one after another and but the truth is 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.470
 what 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.270
 is quite strong in price of the 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.459
 digital games is the price of the game 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.110
 physical forgiveness is to speak on a subject 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.600
 apart but what is the price that 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.400
 you think it would be right for 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.530
 a physical launch and especially for 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.330
 a digital release thanks to all 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.480
