00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:07.440
 a time travel back on the road in the audi 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.639
 v8 with dieter is steady and yet everything is 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.070
 like in old times 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.070
 it is really crazy 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:21.869
 So if she was not mine today 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:24.000
 of course the s8 of the a8's new with 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.689
 the air suspension is of course something 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.990
 other things are clear but for the 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:36.570
 At that time I have to say that was it 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:39.809
 stop already and he drives 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.239
 so beautiful if you want the one 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.629
 Once again it gets used to it 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:51.829
 a wonderful author and not his 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:01:00.289
 only audi at least thirty started 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:01:00.289
 actually around k 70 euro 80 and then 200 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:09.600
 88 rs4 power they were always allowed to have 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.520
 the 30 audi of the dieter I stand there 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.590
 today together with his wife evi one 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.479
 trip to the Ingolstadt museum 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.490
 takes advantage of technology 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.369
 the Sticks belongs already to 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:28.799
 family tradition 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:31.759
 My father likes and always likes 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:37.070
 drive 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:40.970
 in the blood too because I know that children 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:43.619
 my father was in neuburg pretty much 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.509
 one of the few having the car and 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.130
 we are also children of the 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.990
 school has been picked up the car 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.990
 then the other children have already 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.470
 insane 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.780
 Today the bars call it more than 1000 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.360
 Audi psi rides the car park is 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.870
 attractively staffed 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:10.990
 this is my business car that has that 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:13.920
 is an s8 with the driver in the year 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:17.110
 about 50 to 60 thousand kilometers 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:21.610
 not a shocker but a real one 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:23.459
 long-haul car are the most important 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.580
 in my opinion the seats 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:30.190
 so that you are really good and there 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.590
 These sports seats are the best 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:37.530
 assumption then I need so 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:40.890
 phone unfortunately and what is very important 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:44.200
 efficient air conditioning 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.050
 I still enjoy driving a car 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.970
 although i think so i think so 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.950
 for sure 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.670
 well one to two million kilometers 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:57.970
 I have always driven and I can always 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:01.540
 still for car enthusiasts his 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.430
 second car a tt convertible and direct 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.120
 Besides 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:11.530
 So that's my wife's car 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.299
 dream she always wanted to have a rs4 and 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.450
 thank god you can afford otherwise 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:18.160
 and then we have this rs4 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.100
 still purchased 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.440
 My wife says he runs like the pest 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:27.010
 I'm not allowed to ride 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.170
 this is the car of my wife and 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:33.660
 In addition, we are constantly revealing ourselves 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.660
 He does not feel black cars at all
