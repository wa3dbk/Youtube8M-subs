00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
bag so first off let me start with the

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.370 
bag so first off let me start with the
cons<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.420> there's<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.810> lot<00:01:34.080> to<00:01:34.439> list<00:01:36.170> first<00:01:37.170> off

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
it's hard to open with one hand since

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.600 
it's hard to open with one hand since
this<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:43.910> the<00:01:44.910> front<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:46.040> covered<00:01:47.040> with<00:01:47.220> the

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
flap and the flap goes all the way down

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.470 
flap and the flap goes all the way down
to<00:01:49.620> the<00:01:49.710> bottom<00:01:49.890> it's<00:01:50.520> fairly<00:01:50.850> heavy<00:01:51.180> when<00:01:51.420> you

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
to the bottom it's fairly heavy when you

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.840 
to the bottom it's fairly heavy when you
open<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.410> also<00:01:52.710> my<00:01:53.220> nails<00:01:53.430> aren't<00:01:53.610> even

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
single strap so functionalize I would

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.309 
single strap so functionalize I would
not<00:03:41.250> consider<00:03:41.639> this<00:03:42.000> bag<00:03:42.299> a<00:03:42.599> very<00:03:42.930> practical

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
not consider this bag a very practical

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.339 
not consider this bag a very practical

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
bag and I wish it had middle feet and

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:49.789 
bag and I wish it had middle feet and
also<00:03:47.069> a<00:03:47.099> back<00:03:47.400> pocket<00:03:47.870> another<00:03:48.870> con<00:03:49.229> is<00:03:49.260> I'm

also a back pocket another con is I'm

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.000 
also a back pocket another con is I'm
just<00:03:49.829> not<00:03:50.010> sure<00:03:50.129> how<00:03:50.519> tough<00:03:51.530> how<00:03:52.530> well<00:03:52.739> these

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
just not sure how tough how well these

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.729 
just not sure how tough how well these
male<00:03:54.000> anchors<00:03:54.479> will<00:03:54.720> hold<00:03:54.959> up<00:03:55.199> and<00:03:55.440> think<00:03:55.620> it

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
male anchors will hold up and think it

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.979 
male anchors will hold up and think it
also<00:03:56.419> as<00:03:57.419> part<00:03:57.780> of<00:03:57.810> why<00:03:58.019> it's<00:03:58.319> really<00:03:58.680> hard<00:03:58.949> to

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
also as part of why it's really hard to

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:05.539 
also as part of why it's really hard to
open<00:04:00.989> this<00:04:01.109> flap<00:04:01.229> fully<00:04:03.859> with<00:04:04.859> one<00:04:05.069> hand<00:04:05.310> you

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
open this flap fully with one hand you

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.009 
open this flap fully with one hand you
really<00:04:05.790> just<00:04:05.939> have<00:04:06.030> to<00:04:06.180> do<00:04:06.389> it<00:04:06.479> with<00:04:06.599> two<00:04:06.780> hands

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
really just have to do it with two hands

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.229 
really just have to do it with two hands
because<00:04:07.139> these<00:04:07.979> are<00:04:08.159> fairly<00:04:08.459> heavy<00:04:08.849> with<00:04:09.209> a

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
because these are fairly heavy with a

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.390 
because these are fairly heavy with a
chain<00:04:09.510> here<00:04:09.780> to<00:04:10.019> sew<00:04:10.379> so<00:04:11.159> you're<00:04:11.280> probably

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
chain here to sew so you're probably

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.909 
chain here to sew so you're probably
wondering<00:04:11.609> why<00:04:12.150> I<00:04:12.629> actually<00:04:13.109> still<00:04:13.590> would

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
wondering why I actually still would

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:16.969 
wondering why I actually still would
recommend<00:04:14.459> this<00:04:14.669> bag<00:04:15.259> given<00:04:16.259> all<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.470> cons<00:04:16.739> I

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
just told you about and that's really

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.409 
just told you about and that's really
because<00:04:20.820> of<00:04:21.680> the<00:04:22.680> style<00:04:23.070> and<00:04:23.280> look<00:04:23.610> of<00:04:23.639> the<00:04:24.240> bag

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
because of the style and look of the bag

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.409 
because of the style and look of the bag
I<00:04:24.840> just<00:04:25.710> love<00:04:25.949> the<00:04:26.310> look<00:04:26.550> and<00:04:26.729> style<00:04:27.060> of<00:04:27.180> this

really like how it looks this way the

00:05:37.540 --> 00:06:11.369 
really like how it looks this way the
preferred<00:05:37.990> single<00:05:38.530> chain<00:05:40.650> it's<00:05:41.650> up<00:05:41.860> to<00:05:42.040> you

00:06:11.369 --> 00:06:11.379 

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:13.109 

some<00:06:11.889> people<00:06:12.189> liked<00:06:12.309> it<00:06:12.430> one<00:06:12.580> like<00:06:12.759> this<00:06:12.969> when

00:06:13.109 --> 00:06:13.119 
some people liked it one like this when

00:06:13.119 --> 00:06:15.480 
some people liked it one like this when
you<00:06:13.180> put<00:06:13.210> the<00:06:13.479> strap<00:06:13.749> at<00:06:13.930> the<00:06:14.020> bottom<00:06:14.469> and<00:06:14.710> it's

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
you put the strap at the bottom and it's

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.109 
you put the strap at the bottom and it's
just<00:06:15.639> the<00:06:15.789> chain<00:06:17.520> and<00:06:18.520> this<00:06:18.699> looks<00:06:18.909> pretty

00:06:19.109 --> 00:06:19.119 
just the chain and this looks pretty

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:28.870 
just the chain and this looks pretty
good<00:06:19.419> too

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.390 

I<00:06:28.970> actually<00:06:29.720> have<00:06:30.230> this<00:06:31.240> adjusted<00:06:32.240> to<00:06:32.660> the

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:33.400 
I actually have this adjusted to the

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.630 
I actually have this adjusted to the
longest<00:06:34.400> length<00:06:35.140> possible<00:06:36.520> something<00:06:37.520> that

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:37.640 
longest length possible something that

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.640 
longest length possible something that
would<00:06:37.790> be<00:06:37.940> nice<00:06:38.120> to<00:06:38.390> have<00:06:38.570> an<00:06:38.840> additional<00:06:39.080> hole

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.650 
would be nice to have an additional hole

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:44.920 
would be nice to have an additional hole
here<00:06:40.070> so<00:06:40.690> you<00:06:41.690> can<00:06:41.900> put<00:06:42.860> it<00:06:42.980> over<00:06:43.130> this<00:06:43.930> ball

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:44.930

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:50.030 
can even put it here and so make it even

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.630 
can even put it here and so make it even
longer<00:06:50.330> beginning<00:06:51.140> when<00:06:52.130> this<00:06:52.190> bike<00:06:52.430> can

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:52.640 
longer beginning when this bike can

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.900 
longer beginning when this bike can
stand<00:06:52.970> to<00:06:53.090> have<00:06:53.210> a<00:06:53.240> longer<00:06:53.690> strap<00:06:53.990> so<00:06:54.290> that

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:54.910 
stand to have a longer strap so that

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:57.130
