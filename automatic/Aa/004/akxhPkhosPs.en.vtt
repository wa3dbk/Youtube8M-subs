00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.620
 very good to all guys how are they 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.120
 the welcome united to the channel and good 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.000
 this time I bring you a new chapter of 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.950
 aliens chapter 6 scripts I tell you had 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.259
 very much desire to return with this 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.879
 series just like yes we are here but 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.890
 good before you start with the video os 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:20.210
 I leave while I'm here signing the 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.440
 Two players of the new team in brazil 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.360
 I wanted to tell you that from now on 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.670
 in the description you are going to have a 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.280
 coin page without new sponsor 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.690
 goofy to coin the truth very cheaply I 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.090
 I think the cheapest of all the 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.920
 pages that you know and also with the 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.290
 school code for 5 percent of 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.010
 stories that I think you're already going 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.230
 buying 57 million but well that's not 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.680
 is what I wanted to say in this video like this 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.540
 that we are going to start more or less good 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.460
 I also wanted to tell you that I tried the 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.890
 Tony and I liked a lot what 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.899
 happens is that of course the equipment that I have is 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.579
 of silver and maybe it's not the same 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.890
 that a golden team but I like it 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.100
 very much, I think it's not, but not 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.330
 he lost no match so good the 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.910
 first match 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.910
 well if not after this one over there 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.790
 is there is eye eye sturridge 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.610
 I do not have the reaction because I do not 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.890
 but I can assure you that I stayed a 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:23.580
 little cry or anything you know because I 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.580
 I was like saying this 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.980
 something like that so good now yes 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.860
 we go with the first game that I know that 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.090
 you 're really looking forward to it, I'm bringing ties 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.580
 one is also the one that I put the 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.500
 equipment and is blue and white and also 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.440
 I liked the second chelsea who 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.000
 I will put the first match well 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.860
 was against a team that had the 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.440
 pretty steaming front soldier 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.520
 slow to work that happens I read already red and 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.350
 red and our line you have to fly your 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:55.970
 really good goal to start this 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:58.250
 chapter maikon leite there will be eye eye 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.009
 maicon bicycle and that makes eye the base 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.899
 and line that is marked to maicon and with lasso 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.570
 I really like that kind of 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:08.420
 Vaseline and let's go eye with Roger in 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.130
 your life that is going to throw eye is not going it 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.800
 to pass to secure the goal 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.020
 there is the first goal and todd minute 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.850
 90 already practically when the party 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.100
 had to put a 30 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.080
 I think it's just so good we go 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.750
 to go now so if second party 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:27.000
 touches us against 15 g 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.860
 the shield the barça and like this if this one 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.930
 yes you have better equipment by removing the 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.330
 left side has much better 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.850
 team that the before and will know how 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.000
 in that 24 minute central lava from the 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.400
 corner how is it going to come back up there is going to 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.220
 bust the goal and die eye eye 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.200
 marcelino there today penalty I 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.240
 I've seen it and not good too 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.630
 to shoot with elton and elton who will do 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:54.209
 I made the fool to put it there was goal 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.010
 and todd minute 34 we do in a 1 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.880
 will come back again it will center but 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.920
 this time rasa and eye another golazo no other 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.390
 goal equal to that of before that yes the 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.220
 defense you see that so there could be 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.600
 done more and there they puncture me and I 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.570
 they take out red that I shit on everything 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.500
 and that is going to be done sign to be is one 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:19.819
 for not going to throw it away but there it is 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:23.510
 that minute 80 half bad the party 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:26.689
 there is at minute 81 that is, we are 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.730
 already in the shit lost matches 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:31.519
 quiet maikon leite is going to do this 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.769
 delicatessen and how it is not going to nail or 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:36.349
 Maicon loop but this is not going to be 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:38.769
 just that but practically after 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:41.180
 to put that heart also minute 84 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.639
 let's take this play that we 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.919
 leave the opponent here let's see how it 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:47.569
 we take it out we're going to pass the speedboat 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:49.790
 Alan who is going to do it is going to happen to 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:53.000
 elton elton what to do goes away one goes away 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:56.209
 from 2000 to there are three eyes what a great 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.280
 elton with the left as it did not rise good and 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.639
 you will see now the repetition as I 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.230
 He left that dive and as he does not define 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:06.169
 We already have three tickets 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.569
 with the whole of one before another penalty and 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:09.430
 this one now 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:11.469
 we have to put five with him already 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.420
 we also have two goals 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:16.750
 skills so let's see what we 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.519
 depara this last game as it is now 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.440
 so if I put on the kit of the 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.549
 betis and what was going to happen and let's see 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.549
 let's go down to second 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.090
 there it is we are going to see the rival that team 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.430
 I had this equipment because I had neymar 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.680
 I just think that remarkable is 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.030
 that although it is true that neither 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.759
 had liked the game we are going to 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.800
 put this goal with maicon de caño and 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:41.110
 the goal, that is, how to put body and 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.789
 practically with how small it is 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.379
 because I should not have a body that 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:46.300
 now you see with the body and as not 

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:47.650
 define from there the little tube and then the 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.479
 slave for the stick 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.849
 you must know the tom that he is going to do or was 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:53.710
 elton eye of the Turk and only test in 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:56.050
 that he will hear that he will eat and the goalkeeper 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.210
 that yes that has been eaten we go to 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.090
 done the plane we see in the repetition 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.699
 again very work teaspoon that takes 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.590
 and even until his house we go and good and 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:07.840
 practically at the end of the game that 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.810
 he went from outside the area that goal 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.909
 alan please what alan's great goal is 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.469
 jazz the same in the cards look at guys yo 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:16.690
 I hope you liked the video 

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:19.319

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.319
 goodbye
