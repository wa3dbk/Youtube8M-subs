00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.990 
we'll see it looks like they're just
gonna<00:00:39.480> expect<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.170> start<00:00:40.579> yep<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.760> have

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
gonna expect that to start yep I have

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.410 
gonna expect that to start yep I have
not<00:00:42.180> seen<00:00:42.660> ex<00:00:42.930> back<00:00:43.309> so<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.640> don't<00:00:44.969> know<00:00:45.210> I'm

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
not seen ex back so I don't know I'm

not seen ex back so I don't know I'm
just<00:00:45.450> gonna<00:00:45.660> go<00:00:45.780> smoother<00:00:46.140> if<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.530> was<00:00:46.649> in<00:00:46.739> this

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
just gonna go smoother if I was in this

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.290 
just gonna go smoother if I was in this
tournament<00:00:47.070> looks<00:00:47.399> like<00:00:47.520> Pippi<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.850> coin<00:00:48.090> toss

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
tournament looks like Pippi a coin toss

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.500 
tournament looks like Pippi a coin toss
every<00:00:48.690> runway<00:00:49.079> yeah<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.460> like<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.120> other<00:00:51.270> rule

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
every runway yeah I like the other rule

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.389 
every runway yeah I like the other rule
a<00:00:51.539> little<00:00:51.870> better<00:00:52.050> but<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.680> rule<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:52.980> safer<00:00:53.309> I

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
a little better but this rule is safer I

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.799 
a little better but this rule is safer I
guess<00:00:53.610> you're<00:00:53.789> not<00:00:53.879> expect<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.360> was<00:00:54.420> kind<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.719> a

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
guess you're not expect I was kind of a

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.479 
guess you're not expect I was kind of a
happy<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.350> would<00:00:55.559> probably<00:00:55.710> blow<00:00:56.010> myself<00:00:56.190> up

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
happy I would probably blow myself up

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.709 
happy I would probably blow myself up
doing<00:00:56.730> an<00:00:56.820> x<00:00:56.940> factor<00:00:57.000> but<00:00:57.270> i<00:00:57.360> rather<00:00:57.510> do<00:00:57.690> that

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
doing an x factor but i rather do that

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.660 
doing an x factor but i rather do that
but<00:00:58.020> not<00:00:58.140> have<00:00:58.289> any<00:00:58.500> sort<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.829> game<00:00:59.129> i<00:00:59.430> mean<00:00:59.579> i

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
but not have any sort of game i mean i

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.580 
but not have any sort of game i mean i
would<00:00:59.760> just<00:00:59.850> be<00:00:59.940> coming<00:01:00.210> back<00:01:00.390> it's<00:01:00.930> stupid<00:01:01.289> I

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
would just be coming back it's stupid I

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.250 
would just be coming back it's stupid I
actually<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.550> told<00:01:02.910> interest<00:01:03.239> Chris<00:01:03.629> matrix

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
actually I told interest Chris matrix

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.160 
actually I told interest Chris matrix
III<00:01:05.040> think<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:06.299> rules<00:01:06.570> are<00:01:06.750> an<00:01:06.869> interesting

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
III think the rules are an interesting

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.230 
III think the rules are an interesting
start<00:01:07.650> we'll<00:01:08.070> see<00:01:08.280> like<00:01:08.430> what<00:01:08.580> comes<00:01:08.820> with<00:01:09.210> the

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
start we'll see like what comes with the

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.880 
start we'll see like what comes with the
final<00:01:09.659> result<00:01:09.750> but<00:01:10.080> i<00:01:10.140> think<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.530> they<00:01:10.680> make

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
final result but i think that they make

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.350 
final result but i think that they make
up<00:01:11.100> have<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.400> car<00:01:11.580> with<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.729> different<00:01:12.060> method

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
up have the car with a different method

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.280 
up have the car with a different method
in<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.780> end<00:01:12.960> yeah<00:01:13.470> i<00:01:13.950> hope<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.960> something<00:01:15.960> a

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
in the end yeah i hope so something a

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.399 
in the end yeah i hope so something a
tournament<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.189> named<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.790> uh<00:01:18.170> wasn't<00:01:19.170> so

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
tournament is named that uh wasn't so

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.630 
tournament is named that uh wasn't so
convoluted<00:01:19.710> i<00:01:20.040> would<00:01:20.159> definitely<00:01:20.369> be<00:01:20.549> in

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
convoluted i would definitely be in

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.560 
convoluted i would definitely be in
there

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
there

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.350 
there
oh<00:01:21.830> but<00:01:22.830> Omni<00:01:23.430> side<00:01:23.640> showing<00:01:23.940> off<00:01:24.180> those

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
oh but Omni side showing off those
