00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.530
 and well now let's prepare another 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.080
 example of diet lunch plate of 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.000
 person here the blocks would be 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.010
 present as follows we are going to 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.070
 make a sautéed mushrooms 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.689
 eggplant and prawns the blocks the 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.300
 protein is not going to cut the shrimp 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.620
 the carbohydrate the whole vegetable the 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.450
 onion the mushroom the eggplant 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.490
 and then the dessert that we're going to put a 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.260
 piece of fruit and fats where 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.270
 would be the fats in this dish then 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.580
 it would be the oil that we are going to use 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.950
 to sauté some of the vegetables 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.090
 all because the eggplant is not going to 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.400
 do with the oil we will do better 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.920
 grilled because the eggplant also 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.660
 It is very porous and knew a lot about the oil and 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.610
 we are not interested so well let's go 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.920
 start cutting a little onion 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.790
 the onion is important that we had 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.470
 by water first to not help now the 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.710
 eggplant we take off 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.190
 this piece 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.190
 Y 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.770
 A) Yes 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.350
 If the eggplant will put the 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.210
 we are going to submerge in milk so that it does not 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.369
 make us dark so that we are not 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.070
 oxidize while we prepare the rest 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.320
 of the dishes is worth so here the 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.689
 we put a little in important soaking 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.579
 the mushrooms clean them with a 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:27.670
 wet washcloth with napkin 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:30.630
 moistened so we take everything well 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.140
 what is the grit that may have 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.140
 we are here 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.270
 Well, we already have everything here 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.490
 minced so let's put first 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.149
 the garlic with the onion in a pan 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.280
 we're going to water it and then we're going to 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.049
 saute also the eggplant with 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.700
 champignon the mushroom we are not going to 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.929
 let's add it to the aubergine 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.850
 until the Valencian does not have a 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:54.829
 color a little bit is worth it so 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.900
 we started first putting here in the 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:02:02.940
 oil in the small pan 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.940
 with garlic and onion 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:26.480
 the fire is still here 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.060
 and here we are going to put the eggplant 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.780
 in this pan that does not carry oil 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.780
 only 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.220
 the milk from before 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.750
 put the aubergines in the milk the 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.239
 soaking we have approached well but 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.860
 there is always a little bit more 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.750
 so that it does not dry we put the 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.540
 eggplant and let's put an executive 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.420
 of salt before and then we keep adding 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:00.330
 Salt when we put the mushrooms 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:05.300
 about parsley 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.300
 and a little bit of tarragon too 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.330
 let's wait a little bit for the 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.480
 eggplant show us the color that 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.250
 we want to make the good dish 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.680
 we already have the color of the eggplant 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.920
 what we want to achieve and now we are going to 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.090
 add the mushroom add the 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:27.640
 mushroom 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.640
 and we also add here 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.120
 the oil the onion that are already 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.780
 practically done then campiño 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.780
 has in a few minutes it gets 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.780
 land 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:45.290
 here we are going to add also 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.290
 the prawns 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.200
 and we're going to put a little bit of salt 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.200
 taste 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.230
 a little more 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:05.780
 and so too 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.780
 because they have pepper 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:13.410
 and we leave it for about 4 minutes 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.510
 more or less when we see that it is already 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.519
 putting tender good well here we have 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.860
 the finished dish this sauteed from 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.269
 vegetables and prawns that we have not 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.220
 done like this in this way helping us 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.710
 timbal to put it more prettier more 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.390
 decorative and for dessert we have the duo of 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.650
 kiwi and apple 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.650
