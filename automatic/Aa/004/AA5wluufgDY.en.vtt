00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:19.970

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:23.810
 some me so when I solved it 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:26.779
 interview you I started from the 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:30.110
 lowliest employees by some for 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:32.119
 more people the portela did not know that 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.700
 did not know what your question that 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.520
 Do you want to know about Natal that many? 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.380
 people in the most humble and inclusive 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.940
 here I put it I wrote but let's go 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.210
 try to explain to you 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.910
 they want to know the following is us 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.640
 we know that christmas jesus rebirth 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:53.510
 all this is biblical this is historical but 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:58.550
 in fact people ask that 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:01.850
 happened the two if it happened that 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:05.630
 found two when you tell it to b 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:08.270
 abc will be too much trouble when 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.880
 You come back for you, bc, more always. 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.859
 each tale has a final contract of 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.560
 bills where the truth is 

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:18.109
 so you are clear from the point of view 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.389
 historical view this is just like the people 

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:23.450
 knows the story of Julius Caesar Japanese 

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:26.299
 good part there is no record 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.590
 of the exact date of our midst of Jesus is 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.909
 a story does not exist does not exist 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:34.399
 someone no Christian church no 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:37.130
 states without discussion that it was 25 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:39.530
 this is a symbolic date of the 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:44.060
 birth who then chose that date 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:46.459
 in the 4th century in the 4th century in Rome already 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.880
 there was a feast that the Romans 

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:51.950
 made it happen on the 25th 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.889
 December in celebration of this faith called 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.469
 invictus the invincible sun 

00:01:54.889 --> 00:02:00.920
 then as the party was a party was 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:02.719
 Family exchanging gifts in Junction 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.899
 your story in your story to be written 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:08.569
 the publisher had a party for a 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:11.569
 Persian divinity that currently to Iran 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.850
 this activity piece called a miter was 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.800
 a divinity that one had and that 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.860
 He blessed people so that winter 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:22.610
 did not settle and she was called 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.100
 sun avoid the invincible sun sure so much 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.970
 that is noticed that in the horoscope you have 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.080
 the sun and 12 signs right as in 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.470
 Christmas 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.100
 sometimes people at Christmas represent 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:40.310
 Jesus as the sun and the twelve apostles is 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:42.920
 just as you have in Yahweh's Judaism and 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.640
 the 12 tribes of israel 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:49.190
 just like you have a year 1 12 months and 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.100
 so because the 12 he has a 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:56.290
 strong symbology in antiquity and 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:58.340
 December for its month ending the year 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.739
 means that it has been chosen as 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.410
 the one where Jesus was born but 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.050
 no the cabin stays cancun 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.610
 if you look at those who had 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.600
 Belief in Rome 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:14.600
 there in the Roman world two thousand years ago there 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.660
 in the Roman world it was believed that Jesus 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.090
 there was born near December but 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.400
 had not given up until I'm going to do it because 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.100
 that if you had this idea if you did not have a 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.739
 date we choose a symbolic date 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.269
 this happens sometimes in a couple can 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.549
 It's just that you do not remember the day 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.400
 She started dating someone the exact day 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.030
 at 60 our day is going to be that 2 of 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.700
 April 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.970
 right then if you chose to match 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:44.570
 with the day we celebrate this great 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.610
 Unite party is pagan with birth of Jesus 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.510
 to say the following jesus is the sun 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.510
 invincible 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.360
 that is with him that the light comes again is 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.780
 which illuminates our trajectory in the 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.090
 our life and never the Christian churches 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.780
 they indicated the 25th of December 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.370
 therefore it is a symbolic date exists 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.650
 including some groups that 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:10.640
 do not think even December 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:12.739
 born because of the description that he 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.280
 lived in a manger from which he was 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:17.959
 placed in an unweighed moment as soon as 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.720
 born of poverty 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.580
 if it were December in the world of the hemisphere 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.250
 north in Palestine he had died of 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.950
 some raise the hypothesis that 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:32.150
 he was born between March and December to 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:34.520
 that the outfit was born out of the 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.160
 A place that we could feel more 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.410
 I want to remember things faith does not depend on 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:43.310
 disability or any of that if someone 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:45.320
 believe is because he believes the faith 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.050
 time that beautiful word faith is 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:51.740
 unlikely it is not impossible 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.419
 The unlikely faith I can not prove is well 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.530
 likely what I can not prove 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.690
 impossible what I'm saying 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:00.140
 that does not exist so I'll tell you 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:02.720
 one thing December 25th is the birthday 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:05.050
 of Jesus I say is unlikely but it is not 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.050
 impossible
