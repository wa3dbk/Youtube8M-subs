00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.089
 in him so after writing and

 jorgillo gladly answer them 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:56.890
 the questions of the topics that make us 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.940
 especially if they are related to the subject 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.040
 of the metabolism that is our 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.000
 specialty 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:06.090
 this person tells me I 'm obese those 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.900
 290 days I've heard comments that yes 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.030
 I lift weights 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.460
 that fat disappears but not only that 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.680
 can increase muscle mass a little 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.720
 faster and eating obviously 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.700
 protein and carbohydrates is that true 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.980
 and you can burn fat and increase 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.230
 fast muscle mass if I lift 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:26.180
 well says active room and I answered the 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:31.580
 we are answering what he did 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:34.760
 the issue is that everything he believes 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.430
 movement of the muscles will burn 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.710
 fat but here before you drive this 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.380
 issue we have to handle the issue of 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.100
 lie the lie of the weight I go to the 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.100
 blackboard one moment 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:53.700
 Many people walk in anguish 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:56.219
 suffering with your weight problem 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.010
 I want to tell you that this is a great 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:02.620
 lie the weight is not the problem 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:05.080
 the weight of the body is nothing other than 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.330
 the force that makes the gravity of this 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.850
 planet where we are pulling the body 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.000
 down but the weight does not mean 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:16.500
 that is a problem of obesity weight 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.500
 and obesity are not the same thing 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:24.930
 The human body is composed of 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.930
 different things is made up of meat 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.560
 lots of water 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.560
 bones 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.560
 grease 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.340
 and these compounds all those that have 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:40.349
 because they also have nerves 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.260
 all the other compounds all these 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:46.319
 compounds have different weight of all 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.980
 these that is here the lightest 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.659
 it is of all that less it weighs in the fat 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.150
 that's the reason why a person 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:56.060
 good chubby floats on the water people 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.950
 well skinny does not float well they go for the 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.720
 background but well chubby people 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.580
 it floats indeed the divers well 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.239
 chubby have to put some weights very 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.620
 large very heavy lead so that 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.000
 they can go down because if they do not stay 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.470
 floating up can not go down below 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.650
 of the water 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:16.270
 because the fat is light then the 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.569
 question is if a person does weights 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.810
 weights exercises 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:25.240
 which are resistance exercises if that 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:28.060
 person is going to burn fat 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.959
 the answer is yes 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:34.360
 when you exercise weights 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:37.270
 two things happen one is that it increases the 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.870
 muscle that muscle mass that 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:44.640
 obviously will increase the weight 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.640
 if it increases the muscles 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:52.730
 increase the weight because a person what 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.320
 what else weighs in the body in the bones 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.870
 but the second thing that weighs the most in 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.870
 proportion in the muscles for example 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.480
 is this gentleman to the nord schwarzenegger who 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.830
 was governor of california a 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.380
 famous bodybuilder 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.420
 a gentleman well thought indeed the lord 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.950
 You are overweight because you have 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.650
 overweight because it weighs more than any 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.810
 man of that stature but if he does not have 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.630
 obesity what you have is excess 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.570
 muscle a lot muscle so you do 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.880
 weights the weights lift the musculature 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.420
 and the musculature of lift the weight does not 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.020
 go away is the weight to lose weight 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:32.280
 because it's going to fail because of how you do 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.440
 Weights exercises will increase the 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.590
 muscle mass muscle mass 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.960
 muscles weigh two and a half times more than 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.490
 the fat therefore when you believe 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.680
 a muscle mass 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.850
 you are gaining weight what 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.220
 happens that it's going to get thinner 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:50.250
 because then those muscles eat 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:54.150
 the fat is used as fuel 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:56.490
 that if anyone do weights one goes to 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.470
 reduce the fat you're going to slim down you 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.800
 what are you going 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.810
 do not make the mistake of doing weights and 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.740
 to think all day because 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:09.050
 then you will end up very disappointed 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.759
 go to do weights every day do 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.440
 his weight training that comes super 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:13.849
 good to burn fat and to 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.090
 toning the body was to put it 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:20.599
 nice and healthy and strong but not 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:25.550
 followed by the weight go for the size 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:28.400
 of clothes carving clothes this is the truth 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.570
 if you are doing a 2-for-1 diet 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.830
 3 for 1 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.450
 is following what it says in the book 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.820
 power of metabolism and be giving 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:38.540
 weights you should get more and more 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:40.600
 slimmer thin or it has to 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:44.320
 have less and less fat and more muscle 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:46.510
 that's health do not look at it 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.670
 the body weight because it's going to 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.530
 cheat you have to measure it by the 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:54.460
 clothing size maybe for example a 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:56.110
 man what do I know I have a waist 42 and 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.569
 continues to reduce and has a 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.879
 waist 34 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:03.089
 and a waistband as well as a 

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:06.129
 Bodybuilder but it's pure muscle 

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:09.580
 so looked at by the size of clothes the 

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:11.439
 clothing does not lie and does not forgive the dumb 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.599
 can cheat you but the clothes do not lie 

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:18.360
 and do not forgive this I share with 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:18.360
 you because the truth always triumphs
