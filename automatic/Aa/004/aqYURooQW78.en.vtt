second<00:02:10.379> of<00:02:10.440> which<00:02:10.470> is<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.520> creation<00:02:11.940> of

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
second of which is that the creation of

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.700 
second of which is that the creation of
awesome<00:02:12.390> technology

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
awesome technology

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.620 
awesome technology
would<00:02:13.890> come<00:02:14.130> from<00:02:14.310> this<00:02:14.490> exploration<00:02:14.910> would

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
would come from this exploration would

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.960 
would come from this exploration would
benefit<00:02:16.050> those<00:02:16.470> of<00:02:16.650> us<00:02:16.740> here<00:02:16.920> on<00:02:17.040> earth<00:02:17.070> even

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
benefit those of us here on earth even

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.940 
benefit those of us here on earth even
our<00:02:18.060> economy<00:02:18.600> much<00:02:18.840> like<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.230> Apollo<00:02:19.500> mission

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
our economy much like the Apollo mission

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.700 
our economy much like the Apollo mission
did<00:02:20.160> and<00:02:20.340> thirdly<00:02:21.120> pumping<00:02:22.110> up<00:02:22.230> this<00:02:22.410> the

did and thirdly pumping up this the
space<00:02:22.950> program<00:02:23.220> would<00:02:23.760> inspire<00:02:24.150> youth<00:02:24.540> to

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
space program would inspire youth to

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.980 
space program would inspire youth to
think<00:02:26.460> more<00:02:26.670> about<00:02:26.730> science<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.720> engineering

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
think more about science and engineering

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.170 
think more about science and engineering
and<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:29.010> maybe<00:02:29.220> gravitate<00:02:29.490> toward<00:02:30.030> those

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
and and maybe gravitate toward those

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.020 
and and maybe gravitate toward those
jobs<00:02:30.510> but<00:02:31.260> needless<00:02:31.740> to<00:02:32.040> say<00:02:32.160> a<00:02:32.190> lot<00:02:32.550> of<00:02:32.790> good

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
jobs but needless to say a lot of good

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.420 
jobs but needless to say a lot of good
and<00:02:33.240> profitable<00:02:33.720> technology<00:02:34.500> comes<00:02:34.770> out<00:02:35.010> of

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
and profitable technology comes out of

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.080 
and profitable technology comes out of
NASA<00:02:35.760> such<00:02:36.600> as<00:02:36.870> memory<00:02:37.500> foam<00:02:37.860> nano<00:02:38.370> ceramics

NASA such as memory foam nano ceramics

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.940 
NASA such as memory foam nano ceramics
like<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.870> plastics<00:02:40.440> that<00:02:40.650> we<00:02:40.740> use<00:02:40.920> for

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
like the plastics that we use for

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.500 
like the plastics that we use for

robotics and computer sciences have

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.460 
robotics and computer sciences have
improved<00:02:56.340> greatly<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.480> we<00:02:58.110> also<00:02:58.230> need<00:02:58.440> to

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
improved greatly and we also need to

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.100 
improved greatly and we also need to
remember<00:02:58.800> that<00:02:58.980> 1.5<00:02:59.790> billion<00:03:00.090> it<00:03:00.480> sounds<00:03:01.020> like

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
remember that 1.5 billion it sounds like

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.260 
remember that 1.5 billion it sounds like
a<00:03:01.170> lot<00:03:01.440> but<00:03:01.590> it's<00:03:01.740> actually<00:03:01.920> a<00:03:02.370> very<00:03:02.850> very

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
a lot but it's actually a very very

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.010 
a lot but it's actually a very very
small<00:03:03.450> amount<00:03:03.930> of<00:03:04.140> our<00:03:04.590> budget<00:03:05.280> it's<00:03:05.730> actually

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
small amount of our budget it's actually

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.620 
small amount of our budget it's actually
0.5%<00:03:07.020> of<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.920> federal<00:03:08.250> budget<00:03:08.280> I<00:03:08.790> think<00:03:09.330> scrap

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
0.5% of the federal budget I think scrap

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.510 
0.5% of the federal budget I think scrap
it<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:09.840> just<00:03:10.110> like<00:03:10.290> one<00:03:10.590> military<00:03:11.190> initiative

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
it and just like one military initiative

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.010 
it and just like one military initiative
would<00:03:11.790> be<00:03:11.910> able<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.120> pay<00:03:12.270> for<00:03:12.480> this<00:03:12.570> well

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
would be able to pay for this well

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.040 
would be able to pay for this well
considering<00:03:13.740> how<00:03:14.040> much<00:03:14.280> of<00:03:14.670> then<00:03:15.540> you<00:03:15.900> could

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
considering how much of then you could

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.990 
considering how much of then you could
take<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.500> federal<00:03:17.010> defense<00:03:17.340> budget

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
take the federal defense budget

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.420 
take the federal defense budget
specifically<00:03:18.630> is<00:03:18.810> sort<00:03:19.470> of<00:03:19.530> like<00:03:19.710> wasted

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
specifically is sort of like wasted

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.870 
specifically is sort of like wasted
money<00:03:20.730> is<00:03:21.000> money<00:03:21.840> that<00:03:22.020> is<00:03:22.320> spent<00:03:22.590> more<00:03:23.580> wisely

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
money is money that is spent more wisely

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.670 
money is money that is spent more wisely
say<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.630> least<00:03:24.810> we<00:03:25.110> could<00:03:25.260> talk<00:03:25.410> for<00:03:25.560> another

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
say the least we could talk for another

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.410 
say the least we could talk for another
10<00:03:25.950> minutes<00:03:25.980> 10<00:03:26.610> minutes<00:03:26.700> about<00:03:26.940> no<00:03:27.240> bid

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
10 minutes 10 minutes about no bid

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.940 
10 minutes 10 minutes about no bid
contracts<00:03:27.960> and<00:03:28.170> what<00:03:28.380> a<00:03:28.410> waste<00:03:28.680> of<00:03:28.890> money

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
contracts and what a waste of money

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.370 
contracts and what a waste of money
those<00:03:29.340> are<00:03:29.670> and<00:03:29.970> all<00:03:30.390> the<00:03:30.540> government<00:03:31.200> red

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
those are and all the government red

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.170 
those are and all the government red
tape<00:03:31.410> and<00:03:31.680> bureaucracy<00:03:32.070> that<00:03:32.460> wastes<00:03:33.000> money

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
tape and bureaucracy that wastes money

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.910 
tape and bureaucracy that wastes money
both<00:03:33.840> home<00:03:34.170> and<00:03:34.200> abroad<00:03:34.470> so<00:03:35.160> well<00:03:35.760> I<00:03:35.790> think<00:03:36.180> the

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
both home and abroad so well I think the

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.870 
both home and abroad so well I think the
beautiful<00:03:37.920> thing<00:03:38.100> about<00:03:38.130> this<00:03:38.460> is<00:03:38.520> that<00:03:38.670> it

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
beautiful thing about this is that it

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.420 
beautiful thing about this is that it
gives<00:03:39.060> us<00:03:39.270> back<00:03:39.540> so<00:03:39.900> much<00:03:40.320> by<00:03:40.920> dropping<00:03:41.340> that

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
gives us back so much by dropping that

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.130 
gives us back so much by dropping that
money<00:03:41.670> and<00:03:41.850> it<00:03:41.940> is<00:03:42.090> an<00:03:42.210> investment<00:03:42.630> i<00:03:42.870> believe

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
money and it is an investment i believe

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.800 
money and it is an investment i believe
and<00:03:43.380> it<00:03:43.770> is<00:03:44.220> highly<00:03:44.820> profitable<00:03:45.060> not<00:03:45.540> just

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
and it is highly profitable not just

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.070 
and it is highly profitable not just
monetarily<00:03:46.740> but<00:03:46.980> also<00:03:47.490> in<00:03:48.210> our<00:03:48.390> progression

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
monetarily but also in our progression

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.620 
monetarily but also in our progression
as<00:03:49.380> human<00:03:49.980> beings<00:03:50.010> that<00:03:50.820> don't<00:03:51.210> forget<00:03:51.360> about

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
as human beings that don't forget about

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.140 
as human beings that don't forget about
that<00:03:51.780> we're<00:03:52.410> thinking<00:03:52.560> about<00:03:53.150> putting

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
that we're thinking about putting

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.330 
that we're thinking about putting
another<00:03:54.480> Rover<00:03:54.900> much<00:03:55.230> like<00:03:55.470> curiosity<00:03:56.160> on

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
another Rover much like curiosity on

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.100 
another Rover much like curiosity on
Europa<00:03:56.970> which<00:03:57.120> is<00:03:57.270> one<00:03:57.420> of<00:03:57.450> Jupiter's<00:03:57.900> moons

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
Europa which is one of Jupiter's moons

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.770 
Europa which is one of Jupiter's moons
and<00:03:58.620> a<00:03:59.400> very<00:03:59.700> likely<00:04:00.000> candidate<00:04:00.540> to<00:04:00.570> be

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
and a very likely candidate to be

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.750 
and a very likely candidate to be
hospitable<00:04:01.200> to<00:04:01.320> life<00:04:01.440> it's<00:04:01.890> there's<00:04:02.490> a<00:04:02.550> lot<00:04:02.730> of

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
hospitable to life it's there's a lot of

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.910 
hospitable to life it's there's a lot of
water<00:04:03.090> under<00:04:03.270> an<00:04:03.630> ice<00:04:03.870> layer<00:04:04.170> on<00:04:04.410> that<00:04:04.740> moon

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
water under an ice layer on that moon

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.030 
water under an ice layer on that moon
and<00:04:05.160> we're<00:04:06.000> thinking<00:04:06.480> well<00:04:07.320> there's<00:04:07.650> evidence

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
and we're thinking well there's evidence
