00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
potential and for right now I can't

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.889 
potential and for right now I can't
really<00:00:46.920> say<00:00:47.340> if<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.789> or<00:00:48.059> isn't<00:00:48.210> because<00:00:48.870> I

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
really say if it is or isn't because I

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.819 
really say if it is or isn't because I
haven't<00:00:49.469> seen<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:50.360> conclusion<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.829> plastic

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
memories but at the moment I understand

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.560 
memories but at the moment I understand
why<00:00:55.530> some<00:00:55.920> are<00:00:56.219> kind<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.610> conflicted<00:00:57.239> with<00:00:57.390> the

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
why some are kind of conflicted with the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.209 
why some are kind of conflicted with the
series<00:00:57.930> because<00:00:58.350> right<00:00:58.559> now<00:00:58.710> they<00:00:58.920> don't<00:00:59.010> know

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
series because right now they don't know

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.830 
series because right now they don't know
what<00:00:59.399> direction<00:00:59.730> this<00:01:00.059> series<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.480> gonna<00:01:00.570> go

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
what direction this series is gonna go

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.420 
what direction this series is gonna go
especially<00:01:01.350> with<00:01:01.469> how<00:01:01.649> it's<00:01:01.890> been<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.129> mean

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
especially with how it's been I mean

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.520 
especially with how it's been I mean
usually<00:01:02.760> when<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.480> comes<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.840> anime<00:01:04.260> series

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
usually when it comes to anime series

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.109 
usually when it comes to anime series
like<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.100> there's<00:01:05.790> gonna<00:01:05.909> be<00:01:06.090> a

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
like this there's gonna be a

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.060 
like this there's gonna be a
happy-go-lucky<00:01:06.420> ending<00:01:07.170> but<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.530> depends<00:01:07.950> on

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
happy-go-lucky ending but it depends on

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.160 
happy-go-lucky ending but it depends on
the<00:01:08.189> execution<00:01:08.850> if<00:01:08.970> it's<00:01:09.150> good<00:01:09.390> or<00:01:09.540> not<00:01:09.570> but

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
the execution if it's good or not but

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.109 
the execution if it's good or not but
the<00:01:10.290> big<00:01:10.439> question<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.220> like<00:01:11.400> well<00:01:11.970> all

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
the big question is is like well all

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.210 
the big question is is like well all
these<00:01:12.270> themes<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:13.409> we'll<00:01:13.500> all<00:01:13.650> these<00:01:13.799> buildup

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
these themes and we'll all these buildup

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.030 
these themes and we'll all these buildup
episodes<00:01:14.670> with<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.060> know<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.299> potential<00:01:15.600> has

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
episodes with you know the potential has

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.950 
episodes with you know the potential has
will<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.250> be<00:01:17.400> used<00:01:17.670> properly<00:01:18.000> especially<00:01:18.540> with

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
will it be used properly especially with

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.780 
will it be used properly especially with
the<00:01:19.080> conclusion<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.830> next<00:01:20.369> week's<00:01:20.549> episode

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
the conclusion of next week's episode

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.550 
the conclusion of next week's episode
suppose<00:01:21.450> if<00:01:21.659> I'm<00:01:21.810> correct<00:01:21.960> next<00:01:22.320> week<00:01:22.439> is

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
suppose if I'm correct next week is

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.530 
suppose if I'm correct next week is
gonna<00:01:22.650> be<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.979> final<00:01:23.159> episode<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.299> series

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
gonna be the final episode of the series

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.080 
gonna be the final episode of the series
and<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.680> will<00:01:25.860> determine<00:01:26.250> if<00:01:26.729> this

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
and so that will determine if this

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.660 
and so that will determine if this
series<00:01:27.360> lived<00:01:28.229> up<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.860> potential<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.460> had

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
series lived up to the potential it had

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.789 
series lived up to the potential it had
well<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.180> will<00:01:30.659> make<00:01:30.810> sure<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.049> be<00:01:31.229> honest<00:01:31.560> next

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
well I will make sure to be honest next

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.740 
well I will make sure to be honest next
wait<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.040> see<00:01:32.189> exactly<00:01:32.640> how<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:32.909> is<00:01:33.150> but<00:01:33.450> at<00:01:33.630> the

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
wait to see exactly how it is but at the

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.929 
wait to see exactly how it is but at the
moment<00:01:34.079> though<00:01:34.259> I'm<00:01:34.770> just<00:01:34.979> writing<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.700> for

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
moment though I'm just writing it for

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.609 
moment though I'm just writing it for
the<00:01:36.439> emotions<00:01:37.439> because<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:37.950> mean<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.460> series

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
the emotions because I mean the series

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.899 
the emotions because I mean the series
it's<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.710> series<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.369> know<00:01:41.579> what<00:01:41.790> you're

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
it's a series that you know what you're

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.460 
it's a series that you know what you're
getting<00:01:42.030> into<00:01:42.210> right<00:01:42.420> from<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.869> start<00:01:43.049> like<00:01:43.229> I

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
getting into right from the start like I

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.350 
getting into right from the start like I
think<00:01:43.590> all<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:43.979> us<00:01:44.159> when<00:01:44.490> we<00:01:44.610> walked<00:01:44.880> into<00:01:45.210> this

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
think all of us when we walked into this

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.440 
think all of us when we walked into this
series<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:46.159> picked<00:01:47.159> by<00:01:47.280> episode<00:01:47.700> 1<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.030> 2<00:01:48.060> or<00:01:48.270> 3

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
series I picked by episode 1 and 2 or 3

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.510 
series I picked by episode 1 and 2 or 3
probably<00:01:48.869> by<00:01:48.960> episode<00:01:49.320> 4<00:01:49.590> we<00:01:49.740> all<00:01:49.920> came<00:01:50.310> to

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
probably by episode 4 we all came to

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.160 
probably by episode 4 we all came to
terms<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.970> what<00:01:51.149> we<00:01:51.240> should<00:01:51.270> probably<00:01:51.570> expect

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
terms of what we should probably expect

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.200 
terms of what we should probably expect
from<00:01:52.439> this<00:01:52.619> series<00:01:52.890> from<00:01:53.310> when<00:01:53.549> we<00:01:53.700> got<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.119> the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.130 
from this series from when we got to the
ending<00:01:54.570> inclusion<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.750> think<00:01:57.750> if

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
ending inclusion and so I think if

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.959 
ending inclusion and so I think if
anyone<00:01:58.619> is<00:01:58.740> still<00:01:58.890> watching<00:01:59.369> at<00:01:59.490> this<00:01:59.640> point
