 nelson piquet formula world champion 

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:08.390
 1 for the second time Brazilian party in 

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:10.220
 kailane south africa 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.170
 party here also we accompany in 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.090
 the joy and the emotion of the 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.219
 relatives and friends that it was a decision 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.140
 difficult and had two points less 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.130
 that there was in post had to risk everything 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.449
 run with the heart drive with head 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:27.350
 When I first arrived on the globe, it was the year of the 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:33.680
 first title because I came in 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:35.149
 very end and I came hired joseph's 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.050
 sports director of the time armando 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:40.460
 director of the plant very much in 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.190
 also at work I had 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.190
 made in small bandeirantes formula 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.360
 steal took the edge overtaking also 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.160
 riccardo patrese and teammate 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.680
 who also did well in this early 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.079
 French jacques laffite 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.520
 had the same luck left the track and 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.520
 race on the second lap 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.510
 the title fight was even between 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.510
 small beyond pole and nr 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:14.970
 but was soon among the first two to 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:16.860
 told me he was in a hurry he got less than 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.890
 10 seconds in the boxes to change the 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.890
 tires 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.229
 was a very important year in things that 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.220
 came to happen 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.470
 the dispute is huge the pp that had had 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.170
 five guys with chances to be champion 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.860
 missing five races and the small 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.860
 last of them 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:49.230
 by the eighth position by the seventh position 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:51.810
 I found a zpe not only because there you will see 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:55.350
 nelson piquet from 1 to 1 leading one more 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.500
 missing nasty comment by nelson 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.500
 piquet 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.090
 this year 83 in africa 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.550
 The cool thing was that the pt that had it 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.380
 I needed to get in the room. 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.730
 provided the next one did not win the 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:16.800
 and the next and broke 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:20.820
 I do not remember how many rounds to 15 40 and 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.310
 pp mo sinned that the fatty white gordÃ£o 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.070
 who is the brave engineer they are 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.900
 was the year of the pit stop of the year that 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.240
 he without these two invent the pit stop 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.350
 at the grand prix of england in july 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.930
 out of 82 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.390
 it is impossible to think about a pilot during the 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.180
 middle of the race for the box not 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.100
 getting lost when you arrived at the end of 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.590
 pit stop year was already a reality that 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.530
 everyone did so more or less 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.020
 calculated the middle of the Brazil race 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.820
 pit stop everyone more or less in the 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.640
 kind of try to do some 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:57.030
 before or a little later and the piquet is 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.530
 This fat mother innovated again. 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.900
 they surprised everyone they 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.620
 they left with very little gas 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.230
 a race of 60 almost 70 laps in the 19 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.330
 they stopped 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.880
 nobody imagined it in the 19 they 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.010
 They stopped exchanging the pp that came out again. 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.560
 to run in eighth or ninth but 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.510
 knowing that they all have to stop 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.280
 so that's how he won with his foot in the 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.600
 back is something he would have gained 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.520
 race itself 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.320
 only as he did not need to win and 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.690
 ran to get third 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.360
 things got easier for you 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.810
 when there is business went to the pits and 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.180
 abandoned the race was practically the 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.269
 confirmation of the Brazilian title but 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.700
 still some scares that decrease the 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.920
 risk apparently a tactic to 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.780
 save the car but fell to second 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.690
 after the accident with bruno jacomelli 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.060
 patrese released after the smoke in the 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.030
 track and Niki Lauda not let stay 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.580
 Quietly the opposite happened and 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.740
 to fall to third but the 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.830
 luck helped because again 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:04.590
 lauda left patrese and crossed in 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:07.050
 first and relieved a little more and 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.600
 secured the third place, leaving 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.540
 james take second place 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.569
 the third place making four points 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.940
 who cashed the two difference 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:20.580
 and secured the second title 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.850
 formula 1 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.680
 at a time when formula 1 was more 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.200
 exciting than it is today that much more 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.780
 exceedances today it is hung from 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.479
 May upon technology 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:35.729
 so long as you do not lower the brakes 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:38.340
 of formula 1 does not depend so much on 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:40.110
 dynamic depression we will not have another 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.950
 much earlier, so it was a 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:47.970
 spectacle played in the small nicolau of there 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:51.690
 all alan jones roitman in all that 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:53.520
 they were fantastic catch- ups for a new champion 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.850
 of the world the Brazilian fans the team 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.350
 Brave made the party together 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.270
 everything happened exactly with a team 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.550
 scheduled and the party started at the moment 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:08.340
 of the banded verne of game pq 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:12.190
 and then the champion no longer control but 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:18.759
 very pleased that the championship has no 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:20.590
 nothing to speak of, nothing you always 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:21.190
 said that this is what you most wanted 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.229
 win 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.680
 there is the result of all this nelsi 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:25.680
