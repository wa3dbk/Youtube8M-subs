all covers it sounded better in my head

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.709 
all covers it sounded better in my head
and<00:00:36.750> then<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:36.960> came<00:00:37.079> out<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.500> was<00:00:37.530> like<00:00:37.800> oh

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
and then it came out and I was like oh

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.389 
and then it came out and I was like oh
but<00:00:39.719> he<00:00:39.809> has<00:00:39.989> highway<00:00:40.500> we<00:00:40.890> are<00:00:41.040> on<00:00:41.219> our<00:00:41.370> way

but he has highway we are on our way

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.490 
but he has highway we are on our way
there<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.450> really<00:00:42.660> need<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.899> work<00:00:43.050> out<00:00:43.260> when

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500

I'm vlogging to videotape a lot more
that<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:45.750> think<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.140> necessary<00:00:46.680> because<00:00:46.800> every

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
that I think is necessary because every

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.940 
that I think is necessary because every
time<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:47.430> don't<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:48.270> like<00:00:48.690> don't<00:00:49.110> have<00:00:49.379> enough<00:00:49.680> to

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
time I don't I like don't have enough to

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.750 
time I don't I like don't have enough to
make<00:00:50.100> anything<00:00:50.539> probably<00:00:51.539> shouldn't<00:00:51.989> do<00:00:52.110> that

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
make anything probably shouldn't do that

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.700 
make anything probably shouldn't do that

which<00:07:36.550> is<00:07:36.909> a<00:07:36.939> lot<00:07:37.239> harder<00:07:37.449> than<00:07:37.659> it<00:07:37.809> looks

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:38.050 
which is a lot harder than it looks

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:40.859 
which is a lot harder than it looks
apparently<00:07:38.679> because<00:07:39.099> I<00:07:39.369> see<00:07:39.610> these<00:07:40.149> walls<00:07:40.449> so
