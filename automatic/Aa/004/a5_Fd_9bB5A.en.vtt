00:07:34.209 --> 00:07:34.219 
feature that we all shared one of the

00:07:34.219 --> 00:07:35.740 
feature that we all shared one of the
things<00:07:34.340> about<00:07:34.490> the<00:07:34.969> future<00:07:35.270> that<00:07:35.389> we<00:07:35.479> have<00:07:35.599> is

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:35.750 
things about the future that we have is

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.659 
things about the future that we have is
that<00:07:35.900> whatever<00:07:36.380> we<00:07:36.620> focus<00:07:37.130> on<00:07:37.310> where<00:07:37.550> our

00:07:37.659 --> 00:07:37.669 
that whatever we focus on where our

00:07:37.669 --> 00:07:40.029 
that whatever we focus on where our
attention<00:07:38.090> goes<00:07:38.120> is<00:07:38.569> where<00:07:38.960> energy<00:07:39.139> flows<00:07:39.680> and

00:07:40.029 --> 00:07:40.039 
attention goes is where energy flows and

00:07:40.039 --> 00:07:42.730 
attention goes is where energy flows and
that's<00:07:40.520> what<00:07:40.699> grows<00:07:41.259> so<00:07:42.259> if<00:07:42.349> we<00:07:42.440> put<00:07:42.650> our

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:42.740 
that's what grows so if we put our

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.230 
that's what grows so if we put our
attention<00:07:43.130> on<00:07:43.219> solution<00:07:43.759> the<00:07:43.940> solution

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:44.240 
attention on solution the solution

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.510 
attention on solution the solution
magnifies<00:07:45.020> we<00:07:45.560> put<00:07:45.770> our<00:07:45.889> attention<00:07:45.949> on<00:07:46.340> all

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:46.520
