I can't see it so just jump jump and you
up<00:00:50.789> ok<00:00:53.750> so<00:00:54.750> I'm<00:00:54.840> guessing<00:00:55.110> if<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.469> fall<00:00:55.680> down<00:00:55.710> oh

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
up ok so I'm guessing if I fall down oh

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.119 
up ok so I'm guessing if I fall down oh
yeah<00:00:56.340> this<00:00:56.550> mob<00:00:56.789> stana<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.829> probably<00:00:58.829> guess

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
yeah this mob stana I probably guess

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.619 
yeah this mob stana I probably guess
that's<00:00:59.399> what<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.640> difficult<00:01:00.149> years<00:01:00.329> maybe

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
that's what the difficult years maybe

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.650 
that's what the difficult years maybe
maybe<00:01:01.289> they're<00:01:01.469> zombies<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:02.030> higher<00:01:03.030> damage<00:01:03.300> or

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
maybe they're zombies a higher damage or

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.350 
maybe they're zombies a higher damage or
things<00:01:03.870> like<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.460> see<00:01:05.460> just<00:01:05.640> press<00:01:05.850> shift<00:01:06.150> to

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
things like that see just press shift to

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.410 
things like that see just press shift to
stay<00:01:06.570> on<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.810> ladder<00:01:07.549> so<00:01:08.549> across<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.210> first

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
stay on the ladder so across the first

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.320 
stay on the ladder so across the first
section<00:01:09.720> that's<00:01:10.080> pretty<00:01:10.530> easy<00:01:11.090> and<00:01:12.090> these<00:01:12.270> are

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
section that's pretty easy and these are

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.660 
section that's pretty easy and these are
pressure<00:01:13.170> plated<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:13.890> guess<00:01:14.100> they<00:01:14.310> fall

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
pressure plated so I guess they fall

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.609 
pressure plated so I guess they fall
free<00:01:14.909> maybe<00:01:15.350> will<00:01:16.350> blow<00:01:16.920> up<00:01:17.070> or<00:01:17.369> shoot<00:01:17.580> arrows

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
yeah they fall free no I pull through

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.679 
yeah they fall free no I pull through
here<00:01:24.360> Oh<00:01:24.770> press<00:01:25.770> play<00:01:26.299> definitely<00:01:27.299> test<00:01:27.509> it
