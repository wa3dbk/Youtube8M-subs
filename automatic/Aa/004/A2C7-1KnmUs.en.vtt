00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.099
 when using without cable management for use 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.840
 80 plus gold gets its 13 and that 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.850
 Cable management makes us the trait 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.040

 on the back you will find one 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.940
 Overview of performance data and a 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.579
 Overview of the included cables in 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.149

 air letting in to the power supply 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.720
 through a funnel-shaped design 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.119
 also the air pressure inside increases 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.500
 running through the new 6 pin motor 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.500

 you can find a sign with everyone 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:37.500
 performance data and on the front page 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:41.430
 the fan grille with the power plug of 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.670
 the on off switch , we are now dedicated 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.130

 so should a power supply are processed 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.760
 Now to the cable 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.650
 because not removable wire harness on 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.810
 Power supply is the power supply for 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.300
 Mainboard is held together by it 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:13.140
 a cat cable tie 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:16.700
 the cable is sheathed and has 120 plus 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.700
 4 pin mainboard connection 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.110
 further you have two pci-express cables 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:27.030
 each with 2 6 2 pin connections 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:30.090
 to this comes the 4 p + 4 p cpu 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.430
 Power supply and a total of four cables 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.700
 for hard drives and other accessories 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.379
 Solved or fan control even if 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.209
 he should use a floppy is 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:42.349
 an appropriate connection cable with in 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.349
 scope of delivery included
