replace the back cover and you're ready
to<00:02:43.420> go<00:02:44.190> there's<00:02:45.190> one<00:02:45.450> bigger<00:02:46.450> issue<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:47.320> this

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
to go there's one bigger issue to this

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.260 
to go there's one bigger issue to this
case<00:02:47.770> and<00:02:48.900> I'm<00:02:49.900> sorry<00:02:50.250> it's<00:02:51.250> that<00:02:51.550> I<00:02:51.760> find

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
case and I'm sorry it's that I find

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.710 
case and I'm sorry it's that I find
sometimes<00:02:52.720> not<00:02:53.350> just<00:02:53.590> always<00:02:53.770> but<00:02:54.160> sometimes

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
sometimes not just always but sometimes

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.510 
sometimes not just always but sometimes
the<00:02:55.720> back<00:02:55.930> part<00:02:56.260> it's<00:02:56.530> really<00:02:56.950> hard<00:02:57.190> to<00:02:57.310> take

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
the back part it's really hard to take

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.550 
the back part it's really hard to take
off<00:02:57.730> this<00:02:58.210> is<00:02:58.390> an<00:02:58.510> advantage<00:02:58.840> because<00:02:59.200> you're

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
off this is an advantage because you're

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.220 
off this is an advantage because you're
not<00:02:59.740> afraid<00:03:00.040> of<00:03:00.360> losing<00:03:01.360> the<00:03:01.450> back<00:03:01.630> cover<00:03:01.930> it

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
not afraid of losing the back cover it

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.970 
not afraid of losing the back cover it
does<00:03:02.830> if<00:03:03.310> you<00:03:03.370> happens<00:03:04.300> to<00:03:04.540> drop<00:03:04.900> the<00:03:05.170> Nano<00:03:05.680> and

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
does if you happens to drop the Nano and

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.820 
does if you happens to drop the Nano and
this<00:03:06.940> is<00:03:07.060> good<00:03:07.300> but<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:08.170> moment<00:03:08.500> you<00:03:08.530> want<00:03:08.740> to

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
this is good but the moment you want to

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.470 
this is good but the moment you want to
take<00:03:08.950> out<00:03:09.160> because<00:03:09.490> you<00:03:09.610> want<00:03:09.850> to<00:03:09.910> feel<00:03:09.970> the

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
take out because you want to feel the

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.070 
take out because you want to feel the
real<00:03:10.690> faintness<00:03:11.110> of<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:12.040> Nano<00:03:12.250> ah<00:03:12.630> you<00:03:13.630> may

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
real faintness of the Nano ah you may

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.470 
real faintness of the Nano ah you may
not<00:03:14.320> like<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:15.100> fact<00:03:15.370> that<00:03:15.490> it's<00:03:15.580> so<00:03:15.970> hard<00:03:16.360> to

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
not like the fact that it's so hard to

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.870 
not like the fact that it's so hard to
take<00:03:16.900> it<00:03:17.020> off<00:03:17.140> just<00:03:17.650> sometimes<00:03:17.890> not<00:03:18.310> always<00:03:18.490> I

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
take it off just sometimes not always I

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.680 
take it off just sometimes not always I
don't<00:03:19.300> know<00:03:19.390> why<00:03:19.630> but<00:03:21.240> think<00:03:22.240> about<00:03:22.330> the<00:03:22.570> fact

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
don't know why but think about the fact

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.710 
don't know why but think about the fact
that<00:03:22.840> you<00:03:23.080> can<00:03:23.260> feel<00:03:23.740> very<00:03:24.220> protected<00:03:24.880> you

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
that you can feel very protected you

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.490 
that you can feel very protected you
want<00:03:25.990> you<00:03:26.680> will<00:03:26.890> never<00:03:27.190> have<00:03:27.460> to<00:03:27.490> worry<00:03:27.790> about

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
want you will never have to worry about

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.400 
want you will never have to worry about
losing<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.710> case<00:03:29.890> in<00:03:30.190> the<00:03:30.520> bad<00:03:31.300> moment<00:03:31.780> all

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
losing the case in the bad moment all

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.620 
losing the case in the bad moment all
right<00:03:32.820> one<00:03:33.820> other<00:03:33.990> sort<00:03:34.990> of<00:03:35.200> issue<00:03:35.880> not<00:03:36.880> so<00:03:37.270> big

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
right one other sort of issue not so big

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.440 
right one other sort of issue not so big
it's<00:03:38.110> that<00:03:38.350> the<00:03:38.560> duck<00:03:38.740> port<00:03:39.130> you<00:03:39.970> place<00:03:40.270> it

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
it's that the duck port you place it

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.949 
it's that the duck port you place it
here<00:03:41.400> it's<00:03:42.400> really<00:03:42.820> really<00:03:43.090> hard<00:03:43.300> to<00:03:43.510> take<00:03:43.720> off

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
here it's really really hard to take off

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.940 
here it's really really hard to take off
because<00:03:44.770> the<00:03:44.980> the<00:03:45.490> case<00:03:45.670> is<00:03:45.850> so<00:03:46.230> it<00:03:47.230> has<00:03:47.590> a<00:03:47.620> very

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
because the the case is so it has a very

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.180 
because the the case is so it has a very
tight<00:03:48.280> fit<00:03:48.970> to<00:03:49.180> it<00:03:49.330> so<00:03:49.800> even<00:03:50.800> if<00:03:50.890> you<00:03:51.010> have

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
tight fit to it so even if you have

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.960 
tight fit to it so even if you have
males<00:03:51.670> and<00:03:52.260> thin<00:03:53.260> fingers<00:03:53.709> it's<00:03:54.610> sometimes

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
males and thin fingers it's sometimes

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.240 
males and thin fingers it's sometimes
really<00:03:55.300> hard<00:03:55.420> to<00:03:55.990> take<00:03:56.200> it<00:03:56.380> off<00:03:56.730> but<00:03:57.730> again<00:03:59.250> you

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
really hard to take it off but again you

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.570 
really hard to take it off but again you
don't<00:04:00.610> generally<00:04:01.540> sing<00:04:02.200> the<00:04:02.380> Nano<00:04:02.590> every<00:04:03.190> two

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
don't generally sing the Nano every two

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.630 
don't generally sing the Nano every two
hours<00:04:03.630> so<00:04:04.630> just<00:04:05.260> take<00:04:05.530> your<00:04:05.709> time<00:04:05.770> work<00:04:06.310> it<00:04:06.520> out

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
hours so just take your time work it out

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.699 
hours so just take your time work it out
any<00:04:06.880> well<00:04:07.180> come<00:04:07.450> out<00:04:07.660> and<00:04:07.990> you<00:04:08.260> will<00:04:08.440> never

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
any well come out and you will never

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.910 
any well come out and you will never
damaged<00:04:09.340> it<00:04:09.550> because<00:04:10.540> it's<00:04:10.720> very<00:04:11.050> strong

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
damaged it because it's very strong

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.390 
damaged it because it's very strong
evening<00:04:12.700> it's<00:04:12.820> it's<00:04:13.780> made<00:04:14.650> out<00:04:14.800> of<00:04:14.830> a<00:04:15.690> sort<00:04:16.690> of

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
evening it's it's made out of a sort of
