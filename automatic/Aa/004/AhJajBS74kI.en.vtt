00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
model now based on design alone it's

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.070 
model now based on design alone it's
clear<00:00:20.310> that<00:00:20.340> Sony<00:00:20.760> had<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.119> ipod<00:00:21.300> nano<00:00:21.630> firmly

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
clear that Sony had the ipod nano firmly

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.140 
clear that Sony had the ipod nano firmly
in<00:00:22.350> its<00:00:22.470> sights<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:23.250> it's<00:00:23.369> not<00:00:23.490> stunning<00:00:23.880> as

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
in its sights and it's not stunning as

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.179 
in its sights and it's not stunning as
the<00:00:24.180> Nano<00:00:24.449> but<00:00:24.930> it's<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.260> very<00:00:25.590> very<00:00:25.680> good

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
the Nano but it's a very very good

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.040 
the Nano but it's a very very good
attempt<00:00:26.609> from<00:00:26.699> Sony<00:00:27.090> if<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.599> flung<00:00:27.869> in<00:00:27.990> a

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
attempt from Sony if you flung in a

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.599 
attempt from Sony if you flung in a
camera<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.500> would<00:00:28.619> look<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.949> feel<00:00:29.189> pretty

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
camera it would look and feel pretty

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.820

similar<00:00:30.300> now<00:00:31.019> it's<00:00:31.170> seven<00:00:31.439> point<00:00:31.679> two

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830
