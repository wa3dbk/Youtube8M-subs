00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
green oh it I did not notice this it is

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:48.850 
green oh it I did not notice this it is
reversed<00:04:46.990> they<00:04:47.990> actually<00:04:48.320> reversed<00:04:48.620> it<00:04:48.770> I'm

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
reversed they actually reversed it I'm

reversed they actually reversed it I'm
like<00:04:48.980> what's<00:04:49.280> the<00:04:49.340> point<00:04:49.430> man<00:04:49.790> the<00:04:49.940> only

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
like what's the point man the only

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.820 
like what's the point man the only
difference<00:04:50.450> is<00:04:50.540> the<00:04:50.690> green<00:04:50.960> itself<00:04:51.530> but

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
difference is the green itself but

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.470 
difference is the green itself but
actually<00:04:52.640> if<00:04:52.730> you<00:04:52.790> look<00:04:52.820> at<00:04:53.090> it<00:04:53.120> they<00:04:53.300> did

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
actually if you look at it they did

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.070 
actually if you look at it they did
reverse<00:04:53.810> the<00:04:54.020> colors<00:04:54.670> so<00:04:55.670> that<00:04:56.030> is<00:04:56.810> a<00:04:56.840> little

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
reverse the colors so that is a little

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.560 
reverse the colors so that is a little
different<00:04:57.440> is<00:04:58.280> it<00:04:58.370> that<00:04:58.970> is<00:04:59.120> a<00:04:59.180> hundred

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
different is it that is a hundred

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.840 
different is it that is a hundred
dollars<00:04:59.810> more<00:05:00.380> work<00:05:00.650> different<00:05:01.250> probably<00:05:01.700> not

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
dollars more work different probably not
