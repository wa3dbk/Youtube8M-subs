these two settings that are specific to

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.559 
these two settings that are specific to
your<00:02:38.410> HD<00:02:38.860> radio<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.819> first<00:02:40.090> one<00:02:40.299> up<00:02:40.420> is<00:02:40.510> the

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
your HD radio the first one up is the

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.000 
your HD radio the first one up is the
seek<00:02:40.930> setting<00:02:41.379> and<00:02:41.500> right<00:02:41.650> now<00:02:41.769> we<00:02:41.830> are

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
seek setting and right now we are

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.970 
seek setting and right now we are
seeking<00:02:42.459> all<00:02:42.640> radio<00:02:43.150> stations<00:02:43.450> both<00:02:44.140> HD<00:02:44.709> and

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
seeking all radio stations both HD and

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.460 
seeking all radio stations both HD and
analog<00:02:45.700> stations<00:02:46.239> we<00:02:46.660> can<00:02:46.840> touch<00:02:47.049> that<00:02:47.260> and

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
analog stations we can touch that and

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.370 
analog stations we can touch that and
seek<00:02:47.680> only<00:02:48.160> HD<00:02:48.400> radio<00:02:49.030> stations<00:02:49.510> or<00:02:49.840> switch<00:02:50.349> it

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
seek only HD radio stations or switch it

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.680 
seek only HD radio stations or switch it
back<00:02:50.650> to<00:02:50.860> Swit<00:02:51.069> to<00:02:51.370> seek<00:02:51.549> all<00:02:51.760> all<00:02:52.180> types<00:02:52.510> of

to<00:02:57.040> analog<00:02:57.400> auto<00:02:57.700> blending<00:02:58.299> you<00:02:58.750> can<00:02:58.959> switch

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
to analog auto blending you can switch

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.470 
to analog auto blending you can switch
that<00:02:59.470> to<00:02:59.650> only<00:03:00.010> analog<00:03:00.489> you'll<00:03:00.910> find<00:03:01.239> this<00:03:01.420> a

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
that to only analog you'll find this a

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.900 
that to only analog you'll find this a
useful<00:03:02.049> tool<00:03:02.290> if<00:03:02.560> you're<00:03:02.980> in<00:03:03.129> an<00:03:03.250> area<00:03:03.459> where

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
useful tool if you're in an area where

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.300 
useful tool if you're in an area where
the<00:03:04.180> HD<00:03:04.569> radio<00:03:04.930> stations<00:03:05.379> tend<00:03:05.650> to<00:03:05.829> be<00:03:05.980> weak

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
the HD radio stations tend to be weak

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.670 
the HD radio stations tend to be weak
you<00:03:06.849> can<00:03:07.030> switch<00:03:07.299> this<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:07.660> only<00:03:07.840> analog<00:03:08.440> and

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
you can switch this to only analog and

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.860 
you can switch this to only analog and
that<00:03:09.099> will<00:03:09.250> lock<00:03:09.400> in<00:03:09.610> the<00:03:09.730> analog<00:03:10.180> signals<00:03:10.690> for

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
that will lock in the analog signals for

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.720 
that will lock in the analog signals for
you<00:03:10.959> where<00:03:11.440> the<00:03:11.560> HD<00:03:11.890> radio<00:03:12.160> stations<00:03:12.579> are

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
you where the HD radio stations are

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.229 
you where the HD radio stations are
strong<00:03:13.000> you<00:03:13.329> can<00:03:13.660> probably<00:03:13.870> use<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.410> DA<00:03:14.680> auto

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
strong you can probably use the DA auto

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.130 
strong you can probably use the DA auto
system<00:03:16.239> right<00:03:16.390> here<00:03:16.599> and<00:03:16.780> it<00:03:16.870> will<00:03:16.989> switch

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
system right here and it will switch

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.620 
system right here and it will switch
between<00:03:17.500> analog<00:03:18.220> and<00:03:18.519> HD<00:03:18.940> radio<00:03:18.970> stations

between analog and HD radio stations

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.650 
between analog and HD radio stations
without<00:03:19.900> you<00:03:20.049> even<00:03:20.200> knowing<00:03:20.500> it
