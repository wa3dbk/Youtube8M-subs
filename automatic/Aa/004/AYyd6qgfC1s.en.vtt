00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
they bounce a little bit and then it

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.910 
they bounce a little bit and then it
uses<00:01:50.520> your<00:01:50.729> sensor<00:01:51.600> your<00:01:51.869> accelerometer<00:01:52.770> or

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
uses your sensor your accelerometer or

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.280 
uses your sensor your accelerometer or
g-sensor<00:01:53.960> to<00:01:56.030> make<00:01:57.030> them<00:01:57.240> fall<00:01:57.509> it's<00:01:57.869> really

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
g-sensor to make them fall it's really

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.340 
g-sensor to make them fall it's really
stupid<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:59.090> if<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.299> was<00:02:00.420> paid<00:02:00.659> no<00:02:01.049> one<00:02:01.200> would

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
stupid and if it was paid no one would

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.410 
stupid and if it was paid no one would
get<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.649> but<00:02:02.430> it's<00:02:02.549> really<00:02:02.700> fun<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.030> just<00:02:03.240> mess

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
bounce a little bit it's one of the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.060 
bounce a little bit it's one of the
stupidest<00:02:27.330> ones<00:02:27.510> I've<00:02:27.600> ever<00:02:27.660> seen<00:02:27.990> but<00:02:28.950> it's

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
stupidest ones I've ever seen but it's

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.740 
stupidest ones I've ever seen but it's
really<00:02:29.340> fun<00:02:29.550> just<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:29.850> fool<00:02:30.060> around<00:02:30.120> on<00:02:30.540> which

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
really fun just to fool around on which

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.470 
really fun just to fool around on which
is<00:02:30.870> why<00:02:30.990> they<00:02:31.140> included<00:02:31.560> it<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:31.880> I<00:02:32.880> really<00:02:33.360> do

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
is why they included it and I really do

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.120 
is why they included it and I really do
think<00:02:33.660> this<00:02:33.840> is<00:02:34.020> one<00:02:34.350> of<00:02:34.380> my<00:02:34.560> favorites<00:02:34.980> that

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
think this is one of my favorites that

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.460 
think this is one of my favorites that
I've<00:02:35.280> seen<00:02:35.520> just<00:02:35.820> because<00:02:36.120> it's<00:02:36.300> it's<00:02:37.290> very

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
I've seen just because it's it's very

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.600 
I've seen just because it's it's very
mental<00:02:37.740> minimalistic<00:02:38.580> but<00:02:39.390> it's<00:02:39.510> really<00:02:39.660> fun

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
mental minimalistic but it's really fun

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.950 
mental minimalistic but it's really fun
detail<00:02:41.610> wise<00:02:41.850> and<00:02:42.120> graphics<00:02:42.450> wise<00:02:42.600> it's<00:02:42.840> not

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
detail wise and graphics wise it's not

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.320 
detail wise and graphics wise it's not
that<00:02:43.140> great<00:02:43.170> but<00:02:43.560> fun<00:02:44.250> wise<00:02:44.460> it's<00:02:44.790> definitely

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
that great but fun wise it's definitely

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.780 
that great but fun wise it's definitely
at<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.600> top<00:02:45.900> so<00:02:46.890> I<00:02:46.920> have<00:02:47.220> one<00:02:47.460> more<00:02:47.490> to<00:02:47.730> show

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
wallpaper I was kind of disappointing

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.300 
wallpaper I was kind of disappointing
with<00:02:54.810> this<00:02:54.960> is<00:02:55.200> it's<00:02:55.350> not<00:02:55.500> advertised<00:02:56.040> as

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
with this is it's not advertised as

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.430 
with this is it's not advertised as
being<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:57.360> free<00:02:57.570> version<00:02:57.750> but<00:02:58.110> if<00:02:58.230> you<00:02:58.290> try<00:02:58.410> to

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
being the free version but if you try to

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.390 
being the free version but if you try to
hop<00:02:58.620> into<00:02:58.800> settings<00:02:59.270> a<00:03:00.270> lot<00:03:00.840> of<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:01.400> cool

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
hop into settings a lot of the cool

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.270 
hop into settings a lot of the cool
effects<00:03:03.380> touch-sensitive<00:03:04.380> mode<00:03:04.830> which<00:03:05.130> is

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
effects touch-sensitive mode which is

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.860 
effects touch-sensitive mode which is
probably<00:03:05.490> the<00:03:05.640> coolest<00:03:06.180> one<00:03:06.600> where<00:03:06.780> you<00:03:06.840> can

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
probably the coolest one where you can

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.500 
probably the coolest one where you can
make<00:03:07.050> your<00:03:07.170> own<00:03:07.260> fireworks<00:03:07.680> launch<00:03:08.010> is<00:03:08.510> only

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
make your own fireworks launch is only

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.510 
make your own fireworks launch is only
in<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:09.810> paid<00:03:09.990> version<00:03:10.020> I<00:03:10.590> find<00:03:11.250> that<00:03:11.340> really

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
in the paid version I find that really

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.340 
in the paid version I find that really
disappointing<00:03:12.150> because<00:03:12.240> it's<00:03:12.420> not<00:03:12.540> stated<00:03:13.230> as

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
disappointing because it's not stated as

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.120 
disappointing because it's not stated as
that<00:03:13.680> but<00:03:14.780> it<00:03:15.780> is<00:03:15.900> what<00:03:16.080> it<00:03:16.170> is<00:03:16.290> all<00:03:16.770> the<00:03:17.040> other

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
that but it is what it is all the other

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.590 
that but it is what it is all the other
settings<00:03:17.489> are<00:03:17.640> accessible<00:03:18.150> by<00:03:18.270> you<00:03:18.330> but

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
settings are accessible by you but

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.620 
settings are accessible by you but
really<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.500> coolest<00:03:19.830> one<00:03:20.040> is<00:03:20.420> definitely<00:03:21.420> the

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
really the coolest one is definitely the

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.440 
really the coolest one is definitely the
touch-sensitive<00:03:22.410> mode<00:03:23.130> but<00:03:23.940> I'm<00:03:24.180> gonna<00:03:24.300> set

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
touch-sensitive mode but I'm gonna set

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.540 
touch-sensitive mode but I'm gonna set
the<00:03:24.540> wallpaper<00:03:24.690> just<00:03:25.170> so<00:03:25.230> you<00:03:25.320> can<00:03:25.410> see<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:26.160> it

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
the wallpaper just so you can see and it

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:27.830 
the wallpaper just so you can see and it
definitely<00:03:26.730> looks<00:03:27.090> really<00:03:27.300> nice<00:03:27.450> as<00:03:27.690> you<00:03:27.750> can

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
definitely looks really nice as you can

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.090 
definitely looks really nice as you can
see<00:03:27.959> the<00:03:28.080> clouds<00:03:28.290> kind<00:03:28.530> of<00:03:28.590> spin<00:03:28.770> around<00:03:28.860> a

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
see the clouds kind of spin around a

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.820 
see the clouds kind of spin around a
little<00:03:29.220> bit<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:30.080> they<00:03:31.080> just<00:03:31.110> shoot<00:03:31.560> fireworks

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
little bit and they just shoot fireworks

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.660 
little bit and they just shoot fireworks
