00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:02.540
 what is a natural inclination 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:08.029
 what is a talent this talent must with chart quotation 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:12.849
 kia the idv duty 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:16.560
 games foster integration of children egypt offers 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.840
 we have visions 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.939
 sometimes it kept us in check 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.270
 positive positive street 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.710
 referring to philosophers of education as john would say 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:32.359
 uahahah those 

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:35.450
 aldo visalberghi e 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:36.880
 Codignola 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.630
 I am a cowling 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:39.720
 that 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.990
 an epochal change in the Italian school was the one founded by 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.490
 kind 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.650
 and strongly opposed 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.670
 to the idea that in the matrix culture 100 euros per 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.640
 there was 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.640
 too much space for science 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.530
 for the class 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.440
 that entered the first grade finished the five years of elementary school in 1962 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.440
 so exactly my generation 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.140
 the middle school of berta unica 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.610
 becomes mandatory for all children 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.080
 and there is no longer the start for thigh work 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.149
 that 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.980
 he was leaving his studies 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.700
 there social classes kerry group 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.860
 social 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.990
 and the subject of scientific observation is born a small revolution that 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.120
 completely changes the panorama of Italian education 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.990
 then the opening will follow 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.540
 at the University 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.580
 such as 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:56.510
 role of our research groups we have been very concerned with orienting 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.050
 starting from these slides it is up to each one 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.550
 talented anyone Olympic at one 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:05.380
 aura 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:12.170
 inclination therefore starting from 1993 with the courageous law of antonio 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.529
 ruberti the spread of scientific and technological culture 

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:21.839
 a legislative initiative is born for which all scientific institutions 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:23.819
 and book 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.790
 in contact also mosi 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.220
 in such a way as to be done 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.549
 that any young talent comes into contact with science technicians 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.549
 since 1996 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:44.449
 last evening list begins for example how to choose 1 yes drawing al 

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:49.189
 nuclear as so many universities start to open up to schools we have adopted 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:53.649
 that year the closest to the brothers flag of Rome where not by chance 

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:59.329
 the famous alberto taught the master who is thanks to the division 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:01.829
 of the highly successful transmission 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.749
 it's never too late 

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:09.309
 will attempt a mass literacy of an Italy of the years 

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:14.419
 of which the other illiteracy was a mass phenomenon our slogan and not 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:19.629
 It is never too early to bring the child into laboratories what contact 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:25.839
 with science, another initiative that lasted a few years and that year 

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:28.270
 among them I will choose gymnasium 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.019
 picasa high school classic terenzio mamani of rome 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.150
 in particular the classics su ono 

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:38.549
 the experimental pitcher address 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.349
 is our boys' institute of 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:45.750
 read in the last last year of high school they run a little experiment 

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:49.639
 they also seek to communicate it to a scientific conference 

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:52.149
 in these classes 

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:56.539
 we noticed an increase in enrollment in schools 

00:03:57.259 --> 00:04:00.569
 ah university science subjects 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.699
 in the shelter red dress also has been tied 

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:06.529
 at the University of Bologna 

00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:10.409
 because at the national level for the centenary celebration 

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:12.439
 d 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:14.699
 ulisse aldrovandi 

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:18.769
 a few centuries participated in the history of culture 

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:25.579
 European because it has rolandi removed professor of logic of pharmacology 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.979
 Some initiatives are linked to the programs of the schools 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.280
 of the universities 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.440
 related to natural sciences and the way in which edits are intended 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.890
 today 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.630
 the tools are diversified 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.590
 the genoa science festival is a non-regional national event 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.529
 the turnout is massive 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:51.579
 there is a Perucca science festival these are all 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.460
 creations of interaction and the discovery of talent 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.830
 all targeted has an urbanized idv route 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.319
 whose final 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:03.199
 to that 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:06.199
 blond university faculty 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:12.900
 museums and botanical gardens are fundamental places in the history of the 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.120
 my generation dates from the beginning of the 50s 

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:19.389
 as places of aggregation check 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:23.819
 this is still valid in some big cities and is important 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:26.110
 cysts of tv6 courts 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.330
 they are historically leclerc you 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.680
 where the motivations towards scientific dressing up 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.819
 somehow 

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:36.170
 is consolidated 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:41.900
 it is the new sometimes dusty sometimes seemingly boring where the is made 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:42.879
 silly 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:44.889
 and it is important to say that today 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:46.930
 at the festival how to show 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.089
 they are more often the grandparents and sometimes dizzi 

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:51.539
 that carry it 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:52.610
 boys 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.210
 because the parents 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.319
 too busy with the work expended do not go 

00:05:57.319 --> 00:05:59.729
 possibility therefore for us 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:03.650
 we are trying to spread the scientific and technological culture 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:04.569
 noticed 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:09.889
 that closer to the university choice for girls there is some 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:14.479
 time the group of grandparents next to that of the parents a few hits the 

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:15.379
 time 

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:19.039
 to be able to get the boy to discover t tokyo
