rolls<00:01:32.990> and<00:01:34.270> after<00:01:35.270> i<00:01:35.299> did<00:01:35.659> i<00:01:36.280> had<00:01:37.280> my<00:01:37.520> hay<00:01:37.790> field

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
rolls and after i did i had my hay field

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.610 
rolls and after i did i had my hay field
cut<00:01:38.390> and<00:01:39.229> on<00:01:39.650> about<00:01:39.860> the<00:01:40.159> third<00:01:40.400> day<00:01:40.729> I<00:01:41.500> think<00:01:42.500> I

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
cut and on about the third day I think I

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.000 
cut and on about the third day I think I
was<00:01:42.799> ready<00:01:43.040> to<00:01:43.520> Bale<00:01:43.760> hey<00:01:44.409> so<00:01:45.409> I<00:01:45.440> called<00:01:45.710> well

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
was ready to Bale hey so I called well

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.039 
was ready to Bale hey so I called well
my<00:01:46.369> friend<00:01:46.670> because<00:01:46.970> I<00:01:47.240> think<00:01:47.690> that's<00:01:47.960> a

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
my friend because I think that's a

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:49.420 
my friend because I think that's a
little<00:01:48.260> fast<00:01:48.409> for<00:01:48.590> drying<00:01:48.860> hey<00:01:49.070> because

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
little fast for drying hey because

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.350 
little fast for drying hey because
normally<00:01:50.240> with<00:01:50.570> my<00:01:50.750> old<00:01:51.490> 4890<00:01:52.490> conditioner

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
normally with my old 4890 conditioner

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.260 
normally with my old 4890 conditioner
rollers<00:01:53.690> I'd<00:01:53.869> be<00:01:54.490> six<00:01:55.490> seven<00:01:55.880> eight<00:01:56.000> days

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
rollers I'd be six seven eight days

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.170 
rollers I'd be six seven eight days
putting<00:01:56.780> up<00:01:56.930> the<00:01:57.049> same<00:01:57.229> hey<00:01:57.700> after<00:01:58.700> me<00:01:59.060> and

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
putting up the same hey after me and

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.570 
putting up the same hey after me and
rich<00:01:59.330> had<00:01:59.540> that<00:01:59.720> discussion<00:01:59.900> I<00:02:00.470> thought<00:02:01.369> well

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
rich had that discussion I thought well

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.260 
rich had that discussion I thought well
I<00:02:01.610> try<00:02:01.970> them<00:02:02.060> on<00:02:02.210> this<00:02:02.560> and<00:02:03.560> by<00:02:03.950> golly<00:02:04.220> then<00:02:05.119> it

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
I try them on this and by golly then it

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.270 
I try them on this and by golly then it
would<00:02:05.420> actually<00:02:05.600> dry<00:02:06.049> hay<00:02:06.290> before<00:02:06.650> it's<00:02:07.070> just

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
would actually dry hay before it's just

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.170 
would actually dry hay before it's just
same<00:02:07.880> thing<00:02:08.149> take<00:02:08.450> me<00:02:08.629> six<00:02:09.140> seven<00:02:09.560> days

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 
same thing take me six seven days

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.580 
same thing take me six seven days
obviously<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.330> trick<00:02:11.569> is<00:02:11.750> smashing<00:02:12.500> the

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
obviously the trick is smashing the

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.770 
obviously the trick is smashing the
entire<00:02:12.890> stem<00:02:13.310> well<00:02:13.610> before<00:02:14.030> them<00:02:14.270> John<00:02:14.540> Deere

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
entire stem well before them John Deere

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.340 
entire stem well before them John Deere
rolls<00:02:15.050> you

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
rolls you

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.320 
rolls you
wouldn't<00:02:15.530> have<00:02:15.650> a<00:02:15.680> kink<00:02:16.040> till<00:02:16.250> every<00:02:16.550> four<00:02:17.300> or

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
wouldn't have a kink till every four or
