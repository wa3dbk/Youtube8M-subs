00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
so basically you can see here that I've

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.769 
so basically you can see here that I've
constructed<00:00:21.599> my<00:00:22.230> folder<00:00:22.890> okay

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
constructed my folder okay

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.580 
constructed my folder okay
using<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:25.579> rubber<00:00:26.579> hose<00:00:27.169> basically<00:00:28.169> this<00:00:28.349> one

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
using a rubber hose basically this one

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.749 
using a rubber hose basically this one
is<00:00:28.800> form<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:30.320> this<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.590> radiator<00:00:32.070> hose<00:00:32.430> that

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
is form a this is a radiator hose that

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.290 
is form a this is a radiator hose that
is<00:00:32.910> commonly<00:00:33.300> used<00:00:33.360> for<00:00:33.629> crafts<00:00:34.199> and<00:00:35.089> I<00:00:36.089> have

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
is commonly used for crafts and I have

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.530 
is commonly used for crafts and I have
here<00:00:36.570> some<00:00:36.650> aluminum<00:00:37.650> piping<00:00:38.330> and<00:00:39.330> then

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
here some aluminum piping and then

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.060 
here some aluminum piping and then
another<00:00:41.210> already<00:00:42.210> part<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.379> radiator<00:00:43.710> hose

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
another already part of a radiator hose

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.810 
another already part of a radiator hose
that<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.550> made<00:00:44.790> as<00:00:45.089> a<00:00:45.540> collection<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.170> electrons

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
that I made as a collection of electrons

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.200 
that I made as a collection of electrons
between<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.120> throttle<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.809> entire<00:00:50.210> hose

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
between the throttle and the entire hose

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
point two point five inches inside the

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:05.779 
point two point five inches inside the
area<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.969> at<00:01:00.600> range<00:01:00.899> outside<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:02.100> end<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:04.789> it

00:01:05.779 --> 00:01:05.789 
area and at range outside the end and it

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:09.680 
area and at range outside the end and it
actually<00:01:06.030> goes<00:01:06.619> down<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.970> front<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.600> the

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
actually goes down in the front of the

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.270 
actually goes down in the front of the
bumper<00:01:09.869> which<00:01:10.860> where<00:01:11.550> I<00:01:11.580> had<00:01:11.970> my

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
bumper which where I had my

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.080 
bumper which where I had my
my<00:01:13.610> hair<00:01:13.790> filter<00:01:14.240> which<00:01:14.810> is<00:01:14.930> AC<00:01:15.110> motor<00:01:15.530> filter

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
my hair filter which is AC motor filter

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.470 
my hair filter which is AC motor filter
it<00:01:17.090> is<00:01:17.270> a<00:01:17.510> three<00:01:17.870> inch<00:01:18.050> smaller<00:01:18.860> filter

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:19.480 
it is a three inch smaller filter

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.800 
it is a three inch smaller filter
basically<00:01:20.480> the<00:01:21.170> toughest

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
basically the toughest

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.520 
basically the toughest
think<00:01:23.470> about<00:01:23.979> the<00:01:24.100> design<00:01:24.430> is<00:01:24.760> actually<00:01:25.530> this

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
think about the design is actually this

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.550 
think about the design is actually this
part<00:01:26.920> the<00:01:27.430> aluminum<00:01:27.909> piping<00:01:28.150> were<00:01:28.630> where<00:01:29.530> I

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
part the aluminum piping were where I

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.980 
part the aluminum piping were where I
placed<00:01:30.010> my<00:01:30.840> mass<00:01:31.840> airflow<00:01:32.200> sensor<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:33.990> the

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
placed my mass airflow sensor and the

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.690 
placed my mass airflow sensor and the
backing<00:01:35.229> of

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.910 

we<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.880> toughest<00:01:39.270> thing<00:01:39.450> here<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.920> actually

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
we the toughest thing here is actually

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.520 
we the toughest thing here is actually
creating<00:01:41.429> a<00:01:41.549> plan<00:01:41.850> for<00:01:42.750> your<00:01:42.960> mass<00:01:43.229> airflow

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
creating a plan for your mass airflow

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.559 
creating a plan for your mass airflow
sensor<00:01:44.210> which<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.359> this<00:01:45.539> this<00:01:45.929> one<00:01:46.170> I

00:01:47.559 --> 00:01:47.569 
sensor which is this this one I

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:51.570 
sensor which is this this one I
constructed<00:01:48.569> this<00:01:48.810> one<00:01:49.079> using<00:01:49.619> an<00:01:49.859> epoxy<00:01:50.429> clay

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
constructed this one using an epoxy clay

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.810 
constructed this one using an epoxy clay
so<00:01:52.090> basically<00:01:52.570> it's<00:01:52.870> a<00:01:53.080> move<00:01:53.740> like<00:01:54.100> way<00:01:54.340> but<00:01:54.670> it

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
so basically it's a move like way but it

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.130 
so basically it's a move like way but it
hardens<00:01:55.330> like<00:01:55.450> steel<00:01:55.990> and<00:01:56.730> I<00:01:57.750> place<00:01:58.750> here

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
hardens like steel and I place here

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.480 
hardens like steel and I place here
something

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
something

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.800 
something
