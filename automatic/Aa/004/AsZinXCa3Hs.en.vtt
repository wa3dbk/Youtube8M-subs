and<00:02:14.180> then<00:02:14.390> just<00:02:14.540> flip<00:02:14.780> them<00:02:14.930> right<00:02:15.140> over<00:02:15.440> and

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
and then just flip them right over and

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.440 
and then just flip them right over and
at<00:02:15.770> the<00:02:15.890> top<00:02:16.070> because<00:02:16.520> the<00:02:16.640> back<00:02:16.790> is<00:02:17.060> gonna<00:02:17.240> be

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
at the top because the back is gonna be

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.630 
at the top because the back is gonna be
up<00:02:17.600> against<00:02:18.020> the<00:02:18.170> wall<00:02:18.350> for<00:02:19.100> some<00:02:19.280> reason<00:02:19.520> this

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
up against the wall for some reason this

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.440 
up against the wall for some reason this
isn't<00:02:19.820> coming<00:02:20.180> out<00:02:20.270> right<00:02:20.480> but<00:02:20.630> you<00:02:20.780> can<00:02:20.930> see

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
isn't coming out right but you can see

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.760 
isn't coming out right but you can see
nothing<00:02:23.450> fancy<00:02:23.870> about<00:02:23.960> that<00:02:24.110> except<00:02:24.650> this

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
nothing fancy about that except this

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.590 
nothing fancy about that except this
will<00:02:24.950> absorb<00:02:25.400> so<00:02:25.790> if<00:02:25.880> you<00:02:26.000> don't<00:02:26.180> have<00:02:26.420> one

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
will absorb so if you don't have one

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.370 
will absorb so if you don't have one
that's<00:02:26.780> a<00:02:26.870> primer<00:02:27.200> it's<00:02:27.860> gonna<00:02:28.250> still<00:02:28.610> absorb

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
that's a primer it's gonna still absorb

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.860 
that's a primer it's gonna still absorb
then<00:02:30.380> I<00:02:30.709> decided<00:02:31.190> I<00:02:31.520> wanted<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:32.060> base<00:02:32.270> to<00:02:32.720> be<00:02:32.840> a

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
then I decided I wanted the base to be a

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.590 
then I decided I wanted the base to be a
different<00:02:33.290> color<00:02:33.500> in<00:02:34.250> this<00:02:34.550> case<00:02:34.850> I<00:02:35.090> made<00:02:35.330> it<00:02:35.390> a

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
different color in this case I made it a

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.530 
different color in this case I made it a
chalkboard<00:02:35.980> all<00:02:36.980> I<00:02:37.040> did<00:02:37.430> to<00:02:37.610> do<00:02:37.760> that<00:02:38.000> was<00:02:38.300> I

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
chalkboard all I did to do that was I

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.620 
chalkboard all I did to do that was I
used<00:02:38.780> some<00:02:39.230> fat<00:02:39.530> blue<00:02:39.860> tape<00:02:40.130> and<00:02:40.730> taped<00:02:41.480> it

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
used some fat blue tape and taped it

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.690 
used some fat blue tape and taped it
right<00:02:41.930> where<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.470> antler<00:02:42.890> meets<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.489> base

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
right where the antler meets the base

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.690 
right where the antler meets the base
and<00:02:44.090> then<00:02:44.840> I<00:02:44.959> covered<00:02:45.440> it<00:02:45.590> I<00:02:45.830> just<00:02:46.670> put<00:02:47.090> a<00:02:48.700> trash

ways<00:05:07.100> to<00:05:07.400> do<00:05:07.520> that<00:05:07.669> one<00:05:08.450> you<00:05:08.690> can<00:05:08.870> take<00:05:09.050> a

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
ways to do that one you can take a

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.060 
ways to do that one you can take a
thinner<00:05:10.000> tape<00:05:11.000> and<00:05:11.510> at<00:05:12.410> Michaels

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
thinner tape and at Michaels

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.980 
thinner tape and at Michaels
they<00:05:13.310> have<00:05:13.580> northa<00:05:14.030> Stewart<00:05:14.419> tape<00:05:14.720> that's

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
they have northa Stewart tape that's

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.990 
they have northa Stewart tape that's
even<00:05:15.500> smaller<00:05:15.710> than<00:05:16.039> this<00:05:16.310> you<00:05:16.520> could<00:05:16.669> go<00:05:16.880> with

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
even smaller than this you could go with

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.730 
even smaller than this you could go with
teeny<00:05:17.300> tiny<00:05:17.690> stripes<00:05:18.110> which<00:05:18.350> I<00:05:18.500> think

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
teeny tiny stripes which I think

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.730 
teeny tiny stripes which I think
actually<00:05:18.890> might<00:05:19.220> benefit<00:05:20.289> take<00:05:21.289> your<00:05:21.500> tape

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
actually might benefit take your tape

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.270 
actually might benefit take your tape
off<00:05:21.979> that<00:05:22.250> you<00:05:22.370> use<00:05:22.640> to<00:05:22.940> protect<00:05:23.419> the<00:05:23.630> antler

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
off that you use to protect the antler

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.960 
off that you use to protect the antler
and<00:05:25.280> in<00:05:26.270> this<00:05:26.419> case<00:05:26.720> because<00:05:27.560> I<00:05:27.590> spent<00:05:28.070> so<00:05:28.550> much

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
and in this case because I spent so much

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.690 
and in this case because I spent so much
time<00:05:29.030> with<00:05:29.600> that<00:05:29.780> tape<00:05:30.080> and<00:05:30.770> you<00:05:31.130> have<00:05:31.340> to<00:05:31.520> get

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:31.700 
time with that tape and you have to get

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.740 
time with that tape and you have to get
these<00:05:31.880> kind<00:05:32.270> of<00:05:32.419> even<00:05:33.010> I'm<00:05:34.010> gonna<00:05:34.430> suggest

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
these kind of even I'm gonna suggest

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.230 
these kind of even I'm gonna suggest
that<00:05:35.750> you<00:05:35.900> just<00:05:36.169> freehand<00:05:37.010> it<00:05:37.190> so<00:05:38.000> in<00:05:38.090> this

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
that you just freehand it so in this

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.779 
that you just freehand it so in this
case<00:05:38.539> since<00:05:39.440> we<00:05:39.500> already<00:05:39.740> have<00:05:40.039> a<00:05:40.070> black<00:05:40.430> base

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:40.789 
case since we already have a black base

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:43.990 
case since we already have a black base
I<00:05:41.320> think<00:05:42.320> I'm<00:05:42.440> going<00:05:42.620> to<00:05:42.710> use<00:05:42.979> a<00:05:43.250> bright<00:05:43.520> teal

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
I think I'm going to use a bright teal

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.980 
I think I'm going to use a bright teal
and<00:05:44.950> do<00:05:45.950> stripes<00:05:46.340> don't<00:05:46.820> you<00:05:46.940> probably<00:05:47.720> don't

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
and do stripes don't you probably don't

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.020 
and do stripes don't you probably don't
do<00:05:48.110> polka<00:05:48.350> dots<00:05:48.650> I<00:05:48.950> guess<00:05:49.250> if<00:05:49.400> you<00:05:49.490> love<00:05:49.700> polka

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.030 
do polka dots I guess if you love polka

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.050 
do polka dots I guess if you love polka
dots<00:05:50.210> what<00:05:50.419> the<00:05:50.510> heck<00:05:50.690> but<00:05:51.340> plaids<00:05:52.340> would<00:05:52.910> be

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
dots what the heck but plaids would be

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.400 
dots what the heck but plaids would be
cool<00:05:53.350> Chevron's<00:05:54.350> are<00:05:54.680> cool<00:05:56.110> stripes<00:05:57.110> are

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
cool Chevron's are cool stripes are

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.800 
cool Chevron's are cool stripes are
great<00:05:57.650> I'm<00:05:58.250> thinking<00:05:59.090> about<00:05:59.210> these<00:05:59.510> for<00:05:59.780> a

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
great I'm thinking about these for a

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.659 
great I'm thinking about these for a
boy's<00:06:00.050> room<00:06:00.169> and<00:06:00.940> so<00:06:01.940> if<00:06:02.120> I<00:06:02.270> do<00:06:02.330> polka<00:06:02.690> dots

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 
boy's room and so if I do polka dots

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:05.830 
boy's room and so if I do polka dots
then<00:06:04.669> we're<00:06:04.820> gonna<00:06:04.910> start<00:06:05.300> looking<00:06:05.660> a<00:06:05.750> little

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
then we're gonna start looking a little

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.790 
then we're gonna start looking a little
girly<00:06:07.030> and<00:06:08.030> we<00:06:08.120> might<00:06:08.330> even<00:06:08.570> want<00:06:09.350> to<00:06:09.410> be<00:06:09.530> sure

and maybe even use a darker teal but

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.370 
and maybe even use a darker teal but
