00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.530
 the bet your servant heart understood 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:11.719
 to judge your people and to discern 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.880
 between the good and the bad because who 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.070
 can govern be your people so big 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.410
 and it pleased God that Solomon asked for this 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.169
 almost nobody asks for that bye today 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.790
 what is spiritual discernment is 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:24.980
 the ability to distinguish between 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.809
 truth and the lie between good and 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.790
 evil between sound doctrine and false 

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:31.520
 doctrine comes from the Greek that means 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.860
 scrutinize examine interrogate is 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.690
 synonymous with thinking biblically today the 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.059
 problem in many churches is the lack 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.800
 of discernment Christians do not 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.839
 they ask not discern what they eat 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.820
 give them and also the pastors do not teach 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:47.149
 to the believers to discern to scrutinize 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.589
 to ask to inquire to examine 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.719
 many do not want to teach it because 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:52.699
 they run the risk of being discovered in 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.859
 your lies prefer to have people 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.140
 ignorance is ignorance 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:59.149
 mother manipulating a person 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.550
 ignorant does not discern is manipulated 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.109
 it is not convenient for them to teach 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.879
 word of God because people are 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:06.800
 teaches to discern between the good and the 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.930
 bad between the just and the unfair between 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.060
 clean and dirty but lack of 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.250
 discernment prevents us from taking root 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.079
 the truths of the bible what it gives us 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.600
 discernment is the knowledge of 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:19.220
 word of God the shepherds forget 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.039
 of what God in the words of Ezekiel 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.950
 he said to the priests see ezequiel 44 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:26.899
 23 says they will teach my people to do 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.520
 difference between the holy and the profane and 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.890
 will teach them to discern between what 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.170
 clean and what does not clean this is a mandate 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.479
 forgotten today look at the evil of the people of 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.250
 Israel in the time of Isaiah there are of the 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.470
 that to the bad they say good and to the good 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.899
 bad that they make light darkness and 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.479
 the light darkness that put the bitter 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:47.600
 for sweet and sweet for bitter is to say 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.159
 they have no discernment that evil of the 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.470
 Israelites is today's in many 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.170
 churches there is no discernment that 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.880
 it helps to check God's will 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.250
 let's see it in Romans 12 2 no os 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.289
 conform to this century be satisfied 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.240
 means to adapt take a form a 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:03.860
 North God says do not conform to the style 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.689
 of life of people who do not know God 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.670
 in the absence of discernment between 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.860
 God's people that's what happens 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.019
 tell me if not the church today looks like 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.610
 more to the world it seems that the world is the 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.459
 light of the church because it is copied 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.600
 everything says yes not transformed by means 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.359
 of the renewal of your 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.920
 understanding so you check for 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:24.040
 that you examine and check the good 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.569
 will of god nice and perfect 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.019
 because God says we have to renew 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.850
 our thoughts isaiah 55 8 says 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.519
 because my thoughts are not yours 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.890
 thoughts or your ways are my 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.470
 ways like the heavens are higher 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.120
 that the earth like this are my ways God 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.250
 it will never be reduced to our level 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.560
 everything that does not go according to your 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.450
 word must be discarded his ways 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.519
 are about any good idea of â€‹â€‹any 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.230
 man but the bad thing is that if today you 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.060
 he goes to the preacher and tells him that he has said 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.930
 something contrary to the bible they say 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:59.000
 close your mouth or be forbidden to discern 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.739
 let's go back to 1st of kings 39 here we see that 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.350
 Solomon asks for an understanding heart 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.720
 judge to govern says give me heart 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.359
 understood I want to be able to understand 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.980
 distinguish between good and bad and is 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:11.750
 that discernment is needed to 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.120
 guide a town no matter what 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.220
 size be the pastor must be able to 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.010
 understand the bible and then explain it to 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.780
 people sometimes preachers quote 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.500
 human thoughts as if they were 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.870
 biblical 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.700
 people do not discern and if there are any 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.250
 that discerns who studies and says that does not 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.620
 says the bible shut up the problem is 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.260
 serious but this happens in the first to the 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.000
 Thessalonians 521 Paul teaches that 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.010
 discern is the responsibility of everything 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.440
 Christian because he is involved 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.630
 spiritual health says no disparagements 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.310
 the prophecies does not refer anything else to 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.680
 what we understand as prophecy but to 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.390
 the preaching of the word of God what 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.030
 what Paul says is when they hear the 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.560
 message examine all all parties 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.959
 of what is taught of what is said 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.860
 here to examine means to put to the test 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.050
 distinguish 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.300
 check examine everything and retain 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.130
 only the good what the bible says 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.840
 in its true meaning and not the 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.780
 personal interpretation of each 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.700
 as it suits you on 1st of juan 41 god 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.070
 He commands us not to believe every spirit but 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.620
 to test the spirits is the same as 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.360
 says Paul in Thessalonians then in 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.800
 the bible the discernment is not something 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.959
 optional for the Christian but 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.850
 necessary is the key to a life 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.250
 solid Christian which depends on the 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.080
 discernment that we have Paul 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.910
 ran into a special type of believers 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.040
 of which he was pleased that 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.110
 they did not eat everything the apostle 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.300
 is the heart of summers has almost 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.980
 disappeared today people leave the 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.380
 churches without having examined what 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.600
 I listen and go home quietly made 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.250
 17 11 says that they were more open 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.620
 to hear the word of God and in 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.540
 check received the teaching because 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.390
 loved the word and scrutinized each 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.250
 day they did not eat everything they heard Pablo 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.380
 he was not offended maybe he told him so 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.660
 look at them like these are more understood 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.120
 he preached to them and they checked with the 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.550
 scriptures did not have the bibles today 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.550
 but scrolls unrolls them go for 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.630
 read and corroborate and many were saved 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.430
 Now that Jesus says about the 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.160
 discernment Jesus rebuked the 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.540
 Pharisees for their lack of discernment 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.120
 they were the ones in charge of interpreting 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.530
 the law scrutinize the break it down were 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.900
 very religious but they did not have 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.790
 discernment confused things 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.550
 attributed spiritual power to 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.470
 ceremonies Jesus asked them questions 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.120
 I was thinking and thinking and 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.920
 They soon understood but how they were 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.380
 rooted in their beliefs had 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.330
 problems with jesus jesus rebuked them 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.610
 for knowing how to discern the aspect of heaven 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.009
 but not the times waited for the messiah 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.869
 and they did not believe still having it in front 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:38.210
 Today people in the world is 

00:05:35.869 --> 00:05:40.309
 discernment or because to consciousness 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.900
 cauterized they call maturity because to 

00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:43.969
 the lack of absolute values 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.860
 they call an open criterion to the use of 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:47.779
 condom in fornication call it sex 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.059
 responsible to the materialist they call 

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:52.669
 Successful man and the intellectual atheist 

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:54.649
 how much discernment, but they have not 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:57.020
 seen the lack of discernment inside 

00:05:54.649 --> 00:05:59.360
 from the churches to the faithful follower of Jesus 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.520
 libertine is called a fanatic 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.680
 they call being under grace to fill a 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.210
 stadium is called revival to the 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.430
 false doctrine is called new 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:10.129
 revelation to the ravenous wolf they call 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:12.139
 pastor minister servant of god 

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:14.749
 philosophies of the world infiltrate easy 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:16.610
 in the churches and nobody says anything not if 

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:19.460
 we can call this discernment 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:21.289
 good Christians are responsible 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.779
 to scrutinize the writing as he commanded 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:25.939
 jesus then we study the reads as 

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:28.449
 Solomon let's ask God's heart wise and 

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:28.449
 it is understood
