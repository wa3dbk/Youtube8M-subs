00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
in our first bucket of moisture control

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.060 
in our first bucket of moisture control
looks<00:00:54.770> like<00:00:54.920> we<00:00:55.070> got<00:00:55.219> four<00:00:56.380> or<00:00:57.380> shoot<00:00:57.649> so<00:00:57.890> all

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
looks like we got four or shoot so all

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.060 
looks like we got four or shoot so all
four<00:00:58.280> seeds<00:00:58.610> that<00:00:58.790> we<00:00:58.940> planted<00:00:59.739> sprout<00:01:00.739> it<00:01:00.950> up

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
four seeds that we planted sprout it up

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.889 
four seeds that we planted sprout it up
here<00:01:01.840> looks<00:01:02.840> like<00:01:02.989> these<00:01:03.170> two<00:01:03.230> back<00:01:03.800> here

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:04.899 
here looks like these two back here

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:07.149 
here looks like these two back here
these<00:01:05.899> two<00:01:06.109> right<00:01:06.319> here<00:01:06.350> are<00:01:06.770> the<00:01:06.859> ones<00:01:07.069> that

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
these two right here are the ones that

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.639 
these two right here are the ones that
we<00:01:07.340> soak<00:01:07.639> the<00:01:07.850> seeds<00:01:08.149> and<00:01:08.630> these<00:01:09.200> two<00:01:09.439> right

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
we soak the seeds and these two right

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:10.989 
we soak the seeds and these two right
here<00:01:09.679> are<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.009> ones<00:01:10.159> we<00:01:10.280> didn't<00:01:10.609> soak<00:01:10.819> the

00:01:10.989 --> 00:01:10.999 
here are the ones we didn't soak the

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:13.840 
here are the ones we didn't soak the
seeds<00:01:11.859> it<00:01:12.859> doesn't<00:01:13.159> really<00:01:13.280> tell<00:01:13.490> us<00:01:13.520> much<00:01:13.639> of

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
seeds it doesn't really tell us much of

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.209 
seeds it doesn't really tell us much of
anything<00:01:14.179> though<00:01:14.539> I<00:01:14.569> mean<00:01:15.020> the<00:01:15.380> smallest<00:01:15.950> one

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:16.219 
anything though I mean the smallest one

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:18.550 
anything though I mean the smallest one
wasn't<00:01:16.729> soaked<00:01:17.060> but<00:01:17.450> the<00:01:17.600> one<00:01:17.749> that<00:01:17.929> also

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
wasn't soaked but the one that also

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.029 
wasn't soaked but the one that also
wasn't<00:01:19.369> soaked<00:01:19.819> as<00:01:20.090> just<00:01:20.329> as<00:01:20.479> big<00:01:20.719> as<00:01:20.959> the<00:01:21.859> two

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
wasn't soaked as just as big as the two

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:24.819 
wasn't soaked as just as big as the two
that<00:01:22.219> were<00:01:22.869> although<00:01:23.869> this<00:01:24.049> is<00:01:24.229> this<00:01:24.590> is<00:01:24.740> the

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:24.829 
that were although this is this is the

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:25.989 
that were although this is this is the
biggest<00:01:25.130> one<00:01:25.189> right<00:01:25.310> here<00:01:25.639> this<00:01:25.759> is<00:01:25.819> probably

00:01:25.989 --> 00:01:25.999 
biggest one right here this is probably

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:29.230 
biggest one right here this is probably
the<00:01:26.149> one<00:01:26.329> I'm<00:01:26.420> going<00:01:26.569> to<00:01:26.659> keep<00:01:27.789> and<00:01:28.789> then<00:01:28.969> over

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
the one I'm going to keep and then over

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.989 
the one I'm going to keep and then over
in<00:01:29.359> our<00:01:29.539> potting<00:01:30.349> mix<00:01:31.599> these<00:01:32.599> two<00:01:32.899> back<00:01:33.170> here

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:33.999 
in our potting mix these two back here

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:40.300 
in our potting mix these two back here
we<00:01:34.999> run<00:01:35.240> soaked<00:01:35.689> seeds<00:01:36.200> and<00:01:37.659> these<00:01:38.659> two<00:01:39.590> maybe

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
we run soaked seeds and these two maybe

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.260 
we run soaked seeds and these two maybe
just<00:01:40.579> the<00:01:40.729> one<00:01:41.319> were<00:01:42.319> so<00:01:42.829> wherever<00:01:43.789> the<00:01:43.999> seat

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
just the one were so wherever the seat

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.649 
just the one were so wherever the seat
is<00:01:44.419> right<00:01:44.689> here<00:01:45.109> it<00:01:45.439> didn't<00:01:46.179> it<00:01:47.179> didn't<00:01:47.479> sprout

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659
