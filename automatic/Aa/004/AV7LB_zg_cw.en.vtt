 very nice and if you see that I bring your hands 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.860
 dirty is because I'm grabbing the most 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.750
 such and such and a little bit of perfect 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.479
 more with that happens to me now in Egypt and 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.390
 I want to graph the pumpkin flower 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:11.050
 Now the pumpkin flower begins 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:14.320
 the rain starts and suddenly the salts 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.490
 which is a delight then I have 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.500
 said many people that the flower and 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.530
 cancel can use one I want 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.500
 I suggest you buy it low 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.440
 remove this part completely he died 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.260
 and the little one and this is what we 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.020
 comes to embitter sometimes this 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.690
 is here that would be called the pistil to 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.930
 see then decide this in my style 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.880
 for out exactly the straw is that 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.560
 for her and already with the as a nation now 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.510
 I'm not going to sting her because she did not sting her 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.410
 because it's going to be nothing to me then that's what 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.670
 I do with the last moment you will lose 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.190
 the tomatoes as we know are a 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.960
 little bit discolored we can see it and the 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.180
 challenge of adding things 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.790
 you're going to want to do what you 've always done 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.770
 that never anything of course I'm going to leave 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.770
 that the tomato be colored 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.030
 so many of the grandmothers are 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.680

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:14.659

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:31.579
 to keep it a little bit here where I 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.459
 seasoning or lamas and is ok the little one not the 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:36.019

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.530
 a perfect combination more so that 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:51.540
 I was going to see what we 're going to do 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:55.030

 when we put them in the most in the soup 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:07.959
 we are a little bit left a little 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.630

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.989

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.050
 tomato begins to know begins to 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.660
