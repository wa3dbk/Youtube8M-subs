 we are waiting for the coal to 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.690
 start to form the ember by then 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.550
 over the coal, throw herbs 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.550
 aromatic as rosemary 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.990

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.200
 here 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.220
 you suppose that taking out the leg of 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.080
 ham and steak 'not a good cut of 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.620
 ham center a criollo to the Puerto Rican 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.620
 maunabo 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.740
 good now 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.300
 I want to tell you that we have finished the 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.300
 project to do 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.800
 equally 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:11.150
 we have traveled that intense journey through 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.860
 all stages we will return to 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.860
 do and now to enjoy 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.360
 we have started some small cans 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:29.140
 wonderful 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:31.860
 the texture is delicious aroma 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.860
 smell the color 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.739
 wonderful the process is a process 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:42.390
 very interesting because you had to have 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:46.310
 special care special care in 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.390
 when you threw the coal because 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.250
 remember that this is in the process of 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.190
 smoked we were not going to not going to cook 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.560
 the leg is not cooked anymore so the 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.239
 coal has to lie down and watch 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.890
 first do not turn off because you have 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.540
 to be constantly casting 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.209
 way that once I 'm still 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.769
 on we start to throw twigs 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.380
 of rosemary another half of fresh oregano 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.910
 so that smoke that process the 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.180
 smoked could the aromas of these 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.549
 aromatic herbs and then every two 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.620
 candle hours let's look at the coal 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.420
 to make sure that it was not consumed 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.000
 completely because we could not go back 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.579
 to light the coal so we throw a 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.980
 little coal every two hours the process 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.780
 during the party was without any 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.079
 absolutely no problem 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.079
 difficulty 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.500
 more than now 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.180
 mariana 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.240
 life 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:12.189
 Lift the face the lid covers the same 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.570
 and then in the evening when the guests 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.010
 the body then I put the watch 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.920
 alarm clock every two hours 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.720
 I got up, I checked, you were fine 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.960
 with coal 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.100
 so it would be the mixer today at that 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.710
 10 am 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.390
 there was 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.820
 just as I have told you that it is a 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:41.310
 pity that the audiovisual medium that we 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:45.510
 lets make this story that we 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:48.180
 allow to transmit the aromas and flavor 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.510
 spectacular that we have obtained from these 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.510
 recipes 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.250
 we want to thank all 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:58.050
 friends who participated in this project 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:01.080
 that made it possible for us to have 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:04.639
 although we have raised and what 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.639
 It has been a unique experience 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:23.430
 It's 10 in the morning on Sunday 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:27.500
 that is to say now we are going to the happy ending 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.500
 of the leg of ham come with us 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:40.530
 we have already uncovered the pasta and the night 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:43.260
 we went every two hours feeding the 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:45.630
 fire throwing few amounts so that 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:50.960
 it will not be turned off and here as you can see 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:50.960
 we have the result of the leg of ham 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.710
 two 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.950
 what has recorded what is below in the 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.900
 meat 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:13.390
 my people 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:16.260
 the a good if we're going to get out of here 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.260
 leaves by seat 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:25.300
 can see it is assumed that the one that is 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.759
 filming would not be because the laughs of 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.460
 sources that are well heard until 

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:34.330
 we have the roasted toast here we have 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:36.759
 that is real 6.009 very rich is 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:39.070
 delicious so now I'm going to 

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:41.080
 put on the leg ham was 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:43.330
 on the table mulberry with knife 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.639
 ham and I'll start it at the 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:48.810
 to enjoy this first adventure 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:48.810
 of the leg of ham 

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:07.070
 here we have it 

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:07.070
 Y 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:17.020
 to them from which it seems that 

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:17.020
 what 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.060
 preface 

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:38.810
 so we can start with that are some 

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:44.340
 soft forts that one is taking the 

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:46.610
 very thin so that Serrano ham 

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:49.610
 in italy the product then go 

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.610
 working
