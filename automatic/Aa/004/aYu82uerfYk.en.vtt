 it is simpler to use gelatine in 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.840
 sheets usually sold in sheets of 2 or 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.250

 with all the other ingredients so 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:52.119

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.119
 by half a centimeter the fruit 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.480
 anything

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.770
 orange in the mold and let that 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.160
 take consistency in the refrigerator for 15 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.440
 minutes 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.310

 freezer 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.140
 otherwise it would crystallize and the 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.790
 gelatin would be dull we maintain 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.010
 the rest of the orange jelly a 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.860
 room temperature so you don't 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.930
 cools when the gelatin of the

 container in the refrigerator has hardened 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.130
 we add the data of the different fruits 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.130
 and pour the rest of the jelly 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.670
