00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 the karlsruher sc 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.610
 wildlife Park 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.760
 powered by bathing 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.760
 dv 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.940
 we controlled the game and 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.380
 nevertheless again slight errors in the 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.550
 we had good possession 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.310
 many things have defended correctly 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.480
 but then have the again and again 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.160
 opponents also invited 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.220
 fast and easy forward 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.040
 play and score a goal 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.840
 From this we will draw our lessons 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.520
 we saw that was too 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.900
 Not where we are at the end of the season 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.660
 there was still a bit missing 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:44.530
 But I'm optimistic that we will 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.150
 can show here tomorrow and we will 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.590
 of course, all these are also doing this 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.469
 series that we have started now 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.340
 continue to expand and here victorious 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:53.340
 to be against Bielefeld 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.160
 Kevin has done well 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.090
 be involved in tenants and thus 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.530
 then involved in the goal but 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:13.250
 not alone was there before and 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.659
 after that I also involved guys with me 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.950
 think that is also normal that then 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.590
 still voting problems or sometimes 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.640
 but slight errors happen 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.420
 Overall, has made a good game 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.590
 He showed that the reason why 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.040
 have also justified 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.409
 was 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.330
 his body was over his pace 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.170
 he does not attach well to the front 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.940
 then even played a goal 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.550
 shot 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.110
 so we assume I go 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.410
 assuming that tomorrow he too 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.410
 use comes 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:50.720
 fabian klos with 14 goals clear 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.270
 Top scorer of the league still have 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.680
 sometimes refilled in sebastian glasner 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.340
 again brought a scorer 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.369
 yes, he also proved that in the away game 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.229
 in the end a chance was enough 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:07.130
 um and concern first ripped off 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.690
 striker is very variable in the conclusion 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.820
 Can with his feet but also in the 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.610
 head meet 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.770
 yes, but nevertheless we make ourselves 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.120
 forward in the pants we have against 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.880
 otherwise the best defense and are in the 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.980
 yes, also able to turn off every opponent 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.290
 we are not alone on the 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.560
 pokalspiele was also thinking of it 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.520
 I had boys who have the class 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.280
 and yes can stand it as 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.600
 Team and Bielefeld is easy 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.120
 so the ju's do it little 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.410
 is therefore possibilities gates made the 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.019
 what they particularly distinguished 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.950
 otherwise you have noticed how much like 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.290
 little difference between the 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.700
 crews relatively tight but each 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.980
 Team has your quality and that is 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.500
 the quality of Bielefeld that you 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.230
 just have patience know you have 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.450
 also someone ahead of the choice of little 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.620
 Opportunities meets and that is already one 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:00.860
