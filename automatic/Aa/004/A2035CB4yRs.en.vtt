00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.039
 This is an improved model in the past 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.219
 version rk3188 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.610
 well , some changes were made 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.190
 there is increased the frequency of the processor to 18 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.840
 gigahertz leader is left only but 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.050
 performance as the company promises 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.820
 increased 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.520
 let's see now what are you 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.520
 represents the tablet itself in the package 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:01:05.729
 the tablet has a large screen this is 97 90 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:11.240
 water is also two gigabytes of operational 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:13.260
 memory as far as I know from me 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.400
 tablet from version 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.630
 wi-fi that is without 3g although I heard that 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.009
 and sold 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.009

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.000
 tablet itself 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:47.080
 most likely one is the power supply here 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.080
 he power supply and 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:58.920

 thousand 500 milliamps 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:31.380
