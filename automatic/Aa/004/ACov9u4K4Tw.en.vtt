finished<00:01:54.119> look<00:01:54.330> I<00:01:54.600> also<00:01:54.840> applied<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.320> layer<00:01:55.530> of

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
finished look I also applied a layer of

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.719 
finished look I also applied a layer of
stain<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.159> then<00:01:56.759> polyurethane<00:01:58.399> this<00:01:59.399> design

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
stain and then polyurethane this design

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.420 
stain and then polyurethane this design
saves<00:02:00.000> space<00:02:00.180> in<00:02:00.509> two<00:02:00.690> ways<00:02:01.009> first<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.250> keys

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
saves space in two ways first the keys

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.830 
saves space in two ways first the keys
are<00:02:02.549> all<00:02:02.640> mounted<00:02:02.820> parallel<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.540> each<00:02:03.659> other

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
are all mounted parallel to each other

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.680 
are all mounted parallel to each other
and<00:02:04.020> don't<00:02:04.229> fan<00:02:04.470> out<00:02:05.030> secondly<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.390> double

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
and don't fan out secondly the double

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.210 
and don't fan out secondly the double
folding<00:02:07.020> design<00:02:07.290> allows<00:02:07.560> for<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.830> blades<00:02:08.069> of

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
folding design allows for the blades of

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.859 
folding design allows for the blades of
both<00:02:08.399> sets<00:02:08.610> of<00:02:08.759> keys<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.030> all<00:02:09.300> fit<00:02:09.539> within<00:02:09.690> the

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
both sets of keys to all fit within the

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.040 
both sets of keys to all fit within the
space<00:02:10.110> of<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.350> handle<00:02:11.420> this<00:02:12.420> design<00:02:12.750> is<00:02:12.900> also

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
space of the handle this design is also

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.740 
space of the handle this design is also
a<00:02:13.200> better<00:02:13.440> way<00:02:13.560> of<00:02:13.590> organizing<00:02:14.250> keys<00:02:14.750> because

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
a better way of organizing keys because

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.000 
a better way of organizing keys because
the<00:02:15.989> keys<00:02:16.170> are<00:02:16.200> O's<00:02:16.410> in<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.650> same<00:02:16.830> orientation

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
the keys are O's in the same orientation

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.250 
the keys are O's in the same orientation
it's<00:02:17.790> faster<00:02:18.239> and<00:02:18.269> easier<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.780> find<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.080> keys

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
it's faster and easier to find the keys

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.430 
it's faster and easier to find the keys
that<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.530> need<00:02:20.780> well<00:02:21.780> thanks<00:02:21.989> for<00:02:22.080> watching

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
that you need well thanks for watching

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.809 
that you need well thanks for watching
and<00:02:22.650> check<00:02:22.860> back<00:02:22.920> next<00:02:23.100> week<00:02:23.519> for<00:02:23.550> more

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
and check back next week for more

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.300 
and check back next week for more
