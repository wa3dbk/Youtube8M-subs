survivability of our war fighters will

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.630 
survivability of our war fighters will
continue<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.619> train<00:00:31.830> our<00:00:32.009> soldiers<00:00:32.219> and

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
continue to train our soldiers and

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.190 
continue to train our soldiers and
increase<00:00:32.880> their<00:00:33.059> proficiency<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.780> success

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
increase their proficiency and success

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:47.450 
increase their proficiency and success
combat<00:00:34.890> operations<00:00:35.399> overseas

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.369 

this<00:00:48.460> is<00:00:48.579> called<00:00:48.789> a<00:00:48.879> sea<00:00:49.090> tail<00:00:49.360> it's<00:00:49.809> a<00:00:49.960> thermal

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
this is called a sea tail it's a thermal

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:52.950 
this is called a sea tail it's a thermal
capable<00:00:51.160> laser<00:00:51.370> here<00:00:51.910> so<00:00:52.149> this<00:00:52.300> laser<00:00:52.570> here<00:00:52.870> is

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
capable laser here so this laser here is

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.560 
capable laser here so this laser here is
kind<00:00:53.140> of<00:00:53.170> like<00:00:53.320> your<00:00:53.410> PEC<00:00:53.589> 15<00:00:53.980> but<00:00:54.570> drifting

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
kind of like your PEC 15 but drifting

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.810 
kind of like your PEC 15 but drifting
away<00:00:55.690> from<00:00:55.839> viewing<00:00:56.289> night<00:00:56.829> vision<00:00:57.219> because

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
away from viewing night vision because

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.700 
away from viewing night vision because
now<00:00:58.059> everyone<00:00:58.750> overseas<00:00:59.230> has<00:00:59.469> night<00:00:59.620> vision

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
now everyone overseas has night vision

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.289 
now everyone overseas has night vision
the<00:00:59.980> bad<00:01:00.129> guys<00:01:00.339> have<00:01:00.519> it<00:01:00.670> too

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:01.299 
the bad guys have it too

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:03.990 
the bad guys have it too
so<00:01:01.809> in<00:01:02.140> today's<00:01:02.350> kind<00:01:02.710> of<00:01:02.860> combat<00:01:03.190> bad<00:01:03.820> guys

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
so in today's kind of combat bad guys

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.609 
so in today's kind of combat bad guys
are<00:01:04.119> just<00:01:04.239> as<00:01:04.390> likely<00:01:04.420> to<00:01:04.780> have<00:01:04.899> body<00:01:05.199> armor

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
are just as likely to have body armor

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:07.950 
are just as likely to have body armor
and<00:01:05.649> night<00:01:06.009> vision<00:01:06.190> and<00:01:06.960> sophisticated

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
and night vision and sophisticated

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.680 
and night vision and sophisticated
optics<00:01:08.290> just<00:01:08.560> as<00:01:08.680> much<00:01:08.830> as<00:01:08.979> good<00:01:09.159> guys<00:01:09.369> are<00:01:09.690> so

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
optics just as much as good guys are so

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.660 
optics just as much as good guys are so
this<00:01:10.869> takes<00:01:11.680> you<00:01:11.770> a<00:01:11.830> different<00:01:12.130> level<00:01:12.220> with<00:01:12.520> it

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
this takes you a different level with it

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.430 
this takes you a different level with it
by<00:01:12.820> going<00:01:13.119> into<00:01:13.240> a<00:01:13.360> wavelength<00:01:13.869> of<00:01:14.080> thermal

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
by going into a wavelength of thermal

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.100 
by going into a wavelength of thermal
imaging<00:01:14.560> that<00:01:15.430> nobody<00:01:16.090> really<00:01:16.360> has<00:01:16.509> access<00:01:16.960> to

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
imaging that nobody really has access to

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:41.710 
imaging that nobody really has access to
other<00:01:17.320> than<00:01:17.470> the<00:01:17.530> United<00:01:17.649> States

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.510 

we're<00:01:42.720> going<00:01:42.870> to<00:01:42.930> do<00:01:43.050> here<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.650> clear<00:01:44.280> this

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
we're going to do here is clear this

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.920 
we're going to do here is clear this
room<00:01:44.850> with<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.570> assistance<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.290> laser<00:01:46.740> device

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.610 

aggressive<00:01:54.910> stance<00:01:55.090> this<00:01:55.840> allows<00:01:56.170> me<00:01:56.350> to<00:01:56.380> fire

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
aggressive stance this allows me to fire

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.790 
aggressive stance this allows me to fire

so thanks a lot it showed me a lot about

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.260 
so thanks a lot it showed me a lot about
my<00:04:01.569> deficiencies<00:04:02.520> it<00:04:03.520> taught<00:04:03.970> me<00:04:04.000> a<00:04:04.120> lot<00:04:04.209> about

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
my deficiencies it taught me a lot about

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.839 
my deficiencies it taught me a lot about
my<00:04:04.540> transitions<00:04:05.170> and<00:04:05.500> how<00:04:06.190> I<00:04:06.250> should<00:04:06.400> go<00:04:06.610> about

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
my transitions and how I should go about

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.729 
my transitions and how I should go about
trying<00:04:07.660> to<00:04:07.690> transition<00:04:08.200> from<00:04:08.230> target<00:04:08.680> to
