00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
and it's one less thing you've got to

spray<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.789> little<00:00:36.090> bit<00:00:36.239> into<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.019> towel<00:00:37.289> like

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
spray a little bit into a towel like

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.619 
spray a little bit into a towel like
this<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.100> then<00:00:38.550> you'll<00:00:38.670> actually<00:00:39.030> rub<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.480> on

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
this and then you'll actually rub it on

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:40.910 
this and then you'll actually rub it on
we're<00:00:39.989> gonna<00:00:40.079> use<00:00:40.320> this<00:00:40.530> little<00:00:40.739> piece<00:00:40.890> of

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
we're gonna use this little piece of

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.220 
we're gonna use this little piece of
glass<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.579> we're<00:00:42.300> gonna<00:00:42.390> treat<00:00:42.719> this<00:00:42.989> side

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
glass and we're gonna treat this side

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.509 
glass and we're gonna treat this side
that<00:00:43.440> I'm<00:00:43.589> treating<00:00:43.920> right<00:00:44.070> now<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.429> we're

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519 
that I'm treating right now and we're

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:46.009 
that I'm treating right now and we're
gonna<00:00:44.579> leave<00:00:44.820> this<00:00:44.969> side<00:00:45.210> alone<00:00:45.539> it's

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:46.019 
gonna leave this side alone it's

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:47.660 
gonna leave this side alone it's
actually<00:00:46.410> gonna<00:00:46.530> be<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.769> nice<00:00:47.070> little<00:00:47.460> example

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
actually gonna be a nice little example

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.880 
actually gonna be a nice little example
of<00:00:48.239> how<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:48.839> rain-x<00:00:49.230> works<00:00:49.559> now<00:00:49.800> I've

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
of how this rain-x works now I've

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.950 
of how this rain-x works now I've
already<00:00:50.089> treated<00:00:51.089> this<00:00:51.179> side<00:00:51.390> once<00:00:51.629> because

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
already treated this side once because

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.750 
already treated this side once because
you<00:00:52.079> want<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.320> treat<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.530> one<00:00:52.769> time<00:00:53.039> let<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.609> get

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
you want to treat it one time let it get

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.459 
you want to treat it one time let it get
up<00:00:53.879> hazed<00:00:54.300> up<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.659> little<00:00:54.809> bit<00:00:55.019> and<00:00:55.170> then<00:00:55.260> rub

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
up hazed up a little bit and then rub

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.569 
up hazed up a little bit and then rub
that<00:00:55.589> off<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:55.949> then<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.100> want<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.370> do<00:00:56.489> it

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
that off and then you want to do it

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.000 
that off and then you want to do it
again<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:56.850> want<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.179> be<00:00:57.350> better<00:00:58.350> safe<00:00:58.800> than

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
again you want to be better safe than

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.979 
again you want to be better safe than
sorry<00:00:59.069> so<00:00:59.579> here<00:00:59.819> we<00:01:00.120> go<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.569> we'll<00:01:00.719> get<00:01:00.809> this

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
sorry so here we go so we'll get this

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.840 
sorry so here we go so we'll get this
and<00:01:01.260> then<00:01:01.679> we'll<00:01:01.859> be<00:01:01.890> able<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.280> take<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.519> look<00:01:02.760> at

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
and then we'll be able to take a look at

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.369 
and then we'll be able to take a look at
this<00:01:02.969> now<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.210> may<00:01:03.449> not<00:01:03.659> realize<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.140> but

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
this now you may not realize this but

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.410 
this now you may not realize this but
the<00:01:04.680> way<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.070> rain-x<00:01:05.399> actually<00:01:05.880> works<00:01:06.149> is

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
the way the rain-x actually works is

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.539 
the way the rain-x actually works is
glass<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.290> porous<00:01:07.860> which<00:01:08.070> means<00:01:08.310> there's<00:01:08.460> a

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
glass is porous which means there's a

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.830 
glass is porous which means there's a
bunch<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:08.939> little<00:01:09.180> holes<00:01:09.420> in<00:01:09.630> there<00:01:09.750> it

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
bunch of little holes in there it

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.120 
bunch of little holes in there it
doesn't<00:01:09.960> look<00:01:10.110> like<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.470> but<00:01:10.770> they're<00:01:10.950> there

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
doesn't look like it but they're there

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.249 
doesn't look like it but they're there
and<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.369> can<00:01:11.820> tell<00:01:12.030> when<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.570> spray<00:01:12.869> on<00:01:13.049> some

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
and you can tell when you spray on some

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:14.480 
and you can tell when you spray on some
water<00:01:13.439> like<00:01:13.649> we're<00:01:13.829> gonna<00:01:13.950> do<00:01:14.130> right<00:01:14.310> now<00:01:14.340> you

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
water like we're gonna do right now you

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.100 
water like we're gonna do right now you
spray<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.570> look<00:01:15.659> at<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:15.960> just

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
spray that and you look at it just

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.929 
spray that and you look at it just
rolling<00:01:16.560> off<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:17.159> water<00:01:17.399> over<00:01:17.670> here<00:01:17.850> is

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
rolling off the water over here is

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.179 
rolling off the water over here is
hanging<00:01:18.360> on<00:01:18.479> it's<00:01:18.990> not<00:01:19.229> going<00:01:19.530> anywhere<00:01:19.560> you

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
hanging on it's not going anywhere you

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.950 
hanging on it's not going anywhere you
can't<00:01:20.460> see<00:01:20.729> through<00:01:20.969> it<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.299> like<00:01:21.659> we<00:01:21.780> said

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
can't see through it and like we said

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.480 
can't see through it and like we said
you<00:01:21.990> just<00:01:22.229> want<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.530> rain<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.740> end<00:01:23.040> but<00:01:23.280> over

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
you just want that rain to end but over

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.840 
you just want that rain to end but over
here

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
here

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.630 
here
it's<00:01:24.060> good<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.329> clear<00:01:24.860> so<00:01:25.860> we<00:01:25.979> also<00:01:26.159> talked

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
it's good and clear so we also talked

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.149 
it's good and clear so we also talked
about<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:27.060> porous<00:01:27.509> nature<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:28.530> this<00:01:28.649> and<00:01:28.920> we

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
about the porous nature of this and we

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.350 
about the porous nature of this and we
can<00:01:29.310> actually<00:01:29.490> take<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.909> look<00:01:30.090> at<00:01:30.210> this

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
can actually take a look at this

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.359 
can actually take a look at this
scientifically<00:01:31.110> since<00:01:31.770> we're<00:01:31.920> in<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.039> lab<00:01:32.189> we

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
scientifically since we're in a lab we

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.649 
scientifically since we're in a lab we
might<00:01:32.490> as<00:01:32.610> well<00:01:32.670> do<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.850> little<00:01:33.060> experiment

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
might as well do a little experiment

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.209 
might as well do a little experiment
right<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.200> we'll<00:01:34.350> drive<00:01:34.530> this<00:01:34.710> off<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.159> we'll

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:35.219 
right so we'll drive this off and we'll

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:36.620 
right so we'll drive this off and we'll
actually<00:01:35.549> put<00:01:35.729> some<00:01:35.909> more<00:01:36.060> water<00:01:36.299> on<00:01:36.479> there

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
actually put some more water on there

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.170 
actually put some more water on there
and<00:01:36.750> show<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.070> about<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.729> way<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:38.909> it's

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
and show you about the the way that it's

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.029 
and show you about the the way that it's
all<00:01:39.299> pour<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:39.719> let<00:01:39.869> me<00:01:39.930> reach<00:01:40.110> in<00:01:40.320> here<00:01:40.590> grab

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
all pour so let me reach in here grab

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:43.310 
all pour so let me reach in here grab
some<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.340> this<00:01:41.490> ah<00:01:41.759> yes<00:01:42.570> that's<00:01:42.750> nice

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
some of this ah yes that's nice

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.940 
some of this ah yes that's nice
that's<00:01:43.649> nice<00:01:44.240> okay<00:01:45.439> what<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:46.469> want<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.740> show<00:01:46.890> you

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
that's nice okay what I want to show you

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.429 
that's nice okay what I want to show you
here<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.549> fact<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.719> size<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.320> the

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
here is the fact that the size of the

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.200 
here is the fact that the size of the
drops<00:01:49.770> makes<00:01:50.280> all<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.700> difference<00:01:50.820> in<00:01:51.149> the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
drops makes all the difference in the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.209 
drops makes all the difference in the
world<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.719> you<00:01:51.780> can<00:01:51.930> see<00:01:52.140> how<00:01:52.320> this<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:52.770> really

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:53.219 
world and you can see how this is really

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:54.920 
world and you can see how this is really
spread<00:01:53.640> out<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.030> gotten<00:01:54.210> thin<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.689> it's<00:01:54.780> in<00:01:54.899> a

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
spread out and gotten thin and it's in a

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.810 
spread out and gotten thin and it's in a
lot<00:01:55.109> of<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.289> pores<00:01:55.530> this<00:01:56.039> is<00:01:56.100> stayed<00:01:56.429> nice<00:01:56.640> and

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
lot of the pores this is stayed nice and

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.340 
lot of the pores this is stayed nice and
compact<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.359> it's<00:01:57.479> sitting<00:01:57.659> up<00:01:57.840> on<00:01:57.960> top<00:01:58.200> of

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
compact and it's sitting up on top of

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.139 
compact and it's sitting up on top of
the<00:01:58.439> glass<00:01:58.679> and<00:01:58.979> then<00:01:59.460> when<00:01:59.609> you<00:01:59.700> pick<00:01:59.880> this<00:02:00.000> up

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
the glass and then when you pick this up

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.240 
the glass and then when you pick this up
you<00:02:00.299> can<00:02:00.450> really<00:02:00.630> see<00:02:00.929> really<00:02:01.619> see<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.890> magic

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
you can really see really see the magic

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.830 
you can really see really see the magic
I<00:02:02.399> mean<00:02:02.820> look<00:02:02.939> at<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.359> just<00:02:03.420> rolls

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
I mean look at that it just rolls

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.959 
I mean look at that it just rolls
completely<00:02:04.350> off<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.979> trickles<00:02:05.460> off<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:05.820> gets

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
completely off this trickles off it gets

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.550 
completely off this trickles off it gets
caught<00:02:06.149> in<00:02:06.179> more<00:02:06.450> pours<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:06.990> it's<00:02:07.380> just

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
caught in more pours and it's just

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.840 
caught in more pours and it's just
making<00:02:07.740> more<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.160> mess<00:02:08.190> on<00:02:08.460> your<00:02:08.520> windshield

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
making more of a mess on your windshield

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.090 
making more of a mess on your windshield
the<00:02:09.180> rain-x<00:02:09.450> rolls<00:02:09.780> right<00:02:10.050> off<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.950> are

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
the rain-x rolls right off and you are

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.950 
the rain-x rolls right off and you are
seeing<00:02:11.430> good<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:11.820> clear<00:02:12.030> all<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.600> way<00:02:12.720> home

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
seeing good and clear all the way home

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.150 
seeing good and clear all the way home
so<00:02:13.350> that's<00:02:13.560> rain-x

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
so that's rain-x

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.920 
so that's rain-x
that's<00:02:14.280> how<00:02:14.430> easy<00:02:14.460> it<00:02:14.790> is<00:02:15.000> that's<00:02:15.570> how<00:02:15.750> it

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
that's how easy it is that's how it

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.030 
that's how easy it is that's how it
works<00:02:16.350> and<00:02:16.470> this<00:02:16.800> assignment<00:02:17.160> is<00:02:17.580> done
