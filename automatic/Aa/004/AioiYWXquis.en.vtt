Carl thank you so much for joining us

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:03.679 
Carl thank you so much for joining us
just<00:00:02.129> quickly<00:00:02.550> what<00:00:02.820> did<00:00:03.060> you<00:00:03.149> think<00:00:03.360> in

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
just quickly what did you think in

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.710 
just quickly what did you think in
general<00:00:04.049> of<00:00:04.140> all<00:00:04.259> the<00:00:04.350> dressage<00:00:05.420> it's<00:00:06.420> a<00:00:06.480> mixed

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
general of all the dressage it's a mixed

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.410 
general of all the dressage it's a mixed
bag<00:00:07.040> more<00:00:08.040> of<00:00:08.160> a<00:00:08.189> mixed<00:00:08.429> bag<00:00:08.550> than<00:00:08.790> usual<00:00:09.210> I

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
bag more of a mixed bag than usual I

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.190 
bag more of a mixed bag than usual I
think<00:00:09.750> probably<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:11.000> factor<00:00:12.000> that<00:00:12.179> was<00:00:12.420> very

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
think probably the factor that was very

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.169 
think probably the factor that was very
deciding<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:13.889> wherever<00:00:14.160> this<00:00:14.340> places<00:00:14.730> are

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
deciding and wherever this places are

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.460 
deciding and wherever this places are
this<00:00:15.570> flying<00:00:16.440> changes<00:00:17.300> very<00:00:18.300> few<00:00:19.199> riders

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
this flying changes very few riders

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.990 
this flying changes very few riders
actually<00:00:20.070> perform<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.490> were<00:00:20.609> specially<00:00:20.939> on

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
actually perform the were specially on

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.130 
actually perform the were specially on
the<00:00:21.029> second<00:00:21.420> day<00:00:21.510> which<00:00:21.660> was<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.840> little<00:00:21.930> bit

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
the second day which was a little bit

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.370 
the second day which was a little bit
weird<00:00:22.289> so<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.460> think<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.330> question<00:00:24.689> is<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:25.050> the

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
weird so I think the question is is the

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.929 
weird so I think the question is is the
test<00:00:25.650> because<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.039> test<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.369> very<00:00:26.490> different

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
test because the test is very different

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.230 
test because the test is very different
more<00:00:27.060> difficult<00:00:27.539> or<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.580> just<00:00:29.789> because<00:00:30.060> the

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
more difficult or is it just because the

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.880 
more difficult or is it just because the
riders<00:00:30.599> are<00:00:30.750> unable<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.080> do<00:00:31.289> fine<00:00:31.470> changes<00:00:31.800> and

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
riders are unable to do fine changes and

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.250 
riders are unable to do fine changes and
I<00:00:31.949> think<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.340> test<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:32.910> actually<00:00:33.329> much<00:00:34.050> more

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
I think this test is actually much more

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.889 
I think this test is actually much more
difficult<00:00:34.320> so<00:00:35.090> what<00:00:36.090> happens<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.690> first

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
difficult so what happens is the first

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.030 
difficult so what happens is the first
thing<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.290> rider<00:00:37.469> has<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.739> do<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:37.950> an

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
thing that the rider has to do is an

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.639 
thing that the rider has to do is an
extended<00:00:38.489> canter<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.809> flying<00:00:40.140> change<00:00:40.410> we're

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
extended canter to a flying change we're

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.450 
extended canter to a flying change we're
course<00:00:40.879> horses<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.030> sets<00:00:42.300> them<00:00:42.450> off<00:00:42.570> quite

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
course horses that sets them off quite

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.010 
course horses that sets them off quite
Sparky<00:00:44.460> then<00:00:45.120> if<00:00:45.300> you're<00:00:45.480> not<00:00:45.629> very<00:00:45.809> good<00:00:45.870> at

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
Sparky then if you're not very good at

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.779 
Sparky then if you're not very good at
collecting<00:00:46.289> your<00:00:46.620> horse<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.100> have<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.280> wild

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
collecting your horse so you have a wild

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.100 
collecting your horse so you have a wild
flying<00:00:48.030> change<00:00:48.270> at<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.570> end<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.870> then<00:00:48.960> that

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
flying change at the end and then that

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.330 
flying change at the end and then that
seems<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.500> affect<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.800> rest<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.160> fine

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
seems to affect the rest of the fine

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.100 
seems to affect the rest of the fine
changes<00:00:50.789> because<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.539> mean<00:00:51.690> everybody

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
changes because I mean everybody

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.560 
changes because I mean everybody
everybody<00:00:53.039> really<00:00:53.370> can<00:00:53.550> do<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:54.180> truck<00:00:54.390> work

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
everybody really can do the truck work

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.150 
everybody really can do the truck work
the<00:00:54.690> shoulder<00:00:55.020> in<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.140> circle<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.710> hard<00:00:55.890> pass

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
the shoulder in a circle and a hard pass

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.500 
the shoulder in a circle and a hard pass
very<00:00:57.059> few<00:00:57.449> expressive<00:00:58.440> horses<00:00:58.949> in<00:00:59.730> the<00:01:00.239> Trop

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
very few expressive horses in the Trop

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.270 
very few expressive horses in the Trop
but<00:01:00.660> everyone<00:01:01.079> can<00:01:01.379> actually<00:01:01.770> complete<00:01:02.100> that

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
but everyone can actually complete that

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.549 
but everyone can actually complete that
movement<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.809> know<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.110> rain<00:01:04.290> backs

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
movement and you know the rain backs

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.440 
movement and you know the rain backs
always<00:01:05.129> difficult<00:01:05.610> for<00:01:05.729> an<00:01:05.790> event<00:01:06.030> horse<00:01:06.240> I

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
always difficult for an event horse I

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.500 
always difficult for an event horse I
think<00:01:06.689> as<00:01:06.810> well<00:01:06.990> it's<00:01:07.229> quite<00:01:07.500> difficult<00:01:07.770> test

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
think as well it's quite difficult test

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.730 
think as well it's quite difficult test
and<00:01:09.510> we<00:01:09.600> didn't<00:01:09.810> see<00:01:09.900> many<00:01:10.049> good<00:01:10.290> rainbows

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
and we didn't see many good rainbows

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.530 
and we didn't see many good rainbows
because<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.130> losses<00:01:11.460> are<00:01:11.729> quite<00:01:11.970> tense<00:01:12.299> and

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
because the losses are quite tense and

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.750 
because the losses are quite tense and
then<00:01:12.659> with<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.619> extended<00:01:14.100> canter<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.520> start

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
then with this extended canter to start

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:23.560 
then with this extended canter to start
off<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.450> cats<00:01:15.689> work<00:01:16.460> it<00:01:17.460> made<00:01:17.640> things

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.450 

do<00:01:23.659> you<00:01:23.720> think<00:01:23.960> he<00:01:24.110> would<00:01:24.259> have<00:01:24.409> won<00:01:25.040> this<00:01:25.220> year

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
do you think he would have won this year

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.670 
do you think he would have won this year
had<00:01:25.610> he<00:01:25.700> been<00:01:25.820> here<00:01:26.060> and<00:01:26.180> done<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:26.420> test<00:01:26.680> well

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
had he been here and done the test well

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.440 
had he been here and done the test well
you<00:01:27.890> know<00:01:28.040> if<00:01:28.189> it<00:01:28.369> we've<00:01:28.549> done<00:01:28.700> that<00:01:28.850> last<00:01:29.119> year

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
you know if it we've done that last year

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.350 
you know if it we've done that last year
then<00:01:30.170> yes<00:01:30.590> I<00:01:30.830> mean<00:01:30.979> it's<00:01:31.430> you<00:01:31.939> know<00:01:32.060> but<00:01:32.210> there

then yes I mean it's you know but there

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.730 
then yes I mean it's you know but there
have<00:01:32.570> been<00:01:32.600> horses<00:01:33.110> that<00:01:33.259> have<00:01:33.409> done<00:01:33.560> very

have been horses that have done very

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.740 
have been horses that have done very

a<00:01:49.070> great<00:01:49.369> test<00:01:49.700> today

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
a great test today

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:52.990

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
depends how the atmosphere affects them

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:55.660 
depends how the atmosphere affects them
I<00:01:54.440> mean<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:54.709> best<00:01:54.920> movement<00:01:55.190> was<00:01:55.459> Bill

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
I mean the best movement was Bill

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.850 
I mean the best movement was Bill

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.570 
of the mistakes would you ever take any
those<00:02:06.049> event<00:02:06.350> most<00:02:06.500> determined<00:02:07.009> and<00:02:07.069> consider

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
those event most determined and consider

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:17.500 
those event most determined and consider
having<00:02:07.729> the<00:02:07.880> most<00:02:08.000> ressources<00:02:16.330> they're<00:02:17.330> not

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
having the most ressources they're not

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.089 
having the most ressources they're not
supposed<00:02:17.870> to<00:02:17.989> be<00:02:18.140> dressage<00:02:18.560> horses<00:02:18.920> you<00:02:19.069> know

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
supposed to be dressage horses you know

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.270 
supposed to be dressage horses you know
and<00:02:19.640> so<00:02:20.090> I'm<00:02:20.299> not<00:02:20.450> expecting<00:02:20.569> to<00:02:21.170> see<00:02:21.380> you<00:02:22.160> know

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
and so I'm not expecting to see you know

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.750 
and so I'm not expecting to see you know
like<00:02:23.079> really<00:02:24.079> amazing<00:02:24.470> movies<00:02:25.340> out<00:02:25.519> there

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
like really amazing movies out there

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.920 
like really amazing movies out there
because<00:02:25.880> they've<00:02:26.120> got<00:02:26.239> so<00:02:26.420> many<00:02:26.510> other<00:02:26.720> jobs

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
because they've got so many other jobs

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.259 
because they've got so many other jobs
to<00:02:27.140> do<00:02:27.290> but<00:02:27.320> bill<00:02:28.100> bill<00:02:28.370> never<00:02:28.579> sauce<00:02:28.910> was<00:02:29.120> it

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
to do but bill bill never sauce was it

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.090 
to do but bill bill never sauce was it
was<00:02:29.450> a<00:02:29.480> proper<00:02:29.810> movie<00:02:30.200> and<00:02:30.470> if<00:02:30.620> I<00:02:30.739> was<00:02:30.859> going<00:02:31.040> to

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
was a proper movie and if I was going to

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.530 
was a proper movie and if I was going to
take<00:02:31.220> one<00:02:31.459> home<00:02:31.700> it<00:02:31.940> would<00:02:32.090> probably<00:02:32.239> be<00:02:32.510> that

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
take one home it would probably be that

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.690 
take one home it would probably be that
work<00:02:32.810> and<00:02:33.440> you<00:02:33.500> do<00:02:33.769> train<00:02:34.040> a<00:02:34.070> few<00:02:34.310> of<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.519> event

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
work and you do train a few of the event

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.090 
work and you do train a few of the event
is<00:02:34.880> to<00:02:35.060> train<00:02:35.690> them<00:02:35.870> differently<00:02:36.230> to<00:02:36.859> your

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
is to train them differently to your

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.849 
is to train them differently to your
dressing<00:02:37.549> our<00:02:37.640> drivers<00:02:38.030> I<00:02:38.359> mean<00:02:39.290> it's<00:02:39.530> in

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:39.859 
dressing our drivers I mean it's in

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.430 
dressing our drivers I mean it's in
stresses<00:02:40.250> whether<00:02:40.459> it's<00:02:40.670> you<00:02:41.480> know<00:02:41.630> for

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
stresses whether it's you know for

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.810 
stresses whether it's you know for
somebody<00:02:42.590> doing<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:43.010> prison<00:02:43.340> George<00:02:43.489> or

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
somebody doing a prison George or

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.460 
somebody doing a prison George or
somebody<00:02:44.299> this<00:02:44.480> is<00:02:44.540> an<00:02:44.750> advanced<00:02:45.049> medium

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
somebody this is an advanced medium

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.120 
somebody this is an advanced medium
level<00:02:45.739> test<00:02:45.980> so<00:02:46.160> it<00:02:46.280> needs<00:02:46.459> a<00:02:46.549> little<00:02:46.640> bit<00:02:46.850> of

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
level test so it needs a little bit of

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.400 
level test so it needs a little bit of
action<00:02:47.430> in<00:02:47.550> it<00:02:47.670> too<00:02:48.270> as<00:02:48.840> we've<00:02:49.020> seen<00:02:49.200> to

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
action in it too as we've seen to

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.990 
action in it too as we've seen to
actually<00:02:49.710> complete<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.340> movements<00:02:50.820> with

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
actually complete the movements with

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.990 
actually complete the movements with
them<00:02:51.270> with<00:02:51.600> an<00:02:51.720> uphill<00:02:51.990> tendency<00:02:52.730> no<00:02:53.730> there's

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
them with an uphill tendency no there's

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.220 
them with an uphill tendency no there's
no<00:02:54.120> difference<00:02:54.450> in<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.630> training<00:02:54.960> it's<00:02:55.080> just

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
no difference in the training it's just

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.170 
no difference in the training it's just
obviously<00:02:55.530> we<00:02:55.680> don't<00:02:55.830> overtrain<00:02:56.490> it<00:02:56.790> so<00:02:57.000> that

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
obviously we don't overtrain it so that

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.020 
obviously we don't overtrain it so that
the<00:02:57.270> horses<00:02:57.570> get<00:02:57.810> overexcited<00:02:58.440> do<00:02:59.250> you<00:02:59.580> meant
