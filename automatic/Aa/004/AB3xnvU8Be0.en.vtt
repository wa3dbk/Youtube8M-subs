nil remind us of anger score &amp; gell came

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.810 
nil remind us of anger score &amp; gell came
in<00:00:06.509> at<00:00:06.600> 6.86<00:00:07.290> second<00:00:07.799> six<00:00:08.280> point<00:00:08.490> eight<00:00:08.610> six

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
in at 6.86 second six point eight six

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.749 
in at 6.86 second six point eight six
and<00:00:09.059> then<00:00:09.360> ronaldo's<00:00:09.870> six<00:00:10.710> point<00:00:10.950> three<00:00:11.010> five

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
and then ronaldo's six point three five

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.100 
and then ronaldo's six point three five
so<00:00:12.150> what's<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.389> difference<00:00:12.450> they're<00:00:12.840> almost

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
so what's the difference they're almost

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.480 
so what's the difference they're almost
half<00:00:13.530> a<00:00:13.679> second<00:00:14.009> there<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:14.160> it<00:00:14.340> almost

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
half a second there and it almost

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.120 
half a second there and it almost
opposite<00:00:14.940> very<00:00:15.240> super<00:00:15.960> exactly<00:00:16.770> what<00:00:16.890> we<00:00:17.010> have

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
opposite very super exactly what we have

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.769 
opposite very super exactly what we have
expecting<00:00:17.670> from<00:00:17.970> output<00:00:18.119> will<00:00:18.420> look<00:00:18.449> erect

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
expecting from output will look erect

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.320 
expecting from output will look erect
yeah<00:00:19.199> yeah<00:00:19.560> well<00:00:19.949> we<00:00:20.130> hope<00:00:20.279> in<00:00:20.460> there<00:00:20.640> you<00:00:21.180> can

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
yeah yeah well we hope in there you can

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.730 
yeah yeah well we hope in there you can
see<00:00:21.539> very<00:00:21.810> big<00:00:21.990> difference<00:00:22.380> between<00:00:22.650> the

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
see very big difference between the

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.259 
see very big difference between the
straight-line<00:00:23.100> sprinting<00:00:23.580> we've<00:00:23.939> got<00:00:24.060> very

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
straight-line sprinting we've got very

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.960 
straight-line sprinting we've got very

working at their optimum level because

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.959 
working at their optimum level because
this<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.640> my<00:00:39.320> my<00:00:40.320> style<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.860> know<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.550> use

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
this is my my style you know I I use

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.979 
this is my my style you know I I use
this<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.480> lot<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.930> know<00:00:43.079> in<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.559> bridge<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.430> I

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
this a lot you know in the bridge so I

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.100 
this a lot you know in the bridge so I
guess<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.200> I'm<00:00:46.379> more<00:00:47.250> chances<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:48.840> type

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
guess that I'm more chances in this type

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.950 
guess that I'm more chances in this type
of<00:00:49.140> run<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:50.100> straight<00:00:50.730> line<00:00:50.910> shadow<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.899> I

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
of run that straight line shadow that I

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.799 
of run that straight line shadow that I
improved<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:53.000> when<00:00:54.000> we<00:00:54.120> look<00:00:54.239> at<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.420> zigzag

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
improved it when we look at the zigzag

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.139 
improved it when we look at the zigzag
movement<00:00:55.170> we<00:00:55.860> can<00:00:55.980> see<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.309> way<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.699> Cristiano

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
movement we can see a way that Cristiano

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.119 
movement we can see a way that Cristiano
anticipates<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.379> change<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:58.949> direction

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
anticipates the change of direction

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.090 
anticipates the change of direction
coming<00:00:59.969> into<00:01:00.090> play<00:01:00.390> as<00:01:00.750> Cristiano<00:01:01.530> approaches

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
coming into play as Cristiano approaches

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.469 
coming into play as Cristiano approaches
we<00:01:02.399> see<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.609> lot<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:02.820> shorter<00:01:03.300> steps<00:01:05.180> this<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.240> in

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
we see a lot of shorter steps this is in

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.640 
we see a lot of shorter steps this is in
stark<00:01:06.780> contrast<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.470> what<00:01:07.650> we<00:01:07.680> see<00:01:07.920> from<00:01:08.040> angle

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.830 

to<00:01:12.250> change<00:01:12.460> direction<00:01:12.940> he<00:01:13.300> does<00:01:13.480> something

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
to change direction he does something

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.390 
to change direction he does something
that<00:01:13.900> probably<00:01:14.140> most<00:01:14.350> people<00:01:14.800> wouldn't<00:01:15.130> they

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
that probably most people wouldn't they

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.820 
that probably most people wouldn't they
would<00:01:15.640> almost<00:01:16.150> drop<00:01:16.510> down<00:01:16.780> to<00:01:16.990> the<00:01:17.080> ground<00:01:17.110> to

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
would almost drop down to the ground to

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.950 
would almost drop down to the ground to
change<00:01:18.070> movement<00:01:18.610> Chris<00:01:19.180> down<00:01:19.360> and<00:01:19.480> Ronaldo

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
change movement Chris down and Ronaldo

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:32.700 
change movement Chris down and Ronaldo
almost<00:01:20.440> balls<00:01:20.650> up<00:01:20.920> right<00:01:21.310> go<00:01:21.670> Paula<00:01:31.500> look<00:01:32.500> he

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
almost balls up right go Paula look he

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.800 
almost balls up right go Paula look he
jumps<00:01:33.100> into<00:01:33.400> it<00:01:33.760> with<00:01:33.970> two<00:01:34.150> feet<00:01:34.420> this<00:01:34.540> time

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
jumps into it with two feet this time

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.200 
jumps into it with two feet this time
here<00:01:34.990> we<00:01:35.080> go<00:01:35.200> yeah<00:01:35.530> there<00:01:36.070> we<00:01:36.190> go<00:01:36.220> there<00:01:36.550> yeah

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
here we go yeah there we go there yeah

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.670 
here we go yeah there we go there yeah
we<00:01:37.330> could<00:01:37.480> see<00:01:37.600> I'm<00:01:37.750> Gayle<00:01:37.930> using<00:01:38.260> one<00:01:38.440> foot

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
we could see I'm Gayle using one foot

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.500 
we could see I'm Gayle using one foot
there<00:01:38.860> to<00:01:39.040> brick<00:01:39.280> in<00:01:39.580> one<00:01:39.880> stop<00:01:40.240> in<00:01:40.390> one

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
there to brick in one stop in one

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.030 
there to brick in one stop in one
particular<00:01:40.750> stride<00:01:41.290> and<00:01:41.530> to<00:01:41.590> try<00:01:41.770> and<00:01:41.860> push

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
particular stride and to try and push

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.550 
particular stride and to try and push
off<00:01:42.190> in<00:01:42.310> a<00:01:42.370> very<00:01:42.520> next<00:01:42.840> cristianos<00:01:43.840> decelerate

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
off in a very next cristianos decelerate

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.430 
off in a very next cristianos decelerate
using<00:01:44.770> both<00:01:44.979> feet<00:01:45.010> yeah<00:01:45.690> places<00:01:46.690> his<00:01:47.140> center

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
using both feet yeah places his center

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.930 
using both feet yeah places his center
of<00:01:47.500> gravity<00:01:47.560> inside<00:01:48.250> the<00:01:48.369> line<00:01:48.520> of<00:01:48.610> his<00:01:48.700> foot

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
of gravity inside the line of his foot

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.510 
of gravity inside the line of his foot
and<00:01:49.150> all<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:49.720> way<00:01:49.810> god<00:01:50.080> it's<00:01:51.040> almost<00:01:51.250> like<00:01:51.430> he

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
and all the way god it's almost like he

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.580 
and all the way god it's almost like he
uses<00:01:51.700> one<00:01:52.000> foot<00:01:52.210> primarily<00:01:52.780> for<00:01:53.260> taking<00:01:53.530> a

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
uses one foot primarily for taking a

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.109 
uses one foot primarily for taking a
break<00:01:53.770> in<00:01:53.979> force<00:01:54.190> as<00:01:54.340> we<00:01:54.460> see<00:01:54.580> that<00:01:54.700> inside<00:01:54.880> the

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
break in force as we see that inside the
