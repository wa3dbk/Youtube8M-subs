00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.159
 beaver calls that your women presentation video dedicated suit and 

00:00:09.159 --> 00:00:11.309
 the 3ds max 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.059
 we are 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.039
 version 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.039
 so this is the third dedicated volume 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.159
 very powerful rendering engine 

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:25.499
 meeting of this 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:31.249
 masterclass and we will study how it was and behaves in a more interior scene 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:32.660
 complex 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.480
 all through one more 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.200
 clear as always that the advice is to use + g + to benefit 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.870
 of rendering times 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.080
 however they will intervene 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.210
 neon free blog work 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.370
 what is the comparison 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.710
 between a carefully fed scene I would like to connect to you materials 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.290
 lighting 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.720
 it's the same scene with some variations for the materials 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.600
 and the type of lighting inside I would say 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.030
 as always there are files we have 3 file files allow 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.030
 ifaith for who you are with me 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.040
 killer 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.060
 neutral gray material we are seeing now and eventually we will have 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.820
 also 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.860
 the file with the materials already assigned 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.010
 we have about an hour to be together 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.470
 to analyze 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.450
 then these solutions 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.880
 this is a and there will be generated cross mental ray kisses and it is already 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.510
 ready 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.830
 - wright. 9 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:34.760
 this 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.560
 and instead they would be much brighter than it will be created inside 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.220
 I'd say 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.830
 and then we will also see my post-production feces within programs 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.510
 of photos christ com 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.780
 3 2 engine there is certainly a big difference also because there is a type of 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.260
 slightly different special lighting 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.900
 I would say you fully enlighten 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:00.909
 very 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.060
 very 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.030
 performing 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.160
 compare with 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.839
 mental ray really matters out 

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:11.799
 sure some contrast though 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:14.440
 to make it even more dirty 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.440
 some areas 

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:20.180
 as we did 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.279
 in the previous masters of the wounded is her 

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:27.369
 we will observe during the creation of aprender in what they are 

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:29.079
 the stadiums 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:30.519
 to understand 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.219
 what is the moment when we can define this type of quality as one 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:38.209
 satisfactory quality 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.389
 we will have internal 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:42.619
 a folder with me 

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:46.979
 2 very important s that are related 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:49.599
 a 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.019
 progress 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.139
 quality through uplifting interactions as these qualities 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:00.309
 and these interactions continue over time then 

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:04.859
 you if you want a photoshop file you will also find for the singles with me 

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:08.209
 these types of heads that will make you understand 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.019
 such as 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.950
 and how much time is required 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.429
 to generate this 

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:15.239
 quality 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.239
 and you want to receive emotionally in the initial state 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:23.400
 the same thing regarding the rendering of the con 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.609
 colors 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:25.479
 then 

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:27.169
 what does it mean 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:30.199
 also in the glasses file where they are present 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.489
 the materials 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.070
 that we will analyze eyes together 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.749
 the scene the shame we will oppose the application but the seven but 

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:42.969
 we will analyze which materials are applied 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:47.059
 and and oar 

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:48.270
 the contribution 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:49.609
 quality 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:56.049
 in relation to growing cities version and how much time is needed 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.009
 to generate 

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:01.009
 render this 

00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:04.139
 and then we will be giving clearly 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:08.469
 you make the finals that have a higher resolution in the test will be 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:10.150
 made this resolution 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.549
 the criminal files are those we observe here 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.840
 some resolution is certainly a little more important 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:24.039
 I wait for you I thank you 

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:28.189
 greetings 

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:29.229
