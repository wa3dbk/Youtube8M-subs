too<00:02:00.760> far<00:02:00.970> away<00:02:01.060> for<00:02:01.150> that<00:02:01.390> one<00:02:01.540> so<00:02:02.520> bad<00:02:03.550> matter

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
too far away for that one so bad matter

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.540 
too far away for that one so bad matter
and<00:02:04.870> that<00:02:05.380> was<00:02:05.530> a<00:02:05.560> weak<00:02:05.770> attack<00:02:06.130> you<00:02:06.280> can<00:02:06.370> kind

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
and that was a weak attack you can kind

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.220 
and that was a weak attack you can kind
of<00:02:06.580> tell<00:02:06.820> the<00:02:07.150> leaping<00:02:07.480> attack<00:02:09.690> when<00:02:10.690> you<00:02:10.869> kind

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
of tell the leaping attack when you kind

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.960 
of tell the leaping attack when you kind
of<00:02:11.320> winds<00:02:12.040> up<00:02:12.130> a<00:02:12.190> little<00:02:12.340> bit<00:02:12.520> for<00:02:12.700> like<00:02:12.940> a

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
of winds up a little bit for like a

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:13.860 
of winds up a little bit for like a
little<00:02:13.150> leap

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
it's kind of hard a telegraph when

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.800 
it's kind of hard a telegraph when
that's<00:02:47.650> gonna<00:02:47.800> happen<00:02:48.070> so<00:02:48.459> you're<00:02:49.180> but<00:02:49.450> the

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
that's gonna happen so you're but the

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.080 
that's gonna happen so you're but the
best<00:02:49.990> thing<00:02:50.170> to<00:02:50.200> do<00:02:50.350> is<00:02:50.470> just<00:02:50.650> stay<00:02:50.770> away<00:02:50.950> from

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
best thing to do is just stay away from

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.420 
best thing to do is just stay away from
and<00:02:52.440> his<00:02:53.440> moveset<00:02:53.770> doesn't<00:02:54.250> really<00:02:54.370> change

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
and his moveset doesn't really change

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.070 
and his moveset doesn't really change
except<00:02:55.060> this<00:02:55.239> combo<00:02:56.020> attacks<00:02:56.319> way<00:02:56.709> longer<00:02:57.040> and

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
except this combo attacks way longer and

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.440 
except this combo attacks way longer and
it<00:02:59.080> hurts<00:02:59.230> like<00:02:59.319> a<00:02:59.380> bitch<00:02:59.970> he<00:03:00.970> also<00:03:01.180> had<00:03:01.420> a

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
it hurts like a bitch he also had a

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.420 
it hurts like a bitch he also had a
leaping<00:03:01.720> attack<00:03:02.050> what<00:03:02.260> she<00:03:02.380> doesn't<00:03:02.680> do<00:03:03.010> often

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
leaping attack what she doesn't do often

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.850

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
if you just stay right next to him

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.960 
if you just stay right next to him

way I find to take them down if you're

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:27.990 
way I find to take them down if you're
trying<00:03:26.650> to<00:03:26.709> take<00:03:26.950> him<00:03:27.100> down<00:03:27.160> with<00:03:27.400> just<00:03:27.580> pure

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
trying to take him down with just pure

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.240 
trying to take him down with just pure
like<00:03:28.209> hack<00:03:28.780> and<00:03:28.989> slash<00:03:29.230> melee<00:03:29.769> it's<00:03:30.040> gonna

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
like hack and slash melee it's gonna

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.809 
like hack and slash melee it's gonna
take<00:03:30.489> a<00:03:30.519> while<00:03:30.819> it's<00:03:31.000> I<00:03:31.680> find<00:03:32.680> it<00:03:32.890> more<00:03:33.160> harder

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
take a while it's I find it more harder

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.990 
take a while it's I find it more harder
to<00:03:34.150> do<00:03:34.299> that<00:03:34.330> because<00:03:35.019> when<00:03:35.830> he<00:03:35.950> goes<00:03:36.100> and<00:03:36.340> goes

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
to do that because when he goes and goes

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.990 
to do that because when he goes and goes
into<00:03:37.330> his<00:03:37.599> third<00:03:37.959> stage<00:03:38.430> being<00:03:39.430> right<00:03:39.610> next<00:03:39.790> to

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
into his third stage being right next to

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.610 
into his third stage being right next to
him<00:03:40.090> starts<00:03:40.360> poisoning<00:03:40.840> so<00:03:41.080> you're<00:03:41.530> gonna

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
him starts poisoning so you're gonna

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.949 
him starts poisoning so you're gonna
have<00:03:41.830> to<00:03:41.860> like<00:03:42.130> find<00:03:42.700> time<00:03:42.910> for<00:03:42.940> antidote<00:03:43.720> and

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
have to like find time for antidote and

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.140 
have to like find time for antidote and
if<00:03:44.170> he<00:03:44.290> does<00:03:44.500> hit<00:03:44.769> you<00:03:45.010> you're<00:03:45.700> gonna<00:03:45.790> have<00:03:45.940> to

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
if he does hit you you're gonna have to

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.610 
if he does hit you you're gonna have to
find<00:03:46.690> time<00:03:46.959> for<00:03:46.989> the<00:03:47.260> blood<00:03:47.530> vial<00:03:47.799> so<00:03:48.360> if<00:03:49.620> I

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
find time for the blood vial so if I

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.620 
find time for the blood vial so if I
think<00:03:51.220> that's<00:03:51.489> more<00:03:51.640> of<00:03:51.760> a<00:03:51.819> pain<00:03:52.000> to<00:03:52.150> do<00:03:52.299> so

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
think that's more of a pain to do so

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.770 
think that's more of a pain to do so

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
yeah so I find it more easier to just

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.300
