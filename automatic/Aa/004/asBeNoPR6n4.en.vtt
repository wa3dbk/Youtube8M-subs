00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
through it was they played the

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.150 
through it was they played the
subscriber<00:00:39.719> cup<00:00:39.899> winner<00:00:40.050> notorious<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.860> he's

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
subscriber cup winner notorious and he's

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.500 
subscriber cup winner notorious and he's
very<00:00:41.309> good<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.760> they<00:00:42.120> played<00:00:42.270> against

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
very good and they played against

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.930 
very good and they played against
Bateson<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.110> he's<00:00:43.649> also<00:00:43.829> very<00:00:44.160> very<00:00:44.340> good<00:00:44.579> so

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
Bateson and he's also very very good so

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.220 
Bateson and he's also very very good so
I<00:00:45.210> picked<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.600> Liverpool<00:00:45.960> which<00:00:46.079> was

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
I picked the Liverpool which was

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.139 
I picked the Liverpool which was
probably<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.530> stupid<00:00:47.460> move<00:00:47.610> on<00:00:47.700> my<00:00:47.760> behalf<00:00:48.090> but

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
probably a stupid move on my behalf but

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.400 
probably a stupid move on my behalf but
I<00:00:48.360> wanted<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.570> get<00:00:48.660> out<00:00:48.750> one<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.079> weaker

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
I wanted to get out one of the weaker

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.950 
I wanted to get out one of the weaker
get<00:00:49.559> teams<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.910> if<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.120> did<00:00:51.270> be<00:00:51.420> Bateson<00:00:51.840> with

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
get teams so if I did be Bateson with

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.110 
get teams so if I did be Bateson with
Liverpool<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.710> would<00:00:53.670> have<00:00:53.760> been<00:00:53.879> out<00:00:53.910> he's

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
Liverpool I would have been out he's

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.639 
Liverpool I would have been out he's
much<00:00:54.270> stronger<00:00:54.449> teams<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:54.930> through<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.500> rest

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
much stronger teams in through the rest

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.920 
much stronger teams in through the rest
of<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.829> tournament<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.510> order<00:00:57.719> for<00:00:57.750> me<00:00:57.870> to

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
of the tournament and in order for me to

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.590 
of the tournament and in order for me to
advance<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.800> think<00:00:59.399> he<00:00:59.670> can<00:00:59.850> go<00:00:59.940> I<00:00:59.969> think<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.449> can

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
advance I think he can go I think I can

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.689 
advance I think he can go I think I can
lose<00:01:00.780> when<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.050> draw<00:01:01.350> depending<00:01:02.280> on<00:01:02.370> Eva's

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
lose when I draw depending on Eva's

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.740 
lose when I draw depending on Eva's
results<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.300> if<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.480> can<00:01:03.960> lose<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.619> if

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
results so if I can lose and if

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.359 
results so if I can lose and if
notorious<00:01:06.750> beats<00:01:06.960> Bateson<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.560> go<00:01:07.770> through<00:01:08.040> I

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
notorious beats Bateson I go through I

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
so circus playing strong he's got a lot

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.080 
so circus playing strong he's got a lot
of<00:03:40.170> chances<00:03:40.560> so<00:03:40.709> far<00:03:40.950> there's<00:03:41.430> nothing<00:03:41.760> on<00:03:41.970> the

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
of chances so far there's nothing on the

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.610 
of chances so far there's nothing on the
wing<00:03:42.269> that's<00:03:42.420> got<00:03:42.569> a<00:03:42.600> chance<00:03:42.870> and<00:03:43.349> then<00:03:43.470> in<00:03:43.560> the

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
wing that's got a chance and then in the

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.430 
wing that's got a chance and then in the
bottom<00:03:43.800> up<00:03:44.400> for<00:03:44.670> that<00:03:44.819> shot<00:03:45.140> finish<00:03:46.140> Autzen

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
bottom up for that shot finish Autzen

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.509 
bottom up for that shot finish Autzen
hit<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.650> header<00:03:46.800> definitely<00:03:47.190> not<00:03:47.370> as

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
hit the header definitely not as

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.729 
hit the header definitely not as
powerful<00:03:47.550> as<00:03:48.030> they<00:03:48.209> are<00:03:48.330> no<00:03:48.510> absolutely<00:03:49.050> and

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
powerful as they are no absolutely and

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:50.930 
powerful as they are no absolutely and
that's<00:03:49.830> what<00:03:49.980> I'm<00:03:50.040> saying<00:03:50.220> I<00:03:50.340> think<00:03:50.670> quite<00:03:50.880> a

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
that's what I'm saying I think quite a

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.970 
that's what I'm saying I think quite a
few<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.180> guys<00:03:51.330> here<00:03:51.630> play<00:03:52.140> a<00:03:52.170> ton<00:03:52.560> of<00:03:52.590> Ultimate

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
few the guys here play a ton of Ultimate

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.440 
few the guys here play a ton of Ultimate
Team<00:03:53.130> and<00:03:53.340> they<00:03:53.400> haven't<00:03:53.549> adjusted<00:03:53.730> to<00:03:54.330> the

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
Team and they haven't adjusted to the

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.910 
Team and they haven't adjusted to the
pace<00:03:54.630> and<00:03:54.870> there<00:03:55.110> are<00:03:55.260> some<00:03:55.470> changes<00:03:55.590> in

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
pace and there are some changes in

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.190 
pace and there are some changes in
gameplay<00:03:56.100> as<00:03:56.430> well<00:03:59.660> so<00:04:00.660> we're<00:04:00.750> coming<00:04:00.930> up<00:04:01.140> to

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
gameplay as well so we're coming up to

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.630 
gameplay as well so we're coming up to
the<00:04:01.380> end<00:04:01.590> of<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:01.799> half<00:04:01.980> here<00:04:02.220> pretty

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
the end of the half here pretty

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.970 
the end of the half here pretty
one-sided<00:04:03.209> I<00:04:03.660> guess<00:04:03.810> for<00:04:04.019> zhurko's<00:04:04.410> up<00:04:04.739> one

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
one-sided I guess for zhurko's up one

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.860 
one-sided I guess for zhurko's up one
nil<00:04:05.190> had<00:04:05.670> most<00:04:05.880> of<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.090> pressure<00:04:06.330> had<00:04:06.540> most<00:04:06.750> of

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
nil had most of the pressure had most of

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.960 
nil had most of the pressure had most of
the<00:04:06.930> chances<00:04:07.220> so<00:04:08.220> that's<00:04:08.400> a<00:04:08.489> fair<00:04:08.700> a<00:04:08.940> fair

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
the chances so that's a fair a fair

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.660 
the chances so that's a fair a fair
