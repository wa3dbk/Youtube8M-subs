00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
staying for another like 15 minutes just

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.369 
staying for another like 15 minutes just
to<00:00:49.829> kind<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.100> sit<00:00:50.370> in<00:00:50.489> some<00:00:50.730> curl<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:52.170> these

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
to kind of sit in some curl and so these

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.840 
to kind of sit in some curl and so these
are<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.620> resulting<00:00:53.190> curls<00:00:53.489> they're<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.670> little

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
are the resulting curls they're a little

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.889 
are the resulting curls they're a little
crazy<00:00:54.180> i'm<00:00:54.480> still<00:00:54.750> working<00:00:55.500> with<00:00:55.860> them<00:00:55.980> but<00:00:56.899> i

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
crazy i'm still working with them but i

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.630 
crazy i'm still working with them but i
kind<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.739> like<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.449> overall<00:01:00.449> effect<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.859> yeah

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
kind of like the overall effect so yeah

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.039 
kind of like the overall effect so yeah
i'll<00:01:02.850> probably<00:01:03.090> end<00:01:03.210> up<00:01:03.390> smoothing<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.899> few

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
i'll probably end up smoothing a few

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.359 
i'll probably end up smoothing a few
more<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.260> these<00:01:04.350> out<00:01:04.619> there<00:01:04.860> kind<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.189> just

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
more of these out there kind of just

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.820 
more of these out there kind of just
loose<00:01:05.610> wavy<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.240> i<00:01:06.750> guess<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.200> kind<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.530> crazy

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
loose wavy and i guess it kind of crazy

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.000 
loose wavy and i guess it kind of crazy
but<00:01:08.490> i<00:01:08.549> like<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:09.140> on<00:01:10.140> my<00:01:10.320> eyes<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.740> probably

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
but i like it on my eyes you probably

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.880 
but i like it on my eyes you probably
can't<00:01:11.340> tell<00:01:11.430> but<00:01:11.580> i<00:01:11.729> have<00:01:11.939> this<00:01:12.119> kind<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.890> if

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
can't tell but i have this kind of if

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.260 
can't tell but i have this kind of if
the<00:01:14.040> heart<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.430> explain<00:01:14.820> it's<00:01:14.970> one<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.180> those

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
the heart to explain it's one of those

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.929 
the heart to explain it's one of those
those<00:01:16.140> pigments<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.860> kind<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.280> morphs<00:01:17.759> and

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
those pigments that kind of morphs and

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.999 
those pigments that kind of morphs and
changes<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.659> sort<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:18.960> looks<00:01:19.140> brown<00:01:19.500> at

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
changes so it sort of looks brown at

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.530 
changes so it sort of looks brown at
certain<00:01:20.610> angles<00:01:20.759> but<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.180> sort<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.360> looks

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
certain angles but it sort of looks

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.880 
certain angles but it sort of looks
green<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:22.049> probably<00:01:22.320> won't<00:01:22.470> be<00:01:22.560> able<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.770> till

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
green you probably won't be able to till

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.420 
green you probably won't be able to till
it<00:01:23.040> outside<00:01:23.460> here<00:01:23.880> though<00:01:24.060> because<00:01:25.310> you<00:01:26.310> know

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
it outside here though because you know

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.010 
it outside here though because you know
it's<00:01:26.549> probably<00:01:26.790> not<00:01:26.970> picking<00:01:27.630> up<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.840> color

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
it's probably not picking up the color

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.280 
it's probably not picking up the color
as<00:01:28.259> well<00:01:29.119> and<00:01:30.119> then<00:01:30.509> i<00:01:30.600> have<00:01:30.630> one<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.930> little<00:01:31.200> bit

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
as well and then i have one a little bit

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.380 
as well and then i have one a little bit
of<00:01:31.380> blush<00:01:31.759> nothing<00:01:32.759> on<00:01:32.850> my<00:01:32.939> lips<00:01:33.150> right<00:01:33.329> now

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
of blush nothing on my lips right now

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.609 
of blush nothing on my lips right now
i'm<00:01:33.600> still<00:01:33.750> trying<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.049> decide<00:01:34.170> if<00:01:34.380> i'm

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
i'm still trying to decide if i'm

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.109 
i'm still trying to decide if i'm
probably<00:01:34.829> going<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.189> do<00:01:35.310> like<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.490> clear<00:01:35.880> gloss

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
probably going to do like a clear gloss

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.530 
probably going to do like a clear gloss
and<00:01:36.570> then<00:01:37.439> in<00:01:37.590> my<00:01:37.770> ears<00:01:38.130> if<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:39.000> saw<00:01:39.240> my
