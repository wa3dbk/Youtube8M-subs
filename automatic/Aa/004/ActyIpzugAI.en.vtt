00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 this topic is chilling because the 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.509
 man has come very far in his 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.040
 genetic experiments unfortunately 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.380
 the results have always been 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.110
 horrendous human short- lived animals 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.269
 deficient and awkward deformities is what 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.400
 only they have always obtained and that is what 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.109
 only that they will always get then only 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.660
 are manipulating and altering the 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.449
 perfect creation of god all the 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.789
 creation is perfect the scientists are 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.310
 they look like 5 year old children who have 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.410
 a lot of toys are disarmed by all 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.620
 and they put together one of the whole bunch of 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.320
 pieces what is the result a monster 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.329
 toy monsters hybrid human 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.910
 animal are being created by 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.550
 scientists from all over the planet according to 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.469
 them for the good of humanity in 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.170
 other experiments have been injected 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.870
 human stem cells in mice has been 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.640
 introduced the human DNA into rabbits it 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.649
 they have created pigs that they carry in their 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.190
 veins human blood and lambs with 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.289
 livers and heart largely human 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.750
 according to rifkin some scientists have 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.150
 proposed to even create a breakthrough 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.750
 English human and chimpanzee that would be the 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.880
 Guinea Pig 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.720
 for research laboratories 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.550
 the chimpanzee shares with us the 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.710
 98% of the human genome and one copy 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.590
 adult has the mental level of a child 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.780
 of 4 years the first experience of 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.210
 genetic creation took place some 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.190
 years in Edinburgh Scotland when the 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.229
 scientists mixed an embryo of 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.300
 lamb with one goat two species 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.180
 animals without any relationship to each other 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.550
 and that are unable to fit the 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.310
 result a creature that had head 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.780
 of goat and lamb body try 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.759
 that lies behind these 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.259
 investigations is to cross our 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.210
 species with animals to get 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.009
 hybrids of all kinds that 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.920
 would represent the panacea of 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.170
 medical research scientists 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.240
 consider that the more a 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.250
 animal to an easier human will be 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.860
 simulate in your flesh the progression of 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.050
 human diseases experience new 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.880
 medicines and collect tissues from 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.789
 organs that can be implanted in 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.590
 people this idea also implies the 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.720
 creation through manipulations 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.310
 genetic of animal organs that then 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.430
 can be transplanted in their 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.010
 integrity to sick people 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.689
 this sounds good but it seems to me only one 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.879
 justification by the 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:23.090
 crazy scientists to continue with their 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:25.519
 horrendous experiments good people les 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.829
 Hello, I figured, subscribe, be this 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.829
 it's my new channel until next time
