probably<00:01:34.680> not<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.130> best<00:01:35.159> idea<00:01:35.579> as<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.750> can

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
probably not the best idea as you can

tell he destroyed my motor tower up

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.600 
tell he destroyed my motor tower up
there<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.750> wouldn't<00:01:40.140> kill<00:01:40.530> his<00:01:40.950> barbarians

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
there so it wouldn't kill his barbarians

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.080 
there so it wouldn't kill his barbarians
which<00:01:42.150> was<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.360> smart<00:01:42.689> move<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.909> he's<00:01:44.909> using

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
which was a smart move and he's using

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.819 
which was a smart move and he's using
those<00:01:45.270> level<00:01:45.720> five<00:01:45.930> wizards<00:01:46.259> which<00:01:46.649> are

those level five wizards which are

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.999 
those level five wizards which are
pretty<00:01:47.100> powerful<00:01:47.579> actually<00:01:48.890> wrecking<00:01:49.890> my

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
pretty powerful actually wrecking my

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.980 
pretty powerful actually wrecking my
base<00:01:50.189> right<00:01:50.399> now<00:01:50.460> but<00:01:51.090> once<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.540> mortar

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
base right now but once that mortar

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.319 
base right now but once that mortar
comes<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.500> destroys<00:01:52.649> all<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.159> archers<00:01:53.850> he

really<00:01:54.479> doesn't<00:01:54.720> have<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.960> chance<00:01:56.719> he<00:01:57.719> would

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
really doesn't have a chance he would

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.200 
really doesn't have a chance he would
have<00:01:57.930> done<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.079> lot<00:01:58.350> better<00:01:58.409> if<00:01:58.969> he<00:01:59.969> would<00:02:00.090> have

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
have done a lot better if he would have

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.319

almost a hundred thousand gold no elixir
so<00:04:02.910> I<00:04:03.239> guess<00:04:03.810> and<00:04:03.959> he<00:04:04.050> attacked<00:04:04.440> from<00:04:04.770> the<00:04:04.860> top

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
so I guess and he attacked from the top

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.640 
so I guess and he attacked from the top
as<00:04:05.370> well<00:04:05.610> because<00:04:06.480> I<00:04:06.660> got<00:04:06.840> a<00:04:06.870> bunch<00:04:07.200> of<00:04:07.320> pumps

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
as well because I got a bunch of pumps

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.750 
as well because I got a bunch of pumps
over<00:04:07.860> here<00:04:08.040> I'll<00:04:08.760> be<00:04:08.820> taught<00:04:09.120> from<00:04:09.510> the<00:04:09.570> side

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
over here I'll be taught from the side

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.920 
over here I'll be taught from the side
alright<00:04:11.760> yeah<00:04:11.940> that<00:04:12.120> that<00:04:12.360> probably<00:04:12.600> wasn't

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
alright yeah that that probably wasn't

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.930 
alright yeah that that probably wasn't
the<00:04:13.110> best<00:04:13.170> strategy<00:04:14.160> to<00:04:14.190> attack<00:04:14.700> from<00:04:14.880> the

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
the best strategy to attack from the

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.479 
the best strategy to attack from the
side<00:04:15.500> that's<00:04:16.500> actually<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:16.950> first<00:04:17.070> time<00:04:17.250> I've

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489
