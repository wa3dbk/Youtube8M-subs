00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
hi this is a quick tutorial how you can

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.690 
hi this is a quick tutorial how you can
embed<00:00:03.179> a<00:00:03.950> 99<00:00:04.950> polls<00:00:05.279> online<00:00:06.060> poll<00:00:07.519> in<00:00:08.519> a

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
embed a 99 polls online poll in a

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.669 
embed a 99 polls online poll in a
PowerPoint<00:00:09.000> presentation<00:00:09.450> I<00:00:10.349> think<00:00:10.559> there

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
PowerPoint presentation I think there

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.350 
PowerPoint presentation I think there
are<00:00:10.710> two<00:00:10.860> user<00:00:11.130> cases<00:00:11.580> for<00:00:11.759> this<00:00:11.849> one<00:00:12.120> way<00:00:12.300> you

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
are two user cases for this one way you

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.509 
are two user cases for this one way you
give<00:00:13.049> people<00:00:13.259> this<00:00:13.469> link<00:00:13.740> allowing<00:00:14.160> people<00:00:14.370> to

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
give people this link allowing people to

result in a PowerPoint slide or
alternatively<00:00:19.160> embedding<00:00:20.160> this<00:00:20.250> in<00:00:20.400> a

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
alternatively embedding this in a

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.980 
alternatively embedding this in a
PowerPoint<00:00:20.730> sending<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.689> loads<00:00:21.900> of

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
what you need to do is where I've

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.810 
what you need to do is where I've
denoted<00:01:34.970> this<00:01:36.049> 5<00:01:37.049> crosses<00:01:37.920> here<00:01:38.250> we<00:01:38.610> need<00:01:38.759> to

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
denoted this 5 crosses here we need to

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.530 
denoted this 5 crosses here we need to
put<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.240> code<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.930> online<00:01:40.320> polls<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:41.540> in

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
put the code of the online polls so in

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.899 
put the code of the online polls so in
here<00:01:42.750> you'll<00:01:42.960> find<00:01:43.229> there's<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.470> unique<00:01:43.909> five

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
here you'll find there's a unique five

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.380 
here you'll find there's a unique five
digit<00:01:45.329> code<00:01:45.360> so<00:01:45.810> we<00:01:45.899> just<00:01:46.079> need<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.350> copy<00:01:46.530> that

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
digit code so we just need to copy that

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.590 
digit code so we just need to copy that
copy<00:01:48.950> go<00:01:49.950> back<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.220> my<00:01:50.310> powerpoint<00:01:50.520> slide<00:01:51.030> and

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
copy go back to my powerpoint slide and

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.969 
copy go back to my powerpoint slide and
just<00:01:52.310> embed<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:55.189> here<00:01:56.600> so<00:01:57.600> now<00:01:57.869> if<00:01:58.500> we<00:01:58.560> close

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
just embed that here so now if we close

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.389 
just embed that here so now if we close
that<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.670> go<00:01:59.880> to<00:01:59.909> present<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:01.250> there's<00:02:02.250> my

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
that and go to present it there's my

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.030 
that and go to present it there's my
hole<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.719> can<00:02:03.869> then<00:02:03.960> do<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.649> in<00:02:04.740> real<00:02:04.979> time

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
hole so you can then do it in real time

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.219 
hole so you can then do it in real time
and<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:06.149> can<00:02:06.570> see<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:06.930> result

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
and you can see that result

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.529 
and you can see that result
anyway<00:02:09.039> I<00:02:09.190> will<00:02:09.520> make<00:02:10.000> all<00:02:10.179> this<00:02:10.270> available

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
anyway I will make all this available
