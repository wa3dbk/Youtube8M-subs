feet<00:00:41.370> before<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.449> connectivity<00:00:43.079> starts<00:00:43.440> to

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
feet before the connectivity starts to

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.819 
feet before the connectivity starts to
diminish<00:00:43.739> on<00:00:44.610> these<00:00:45.270> headphones<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:46.050> for<00:00:46.770> the

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
diminish on these headphones so for the

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.740

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
people having that issue I'd say maybe

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.360 
people having that issue I'd say maybe
send<00:00:49.079> them<00:00:49.199> back<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.590> possibly<00:00:50.100> could<00:00:50.309> be

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
send them back that possibly could be

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.569 
send them back that possibly could be
covered<00:00:50.940> under<00:00:51.180> warranty<00:00:52.219> so<00:00:53.219> let's<00:00:53.399> take<00:00:53.550> a

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
covered under warranty so let's take a

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.900 
covered under warranty so let's take a
look<00:00:53.850> here<00:00:54.120> at<00:00:55.109> the<00:00:55.260> design<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:56.609> yeah<00:00:56.730> of

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
look here at the design so yeah of

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.689 
look here at the design so yeah of
