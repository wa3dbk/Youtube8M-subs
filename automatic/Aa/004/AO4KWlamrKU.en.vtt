00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.299
 so hello and welcome to darling 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.550
 section with world of dover like her 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.650
 See there will be the first in items 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.140
 So as soon as the patch is online 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.970
 times everything scales down as this is the 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.129
 total numbers were so high that it 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.469
 no longer clear was decided 

00:00:26.129 --> 00:00:30.450
 blizzard finally to the items too 

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:33.000
 solubilizing against stands bruised and 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.440
 Here you will see again for a 528th 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.739
 Air weapon will look like you see 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.000
 there are 200 ps all values â€‹â€‹are far away 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.680
 dropped down 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.570
 so that all over again 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.760
 Being clear becomes a small example 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.910
 in the tank has with the extension on 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.220
 level 90 38,000 abi and not over 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.890
 a million directly to the darling of 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.500
 lemming transmissions give that means 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.480
 just as much as during the level 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.989
 so that everything goes faster and fun 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.000
 how come the little bonus with it 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.670
 her just more of the match did that 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.700
 entire simply faster from then goes 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.979
 and generally more fun makes one 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.600
 it will also be another major change 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.299
 the accounts the inventory system 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.100
 character models give you that 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.100
 systems are cleaned up a bit 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.689
 there as well as heirlooms and so on 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.439
 So the account bound item 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.539
 Everyone slides into the menu and is not 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.310
 more in your pockets, which of course one 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:30.929
 Great relief is above all else 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.759
 so if you have it over several 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:35.340
 Characters have not distributed anymore 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.740
 know where the damn thing was now and what 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.450
 wanted to play and drink the whole 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.609
 it does not work that is natural 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.439
 always very very annoying another very 

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:46.109
 Good news is the blow on level 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.149
 90 that you can have a character directly 

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:50.939
 blow on level 90 and so on 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.039
 but play more directly in ours 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.020
 Describing slink that's exactly 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.539
 explains how that will work 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.009
 and now after 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:01.799
 Last but not least, the level 100 talents 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.029
 every class gets new talents at the end 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.029
 and of course we have them too 

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:07.950
 our talents are listed 

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:09.810
 a lot of news can be found in 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.800
 rest by asking questions 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.800
