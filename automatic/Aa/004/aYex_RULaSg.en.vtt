figures<00:01:54.330> when<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.570> first<00:01:54.750> get<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.049> has<00:01:55.229> Ops

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
figures when you first get the has Ops

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.990 
figures when you first get the has Ops
is<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:56.010> you<00:01:56.159> can<00:01:56.280> see<00:01:56.430> here<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.700> looks<00:01:56.850> like

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
is that you can see here it looks like

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.550 
is that you can see here it looks like
some<00:01:57.150> of<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.299> paint's<00:01:57.570> been<00:01:57.600> removed<00:01:58.020> that's

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
some of the paint's been removed that's

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.810 
some of the paint's been removed that's
because<00:01:58.890> it's<00:01:59.070> still<00:01:59.130> attached<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.640> this

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
because it's still attached to this

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.480 
because it's still attached to this
little<00:02:00.060> doohickey<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:01.320> yeah<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.130> actually

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
little doohickey so yeah it actually

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.179 
little doohickey so yeah it actually
can't<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:03.510> removable<00:02:04.140> but<00:02:04.920> when<00:02:05.100> you

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
can't it is removable but when you

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.219 
can't it is removable but when you
initially<00:02:05.580> get<00:02:05.760> it<00:02:05.939> it's<00:02:06.390> kind<00:02:06.689> of<00:02:06.780> like<00:02:06.930> the

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
initially get it it's kind of like the

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.449 
initially get it it's kind of like the
paint's<00:02:07.560> gonna<00:02:07.680> come<00:02:07.860> off<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:07.979> little<00:02:08.189> bit<00:02:08.399> so

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.760 
pennies tall overall I think this figure
is<00:05:15.150> really<00:05:15.570> really<00:05:16.020> incredible<00:05:16.440> I<00:05:16.560> would<00:05:16.680> give

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
is really really incredible I would give

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.200 
is really really incredible I would give
him<00:05:16.830> a<00:05:16.919> 5<00:05:17.070> out<00:05:17.250> of<00:05:17.280> 5<00:05:17.370> he<00:05:17.610> has<00:05:17.639> all<00:05:17.850> the<00:05:18.000> best

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
him a 5 out of 5 he has all the best

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.510 
him a 5 out of 5 he has all the best
stuff<00:05:18.479> of<00:05:18.690> all<00:05:18.810> the<00:05:18.900> other<00:05:19.020> Spartans<00:05:19.500> you<00:05:20.430> know

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
stuff of all the other Spartans you know

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.740 
stuff of all the other Spartans you know
that<00:05:20.669> our<00:05:20.760> standard<00:05:21.060> Spartans<00:05:21.389> he<00:05:21.479> comes<00:05:21.660> with

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
that our standard Spartans he comes with

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.920 
that our standard Spartans he comes with
the<00:05:21.840> DMR<00:05:22.200> the<00:05:22.650> only<00:05:23.010> downside<00:05:23.669> to<00:05:23.940> this<00:05:24.120> DMR<00:05:24.690> is

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
the DMR the only downside to this DMR is

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.050 
the DMR the only downside to this DMR is
that<00:05:25.169> it<00:05:25.290> doesn't<00:05:25.590> exactly<00:05:26.130> fit<00:05:26.580> into<00:05:26.790> their

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
that it doesn't exactly fit into their

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.180 
that it doesn't exactly fit into their
hands<00:05:27.330> I<00:05:27.450> know<00:05:27.630> it's<00:05:27.840> one<00:05:28.020> more<00:05:28.200> weapon<00:05:28.410> that

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
hands I know it's one more weapon that

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.250 
hands I know it's one more weapon that
the<00:05:29.580> figures<00:05:30.030> can't<00:05:30.330> you<00:05:30.720> know<00:05:30.840> really<00:05:31.050> hold

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
the figures can't you know really hold

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.900 
the figures can't you know really hold
their<00:05:31.440> weapons<00:05:31.800> he<00:05:32.310> can<00:05:32.460> hold<00:05:32.639> the<00:05:32.760> weapon

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
their weapons he can hold the weapon

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:33.830 
their weapons he can hold the weapon
obviously<00:05:33.330> and<00:05:33.419> it's<00:05:33.510> not<00:05:33.600> going<00:05:33.720> to<00:05:33.780> just

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
obviously and it's not going to just

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.379 
obviously and it's not going to just
shake<00:05:34.080> out<00:05:34.200> of<00:05:34.320> his<00:05:34.410> hands<00:05:34.590> but<00:05:35.280> when<00:05:36.090> you<00:05:36.180> look

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:36.389 
shake out of his hands but when you look

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:38.300 
shake out of his hands but when you look
at<00:05:36.539> it<00:05:36.780> you<00:05:36.930> can<00:05:37.080> see<00:05:37.320> he's<00:05:37.530> not<00:05:37.710> exactly

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
at it you can see he's not exactly

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.090 
at it you can see he's not exactly
holding<00:05:39.000> it<00:05:39.330> it's<00:05:39.479> kind<00:05:39.660> of<00:05:39.720> just<00:05:39.930> like<00:05:40.080> I<00:05:40.410> kind

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
holding it it's kind of just like I kind

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.219 
holding it it's kind of just like I kind
of<00:05:41.160> got<00:05:41.310> it<00:05:41.460> so<00:05:42.060> if<00:05:42.210> somebody's<00:05:42.630> life<00:05:42.990> was<00:05:43.200> on

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
of got it so if somebody's life was on

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:44.270 
of got it so if somebody's life was on
the<00:05:43.350> line<00:05:43.410> because<00:05:43.740> they<00:05:43.830> were<00:05:43.889> holding<00:05:44.039> on<00:05:44.190> to

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
the line because they were holding on to

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.620 
the line because they were holding on to
the<00:05:44.370> gun<00:05:44.520> he's<00:05:44.700> trying<00:05:44.850> to<00:05:44.940> pull<00:05:45.090> them<00:05:45.240> up<00:05:45.389> they

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
the gun he's trying to pull them up they

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.210 
the gun he's trying to pull them up they
would<00:05:45.780> die<00:05:45.960> because<00:05:46.289> he<00:05:46.470> would<00:05:46.590> drop<00:05:46.740> the<00:05:46.889> gun

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
would die because he would drop the gun

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.719 
would die because he would drop the gun
the<00:05:47.990> the<00:05:48.990> trigger<00:05:49.260> I<00:05:49.560> mean<00:05:49.860> you<00:05:50.010> really<00:05:50.190> need<00:05:50.460> a

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
the the trigger I mean you really need a

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:52.610 
the the trigger I mean you really need a
figure<00:05:51.419> where<00:05:51.750> the<00:05:51.810> trigger<00:05:51.960> finger<00:05:52.169> really

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
figure where the trigger finger really

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.339 
figure where the trigger finger really
you<00:05:52.979> do<00:05:53.100> okay<00:05:53.550> and<00:05:54.360> this<00:05:54.570> gun<00:05:54.750> since<00:05:55.080> it<00:05:55.200> has

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:55.349 
you do okay and this gun since it has

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:56.659 
you do okay and this gun since it has
this<00:05:55.530> little<00:05:55.680> thing<00:05:56.070> right<00:05:56.160> here<00:05:56.220> that<00:05:56.580> you

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:56.669 
this little thing right here that you

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:59.779 
this little thing right here that you
can<00:05:56.729> easily<00:05:56.970> just<00:05:57.300> clap<00:05:57.710> cut<00:05:58.710> off<00:05:58.919> you<00:05:59.639> could

00:05:59.779 --> 00:05:59.789 
can easily just clap cut off you could

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:01.279 
can easily just clap cut off you could
easily<00:05:59.940> get<00:06:00.210> it<00:06:00.330> so<00:06:00.479> it<00:06:00.599> fits<00:06:00.780> better<00:06:01.050> into

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:01.289 
easily get it so it fits better into

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:02.450 
easily get it so it fits better into
their<00:06:01.470> hands<00:06:01.650> but<00:06:01.919> I<00:06:01.950> didn't<00:06:02.130> really<00:06:02.280> want<00:06:02.430> to

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
their hands but I didn't really want to

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.680 
their hands but I didn't really want to
do<00:06:02.610> that<00:06:02.639> for<00:06:02.910> this<00:06:03.060> review<00:06:03.330> so<00:06:03.479> I<00:06:03.510> want<00:06:03.660> to

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
do that for this review so I want to

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.460 
do that for this review so I want to
show<00:06:03.870> you<00:06:03.960> what<00:06:04.169> it<00:06:04.229> looks<00:06:04.380> like<00:06:04.500> normally<00:06:05.310> now

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:06.470 
show you what it looks like normally now

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.020 
show you what it looks like normally now
let's<00:06:07.470> see<00:06:07.889> if<00:06:08.070> you<00:06:08.220> give<00:06:08.400> him<00:06:08.460> a<00:06:08.550> battle<00:06:08.849> rifle

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
let's see if you give him a battle rifle

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.210 
let's see if you give him a battle rifle
he<00:06:10.020> can't<00:06:10.289> exactly<00:06:10.620> hold<00:06:10.889> that<00:06:11.099> either

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 
he can't exactly hold that either

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:12.740 
he can't exactly hold that either
because<00:06:11.430> his<00:06:11.550> hand<00:06:11.729> isn't<00:06:12.000> tight<00:06:12.210> enough<00:06:12.450> so

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
because his hand isn't tight enough so

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.529 
because his hand isn't tight enough so
that<00:06:13.710> is<00:06:13.830> a<00:06:13.860> problem<00:06:14.280> in<00:06:14.610> that<00:06:14.700> you<00:06:15.419> know<00:06:15.510> you

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:15.539 
that is a problem in that you know you

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:18.740 
that is a problem in that you know you
can't<00:06:15.930> really<00:06:16.139> get<00:06:16.889> him<00:06:17.039> hold<00:06:17.550> I<00:06:17.820> mean<00:06:18.479> you<00:06:18.599> can

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
can't really get him hold I mean you can

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.100 
can't really get him hold I mean you can
get<00:06:18.840> him<00:06:18.960> to<00:06:18.990> hold<00:06:19.169> other<00:06:19.740> guns<00:06:20.690> see<00:06:21.690> you<00:06:21.990> get

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.110 
get him to hold other guns see you get

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.159 
get him to hold other guns see you get
him<00:06:22.200> to<00:06:22.260> hold<00:06:22.320> the<00:06:22.440> battle<00:06:22.620> rifle<00:06:23.930> he<00:06:24.930> thinks

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169 
him to hold the battle rifle he thinks

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:28.760
