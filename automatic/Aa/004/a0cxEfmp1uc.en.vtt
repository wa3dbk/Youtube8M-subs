00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.519 

hey<00:00:01.890> everyone<00:00:02.600> before<00:00:03.600> we<00:00:03.689> get<00:00:03.840> into<00:00:04.049> decoding

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
hey everyone before we get into decoding

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:05.720 
hey everyone before we get into decoding
actually<00:00:05.009> want<00:00:05.160> to<00:00:05.190> talk<00:00:05.310> a<00:00:05.370> little<00:00:05.640> more

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
actually want to talk a little more

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.639 
actually want to talk a little more
about<00:00:05.879> picking<00:00:06.450> because<00:00:06.990> I<00:00:07.049> realize<00:00:07.290> I<00:00:07.440> told

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
about picking because I realize I told

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.709 
about picking because I realize I told
you<00:00:07.770> about<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:08.610> mechanical<00:00:09.090> use<00:00:09.269> of<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.540> tool

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
you about the mechanical use of the tool

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.620 
you about the mechanical use of the tool
but<00:00:10.050> not<00:00:10.110> what<00:00:10.380> it<00:00:10.469> actually<00:00:10.620> feels<00:00:11.070> like<00:00:11.630> one

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
but not what it actually feels like one

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.150 
but not what it actually feels like one
of<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.809> nice<00:00:12.960> things<00:00:12.990> coming<00:00:13.620> from<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.920> pin

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
of the nice things coming from a pin

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.070 
of the nice things coming from a pin
tumbler<00:00:14.309> picking<00:00:14.759> background<00:00:15.210> is<00:00:15.450> that<00:00:15.509> when

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
tumbler picking background is that when

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.590 
tumbler picking background is that when
the<00:00:16.230> sidebar<00:00:16.500> sets<00:00:17.039> on<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.250> gate<00:00:17.520> it's<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.300> much

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
the sidebar sets on a gate it's a much

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.570 
the sidebar sets on a gate it's a much
more<00:00:18.810> distinct<00:00:19.289> feeling<00:00:19.500> than<00:00:20.070> one<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:20.340> pins

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
more distinct feeling than one of pins

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.609 
more distinct feeling than one of pins
that's<00:00:20.850> on<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.090> shear<00:00:21.300> line<00:00:21.619> however

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
that's on the shear line however

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.070 
that's on the shear line however
particularly<00:00:23.550> these<00:00:23.820> Abbas's<00:00:24.480> there<00:00:24.930> are

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
particularly these Abbas's there are

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.150 
particularly these Abbas's there are
some<00:00:25.260> false<00:00:25.529> gates<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:26.010> worry<00:00:26.160> about<00:00:27.080> so<00:00:28.160> when

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
some false gates to worry about so when

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.460 
some false gates to worry about so when
you're<00:00:29.310> picking<00:00:29.460> through<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.880> lock<00:00:30.470> there

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
you're picking through the lock there

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.690 
you're picking through the lock there
will<00:00:31.560> be<00:00:31.590> false<00:00:31.949> gates<00:00:32.219> on<00:00:32.430> each<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.940> desks

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
will be false gates on each of the desks

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.280 
will be false gates on each of the desks
but<00:00:35.700> what<00:00:35.940> those<00:00:36.120> false<00:00:36.420> gates<00:00:36.719> feel<00:00:37.020> like

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
but what those false gates feel like

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.340 
but what those false gates feel like
compared<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.100> true<00:00:38.340> gate<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:39.350> just

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
compared to the true gate is just

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.260 
compared to the true gate is just
different<00:00:40.649> enough<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.700> might<00:00:41.940> be<00:00:42.120> able

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
different enough that you might be able

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.440 
different enough that you might be able
to<00:00:42.390> differentiate<00:00:42.930> between<00:00:43.050> them<00:00:43.670> now<00:00:44.670> the

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
to differentiate between them now the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.970 
to differentiate between them now the
decoding<00:00:45.899> part<00:00:46.110> which<00:00:46.320> we'll<00:00:46.469> talk<00:00:46.590> about<00:00:46.649> in

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
decoding part which we'll talk about in

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.950 
decoding part which we'll talk about in
a<00:00:47.070> second<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.910> what's<00:00:48.120> going<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.360> save<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.809> and

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
a second is what's going to save you and

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.260 
a second is what's going to save you and
you<00:00:49.050> can't<00:00:49.320> differentiate<00:00:49.739> between<00:00:50.010> them<00:00:50.460> but

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
you can't differentiate between them but

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.229 
you can't differentiate between them but
for<00:00:51.449> now<00:00:51.770> let's<00:00:52.770> have<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:52.980> look<00:00:53.280> at<00:00:53.489> what<00:00:54.210> a

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
for now let's have a look at what a

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.439 
for now let's have a look at what a
single<00:00:54.809> disk<00:00:55.440> looks<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.550> feels<00:00:56.820> like<00:00:57.000> when

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
single disk looks and feels like when

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.660 
single disk looks and feels like when
you're<00:00:57.570> trapped<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.109> false<00:00:58.350> key<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.859> when

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
you're trapped in a false key and when

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.450 
you're trapped in a false key and when
you<00:00:59.760> find<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.120> true<00:01:00.329> gate<00:01:01.039> so<00:01:02.039> when<00:01:02.340> you're

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
you find the true gate so when you're

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.969 
you find the true gate so when you're
manipulating<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.149> disk<00:01:03.359> that's<00:01:03.539> binding

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
manipulating a disk that's binding

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.859 
manipulating a disk that's binding
you'll<00:01:04.979> feel<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.670> grinding<00:01:06.180> against<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.630> side

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
you'll feel it grinding against the side

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.899 
you'll feel it grinding against the side
bar<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.500> then<00:01:07.860> when<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.340> reach<00:01:08.549> either<00:01:08.760> a

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
bar and then when you reach either a

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.039 
bar and then when you reach either a
true<00:01:09.240> or<00:01:09.479> false<00:01:09.720> gate<00:01:10.250> suddenly<00:01:11.250> go<00:01:11.490> free

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
true or false gate suddenly go free

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.359 
true or false gate suddenly go free
it'll<00:01:13.049> loosen<00:01:13.229> up<00:01:13.560> you'll<00:01:13.950> have<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.130> little

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
it'll loosen up you'll have a little

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.940 
it'll loosen up you'll have a little
freedom<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.820> movement<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.680> what<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.799> need<00:01:16.890> to

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
freedom of movement and what you need to

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.980 
freedom of movement and what you need to
do<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.700> figure<00:01:17.909> out<00:01:18.030> exactly<00:01:18.509> how<00:01:18.750> much

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
do is figure out exactly how much

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.520 
do is figure out exactly how much
freedom<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.470> movement<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.950> have<00:01:21.409> so<00:01:22.409> we're

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
freedom of movement you have so we're

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.249 
freedom of movement you have so we're
going<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.680> test<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.549> first<00:01:23.729> one<00:01:24.000> here<00:01:24.259> after

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
going to test the first one here after

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.510 
going to test the first one here after
you've<00:01:25.380> tested<00:01:25.590> how<00:01:25.860> much<00:01:26.009> wiggle<00:01:26.220> room<00:01:26.400> you

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
you've tested how much wiggle room you

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.149 
you've tested how much wiggle room you
have<00:01:26.820> moving<00:01:27.509> into<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.990> next<00:01:28.259> gate<00:01:28.530> will

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
have moving into the next gate will

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.010 
have moving into the next gate will
require<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.850> loosen<00:01:30.390> your<00:01:30.479> tension<00:01:30.930> a

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
require you to loosen your tension a

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.109 
require you to loosen your tension a
little<00:01:31.259> bit<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.310> just<00:01:32.490> lighten<00:01:32.850> up<00:01:32.909> and

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
little bit so you just lighten up and

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.980 
little bit so you just lighten up and
then<00:01:33.320> drop<00:01:34.320> into<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.920> next<00:01:35.189> gate<00:01:35.930> now<00:01:36.930> the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
then drop into the next gate now the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.510 
then drop into the next gate now the
false<00:01:37.350> gates<00:01:37.560> we<00:01:37.740> had<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.920> little<00:01:38.100> room<00:01:38.310> but

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
false gates we had a little room but

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.940 
false gates we had a little room but
here<00:01:38.970> in<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.299> true<00:01:39.540> gate<00:01:39.780> we<00:01:40.530> have<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.680> lot<00:01:40.920> of

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
here in the true gate we have a lot of

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.789 
here in the true gate we have a lot of
room<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.220> move<00:01:41.750> the<00:01:42.750> act<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.259> practical

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
room to move the act the practical

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.340 
room to move the act the practical
difference<00:01:44.100> isn't<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.520> much<00:01:44.729> but<00:01:45.350> compared

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
difference isn't that much but compared

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.649 
difference isn't that much but compared
to<00:01:46.439> one<00:01:46.680> another<00:01:46.950> it's<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.490> it's<00:01:48.000> significant

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
to one another it's a it's significant

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.899 
to one another it's a it's significant
so<00:01:49.170> working<00:01:49.380> in<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.649> true<00:01:49.860> gate<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.460> really<00:01:50.700> do

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
so working in a true gate you really do

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.850 
so working in a true gate you really do
have<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.149> good<00:01:51.509> amount<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.869> movement<00:01:52.200> compared

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
have a good amount of movement compared

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.100 
have a good amount of movement compared
to<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.100> false<00:01:53.340> gates<00:01:53.640> but<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.540> can<00:01:54.659> be<00:01:54.750> really

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
to the false gates but it can be really

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.870 
to the false gates but it can be really
difficult<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.649> tell<00:01:55.979> you're<00:01:56.340> working<00:01:56.700> blind

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
difficult to tell you're working blind

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.350 
difficult to tell you're working blind
inside<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.509> lock<00:01:58.399> so<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.640> markings<00:02:00.149> on

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
inside of the lock so the markings on

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.870 
inside of the lock so the markings on
geckoes<00:02:00.719> tool<00:02:01.079> can<00:02:01.649> give<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:01.979> big<00:02:02.399> leg<00:02:02.670> up
