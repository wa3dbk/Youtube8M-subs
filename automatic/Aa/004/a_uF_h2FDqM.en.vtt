00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.820
My name is Luis, I'm from Alicante

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.980
I'm a military man and I'm 30 years old.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.140
My alopecia started when I was 23,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.980
and in truth it really worried me

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.020
I visited dermatologists in hospitals

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.360
and they told me to try Minoxidil and Finasteride

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.240
which were two scientifically proven products

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.780
and said I should notice an improvement.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.740
I only really saw an improvement for two, three years

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.060
and after that my alopecia started to become worse.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.880
I went into forums, looked at different companies

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.200
working with hair and the one that gave me

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.060
the most confidence was Aldemar Campos.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.260
I chose Aldemar Campos because I saw him as a transparent person,

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.900
I saw a person who is friendly,

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.840
that he has also suffered what I am suffering now and

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.740
has had this treatment.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.880
There are other companies with grafts and implants,

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.580
but the doctor performing them doesn't have one.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
You can visit the dermatologist and there are some

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.100
dermatologists who are bald, who haven't done any of

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.400
the procedures they prescribe for you.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.880
So this is one of the things

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:20.920
that has really given me confidence.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.200
I saw the models he has on the website and in truth,

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.340
compared to other websites, they gave me even more confidence,

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.580
and I don't need to tell you the impact of seeing them in person.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.060
I met three guys who had done it and it was truly impressive to see them in person.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.140
I thought that you would be able to see the points,

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.860
it would be noticeable.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.160
But you approach them

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.200
and touch the front part of their head,

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.380
and in truth it is impressively realistic.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.720
My treatment lasted three sessions.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.840
In terms of deciding on the hairline,

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.900
I wanted a type of hairline,

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.320
Aldemar was advising me on this,

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.280
but in the first session

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.540
you don't really define what this hairline is going to be,

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.160
he just gives you ideas.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.600
Are you going to have the broken, semi-broken

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.780
or defined front hairline

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.200
In the second treatment,

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.840
this is where the hairline is defined a little more,

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.840
the hairline you are going to have,

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.360
and in the third it is all about adding a little definition,

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.260
the finer points and making it look as realistic as possible.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.060
I always have a saying,

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.480
that you get what you pay for, right?

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.360
In other words, before contacting Aldemar I was looking at different options.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:35.660
To me it smelled a little fishy, the fact that some companies were very cheap.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.220
I had already been in touch with Aldemar,

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.540
so I got in touch with him and mentioned the prices

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.260
that other companies had sent me.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.460
At no point did he criticise those companies,

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.300
he just told me to look on the Internet, observe,

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.020
ask questions and inform myself, this is important.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
Which tells you something,

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.880
not telling you who to go with,

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.700
not just saying to come to me.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.600
What I want to say is that Aldemar is at no point...

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.600
he does not do the hard sell,

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.600
he just gives you information,

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.280
you can call him at all hours and he'll pick up the phone,

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.320
you can send him a Whatsapp,

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.560
he always seeks perfection

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.800
and he always told me

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.080
that if I had to have any retouching done,

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.300
that if I needed anything done he would do it for me.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.720
The fact that you have a big company

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.460
does not mean that the treatment

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:27.860
you are going to get will be good.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.740
The fact that it is a small business

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.080
might put some people off,

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.320
but what was very,

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.760
very important to me is that he treated me.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.780
I can go to a big company, speak with the doctor,

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.040
but in the end they won't carry out the treatment,

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.900
it will be done by a nurse or another doctor.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.700
One of the differences, in terms of finance,

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.700
in terms of money,

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.000
is that Aldemar told me at all times that the price was X,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.980
but another good thing is that talking

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.980
to him you gain trust,

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.480
and the issue of the payment,

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.260
that is something that you can agree with him

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.220
and he offers you options.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.500
So what I wanted to say to people

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.500
if they want to have this treatment,

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.880
is that it's an optical illusion but it's real,

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.240
at no moment is it a tattoo,

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.500
nor is it painting on the head like some people,

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.200
unaware of the treatment,

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.740
might believe that it is.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.740
Well, the positive change

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.040
is the fact that I can look at myself in the mirror

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.300
and not see myself as I was before,

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.600
and it's obvious that I look much better than before.
