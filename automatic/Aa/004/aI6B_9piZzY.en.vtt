I<00:00:05.729> find<00:00:06.729> I<00:00:06.850> really<00:00:07.089> like<00:00:07.240> to<00:00:07.359> turn<00:00:07.769> Greenwood

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:08.769 
I find I really like to turn Greenwood

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:11.370 
I find I really like to turn Greenwood
what's<00:00:09.700> nice<00:00:09.940> about<00:00:09.970> turning<00:00:10.630> Greenwood<00:00:11.140> is

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:11.380 
what's nice about turning Greenwood is

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.530 
what's nice about turning Greenwood is
that<00:00:11.530> it<00:00:11.830> cuts<00:00:12.160> really<00:00:12.490> easily<00:00:12.850> so<00:00:12.970> you<00:00:13.240> can

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:13.540 
that it cuts really easily so you can

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.900 
that it cuts really easily so you can
you<00:00:13.810> can<00:00:13.960> turn<00:00:14.110> it<00:00:14.260> really<00:00:14.470> quickly<00:00:14.740> in<00:00:15.640> that

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:15.910 
you can turn it really quickly in that

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.820 
you can turn it really quickly in that
you<00:00:16.029> can<00:00:16.449> make<00:00:16.600> a<00:00:16.630> lot<00:00:16.840> of<00:00:16.869> progress<00:00:17.260> really

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:17.830 
you can make a lot of progress really

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.540 
you can make a lot of progress really
quickly<00:00:18.249> with<00:00:18.460> it<00:00:18.640> so<00:00:19.449> it's<00:00:19.660> a<00:00:19.749> lot<00:00:19.929> of<00:00:19.960> fun<00:00:20.550> but

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
quickly with it so it's a lot of fun but

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.429 
quickly with it so it's a lot of fun but
in<00:00:21.699> doing<00:00:21.999> that<00:00:22.150> and<00:00:22.449> in<00:00:22.570> making<00:00:22.779> that<00:00:22.960> that

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:23.439 
in doing that and in making that that

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:25.529 
in doing that and in making that that
quick<00:00:23.740> progress<00:00:24.039> you'd<00:00:24.550> make<00:00:24.759> a<00:00:24.789> lot<00:00:25.060> of<00:00:25.119> chips

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:25.539 
quick progress you'd make a lot of chips

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.729 
quick progress you'd make a lot of chips
I<00:00:26.099> get<00:00:27.099> chips<00:00:27.429> everywhere<00:00:27.909> and<00:00:28.359> they<00:00:29.320> build<00:00:29.589> up

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:29.739 
I get chips everywhere and they build up

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:32.519 
I get chips everywhere and they build up
in<00:00:29.980> it<00:00:30.099> one<00:00:30.730> even<00:00:31.329> just<00:00:31.359> one<00:00:31.779> turning<00:00:32.349> will

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
in it one even just one turning will

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.060 
in it one even just one turning will
make<00:00:32.739> quite<00:00:33.489> a<00:00:34.050> storm<00:00:35.050> of<00:00:35.260> chips<00:00:35.590> everywhere

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
make quite a storm of chips everywhere

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.790 
make quite a storm of chips everywhere
around<00:00:36.640> the<00:00:36.940> lathe<00:00:37.199> it<00:00:38.199> isn't<00:00:38.530> really<00:00:38.770> that

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
around the lathe it isn't really that

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.849 
around the lathe it isn't really that
big<00:00:39.219> of<00:00:39.309> a<00:00:39.399> deal<00:00:39.640> and<00:00:40.440> cleaning<00:00:41.440> them<00:00:41.590> up<00:00:41.680> from

00:00:41.849 --> 00:00:41.859 
big of a deal and cleaning them up from

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:43.290 
big of a deal and cleaning them up from
the<00:00:41.980> floor<00:00:42.280> is<00:00:42.489> really<00:00:42.519> easy<00:00:42.940> and

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
the floor is really easy and

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.069 
the floor is really easy and
straightforward<00:00:44.109> I<00:00:44.590> can<00:00:44.769> just<00:00:44.949> sweep<00:00:45.190> them<00:00:45.399> up

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
straightforward I can just sweep them up

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.569 
straightforward I can just sweep them up
but<00:00:47.079> where<00:00:47.260> it's<00:00:47.379> a<00:00:47.469> little<00:00:47.710> bit<00:00:47.800> of<00:00:47.920> a<00:00:48.010> pain<00:00:48.280> as

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
but where it's a little bit of a pain as

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:50.310 
but where it's a little bit of a pain as
where<00:00:49.239> they<00:00:49.329> don't<00:00:49.600> go<00:00:49.780> on<00:00:49.899> the<00:00:49.989> floor<00:00:50.260> and

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
where they don't go on the floor and

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.860 
where they don't go on the floor and
they<00:00:50.559> get<00:00:50.739> stuck<00:00:50.949> in<00:00:51.280> everything<00:00:51.730> and<00:00:52.510> I<00:00:52.570> have

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
they get stuck in everything and I have

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.229 
they get stuck in everything and I have
a<00:00:52.899> cabinet<00:00:53.859> next<00:00:54.129> to<00:00:54.370> the<00:00:54.460> lathe<00:00:54.760> that<00:00:54.789> I've

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
a cabinet next to the lathe that I've

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.540 
a cabinet next to the lathe that I've
made<00:00:55.480> years<00:00:56.019> and<00:00:56.260> years<00:00:56.440> ago<00:00:56.589> to<00:00:57.219> go<00:00:57.339> in<00:00:57.460> the

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
made years and years ago to go in the

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.700 
made years and years ago to go in the
house<00:00:57.730> but<00:00:58.149> there<00:00:58.660> wasn't<00:00:58.899> a<00:00:59.019> good<00:00:59.140> place<00:00:59.379> for

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
house but there wasn't a good place for

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.259 
house but there wasn't a good place for
it<00:00:59.829> in<00:00:59.980> the<00:01:00.160> new<00:01:00.309> house<00:01:00.519> so<00:01:00.789> I<00:01:00.850> have<00:01:01.030> it<00:01:01.149> out

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
it in the new house so I have it out

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.810 
it in the new house so I have it out
here<00:01:01.629> next<00:01:02.079> to<00:01:02.379> the<00:01:02.499> lathe<00:01:02.710> and<00:01:03.100> it<00:01:03.670> gets

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
here next to the lathe and it gets

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.330 
here next to the lathe and it gets
covered<00:01:04.330> in<00:01:04.510> chips<00:01:04.839> and<00:01:05.140> all<00:01:05.829> the<00:01:06.040> little

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
covered in chips and all the little

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.370 
covered in chips and all the little
tools<00:01:06.700> and<00:01:07.180> little<00:01:07.360> instruments<00:01:07.930> that<00:01:08.020> I<00:01:08.079> have

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
tools and little instruments that I have

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.190 
tools and little instruments that I have
get<00:01:08.590> covered<00:01:09.009> in<00:01:09.130> chips<00:01:09.509> so<00:01:10.509> to<00:01:10.600> clean<00:01:10.930> it<00:01:11.079> out

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
get covered in chips so to clean it out

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.469 
get covered in chips so to clean it out
I<00:01:11.259> usually<00:01:11.710> have<00:01:12.070> to<00:01:12.189> get<00:01:12.280> the<00:01:12.460> vacuum<00:01:12.820> out<00:01:13.180> and

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
I usually have to get the vacuum out and

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.480 
I usually have to get the vacuum out and
kind<00:01:13.689> of<00:01:13.780> carefully<00:01:14.290> go<00:01:14.470> around<00:01:14.829> and<00:01:15.070> vacuum

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
kind of carefully go around and vacuum

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.789 
kind of carefully go around and vacuum
up<00:01:15.610> all<00:01:15.850> the<00:01:15.909> chips<00:01:16.299> around<00:01:16.810> all<00:01:17.140> the<00:01:17.380> little

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
up all the chips around all the little

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:19.050 
up all the chips around all the little
instruments<00:01:18.579> and<00:01:18.729> little

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
instruments and little

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.600 
instruments and little
schools<00:01:19.360> and<00:01:19.540> pieces<00:01:19.960> so<00:01:20.920> what<00:01:21.310> I'd<00:01:21.430> like<00:01:21.549> to

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
schools and pieces so what I'd like to

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.030 
schools and pieces so what I'd like to
do<00:01:21.880> is<00:01:22.030> to<00:01:22.180> try<00:01:22.390> and<00:01:22.570> solve<00:01:22.840> this<00:01:23.140> problem<00:01:23.649> at

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
do is to try and solve this problem at

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.969 
do is to try and solve this problem at
least<00:01:24.280> at<00:01:24.579> the<00:01:24.790> cabinet<00:01:25.299> and<00:01:25.570> he<00:01:26.350> is<00:01:26.500> the<00:01:26.710> space

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
least at the cabinet and he is the space

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.590 
least at the cabinet and he is the space
of<00:01:27.009> the<00:01:27.250> cabinet<00:01:27.670> a<00:01:27.729> little<00:01:27.939> bit<00:01:28.060> better<00:01:30.600> so

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
of the cabinet a little bit better so

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.420 
of the cabinet a little bit better so
what<00:01:31.960> I'd<00:01:32.170> like<00:01:32.380> to<00:01:32.439> do<00:01:32.710> at<00:01:32.799> the<00:01:32.890> cabinet<00:01:33.310> thing

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
what I'd like to do at the cabinet thing

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.600 
what I'd like to do at the cabinet thing
is<00:01:33.579> to<00:01:33.759> make<00:01:33.970> three<00:01:34.890> doors<00:01:35.890> for<00:01:36.369> the<00:01:36.429> bigger

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
is to make three doors for the bigger

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.490 
is to make three doors for the bigger
spaces<00:01:36.939> and<00:01:37.299> then<00:01:37.420> three<00:01:37.689> drawers<00:01:38.110> for<00:01:38.439> the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
spaces and then three drawers for the

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.380 
spaces and then three drawers for the
smaller<00:01:38.860> spaces<00:01:39.399> and<00:01:39.580> I<00:01:39.610> think<00:01:40.000> I<00:01:40.090> think<00:01:40.119> that

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
smaller spaces and I think I think that

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.590 
smaller spaces and I think I think that
will<00:01:40.539> help<00:01:41.130> keep<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:42.340> chips<00:01:42.729> out<00:01:43.060> of<00:01:43.270> all<00:01:43.450> the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
will help keep the chips out of all the

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.340 
will help keep the chips out of all the
stuff<00:01:43.960> that's<00:01:43.990> in<00:01:44.350> here<00:01:44.619> and<00:01:45.429> I<00:01:46.210> need<00:01:46.509> to<00:01:46.750> fix<00:01:47.079> a

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
stuff that's in here and I need to fix a

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.800 
stuff that's in here and I need to fix a
piece<00:01:47.619> of<00:01:47.799> trim<00:01:48.070> and<00:01:48.399> I<00:01:48.670> like<00:01:49.149> to<00:01:49.240> make<00:01:49.360> a<00:01:49.390> shelf

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
piece of trim and I like to make a shelf

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.899 
piece of trim and I like to make a shelf
it<00:01:50.140> in<00:01:51.810> one<00:01:52.810> or<00:01:52.929> two<00:01:53.080> of<00:01:53.229> these<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:54.640> I<00:01:54.700> can

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
it in one or two of these so I can

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.350 
it in one or two of these so I can
measure<00:01:55.149> how<00:01:55.539> big<00:01:55.780> I<00:01:55.959> need<00:01:56.020> to<00:01:56.470> so<00:01:57.340> it's<00:01:57.459> 20<00:01:57.909> 21

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
measure how big I need to so it's 20 21

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.179 
measure how big I need to so it's 20 21
inches<00:01:58.780> and<00:01:59.049> the<00:01:59.950> width<00:02:00.220> is<00:02:00.630> 50<00:02:01.630> so<00:02:02.470> so<00:02:02.920> that's

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
inches and the width is 50 so so that's

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.330 
inches and the width is 50 so so that's
what<00:02:03.340> we'll<00:02:03.459> do<00:02:03.549> so<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:05.530> have<00:02:05.679> a<00:02:05.709> piece<00:02:06.099> of

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
what we'll do so I have a piece of

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.270 
what we'll do so I have a piece of
Russian<00:02:07.209> birch<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:08.619> it's<00:02:08.799> about<00:02:09.009> three

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
Russian birch and it's about three

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.130 
Russian birch and it's about three
quarters<00:02:09.580> in<00:02:09.700> each<00:02:09.819> state<00:02:10.179> I<00:02:10.330> think<00:02:10.569> it's<00:02:10.690> 18

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
quarters in each state I think it's 18

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.550 
quarters in each state I think it's 18
millimeter<00:02:12.569> from<00:02:13.569> this<00:02:13.780> I<00:02:13.930> can<00:02:14.080> cut<00:02:14.260> out<00:02:14.290> the

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
millimeter from this I can cut out the

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.690 
millimeter from this I can cut out the
doors<00:02:14.830> and<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.700> drawer<00:02:16.060> faces<00:02:17.280> now<00:02:18.280> for<00:02:18.580> the

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
doors and the drawer faces now for the

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.550 
doors and the drawer faces now for the
doors<00:02:19.150> I'd<00:02:19.450> like<00:02:19.630> to<00:02:19.750> use<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:20.290> hidden

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
doors I'd like to use the hidden

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.370 
doors I'd like to use the hidden
European<00:02:21.489> hinges<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.870> with<00:02:23.019> a<00:02:23.049> little

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
European hinges and with a little

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.349 
European hinges and with a little
measuring<00:02:23.859> and<00:02:24.070> a<00:02:24.100> little<00:02:24.340> math<00:02:24.549> I<00:02:24.820> think<00:02:25.150> I

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:25.359 
measuring and a little math I think I

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:27.509 
measuring and a little math I think I
figured<00:02:25.720> that<00:02:25.930> I<00:02:25.959> need<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.500> drill<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:27.250> main

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
figured that I need to drill the main

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.630 
figured that I need to drill the main
hole<00:02:28.209> for<00:02:28.570> the<00:02:28.660> hinge<00:02:29.040> three<00:02:30.040> millimeters

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
hole for the hinge three millimeters

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.990 
hole for the hinge three millimeters
from<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.209> edge<00:02:31.540> of<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.930> door<00:02:32.170> and<00:02:32.760> I'm<00:02:33.760> kind

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
from the edge of the door and I'm kind

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.140 
from the edge of the door and I'm kind
of<00:02:34.060> using<00:02:34.390> metric<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:36.280> hole<00:02:36.579> that<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.940> hinge

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
of using metric the hole that the hinge

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.120 
of using metric the hole that the hinge
needs<00:02:37.359> needs<00:02:37.720> to<00:02:37.840> be<00:02:37.989> a<00:02:38.230> thirty-five

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
needs needs to be a thirty-five

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.720 
needs needs to be a thirty-five
millimeter<00:02:39.519> in<00:02:40.269> diameter

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
millimeter in diameter

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.449 
millimeter in diameter
so<00:02:42.209> I<00:02:42.270> have<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.510> bit<00:02:43.410> that<00:02:43.650> drills<00:02:43.950> that's<00:02:44.220> nice

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
so I have a bit that drills that's nice

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.110 
so I have a bit that drills that's nice
cool<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:45.450> needs<00:02:45.629> to<00:02:45.810> be<00:02:46.310> 11<00:02:47.310> millimeters<00:02:47.819> team

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
cool it needs to be 11 millimeters team

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.580 
cool it needs to be 11 millimeters team
and<00:02:49.099> this<00:02:50.099> makes<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.459> lot<00:02:50.580> of<00:02:50.640> chips<00:02:50.970> too<00:02:51.530> so<00:02:52.530> you

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
and this makes a lot of chips too so you

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.190 
and this makes a lot of chips too so you
can<00:02:53.129> see<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.489> hinge<00:02:53.760> fits<00:02:54.209> into<00:02:54.510> that<00:02:54.540> hole<00:02:54.959> in

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
can see the hinge fits into that hole in

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.300 
can see the hinge fits into that hole in
the<00:02:55.230> door<00:02:55.550> and<00:02:56.750> I<00:02:57.750> can<00:02:57.900> make<00:02:57.989> it<00:02:58.110> Square<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:59.280> the

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
the door and I can make it Square to the

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.550 
the door and I can make it Square to the
door<00:02:59.760> and<00:03:00.030> then<00:03:00.209> clamp<00:03:00.510> one<00:03:00.810> side<00:03:01.080> in<00:03:01.290> place

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
door and then clamp one side in place

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.150 
door and then clamp one side in place
and<00:03:02.269> then<00:03:03.269> put<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.959> two<00:03:04.140> screws<00:03:04.530> in<00:03:04.709> that<00:03:04.739> hold

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
and then put the two screws in that hold

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.000 
and then put the two screws in that hold
the<00:03:05.370> hinge<00:03:05.610> on<00:03:06.269> the<00:03:06.360> door<00:03:06.630> and<00:03:06.900> then<00:03:07.709> on<00:03:07.890> the

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
the hinge on the door and then on the

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.479 
the hinge on the door and then on the
cabinet<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.549> little<00:03:08.819> foot<00:03:09.120> gets<00:03:09.360> attached<00:03:10.489> then

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
cabinet a little foot gets attached then

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.729 
cabinet a little foot gets attached then
the<00:03:11.670> piece<00:03:11.910> of<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.480> hinge<00:03:12.720> that<00:03:12.810> attaches<00:03:13.590> to

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
the piece of the hinge that attaches to

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.780 
the piece of the hinge that attaches to
the<00:03:13.860> door<00:03:14.269> snaps<00:03:15.269> into<00:03:15.569> that<00:03:15.780> foot<00:03:16.670> and<00:03:17.670> that's

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
the door snaps into that foot and that's

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.770 
the door snaps into that foot and that's
how<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.090> door<00:03:18.840> works<00:03:20.000> once<00:03:21.000> I<00:03:21.120> had<00:03:21.299> the<00:03:21.390> hinges

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
how the door works once I had the hinges

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.170 
how the door works once I had the hinges
on<00:03:21.959> and<00:03:22.260> adjusted<00:03:22.920> right<00:03:23.160> I<00:03:23.430> could<00:03:23.670> then<00:03:23.790> cut

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
on and adjusted right I could then cut

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.569 
on and adjusted right I could then cut
the<00:03:24.360> door<00:03:24.569> to<00:03:24.840> length<00:03:25.110> and<00:03:25.380> it<00:03:25.980> would<00:03:26.099> then<00:03:26.250> fit

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
the door to length and it would then fit

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.050 
the door to length and it would then fit
right<00:03:26.819> within<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.239> opening<00:03:27.630> of<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:27.989> shelf

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
right within the opening of the shelf

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.640 
right within the opening of the shelf
then<00:03:30.060> I<00:03:30.150> moved<00:03:30.390> on<00:03:30.569> to<00:03:30.599> fixing<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.410> little

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
then I moved on to fixing the little

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.770 
then I moved on to fixing the little
piece<00:03:31.769> of<00:03:31.950> trim<00:03:32.340> that<00:03:32.370> was<00:03:32.730> missing<00:03:33.180> on<00:03:33.360> the

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
piece of trim that was missing on the

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.220 
piece of trim that was missing on the
cabinet<00:03:34.260> I<00:03:34.760> had<00:03:35.760> done<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.209> trim<00:03:36.599> on<00:03:36.780> this<00:03:36.989> in

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
cabinet I had done the trim on this in

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.589 
cabinet I had done the trim on this in
Maple<00:03:37.769> and<00:03:38.040> I<00:03:38.190> found<00:03:38.790> a<00:03:38.910> little<00:03:39.120> scrap<00:03:39.390> piece

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
Maple and I found a little scrap piece

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.039 
Maple and I found a little scrap piece
of<00:03:39.720> maple<00:03:39.870> I<00:03:40.140> could<00:03:40.319> use<00:03:40.560> for<00:03:40.860> this<00:03:41.450> so<00:03:42.450> I<00:03:42.480> cut<00:03:43.019> a

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
of maple I could use for this so I cut a

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.780 
of maple I could use for this so I cut a
piece<00:03:43.290> to<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:43.530> right<00:03:43.620> size<00:03:44.010> and<00:03:44.400> Lane<00:03:44.549> and

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
piece to the right size and Lane and

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.740 
piece to the right size and Lane and
attach<00:03:45.090> that<00:03:45.120> I<00:03:46.280> wanted<00:03:47.280> to<00:03:47.340> add<00:03:47.609> a<00:03:47.670> shelf<00:03:48.239> so<00:03:48.690> I

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
attach that I wanted to add a shelf so I

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.280 
attach that I wanted to add a shelf so I
had<00:03:48.989> an<00:03:49.139> old<00:03:49.440> shelf<00:03:49.889> that<00:03:50.250> used<00:03:50.459> to<00:03:50.549> hold<00:03:50.819> a

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
had an old shelf that used to hold a

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.050 
had an old shelf that used to hold a
computer<00:03:52.290> monitor<00:03:52.500> back<00:03:53.069> back<00:03:53.400> before<00:03:53.819> we<00:03:53.940> had

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
computer monitor back back before we had

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.660 
computer monitor back back before we had
flat<00:03:54.329> screen<00:03:54.720> so<00:03:54.989> it<00:03:55.049> was<00:03:55.170> a<00:03:55.200> big<00:03:55.680> deep<00:03:56.010> shelf

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
flat screen so it was a big deep shelf

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.309 
flat screen so it was a big deep shelf
and<00:03:56.910> I<00:03:57.000> thought<00:03:57.420> I<00:03:57.480> could<00:03:57.690> cut<00:03:57.870> that<00:03:58.019> down<00:03:58.260> to

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
and I thought I could cut that down to

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.550 
and I thought I could cut that down to
make<00:03:58.739> a<00:03:58.769> shelf<00:03:59.160> for<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.579> cabinet<00:04:00.420> here<00:04:00.630> so<00:04:01.530> I

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
make a shelf for the cabinet here so I

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.440 
make a shelf for the cabinet here so I
used<00:04:01.859> some<00:04:01.980> more<00:04:02.250> that<00:04:02.400> maple<00:04:02.790> to<00:04:02.970> make<00:04:03.150> two

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
used some more that maple to make two

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.460 
used some more that maple to make two
supports<00:04:04.109> on<00:04:04.290> each<00:04:04.440> side<00:04:04.739> for<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.549> shelf

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.440 

then<00:04:09.220> the<00:04:09.370> last<00:04:09.550> thing<00:04:09.790> to<00:04:09.910> do<00:04:10.030> with<00:04:10.150> the<00:04:10.240> maple

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
then the last thing to do with the maple

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.380 
then the last thing to do with the maple
is<00:04:10.930> I<00:04:11.350> wanted<00:04:11.620> to<00:04:11.680> make<00:04:11.800> some<00:04:12.460> stops<00:04:12.820> for<00:04:13.300> the

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
is I wanted to make some stops for the

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.330 
is I wanted to make some stops for the
door<00:04:13.630> so<00:04:14.290> that<00:04:14.500> the<00:04:14.620> doors<00:04:14.860> would<00:04:15.130> have

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
door so that the doors would have

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.770 
door so that the doors would have
something<00:04:15.640> to<00:04:15.760> stop<00:04:16.150> against<00:04:16.510> when<00:04:16.750> they

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
something to stop against when they

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.370 
something to stop against when they
closed<00:04:18.420> then<00:04:19.420> the<00:04:19.450> next<00:04:19.780> thing<00:04:19.900> to<00:04:20.019> make<00:04:20.170> was

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
closed then the next thing to make was

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.090 
closed then the next thing to make was
the<00:04:20.560> drawers<00:04:21.660> and<00:04:22.660> I<00:04:22.780> had<00:04:22.960> some<00:04:23.200> roughly<00:04:23.830> half

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
the drawers and I had some roughly half

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.790 
the drawers and I had some roughly half
inch<00:04:24.370> Russian<00:04:24.940> birds<00:04:25.180> and<00:04:25.450> some<00:04:25.930> scrap<00:04:26.590> pieces

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
inch Russian birds and some scrap pieces

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.090 
inch Russian birds and some scrap pieces
I'd<00:04:27.220> used<00:04:27.660> for<00:04:28.660> a<00:04:28.690> project<00:04:28.930> at<00:04:29.440> some<00:04:29.710> point<00:04:29.980> in

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
I'd used for a project at some point in

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.040 
I'd used for a project at some point in
the<00:04:30.190> past<00:04:30.400> I<00:04:30.760> don't<00:04:30.970> even<00:04:31.300> remember<00:04:31.630> what

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
the past I don't even remember what

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.590 
the past I don't even remember what
these<00:04:32.230> were<00:04:32.440> from<00:04:32.770> they<00:04:33.610> made<00:04:34.090> good<00:04:34.390> pieces

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
these were from they made good pieces

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.800 
these were from they made good pieces
for<00:04:34.960> the<00:04:35.080> sides<00:04:36.180> so<00:04:37.180> I<00:04:37.210> wanted<00:04:37.570> to<00:04:37.660> make<00:04:37.780> a

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
for the sides so I wanted to make a

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.530 
for the sides so I wanted to make a
little<00:04:38.200> joint<00:04:38.560> that<00:04:39.070> would<00:04:39.250> help<00:04:39.400> hold<00:04:39.850> the

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
little joint that would help hold the

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.690 
little joint that would help hold the
front<00:04:40.870> and<00:04:41.050> back<00:04:41.230> on<00:04:41.590> a<00:04:41.650> little<00:04:42.160> better<00:04:42.400> when

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
front and back on a little better when

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.030 
front and back on a little better when
you<00:04:42.820> pull<00:04:43.390> on<00:04:43.540> the<00:04:43.660> drawer<00:04:43.960> so<00:04:44.620> I<00:04:44.650> made<00:04:45.010> a

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
you pull on the drawer so I made a

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.940 
you pull on the drawer so I made a
tongue<00:04:45.580> and<00:04:45.700> groove<00:04:45.790> for<00:04:46.330> that<00:04:46.510> I<00:04:46.840> did<00:04:47.800> the

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
tongue and groove for that I did the

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.950 
tongue and groove for that I did the
groove<00:04:48.520> on<00:04:48.730> the<00:04:48.850> table<00:04:49.180> saw<00:04:49.360> and<00:04:49.690> then<00:04:49.810> the

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
groove on the table saw and then the

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.530 
groove on the table saw and then the
tongue<00:04:50.200> on<00:04:50.530> the<00:04:50.740> radial<00:04:51.040> arm<00:04:51.190> saw<00:04:51.280> I<00:04:54.300> saw<00:04:55.300> the

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
tongue on the radial arm saw I saw the

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:02.940 
tongue on the radial arm saw I saw the
pieces<00:04:55.930> go<00:04:56.050> together<00:05:01.020> and<00:05:02.020> then<00:05:02.680> it<00:05:02.800> was<00:05:02.920> just

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
pieces go together and then it was just

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.440 
pieces go together and then it was just
a<00:05:03.190> matter<00:05:03.370> of<00:05:03.490> gluing<00:05:03.940> the<00:05:04.030> pieces<00:05:04.180> together

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
a matter of gluing the pieces together

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.840 
a matter of gluing the pieces together
and<00:05:05.580> clamping<00:05:07.920> part<00:05:08.920> of<00:05:08.980> the<00:05:09.070> process<00:05:09.520> was<00:05:09.670> to

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
and clamping part of the process was to

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.090 
and clamping part of the process was to
flip<00:05:10.180> the<00:05:10.720> piece<00:05:10.960> over<00:05:11.110> and<00:05:11.440> then<00:05:11.830> I<00:05:11.920> could

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
flip the piece over and then I could

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.360 
flip the piece over and then I could
glue<00:05:12.460> the<00:05:13.180> bottom<00:05:13.480> in<00:05:13.870> place<00:05:13.900> I<00:05:14.500> figured<00:05:15.160> since

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
glue the bottom in place I figured since

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.240 
glue the bottom in place I figured since
the<00:05:15.730> the<00:05:16.360> drawer<00:05:16.810> was<00:05:17.020> going<00:05:17.230> to<00:05:17.320> sit<00:05:17.710> on<00:05:17.890> the

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
the the drawer was going to sit on the

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.120 
the the drawer was going to sit on the
bottom<00:05:19.030> of<00:05:19.150> the<00:05:19.330> little<00:05:19.600> shelf<00:05:20.050> the<00:05:20.770> bottom

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
bottom of the little shelf the bottom

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.610 
bottom of the little shelf the bottom
didn't<00:05:21.400> need<00:05:21.520> to<00:05:21.550> be<00:05:21.820> as<00:05:22.030> attached<00:05:22.480> as<00:05:22.900> well<00:05:22.960> as

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
didn't need to be as attached as well as

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.750 
didn't need to be as attached as well as
a<00:05:23.650> drawer<00:05:24.370> would<00:05:25.120> normally<00:05:25.600> be<00:05:26.340> and<00:05:27.340> once<00:05:27.550> the

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:27.760 
a drawer would normally be and once the

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.390 
a drawer would normally be and once the
glue<00:05:28.060> is<00:05:28.090> dry<00:05:28.240> I<00:05:28.450> could<00:05:28.810> then<00:05:28.960> flush<00:05:29.740> trim<00:05:30.100> edge

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
glue is dry I could then flush trim edge

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.440 
glue is dry I could then flush trim edge
about<00:05:31.590> then<00:05:32.590> I<00:05:32.710> cut<00:05:32.950> the<00:05:33.190> faces<00:05:34.120> for<00:05:34.360> the

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.450 
about then I cut the faces for the

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:40.320 
about then I cut the faces for the
drawers<00:05:34.750> and<00:05:35.250> got<00:05:36.250> them<00:05:36.430> sized<00:05:36.960> perfectly<00:05:39.330> for

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
drawers and got them sized perfectly for

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.920 
drawers and got them sized perfectly for
attaching<00:05:41.140> the<00:05:41.520> faces<00:05:42.520> to<00:05:42.790> the<00:05:42.940> drawers<00:05:43.390> I

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
attaching the faces to the drawers I

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.710 
attaching the faces to the drawers I
shipped<00:05:44.740> the<00:05:45.400> face<00:05:45.700> up<00:05:45.970> just<00:05:46.360> a<00:05:46.480> little<00:05:46.510> bit

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
shipped the face up just a little bit

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.600 
shipped the face up just a little bit
you<00:05:46.930> can<00:05:47.080> see<00:05:47.320> the<00:05:47.530> shim<00:05:47.860> on<00:05:48.070> the<00:05:48.190> on<00:05:48.400> the

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
you can see the shim on the on the

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.960 
you can see the shim on the on the
bottom<00:05:48.970> of<00:05:49.090> the<00:05:49.270> face<00:05:49.900> there<00:05:50.320> and<00:05:50.560> I<00:05:51.460> attached

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
bottom of the face there and I attached

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.270 
bottom of the face there and I attached
the<00:05:52.390> face<00:05:52.690> from<00:05:53.290> the<00:05:53.350> front<00:05:54.000> with<00:05:55.000> two<00:05:55.300> screws

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
the face from the front with two screws

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.130 
the face from the front with two screws
and<00:05:57.280> once<00:05:57.520> that<00:05:57.790> was<00:05:57.850> done<00:05:58.270> I<00:05:58.540> could<00:05:58.720> pull<00:05:58.960> the

00:05:59.130 --> 00:05:59.140 
and once that was done I could pull the

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.980 
and once that was done I could pull the
drawer<00:05:59.440> out<00:06:00.150> it<00:06:01.150> was<00:06:01.330> time<00:06:01.540> to<00:06:01.570> make<00:06:01.750> some

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
drawer out it was time to make some

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.400 
drawer out it was time to make some
pulls<00:06:02.290> for<00:06:02.860> the<00:06:02.980> drawers<00:06:03.280> and<00:06:03.400> the<00:06:03.730> doors<00:06:04.410> the

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.410 
pulls for the drawers and the doors the

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.380 
pulls for the drawers and the doors the
thought<00:06:05.680> I<00:06:05.710> had<00:06:06.010> in<00:06:06.190> the<00:06:06.280> design<00:06:06.669> for<00:06:06.970> this<00:06:07.090> was

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:07.390 
thought I had in the design for this was

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:09.659 
thought I had in the design for this was
something<00:06:07.690> that<00:06:07.870> chips<00:06:08.470> wouldn't<00:06:08.950> get<00:06:09.190> stuck

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:09.669 
something that chips wouldn't get stuck

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:12.870 
something that chips wouldn't get stuck
on<00:06:09.940> of<00:06:10.840> the<00:06:11.230> little<00:06:11.530> long<00:06:11.740> curls<00:06:12.370> of<00:06:12.580> the<00:06:12.669> lathe

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 
on of the little long curls of the lathe
