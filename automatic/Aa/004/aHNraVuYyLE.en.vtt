knife flight if you don't know how to do

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.429 
knife flight if you don't know how to do
it<00:00:23.250> properly<00:00:23.400> then<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:23.970> suggest<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.660> watch<00:00:25.140> our

night flight video and then also you

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.780 
night flight video and then also you
need<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:29.099> fly<00:00:29.720> inverted<00:00:30.720> so<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.470> means

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 
need to fly inverted so that means

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.440 
need to fly inverted so that means
upside<00:00:32.790> down<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:34.940> if<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.090> don't<00:00:36.239> know<00:00:36.300> how<00:00:36.390> to

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
upside down and if you don't know how to

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.479 
upside down and if you don't know how to
do<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.780> properly<00:00:36.960> then<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.739> suggest<00:00:38.010> you

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
do that properly then I suggest you

watch<00:00:39.420> our<00:00:39.719> video<00:00:40.079> called<00:00:40.350> inverted<00:00:41.040> flight

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
watch our video called inverted flight

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.680 
watch our video called inverted flight
which<00:00:42.420> will<00:00:43.520> show<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.610> how<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.760> do<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.090> now

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
which will show you how to do this now

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.910 
which will show you how to do this now
why<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.200> point<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.649> do<00:00:46.770> these

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
why is the point that you do these

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.650 
why is the point that you do these
stunts<00:00:47.280> when<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.489> pass<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.850> markers<00:00:48.239> because

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
stunts when you pass the markers because

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.979 
stunts when you pass the markers because
if<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.170> even<00:00:49.320> correctly<00:00:50.420> like<00:00:51.420> on<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.719> right

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
if you even correctly like on the right

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.360 
if you even correctly like on the right
now

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.310 

you<00:00:54.969> might<00:00:55.660> just<00:00:55.690> get<00:00:56.199> a<00:00:56.260> couple<00:00:56.739> of<00:00:56.770> seconds

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
you might just get a couple of seconds

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.840 
you might just get a couple of seconds
scratched<00:00:59.320> off<00:00:59.559> your<00:00:59.890> current<00:01:00.219> time<00:01:00.489> which

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
scratched off your current time which

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.710 
scratched off your current time which
will<00:01:01.059> help<00:01:01.269> you<00:01:01.449> gain<00:01:02.230> the<00:01:02.680> gold<00:01:02.949> medal<00:01:03.579> so<00:01:04.540> the

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
will help you gain the gold medal so the

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.590 
will help you gain the gold medal so the
yellow<00:01:05.159> markers<00:01:06.159> are<00:01:06.490> very<00:01:07.090> easy<00:01:07.390> because

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
yellow markers are very easy because

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.450 
yellow markers are very easy because
I'll<00:01:07.900> need<00:01:08.020> to<00:01:08.110> do<00:01:08.229> is<00:01:08.380> fly<00:01:08.740> through<00:01:09.100> them

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
I'll need to do is fly through them

yeah that's why I'm pretty good at the

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.050 
yeah that's why I'm pretty good at the
inverter<00:01:35.259> flight<00:01:35.470> thing<00:01:35.649> I've<00:01:36.580> been<00:01:36.640> doing<00:01:36.789> it

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
inverter flight thing I've been doing it

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.450 
inverter flight thing I've been doing it
for<00:01:37.090> a<00:01:37.360> long<00:01:37.840> time<00:01:37.869> in<00:01:38.440> one<00:01:39.130> of<00:01:39.220> the<00:01:39.280> previous

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
for a long time in one of the previous

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.419 
for a long time in one of the previous
GTA<00:01:40.000> games<00:01:40.929> I<00:01:42.750> absolutely<00:01:43.750> loved<00:01:44.470> the<00:01:45.190> plane

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:45.429 
GTA games I absolutely loved the plane

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:48.090 
GTA games I absolutely loved the plane
physics<00:01:45.819> here<00:01:46.090> you<00:01:47.050> might<00:01:47.289> notice<00:01:47.679> that<00:01:47.710> the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
physics here you might notice that the

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.090 
physics here you might notice that the
plane<00:01:48.369> has<00:01:48.670> been<00:01:48.750> shaking<00:01:49.770> throughout<00:01:50.770> all<00:01:51.069> of

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
plane has been shaking throughout all of

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.270 
plane has been shaking throughout all of
the<00:01:51.490> videos<00:01:51.759> in<00:01:51.940> this<00:01:51.970> series<00:01:53.009> that's<00:01:54.009> not<00:01:54.159> my

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
the videos in this series that's not my

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.080 
the videos in this series that's not my
fault<00:01:54.340> it's<00:01:54.759> not<00:01:55.590> yeah<00:01:56.590> because<00:01:57.490> I'm<00:01:57.819> bad<00:01:57.970> at

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
fault it's not yeah because I'm bad at

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.880 
fault it's not yeah because I'm bad at
piloting<00:01:58.450> or<00:01:58.509> something<00:01:58.840> it's<00:01:59.229> just<00:01:59.470> the<00:01:59.560> wind

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
piloting or something it's just the wind

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.839 
piloting or something it's just the wind
if<00:02:00.670> there's<00:02:01.270> a<00:02:01.360> lot<00:02:01.539> of<00:02:01.660> wind<00:02:01.810> then<00:02:02.670> your<00:02:03.670> plane

00:02:03.839 --> 00:02:03.849 
if there's a lot of wind then your plane

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:05.969 
if there's a lot of wind then your plane
might<00:02:04.060> start<00:02:04.270> to<00:02:04.360> shake<00:02:04.569> and<00:02:04.720> you<00:02:04.840> might<00:02:05.050> start

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
might start to shake and you might start

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.400
