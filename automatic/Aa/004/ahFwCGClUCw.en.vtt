00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.310 
know maybe just open it up you know over
something<00:03:04.930> I<00:03:05.019> know<00:03:05.280> you'll<00:03:06.280> figure<00:03:06.400> it<00:03:06.549> out

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
something I know you'll figure it out

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.580 
something I know you'll figure it out
but<00:03:08.320> yeah<00:03:08.500> those<00:03:08.769> are<00:03:08.920> them<00:03:09.070> with<00:03:09.730> gloves

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
but yeah those are them with gloves

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.710 
but yeah those are them with gloves
pretty<00:03:11.590> decent<00:03:11.709> gloves<00:03:12.330> I'll<00:03:13.330> probably<00:03:13.540> do

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
pretty decent gloves I'll probably do

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.530 
pretty decent gloves I'll probably do
some<00:03:13.780> sparring<00:03:14.260> with<00:03:14.440> them<00:03:14.650> or<00:03:15.030> actually<00:03:16.030> um

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
some sparring with them or actually um

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.520 
some sparring with them or actually um
my<00:03:16.780> just<00:03:18.150> some<00:03:19.150> bag<00:03:19.330> training<00:03:19.720> and<00:03:19.870> recorded

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
my just some bag training and recorded

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.060 
my just some bag training and recorded
prism<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:22.150> as<00:03:22.299> you<00:03:22.390> can<00:03:22.480> see<00:03:22.540> 14<00:03:23.530> ounces

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
prism and as you can see 14 ounces

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.740 
prism and as you can see 14 ounces
I'm<00:03:25.030> guessing<00:03:27.120> obviously<00:03:28.120> the<00:03:28.209> 16<00:03:28.510> ounces

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
I'm guessing obviously the 16 ounces

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.560 
I'm guessing obviously the 16 ounces
would<00:03:28.900> be<00:03:28.989> bigger<00:03:29.200> and<00:03:29.830> more<00:03:30.370> padding<00:03:30.760> but<00:03:31.060> I

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
would be bigger and more padding but I

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.550 
would be bigger and more padding but I
went<00:03:31.900> with<00:03:32.019> the<00:03:32.080> 14<00:03:32.410> ounces<00:03:33.630> yeah<00:03:34.660> so<00:03:34.930> that's

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
went with the 14 ounces yeah so that's

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.530 
went with the 14 ounces yeah so that's
that<00:03:35.830> if<00:03:36.100> you're<00:03:36.430> looking<00:03:36.820> to<00:03:36.970> buy<00:03:37.060> these<00:03:37.120> ones
