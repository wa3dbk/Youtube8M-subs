two things that that are identical two

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.460 
two things that that are identical two
designs<00:05:30.390> obviously<00:05:31.390> I'm<00:05:31.480> gonna<00:05:31.630> say<00:05:31.870> that

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
designs obviously I'm gonna say that

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.610
