00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.080
 hello girls how about I do not know how 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:13.790
 proposed in the title of the video but in 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.139
 this video we are going to talk about water and 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.910
 I said it in a previous video that I wanted 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.189
 make a video related to water and 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.689
 the importance of drinking water is very 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.820
 important to drink a liter and a half to 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.470
 two liters a day and you've heard 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.570
 millions of times every time you put on 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.430
 to diet but is that without dieting 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.650
 this is what should be done to drink a 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.210
 liter and a half or two a day because that's how 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.550
 is cleaning the body because we are 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.809
 moisturizes the skin the skin all our 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.879
 body will work better if we are 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.650
 sufficiently hydrated then what 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.269
 what is usually said is to drink from a 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.799
 liter and a half to two a day 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:46.190
 there are people who retain a lot of fluids and 

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:48.260
 I read this in forums and other 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.790
 and in articles that there are people who do 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
 Holds a lot of fluids 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.790
 drink a lot of water but there are other people who 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.400
 recommends not drinking it because if the 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.080
 baby accumulates most of the 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.839
 opinions is that you drink a lot of water but 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.400
 for example, in pregnancy I am already 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:03.799
 retain normal liquids in the 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.110
 pregnancy as they are retained more then 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:07.790
 the gynecologist would not let me drink anything from 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.430
 water just a glass of water to eat and 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.810
 another for dinner I do not know I think it's 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.730
 better to drink more water but I in the 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.230
 pregnancy I was listening to him but that told me 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.240
 that as it retained many liquids because 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.650
 His feet were very swollen and that's 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.150
 that he only drank two glasses of water 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.130
 day to moisturize even that eat 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.350
 a lot of fruit a lot of fruit but of course the 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.760
 fruit already has fructose and others a trick 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.950
 to drink the necessary water that you already 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.600
 I said it makes a lot of time that I 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.720
 I did it in Castellón because over there 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.850
 the 2008 of 2009 as it cost me 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.040
 I drink a lot of water because I got a little leaf 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.409
 so in this the one that put the days and 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.150
 put 10 squares each box was going 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.790
 tachan or if I drank a glass of water and 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.710
 every glass of water that I drank so 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.120
 I was aiming and what I was doing was that 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.800
 I drank a glass of water and I started 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.150
 day I drank a glass of water when I 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.210
 they wanted to piss 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.860
 then I used to go to the kitchen I drank 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.780
 another glass of water was crossed out I was going to 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.330
 pee and like that all day and drank the 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.950
 glasses without any problem of course this if 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.330
 you are working and you are not at home and 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.760
 so it's more complicated but if 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.710
 you are at home doing it because you see them 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.989
 the liter and a half a day without realizing 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.940
 other things to help us drink the 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.200
 fasting water they say it's good that I 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.489
 I was doing it also in castelló 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.230
 the truth that I was doing pretty well eh 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.659
 Now I've been doing three or four days 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.090
 if I remember is to drink a glass of water 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:22.400
 warm not hot 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.040
 not frozen either, templadita with 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.890
 juice of half a lemon and that makes like 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.610
 that the colon was better cleaned and vital than 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.500
 let's do better of belly in that doing of 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.760
 belly that touches us and good because this 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.739
 I 'm doing it and the truth is that 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.319
 ok but I do not have problems either 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.910
 to go to the bathroom not to be specific things 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.730
 but good if you want to do it say that 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.790
 It's good if we do not drink a glass of water 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.280
 whether it's from how you have it 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.390
 also tempered time before 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.160
 have breakfast to see if you get used to 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.720
 because this is also very good 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.730
 then she would have a glass of water 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.739
 then mid-morning we can take 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.500
 an infusion we already have two glasses of 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.569
 water to eat three glasses of water to 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.730
 the snack four glasses of water in the 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.620
 dinner another five glasses of water between 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.799
 snack and dinner what we can do is 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.510
 take put some infusion or if not a 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.670
 kind of this I do not know if you have 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.560
 seen in more videos that are drinks 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.030
 boleros are some powder like tan 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.920
 all of life what happens that they do not have 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.000
 calories and so on then it comes in handy 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.280
 to do 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.290
 because if you do not like the infusions 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.090
 well this has a million flavors 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.000
 but a lot I 'm going to leave the page 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.000
 web below and you make a little cup with the 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.190
 snack or after eating or whatever 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.740
 when I give you the little thing because then that 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:40.130
 they do not have caffeine they do not have ends like 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.870
 it can be coffee or clear tea and if not 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.420
 they have calories and then the water 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.280
 It is not a drink and without all soda 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.170
 but you throw this and then what 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.060
 It tastes richer also with these envelopes 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.590
 since I am you can make recipes and 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.410
 others that you will have there on the page 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.120
 web you see how to get them in the 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.250
 recipes that flavors can be made 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.200
 that there is everything then that too 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.390
 the infusions are very good if you 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.070
 they like it perfect because with the 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.260
 infusions already you are drinking the glass 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:09.500
 of water or the amount that you make a 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.390
 infusion and that is because it is water besides 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.520
 depend on the infusion that is because 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.959
 help is good green tea the tail of 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.019
 horse and all this well for the 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.459
 antioxidant organism and others os 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.100
 I recommend that you do the glasses of 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.810
 water if you do not cross us out 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.460
 every time you have to go to the bathroom 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.870
 You will drink a glass of water if there is not 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.850
 people also put in a bottle 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.670
 two liters or one and a half liters and 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.070
 begins to drink will be during the morning and 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.480
 it's over for the night I the truth is 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.910
 that water glasses work better 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:41.330
 and cash them worth telling then to 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.770
 this does not leave not fall the sack broken 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.290
 what I'm going to do is see if you follow me 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.750
 and to see if you cheer up is to create a 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.610
 hashtag in instagram that will be 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.290
 Pad eight glasses a day then 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.510
 with that hashtag what I'm going to do is 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.880
 upload photos of I have three glasses 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.280
 then look at an infusion and with this I have 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.780
 four glasses and so then those that I 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.520
 follow by instagram I have it 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.560
 linked with twitter and with facebook to 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.840
 go see the photos you will go remembering 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.300
 before, yes, I have only drunk a glass of 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.800
 water and you know that way we remember it 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.200
 and we are helping each other in you 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.780
 if you want to use it by uploading 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.420
 a photo whatever and put the hashtag 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.310
 eight glasses a day and then the glasses that 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.440
 take and so to see if both 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.230
 we are remembering them with this 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.510
 hashtag and I'll be two weeks to a month 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.720
 it depends on the acceptance and how you see that 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.400
 it's working I do not know 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.200
 so it has occurred to me and I hope that 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.790
 it's not helpful to drink more water than 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.010
 is very good and nothing up here the video 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.780
 I hope you join my challenge and in the 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.390
 social networks we are cheering and 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.430
 giving tricks to drink more water and so 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:44.220
 Well, being completely hydrated does not 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:46.380
 just to put new ones a bit in the 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.720
 thread of the ' bikini operation ' but for 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.220
 have the best skin the best hair and everything 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.660
 and until the video that is made very 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.660
 we are strong in the next goodbye 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.320
 ah
