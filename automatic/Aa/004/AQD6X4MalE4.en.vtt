00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
the unit's not located at the top so we

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.280 
the unit's not located at the top so we
have<00:02:38.160> an<00:02:38.250> air<00:02:38.400> filter<00:02:38.640> here<00:02:39.030> for<00:02:39.239> that<00:02:39.360> fan<00:02:39.630> so

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
have an air filter here for that fan so

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.229 
have an air filter here for that fan so
that<00:02:40.320> we<00:02:40.530> doesn't<00:02:41.190> get<00:02:41.310> mucked<00:02:41.790> up<00:02:41.880> with<00:02:42.060> dirt

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
that we doesn't get mucked up with dirt

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.620 
that we doesn't get mucked up with dirt
and<00:02:42.360> dust<00:02:42.540> things<00:02:42.840> like<00:02:42.989> that<00:02:44.420> take<00:02:45.420> it<00:02:45.540> around

wear and that's a very good thing
especially<00:04:43.160> in<00:04:43.550> these<00:04:43.730> machines<00:04:44.180> that<00:04:44.660> tend

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
especially in these machines that tend

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.470 
especially in these machines that tend
to<00:04:44.930> be<00:04:45.190> heavily<00:04:46.190> used<00:04:46.580> for<00:04:46.790> gaming<00:04:47.240> and

to be heavily used for gaming and
stressed<00:04:48.020> often<00:04:48.980> on<00:04:49.340> the<00:04:49.610> back<00:04:49.820> here<00:04:50.150> we<00:04:50.630> have

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
stressed often on the back here we have

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.860 
stressed often on the back here we have
seven<00:04:51.590> quick-release<00:04:52.100> PCI<00:04:52.669> spots<00:04:53.060> so<00:04:53.720> all<00:04:53.780> you

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
seven quick-release PCI spots so all you

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.720 
seven quick-release PCI spots so all you
have<00:04:53.960> to<00:04:54.050> do<00:04:54.140> is<00:04:54.230> flip<00:04:54.440> that<00:04:54.590> out<00:04:54.770> pull<00:04:55.460> it<00:04:55.550> out

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
have to do is flip that out pull it out

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.930 
have to do is flip that out pull it out
and<00:04:56.169> then<00:04:57.169> this<00:04:57.530> will<00:04:57.830> come<00:04:57.860> out<00:04:58.190> now<00:04:58.640> right

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
and then this will come out now right

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.000 
and then this will come out now right
now<00:04:59.090> because<00:04:59.390> this<00:05:00.080> is<00:05:00.230> a<00:05:00.290> brand<00:05:00.560> new<00:05:00.590> unit

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
now because this is a brand new unit

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.409 
now because this is a brand new unit
they<00:05:01.430> do<00:05:01.490> still<00:05:01.820> have<00:05:01.910> the<00:05:02.000> metal<00:05:02.240> piece

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
they do still have the metal piece

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:03.790 
they do still have the metal piece
holding<00:05:02.780> them<00:05:02.870> in<00:05:02.960> place<00:05:02.990> so<00:05:03.380> we're<00:05:03.500> not<00:05:03.590> going

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
holding them in place so we're not going

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.200 
holding them in place so we're not going
to<00:05:03.830> pop<00:05:04.160> that<00:05:04.370> out<00:05:04.400> but<00:05:04.669> that's<00:05:04.790> just<00:05:04.970> for

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
to pop that out but that's just for

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.420 
to pop that out but that's just for
display<00:05:05.740> and<00:05:06.740> then<00:05:06.860> all<00:05:06.980> you<00:05:07.070> have<00:05:07.160> to<00:05:07.250> do<00:05:07.340> is

display and then all you have to do is

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.040 
display and then all you have to do is
pop<00:05:07.640> that<00:05:07.820> back<00:05:07.970> in<00:05:08.180> and<00:05:08.540> you're<00:05:08.660> good<00:05:08.810> to<00:05:08.900> go
