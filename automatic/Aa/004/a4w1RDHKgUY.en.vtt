00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.240
 the first one with tranquility because this 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.960
 it is the week of more or less we had 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.730
 to rest and well beyond it 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.650
 it's a lot because it's something that is not 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.420
 get every day 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.010
 and it served to rest to clean a 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.660
 little bit the head because we have a 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.449
 semester very very complicated the one that comes 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.559
 and we have to think that it's not going to be 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.510
 easy because we have two competitions 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.900
 important and joana that is up to 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.900
 Of the two 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.680
 so it's something very nice always what 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.920
 better than there is to play followed the afternoon 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.390
 good not rest much because 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.200
 that makes the game catch pace 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.970
 make her feel better 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.370
 look at us where the best effort 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.110
 in the league that where we play Sunday 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.630
 Thursday is like that and in the liberators cup 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.760
 it happens the same not to be the party in 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.900
 three weeks one is always in rhythm 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.140
 no but you also have to handle the 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.790
 charges because you can not play 50% 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.610
 that fourth of the 100% matches and 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.810
 that's why it's good that the campus is 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.520
 complete that is well well tucked in and 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.380
 knowing that everyone can have their 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.560
 opportunity at any time and that 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.479
 surely liked because for something he 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.860
 asked some players and the squad 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.220
 I think it's very good for 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.220
 face it 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.569
 and that only what we always 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.920
 we do and we are better than proven 

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:36.229
 it does not help us if we are favorites 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.700
 because the reality that if you touch 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.350
 America's favorite garments is 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.600
 america any term first by 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.799
 last champion and the reality is that the 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.020
 holy saints themselves ended up 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.759
 with our saint who already had the the 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.920
 small advantage of the game against them and 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.049
 to have won but later to Morelia 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.140
 we could not beat him locally either and 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:56.539
 it was easy that's why I think there's always 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.890
 that look at the near target and the 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:59.509
 close goal is the next match 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.860
 what we have if we were always the 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.750
 mentality that and that's why I think that 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.509
 we got championship because we do not think 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.630
 beyond the next game and what 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.759
 maybe one 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.380
 I finished a game with as I told you with 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.110
 america wanting to do he thinks that already 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.640
 it was and we thought it was not no 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.840
 there was nothing defined because that's why 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.670
 we went out to play to death so we did 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.560
 with the entrance because always now 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.700
 same there and that was I think the key 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.700
 to get championships 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.150
 there were moments in all three of the three 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.189
 games let's say in the split of 180 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.480
 minutes that we did not have a good time because the 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:38.360
 another team also plays another team 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.189
 does things well and I think that in 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.870
 each one there is a little dot that one 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:43.400
 he felt rewarded more than anything in the 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.560
 morelia first game and then you 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.420
 won 3 to 1 when in the last minutes 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.930
 we tied the game there was not not 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.069
 we passed the same thing with saints after 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.989
 that nothing in the first goal has 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.209
 we are lucky to make a quick goal 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.639
 and that already kills the party but also in 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.910
 At that time we were not calm either 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:04.780
 himself with america 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.780
 1 to 0 of local 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:12.079
 well they were attacking and also got off 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:15.230
 a little bit, that's why he talks about 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:16.969
 our proposal that beyond that 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.319
 maybe not being well in the party that 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:19.969
 the team is surpassing us 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.739
 we were always looking for the 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:23.450
 rival arch and that's why they also arrived 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.390
 those goals and I think those goals were 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.190
 keys also like to 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.690
 close the series in a way because 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.640
 when the team is attacking you 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.440
 another team attacks you and presses you 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.600
 volume is a goal there is nothing against that 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.490
 physically 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.330
 and psychically the other team falls and 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.330
 It's what we did 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.939
 as importance in the line logically 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.739
 because the goals that have the 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:52.709
 championship maybe both with america and 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:55.230
 the saints because the three will arrive in 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.810
 a key just moment of sant or as 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.000
 I tell you we were in a difficult time 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.859
 I was on a goal from 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.290
 stay them with the classification and if 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:06.900
 and then something our side of America 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.219
 because they were the second was that I tell you 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.290
 that they are attacking us a lot and 

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:11.639
 every second our part more than anything 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.549
 by definition a very definition 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:16.709
 linda entered a place that perhaps was and 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:18.630
 only where they could give and then the 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.150
 first in the second leg with 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.370
 America because I believe that inside 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.380
 america at that time knew that no longer 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.740
 I had no way of turning 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.740
 match 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.080
 I do not like to talk before I ever do 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:38.170
 things and I wanted to demonstrate first 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.180
 everything what that is talked about me and with 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.550
 that mold that one comes before arriving 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.500
 and well I think I could show it and 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.000
 now now that just keep 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.480
 and keep doing things as the 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.480
 past tournament 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.210
 and I think very good very good all 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.500
 not because of the actions I had for the 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.420
 goals I made for the amount of goals 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.700
 what I did and above all things for 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:05.490
 the team leaves champion 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.960
 maybe there were people who did not know much 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.400
 the Mexican soccer that did not know the 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.330
 I said as football and has been a 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.150
 team that is newly promoted 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.919
 maybe for something else and I knew that 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.080
 being the coach that was the 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:18.449
 way I had to play the team did not 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.460
 I'm going to make a mistake 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:24.240
 I spoke before being with the coach 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.749
 and he told me how the team plays, he told me 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.430
 I needed and why I think 

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:31.289
 I chose here was not fundamental at the time 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.539
 to make the decision and I'm very 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:34.650
 thankful that he has given me the 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:36.689
 opportunity to come here because 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.099
 I knew that I will not be wrong of it 

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:39.479
 I trusted a lot in what I could give and 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:41.249
 thanks to them but you can 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:43.400
 give back with goals and with good 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:43.400
 performances 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.710
 I'm adding words all matosas 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:54.160
 it's like that 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:56.050
 he does not admit that a player believes more 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.330
 that the rest beyond that they are still 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.190
 because inwardly he makes us 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:03.090
 feel the best and he always tells us 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.090
 for me you are the best 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:11.670
 Although I have happy holidays happy year and 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:14.370
 I was very happy to know of him 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:16.830
 could give the championship because it's a 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:19.890
 cute gift for christmas to finish 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.750
 the year and well let's hope that 

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:23.370
 finish everything very well the year and 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.570
 I appreciate all the support that I 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.570
 they gave me and the whole team day by day 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.260
 Y
