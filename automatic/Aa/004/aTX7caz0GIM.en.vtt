sort of 16th note triplets and by

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.460 
sort of 16th note triplets and by
showing<00:02:21.269> up<00:02:21.450> on<00:02:21.569> a<00:02:21.600> bass<00:02:21.810> drums<00:02:22.080> in<00:02:22.230> between

showing up on a bass drums in between

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:47.060 
showing up on a bass drums in between
them<00:02:22.590> ok<00:02:23.280> we<00:02:23.519> count<00:02:23.850> it<00:02:24.120> like<00:02:45.799> it's<00:02:46.799> really

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
them ok we count it like it's really

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.650 
them ok we count it like it's really
hard<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:47.430> keep<00:02:47.579> them<00:02:47.730> consistent<00:02:47.910> all<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.420> way

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
hard to keep them consistent all the way

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.930 
hard to keep them consistent all the way
through<00:02:48.829> but<00:02:49.829> I<00:02:50.040> suppose<00:02:50.250> that<00:02:50.430> part<00:02:50.670> of<00:02:50.790> fun<00:02:50.910> a

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
through but I suppose that part of fun a

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.170 
through but I suppose that part of fun a
bit<00:02:51.150> challenging<00:02:51.959> oneself<00:02:52.280> ok<00:02:53.280> so<00:02:53.340> start<00:02:54.150> off

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
bit challenging oneself ok so start off

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.699 
bit challenging oneself ok so start off
with<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.480> first<00:02:54.690> example<00:02:54.900> this<00:02:55.380> is<00:02:55.530> a<00:02:55.560> good

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
with the first example this is a good

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:56.750 
with the first example this is a good
easy<00:02:55.950> one<00:02:56.190> to<00:02:56.310> start<00:02:56.519> with

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
easy one to start with

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.640 
easy one to start with
or<00:02:56.970> it's<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.480> first<00:02:57.690> one<00:02:57.900> on<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.019> sheet<00:02:58.260> music

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
or it's the first one on the sheet music

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.349 
or it's the first one on the sheet music
and<00:02:58.799> what<00:02:59.760> we're<00:02:59.880> doing<00:03:00.120> is<00:03:00.180> we're<00:03:00.329> putting

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359 
and what we're doing is we're putting

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:10.069 
and what we're doing is we're putting
through<00:03:01.079> the<00:03:01.260> play<00:03:08.870> done

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
through the play done

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:18.660 
through the play done
ok<00:03:10.530> so<00:03:10.590> you<00:03:10.769> get<00:03:10.920> this

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.040 

never<00:03:19.670> the<00:03:19.790> track<00:03:20.000> actually<00:03:20.210> bottom<00:03:20.780> puts<00:03:20.960> an

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
never the track actually bottom puts an

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.540

extra based on the end before what you
sound<00:03:22.730> like<00:03:22.850> this<00:03:42.370> okay<00:03:43.570> just<00:03:44.570> try<00:03:44.780> and<00:03:44.840> relax

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020

I<00:03:45.410> find<00:03:45.680> sometimes<00:03:45.860> I<00:03:46.100> tense<00:03:46.400> up<00:03:46.610> a<00:03:46.700> bit<00:03:46.850> when

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
I find sometimes I tense up a bit when

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.460 
I find sometimes I tense up a bit when
I'm<00:03:47.060> playing<00:03:47.209> the<00:03:47.330> hi-hat<00:03:47.540> so<00:03:47.959> it<00:03:48.020> sounds<00:03:48.380> a

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
I'm playing the hi-hat so it sounds a

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.040 
I'm playing the hi-hat so it sounds a
bit<00:03:48.500> bit<00:03:49.130> more<00:03:49.160> stiff<00:03:49.670> on<00:03:49.880> there<00:03:50.090> and<00:03:50.900> I'm

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
bit bit more stiff on there and I'm

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.360 
bit bit more stiff on there and I'm
consciously<00:03:51.380> trying<00:03:51.620> to<00:03:51.680> sort<00:03:51.860> of<00:03:51.920> like<00:03:52.100> you

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
consciously trying to sort of like you

know<00:03:52.400> I'm<00:03:52.670> always<00:03:52.850> adjusting<00:03:53.390> trying<00:03:53.600> to

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
know I'm always adjusting trying to

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.050 
know I'm always adjusting trying to
improve<00:03:54.110> myself<00:03:54.320> so<00:03:55.070> just<00:03:55.100> be<00:03:55.520> patient<00:03:55.730> this

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
improve myself so just be patient this

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.290 
improve myself so just be patient this
why<00:03:56.180> it<00:03:56.239> does<00:03:56.450> take<00:03:56.660> a<00:03:56.690> bit<00:03:56.810> of<00:03:56.930> time<00:03:58.300> another

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
why it does take a bit of time another

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.920 
why it does take a bit of time another
one<00:03:59.570> he<00:03:59.750> does<00:04:00.010> this<00:04:01.010> is<00:04:01.130> from<00:04:01.310> the<00:04:01.430> second

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
one he does this is from the second

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.560 
one he does this is from the second
hardest<00:04:02.930> one<00:04:03.260> and<00:04:04.209> although<00:04:05.209> it's<00:04:05.330> not<00:04:05.390> that

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
hardest one and although it's not that

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.270 
hardest one and although it's not that
bad<00:04:05.690> but<00:04:05.900> towards<00:04:06.620> the<00:04:06.650> end<00:04:06.830> of<00:04:06.890> the<00:04:06.980> song<00:04:07.130> you

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
bad but towards the end of the song you

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:17.310 
bad but towards the end of the song you
just<00:04:07.489> hit<00:04:07.670> crop<00:04:08.060> up<00:04:08.239> once<00:04:08.510> and<00:04:09.020> he<00:04:09.170> plays<00:04:09.410> bass

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.840 

which<00:04:18.320> is<00:04:18.380> a<00:04:18.440> snare<00:04:18.830> drum<00:04:18.859> just<00:04:19.340> back<00:04:19.489> a<00:04:19.519> tiny

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
which is a snare drum just back a tiny

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:29.670 
which is a snare drum just back a tiny
bit<00:04:20.120> onto<00:04:20.359> the<00:04:20.450> end<00:04:20.600> of<00:04:20.780> four<00:04:20.989> to<00:04:21.200> get<00:04:21.320> this

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.810 

which<00:04:30.680> I<00:04:30.830> really<00:04:31.070> like<00:04:31.160> the<00:04:31.250> sound<00:04:31.430> like<00:04:31.610> this

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
which I really like the sound like this

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.000 
which I really like the sound like this
or<00:04:32.000> just<00:04:32.210> like<00:04:32.960> I<00:04:33.050> said<00:04:33.169> it<00:04:33.290> any<00:04:33.410> pops<00:04:33.620> up<00:04:33.800> one

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
or just like I said it any pops up one

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.590 
or just like I said it any pops up one
so<00:04:34.220> it<00:04:34.280> really<00:04:34.430> stands<00:04:34.729> out<00:04:34.910> on<00:04:35.060> the<00:04:35.120> track<00:04:35.390> now

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
so it really stands out on the track now

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.230 
so it really stands out on the track now
there's<00:04:36.110> another<00:04:36.350> bit<00:04:36.820> it<00:04:37.820> kicks<00:04:38.000> in<00:04:38.120> about

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
there's another bit it kicks in about

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.150 
there's another bit it kicks in about
the<00:04:38.360> third<00:04:38.720> verse<00:04:39.050> after<00:04:39.350> than<00:04:39.590> a<00:04:39.650> guitar<00:04:39.919> solo

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
the third verse after than a guitar solo

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.700 
the third verse after than a guitar solo
he<00:04:40.850> just<00:04:41.030> goes<00:04:41.180> out<00:04:41.360> to<00:04:41.540> the<00:04:41.630> v8<00:04:41.750> with<00:04:42.080> it<00:04:42.200> here

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
he just goes out to the v8 with it here

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.830 
he just goes out to the v8 with it here
for<00:04:42.919> about<00:04:43.160> a<00:04:43.190> bar<00:04:43.490> and<00:04:43.669> a<00:04:43.700> half<00:04:43.910> and<00:04:44.419> I'll<00:04:44.630> try

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
for about a bar and a half and I'll try

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.840 
for about a bar and a half and I'll try
and<00:04:44.870> play<00:04:45.169> it<00:04:45.229> without<00:04:45.470> well<00:04:46.220> I'll<00:04:46.550> try<00:04:46.760> and

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
and play it without well I'll try and

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.940 
and play it without well I'll try and
make<00:04:46.910> it<00:04:47.150> sort<00:04:47.479> of<00:04:47.570> do<00:04:48.050> a<00:04:48.080> bit<00:04:48.290> of<00:04:48.320> justice<00:04:48.740> and

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
make it sort of do a bit of justice and

00:04:48.950 --> 00:05:02.640 
make it sort of do a bit of justice and
that's

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.720 

that's<00:05:03.650> a<00:05:03.770> really<00:05:04.010> tricky<00:05:04.100> one<00:05:04.310> to<00:05:04.580> keep

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
that's a really tricky one to keep

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.280 
that's a really tricky one to keep
playing<00:05:05.060> on<00:05:05.210> and<00:05:05.360> consistent<00:05:05.810> the<00:05:05.930> way<00:05:06.050> he

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
playing on and consistent the way he

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.310 
playing on and consistent the way he
does<00:05:07.330> but<00:05:08.330> again<00:05:08.540> it's<00:05:08.780> just<00:05:08.900> a<00:05:08.930> real<00:05:09.140> good

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
does but again it's just a real good

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.960 
does but again it's just a real good
exercise<00:05:09.710> and<00:05:09.740> you<00:05:10.040> can<00:05:10.160> start<00:05:10.370> chopping<00:05:10.850> and

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
exercise and you can start chopping and

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.640 
exercise and you can start chopping and
changing<00:05:11.120> it<00:05:11.480> and<00:05:11.570> displacing<00:05:12.290> where<00:05:12.530> you

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
changing it and displacing where you

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.130 
changing it and displacing where you
want<00:05:12.800> to<00:05:12.920> start<00:05:13.160> it<00:05:13.400> and<00:05:14.180> things<00:05:14.480> like<00:05:14.660> that<00:05:14.720> so

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
want to start it and things like that so

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.930 
want to start it and things like that so

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
around the kit actually found it easier

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.060 
around the kit actually found it easier
