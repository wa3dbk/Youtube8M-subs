hello youtube this is a video for my
physics<00:00:04.470> project<00:00:04.680> and<00:00:05.690> what<00:00:06.690> it<00:00:06.810> is<00:00:06.930> is<00:00:07.230> a<00:00:07.259> shoe

stars<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.910> make<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.330> look<00:00:21.449> nice<00:00:21.630> no<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:25.400> when

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
stars to make it look nice no and when

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.279 
stars to make it look nice no and when
I'm<00:00:26.609> going<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.820> play<00:00:26.970> some<00:00:27.029> some<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.260> know

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
I'm going to play some some you know

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:58.400 
I'm going to play some some you know
notes<00:00:28.619> on<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:55.340> now<00:00:56.340> if<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.670> notice<00:00:56.930> as<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:58.140> move

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
notes on you now if you notice as I move

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.760 
notes on you now if you notice as I move
my<00:00:58.620> hand<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.190> right<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.109> guitar<00:01:01.109> the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
my hand to the right of the guitar the

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.640 
my hand to the right of the guitar the
pitch<00:01:02.010> becomes<00:01:03.000> higher<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:04.049> reason<00:01:04.409> for<00:01:04.439> this

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
pitch becomes higher the reason for this

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.219 
pitch becomes higher the reason for this
is<00:01:04.949> because<00:01:05.060> the<00:01:06.060> rubber<00:01:06.270> band<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.720> much

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
is because the rubber band is much

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.060 
is because the rubber band is much
smaller<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:09.110> when<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.229> length<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.619> decreased

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
smaller and when the length is decreased

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.700 
smaller and when the length is decreased
the<00:01:12.590> the<00:01:13.590> pic<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.310> gonna<00:01:14.430> be<00:01:14.939> higher<00:01:15.560> like<00:01:16.560> you

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
the the pic is gonna be higher like you

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.420 
the the pic is gonna be higher like you
see<00:01:16.950> right<00:01:16.979> now<00:01:20.930> now<00:01:21.930> as<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.439> move<00:01:22.680> my<00:01:22.799> hand<00:01:23.040> over

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
see right now now as I move my hand over

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.010 
see right now now as I move my hand over
back<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.820> left<00:01:24.060> with<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.330> big<00:01:24.570> rubber<00:01:24.720> band

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
back to the left with a big rubber band

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.130 
back to the left with a big rubber band
this<00:01:25.560> one<00:01:25.799> right<00:01:25.950> here<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:29.520> sound<00:01:29.880> is

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
this one right here the sound is

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.999 
this one right here the sound is
obviously<00:01:31.140> going<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.380> be<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.530> lower<00:01:31.740> pitch

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
obviously going to be a lower pitch

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.080 
obviously going to be a lower pitch
because<00:01:32.909> on<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.570> guitar<00:01:34.490> this<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.820> six

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
because on the guitar this the six

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.810 
because on the guitar this the six
strings<00:01:36.420> move<00:01:37.229> from<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.829> lowest<00:01:38.159> pitch<00:01:38.369> to

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
strings move from the lowest pitch to

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.609 
strings move from the lowest pitch to
the<00:01:38.939> highest<00:01:39.150> pitch<00:01:39.479> or<00:01:39.799> left<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.920> right<00:01:41.299> so

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
the highest pitch or left to right so

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:53.929 
the highest pitch or left to right so
this<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.799> how<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.040> will<00:01:44.159> sound<00:01:50.299> now<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:53.490> two

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
this is how it will sound now the two

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.660 
this is how it will sound now the two
ways<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.229> increase<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.500> pitch<00:01:55.680> are<00:01:55.920> to

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
ways to increase the pitch are to

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.880 
ways to increase the pitch are to
increase<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.360> tension<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:58.409> make<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.740> rubber

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
increase the tension to make the rubber

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.260 
increase the tension to make the rubber
band<00:01:59.130> much<00:01:59.759> tighter<00:02:00.439> which<00:02:01.439> yeah<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.579> proper

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
band much tighter which yeah I proper

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.010 
band much tighter which yeah I proper
you<00:02:03.420> don't<00:02:03.600> know<00:02:03.659> how<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.810> do<00:02:04.079> so<00:02:04.950> yeah<00:02:06.020> that

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
you don't know how to do so yeah that

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.749 
you don't know how to do so yeah that
obviously<00:02:07.469> isn't<00:02:07.649> going<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.920> work<00:02:08.009> for<00:02:08.640> me

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
obviously isn't going to work for me

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.309 
obviously isn't going to work for me
right<00:02:08.789> now<00:02:08.940> because<00:02:09.720> this<00:02:09.840> is<00:02:09.989> not<00:02:10.080> actually

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
right now because this is not actually

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.309 
right now because this is not actually
taught<00:02:10.739> but<00:02:11.610> uh<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.270> other<00:02:12.360> way<00:02:12.540> is

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
taught but uh and the other way is

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.550 
taught but uh and the other way is
to<00:02:13.670> decrease<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.969> length<00:02:15.329> or<00:02:15.599> the<00:02:15.689> government

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
to decrease the length or the government

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.429 
to decrease the length or the government
which<00:02:17.549> in<00:02:17.819> this<00:02:18.329> program<00:02:18.689> right<00:02:18.870> here<00:02:19.139> has

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:19.439 
which in this program right here has

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:24.679 
which in this program right here has
cost<00:02:20.189> I<00:02:20.569> scratched<00:02:21.569> it<00:02:21.749> much<00:02:22.530> more<00:02:23.150> than<00:02:24.150> some

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:24.689 
cost I scratched it much more than some

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:27.949 
cost I scratched it much more than some
other<00:02:24.870> augments<00:02:25.319> on<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:26.129> fretboard<00:02:26.749> as<00:02:27.749> you

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
other augments on the fretboard as you

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.379 
other augments on the fretboard as you
hear<00:02:28.139> it<00:02:28.260> play<00:02:28.819> right<00:02:29.819> now<00:02:29.849> I'm<00:02:30.060> going<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.239> play

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:30.389 
hear it play right now I'm going to play

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:32.330 
hear it play right now I'm going to play
just<00:02:30.599> a<00:02:30.840> couple<00:02:31.200> notes<00:02:31.530> about<00:02:31.920> three<00:02:32.219> or<00:02:32.250> four

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
just a couple notes about three or four

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:58.789 
just a couple notes about three or four
or<00:02:32.609> five<00:02:32.760> something<00:02:33.239> like<00:02:33.329> that<00:02:57.650> all<00:02:58.650> right
