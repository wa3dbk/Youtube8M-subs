00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.030
 ah 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:22.480
 hello friends are greeted by your friend what 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.279
 in under 37 this time I bring you 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.490
 a good help for the guitar game 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.880
 hero 3 well this takes quite the 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.650
 slowness of the game when playing 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.780
 this puts you on the black screen when 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:38.280
 you start a song and it takes away the 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.280
 animations all that 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.610
 well this file is downloaded and what 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.610
 decompress 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.940
 these files are the important ones for 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.309
 this will need to locate the folder of the 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.640
 guitar hero 3 where you have 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.640
 installed 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.300
 in the data folder of our game what 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.940
 what we are going to do is copy the link of 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:32.800
 access we click and copy the 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:43.510
 address to the file we click 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:45.820
 right edit here we select the 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.400
 address without the quotes like I do 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.400
 I then give you right click paste 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.290
 and we keep the changes we will do it with 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.430
 the three missing files to be able 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.430
 patching the game 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.870
 well now what we will do is open three 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.930
 files starting with total 2 then 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.230
 we open the black bg file and then with 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.230
 cheer up 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.690
 the restore file is to restore the 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.350
 guitar hero 3 so to put it 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.350
 like before 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.180
 well this would be completely 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.940
 gone to play without - lag or slowness 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.840
 that causes them to their good pc here 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.840
 I show the gameplay 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.640
 well once inside the game we're going to 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.640
 options 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.980
 here we lower the screen resolution 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:41.270
 for the minimum and also the rest so 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.270
 lower the lag a little more 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.189
 and that's how the game would be 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.290
 the change is really noticeable 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:09.069
 Remove all the side I recommend a 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.069
 100% 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.600
 help you subscribe and like the 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.600
