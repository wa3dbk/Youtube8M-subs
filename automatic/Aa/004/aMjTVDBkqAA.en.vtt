00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.820 
for predicting a switch which I didn't
because<00:03:51.100> I<00:03:51.280> just<00:03:51.640> stunts<00:03:51.940> Ford<00:03:52.330> so<00:03:53.110> he<00:03:53.650> would

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
because I just stunts Ford so he would

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.100 
because I just stunts Ford so he would
be<00:03:53.950> slower<00:03:54.310> in<00:03:54.519> the<00:03:54.640> Sun<00:03:54.910> because<00:03:55.360> rob<00:03:55.870> blum

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
be slower in the Sun because rob blum

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.509 
be slower in the Sun because rob blum
solar<00:03:56.410> beam<00:03:56.680> can<00:03:56.860> actually<00:03:57.100> write<00:03:57.280> the<00:03:57.310> rest

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
solar beam can actually write the rest

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:03.270 
solar beam can actually write the rest
of<00:03:57.640> my<00:03:57.730> team<00:03:58.980> so<00:03:59.980> yeah<00:04:01.290> now<00:04:02.290> I<00:04:02.320> call<00:04:02.739> some<00:04:03.040> on

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
of my team so yeah now I call some on

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.520 
of my team so yeah now I call some on
sunny<00:04:03.850> d<00:04:04.060> back<00:04:04.330> so<00:04:04.630> i<00:04:04.690> can<00:04:04.720> send<00:04:05.049> in<00:04:05.140> hitmonchan

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
sunny d back so i can send in hitmonchan

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.620 
sunny d back so i can send in hitmonchan
so<00:04:06.250> i<00:04:06.280> know<00:04:06.370> i<00:04:06.459> can<00:04:06.549> take<00:04:06.850> a<00:04:06.880> hidden<00:04:07.180> power<00:04:07.360> fire

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
so i know i can take a hidden power fire

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.289 
so i know i can take a hidden power fire
in<00:04:07.780> the<00:04:07.840> sun<00:04:08.459> she<00:04:09.459> said<00:04:09.640> when<00:04:09.820> she<00:04:09.850> and<00:04:10.000> special

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
in the sun she said when she and special

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.840 
in the sun she said when she and special
defense<00:04:10.540> is<00:04:10.720> pretty<00:04:10.900> high<00:04:11.220> now<00:04:12.220> i'm<00:04:12.430> hoping<00:04:12.760> i

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
defense is pretty high now i'm hoping i

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.520 
defense is pretty high now i'm hoping i
wake<00:04:13.060> up<00:04:13.120> so<00:04:13.480> i<00:04:13.510> can<00:04:13.570> get<00:04:13.750> an<00:04:13.870> ice<00:04:13.989> punch<00:04:14.260> off

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
wake up so i can get an ice punch off

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.770 
wake up so i can get an ice punch off
but<00:04:14.860> i<00:04:14.890> still<00:04:15.340> don't<00:04:15.400> wake<00:04:15.880> up<00:04:16.090> and<00:04:16.359> he<00:04:16.450> kills

but i still don't wake up and he kills
me<00:04:16.989> off<00:04:17.109> with<00:04:17.440> solar<00:04:17.979> beam<00:04:18.250> overpower<00:04:19.239> kill

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
me off with solar beam overpower kill

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.599 
me off with solar beam overpower kill
much<00:04:20.020> but<00:04:20.590> anyway

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
explosion and I just after finding out

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.300 
explosion and I just after finding out
he<00:05:19.479> did<00:05:19.689> I<00:05:19.719> still<00:05:20.050> life<00:05:20.229> grumpig<00:05:20.590> and<00:05:20.740> I<00:05:20.979> and

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
I I could have easily won this match but

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.350 
I I could have easily won this match but
no<00:05:27.990> so<00:05:28.990> I<00:05:29.020> send<00:05:29.409> in<00:05:29.560> and<00:05:29.770> caught<00:05:30.039> on<00:05:30.069> and<00:05:30.490> he

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
no so I send in and caught on and he

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.420 
no so I send in and caught on and he
does<00:05:31.569> send<00:05:31.750> in<00:05:31.930> violin<00:05:32.319> which<00:05:32.560> I<00:05:32.650> kinda<00:05:33.069> wanted

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
does send in violin which I kinda wanted

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.790 
does send in violin which I kinda wanted
so<00:05:34.029> i<00:05:34.060> can<00:05:34.270> aerial<00:05:34.690> ace<00:05:34.839> and<00:05:35.110> hoping<00:05:35.589> it

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
so i can aerial ace and hoping it

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.480
