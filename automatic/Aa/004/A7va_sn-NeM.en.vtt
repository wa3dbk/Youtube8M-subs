same<00:01:56.969> loop<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.479> pull<00:01:57.990> up<00:01:58.079> now<00:01:58.380> not<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.770> be

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
same loop and pull up now not to be

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.999 
same loop and pull up now not to be
confused<00:01:59.479> there's<00:02:00.479> two<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:01.530> wouldn't<00:02:01.829> want

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
confused there's two you wouldn't want

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.649 
confused there's two you wouldn't want
to<00:02:02.070> go<00:02:02.219> between<00:02:02.430> these<00:02:02.820> two<00:02:03.060> vertical<00:02:03.360> bars

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
to go between these two vertical bars

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.929 
to go between these two vertical bars
there<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.500> front<00:02:04.770> vertical<00:02:05.040> bar<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:05.700> two

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
there the front vertical bar of two

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.609 
there the front vertical bar of two
different<00:02:06.240> loops<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:06.990> if<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.170> look<00:02:07.320> closely

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
different loops so if you look closely

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.619 
different loops so if you look closely
again<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.520> want<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.789> go<00:02:08.910> through<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.360> front

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
again you want to go through the front

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.790 
again you want to go through the front
and<00:02:09.869> back<00:02:10.259> vertical<00:02:11.009> bars<00:02:11.250> of<00:02:11.580> one<00:02:12.480> given<00:02:13.110> loop

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
and back vertical bars of one given loop

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.790 
and back vertical bars of one given loop
so<00:02:14.490> do<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:14.850> and<00:02:15.060> we'll<00:02:15.420> just<00:02:15.450> work<00:02:15.870> that<00:02:16.410> same

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
so do that and we'll just work that same

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.950 
so do that and we'll just work that same
thing<00:02:17.070> across<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.430> whole<00:02:17.790> row<00:02:18.030> we<00:02:18.510> insert

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
thing across the whole row we insert

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.840 
thing across the whole row we insert
between<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.700> bars<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:21.060> work<00:02:21.870> across<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.560> row

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
between the bars and work across the row

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.520 
between the bars and work across the row
this<00:02:23.850> swatch<00:02:24.720> that<00:02:24.750> I'm<00:02:25.080> doing<00:02:25.170> today<00:02:25.380> and

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
this swatch that I'm doing today and

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.650 
this swatch that I'm doing today and
also<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.190> neck<00:02:26.370> warmer<00:02:26.550> our<00:02:26.850> work<00:02:27.360> in<00:02:27.570> a

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
also the neck warmer our work in a

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.290 
also the neck warmer our work in a
really<00:02:28.080> soft<00:02:28.380> acrylic<00:02:28.890> yarn<00:02:29.280> which<00:02:29.850> is<00:02:30.030> great

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
really soft acrylic yarn which is great

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.520 
really soft acrylic yarn which is great
for<00:02:30.480> something<00:02:30.870> that's<00:02:31.020> going<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.200> be<00:02:31.320> so

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
for something that's going to be so

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.100 
for something that's going to be so
close<00:02:31.770> to<00:02:31.800> your<00:02:32.130> neck<00:02:32.810> okay<00:02:33.810> so<00:02:33.870> we're<00:02:34.080> just

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
close to your neck okay so we're just

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.450 
close to your neck okay so we're just
going<00:02:34.320> to<00:02:34.380> work<00:02:34.530> this<00:02:34.590> across<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.580> entire<00:02:36.510> row

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
going to work this across the entire row

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.300 
going to work this across the entire row
I'm<00:02:39.020> going<00:02:40.020> a<00:02:40.050> little<00:02:40.110> faster<00:02:40.710> just<00:02:40.920> so<00:02:41.040> we<00:02:41.160> can

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
I'm going a little faster just so we can

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.100 
I'm going a little faster just so we can
get<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.700> end<00:02:41.880> and<00:02:42.090> you<00:02:42.690> know<00:02:42.720> once<00:02:43.050> you

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
get to the end and you know once you

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.470 
get to the end and you know once you
start<00:02:43.200> going<00:02:43.620> I<00:02:43.890> mean<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.160> repetitive<00:02:44.760> stitch

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
start going I mean the repetitive stitch

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.360 
start going I mean the repetitive stitch
is<00:02:45.690> really<00:02:46.080> easy<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.410> remember<00:02:46.710> what<00:02:47.010> you<00:02:47.160> once

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
is really easy to remember what you once

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.830 
is really easy to remember what you once
you<00:02:47.490> keep<00:02:47.640> going<00:02:47.940> so<00:02:48.090> just<00:02:48.270> going<00:02:48.420> into<00:02:48.750> the

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
you keep going so just going into the

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.140 
you keep going so just going into the
front<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:49.320> back<00:02:49.590> vertical<00:02:50.460> bar<00:02:50.610> of<00:02:50.850> each<00:02:51.000> of

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
front and back vertical bar of each of

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.510 
front and back vertical bar of each of
these<00:02:51.240> loops<00:02:51.510> across<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:52.110> row<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:52.560> then<00:02:53.370> the

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
these loops across the row and then the

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.270 
these loops across the row and then the
return<00:02:53.910> is<00:02:54.410> really<00:02:55.410> really<00:02:55.710> easy<00:02:55.890> it's<00:02:56.160> going

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
return is really really easy it's going

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.360 
return is really really easy it's going
to<00:02:56.370> be<00:02:56.490> the<00:02:56.580> exact<00:02:57.000> same<00:02:57.090> as<00:02:57.570> the<00:02:57.630> other

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
to be the exact same as the other

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.590 
to be the exact same as the other
Tunisian<00:02:59.370> stitch<00:02:59.490> that<00:02:59.790> we<00:02:59.940> did<00:03:00.090> last<00:03:00.300> season

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
Tunisian stitch that we did last season

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.400 
Tunisian stitch that we did last season
and<00:03:01.230> that<00:03:02.100> is<00:03:02.340> yarn<00:03:03.180> over<00:03:03.450> hook<00:03:03.480> pull<00:03:04.380> through

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
and that is yarn over hook pull through

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.980 
and that is yarn over hook pull through
one<00:03:04.950> for<00:03:05.490> the<00:03:05.550> first<00:03:05.790> stitch<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:06.270> then<00:03:06.750> yarn

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
one for the first stitch and then yarn

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.350 
one for the first stitch and then yarn
over<00:03:07.290> pull<00:03:07.530> through<00:03:07.560> two<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.160> you're<00:03:09.150> going

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
over pull through two and you're going

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.360 
over pull through two and you're going
to<00:03:09.450> repeat<00:03:09.750> that<00:03:09.810> across<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.770> remainder<00:03:11.100> of

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
to repeat that across the remainder of

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.080 
to repeat that across the remainder of
the<00:03:11.880> row<00:03:12.080> so<00:03:13.080> we'll<00:03:13.200> do<00:03:13.320> that<00:03:13.470> slow<00:03:13.830> yarn<00:03:14.790> over

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
the row so we'll do that slow yarn over

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.199 
the row so we'll do that slow yarn over
pull<00:03:15.480> through<00:03:15.510> two<00:03:16.070> yarn<00:03:17.070> over<00:03:17.370> pull<00:03:17.580> through

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
pull through two yarn over pull through

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.720 
pull through two yarn over pull through
two<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:19.020> then<00:03:19.350> as<00:03:19.590> you<00:03:19.740> keep<00:03:19.890> going<00:03:20.280> you<00:03:20.700> can

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
two and then as you keep going you can

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.840 
two and then as you keep going you can
really<00:03:21.510> speed<00:03:21.780> it<00:03:21.900> up<00:03:22.020> but<00:03:22.620> what<00:03:23.430> I<00:03:23.459> would<00:03:23.700> like

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
really speed it up but what I would like

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.580 
really speed it up but what I would like
to<00:03:24.060> mention<00:03:24.270> though<00:03:24.630> is<00:03:24.780> that<00:03:24.810> if<00:03:25.170> you<00:03:25.350> make<00:03:25.530> a

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
to mention though is that if you make a

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.230 
to mention though is that if you make a
mistake<00:03:25.830> at<00:03:26.220> this<00:03:26.310> point<00:03:26.580> let's<00:03:26.760> say<00:03:26.880> I<00:03:26.940> go

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
mistake at this point let's say I go

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.060 
mistake at this point let's say I go
through<00:03:27.540> three<00:03:27.900> it's<00:03:28.500> really<00:03:28.830> not<00:03:28.920> a<00:03:28.980> problem

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
through three it's really not a problem

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.420 
through three it's really not a problem
you<00:03:29.459> just<00:03:29.610> skip<00:03:30.209> it<00:03:30.240> right<00:03:30.600> back<00:03:30.810> down<00:03:31.430> lay

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
you just skip it right back down lay

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.330 
you just skip it right back down lay
them<00:03:32.640> back<00:03:32.670> out<00:03:33.320> just<00:03:34.320> like<00:03:34.440> that

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
them back out just like that

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.250 
them back out just like that
this<00:03:35.670> pattern<00:03:36.120> is<00:03:36.270> also<00:03:36.720> going<00:03:36.990> to<00:03:37.110> be

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
this pattern is also going to be

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.440 
this pattern is also going to be
available<00:03:37.350> on<00:03:37.860> the<00:03:37.920> website<00:03:38.430> where<00:03:39.030> it'll

so<00:03:46.530> we'll<00:03:46.650> just<00:03:46.800> good<00:03:47.250> across<00:03:47.610> the<00:03:47.850> rest<00:03:48.060> of

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
so we'll just good across the rest of

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.280 
so we'll just good across the rest of
this<00:03:48.360> row<00:03:49.550> -<00:03:50.550> -<00:03:51.000> to<00:03:51.240> see<00:03:51.540> how<00:03:51.660> you<00:03:51.720> really<00:03:52.020> can

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
this row - - to see how you really can

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.960 
this row - - to see how you really can
build<00:03:52.620> up<00:03:52.770> your<00:03:52.800> speed<00:03:53.070> as<00:03:53.340> you're<00:03:53.520> going<00:03:53.670> and

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
build up your speed as you're going and

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.020 
build up your speed as you're going and
I<00:03:54.209> just<00:03:54.450> wanted<00:03:54.690> to<00:03:54.750> show<00:03:54.990> you<00:03:55.050> see<00:03:55.709> how<00:03:56.030> see

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
I just wanted to show you see how see

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.750 
I just wanted to show you see how see
how<00:03:57.060> that<00:03:57.360> looks<00:03:57.630> like<00:03:57.900> that<00:03:58.620> nice<00:03:59.100> clean<00:03:59.490> V

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
how that looks like that nice clean V

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.820 
how that looks like that nice clean V
line<00:04:00.060> of<00:04:00.270> a<00:04:00.330> stockinette<00:04:00.900> what<00:04:01.440> I'm<00:04:01.530> going<00:04:01.800> to

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
line of a stockinette what I'm going to

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.340 
line of a stockinette what I'm going to
do<00:04:02.070> now<00:04:02.340> is<00:04:02.550> just<00:04:02.760> show<00:04:02.850> you<00:04:03.030> that<00:04:03.180> on<00:04:03.480> each<00:04:03.840> row

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
do now is just show you that on each row

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.100 
do now is just show you that on each row
going<00:04:04.650> forward<00:04:05.340> it<00:04:05.490> even<00:04:06.090> gets<00:04:06.330> easier<00:04:06.810> so<00:04:07.020> we

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
going forward it even gets easier so we

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.300 
going forward it even gets easier so we
do<00:04:07.200> a<00:04:07.230> chain<00:04:07.530> one<00:04:07.740> at<00:04:07.830> the<00:04:07.920> beginning<00:04:08.010> of<00:04:08.220> the

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
do a chain one at the beginning of the

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.250 
do a chain one at the beginning of the
row<00:04:08.430> see<00:04:09.030> how<00:04:09.120> those<00:04:09.270> vertical<00:04:09.810> lines<00:04:09.840> are<00:04:10.230> a

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
row see how those vertical lines are a

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.500 
row see how those vertical lines are a
lot<00:04:10.530> more<00:04:10.560> apparent<00:04:11.220> on<00:04:11.340> this<00:04:11.550> row<00:04:11.760> that's<00:04:12.209> how

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
lot more apparent on this row that's how

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.540 
lot more apparent on this row that's how
every<00:04:12.870> row<00:04:13.050> going<00:04:13.290> forward<00:04:13.800> is<00:04:13.890> going<00:04:13.980> to<00:04:14.250> look

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
every row going forward is going to look

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.120 
every row going forward is going to look
so<00:04:14.730> we're<00:04:14.850> going<00:04:14.940> to<00:04:15.000> work<00:04:15.300> into<00:04:16.049> the<00:04:16.919> two

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
so we're going to work into the two

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.590 
so we're going to work into the two
vertical<00:04:17.609> bars<00:04:17.640> like<00:04:18.090> that

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
vertical bars like that

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.740 
vertical bars like that
and<00:04:19.220> once<00:04:20.220> you<00:04:20.400> do<00:04:20.700> that<00:04:20.940> on<00:04:21.090> this<00:04:21.239> row<00:04:21.450> you<00:04:21.480> can

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
and once you do that on this row you can

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.050 
and once you do that on this row you can
even<00:04:21.930> see<00:04:22.260> how<00:04:22.470> I<00:04:22.680> mean<00:04:23.370> it<00:04:23.490> just<00:04:23.640> starts

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
even see how I mean it just starts

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.690 
even see how I mean it just starts
showing<00:04:24.270> the<00:04:24.570> pattern<00:04:24.780> even<00:04:25.290> more<00:04:25.500> on<00:04:25.700> the

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
showing the pattern even more on the

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.680 
showing the pattern even more on the
previous<00:04:27.150> row

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
previous row

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.400 
previous row

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
and that second color yarn by the way

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.620 
and that second color yarn by the way
was<00:04:31.590> only<00:04:31.980> for<00:04:32.160> this<00:04:32.310> part<00:04:32.610> the<00:04:32.820> we're<00:04:33.450> only
