00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
flecks of crystal flash in the water

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.000 
flecks of crystal flash in the water
it's<00:03:02.739> a<00:03:02.860> different<00:03:03.190> reflection<00:03:03.310> from<00:03:03.879> the<00:03:04.030> Sun

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
it's a different reflection from the Sun

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.580

and<00:03:06.010> now<00:03:06.250> we're<00:03:06.340> gonna<00:03:06.459> take<00:03:06.670> some<00:03:07.590> sparkle

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
and now we're gonna take some sparkle

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.819 
and now we're gonna take some sparkle

we'll roll them nicely right on top of

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:31.910 
we'll roll them nicely right on top of
quick<00:03:28.810> shank<00:03:29.310> I'm<00:03:30.310> gonna<00:03:30.489> skew<00:03:30.790> them<00:03:31.030> down

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
quick shank I'm gonna skew them down

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.680 
quick shank I'm gonna skew them down
I'll<00:03:32.920> take<00:03:33.099> anywhere<00:03:33.340> I<00:03:33.430> want<00:03:33.670> I<00:03:33.819> can<00:03:34.030> wrap

the<00:03:43.090> legs<00:03:43.299> and<00:03:43.739> trim<00:03:44.739> them<00:03:44.920> a<00:03:44.950> little<00:03:45.160> short

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.770 

shorter<00:03:48.549> than<00:03:48.700> the<00:03:48.790> other<00:03:48.940> two<00:03:49.209> just<00:03:49.660> look

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
shorter than the other two just look

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.220 
shorter than the other two just look
gives<00:03:49.959> you<00:03:50.049> a<00:03:50.079> little<00:03:50.380> extra<00:03:51.090> wiggle

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.470 

so<00:03:55.800> it's<00:03:55.950> not<00:03:56.040> cooperating<00:03:56.730> here<00:03:56.940> but<00:03:57.180> we'll

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
so it's not cooperating here but we'll

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.199 
so it's not cooperating here but we'll
get<00:03:57.599> her<00:03:57.720> going<00:03:58.020> here<00:03:58.200> in<00:03:58.260> a<00:03:58.319> second

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
get her going here in a second

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.680 
get her going here in a second
there<00:04:00.209> you<00:04:00.330> go<00:04:00.770> and<00:04:02.090> pretty<00:04:03.090> much<00:04:03.239> done<00:04:03.660> with

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
this one super easy tan shrimp it you

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.030 
this one super easy tan shrimp it you
can<00:04:06.360> throw<00:04:06.480> this<00:04:06.599> on<00:04:06.780> like<00:04:07.110> a<00:04:07.140> tan<00:04:07.560> coral

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
can throw this on like a tan coral

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.080 
can throw this on like a tan coral
bottom<00:04:08.430> or<00:04:08.489> you<00:04:08.550> can<00:04:08.670> throw<00:04:08.760> this<00:04:08.910> on<00:04:09.030> a

bottom or you can throw this on a

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.790 
bottom or you can throw this on a
lighter<00:04:09.330> sand<00:04:09.690> bottom<00:04:10.170> and<00:04:10.319> it<00:04:10.500> will<00:04:10.530> blend

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
lighter sand bottom and it will blend

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.600 
lighter sand bottom and it will blend
right<00:04:10.920> in<00:04:11.190> because<00:04:11.370> there's<00:04:11.550> no<00:04:13.610> separate
