00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.230 
but I actually even have to lean back a

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.840 
but I actually even have to lean back a
little<00:01:20.440> bit<00:01:20.770> but<00:01:20.980> what<00:01:21.160> we're<00:01:21.280> trying<00:01:21.520> to<00:01:21.640> do

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
little bit but what we're trying to do

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.490 
little bit but what we're trying to do
you're<00:01:22.030> going<00:01:22.120> to<00:01:22.180> point<00:01:22.480> your<00:01:22.690> toe<00:01:22.930> you're

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
you're going to point your toe you're

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.860 
you're going to point your toe you're
going<00:01:23.650> to<00:01:23.710> lift<00:01:23.920> the<00:01:24.130> one<00:01:24.310> leg<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.750> you're

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
going to lift the one leg and you're

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.500 
going to lift the one leg and you're
going<00:01:25.960> to<00:01:26.020> trace<00:01:26.380> circles<00:01:27.240> but<00:01:28.240> are<00:01:28.390> only

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
going to trace circles but are only

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.810 
going to trace circles but are only
about<00:01:28.690> five<00:01:29.080> to<00:01:29.350> ten<00:01:29.560> centimeters<00:01:30.280> in

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
about five to ten centimeters in

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.450 
about five to ten centimeters in
diameter<00:01:31.660> and<00:01:32.410> you're<00:01:33.040> going<00:01:33.130> to<00:01:33.190> slowly

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
diameter and you're going to slowly

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.700 
diameter and you're going to slowly
slowly<00:01:34.180> trace<00:01:34.720> that<00:01:35.020> circle<00:01:37.050> five<00:01:38.050> times<00:01:38.440> in

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
slowly trace that circle five times in

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.280 
slowly trace that circle five times in
each<00:01:38.830> direction<00:01:38.890> or<00:01:39.610> the<00:01:40.180> required<00:01:40.870> number<00:01:41.020> of

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
each direction or the required number of

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.970 
each direction or the required number of
repetitions<00:01:41.500> in<00:01:42.040> each<00:01:42.220> direction<00:01:42.460> go<00:01:43.270> slowly

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:43.980 
repetitions in each direction go slowly

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.690 
repetitions in each direction go slowly
neatness<00:01:44.980> counts<00:01:46.290> it's<00:01:47.290> brutally<00:01:48.160> hard<00:01:48.400> and

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
neatness counts it's brutally hard and

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.520 
neatness counts it's brutally hard and
again<00:01:49.030> if<00:01:49.180> you<00:01:49.300> need<00:01:49.330> to<00:01:49.690> lean<00:01:49.960> back<00:01:50.230> a<00:01:50.290> little

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
again if you need to lean back a little

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.180 
again if you need to lean back a little
bit<00:01:50.920> point<00:01:51.760> your<00:01:51.970> toe<00:01:52.210> and<00:01:52.980> make<00:01:53.980> those

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
bit point your toe and make those

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:02.570 
bit point your toe and make those
circles

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.640
