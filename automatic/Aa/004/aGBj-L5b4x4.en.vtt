 annually wants to google there I go back to 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.100
 this event 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.350
 she brings all she has of novelty of 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.879
 technology for developers and 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.120

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:06.090
 technology market and it presented 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:08.729
 android emmit on google eu 2015 okay it 's 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.560
 a preview version that they presented there 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.380
 which is already available for the nexus 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.299
 unfortunately instil our world has 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.970
 still does not update the link five can 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.610
 update this version preview conversion 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.500
 there for developers is nothing 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.350
 defined is still android and goes 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:30.119
 get here for us 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:33.060
 in early 2016 there are some 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.000
 technologies is it will have a system 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.670
 of digital is not native will have a 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.759
 a small android update system 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.770
 which is a type of payment of 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.009
 account on your smartphone with only one 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:51.119
 better touch battery management 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.390
 probably the battery will last 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.070
 double that it lasts today in the device 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.329
 so someone with a lot of improvement there 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.100
 among others 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.100
 other good improvements 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.079
 the android m it will be updated 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.300
 promoter of being a generation the first 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.100
 good news guys is not so good 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.230
 what happens with being 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.310
 isaaa motorola is already providing 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:21.490
 a new direction is for devices that 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:25.600
 now in 2015 a good flight will leave the 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:27.040
 Third Generation G Engine Who I Believe 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.060
 that they will continue with moto x de 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.820
 Monday 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.640
 continues with max motor motor has left 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.580
 now then probably this 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:40.990
 second-generation device that is 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:44.260
 2014 and 2013 that is the gt engine 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:48.130
 first generation will not receive will not go 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:51.820
 probably receive android issues 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:55.630
 It was reported that the 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.210
 motorola motorola said he needed 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.860
 in Google's source code 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.900
 available for devices to 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.840
 you are receiving this update then 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.120
 probably as soon as they have this 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.160
 code sources will be able to give 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.430
 definition to id which devices 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.320
 will receive the update 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.560
 Unfortunately I believe that they are 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:21.040
 speculations of course that geo engine 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.930
 first generation should not receive this 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.230
 store update is sure to go 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.390
 receive now for this month still 5.1 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.970
 others here on the channel for you the new 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:35.350
 update and you should not receive the 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.520
 android and g motor only now in new 2000 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.440
 who will leave third generation 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.020
 likely to receive if it does not come from 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.900
 factory will receive this update there 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.160
 It can be very difficult to update, but it's 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.710
 It's very difficult, we'll only have this 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:51.010
 setting when the motorola will receive the 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:55.420
 source codes to make available to 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:57.700
