00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.220
 hello everyone here cameron for 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.170
 buying the collaboration 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.879
 so she for my first video I had 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.739
 want to make a video on 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:39.390
 how to get to space her 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.790
 shampoos know oily hair 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.830
 because at 49 for them and it's a 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.780
 big problem that are not able to 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.220
 they are as obligated to wash the 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.590
 hair almost every day at 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.150
 maximum or two days while me that 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.300
 can easily go up to four 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:57.480
 days in shampoo without that 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.970
 so the first one is that I 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.970
 could you give it that would be 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.850
 choose a shampoo that is worth being 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.830
 quite natural without paraben without being 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.170
 do people know nothing given 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.400
 to eat the winner of amiens it's this 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.940
 I use it for over a year 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.710
 now 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.780
 then honestly I really did a 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.760
 good difference I do not need to 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.590
 wash your hair as often but 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.520
 Obviously she realizes with 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.619
 several other factors including alternating 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.119
 shampoo I know it'll be 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.840
 strange because I just said of 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.820
 take a good shampoo but the yarn 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.979
 this feather to alternate shampoo 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.539
 example do it three washes with the 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.429
 good shampoo and then do a wash 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:44.729
 with a shampoo I have the hero 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:46.590
 the essence is really skin shampoo 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.450
 very upscale but I would say and 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.679
 that 's what I participate in and his 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.320
 more but it's for a shampoo 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:53.850
 natural it's for a shampoo I think 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.969
 not that it feels like you're all alone 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.470
 but I'm pretty once this 4 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.960
 so 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.030
 just changing on one point 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.380
 once in a while it will do 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.110
 that the paths do not get used to 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.060
 shampoos that we more regularly 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.550
 like that it's going to help a lot 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.620
 as well 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:18.150
 a last thing in iron that goes 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.130
 much help in the process of this 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.280
 passage of threshold shampoos and 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.050
 use of dry shampoo so you 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.900
 have heard a lot about 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.370
 other youtube to also and so the 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.650
 his and some champions and those who go 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.930
 help you to have an appearance of 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.540
 clean hair without it being very 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.010
 very clean so for those who 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.690
 start who want to think about 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.340
 shampoos for sure if the second 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.290
 day you I start to look dirty 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.400
 but at the same time a dry shampoo the 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.860
 game you have others because that's 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.110
 the two that I like and therefore the one 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.550
 of Baptist and that of very moved I 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.740
 find that they are two chan chan 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.180
 concept that works well in their 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.130
 childhood offered a little powder to 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.910
 inside your hair then the 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.640
 facts the big facts will disappear 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.140
 with with its century shampoos so that 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.230
 add one more day 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.570
 between your hair wash 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.360
 and here is children it's really all 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.900
 simple I think anyone can there 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.550
 arrive 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.620
 it's sure that everything depends on your 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.459
 hair type too if you have them 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.320
 very serious hair 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.260
 it may take some time before 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.459
 to arrive at the result you want 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.040
 to the final result 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.900
 but I tell you that I had 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.400
 the hair every two days I think that 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.080
 even the hair the next day I had 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.690
 no pressure I had him full 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.480
 now I can easily pass me 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.680
 did not have those holes in day and end 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.629
 the third day 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.420
 wash my hair so easily 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:45.370
 to be four days among other bad guys 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.689
 at the point and even sometimes 5 everything 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.519
 depending on what I'm going to do in 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:51.370
 the 7th day is thanks to the house 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.989
 poe but also washing them 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.549
 hair - often it will make you 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.670
 much stronger hair much more 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:04:00.400
 a lot more hydrated and all that 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.439
 so that prevents breakers and 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.359
 split ends pu all because 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:07.269
 in fact hair sebum is 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:10.269
 really it's really like the mask 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:12.340
 natural the best I know we have good 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:15.579
 evening unmask all my eyes nothing like this 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.060
 like to let nature do its 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:17.979
 job 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.150
 so here I hope I did and 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:19.870
 challenges we see each other in a 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.270
 next video 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.560
 I hope in not too long I know 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.110
 that it took a star in class a 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:31.169
 video on anger but I start wines 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:34.169
 ends and we send each other as soon as possible 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.169
 building
