 last week the brown river plant located in Cerqueira Caesar received the 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:13.660
 visit of foreign researchers interested in alternative technologies 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:19.450
 developed by the countries of the so-called seven-month 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.239
 county participated in the day of field interaction more information to 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:25.429
 spectators 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:29.479
 the director josÃ© meira accompanied the visitors in all dependencies of the 

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:33.460
 company is considered as a leader in the production of alternative 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.100
 of self-sustainability since all the electricity consumed in the firm is 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.630
 produced with waste 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.360
 of the materials used in the process for filling the alcohol and the 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.190
 sugar 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.540
 at the end of the tour he commented that the initiative came from researchers of the 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.090
 Finnish and Costa Rica, as well as a Brazilian 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.240
 interest in the production of energy from biomass 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.600
 there 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.000
 According to information from the press office, the company has accepted 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.190
 beginning of its activities in the development and acquisition of 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.130
 technology to produce energy so as to try to flow without attacking the environment

 besides the rational use of water with the technologies applied in the area is sought 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.020
 first of all, industrial efficiency combined with environmental awareness 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.800
 required

 with the report of the newspaper comarca 

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:33.249
 reaffirming that their flags are as well as the members of the delegation was 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:37.930
 know the technologies developed in the country for an adaptation to their 

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:40.929

 their land because of the lack of the necessary environment. 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.140
 for products which give rise to the intended energy 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.360
 however the technology can be applied in less favored areas 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.360
 edition for dance by the countries represented 

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:59.009
 it's right

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:25.229
 The brown river mill is rapidly in operation with all sectors 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:28.030
 working only in mid-2000
