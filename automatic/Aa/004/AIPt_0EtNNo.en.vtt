still there I know before I said 1.2 was

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.890 
still there I know before I said 1.2 was
my<00:03:17.079> bug<00:03:17.350> free<00:03:17.680> while<00:03:17.950> I<00:03:17.980> was<00:03:18.220> wrong<00:03:18.430> and<00:03:19.209> i

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
my bug free while I was wrong and i

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.660 
my bug free while I was wrong and i
quickly<00:03:20.200> changed<00:03:20.650> that<00:03:21.010> as<00:03:21.160> soon<00:03:21.280> as<00:03:21.430> I<00:03:21.489> found

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
quickly changed that as soon as I found

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.319 
quickly changed that as soon as I found
out<00:03:21.910> that<00:03:22.090> it<00:03:22.209> wasn't<00:03:22.420> and<00:03:22.829> so<00:03:23.829> yeah<00:03:24.670> the<00:03:25.060> liens

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
out that it wasn't and so yeah the liens

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.530 
out that it wasn't and so yeah the liens
I<00:03:26.040> don't<00:03:27.040> think<00:03:27.280> I<00:03:27.400> should<00:03:27.430> change<00:03:27.910> because<00:03:28.359> it

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
I don't think I should change because it

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.940 
I don't think I should change because it
would<00:03:28.660> make<00:03:28.750> more<00:03:28.989> sense<00:03:29.049> to<00:03:29.470> hold<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:29.799> lead

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
would make more sense to hold the lead

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.410 
would make more sense to hold the lead
in<00:03:30.100> your<00:03:30.250> right<00:03:30.400> hand<00:03:30.430> as<00:03:30.850> you're<00:03:30.970> doing<00:03:31.120> stuff
