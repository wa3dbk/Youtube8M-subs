00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:38.460 
going to line up to the top of the loop
with<00:03:32.890> the<00:03:33.040> end<00:03:33.220> of<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:33.520> fed<00:03:33.700> up<00:03:33.880> and<00:03:35.940> I'm<00:03:37.470> gonna

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
with the end of the fed up and I'm gonna

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:49.520 
with the end of the fed up and I'm gonna
start<00:03:38.860> wrapping<00:03:43.440> cut<00:03:44.440> off<00:03:45.000> excess<00:03:47.760> and<00:03:48.760> then

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
start wrapping cut off excess and then

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.050 
start wrapping cut off excess and then
unit<00:03:50.530> with<00:03:50.800> the<00:03:50.980> channels

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.940 

x<00:03:55.060> so<00:03:56.020> now<00:03:56.170> we<00:03:56.800> have<00:03:57.540> most<00:03:58.540> of<00:03:58.870> the<00:03:59.020> earring<00:03:59.380> and

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
x so now we have most of the earring and

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.130 
x so now we have most of the earring and
now<00:04:00.130> we're<00:04:00.310> going<00:04:00.460> to<00:04:00.550> make<00:04:00.700> a<00:04:01.000> hook<00:04:01.360> for<00:04:01.690> the

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
now we're going to make a hook for the

feeling<00:04:16.090> around<00:04:16.750> new<00:04:17.290> styles<00:04:18.120> take<00:04:19.120> the<00:04:19.299> tips

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
feeling around new styles take the tips

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:29.150 
feeling around new styles take the tips
and<00:04:21.910> make<00:04:22.120> a<00:04:22.330> small<00:04:25.560> then<00:04:27.180> taking<00:04:28.180> any<00:04:28.360> grown

cylindrical object like this maybe
you're<00:04:32.860> going<00:04:33.100> to<00:04:33.540> bend<00:04:34.540> the<00:04:34.720> wire<00:04:34.930> around<00:04:35.230> it

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.890 

so<00:04:39.280> that<00:04:39.460> it<00:04:39.640> forms<00:04:40.030> a<00:04:40.360> kind<00:04:40.660> of<00:04:40.930> hook<00:04:41.230> shape<00:04:41.590> i

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
so that it forms a kind of hook shape i

the<00:04:47.530> end<00:04:47.740> slightly<00:04:48.690> and<00:04:49.690> then<00:04:49.720> cut<00:04:50.320> off<00:04:50.350> the

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
the end slightly and then cut off the

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:56.990 
the end slightly and then cut off the
excess<00:04:51.100> and<00:04:51.630> taking<00:04:52.630> some<00:04:52.780> coarse<00:04:53.080> sandpaper

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.559 

file<00:04:58.110> the<00:04:59.110> rough<00:04:59.290> edges<00:04:59.530> off

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:01.569 
file the rough edges off

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:03.179 
file the rough edges off
and<00:05:01.929> then<00:05:02.050> I'm<00:05:02.199> a<00:05:02.319> smoother<00:05:02.770> piece<00:05:03.009> of

00:05:03.179 --> 00:05:03.189 
and then I'm a smoother piece of

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:05.309 
and then I'm a smoother piece of
sandpaper<00:05:03.599> I'm<00:05:04.599> just<00:05:04.809> going<00:05:04.960> to<00:05:05.050> smooth<00:05:05.289> it

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:05.319

you're finish wrapping using the side
cutter<00:05:54.580> clip<00:05:56.410> now<00:05:57.410> I<00:05:57.440> get<00:05:57.650> the<00:05:57.770> ring<00:05:57.950> this<00:05:58.550> is

00:05:58.690 --> 00:05:58.700 
cutter clip now I get the ring this is

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.800 
cutter clip now I get the ring this is
called<00:05:58.910> a<00:05:59.060> jump<00:05:59.300> ring<00:06:00.550> so<00:06:01.550> what<00:06:01.700> you<00:06:01.790> do<00:06:01.940> the

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
called a jump ring so what you do the

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.520 
called a jump ring so what you do the
open<00:06:03.170> a<00:06:03.230> jump<00:06:03.410> ring<00:06:03.620> use<00:06:04.550> two<00:06:04.790> piles<00:06:05.090> and<00:06:05.530> open

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:06.530 
open a jump ring use two piles and open

open a jump ring use two piles and open
the<00:06:06.650> other<00:06:06.710> side<00:06:09.190> then<00:06:11.890> let's<00:06:12.890> take<00:06:13.070> a<00:06:13.100> jump

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
the other side then let's take a jump

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.490 
the other side then let's take a jump
ring<00:06:13.580> through<00:06:13.910> the<00:06:14.000> loop<00:06:14.180> and<00:06:14.960> then<00:06:15.140> we<00:06:15.260> stick

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:15.500 
ring through the loop and then we stick

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:26.129 
ring through the loop and then we stick
the<00:06:15.650> hook<00:06:15.770> on<00:06:17.530> and<00:06:18.610> then<00:06:19.610> close
