 the superbike class for the premier class 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.130
 which confirmed what we had 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.790
 saw yesterday precisely in the third round with 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.400
 an amazing matteo baiocco really a 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.049
 the tires that rattled were hot 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.460
 but matteo was fantastic 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.900
 yes matteo as in Saturday's race is 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.040
 was very fast the way has sought 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.930
 immediately to escape but this time 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.180
 found in alex polita a worthy 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.320
 opponent the pirate tried to 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.570
 a few laps but then it slipped 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.549
 leaving free road to baiocco that 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.720

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.270
 fabrizio perotti surprise again here 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.610
 a vallelunga baiocco very fast state 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.670
 author of the new track record in 1 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.720
 36 581 an incredible time because the 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.310
 previous record belonged a 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.950
 real superbike while these are 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.630
 stock with slick tires and now 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.940
 we hear from the words of Matteo 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.619
 baiocco, the winner of the class 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.619
 superbike fourth rank a vallelunga 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.590
 maximum boys 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.000
 I thank Pirelli for being a beautiful girl 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.820
 nice redemption for us we had not tried 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.130
 long does not mean anything 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.020
 for now we are happy and in the class 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.940
 the superbike is the queen me 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.670
 giulio a little defined as the princess 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.220
 instead of the 2014 cim the new super sport 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.410
 a very successful formula that has seen 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.170
 many pilots a record even 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.880
 in qualifying 21 in a second 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.860
 and then the race unpredictable from the first 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.620
 on the last lap, even predictable cigars 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.620
 that of Sunday vallelunga race 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.390
 that went to the Florentine jam 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.800
 unfortunate protagonist we say in v 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.390
 in season at mugello he managed to 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.920
 beat diego giuglar winner of the 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.890
 Saturday race I say he is a new leader 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.390
 the old man is a little bit of the championship 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.940
 let's say the class class 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.500
 supersport he 42 years old and comes to his senses 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.690
 put back into play this year in the 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.700
 tricolor is going very strong and the 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.010
 its value is also recognized east 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.700
 also recognized by dying nochetto 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.920
 thanks to him my statement 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.739
 that Sunday fact is worth more 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.500
 third place for gennaro sabatino who is 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.820
 arrived under the checkered flag with 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.040
 then average histories of yellow flags 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.440
 its its position is a bit even 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.510
 on the judge we hear from the 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.010
 words of nicola j morrentino la 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.790
 happiness at the end of the race of 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.930
 supersport 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.510
 yes yes because I do n't see anything today 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.819
 I wanted to leave but almost arrived 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.560
 again when never exceeded 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.540
 we dropped a good pace and wanted to 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.069
 I didn't want to get those back then 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.959
 I started looking again 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.569
 to push the last few more 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.890
 let's say that I have this race 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.349
 won yesterday because I solved all 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.519
 problems that I found in the race 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.099
 dedicates the whole team 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:01.079
 this great victory finally the class 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.909
 pre moto3 the one dedicated to 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.469
 very young to those who tomorrow 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:07.560
 they will jump into the moto3 and then 

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:09.450
 who knows maybe even in the world a pre 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.879
 moto3 also in this case really 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.489
 bubbling both in the two times and 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:15.389
 in the 4 times that say julio really 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.389
 I do not find the words 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:20.130
 in the race really hard to do 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.870
 of predictions because the race was 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.669
 won by Tony Arbolino who found himself 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.370
 road more level on the last corner 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.620
 when ieraci and fugitive form are 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.940
 they are accounts right at the last corner 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.740
 of the last round arbolino won the 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.800
 race repeating the success of the race of 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.410
 Saturday in front of vietti ramus and zannoni 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.210
 in the 4 times before because arbolino 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.500
