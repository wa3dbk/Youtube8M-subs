00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
sol big quantity of copper of Koskov is

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.300 
sol big quantity of copper of Koskov is
natural<00:01:08.210> but<00:01:08.750> if<00:01:08.960> you<00:01:09.140> use<00:01:09.350> a<00:01:09.560> big<00:01:09.830> quantity

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
to Eric how even if I'd and normally

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.870 
to Eric how even if I'd and normally
with<00:02:43.030> that<00:02:43.269> style<00:02:43.600> of<00:02:43.810> unification<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:45.670> one

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
with that style of unification the one

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.319 
with that style of unification the one
should<00:02:46.480> be<00:02:46.540> very<00:02:47.109> hard<00:02:47.500> and<00:02:47.799> when<00:02:48.700> elevated

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
should be very hard and when elevated

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.370 
should be very hard and when elevated
the<00:02:49.450> wine<00:02:49.630> is<00:02:50.160> so<00:02:51.160> bad

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
the wine is so bad

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.370 
the wine is so bad
so<00:02:52.980> he<00:02:53.070> came<00:02:53.250> back<00:02:53.490> and<00:02:53.760> say<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.090> don't<00:02:54.570> and<00:02:54.750> I

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
so he came back and say I don't and I

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.660 
so he came back and say I don't and I
don't<00:02:55.500> know<00:02:55.860> what's<00:02:56.040> happened<00:02:56.490> with<00:02:56.610> that

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
don't know what's happened with that

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.350 
don't know what's happened with that
guilt<00:02:57.090> any<00:02:57.390> but<00:02:57.660> I<00:02:57.960> think<00:02:58.890> it's<00:02:59.520> very<00:02:59.880> very

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
guilt any but I think it's very very

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.090 
guilt any but I think it's very very
important<00:03:01.400> so<00:03:02.400> we<00:03:02.580> started<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.120> find<00:03:03.390> some

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100

that book it's very dense so how to use
that<00:03:16.980> for<00:03:17.880> your<00:03:18.000> practice<00:03:18.500> difficult<00:03:19.500> we

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
that for your practice difficult we

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.240 
that for your practice difficult we
tried<00:03:20.760> but<00:03:20.790> it<00:03:21.480> was<00:03:21.510> for<00:03:21.930> vegetables<00:03:22.650> it<00:03:22.920> was

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
tried but it was for vegetables it was

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.780 
tried but it was for vegetables it was
from<00:03:23.460> a<00:03:23.490> tree<00:03:24.210> fruit<00:03:24.630> trees<00:03:25.160> but<00:03:26.160> not<00:03:26.460> a<00:03:26.490> lot<00:03:26.640> of

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
from a tree fruit trees but not a lot of

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.810 
from a tree fruit trees but not a lot of
things<00:03:27.180> about<00:03:27.330> fine<00:03:27.780> so<00:03:28.050> how<00:03:28.260> to<00:03:28.320> start<00:03:28.770> but<00:03:29.670> we

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
things about fine so how to start but we

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.910 
things about fine so how to start but we
were<00:03:29.940> convinced<00:03:30.300> that<00:03:30.720> we<00:03:31.080> could<00:03:31.320> we<00:03:31.650> must

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
were convinced that we could we must

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.250 
were convinced that we could we must
work<00:03:32.340> with<00:03:32.730> that<00:03:32.880> concept<00:03:33.270> but<00:03:34.170> not<00:03:34.470> just<00:03:34.950> with

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
work with that concept but not just with

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.320 
work with that concept but not just with
just<00:03:37.260> like<00:03:37.410> that<00:03:37.560> we<00:03:37.740> wanted<00:03:38.010> to<00:03:38.070> have<00:03:38.330> good

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
just like that we wanted to have good

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.680 
just like that we wanted to have good
things<00:03:39.660> to<00:03:39.750> start<00:03:41.000> because<00:03:42.000> we<00:03:42.150> have<00:03:42.270> our<00:03:42.300> herd

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
things to start because we have our herd

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.780 
things to start because we have our herd
are<00:03:43.050> fitting<00:03:43.440> India's<00:03:44.040> so<00:03:44.430> it's<00:03:44.670> very

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
are fitting India's so it's very

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:52.280 
are fitting India's so it's very
important

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290
