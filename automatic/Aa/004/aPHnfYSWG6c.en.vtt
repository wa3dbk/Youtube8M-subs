00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
had with that if your windshield wasn't

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.869 
had with that if your windshield wasn't
transparent<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:44.280> couldn't<00:00:44.640> see<00:00:44.730> where

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
transparent you couldn't see where

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.430 
transparent you couldn't see where
you're<00:00:45.030> going<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.899> camera<00:00:46.200> clips

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
you're going and the camera clips

you're going and the camera clips
through<00:00:46.590> motorcycles<00:00:47.629> so<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.690> can<00:00:48.840> also<00:00:48.989> use

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
through motorcycles so you can also use

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.540 
through motorcycles so you can also use
a<00:00:49.289> gun<00:00:49.559> while<00:00:49.739> driving<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.250> first-person

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
a gun while driving in first-person

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.189 
a gun while driving in first-person
which<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.090> pretty<00:00:51.270> funny<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.719> it<00:00:51.809> works<00:00:51.989> well

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
which is pretty funny and it works well

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.350 
which is pretty funny and it works well
too<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:53.190> only<00:00:53.250> downside<00:00:53.850> being<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.239> your

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
too the only downside being that your

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.729 
too the only downside being that your
character<00:00:54.690> doesn't<00:00:54.899> hold<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.260> wheel<00:00:55.410> quite

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
character doesn't hold the wheel quite

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.110 
character doesn't hold the wheel quite
right<00:00:56.010> when<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.280> have<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.520> gun<00:00:56.789> out<00:00:56.940> and

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
right when you have a gun out and

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.520 
right when you have a gun out and
sometimes<00:00:57.750> they<00:00:57.899> don't<00:00:58.020> have<00:00:58.199> their<00:00:58.379> gun

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
sometimes they don't have their gun

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.250 
sometimes they don't have their gun
pointed<00:00:58.949> at<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.160> right<00:00:59.340> spot<00:00:59.640> I<00:01:00.109> put<00:01:01.109> on<00:01:01.230> a

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
pointed at the right spot I put on a

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.810 
pointed at the right spot I put on a
couple<00:01:01.469> costumes<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.160> make<00:01:02.190> sure<00:01:02.460> everything

couple costumes to make sure everything

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.250
