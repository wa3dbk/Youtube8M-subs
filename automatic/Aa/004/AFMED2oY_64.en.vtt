00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
a theory about okay you can ask me about

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.200 
a theory about okay you can ask me about
if<00:01:44.310> you're<00:01:44.460> going<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.700> get<00:01:44.790> really<00:01:45.000> bored

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
double specific so there will be some

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.120 
double specific so there will be some
kind<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:51.090> central<00:01:51.600> theme<00:01:51.810> okay<00:01:52.470> cool<00:01:52.799> well

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
kind of central theme okay cool well

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.510 
kind of central theme okay cool well
what's<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.060> like<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.049> kind<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.710> 2.5<00:01:56.280> d

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
what's it like to it is a kind of 2.5 d

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.940 
what's it like to it is a kind of 2.5 d
side<00:01:57.060> scroller<00:01:57.570> looks<00:01:57.869> very<00:01:58.259> fast<00:01:58.530> actually

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
side scroller looks very fast actually

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.209 
side scroller looks very fast actually
from<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.250> gameplay<00:01:59.579> yeah<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:01.259> well<00:02:01.890> there

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
from the gameplay yeah and so well there

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.560 
from the gameplay yeah and so well there
are<00:02:02.310> some<00:02:02.399> levels<00:02:02.700> which<00:02:02.820> are<00:02:02.880> fast<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.329> which

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
are some levels which are fast and which

which by the way is incredible in one of
my<00:03:29.580> favorite<00:03:29.850> self<00:03:30.030> games<00:03:30.239> so<00:03:30.510> it<00:03:30.630> is<00:03:30.750> also<00:03:30.870> a

they were working on a prince of persia
prototype<00:05:13.110> that<00:05:13.139> came<00:05:13.440> out<00:05:13.590> right<00:05:13.740> steps<00:05:14.160> well

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
prototype that came out right steps well

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.409 
prototype that came out right steps well
you<00:05:14.580> look<00:05:14.760> like<00:05:14.789> that's<00:05:15.000> here<00:05:15.210> so<00:05:15.389> a

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
you look like that's here so a

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.659 
you look like that's here so a
side-scrolling<00:05:16.320> mmm<00:05:17.010> looked<00:05:17.370> remarkably

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:17.669 
side-scrolling mmm looked remarkably

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:20.810 
side-scrolling mmm looked remarkably
similar<00:05:18.660> to<00:05:18.930> the<00:05:19.199> web<00:05:19.350> home<00:05:20.160> said<00:05:20.370> this<00:05:20.580> would

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
similar to the web home said this would

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.360 
similar to the web home said this would
you<00:05:20.940> say<00:05:21.090> that<00:05:21.120> maybe<00:05:21.600> is<00:05:21.870> it<00:05:22.169> is<00:05:22.740> what<00:05:22.979> well

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
you say that maybe is it is what well

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.159 
you say that maybe is it is what well
licensed<00:05:23.820> preclinical<00:05:24.120> is<00:05:24.450> coming<00:05:24.720> possibly

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
licensed preclinical is coming possibly

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:27.290 
licensed preclinical is coming possibly
confirm<00:05:25.590> with<00:05:25.800> the<00:05:25.830> night<00:05:26.099> from<00:05:26.910> they

published<00:05:27.690> these<00:05:27.810> screenshots<00:05:28.139> on<00:05:28.410> their

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
published these screenshots on their

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.909 
published these screenshots on their
site<00:05:28.770> right<00:05:29.099> and<00:05:30.169> it<00:05:31.169> looked<00:05:31.380> a<00:05:31.530> lot<00:05:31.710> like<00:05:31.770> a

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
site right and it looked a lot like a

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:33.140 
site right and it looked a lot like a
prince<00:05:32.130> of<00:05:32.190> persia<00:05:32.340> game<00:05:32.610> they<00:05:32.760> didn't<00:05:33.000> say

going on from what i've seen like it

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:00.560 
going on from what i've seen like it
handles<00:05:58.830> that<00:05:58.949> quite<00:05:59.430> nicely<00:05:59.669> actually<00:06:00.210> just

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 
handles that quite nicely actually just

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.439 
handles that quite nicely actually just
having<00:06:00.780> vision<00:06:01.020> guns<00:06:01.199> on<00:06:01.500> a<00:06:02.120> kind<00:06:03.120> of<00:06:03.210> 2d

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:03.449 
having vision guns on a kind of 2d

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
side-scroller having the way that such

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.550 
side-scroller having the way that such
as<00:06:05.550> crew<00:06:05.760> yaps<00:06:06.150> as<00:06:06.479> well<00:06:06.660> because<00:06:07.020> it's<00:06:07.320> God's

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
as crew yaps as well because it's God's

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.409 
as crew yaps as well because it's God's
I<00:06:07.800> mean<00:06:08.130> you<00:06:08.520> know<00:06:08.610> understand<00:06:08.910> what<00:06:09.030> this<00:06:09.120> how

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:09.419 
I mean you know understand what this how

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:10.909 
I mean you know understand what this how
the<00:06:09.479> system<00:06:09.870> works<00:06:10.050> rather<00:06:10.470> than<00:06:10.650> kind<00:06:10.800> of

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919 
the system works rather than kind of

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:13.279 
the system works rather than kind of
yeah<00:06:11.099> second<00:06:11.610> guess<00:06:11.729> it<00:06:11.760> yeah<00:06:12.150> at<00:06:12.840> least<00:06:12.990> you

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:13.289 
yeah second guess it yeah at least you

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:14.960 
yeah second guess it yeah at least you
know<00:06:13.440> it's<00:06:13.740> not<00:06:13.860> always<00:06:14.070> realistic<00:06:14.580> because

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:14.970 
know it's not always realistic because

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.390 
know it's not always realistic because
you<00:06:15.960> can<00:06:16.169> sort<00:06:16.380> of<00:06:16.470> cheat<00:06:16.650> the<00:06:16.740> system<00:06:16.860> by<00:06:17.099> just

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 
you can sort of cheat the system by just

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.950 
you can sort of cheat the system by just
staying<00:06:17.610> out<00:06:17.820> of<00:06:17.880> range<00:06:18.150> in<00:06:18.300> the<00:06:18.449> code<00:06:18.690> even

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 
staying out of range in the code even

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.450 
staying out of range in the code even
though<00:06:19.169> the<00:06:19.289> guard<00:06:19.470> is<00:06:19.590> right<00:06:19.740> behind<00:06:19.860> you<00:06:20.220> and

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 
though the guard is right behind you and

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.150 
though the guard is right behind you and
it's<00:06:21.240> you<00:06:21.479> know<00:06:21.510> along<00:06:22.110> yeah<00:06:22.470> energy<00:06:22.860> corridor

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:23.160 
it's you know along yeah energy corridor

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.710 
it's you know along yeah energy corridor
at<00:06:23.490> least<00:06:23.669> you<00:06:23.789> know<00:06:24.000> that<00:06:24.270> you're<00:06:24.360> safe<00:06:24.539> and

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 
at least you know that you're safe and

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.230 
at least you know that you're safe and
it<00:06:24.840> feels<00:06:25.080> you<00:06:25.830> are<00:06:25.860> caught<00:06:26.250> like<00:06:26.550> well<00:06:27.060> I<00:06:27.090> know

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 
it feels you are caught like well I know

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.750 
it feels you are caught like well I know
I've<00:06:27.630> yet<00:06:27.960> but<00:06:28.200> he's<00:06:28.289> fearful<00:06:28.770> but<00:06:29.159> in<00:06:29.430> earlier

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:29.760 
I've yet but he's fearful but in earlier

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.380 
I've yet but he's fearful but in earlier
