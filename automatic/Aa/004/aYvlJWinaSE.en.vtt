 euros 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.009
 fans of the articles are definitely not welcome in leeuwarden for the 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.609
 away match against cambuur tonight this has the judge thursday afternoon 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.829
 decided after the sports associations and did summary proceedings 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:28.009
 but his english club proposes one 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.009
 prove that it has taken 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.769
 we think it is a failing policy 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:37.769
 Municipality of Leeuwarden about public order 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.200
 a little bit was we fear that in fact white is mostly a lot wrong 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.500
 in the Netherlands for a collision and 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.500
 impose a ban on visiting club 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.590
 yeah right click assen a sportsman I find it annoying for our athletes 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.550
 but 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.090
 the other hand it can imagine the worries that such a bridge master year 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.220
 made at such a loaded competition 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.530
 paid a month ago for the fans from deventer after the home game against 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.140
 cambuur divisions is cleared 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.830
 mayor ferd crone 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.030
 has declared the entire municipality the safety risk area he expects 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.120
 despite the prohibition that has been converted from tarin kowt to milan, I am not normal 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.110
 10 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.310
 we hope that our supporters that common sense 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.700
 use and 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.890
 the court ruling is wrong 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.330
 do you think that will influence your neelie not encouraged 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.500
 goods 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.490
 yes but that amount according to connoisseurs to be in a course of course it is 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.850
 very annoying because 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.470
 yes so an exciting game maybe i'm going from one 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.860
 and then the support of the sport is always welcome we sit down how much the support and 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.410
 and the and high 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.280
 how could in plain text also who in the stadium especially at our home and that is 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.510
 certainly annoying the game sc cambuur cardinals is friday night at half past seven 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.210
 directly on rtl7 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.360
 and for that it will be tonight 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.860
 but i think i just have nothing to make right in that sense of 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.199
 it still kind of feels like we are here at home 

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:12.429
 had earned more 

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:16.329
 so yes and no claim to the result but 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:20.119
 one thing is for sure we just don't want to get back let us know he's leaving
