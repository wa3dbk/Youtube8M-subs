00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.439
Glenn: Hi, everybody, I'm Glenn May, and I'm
here with Bill Dance.

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:07.560
Bill we're going to be here in Kentucky Lake,
in early April, how would you fish it, to

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.620
catch more bass?

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.740
Bill: Well, April is, it really depends on
our winter.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.830
If we have an early winter, April can be a
sensational time.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.909
Our nighttime temperatures will govern, what
happens in early April.

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:23.890
If we have cold nights, it's going to be a
little bit later.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.080
Normally the first week of April, in that
part of the country is an ideal time.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.419
What I would look for is, the warmest water.

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.430
If we have a lot of rain, and they're moving
a lot of water through the TVA system, I'm

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.750
going to look for murky water.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.399
Because murky water, or off colored water,
is going to warm much quicker then the clear

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:44.510
water.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:51.769
I'm going to probably look for the protected
areas; they're going to warm much quicker,

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:55.670
the backend of coves, the backend of creeks.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.510
You could find at that time of year, some
vegetation starting to sprout up.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.590
Again, it depends on the water temperature,
if the water is up, the water is back in the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.790
butt brush, spinnerbaits could be a good choice.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.050
Jigs with plastic attractors, could be a good
choice, but look for the warmest areas, that's

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.060
going to be the key.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.100
And two or three degrees can make a major
difference.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.520
The main lake again, depending on the water
temperature, but the pockets, the coves, off

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.240
of the main lake, will normally produce the
most active fish.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.591
Glenn: Now we're going to be fishing out of
Kenlake State Park, does anybody have to make

00:01:36.591 --> 00:01:38.760
a real long run, to get to the bass?

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.030
Bill: Well, you've got coves, and runs, all
up and down the lake.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.600
I have gone as far as Barkley.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.390
Make that run, go through the Land Between
The Lakes, and over into Barkley, and find

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.390
fish.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:58.860
Even in late March, early April, mid April,
and still find those fish, in the flooded

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.670
flats, if the water is up.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.040
Now we could get a lot of rain, at that time
of year, it could push water way back in the

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.040
flats.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.450
And these fish will move back in there.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.440
I've caught a lot of fish, on plastic lizards,
throwing a real light slip sinker, at that

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.440
time of the year.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.390
A slow presentation type bait, again, it depends
on what Mother Nature, dishes out.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.870
If she dishes out cold nights, cold nights
dictate.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.470
We have more cooling hours at that time of
the year, then we do warming hours.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.020
You know, people say, well tomorrow it's going
up to 70 degrees.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.860
Well, that 70 degrees normally, doesn't get
here until around two, three or four o'clock,

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.710
and by five o'clock, it's starting to cool
down again.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:50.780
And we have a lot of dark hours, so it's the
nighttime temperatures that really govern

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:51.780
the daytime temperatures.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.680
And cold water is heavier, then warm water.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.340
It's thicker, it's denser, and it falls right
through.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.650
So what the afternoon temperatures warmed
up, the nighttime temperatures chill right

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:03.709
back down.

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.490
And a bass, being a cold-blooded creature,
his or her body temperature is the same, as

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.240
the surrounding water.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.170
So they move in, they try it, they move out.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.209
They move in, and they move out.

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:22.540
Even with temperature changes where you find,
what I call good housekeeping banks, good

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.750
areas.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.690
If you've located fish, and you find good
areas like that and you get changes like that

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.920
in the water temperature, many times those
fish will just move out just a little bit.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.040
So just back out a little bit, and fish slower.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:43.319
Slower presentation type baits, like lighter
weight jigs, with plastic combinations, plastic

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:44.550
lizards.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.520
Lizards, don't live in water I don't know
why, they call them lizards, but salamander

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.200
type baits, with light slip sinkers.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.370
Light slip sinkers, give the bait a much,
slower fall.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.430
Glenn: What would be your favorite color choices?

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:04.640
Bill: I like darker baits, because they hold
their identity, so much better that's just,

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.640
personal choice.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.640
Glenn: Exactly.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.380
Bill: But, April is a great time, on Kentucky
Lake, and it's a tremendous reservoir.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.220
Our fishery there has come back so strong
in the last few years.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.400
And we have a great small mouth population
there too.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.430
We welcome you there, and I think you're going
to have a great time.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.389
And it's the type of place if you fish it
once, you'll want to come back again.

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:27.409
Glenn: All right.

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:28.409
Well thank you so much Bill.

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:29.409
. .

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:30.409
Bill: Thank you, Buddy.

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:31.409
Glenn: I appreciate your time.

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.412
Bill: Thank you.
