00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:08.129
 I have a series of prints and people 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:11.099
 choose and choose the color you want the 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:12.610
 stamp that you want and based on that in your 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.860
 work 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:19.779
 how these works are made 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:23.680
 figures we do not have if they are figures or 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:27.620
 be leaves flowers animal prints that 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:30.110
 they are already and I work on that 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.480
 people can choose something in 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.270
 particular for example to give yes 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.340
 yes out there they ask me for something else that 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.440
 I do not have and I put together a picture is 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.550
 the show I show you in different 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.710
 colors and if you like I do it 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.830
 find the movement people are 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.230
 about if in general I work via 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:54.020
 facebook and if I do not have a catalog 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.510
 printed but mostly sold by 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.579
 Facebook 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.140
 and the person who wants to access this 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.300
 can they go to your house to communicate 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.280
 by facebook if by facebook or 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.610
 call me on the phone because in my house 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.440
 I do not have a fixed schedule 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.220
 are the costs that roughly 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.900
 they are handling the thermos are in 280 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.290
 weights and then I make cans 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:20.070
 custom matt and the cans are 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.190
 in an 80 90 depends on the size the mates 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.920
 there's an 80 90 now I'm doing 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:29.400
 promotions so they are a bit more 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.320
 cheap or the idea came up to do this 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.840
 kind of things 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.200

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.570

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.560

 continue with the work I surrendered and good 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.910
