00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.809
 is the only manufacturer for 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.059
 forklift employing a hybrid 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.580
 So a diesel-electric drive 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:16.460
 Recently, two models of the Rx 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.110
 70 series equipped with supercups that 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.480
 three tons and a half tons 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.460
 the supercups save the 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.410
 energy released during braking 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.660
 Will and will give you speed 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.279
 back to the drive motor from this 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.910
 technology should make the stacker more economical 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.880
 do 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.160
 we did the test compared to the rx 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.870
 70 we have already tested 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.620
 The hybrid stacker is a bit bigger and bigger 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.750
 severe 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.640
 instead of two and a half tons, the test raises 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.010
 Stapler now three tons that 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.320
 Total weight is higher and our test 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.540
 weight was heavier 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.100
 the difference was 750 in total 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.810
 kilo 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.300
 despite the higher weight, he is silent 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:56.630
 a relatively small diesel engine 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.130
 three ton has the same 30 kw vw motor 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.170
 like his easier brother 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.910
 this is possible because of the super caps 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.540
 the one 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.130
 deliver additional power of 8 kw 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.810
 except for a few small details 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.880
 this stacker is identical to his 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.220
 predecessor who is up and down 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.070
 spacious legroom in the footwell 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.020
 more than generous the vehicle is 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.390
 neatly processed another 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.850
 The new RX 70 series is new 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.770
 position of the instruments they were from 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.080
 the side to the front of the cabin 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.300
 this keeps the display well 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.270
 visible even when sitting over one 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.640
 Armrest has the power of the rx 70 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.160
 30 hybrid is very satisfied 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.410
 reached both with and without load 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.550
 we have a speed of 21 4 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.680
 hours kilometers 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.990
 that's more than average 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.060
 high speed with lars is something 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.039
 below the average but is for one 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.930
 brisk working pace more than 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.000
 sufficient during the power measurement 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.149
 this three ton comes to a value 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.890
 of 333 pallets in eight hours that 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.170
 is close to the average value 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.840
 of the previously tested two and a half tons 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.780
 staplers in the energy measurement was the 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.429
 Consumption almost at the rx 70 in 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.700
 the two and a half ton version without 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:11.110
 supercups this was at 32 2 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.990
 liters per hour 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.880
 but now we are transporting 750 kilos 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.220
 more and have the energy saving program 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.650
 off with blog takes the 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.830
 productivity barely off but drops the 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.880
 Consumption to 3 0 7 liters 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.080
 Conclusion already 670 was in our test 2007 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.240
 very economical 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.920
 However, the use of the super cups leads 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.170
 in a new dimension 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.790
 the additional 8 kw electrical 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.890
 make yourself in the power 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.020
 acceleration clearly noticeable the 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.010
 accumulated braking energy can be optimal 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.170
 be used 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.270
 this reduces energy consumption in the 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.250
 intralogistics the detailed 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.410
 test report on the silent rx 70 hybrid 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.140
 you will find in the october edition of the 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.390
 Total logistics from october 2012 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.260
 on the homepage you will find the pdfs
