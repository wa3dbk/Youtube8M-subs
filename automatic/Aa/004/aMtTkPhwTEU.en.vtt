that extra bullet I need that extra off
to<00:02:49.849> actually<00:02:50.239> um<00:02:50.540> you<00:02:50.569> know<00:02:50.870> kill<00:02:51.139> that<00:02:51.319> guy

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:51.439 
to actually um you know kill that guy

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:53.740 
to actually um you know kill that guy
and<00:02:51.680> that's<00:02:52.129> why<00:02:52.250> it<00:02:52.310> doesn't<00:02:52.519> fire<00:02:52.970> you<00:02:53.629> know

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
and that's why it doesn't fire you know

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:54.970 
and that's why it doesn't fire you know
see<00:02:53.959> those<00:02:54.109> guys<00:02:54.290> right<00:02:54.409> over<00:02:54.680> there<00:02:54.829> they

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
see those guys right over there they

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.309 
see those guys right over there they
would<00:02:55.099> have<00:02:55.129> killed<00:02:55.310> me<00:02:55.459> easily<00:02:55.849> and<00:02:56.810> I

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
would have killed me easily and I

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.020 
would have killed me easily and I
believe<00:02:57.950> they<00:02:58.099> had<00:02:58.250> a<00:02:58.280> salt<00:02:58.549> rifles<00:02:58.849> in<00:02:58.939> their

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
believe they had a salt rifles in their

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.819 
believe they had a salt rifles in their
hands<00:02:59.180> or<00:02:59.329> at<00:02:59.450> least<00:02:59.719> light<00:02:59.959> machineguns<00:03:00.469> so

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
hands or at least light machineguns so

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:02.379 
hands or at least light machineguns so
that's<00:03:01.010> why<00:03:01.099> they<00:03:01.219> would<00:03:01.760> have<00:03:01.879> won<00:03:02.030> that<00:03:02.209> gun

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:02.389 
that's why they would have won that gun

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:06.670 
that's why they would have won that gun
fight<00:03:02.569> now<00:03:03.379> I<00:03:04.090> know<00:03:05.090> a<00:03:05.239> lot<00:03:05.540> of<00:03:05.689> guys<00:03:05.870> think

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
fight now I know a lot of guys think

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.679 
fight now I know a lot of guys think
that<00:03:06.889> the<00:03:07.010> you<00:03:07.310> SAS<00:03:07.549> might<00:03:07.730> be<00:03:07.849> overpowered<00:03:08.569> as

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:08.689 
that the you SAS might be overpowered as

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:10.539 
that the you SAS might be overpowered as
well<00:03:08.900> but<00:03:09.500> it's<00:03:09.650> definitely<00:03:09.859> not<00:03:10.099> armed

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
well but it's definitely not armed

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.429 
well but it's definitely not armed
because<00:03:10.849> of<00:03:11.090> the<00:03:11.150> fact<00:03:11.389> it<00:03:11.900> does<00:03:12.169> have<00:03:12.409> a

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:12.439 
because of the fact it does have a

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:14.500 
because of the fact it does have a
really<00:03:12.829> sometimes<00:03:13.459> you<00:03:13.639> get<00:03:13.849> lucky<00:03:14.120> you'll

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
really sometimes you get lucky you'll

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.629 
really sometimes you get lucky you'll
get<00:03:14.659> those<00:03:14.810> shots<00:03:15.049> that<00:03:15.260> go<00:03:15.980> really<00:03:16.280> far<00:03:16.489> and

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:16.639 
get those shots that go really far and
