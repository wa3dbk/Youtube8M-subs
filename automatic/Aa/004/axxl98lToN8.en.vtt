00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.439 

checking<00:00:00.750> fuel<00:00:01.050> pressure<00:00:01.319> on<00:00:01.709> a<00:00:01.770> BMW<00:00:02.449> most

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
checking fuel pressure on a BMW most

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.530 
checking fuel pressure on a BMW most
BMWs<00:00:04.140> have<00:00:04.380> a<00:00:04.410> Schrader<00:00:04.920> valve<00:00:05.150> some<00:00:06.150> do<00:00:06.330> not

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
BMWs have a Schrader valve some do not

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.390 
BMWs have a Schrader valve some do not
so<00:00:07.500> you're<00:00:07.740> not<00:00:07.830> gonna<00:00:07.980> be<00:00:08.069> able<00:00:08.130> to<00:00:08.250> check

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
so you're not gonna be able to check

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.140 
so you're not gonna be able to check
this<00:00:08.760> way

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
this way

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.490 
this way
this<00:00:09.540> is<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:09.860> 36<00:00:10.860> with<00:00:11.099> an<00:00:11.250> M<00:00:11.370> 52<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:12.090> you<00:00:12.349> this<00:00:13.349> is

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
this is a 36 with an M 52 to you this is

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.990 
this is a 36 with an M 52 to you this is
also<00:00:13.710> dual<00:00:14.250> Venice

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
also dual Venice

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.269 
also dual Venice
so<00:00:15.360> it<00:00:15.450> could<00:00:15.570> also<00:00:15.719> be<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:15.960> four<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.680> n54

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
so it could also be a four and n54

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.920 
so it could also be a four and n54
engine<00:00:17.359> but<00:00:18.359> even<00:00:18.930> like<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.230> N<00:00:19.350> 51<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.279> 52

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
engine but even like the N 51 and 52

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.349 
engine but even like the N 51 and 52
they<00:00:21.930> do<00:00:21.990> have<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.380> Schrader<00:00:22.650> valve<00:00:23.180> which<00:00:24.180> is

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
they do have a Schrader valve which is

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.849 
they do have a Schrader valve which is
nice<00:00:24.570> so<00:00:24.840> you<00:00:24.900> have<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.109> Schrader<00:00:25.350> valve<00:00:25.650> right

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
nice so you have a Schrader valve right

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.589 
nice so you have a Schrader valve right
here<00:00:26.130> on<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.340> fuel<00:00:26.609> rail<00:00:26.789> you<00:00:27.119> have<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.390> take

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
here on the fuel rail you have to take

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.810 
here on the fuel rail you have to take
your<00:00:27.840> vanity<00:00:28.320> covers<00:00:28.710> off<00:00:28.890> which<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.640> have

your vanity covers off which I have

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.049 
your vanity covers off which I have
videos<00:00:30.210> for<00:00:31.040> so<00:00:32.040> just<00:00:32.340> remove<00:00:32.610> your<00:00:32.790> Schrader

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
videos for so just remove your Schrader

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.510 
videos for so just remove your Schrader
valve<00:00:34.250> you<00:00:35.250> do<00:00:35.430> want<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.790> use<00:00:36.239> gloves<00:00:36.570> and

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
valve you do want to use gloves and

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:45.700 
valve you do want to use gloves and
safety<00:00:38.520> glasses<00:00:40.700> and<00:00:41.899> I<00:00:42.899> have<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.680> fuel<00:00:44.640> gauge

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
safety glasses and I have a fuel gauge

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.510 
safety glasses and I have a fuel gauge
which<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:46.739> in<00:00:47.129> psi<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.940> bar<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:49.309> I<00:00:50.309> have<00:00:50.489> a

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.600 
Schrader valve adapter which is attached
to<00:00:53.460> my<00:00:53.789> fuel<00:00:54.239> gauge<00:00:54.559> and<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.890> just<00:00:56.100> simply<00:00:56.460> go

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
to my fuel gauge and you just simply go

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.260 
to my fuel gauge and you just simply go
ahead<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.030> screw<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.480> on<00:00:58.460> you<00:00:59.460> usually<00:00:59.730> will

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
ahead and screw that on you usually will

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.920 
ahead and screw that on you usually will
lose<00:01:00.510> some<00:01:00.780> fuel<00:01:01.670> so<00:01:02.670> it's<00:01:02.820> good<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.210> put<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.629> rag

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
lose some fuel so it's good to put a rag

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:12.380 
lose some fuel so it's good to put a rag
or<00:01:07.310> paper<00:01:08.310> towels<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:10.170> catch<00:01:10.850> the<00:01:11.850> residual

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
or paper towels to catch the residual

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.870 
or paper towels to catch the residual
fuel<00:01:12.630> once<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.350> Schrader<00:01:13.619> valve<00:01:13.710> engages<00:01:14.490> I'm

that<00:01:39.390> snug<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:40.020> can<00:01:40.290> check<00:01:40.500> my<00:01:40.530> fuel<00:01:40.950> pressure

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
that snug I can check my fuel pressure

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.260 
that snug I can check my fuel pressure
now<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.620> vehicle<00:01:44.100> has<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.250> be<00:01:44.520> running<00:01:44.910> to

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
now the vehicle has to be running to

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.480 
now the vehicle has to be running to
check<00:01:45.480> fuel<00:01:45.720> pressure<00:01:49.130> I'm<00:01:50.130> going<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.400> go

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
check fuel pressure I'm going to go

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.300 
check fuel pressure I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.820> start<00:01:51.060> this<00:01:51.320> off<00:01:52.320> before<00:01:52.620> I<00:01:52.890> start

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
ahead and start this off before I start

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.660 
ahead and start this off before I start
I'm<00:01:53.820> going<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.090> check<00:01:54.360> for<00:01:55.340> get<00:01:56.340> out<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.610> the

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
I'm going to check for get out of the

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.880 
I'm going to check for get out of the
Sun<00:01:56.910> I'm<00:01:57.390> going<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.630> check<00:01:57.840> for<00:01:57.870> prime<00:01:58.620> pulse

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
Sun I'm going to check for prime pulse

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.950 
Sun I'm going to check for prime pulse
I'm<00:01:59.880> going<00:02:00.300> to<00:02:00.450> go<00:02:00.600> ahead<00:02:00.720> and<00:02:01.250> unlock<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.460> car

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
I'm going to go ahead and unlock the car

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.850 
I'm going to go ahead and unlock the car
sometimes<00:02:03.960> that'll<00:02:04.560> initiate<00:02:06.080> my<00:02:07.080> fuel<00:02:07.590> pump

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
sometimes that'll initiate my fuel pump

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.740 
sometimes that'll initiate my fuel pump
to<00:02:07.920> do<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.190> prime<00:02:08.490> pulse<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:09.060> don't<00:02:09.360> see<00:02:09.540> anything

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
to do a prime pulse I don't see anything

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:26.140 
to do a prime pulse I don't see anything
there<00:02:10.140> but<00:02:10.679> go<00:02:10.890> ahead<00:02:11.010> and<00:02:11.130> cycle<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.670> key<00:02:11.850> on

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:33.670 

now<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.180> heard<00:02:27.540> my<00:02:27.750> pump<00:02:28.020> run

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.120 

you

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:44.309 

and<00:02:38.670> there's<00:02:39.180> my<00:02:39.390> prime<00:02:39.690> pulse

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.599 

which<00:02:44.950> is<00:02:45.219> close<00:02:45.610> to<00:02:45.640> three<00:02:46.090> and<00:02:46.180> a<00:02:46.269> half<00:02:46.450> bar

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:47.609 
which is close to three and a half bar

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:53.069 
which is close to three and a half bar
or<00:02:48.609> 50<00:02:49.510> psi<00:02:51.299> that's<00:02:52.299> actually<00:02:52.689> a<00:02:52.719> really<00:02:52.959> good

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
or 50 psi that's actually a really good

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.490 
or 50 psi that's actually a really good
prime<00:02:53.469> pulse<00:02:54.450> so<00:02:55.450> another<00:02:55.780> test<00:02:56.049> you<00:02:56.170> could<00:02:56.349> do

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
prime pulse so another test you could do

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.800 
prime pulse so another test you could do
would<00:02:56.680> be<00:02:56.859> a<00:02:56.890> bleed<00:02:57.280> down<00:02:57.459> test<00:02:57.819> does<00:02:58.629> this

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
would be a bleed down test does this

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.229 
would be a bleed down test does this
bleed<00:02:59.140> down<00:02:59.379> or<00:02:59.620> does<00:02:59.769> it<00:02:59.799> hold<00:03:00.069> pressure<00:03:00.400> so

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
bleed down or does it hold pressure so

minutes<00:03:05.049> I<00:03:05.170> could<00:03:05.319> come<00:03:05.500> back<00:03:05.650> and<00:03:05.709> check<00:03:06.040> it

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
minutes I could come back and check it

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.270 
minutes I could come back and check it
and<00:03:06.370> see<00:03:06.700> how<00:03:07.090> much<00:03:07.269> pressure<00:03:07.569> loss<00:03:07.930> I<00:03:08.140> have

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
and see how much pressure loss I have

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.679 
and see how much pressure loss I have
this<00:03:09.280> would<00:03:09.459> be<00:03:09.609> to<00:03:09.730> check<00:03:09.939> see<00:03:10.299> if<00:03:10.389> you<00:03:10.510> have<00:03:10.659> a

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:10.689 
this would be to check see if you have a

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:15.000 
this would be to check see if you have a

leaking injector or a check valve in the
fuel<00:03:15.370> pump<00:03:15.639> could<00:03:15.790> be<00:03:15.939> bad<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.950> that<00:03:18.459> will

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
fuel pump could be bad and that will

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.550 
fuel pump could be bad and that will
cause<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:18.970> bleed<00:03:19.180> down<00:03:19.359> potentially<00:03:20.139> an

cause the bleed down potentially an

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.699 
cause the bleed down potentially an
extended<00:03:21.340> crank<00:03:21.670> situation<00:03:22.629> so<00:03:23.470> I'm<00:03:23.560> going<00:03:23.680> to

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
extended crank situation so I'm going to

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.289 
extended crank situation so I'm going to
go<00:03:23.799> ahead<00:03:23.919> and<00:03:24.129> start<00:03:24.370> this<00:03:24.549> and<00:03:24.819> we<00:03:24.939> can<00:03:25.120> see

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
go ahead and start this and we can see

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:32.520 
go ahead and start this and we can see
what<00:03:25.569> my<00:03:26.319> running<00:03:27.280> pressure<00:03:27.519> is<00:03:31.169> my<00:03:32.169> running

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
what my running pressure is my running

what my running pressure is my running
pressure<00:03:32.799> is<00:03:33.359> slightly<00:03:34.359> higher<00:03:34.780> I<00:03:35.139> read<00:03:35.859> the

this<00:03:39.819> is<00:03:39.879> good<00:03:40.209> field<00:03:40.480> pressure

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
this is good field pressure

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:49.350 
this is good field pressure
