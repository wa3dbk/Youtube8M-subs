straight<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.749> the<00:00:21.869> unboxing<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.619> first<00:00:22.769> look

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:23.009 
straight to the unboxing and first look

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:25.759 
straight to the unboxing and first look
so<00:00:23.419> starting<00:00:24.419> off<00:00:24.509> having<00:00:25.079> a<00:00:25.229> look<00:00:25.380> around<00:00:25.499> the

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
so starting off having a look around the

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.040 
so starting off having a look around the
box<00:00:25.979> it's<00:00:26.369> not<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.819> traditional<00:00:27.390> Samsung

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
box it's not the traditional Samsung

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.989 
box it's not the traditional Samsung
boxes<00:00:28.739> that<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:28.919> have<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.309> ones<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.819> used

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:29.999 
boxes that you have the ones that used

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:31.399 
boxes that you have the ones that used
to<00:00:30.029> have<00:00:30.179> before<00:00:30.359> which<00:00:30.720> were<00:00:30.839> the<00:00:30.960> white<00:00:31.169> ones

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:31.409 
to have before which were the white ones

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:33.259 
to have before which were the white ones
you've<00:00:31.800> got<00:00:31.829> this<00:00:32.070> sort<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.309> wood<00:00:32.579> effect<00:00:32.789> and

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:33.269 
you've got this sort of wood effect and

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:36.529 
you've got this sort of wood effect and
I<00:00:33.780> believe<00:00:34.199> there<00:00:34.620> are<00:00:34.649> using<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.640> recyclable

00:00:36.529 --> 00:00:36.539 
I believe there are using the recyclable

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:39.200 
I believe there are using the recyclable
material<00:00:36.989> on<00:00:37.109> here<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.590> it's<00:00:37.940> printed<00:00:38.940> with<00:00:39.179> a

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
material on here and it's printed with a

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.389 
material on here and it's printed with a
soy<00:00:39.539> ink<00:00:39.839> as<00:00:40.050> well<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.469> something<00:00:41.160> trying<00:00:41.339> to

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
soy ink as well so something trying to

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.910 
soy ink as well so something trying to
do<00:00:41.519> their<00:00:41.699> part<00:00:41.780> this<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.079> black<00:00:43.500> mixed

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
do their part this is the black mixed

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.380 
do their part this is the black mixed
version<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.339> I've<00:00:44.429> got<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.670> 16<00:00:45.030> gigabyte

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
version that I've got the 16 gigabyte

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.540 
version that I've got the 16 gigabyte
version<00:00:45.749> it<00:00:46.230> does<00:00:46.469> have<00:00:46.739> at<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.190> quad-core

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
version it does have at the quad-core

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.700 
version it does have at the quad-core
processor<00:00:48.210> not<00:00:48.359> the<00:00:48.539> octa-core<00:00:48.989> processor

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
processor not the octa-core processor

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.860 
processor not the octa-core processor
those<00:00:50.699> are<00:00:50.940> still<00:00:51.149> not<00:00:51.300> widely<00:00:51.659> available

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
those are still not widely available

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.319 
those are still not widely available
right<00:00:52.350> now<00:00:52.559> but<00:00:52.829> um<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.429> is<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.850> quad<00:00:54.149> core

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
right now but um this is the quad core

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.419 
right now but um this is the quad core
processor<00:00:54.899> from<00:00:55.499> benchmarks<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.129> I've<00:00:56.280> seen

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:56.429 
processor from benchmarks that I've seen

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:58.130 
processor from benchmarks that I've seen
anyway<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.940> doesn't<00:00:57.120> make<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.480> huge<00:00:57.719> deal<00:00:57.989> of

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
anyway it doesn't make a huge deal of

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.169 
anyway it doesn't make a huge deal of
difference<00:00:58.319> anyway<00:00:58.769> so<00:00:59.280> what<00:00:59.489> let's<00:00:59.819> get<00:01:00.120> this

00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:00.179 
difference anyway so what let's get this

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:04.850 
difference anyway so what let's get this
open<00:01:01.909> just<00:01:02.909> break<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.659> seals<00:01:04.140> we<00:01:04.350> both<00:01:04.530> here

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
in here and along this side as well okay

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.179 
in here and along this side as well okay
so<00:01:17.149> let's<00:01:18.149> get<00:01:18.390> this<00:01:18.600> out<00:01:18.899> of<00:01:19.320> its<00:01:19.680> box<00:01:19.950> and

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
so let's get this out of its box and

there we have it as I mentioned it is
the<00:01:22.350> black<00:01:23.100> mist<00:01:23.610> version<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.570> I've<00:01:24.689> got

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
let's look up we'll leave this to the

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.440 
let's look up we'll leave this to the
side<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.340> look<00:01:29.579> at<00:01:29.729> what<00:01:29.939> else<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.240> get

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.429 
adapter with the other unit as well so
now<00:02:00.210> this<00:02:00.359> is<00:02:00.570> obvious<00:02:00.810> going<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.020> depend<00:02:01.320> on

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
now this is obvious going to depend on

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.310 
now this is obvious going to depend on
where<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:01.829> are<00:02:02.310> now<00:02:02.909> one<00:02:03.119> thing<00:02:03.299> that's<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.990> can

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
where you are now one thing that's I can

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.349 
where you are now one thing that's I can
already<00:02:04.560> see<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.490> fact<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:05.820> these<00:02:06.119> are

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:06.359 
already see is the fact that these are

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:08.270 
already see is the fact that these are
wise<00:02:06.689> even<00:02:06.960> though<00:02:07.140> I've<00:02:07.320> got<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.619> black<00:02:07.829> mist

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
wise even though I've got the black mist

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.920 
wise even though I've got the black mist
version<00:02:08.760> which<00:02:09.210> is<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.390> little<00:02:09.450> bit<00:02:09.690> annoying

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:09.930 
version which is a little bit annoying

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
version which is a little bit annoying
because<00:02:10.680> my<00:02:11.370> previous<00:02:11.640> my<00:02:12.000> Galaxy<00:02:12.480> s3

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
because my previous my Galaxy s3

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.699 
because my previous my Galaxy s3
a<00:02:13.980> white<00:02:14.400> version<00:02:14.849> but<00:02:15.300> all<00:02:15.630> of<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.050> bits<00:02:16.260> side

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
a white version but all of the bits side

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:17.510 
a white version but all of the bits side
of<00:02:17.010> wall

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
of wall

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.059 
of wall
black<00:02:17.819> so<00:02:18.209> I'm<00:02:18.510> in<00:02:18.780> consistently<00:02:19.560> there<00:02:19.890> it

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
black so I'm in consistently there it

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.260 
black so I'm in consistently there it
would<00:02:20.190> be<00:02:20.310> nice<00:02:20.520> if<00:02:20.760> they<00:02:20.910> kept<00:02:21.180> that

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
would be nice if they kept that

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.089 
would be nice if they kept that
consistent<00:02:21.810> but<00:02:22.200> anyway<00:02:22.470> let's<00:02:22.709> look<00:02:22.770> at<00:02:22.980> what

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
consistent but anyway let's look at what

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.979 
consistent but anyway let's look at what
else<00:02:23.220> you<00:02:23.400> get<00:02:23.520> on<00:02:23.670> here<00:02:23.880> so<00:02:24.060> this<00:02:24.209> is<00:02:24.420> the

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
as well to make it fits a little bit

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.199 
as well okay so let's put the battery in
and<00:03:56.910> put<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:57.810> casing<00:03:58.400> back<00:03:59.400> on<00:03:59.640> so<00:03:59.970> that

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
and put the casing back on so that

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.940 
and put the casing back on so that
should<00:04:00.510> just<00:04:00.810> clip<00:04:01.380> into<00:04:01.950> place<00:04:02.780> so<00:04:03.780> so<00:04:04.530> having

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
should just clip into place so so having

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.819 
should just clip into place so so having
a<00:04:05.069> look<00:04:05.280> around<00:04:05.549> the<00:04:06.090> phone<00:04:06.420> here<00:04:06.900> you've<00:04:07.590> got

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
a look around the phone here you've got

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.920 
a look around the phone here you've got
the<00:04:08.069> four<00:04:08.430> point<00:04:08.640> nine<00:04:08.819> nine<00:04:08.850> inch<00:04:09.420> or<00:04:09.660> five

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
the four point nine nine inch or five

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.300 
the four point nine nine inch or five
inches<00:04:10.170> I<00:04:10.410> think<00:04:10.590> they<00:04:10.650> rounded<00:04:10.950> off<00:04:11.040> to<00:04:11.130> five

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310
