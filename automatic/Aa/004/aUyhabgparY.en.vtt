00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 hello everyone with you sanya steve today 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.150
 I'll show you how to build a tree farm 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.690
 that is, the forester or how to call him even 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.670
 I do not know what we need for 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.080
 buildings you can see here in this 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.820
 the coffer we will need 11 corpse 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.820
 transport stone well or any of those 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.789
 do you like there one diamond tube 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.920
 actually one farmer forester this one 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.160
 lumberjack two engine domestic 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.969
 combustion two levers humus 400k approximately 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.680
 Well, for starters, and seedlings 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:41.760
 how it all works and is built like you 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.160
 see my farmer he's already built up here 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.480
 humus around his working area 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:52.050
 is 2 blocks 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:53.940
 not like a wheat company and I actually 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.579
 I'll talk about some of the nuances then 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.590
 have you turned your farmer on 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.989
 example, everything was refueled with water 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.820
 I connected so pompa so that it does not 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.250
 I have overheated the pump I already showed how 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.650
 well let's not interrupt 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.670
 topic and what happens here after 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.010
 the nagus moussa grows a tree 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.900
 humus is replaced by sand and and proper 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.150
 this is probably the biggest minus of this 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.210
 firms because we constantly have to 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.820
 replenish this firm with humus so that she 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.530
 worked permanent ie if humus 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.799
 will result in trees going down 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.799
 will not 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.100
 This is what the left slot menu looks like. 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:37.330
 we can humus right in the middle more precisely we 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.070
 we put our our seedlings in the right slot 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.340
 fold sand sand appears 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.310
 after sprouting trees to the rescue and what 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.079
 do we do 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.509
 how do we connect there too 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:52.829
 small such a nuance so i'm stuck 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:55.220
 what kind of lags then let's take these 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.220
 here pipe 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.250
 so how do we connect 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.829
 here we connect so put here 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.140
 actually our diamond pipe which 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.979
 we will need here we do 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.979
 in the following way 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.180
 hold the pipe so that it does not 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:23.350
 connected stand and connect like this 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.570
 that's what i do so i do so for 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.640
 the fact that the wood will be 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.370
 From our logger to leave only with 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.210
 side and all the saplings and apples 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.620
 will only come out from the top 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.840
 why I didnâ€™t connect this pipe 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.100
 immediately to our farmer because apples 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.960
 then fold when they they 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.420
 will just fall out well and actually 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.750
 disappear so that we all 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.720
 set up open our diamond pipe 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:53.410
 We look that yellow it 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:57.510
 for a second 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.510
 For a second, I hit something up. 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.230
 right all the same to do it will be better 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.230
 like this 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.660
 now wait a second so i figured out what 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.220
 there was a problem let's set am 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.349
 connect a little bit like that but on the other 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.930
 in principle, the essence does not change that is 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:19.930
 now we open our panel 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.500
 pipe settings and in the blue slot we 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.880
 we put 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.860
 actually our seedlings which we have 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.100
 there will fall out there ie dependencies 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.320
 from those derekom we will plant and 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:34.530
 all in the yellow tube 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.570
 we already put that is all that to us 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.150
 need to store ie this tree 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.070
 which will be harvested by our lumberjack 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.350
 apples and 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.750
 Well, actually you can also sand there 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.290
 put which will appear after 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.290
 humus 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.069
 and remember and said no I will say it again 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.360
 just in case the sand 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:04:00.400
 appears after helping and 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:03.910
 our own tree grows so 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.470
 what else did I not tell you in general 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.850
 let's see how our work will work 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.870
 combine turn on the engine I want to note 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.870
 what harvester 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.669
 More precisely, our lumberjack, he does not cut it down 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.060
 the foliage, that is, the foliage falls by itself 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:23.600
 in time he chops down only the root of the foliage 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.979
 owl falls but then what does not fall out then 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.930
 there is here here if it falls out 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:27.320
 some even then I did not have time 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.930
 pick up 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.850
 will see no in my inventory he 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.310
 collects all these seedlings that's how I and 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:38.449
 spoke seedlings go over the top they don't 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:40.490
 go straight here and they will now 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:42.500
 reroute the blue pipe back 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.669
 here to seedlings to us replenished 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:49.070
 automatically how to build a pump 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.870
 showed like everything said if you 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.990
 have any asked question is question 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.870
 oh my god i don't know anything else 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.169
 talk like u crap well in general if you have 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.080
 any questions arise 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:03.789
 because of the offer or something 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.620
 incomprehensible write in the comments 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:09.400
