00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.350
 hi all i you come to my channel having a 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.139
 time again another halloween makeup 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.940
 this time it's super tenebrous is an effect 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.450
 of stitching both on the forehead and on the 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.949
 mouth with super intense very easy 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.480
 of doing one more time does not carry effects 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.910
 rare specials only wears makeup 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.670
 so if you want to see like chaos 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.369
 watching let's start by applying a 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.349
 pretty clarita makeup base for 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.970
 give it a little more ghost effect 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.000
 and we are going to apply it for all the zones 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.420
 where are we going to teach makeup in 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.770
 terms eyelids lips the following 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.320
 step is going to be to start creating the effect 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.120
 dark eyes for that I'm going to take a 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.850
 black pencil but you can use if 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.250
 you want some cream shadows and so on 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.289
 and we're going to apply it all over the eyelid 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.260
 mobile and all the lower lashes and 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.030
 let's blur very well you have to 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.890
 be a very broad effect so no 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.329
 worry if it looks like you're 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.339
 expanding too much 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.129
 once we have the gradient that we 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:05.259
 like we are going to take a black shadow 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.390
 mate and we're going to apply it over 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:10.710
 all the area that we have applied the pencil 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.360
 the shadow in cream let's blur the 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.970
 to help us create a more gradient 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.119
 uniform I'll catch a brown shadow 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.130
 mate and then a skin-colored shadow 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:25.020
 also mate let's degrade what 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.329
 around all this black shadow 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.429
 despite it being a super intense look in 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:30.960
 the eyes has to be totally 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:33.509
 integrated gradient and that is the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.960
 time you need to get a 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.750
 total degradation and a very integration 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.460
 fluid with the same dark brown shadow 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.289
 that we have used for the beginning of 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.840
 first gradient let's use it for 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.520
 create my eyebrows I will make them very 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.439
 intense to fit with this 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.520
 eye makeup and I'm going to make them 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.520
 pretty straight 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.020
 let's start directly to create the 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.330
 stitched effect I'll take from the pallet 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.550
 12 colored flashes of metaphor and see the 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.790
 white color you can use a pencil or a 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.080
 shadow in cream let's blur it 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.179
 slightly by the areas where we are going to 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.580
 create the stitched effect that we then 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.530
 will help the volume effect let's catch 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.000
 from the same palette a black color if 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.310
 I had an eyeliner in a black pencil what 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.170
 you have at hand what you start to create 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.660
 the cut effect with a little bit of 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.130
 serpentine shape and filling in 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.880
 some parts to create an effect 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.920
 hole 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.720
 then we will take the color brown and 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.750
 start giving volume effects inside 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.660
 from the hole 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.310
 well better hollow be several we should 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.810
 apply this brown in the inner area 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.160
 of the lips and now we are going to take a 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.750
 red and we're going to start applying a 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.670
 more effect ifr a little blood but 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.710
 very light especially in the areas of 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.380
 the holes and a few light touches here and 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:49.080
 there in the rest of the areas of 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.820
 the cuts then let's catch we 're going to 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.260
 go back to black one more time if you had 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.760
 to laila in the app and what you have and 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.760
 let's start creating the holes 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.520
 those of the sewn at the same height in 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.959
 one side on the other side of the wound but 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.820
 they do not have to be exactly the same 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.820
 positioned then 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.670
 and now we are going to connect them so 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.220
 we will make the points effect and we will 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.750
 do a little bit of curvature like 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.580
 you see, not all the points are exactly 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.050
 same are they are a bit crooked more 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.530
 than others to do a little more 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.530
 realistic 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.599
 the next step will be to start 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.099
 create the volume effect for that we're going to 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.379
 take the brown color and let's start 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:31.090
 to apply it diffused mind in between 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:33.599
 of the points without reaching the line of 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.599
 the wound 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.560
 this part is super important for 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.420
 Make makeup more realistic like this 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.060
 Take your time and blend well and 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.760
 also takes advantage of integrating the zones 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.040
 brown connection but as you see 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.290
 there is an effect of a kind of 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.600
 white halo around the dots 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.640
 in the wound and then there's the brown area 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.340
 blurred as you see is what gives the 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.960
 realism so take your time and 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.220
 do it carefully to create an effect 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.220
 much more realistic 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.510
 obviously you do not even need 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:15.439
 Say that you can do this with shadow 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:17.209
 brown with shadow brown cream with pencil 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:19.709
 brown everything you have that you can 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.860
 work with him and blur him 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.630
 the last touch will be to catch the color 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.720
 red and we are going to put some touches on the 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:31.430
 base of the points alternatively a 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.430
 Once we have this done we are going to finish 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:43.090
 very striking good you know is very 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.040
 little bit for halloween a few days a couple 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.200
 of more tutorials and it's over 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.360
 that yes remember that once or a couple of 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.070
 every month I will continue uploading videos of 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.570
 special effects and see you in the 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.570
 next happy halloween chao
