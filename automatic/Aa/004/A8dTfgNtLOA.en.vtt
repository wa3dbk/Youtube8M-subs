00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:29.970
 further video for tacking us with you 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:33.840
 you need to cut these squares 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.870
 I have a square of 16 by 16 and I need two 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.600
 stuff i mean upper bottom here 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.780
 so I have such a lower such upper 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.520
 we will also need a sintepon from me 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.350
 These are the pieces that I did not have 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.440
 solid piece on if you have a goal 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.320
 don't take one piece and we need it all 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.590
 put together so that the fabrics were 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.480
 outside sintepon inside 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.910
 i will do two tacks so i 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.620
 prepared here a kit for one 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.309
 tack and here's a set for the second 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.500
 tack also we need needles 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.930
 on different pieces of felt because I want 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.320
 make an application on these tack and 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.979
 scissors and I scribble as if on a garment 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.500
 typewriter potholders do stozhku let 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.320
 start to get started we need like me 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.600
 said like that folded and on the garment 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.100
 typewriter stitch you can 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.409
 do squares can do 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.690
 triangles anything i will do 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.299
 the most common square first i will knock 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.920
 on the perimeter then sweep in 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.790
 this direction and in the other direction 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.790
 and all 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:54.430
 that's what I got such squares 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.470
 simple on the wrong side so now 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.600
 first we need to close these 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.120
 ugly edges for this i cut out 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.860
 strips of felt two centimeters I have 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.490
 the width of it and now i just overlay 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.090
 how 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.490
 and gently begin to sew the most 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.100
 usual tishkom you can flash on 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.640
 sewing machine can manually do 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.640
 as you wish 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.400
 I turned out like this 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.410
 processed edge 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.410
 so i need to do with all four 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.080
 sides and on 2 tack I will do 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.880
 in the same way just take for example 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.220
 some brown felt 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.520
 Basically choose this color felt 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.860
 that you like it here I have already closed 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.290
 felt all the edges and now i want for 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.170
 tack make a loop for this i 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.239
 I use again a piece of felt and just 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.880
 on his back gently 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:11.200
 very sew on me 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:14.739
 It turned out that I already 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.650
 sheathed on the edges of the felt my two tacks 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.430
 Now I cut out a carrot 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.830
 leaf 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.950
 here are cherries to make an appliquÃ© 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:26.830
 on these tack publications I will 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.620
 sew in the most usual way just 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.720
 here on the contour if you want you can 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.260
 in principle, do any application 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.700
 which you will like but i will make such 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.680
 uncomplicated it seems to me that she 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:43.260
 fits well on my tack 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.260
 and so now I will sew it all 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.590
 I got two so cute 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.290
 pot holders it seems to me that they will decorate 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:28.000
 any kitchen will refresh them try them 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.000
 they do not difficult to make 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.600
