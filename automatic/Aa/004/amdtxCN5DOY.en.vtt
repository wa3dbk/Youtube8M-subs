00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.539
 Today I chat full of the map 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.089
 populated by domino kathy kelly 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:52.280
 a lot of stopps drivers and 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:54.890
 meanwhile nearly 190,000 where of it 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.260
 I can only dream and we were 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.309
 here today with the galileo team and 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.409
 filmed a bit but 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.179
 Apart from that, I have the card 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:11.600
 asked if she bock me just once 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:13.400

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.510
 totally unprepared we actually have 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.330
 actually the whole time now 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.830
 nonsense but we only have this 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.180
 youtube shows spoken i find it 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.830
 now at the time something else too 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.960
 tell 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.350
 that's possible, what can I do? 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:30.440
 outside of youtube tell 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.300
 I will be what I am after my high school diploma 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.210
 Now he is writing a month for a month 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.610
 go abroad as if he's in the us 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.040
 and then hopefully in America 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.410
 continue to make videos and then you are 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.630
 mediate child lifestyle and that's the way it is 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.490
 cool where s then back there is so 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.050
 not fixed so I still all this 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.120
 a little bit in the making of 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.100
 which family would like to have me because 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.690
 I do not and that's still where I decide 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:02:03.290
 but I prefer to go, I think 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:04.880
 the east coast has a plan what I have to do so 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.190
 ball be all be broken times 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:15.260
 I have to leave soon, I have to 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:17.420
 then in the west without really the same 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.400
 everyone finds it had to shoot 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.720
 that you too are going out of the store you 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.520
 go out of the shop now 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.420
 and is always a relatively small one 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.970
 disoriented person i believe that 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.400
 you can imagine it to me 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.610
 east coast spokesman up in new 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.280
 york or further down what would it be 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.810
 meanwhile I find you boston or 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.560
 so what near york if so 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.470
 I might not be so bad 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.200
 but or philadelphia I have all 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.430
 be cool because i do not let me 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.980
 to surprise 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.010
 would be not bad or Mainz 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:56.300
 who I do not live so big city standard 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.560
 in the village but he i do not know so boston 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.780
 i was not new york boston yet 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.370
 the hammer is the good thing about this giant 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.130
 That's another thing for cities 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.260
 It's a bit like a village because you're out 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.180
 this area does not come out if you 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.800
 Manhattan to Manhattan bis 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.450
 to speak that he is you in the lower 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.420
 east side then you stay mostly 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.500
 in lower east side then it stops 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.090
 The little one is a little bit 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.220
 like in Berlin 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.900
 if you where it allowed to cross in mountain then 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.209
 you somehow in Kreuzberg you are reading 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.370
 so often out so it has something similar to me 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.690
 only you feel the size of the city 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.040
 that's the breed i think i 'm too big 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.480
 new york myself, but i like it 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.250
 I have to inform myself 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.780
 which cities now have something like us 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.580
 not but i think i will now 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.800
 first depending on the family make 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.880
 I hope I would like to have that 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.880
 hope you do not come to texas 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.300
 then but Cadu I've got something 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.069
 thought but it has so in my 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.620
 Organization is sitting so it is 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.750
 Alright okay safada Canada 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.340

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:04.780
 Of course you also ride in pretty well 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:05.500
 a mine in from edmonton where is in 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.099
 edmonton 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.319
 the state is there I'm stupid me 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:13.209

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:15.760
 I'm so, I forgot was in 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:18.070

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.410
 Bundestag Alberta are there you can 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:29.710
 for example dinosaurs dig up the 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:32.080

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:35.350

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.840

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.090
 Land is full of dinosaurs 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.200
 that's incredible where the big one 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.960
 dinosaurs die 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.520

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.950

 English so I have something in chic 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:04.690
 but now I think I'm already in 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.789
 so sometimes I'm in the upper direction 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.810
 I still lack the flowing one 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:09.430
 a bit because I stop the exercise myself 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.620
