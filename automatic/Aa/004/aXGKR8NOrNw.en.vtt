that<00:01:44.160> stop<00:01:44.610> right<00:01:45.090> because<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.720> do<00:01:46.020> too<00:01:46.230> little

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
that stop right because it do too little

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.170 
that stop right because it do too little
either<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:47.070> keep<00:01:47.280> going<00:01:47.490> forward<00:01:47.910> and<00:01:47.970> if<00:01:48.090> you

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
either you keep going forward and if you

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.820 
either you keep going forward and if you
do<00:01:48.330> too<00:01:48.540> much<00:01:48.690> you<00:01:48.930> end<00:01:49.110> up<00:01:49.230> on<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.410> flying

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
do too much you end up on a flying

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.000 
do too much you end up on a flying
backwards<00:01:50.400> so<00:01:51.000> instead<00:01:51.770> we're<00:01:52.770> going<00:01:52.800> to

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
backwards so instead we're going to

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.790 
backwards so instead we're going to
actually<00:01:53.250> go<00:01:53.760> past<00:01:54.210> our<00:01:54.600> target<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.380> then

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
actually go past our target and then

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.830 
actually go past our target and then
turn<00:01:56.100> around<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.550> face<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.300> I<00:01:57.330> said<00:01:57.570> again

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
turn around and face it so I said again

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.330 
turn around and face it so I said again
we're<00:01:57.960> gonna<00:01:58.020> go<00:01:58.229> we're<00:01:58.590> going<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.770> approach<00:01:59.070> a

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
we're gonna go we're going to approach a

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.700 
we're gonna go we're going to approach a
target<00:01:59.820> we're<00:02:00.240> gonna<00:02:00.330> go<00:02:00.540> past<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.260> target

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
target we're gonna go past the target

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.190 
target we're gonna go past the target
and<00:02:01.830> then<00:02:01.979> turn<00:02:02.280> around<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.729> face<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.630> now

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
and then turn around and face it now

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.660 
and then turn around and face it now
what<00:02:04.410> we're<00:02:04.500> going<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.680> do<00:02:04.770> this<00:02:04.890> can<00:02:05.280> use<00:02:05.490> as<00:02:05.640> a

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
what we're going to do this can use as a

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.460 
what we're going to do this can use as a
whole<00:02:05.910> bunch<00:02:06.150> of<00:02:06.330> the<00:02:06.479> controls<00:02:06.900> together

whole bunch of the controls together

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.880 
whole bunch of the controls together
we're<00:02:08.130> gonna<00:02:08.250> turn<00:02:08.869> to<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.990> left<00:02:10.140> but<00:02:10.740> at<00:02:10.860> the

we're gonna turn to the left but at the

we're<00:02:15.270> also<00:02:15.510> going<00:02:15.990> to<00:02:16.050> slightly<00:02:16.410> roll<00:02:17.190> with

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
we're also going to slightly roll with

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.170 
we're also going to slightly roll with
the<00:02:18.660> either<00:02:19.320> the<00:02:19.620> mouse<00:02:19.890> or<00:02:20.310> your<00:02:20.489> right<00:02:20.820> stick

on your joystick or pad and halfway

on your joystick or pad and halfway
through<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:24.420> turn<00:02:25.190> we're<00:02:26.190> gonna<00:02:26.340> stop

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
through that turn we're gonna stop

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.540 
through that turn we're gonna stop
rolling<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.720> we're<00:02:28.260> going<00:02:28.440> to<00:02:28.470> pull<00:02:28.770> back<00:02:29.190> on

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
rolling and we're going to pull back on

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.120 
rolling and we're going to pull back on
the<00:02:30.360> role<00:02:31.020> to<00:02:31.230> kind<00:02:31.380> of<00:02:31.440> picture<00:02:31.830> selves

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
the role to kind of picture selves

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.580 
the role to kind of picture selves
backwards<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:33.600> then<00:02:34.020> we're<00:02:34.170> also<00:02:34.290> going<00:02:34.530> to

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
backwards and then we're also going to

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.260 
backwards and then we're also going to
add<00:02:34.770> a<00:02:34.800> little<00:02:35.070> bit<00:02:35.250> of<00:02:35.310> Rev<00:02:35.640> so<00:02:35.910> there's<00:02:36.090> three

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
add a little bit of Rev so there's three

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.490 
add a little bit of Rev so there's three
parts<00:02:36.630> to<00:02:36.989> this<00:02:37.290> term<00:02:37.830> and<00:02:38.540> you<00:02:39.540> you're<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.380> the

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
parts to this term and you you're to the

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.220 
parts to this term and you you're to the
left<00:02:40.530> when<00:02:40.920> you<00:02:40.950> turn<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.520> the<00:02:41.610> left<00:02:41.840> you<00:02:42.840> roll

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
left when you turn to the left you roll

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.199 
left when you turn to the left you roll
to<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.560> left<00:02:43.680> halfway<00:02:44.340> through<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.790> turn<00:02:45.030> you

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
to the left halfway through the turn you

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.630 
to the left halfway through the turn you
stop<00:02:45.570> rolling<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:46.260> pull<00:02:46.470> back<00:02:46.769> and<00:02:47.250> you

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
stop rolling and you pull back and you

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.250 
stop rolling and you pull back and you
add<00:02:47.760> a<00:02:47.790> little<00:02:48.060> bit<00:02:48.239> of<00:02:48.299> Rev<00:02:48.660> there<00:02:48.930> as<00:02:49.080> well

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
add a little bit of Rev there as well

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.600 
add a little bit of Rev there as well
and<00:02:49.440> of<00:02:49.500> course<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.769> move<00:02:49.890> is<00:02:50.100> exactly<00:02:50.489> the

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
and of course the move is exactly the

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.160 
and of course the move is exactly the
same<00:02:50.760> other<00:02:51.000> way<00:02:51.090> around<00:02:51.299> so<00:02:51.810> look<00:02:51.959> about

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
same other way around so look about

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.890 
same other way around so look about
there<00:02:52.380> so<00:02:52.590> we<00:02:52.680> turned<00:02:52.980> we<00:02:53.850> rolled<00:02:54.209> halfway

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
there so we turned we rolled halfway

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.300 
there so we turned we rolled halfway
through<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.140> term<00:02:55.350> we<00:02:55.590> pull<00:02:55.830> back<00:02:56.100> on<00:02:56.280> the

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
through the term we pull back on the

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.449 
through the term we pull back on the
role<00:02:56.820> and<00:02:57.120> that<00:02:57.810> we<00:02:58.049> added<00:02:58.410> a<00:02:58.590> bit<00:02:58.769> of<00:02:58.830> rib<00:02:59.280> and

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
role and that we added a bit of rib and

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.190 
role and that we added a bit of rib and
with<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.940> advantage<00:03:00.299> of<00:03:00.420> that<00:03:00.510> turn<00:03:00.810> is<00:03:00.989> when

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
with the advantage of that turn is when

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.110 
with the advantage of that turn is when
you<00:03:01.350> complete<00:03:01.890> it<00:03:01.920> you<00:03:02.100> actually<00:03:02.730> end<00:03:02.940> up

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
you complete it you actually end up

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.110 
you complete it you actually end up
traveling<00:03:03.570> a<00:03:03.690> very<00:03:04.049> slow<00:03:04.440> speed<00:03:04.910> facing<00:03:05.910> in

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
traveling a very slow speed facing in

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.810 
traveling a very slow speed facing in
your<00:03:06.420> target<00:03:07.410> I'm<00:03:07.920> so<00:03:08.220> sure<00:03:08.400> that<00:03:08.430> one<00:03:08.610> again

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
your target I'm so sure that one again

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.610 
your target I'm so sure that one again
we're<00:03:08.940> gonna<00:03:09.030> race<00:03:09.330> forward<00:03:09.720> as<00:03:10.019> fast<00:03:10.200> as<00:03:10.470> we

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
we're gonna race forward as fast as we

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.840 
we're gonna race forward as fast as we
can<00:03:10.910> then<00:03:11.910> we're<00:03:12.180> gonna<00:03:12.530> turn<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:13.860> roll<00:03:14.280> get

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
can then we're gonna turn and roll get

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.640 
can then we're gonna turn and roll get
rid<00:03:15.000> of<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.150> role<00:03:15.330> pulled<00:03:15.630> back<00:03:15.870> a<00:03:16.170> little<00:03:16.500> bit

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.229 
rid of the role pulled back a little bit
of<00:03:16.739> red<00:03:17.010> and<00:03:17.220> look<00:03:17.430> at<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:17.610> speed<00:03:17.880> there<00:03:18.090> we've

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
of red and look at the speed there we've

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.539
