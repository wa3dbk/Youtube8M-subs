00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
time-saver and is very similar to both

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.700 

now<00:00:32.250> watch<00:00:32.489> what's<00:00:32.730> going<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.000> happen<00:00:35.630> I'm

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
going back and back to where I left off

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.330 
going back and back to where I left off
at<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.489> other<00:00:41.640> stitch<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:43.100> then<00:00:44.100> I'm<00:00:44.219> going

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
at the other stitch and then I'm going

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.440 
at the other stitch and then I'm going
to<00:00:44.460> go<00:00:44.610> down<00:00:45.200> forward<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.469> then<00:00:47.450> through

another<00:00:49.440> eighth<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.860> an<00:00:49.950> inch<00:00:50.270> so<00:00:51.270> as<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.539> can

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
another eighth of an inch so as you can

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.310 
another eighth of an inch so as you can
see<00:00:52.020> it's<00:00:52.649> creating<00:00:53.190> two<00:00:53.850> little<00:00:54.320> ripples

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
see it's creating two little ripples

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:04.280 
see it's creating two little ripples
there<00:00:58.579> I'm<00:00:59.579> going<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.120> pull<00:01:00.420> through<00:01:01.940> and<00:01:03.290> I

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
there I'm going to pull through and I

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.710 
there I'm going to pull through and I
have<00:01:04.379> already<00:01:04.619> made<00:01:05.270> two<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.479> half

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
have already made two and a half

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:22.889 
have already made two and a half
stitches<00:01:07.880> let's<00:01:08.880> repeat<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.420> process

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:25.179 

you<00:01:23.899> want<00:01:24.109> to<00:01:24.200> try<00:01:24.380> to<00:01:24.439> have<00:01:24.649> these<00:01:24.859> stitches

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
you want to try to have these stitches

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.630 
you want to try to have these stitches
as<00:01:25.899> accurately<00:01:26.899> placed<00:01:27.259> as<00:01:27.439> possible<00:01:28.009> it's<00:01:28.579> a

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
as accurately placed as possible it's a

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.370 
as accurately placed as possible it's a
bit<00:01:28.789> hard<00:01:29.060> for<00:01:29.270> me<00:01:29.360> to<00:01:29.450> do<00:01:29.570> this<00:01:29.719> with<00:01:29.869> a<00:01:29.929> camera

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
bit hard for me to do this with a camera

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:52.630 
bit hard for me to do this with a camera
in<00:01:30.439> my<00:01:30.590> face

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.830 

another<00:01:53.640> way<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:53.790> thinking<00:01:53.939> about<00:01:54.299> how<00:01:54.659> we're

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
another way of thinking about how we're

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.780 
another way of thinking about how we're
making<00:01:55.170> this<00:01:55.320> stitch<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.830> to<00:01:56.250> think<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.640> as

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
making this stitch is to think of it as

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:14.670 
making this stitch is to think of it as
one<00:01:57.270> back<00:01:57.570> stitch<00:01:59.570> and<00:02:01.430> one<00:02:02.430> running<00:02:02.729> stitch

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.360 

at<00:02:16.210> full<00:02:17.210> speed<00:02:17.690> after<00:02:17.990> a<00:02:18.560> success<00:02:19.070> in<00:02:19.250> of

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
at full speed after a success in of

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.920 
at full speed after a success in of
these<00:02:19.520> stitches<00:02:19.760> you<00:02:20.120> can<00:02:20.270> see<00:02:20.480> they<00:02:20.660> could<00:02:20.810> be

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
these stitches you can see they could be

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.800 
these stitches you can see they could be
a<00:02:20.960> big<00:02:21.260> time-saver<00:02:22.270> let's<00:02:23.270> take<00:02:23.450> a<00:02:23.480> look<00:02:23.720> at

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
a big time-saver let's take a look at

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.290 
a big time-saver let's take a look at
what<00:02:23.960> we<00:02:24.080> have<00:02:24.230> so<00:02:24.470> far<00:02:24.500> we<00:02:24.980> have<00:02:25.790> row<00:02:26.120> of

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
what we have so far we have row of

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.170 
what we have so far we have row of
stitches<00:02:26.780> that<00:02:26.930> looks<00:02:27.230> like<00:02:27.410> a<00:02:27.440> back<00:02:27.770> stitch

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
stitches that looks like a back stitch

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.130 
stitches that looks like a back stitch
let's<00:02:29.180> take<00:02:29.330> a<00:02:29.360> look<00:02:29.510> at<00:02:29.600> what's<00:02:29.720> going<00:02:29.840> on<00:02:30.020> in

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
let's take a look at what's going on in

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.170 
let's take a look at what's going on in
the<00:02:30.200> back<00:02:32.200> whoa<00:02:33.400> it<00:02:34.400> looks<00:02:34.430> like<00:02:34.730> a<00:02:34.760> running

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
the back whoa it looks like a running

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.900 
the back whoa it looks like a running
stitch<00:02:36.070> except<00:02:37.070> if<00:02:37.220> you<00:02:37.340> look<00:02:37.520> a<00:02:37.580> little<00:02:37.700> bit

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
stitch except if you look a little bit

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.020 
stitch except if you look a little bit
closer<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:39.620> threads<00:02:39.980> are<00:02:40.160> doubled<00:02:40.550> that's

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
closer the threads are doubled that's

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.850 
closer the threads are doubled that's
because<00:02:41.420> we're<00:02:41.630> looping<00:02:41.840> back<00:02:42.200> every<00:02:42.709> other

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
because we're looping back every other

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.250 
because we're looping back every other
stitch<00:02:43.250> this<00:02:44.240> stitch<00:02:44.420> is<00:02:44.690> just<00:02:44.720> about<00:02:45.110> as

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
stitch this stitch is just about as

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.490 
stitch this stitch is just about as
strong<00:02:45.530> as<00:02:45.770> a<00:02:45.800> back<00:02:46.040> stitch<00:02:46.280> is<00:02:47.080> at<00:02:48.080> the<00:02:48.260> end<00:02:48.380> of

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
strong as a back stitch is at the end of

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.390 
strong as a back stitch is at the end of
your<00:02:48.620> stitch<00:02:48.920> tack<00:02:49.700> off<00:02:49.910> like<00:02:50.180> normal
