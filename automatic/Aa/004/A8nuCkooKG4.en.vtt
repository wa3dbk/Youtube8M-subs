00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
imaginations is the nose itself it looks

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.000 
imaginations is the nose itself it looks
like<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:48.120> sea<00:00:48.390> anemone<00:00:48.620> it<00:00:49.620> looks<00:00:49.860> like<00:00:49.980> a

uses that sea anemone thing on its nose

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.770 
uses that sea anemone thing on its nose
as<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.600> way<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.290> smell<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.369> world<00:01:08.780> which

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
as a way to smell the world which

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.859 
as a way to smell the world which
they've<00:01:10.710> discovered<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.549> not<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:12.090> case<00:01:12.360> it

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
they've discovered is not the case it

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.380 
they've discovered is not the case it
actually<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:13.710> this<00:01:14.210> touch<00:01:15.210> sensing<00:01:16.200> organ<00:01:17.390> the

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
actually is this touch sensing organ the

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.760 
actually is this touch sensing organ the
other<00:01:18.509> really<00:01:18.840> cool<00:01:19.049> thing<00:01:19.320> about<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.590> is

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
other really cool thing about it is

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.130 
other really cool thing about it is
recently<00:01:20.400> it's<00:01:20.549> been<00:01:20.729> shown<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.420> it's<00:01:21.930> the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
recently it's been shown that it's the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.499 
recently it's been shown that it's the
only<00:01:22.320> mammal<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.130> actually<00:01:23.520> be<00:01:23.640> able<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.060> smell

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
only mammal to actually be able to smell

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.490 
only mammal to actually be able to smell
underwater<00:01:25.490> and<00:01:26.490> what<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.150> does<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.990> sends

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
underwater and what it does is it sends

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.859 
underwater and what it does is it sends
out<00:01:28.829> in<00:01:29.329> these<00:01:30.650> bubbles<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.860> inhales<00:01:32.570> at<00:01:33.570> just

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
out in these bubbles and inhales at just

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.910 
out in these bubbles and inhales at just
lightning<00:01:34.350> speeds<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.369> bubbles<00:01:35.729> catch<00:01:36.920> odor

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
lightning speeds the bubbles catch odor

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.120 
lightning speeds the bubbles catch odor
molecules<00:01:38.869> underwater<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.259> as<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.619> animal

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
molecules underwater and as the animal

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.069 
molecules underwater and as the animal
inhales<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:43.110> able<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.619> sense<00:01:43.920> food<00:01:44.840> in<00:01:45.840> its

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
inhales it is able to sense food in its

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:46.760 
inhales it is able to sense food in its
environment

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
environment

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.950 
environment
underwater<00:01:47.509> most<00:01:48.509> people<00:01:49.229> look<00:01:49.950> at<00:01:49.979> the

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
underwater most people look at the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.660 
underwater most people look at the
adaptations

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
adaptations

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.230 
adaptations
that<00:01:53.799> organisms<00:01:54.799> make<00:01:55.130> to<00:01:55.340> their<00:01:55.520> environment

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
that organisms make to their environment

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.830 
that organisms make to their environment
is<00:01:56.600> an<00:01:56.810> opportunity<00:01:57.470> for<00:01:58.840> getting

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
is an opportunity for getting

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.020 
is an opportunity for getting
inspiration<00:02:00.710> to<00:02:00.950> solve<00:02:01.189> their<00:02:01.430> own<00:02:01.460> problems

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
inspiration to solve their own problems

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.359 
inspiration to solve their own problems
I<00:02:02.270> think<00:02:02.540> sometimes<00:02:03.170> what<00:02:03.350> we<00:02:03.500> forget<00:02:03.920> is<00:02:04.340> that

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
I think sometimes what we forget is that

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.919 
I think sometimes what we forget is that
a<00:02:05.030> lot<00:02:05.750> of<00:02:05.899> these<00:02:06.049> organisms<00:02:06.580> provide<00:02:07.580> us<00:02:07.790> with

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
a lot of these organisms provide us with

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.410 
a lot of these organisms provide us with
opportunities<00:02:08.929> for<00:02:09.369> wonder<00:02:10.369> that's<00:02:10.700> just<00:02:11.150> as

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
opportunities for wonder that's just as

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.440 
opportunities for wonder that's just as
important<00:02:12.050> as<00:02:12.700> solving<00:02:13.700> some<00:02:14.239> of<00:02:14.270> our

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
important as solving some of our

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.260 
important as solving some of our
critical<00:02:14.930> challenges<00:02:15.500> so<00:02:15.980> yeah<00:02:16.550> can<00:02:16.850> we<00:02:17.000> learn

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
critical challenges so yeah can we learn

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.440 
critical challenges so yeah can we learn
some<00:02:17.900> amazing<00:02:18.140> things<00:02:18.550> from<00:02:19.550> the<00:02:20.030> sensory

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
some amazing things from the sensory

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.790 
some amazing things from the sensory
apparatus<00:02:20.720> of<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.800> star-nosed<00:02:22.310> mole<00:02:22.360> nose

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
time the fact that this tiny potato

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.020 
time the fact that this tiny potato
sized<00:02:31.489> animal<00:02:32.239> has<00:02:32.870> developed<00:02:33.590> this
