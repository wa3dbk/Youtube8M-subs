00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 good morning to all the guys here e 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.279
 wife have been www.lexbook.it in 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.660
 facebook page and to our site in 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.389
 description and today we are here with the 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.910
 adebayor player view iv one player 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.099
 truly exceptional paid 24 thousand 750 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.929
 a couple of days ago with the khemis stage 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.880
 up now should be worth 20,000 and that 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.840
 everyone is worth it has nothing to envy 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.160
 strikers from 50 60 70 thousand in short is a 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.730
 player who joins his coup 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.439
 deadly head to his physical strength e 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.210
 to the south and to its triad power 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.579
 finalization because the first pro is 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.710
 secure finalization finalization 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.770
 90 which united these 92 power 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.000
 shooting other pro let you do 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.879
 almost always goals 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.160
 when you're in the last sixteen meters 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.300
 all power the goalkeeper or throw it 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.300
 in the corner 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.280
 or it is and goals because it will almost fail 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.850
 never to block it I think one out of 100 la 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.010
 blocks truly in a deadly shooting a 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.050
 a little less from the outside because it has a 79 of long 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.850
 with 76 of effect that you don't allow 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.850
 to do those pussy shots like 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.040
 in short, they could make them nasri hazard 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.439
 the exteriors that go under the intersection 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.020
 he is a player who only shoots 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.450
 from man fuck from man with i 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.720
 controcoglioni ok I said a little 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.700
 swear words does not go well and therefore throws 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.530
 really the top then there are the steps 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.290
 short a strong physical attacker 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.880
 who holds the ball and then is capable of 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.380
 discharge it really well 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.229
 because it is an 80 of the short passages that me 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.240
 liked it and then a 56 of passes 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.490
 long that I managed to make gods 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.500
 long passages don't come out 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.270
 but the maximum is not a counter 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.259
 in short, with semi- assisted he cannot be heard 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.960
 very much this flaw 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.270
 and then there's a 59 cross that goes well not 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.189
 should never be used with him because he serves in 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.439
 area to hit from head or to pull of 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.850
 power because on those his 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.689
 characteristics in short is not a 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.640
 killer and he is a finalizer 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:55.079
 the four-star skip dribbling and not 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.210
 has a dribble and exceptional because it is 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.060
 true to 85 of books and 280 of control 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.610
 ball but the 67 10 Dec to 69 of 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.560
 acceleration does not allow you to do 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.170
 right and left I would make the serpentine 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.270
 in the end, the mass is a player who goes 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.039
 much more than physical and that throws down 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.780
 of people standing in front 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.489
 however these four seeds write in short 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.680
 they also allow you to do those 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.359
 mossette to jump the man who ad 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.180
 Negred example player very similar to 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:23.430
 he can't do four star skills a 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.989
 my opinion very very useful then the item 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.500
 the physical strength physical force we have 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.959
 said the player is really a bull 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.239
 takes boot on anyone 85 of strength 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.280
 physics which is also very useful for i 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.470
 headshots head shots because it is 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.090
 another the final pro short of 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.189
 these players because every ball that 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.349
 puts in the middle is likely to be goals him 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.790
 to this 85 of physical strength he throws down a 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.819
 defender in this case you have seen 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.319
 also david lewis who fell and throws 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.959
 down the defender quietly goes to 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.510
 hit a header because he is 191 to 86 tall 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.950
 precision jump 76 is therefore a 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.090
 Header player is 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.280
 his main weapon 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.010
 speaking of against instead we speak of 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.349
 acceleration agility because it has a 69 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.750
 67 generations of agility we say 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.700
 I 'm not going to stop him from betting 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.010
 the man centrally to always go away 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.889
 in speed rather it is true at a 78 of 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.349
 shot that still does not demerit because 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:17.940
 this feature allows it to 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.319
 example of being thrown though you have to 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.729
 wait for it to arrive on the line of 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.829
 offside in such a way as to cut 

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:24.959
 right away opposing defenders 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:27.750
 the second and last against of the year is 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.699
 The shooting around rolls around because it is a 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.190
 feature that I repeat as I said 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:33.510
 first in the air is deadly then 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.000
 three-quarters of the work is done by the 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.269
 finalization 90 however from outside this 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.430
 76 of effect also in 79 of 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.930
 launch prevents you from scoring goals but 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.790
 I repeat this is a player who pulls 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.690
 power if it holds power almost always 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.609
 enter or at least know this era 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.720
 the last heavy player of the year I will 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:54.000
