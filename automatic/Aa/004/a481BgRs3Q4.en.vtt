00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
here and then we're going to have a

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.780

why did not put a name on this but this

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.320 
why did not put a name on this but this
is<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.170> hermes<00:01:55.620> cabin<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.280> didn't<00:01:56.910> put<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.090> name

would<00:02:01.050> look<00:02:01.140> like<00:02:01.220> relatively<00:02:02.900> because<00:02:03.900> like

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
would look like relatively because like

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.070 
would look like relatively because like
I<00:02:04.290> don't<00:02:04.620> really<00:02:04.770> have<00:02:05.490> like<00:02:05.880> any<00:02:06.360> idea<00:02:06.900> on

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
I don't really have like any idea on

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.540 
I don't really have like any idea on
what<00:02:07.170> these<00:02:07.530> would<00:02:07.710> look<00:02:07.860> like<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.160> just<00:02:08.369> sort

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
what these would look like I just sort

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.410 
what these would look like I just sort

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
staying in for the series random

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.140 
staying in for the series random
switches<00:04:36.419> and

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
switches and

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.720 
switches and
up-do<00:04:37.600> nothingness<00:04:38.200> I<00:04:38.440> just<00:04:39.400> put<00:04:39.580> them<00:04:39.670> there

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.510 
up-do nothingness I just put them there
and<00:04:40.170> then<00:04:41.170> here<00:04:41.470> is<00:04:41.560> a<00:04:41.590> piston<00:04:42.040> retracting

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
and then here is a piston retracting

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.940 
and then here is a piston retracting
doors<00:04:42.730> that<00:04:42.970> goes<00:04:43.180> into<00:04:43.420> the<00:04:43.630> basement<00:04:44.170> which

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
doors that goes into the basement which

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.160 
doors that goes into the basement which

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.170 
is their crafting area I have a light

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.940 
is their crafting area I have a light
switch<00:04:47.470> and<00:04:47.860> then<00:04:48.580> that<00:04:48.730> reveals<00:04:49.060> a<00:04:49.210> bed<00:04:49.510> I<00:04:49.950> did

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
switch and then that reveals a bed I did

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.340 
switch and then that reveals a bed I did
all<00:04:51.160> this<00:04:51.310> with<00:04:51.550> pistons<00:04:51.970> by<00:04:52.240> myself<00:04:52.660> no<00:04:53.050> help

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
all this with pistons by myself no help

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.820 
all this with pistons by myself no help
and<00:04:54.900> this<00:04:55.900> is<00:04:56.080> only<00:04:56.200> the<00:04:56.320> single-player<00:04:56.770> world

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
and this is only the single-player world

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.200 
and this is only the single-player world
so<00:04:57.190> it's<00:04:57.340> definitely<00:04:57.730> going<00:04:57.850> to<00:04:58.060> look

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
so it's definitely going to look

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.710 
so it's definitely going to look
different<00:04:58.330> on<00:04:58.660> the<00:04:58.900> multiplayer<00:05:00.450> this<00:05:01.450> is<00:05:01.630> the
