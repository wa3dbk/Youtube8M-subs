I<00:00:20.130> think<00:00:20.490> it<00:00:20.580> makes<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.789> Churchill<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.210> look<00:00:21.630> a

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
I think it makes the Churchill it look a

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.420 
I think it makes the Churchill it look a
little<00:00:22.289> better<00:00:22.529> than<00:00:22.769> what<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:22.920> did<00:00:23.160> look

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430
