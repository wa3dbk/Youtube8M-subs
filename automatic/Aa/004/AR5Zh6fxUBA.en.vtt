rusted<00:01:15.250> sees<00:01:16.250> themselves<00:01:16.790> so<00:01:17.210> I<00:01:17.240> ended<00:01:17.600> up

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
rusted sees themselves so I ended up

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.139 
rusted sees themselves so I ended up
breaking<00:01:18.979> them<00:01:19.399> getting<00:01:19.880> them<00:01:20.000> out<00:01:20.119> there

them I'll get those in also and this
right<00:01:33.590> here<00:01:33.890> is<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:34.340> three<00:01:34.549> liter<00:01:34.789> EFI<00:01:35.450> motor

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
right here is the three liter EFI motor

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.830 
right here is the three liter EFI motor
it's<00:01:36.590> got<00:01:36.859> a<00:01:36.890> massive<00:01:37.250> miss<00:01:37.789> and<00:01:38.149> it<00:01:38.390> also<00:01:38.570> has

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
it's got a massive miss and it also has

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.810 
it's got a massive miss and it also has
a<00:01:38.869> lot<00:01:39.289> of<00:01:39.320> lifter<00:01:39.770> chatter<00:01:40.009> noise<00:01:40.250> going<00:01:40.670> on

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
a lot of lifter chatter noise going on

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.219 
a lot of lifter chatter noise going on
which<00:01:41.329> I'll<00:01:41.479> start<00:01:41.719> it<00:01:41.780> here<00:01:41.930> in<00:01:41.990> just<00:01:42.109> a

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
which I'll start it here in just a

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.459 
which I'll start it here in just a
second<00:01:42.649> I<00:01:43.490> believe<00:01:44.450> it's<00:01:44.689> only<00:01:44.780> running<00:01:45.200> on<00:01:45.439> I

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:45.469 
second I believe it's only running on I

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:47.620 
second I believe it's only running on I
think<00:01:45.649> four<00:01:46.159> injectors<00:01:46.880> is<00:01:47.090> what<00:01:47.270> I<00:01:47.299> was<00:01:47.450> told

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
think four injectors is what I was told

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.810 
think four injectors is what I was told
from<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:47.960> best<00:01:48.140> research<00:01:48.530> I<00:01:48.679> did<00:01:48.740> that<00:01:49.609> it<00:01:49.700> had

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
from the best research I did that it had

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.399 
from the best research I did that it had
two<00:01:49.969> injectors<00:01:50.450> that<00:01:50.659> were<00:01:50.780> not<00:01:50.960> working<00:01:51.289> so

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
two injectors that were not working so

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.249 
two injectors that were not working so
it's<00:01:51.500> long<00:01:51.619> running<00:01:51.859> on<00:01:51.920> four<00:01:52.159> cylinders

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
it's long running on four cylinders

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.810 
it's long running on four cylinders
don't<00:01:54.259> know<00:01:54.350> exactly<00:01:54.740> no<00:01:55.159> more<00:01:55.369> than<00:01:55.549> I'd<00:01:55.670> done

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
don't know exactly no more than I'd done

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.730 
don't know exactly no more than I'd done
with<00:01:56.000> it<00:01:56.149> I<00:01:56.329> didn't<00:01:56.810> worry<00:01:56.990> about<00:01:57.079> it<00:01:57.229> no<00:01:57.590> more

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
with it I didn't worry about it no more

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.020 
with it I didn't worry about it no more
and<00:01:57.799> she's<00:01:58.039> doing<00:01:58.219> that<00:01:58.340> she<00:01:58.579> hasn't<00:01:58.729> worried

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
and she's doing that she hasn't worried

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.120 
and she's doing that she hasn't worried
about<00:01:59.149> it<00:01:59.329> so<00:01:59.450> it<00:02:00.170> does<00:02:00.380> have<00:02:00.619> a<00:02:00.649> drink'll

about it so it does have a drink'll

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.039 
about it so it does have a drink'll
charge<00:02:01.399> battery<00:02:02.179> charger<00:02:02.479> on<00:02:02.570> it<00:02:02.600> because<00:02:02.869> for

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
charge battery charger on it because for

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:04.239 
charge battery charger on it because for
a<00:02:03.079> long<00:02:03.229> time<00:02:03.439> she<00:02:03.649> didn't<00:02:03.859> drive<00:02:03.979> it<00:02:04.130> that

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:04.249 
a long time she didn't drive it that

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:06.190 
a long time she didn't drive it that
much<00:02:04.490> has<00:02:04.729> a<00:02:04.759> new<00:02:04.939> battery<00:02:05.179> in<00:02:05.450> it<00:02:05.539> also<00:02:05.899> and

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
much has a new battery in it also and

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.249 
much has a new battery in it also and
this<00:02:06.890> thing<00:02:07.100> has<00:02:07.249> not<00:02:07.369> been<00:02:07.609> started<00:02:07.850> for<00:02:08.660> well

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
this thing has not been started for well

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.740 
this thing has not been started for well
over<00:02:09.679> oh<00:02:10.070> crap<00:02:10.940> two<00:02:11.180> and<00:02:11.270> a<00:02:11.300> half<00:02:11.390> weeks<00:02:11.629> I

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
over oh crap two and a half weeks I

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.540 
over oh crap two and a half weeks I
think<00:02:11.959> so<00:02:12.530> we'll<00:02:12.709> see<00:02:12.860> if<00:02:12.950> it<00:02:13.069> starts<00:02:13.340> up<00:02:13.459> right

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
think so we'll see if it starts up right

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:14.430 
think so we'll see if it starts up right
here<00:02:13.849> now<00:02:14.030> or<00:02:14.150> not

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
here now or not

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.400 
here now or not
not<00:02:14.620> have<00:02:14.770> to<00:02:14.800> jumpstart<00:02:15.310> it<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.990> body<00:02:17.170> and

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
not have to jumpstart it the body and

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.140 
not have to jumpstart it the body and
it's<00:02:17.530> pretty<00:02:17.890> good<00:02:18.010> shape<00:02:18.280> for<00:02:18.460> what<00:02:18.640> it<00:02:18.760> is<00:02:18.790> I

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
it's pretty good shape for what it is I

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.090

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.180 
and we never bothered to fix it all we
did<00:02:51.970> was<00:02:52.150> just<00:02:52.210> let<00:02:52.930> it<00:02:53.050> run<00:02:53.230> dry<00:02:53.530> I<00:02:53.800> tried<00:02:54.160> a

to<00:03:47.340> basically<00:03:48.340> keep<00:03:48.519> the<00:03:48.670> RPMs<00:03:49.120> up<00:03:49.299> a<00:03:49.390> little

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
to basically keep the RPMs up a little

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.170 
to basically keep the RPMs up a little
higher<00:03:49.690> like<00:03:50.170> I<00:03:50.260> said<00:03:50.500> it<00:03:50.829> has<00:03:51.519> died<00:03:51.909> a<00:03:51.940> few

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
higher like I said it has died a few

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.699 
higher like I said it has died a few
times<00:03:52.239> but<00:03:52.629> it<00:03:52.720> starts<00:03:52.989> right<00:03:53.110> back<00:03:53.260> up<00:03:53.440> every

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
times but it starts right back up every

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.789 
times but it starts right back up every
time<00:03:55.049> other<00:03:56.049> than<00:03:56.200> that<00:03:56.379> don't<00:03:56.560> worry<00:03:56.709> know

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
time other than that don't worry know

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.140 
time other than that don't worry know
