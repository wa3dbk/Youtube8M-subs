 been designed 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.430
 a little things like that 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.110
 received and that is also interesting 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.580
 So personally for us for me to de 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.500
 a magazine works so the 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.780
 further that she worried the Russian 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.760
 Blasphemous shaving will bring further 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.050
 So that was interesting for me 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.310
 and for us editors it is too 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.280

 Family to identify with you 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.650

 Mr. Crown Junior looks like the children 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.160

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.160
 as an editor or journalist, too 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.990
 heart and they would be at one 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.700
 multinational corporations are not 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.160
 experience 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.870

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.530
 it was really interesting too 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.990
 yesterday this whole production way 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.540
 from expensive new shredders 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:47.210
 you could not just do that 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.070
 Production way, we also see 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:53.770
 people with professional people meet the 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:57.710
 crown concert hall our real 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:04:00.330
 really convincing and also surprising 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:02.610
 So thank you very much 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.000
 on marketing chief Heinrich drew because of 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.520
 a positive summary 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.380
 yes the conclusion from this event 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.020
 What I can draw there is the utmost 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.550
 positive for two reasons first 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.100
 because yesterday the presentation of our 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.739
 manufacturing and especially manufacturing 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.750
 the presentation of the new ones 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.910
 Testing facilities for our exler think 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.250
 I have the editors from the 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.410
 the whole world convinced we saw 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.460
 that we are benchmarkindex manufacturing 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.190
 that's one thing 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.110
 and what I still quite positive today 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.610
 found the circumstance that we are good 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.500
 We had weather that we had our machines 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.240
 could show in practice in practice 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.220
 because that's what the colleagues look like 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.470
 the whole world would like to see 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.120
 so my conclusion so well in 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.950
 At school I would say a two 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.550
 plus with asterisks and there you can completely 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.550
 be satisfied
