00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:09.210
 in this video I'll show you how 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:12.750
 a simple shawl pin that point 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:16.110
 launched starting from a few points ie 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:22.789
 starting from one end to the other and for 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:22.789
 first thing with two spikes two jerseys 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:38.629
 and began to work attach the 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.210
 trick in performing this type of 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:44.900
 of salt that I would be at this 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.970
 extremities increase only on one side 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.280
 and then to decrease 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.339
 now I'll let you see it logically on 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.519
 small sample but then based on 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:57.140
 schalke size and you want to do 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:01:00.769
 increase to the desired width e 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:04.610
 from then on you start to decrease then 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:08.960
 to do this point launched so far 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:11.960
 how you have to do do the right steps 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:17.390
 thread towards you as to work the 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:22.670
 backhand and make another right in 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:26.570
 this way you see you threw in 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:31.100
 backhand iron back works are 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:35.509
 the right and make the thrown fall 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:40.310
 work clothes and that will begin 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:42.499
 stretch your hands at the same time on the 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.170
 third round to direct you have to start 

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:51.399
 then do the increases you need to make me 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:57.499
 say on the thread and of this thread of the point 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:59.359
 he puts it on the iron he works right 

00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:06.549
 twisted so that you do not see at 

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:10.569
 file hole increases then pass the thread 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:13.610
 d'amore has the second jersey right 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:19.000
 here we have therefore thrown steps first 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.000
 the thread back to you works 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.709
 in the return iron you always have to 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:31.230
 working is the right the whole 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:37.650
 right and drop the thrown job 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:39.720
 in law the only foresight that binds 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:44.940
 it must logically increase 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:49.319
 always only on the side then what 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:52.140
 then shoot the film over it 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:56.310
 work has twisted right ie not 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:59.989
 taking it this way but this one 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:04.130
 to not do so as not to highlight 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:10.860
 the hole moves the thread towards me 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:15.330
 work your second thread is like this 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:20.280
 I create all these cast the iron of 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:24.560
 return always works and only the right 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.560
 it's thrown I do it for them 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:38.069
 slowly as you see we create let's go 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.980
 increase and create the tip then 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:47.310
 it depends on the desired width of yours 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:51.319
 shawl will have you can decide until that 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.319
 point to make increases 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:02.730
 this is a very simple system for 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:05.010
 do to make a shawl because a 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.860
 unlike the other technique you do 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:13.459
 by punctually or vice versa you are 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:13.459
 however always a few meshes we say 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.820
 work 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.830
 here 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:42.940
 when you have reached the width 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.690
 desired and you reduce points 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.880
 fi 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:49.450
 the operation has placed instead of 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.910
 increase one point each iron on 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:56.470
 labor law began to decline 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:05:00.450
 so this point passes it from the vote on 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:03.670
 next and on horseback 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.960
 then does the usual cast then exposed 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:09.390
 the wire 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.390
 the new right finally move 

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:22.779
 this type of shawl is very beautiful 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.069
 with one of the wool even when it is that 

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:30.249
 so it also gives them a little more 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:32.919
 softness then more more number maybe it is 

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:34.210
 the higher the number of the iron maybe you 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:35.889
 also gives an even more effect 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:41.439
 neglected 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:43.749
 in addition to the elongated mesh then of 

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:48.460
 new on labor law 

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:53.319
 pass point next job is a 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:58.919
 horse then premier a shirt a 

00:05:53.319 --> 00:06:01.919
 horse I make the thrown of won 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:01.919
 threw 

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:23.579
 the Czech of return as always I work 

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:25.979
 just a right I drop has 

00:06:23.579 --> 00:06:28.649
 thrown already predict that I'm 

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:30.509
 starting to give the tip effect 

00:06:28.649 --> 00:06:32.929
 now logically a little early 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:35.909
 sample to see the technique 

00:06:32.929 --> 00:06:38.819
 but if you started with two points you do 

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:44.449
 decreases until you reach 

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:44.449
 the same number of initial jerseys 

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:52.879
 so I do the lac endorsed at the beginning 

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:52.879
 to decrease the thrown mom 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:06.490
 in this way you can make a shawl 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:09.160
 small type scarves or barthus like 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:17.530
 is called or a shawl more 

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:20.260
 important longer so now we are 

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:23.460
 at the last step because I have precisely 

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:29.970
 I started with the step by step shirts 

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:29.970
 knit the horse I make in the city 

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:38.520
 it also did a close 

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:49.210
 it is in this case I find myself my two 

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:49.210
 mafia and for the last passage I close 

00:07:51.470 --> 00:08:00.700
 Pope 

00:07:52.720 --> 00:08:04.740
 enough as you can see we got it 

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:04.740
 shawl tip
