00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.360 

so<00:00:00.810> this<00:00:01.170> is<00:00:01.979> earth<00:00:03.650> most<00:00:04.650> people<00:00:04.950> think<00:00:05.130> earth

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
so this is earth most people think earth

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.810 
so this is earth most people think earth
is<00:00:05.609> pretty<00:00:05.879> big<00:00:06.120> and<00:00:06.589> a<00:00:07.589> lot<00:00:08.309> of<00:00:08.429> people<00:00:08.700> don't

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
is pretty big and a lot of people don't

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.700 
is pretty big and a lot of people don't
really<00:00:09.030> understand<00:00:10.700> where<00:00:11.700> earth<00:00:11.940> lies<00:00:12.710> not

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
really understand where earth lies not

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.670 
really understand where earth lies not
only<00:00:13.950> with<00:00:14.099> our<00:00:14.309> our<00:00:14.580> own<00:00:14.610> solar<00:00:15.240> system<00:00:15.680> but

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
only with our our own solar system but

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.560 
only with our our own solar system but
also<00:00:17.250> just<00:00:17.820> within<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.359> universe<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.279> then

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
also just within the universe and then

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.269 
also just within the universe and then
once<00:00:21.570> people<00:00:21.689> come<00:00:21.960> pre<00:00:22.230> comprehend<00:00:23.100> where

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
once people come pre comprehend where

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.210 
once people come pre comprehend where
earth<00:00:23.609> lies<00:00:24.150> within<00:00:24.510> our<00:00:24.720> universe<00:00:25.199> then<00:00:25.830> I

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
earth lies within our universe then I

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.890 
earth lies within our universe then I
don't<00:00:26.789> think<00:00:26.820> they<00:00:27.029> understand<00:00:27.570> where<00:00:27.779> our

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
don't think they understand where our

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.020 
don't think they understand where our
universe<00:00:28.080> lies<00:00:29.840> within<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:31.080> multiverse<00:00:32.030> now

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
universe lies within a multiverse now

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.340 
universe lies within a multiverse now
the<00:00:33.149> question<00:00:33.570> on<00:00:33.690> whether<00:00:33.840> or<00:00:34.140> not<00:00:34.230> a

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
the question on whether or not a

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.180 
the question on whether or not a
multiverse<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.610> actually<00:00:36.000> true<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.540> a

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
multiverse is actually true is a

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.700 
multiverse is actually true is a
impossible<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.340> test<00:00:38.610> but<00:00:39.540> uh<00:00:39.600> based<00:00:40.500> on

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
impossible to test but uh based on

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.810 
impossible to test but uh based on
science<00:00:41.219> it's<00:00:41.399> looking<00:00:41.840> highly<00:00:42.840> likely<00:00:43.820> so

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
science it's looking highly likely so

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.690 
science it's looking highly likely so
this<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.450> our<00:00:45.660> little<00:00:45.870> blue<00:00:46.170> bubble<00:00:46.710> make<00:00:47.520> this

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
this is our little blue bubble make this

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.389 
this is our little blue bubble make this
big<00:00:49.100> this<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.340> where<00:00:50.700> our<00:00:51.739> little<00:00:52.739> blue<00:00:52.949> bubble

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
big this is where our little blue bubble

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.799 
big this is where our little blue bubble
rest<00:00:54.920> within<00:00:55.920> our<00:00:56.340> solar<00:00:56.940> system<00:00:57.510> we<00:00:57.660> have

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
rest within our solar system we have

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.830 
rest within our solar system we have
earth<00:00:58.109> Mercury<00:00:58.829> Venus<00:00:59.070> Jupiter<00:00:59.550> Mars<00:01:00.379> the<00:01:01.379> Sun

earth Mercury Venus Jupiter Mars the Sun

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.230 
earth Mercury Venus Jupiter Mars the Sun
Uranus<00:01:03.840> Neptune<00:01:04.430> so<00:01:05.430> this<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.760> our<00:01:05.939> solar

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
Uranus Neptune so this is our solar

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.060 
Uranus Neptune so this is our solar
system<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:07.700> bubble<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:09.560> that<00:01:10.560> little<00:01:10.920> bubble

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
system this bubble is that little bubble

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.670 
system this bubble is that little bubble
right<00:01:11.250> there<00:01:12.320> the<00:01:13.320> solar<00:01:13.619> system<00:01:14.509> now<00:01:15.680> the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
right there the solar system now the

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.850 
right there the solar system now the
solar<00:01:17.009> system<00:01:18.740> rest<00:01:20.900> within<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.560> solar

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
solar system rest within the solar

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.109 
solar system rest within the solar
intercellular<00:01:24.020> neighborhood<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:26.119> this

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
intercellular neighborhood and this

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.270 
intercellular neighborhood and this
would<00:01:27.390> be<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:28.520> so<00:01:29.520> here's<00:01:30.030> our<00:01:30.240> solar<00:01:30.570> system

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
would be that so here's our solar system

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.240 
would be that so here's our solar system
within<00:01:32.280> our<00:01:32.939> inter<00:01:33.450> stellar<00:01:34.110> neighborhood<00:01:34.950> of

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
within our inter stellar neighborhood of

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.789 
within our inter stellar neighborhood of
solar<00:01:35.490> systems<00:01:36.979> so<00:01:37.979> we<00:01:38.130> got<00:01:38.509> this<00:01:39.509> thing<00:01:39.840> here

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
solar systems so we got this thing here

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.310 
solar systems so we got this thing here
and<00:01:41.000> we<00:01:42.000> got<00:01:42.180> all<00:01:42.329> these<00:01:42.630> are<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.930> ones<00:01:43.140> around

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
and we got all these are the ones around

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.210 
and we got all these are the ones around
it<00:01:45.560> yeah<00:01:46.560> it's<00:01:46.799> just<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:47.100> little<00:01:47.340> dot<00:01:48.409> but<00:01:49.409> it

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
it yeah it's just a little dot but it

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.460 
it yeah it's just a little dot but it
goes<00:01:50.970> further<00:01:52.729> our<00:01:53.729> solar<00:01:54.659> intercellular

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
goes further our solar intercellular

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.810 
goes further our solar intercellular
neighborhood<00:01:56.479> which<00:01:57.479> we<00:01:57.659> call<00:01:57.869> solar<00:01:58.200> system

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820

rest<00:01:59.820> within<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.509> Milky<00:02:00.750> Way<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.610> yes<00:02:02.840> you've

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
rest within the Milky Way and yes you've

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.010 
rest within the Milky Way and yes you've
all<00:02:04.020> heard<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.409> Milky<00:02:04.799> Way<00:02:05.390> this<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:06.659> where

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
all heard of the Milky Way this is where

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.690 
all heard of the Milky Way this is where
our<00:02:07.049> little<00:02:07.500> solar<00:02:07.890> interstellar

a<00:02:11.150> little<00:02:12.150> speck

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
a little speck

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.450 
a little speck
