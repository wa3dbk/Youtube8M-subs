00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.210
 good evening marriage friends today 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.670
 thanks for the pass of raÃºl and tula 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.800
 continuing with the topic of breastfeeding 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.690
 maternally we are going to talk today about what is 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.700
 the extraction of breast milk when 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.559
 there is not a baby sucking 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.809
 we have to extract that breast milk 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.129
 for that we are going to use different 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.050
 accessories that exist in the market 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.480
 how are the milk extractors 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.580
 maternal among them that we have those of 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.400
 lever or also called mechanical 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.320
 and there are also the electrical ones these are 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.640
 the most suitable since those of light bulb 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.129
 or those who use heaven are not 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.840
 suitable for keeping milk 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.330
 maternal to store it because they have 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.759
 to be discarded the correct position 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.370
 to use an electric extractor 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:15.400
 or manual is to place the vacuum 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.800
 the whole part of the mom inside the 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.160
 dome or hood of the extractor and 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:24.790
 just manipulate the bell or the 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:28.090
 lever to extract breast milk from 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.810
 this way when we do not have access to 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.540
 this kind of accessories 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.640
 we can easily use the five 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.320
 fingers of our hands for that there 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.630
 all a technique the first thing that we should 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.689
 do is massage the breasts we can 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.439
 use the knuckles of the fingers 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:45.439
 around the whole breast 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:52.210
 to prepare it how to go dissolving those 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.190
 accumulations of milk that are forming and 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.250
 solidifying around the breast all 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:00.190
 it's from outside to inside from outside 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.750
 towards the weight the whole circle of the breast 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.050
 without fear it is as if they were 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.790
 really massaging kneading to be able 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.250
 dissolve all these nodules that are 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.710
 there is a way to do it 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.800
 way they can lean forward 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.540
 join both breasts and release them as 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.910
 causing those too to move 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.380
 ducts that are filled with milk 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.210
 now the technique to be extracted 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.920
 manually in breast milk is the 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.320
 next they remember when we talk about 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.940
 correct postures I learned from the baby at 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.950
 chest 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.840
 we spoke an arc in se with the fingers 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.180
 that is also a tree with the 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.430
 except that no approach was not holed 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.210
 totally the mom in the arch but 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.310
 just in the areola in the viola 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.680
 strings that lario is the whole part 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.330
 darkened around the nipple we're going to 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.020
 place the big toe and the index finger 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:52.150
 I do not fill this arch only what I 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.560
 acerco lario I put the fingers 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.709
 first movement that I'm going to make is 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:00.459
 push the whole viola towards the 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:02.860
 ribs towards the mother's breast close 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:07.750
 fingers as fingers together and 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:09.909
 stretch outward I approach together and 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.939
 stretched out that's the way 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:15.760
 extract and make the erection the output of 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:18.310
 breast milk I did not decide only the 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.510
 fingers on the breast did not slide the fingers 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.560
 about the nipple because that way 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:26.800
 would be causing it to close or 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.500
 could hurt the part of the mom deal 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.360
 it is again inward together 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.010
 the fingers and out is the way 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.110
 correct to do manual removal 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.510
 of good breast milk friends of 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.700
 marriage today we end up with this 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.530
 segment of lullabies and breasts for tonight 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.970
 and we'll see you soon in the 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:59.610
