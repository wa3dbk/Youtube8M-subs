00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
consoles are not consoles running a game

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.539 
consoles are not consoles running a game
and<00:03:49.989> is<00:03:50.590> pretty<00:03:50.979> much<00:03:51.069> equipments<00:03:51.519> running

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
and is pretty much equipments running

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.759 
and is pretty much equipments running
the<00:03:51.819> same<00:03:51.970> game<00:03:52.180> on<00:03:52.299> a<00:03:52.329> PC<00:03:52.659> on<00:03:52.750> above<00:03:52.959> medium<00:03:53.319> so

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
the same game on a PC on above medium so

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.289 
the same game on a PC on above medium so
if<00:03:53.889> you<00:03:53.979> think<00:03:54.159> about<00:03:54.189> it<00:03:54.370> that<00:03:54.459> way<00:03:54.729> there's<00:03:55.209> a

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
if you think about it that way there's a

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.179 
if you think about it that way there's a
huge<00:03:55.540> difference<00:03:55.689> in<00:03:55.989> medium<00:03:56.319> and<00:03:56.500> high<00:03:56.979> or

00:03:57.179 --> 00:03:57.189 
huge difference in medium and high or

00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:59.280 
huge difference in medium and high or
ultra<00:03:57.609> so<00:03:58.150> it's<00:03:58.719> going<00:03:58.870> to<00:03:58.930> be<00:03:58.989> a<00:03:59.019> lot<00:03:59.229> better

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
ultra so it's going to be a lot better

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.170 
ultra so it's going to be a lot better
looking<00:03:59.799> on<00:04:00.099> a<00:04:00.129> console<00:04:00.549> it's<00:04:00.699> just<00:04:00.879> it's<00:04:01.060> just

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
looking on a console it's just it's just

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.699 
looking on a console it's just it's just
designed<00:04:01.659> and<00:04:01.870> more<00:04:01.959> optimized<00:04:02.379> for<00:04:02.409> the

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
designed and more optimized for the

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.649 
designed and more optimized for the
high-end<00:04:03.009> graphics<00:04:03.189> the<00:04:03.939> other<00:04:04.090> thing<00:04:04.329> I<00:04:04.419> like

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:04.659 
high-end graphics the other thing I like

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:06.179 
high-end graphics the other thing I like
to<00:04:04.689> argue<00:04:04.900> about<00:04:05.049> with<00:04:05.229> the<00:04:05.319> pc<00:04:05.680> is<00:04:05.859> that<00:04:06.099> it

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:06.189 
to argue about with the pc is that it

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:08.129 
to argue about with the pc is that it
doubles<00:04:06.549> as<00:04:06.609> a<00:04:06.759> personal<00:04:07.389> computer<00:04:07.539> not<00:04:07.930> only

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139 
doubles as a personal computer not only

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:09.569 
doubles as a personal computer not only

take pictures you know Skype everything
in<00:04:31.450> one<00:04:31.630> device<00:04:31.780> I<00:04:32.170> think<00:04:32.470> it<00:04:32.560> should<00:04:32.650> be<00:04:32.770> the

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
in one device I think it should be the

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.670 
in one device I think it should be the
same<00:04:33.040> for<00:04:33.550> you<00:04:34.450> know<00:04:34.540> for<00:04:34.750> gaming<00:04:35.110> you<00:04:35.590> know

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
same for you know for gaming you know

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.440 
same for you know for gaming you know
you<00:04:35.920> can<00:04:36.040> put<00:04:36.490> all<00:04:36.640> the<00:04:36.730> gaming<00:04:37.030> components<00:04:37.390> in

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
you can put all the gaming components in

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:38.820 
you can put all the gaming components in
a<00:04:37.510> computer<00:04:37.840> but<00:04:37.960> still<00:04:38.230> surf<00:04:38.440> the<00:04:38.560> internet

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
a computer but still surf the internet

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.200 
a computer but still surf the internet
do<00:04:38.980> the<00:04:39.100> generic<00:04:39.430> things<00:04:39.610> but<00:04:39.820> at<00:04:39.940> the<00:04:40.060> same

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
do the generic things but at the same

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.460 
do the generic things but at the same
time<00:04:40.360> you<00:04:40.540> can<00:04:40.660> turn<00:04:40.810> on<00:04:40.900> a<00:04:40.930> game<00:04:41.140> and<00:04:41.350> have<00:04:41.440> a

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
time you can turn on a game and have a

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.690 
time you can turn on a game and have a
lot<00:04:41.590> of<00:04:41.650> fun<00:04:41.890> gaming<00:04:42.130> so<00:04:42.370> it's<00:04:42.520> kind<00:04:42.670> of

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
lot of fun gaming so it's kind of

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.210 
lot of fun gaming so it's kind of
everything<00:04:43.090> in<00:04:43.180> one<00:04:43.360> that's<00:04:43.840> my<00:04:43.990> biggest

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
everything in one that's my biggest

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.680 
everything in one that's my biggest
argument<00:04:45.220> when<00:04:45.340> I<00:04:45.370> try<00:04:45.610> to<00:04:45.640> argue<00:04:45.820> computers

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
argument when I try to argue computers

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.840 
argument when I try to argue computers
over<00:04:46.930> consoles<00:04:47.440> and<00:04:47.620> that's<00:04:48.310> you<00:04:48.550> know<00:04:48.640> when

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
over consoles and that's you know when

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.940 
over consoles and that's you know when
there's<00:04:49.450> advantages<00:04:49.810> to<00:04:49.930> both<00:04:50.080> but<00:04:50.440> I<00:04:50.650> think

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
there's advantages to both but I think

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.400 
there's advantages to both but I think
that's<00:04:51.130> one<00:04:51.430> of<00:04:51.460> the<00:04:51.550> big<00:04:51.730> advantages<00:04:52.320> so<00:04:53.320> now

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
that's one of the big advantages so now

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.260 
that's one of the big advantages so now
we<00:04:53.470> have<00:04:53.590> to<00:04:53.800> decide<00:04:53.890> which<00:04:54.340> is<00:04:54.370> better<00:04:54.910> for

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
we have to decide which is better for

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.180 
we have to decide which is better for
you<00:04:55.630> and<00:04:55.660> better<00:04:56.110> for<00:04:56.350> me<00:04:56.530> and<00:04:56.770> it<00:04:57.160> really

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
you and better for me and it really

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.830 
you and better for me and it really
depends<00:04:57.790> on<00:04:57.880> what<00:04:57.940> you're<00:04:58.300> looking<00:04:58.600> for<00:04:58.720> if

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
depends on what you're looking for if

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.300 
depends on what you're looking for if
you're<00:04:58.960> looking<00:04:59.170> for<00:04:59.200> longevity<00:04:59.500> you're

you're looking for longevity you're

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.620 
you're looking for longevity you're
going<00:05:00.490> to<00:05:00.550> find<00:05:00.790> it<00:05:00.940> probably<00:05:01.360> more<00:05:01.510> in<00:05:01.570> a
