00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
how's it going everyone mentioned with

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.409 
how's it going everyone mentioned with
another<00:00:02.040> tips<00:00:02.370> and<00:00:02.550> tricks<00:00:02.850> video<00:00:03.149> this<00:00:03.360> is

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
another tips and tricks video this is

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.749 
another tips and tricks video this is
number<00:00:03.990> 10<00:00:04.319> and<00:00:04.710> I'm<00:00:05.009> going<00:00:05.370> to<00:00:05.460> be<00:00:05.580> talking

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
number 10 and I'm going to be talking

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.200 
number 10 and I'm going to be talking
about<00:00:06.150> how<00:00:06.390> to<00:00:06.450> maintain<00:00:06.930> your<00:00:07.859> CPU<00:00:08.490> so<00:00:09.059> that

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
about how to maintain your CPU so that

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.240 
about how to maintain your CPU so that
you<00:00:09.389> aren't<00:00:09.599> bottoming<00:00:10.230> out<00:00:10.410> that<00:00:10.620> CPU<00:00:11.010> all

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
you aren't bottoming out that CPU all

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.150 
you aren't bottoming out that CPU all
the<00:00:11.400> time<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:12.049> crushing<00:00:13.049> logic<00:00:13.500> that's<00:00:14.009> not

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
the time and crushing logic that's not

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.060 
the time and crushing logic that's not
good<00:00:14.460> obviously<00:00:14.700> not<00:00:15.210> at<00:00:15.450> all<00:00:15.750> so<00:00:16.440> my<00:00:16.830> first

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
good obviously not at all so my first

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.800 
good obviously not at all so my first
tip<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.670> thing<00:00:18.029> that<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.240> want<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.510> get<00:00:18.600> across

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
tip and thing that I want to get across

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.140 
tip and thing that I want to get across
to<00:00:18.960> you<00:00:19.020> first<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:19.560> that<00:00:19.740> if<00:00:20.730> you<00:00:20.910> are<00:00:21.029> working

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
to you first is that if you are working

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.170 
to you first is that if you are working
with<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.480> highly<00:00:22.050> midi<00:00:22.350> song<00:00:22.939> something<00:00:23.939> that

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
with a highly midi song something that

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.880 
with a highly midi song something that
has<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.390> lot<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.840> software<00:00:25.170> instruments<00:00:25.650> and

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
has a lot of software instruments and

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.349 
has a lot of software instruments and
sometimes<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:26.609> know<00:00:26.730> all<00:00:26.880> those<00:00:27.000> software

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
sometimes you know all those software

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.120 
sometimes you know all those software
instruments<00:00:27.810> might<00:00:28.109> be<00:00:28.230> playing<00:00:28.560> at<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.769> same

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
instruments might be playing at the same

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.269 
instruments might be playing at the same
time<00:00:29.519> this<00:00:30.269> means<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.840> all<00:00:31.109> your<00:00:31.500> your<00:00:31.800> CPU

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
time this means that all your your CPU

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.060 
time this means that all your your CPU
needs<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.880> work<00:00:33.600> extra<00:00:34.290> hard<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.680> make<00:00:34.920> sure

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
needs to work extra hard to make sure

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.650 
needs to work extra hard to make sure
all<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.430> these<00:00:35.670> software<00:00:36.030> instruments<00:00:36.540> are

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
all of these software instruments are

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.860 
all of these software instruments are
playing<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:38.149> sometimes<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.300> can<00:00:39.360> cause<00:00:39.660> the

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
playing and sometimes that can cause the

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.660 
playing and sometimes that can cause the
CPU<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.500> crash<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.640> overload<00:00:42.480> alright<00:00:43.489> so<00:00:44.489> how

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
CPU to crash and overload alright so how

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.069 
CPU to crash and overload alright so how
do<00:00:44.730> we<00:00:44.879> combat<00:00:45.210> this<00:00:45.360> how<00:00:45.539> do<00:00:45.600> we<00:00:45.629> get<00:00:45.809> past

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
do we combat this how do we get past

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.910 
do we combat this how do we get past
this<00:00:46.379> my<00:00:47.280> initial<00:00:47.730> idea<00:00:48.379> and<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.680> one<00:00:49.800> that

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
this my initial idea and the one that

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.889 
this my initial idea and the one that
I've<00:00:50.039> been<00:00:50.070> using<00:00:50.340> for<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.700> very<00:00:51.059> long<00:00:51.239> time<00:00:51.270> is

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
I've been using for a very long time is

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.779 
I've been using for a very long time is
to<00:00:52.170> take<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.559> track<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.070> bounce<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.610> an

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
to take the track and bounce it to an

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.670 
to take the track and bounce it to an
audio<00:00:54.090> file<00:00:54.360> then<00:00:54.750> delete<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.199> old<00:00:55.230> track

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
audio file then delete the old track

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.319 
audio file then delete the old track
this<00:00:56.190> does<00:00:56.460> pose<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.730> couple<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.120> problems

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
this does pose a couple of problems

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.229 
this does pose a couple of problems
though<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.879> can't<00:01:00.090> go

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
though and that is that you can't go

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.939 
though and that is that you can't go
back<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.629> MIDI<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:01.050> MIDI<00:01:01.379> file<00:01:01.590> change

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
back to the MIDI of a MIDI file change

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.380 
back to the MIDI of a MIDI file change
the<00:01:02.160> notes<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.670> can't<00:01:02.879> go<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.180> software

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
the notes you can't go to the software

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.870 
the notes you can't go to the software
instrument<00:01:03.960> change<00:01:04.769> what<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.129> sound<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.640> that

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
instrument change what the sound is that

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.570 
instrument change what the sound is that
these<00:01:06.360> many<00:01:07.200> notes<00:01:07.380> are<00:01:07.530> pointing<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.040> you

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
these many notes are pointing to you

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.640 
these many notes are pointing to you
just<00:01:08.880> can't<00:01:09.390> go<00:01:09.510> back<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.720> edit<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.200> at<00:01:10.350> all

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
just can't go back and edit it at all

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.880 
just can't go back and edit it at all
and<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:12.150> pretty<00:01:12.600> big<00:01:12.689> problem<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.619> I

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
and that is a pretty big problem so I

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.070 
and that is a pretty big problem so I
found<00:01:14.250> another<00:01:14.729> cool<00:01:15.119> feature<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:15.600> logic<00:01:15.930> it

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
found another cool feature in logic it

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.050 
found another cool feature in logic it
is<00:01:16.110> called<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.590> freeze<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.220> if<00:01:17.909> you

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
is called the freeze and if you

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.080 
is called the freeze and if you
right-click<00:01:18.750> on<00:01:19.170> your<00:01:19.200> track<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.890> can<00:01:20.460> select

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
right-click on your track you can select

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.120 
right-click on your track you can select
the<00:01:21.330> freeze<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:22.350> what<00:01:22.470> happens<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.890> there's<00:01:22.979> a

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
the freeze and what happens is there's a

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.670 
the freeze and what happens is there's a
snowflake<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:24.060> comes<00:01:24.299> up<00:01:24.479> on<00:01:24.659> all<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.530> your

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
snowflake that comes up on all of your

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.249 
snowflake that comes up on all of your
tracks<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.310> main<00:01:26.520> window<00:01:26.729> now<00:01:27.450> what<00:01:28.049> does

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
tracks in the main window now what does

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.440 
tracks in the main window now what does
this<00:01:28.409> do<00:01:28.650> if<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.400> have<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.610> MIDI<00:01:29.880> track<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.210> you

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
this do if you have a MIDI track and you

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.020 
this do if you have a MIDI track and you
freeze<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:31.220> what<00:01:32.220> that's<00:01:32.430> going<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.640> do<00:01:32.820> is

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
freeze it what that's going to do is

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.200 
freeze it what that's going to do is
it's<00:01:33.270> going<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.540> take<00:01:34.159> the<00:01:35.159> it's<00:01:36.030> going<00:01:36.150> to

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
it's going to take the it's going to

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.240 
it's going to take the it's going to
take<00:01:36.390> all<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.570> your<00:01:36.689> MIDI<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.170> your<00:01:37.890> software

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
take all of your MIDI and your software

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.920 
take all of your MIDI and your software
instrument<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.790> it's<00:01:39.180> going<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.390> convert<00:01:39.750> the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
instrument and it's going to convert the

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.590 
instrument and it's going to convert the
sounds<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.590> it's<00:01:40.740> playing<00:01:41.280> into<00:01:42.060> an<00:01:42.210> audio

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
sounds that it's playing into an audio

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.230 
sounds that it's playing into an audio

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
help with the CPU a ton all right but

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.740 
help with the CPU a ton all right but
there<00:01:52.649> is<00:01:52.829> one<00:01:53.310> downside<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.540> that

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
there is one downside to that and that

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.370 
there is one downside to that and that
is<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.380> can't<00:01:55.649> edit<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.159> MIDI<00:01:56.280> file<00:01:56.700> or

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
is that you can't edit the MIDI file or

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.740 
is that you can't edit the MIDI file or
anything<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.649> matter<00:01:59.149> because<00:02:00.149> there

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
anything of that matter because there

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.929 
anything of that matter because there
you<00:02:00.869> go<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.229> will<00:02:01.259> say<00:02:01.560> checkers<00:02:02.490> truck<00:02:02.790> is

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
you go it will say checkers truck is

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.670 
you go it will say checkers truck is

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.469

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
like to unfreeze it and so you can

like to unfreeze it and so you can
unfreeze<00:02:06.930> it<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.320> then<00:02:07.469> you<00:02:07.590> can<00:02:07.740> move<00:02:07.950> all

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
unfreeze it and then you can move all

pretty annoying pretty quickly so if you

because that will piss you off so that

because that will piss you off so that
is<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:37.030> first<00:02:37.450> tip<00:02:37.959> second<00:02:38.709> tip<00:02:38.860> is<00:02:38.980> reverb<00:02:39.880> if

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
you are using the space designer which I

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.110 
you are using the space designer which I
highly<00:02:43.840> suggest<00:02:44.200> you<00:02:44.560> use<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:45.370> best<00:02:45.610> reverb

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
highly suggest you use the best reverb

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.610 
highly suggest you use the best reverb
inside<00:02:47.110> of<00:02:47.230> logic<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:49.230> reverb<00:02:50.230> space

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.949 
inside of logic the reverb space
designer<00:02:50.980> is<00:02:51.250> a<00:02:51.280> highly<00:02:51.850> CPU<00:02:52.540> intensive

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
designer is a highly CPU intensive

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.040 
designer is a highly CPU intensive
plugin<00:02:53.830> and<00:02:54.010> if<00:02:54.519> you<00:02:54.670> have<00:02:54.910> that<00:02:55.209> plug-in<00:02:55.540> set

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
plugin and if you have that plug-in set

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.960 
plugin and if you have that plug-in set
on<00:02:56.290> a<00:02:56.530> million<00:02:57.100> different<00:02:57.430> tracks<00:02:57.670> and

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
playing all at the same time that is a

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.580 
playing all at the same time that is a
lot<00:03:00.459> of<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:01.150> CPU<00:03:01.600> that<00:03:01.630> is<00:03:01.780> taken<00:03:02.230> up<00:03:02.380> by<00:03:02.410> this

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
lot of the CPU that is taken up by this

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.800 
lot of the CPU that is taken up by this
one<00:03:02.680> plug-in<00:03:03.220> just<00:03:03.519> many<00:03:03.910> iterations<00:03:04.120> of<00:03:04.660> it

one plug-in just many iterations of it
so<00:03:05.410> what<00:03:05.800> you<00:03:05.890> can<00:03:06.069> do<00:03:06.220> to<00:03:06.370> combat<00:03:06.489> this<00:03:06.910> is<00:03:07.269> if

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
so what you can do to combat this is if

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.920 
so what you can do to combat this is if
you<00:03:07.630> have<00:03:07.870> a<00:03:08.170> bunch<00:03:08.500> of<00:03:08.709> tracks<00:03:09.370> that<00:03:10.060> all<00:03:10.480> have

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.420 
space designer plug-in on it and all
these<00:03:42.519> tracks<00:03:42.820> will<00:03:43.209> have<00:03:43.799> this<00:03:44.799> reverb<00:03:45.190> on

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
these tracks will have this reverb on

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.400 
these tracks will have this reverb on
them<00:03:45.700> and<00:03:45.940> all<00:03:46.600> it<00:03:46.720> is<00:03:46.780> is<00:03:46.840> just<00:03:46.959> going<00:03:47.230> to<00:03:47.320> be

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
them and all it is is just going to be

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.319 
them and all it is is just going to be
pushing<00:03:47.859> all<00:03:48.070> these<00:03:48.280> tracks<00:03:48.519> to<00:03:48.730> the<00:03:48.850> single

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
pushing all these tracks to the single

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.949 
pushing all these tracks to the single
place<00:03:50.290> and<00:03:50.620> then<00:03:50.920> adding<00:03:51.220> reverb<00:03:51.400> onto<00:03:51.880> it<00:03:52.000> the

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
place and then adding reverb onto it the

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.380 
place and then adding reverb onto it the
only<00:03:53.140> problem<00:03:53.230> with<00:03:53.680> this<00:03:53.859> is<00:03:54.130> that<00:03:54.760> since<00:03:55.180> all

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
only problem with this is that since all

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.330 
only problem with this is that since all
these<00:03:55.600> tracks<00:03:55.930> are<00:03:56.140> being<00:03:56.350> sent<00:03:56.650> to<00:03:56.739> this<00:03:56.980> one

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
these tracks are being sent to this one

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.789 
these tracks are being sent to this one
place<00:03:57.760> you<00:03:58.600> need<00:03:58.780> to<00:03:58.900> be<00:03:59.019> careful<00:03:59.230> with<00:03:59.590> the

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
place you need to be careful with the

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.069 
place you need to be careful with the
volume<00:04:00.250> that<00:04:00.670> is<00:04:00.970> coming<00:04:01.299> out<00:04:01.600> of<00:04:01.900> this

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
volume that is coming out of this

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.050 
volume that is coming out of this
auxiliary<00:04:02.290> track<00:04:02.620> because<00:04:03.459> it<00:04:03.700> could<00:04:03.910> be

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
auxiliary track because it could be

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.670 
auxiliary track because it could be
quite<00:04:04.750> a<00:04:04.780> bit<00:04:05.140> and<00:04:05.940> so<00:04:06.940> you<00:04:07.000> might<00:04:07.209> have<00:04:07.390> to

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
quite a bit and so you might have to

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.990 
quite a bit and so you might have to
mess<00:04:08.680> with<00:04:08.799> the<00:04:08.950> volume<00:04:09.250> fader<00:04:09.430> just<00:04:09.760> to<00:04:09.850> get

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
mess with the volume fader just to get

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.390 
mess with the volume fader just to get
it<00:04:10.120> perfectly<00:04:10.510> and<00:04:10.780> also<00:04:11.620> another<00:04:12.190> way<00:04:12.340> to

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
it perfectly and also another way to

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.750 
it perfectly and also another way to
combat<00:04:12.730> this<00:04:12.880> is<00:04:13.180> to<00:04:13.950> make<00:04:14.950> sure<00:04:15.100> you<00:04:15.250> have<00:04:15.430> low

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
combat this is to make sure you have low

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.120 
combat this is to make sure you have low
sends<00:04:16.359> with<00:04:16.810> the<00:04:16.930> amounts<00:04:17.289> of<00:04:17.440> the<00:04:17.829> track<00:04:18.010> that

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
sends with the amounts of the track that

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.370 
sends with the amounts of the track that
you<00:04:18.220> send<00:04:18.489> to<00:04:18.640> it<00:04:18.789> have<00:04:19.510> it<00:04:19.630> relatively<00:04:20.019> low

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
you send to it have it relatively low

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.100 
you send to it have it relatively low
you<00:04:20.769> don't<00:04:20.919> really<00:04:21.039> need<00:04:21.220> too<00:04:21.459> much<00:04:21.640> on<00:04:21.849> it<00:04:22.110> but

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
you don't really need too much on it but

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.589 
you don't really need too much on it but
yeah<00:04:23.320> just<00:04:23.740> group<00:04:24.370> all<00:04:24.640> the<00:04:25.030> tracks<00:04:25.270> that<00:04:25.390> have

00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:25.599 
yeah just group all the tracks that have

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:27.150 
yeah just group all the tracks that have
the<00:04:25.690> same<00:04:25.870> reverb<00:04:26.260> in<00:04:26.409> them<00:04:26.560> and

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
the same reverb in them and

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.400 
the same reverb in them and
send<00:04:27.400> it<00:04:27.490> to<00:04:27.520> a<00:04:27.640> bus<00:04:27.880> and<00:04:28.150> use<00:04:28.420> just<00:04:28.720> one<00:04:29.020> single

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
send it to a bus and use just one single

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.800 
send it to a bus and use just one single
reverb<00:04:29.920> and<00:04:30.160> that<00:04:30.730> will<00:04:30.910> also<00:04:31.150> help<00:04:31.450> with<00:04:31.540> your

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
reverb and that will also help with your

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.710 
reverb and that will also help with your
CPU<00:04:32.290> all<00:04:33.130> right<00:04:33.610> already

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
CPU all right already

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.290 
CPU all right already
Oh<00:04:34.870> ready<00:04:35.590> no<00:04:36.390> the<00:04:37.390> last<00:04:37.570> thing<00:04:38.400> oh<00:04:39.400> I'm<00:04:40.120> going

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
Oh ready no the last thing oh I'm going

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.450 
Oh ready no the last thing oh I'm going
to<00:04:40.330> talk<00:04:40.450> about<00:04:40.480> latency<00:04:40.960> very<00:04:41.440> quickly<00:04:41.740> now

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
to talk about latency very quickly now

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.290 
to talk about latency very quickly now
latency<00:04:44.220> there's<00:04:45.220> a<00:04:45.520> few<00:04:45.850> things<00:04:46.060> that<00:04:46.210> go

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
latency there's a few things that go

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.670 
latency there's a few things that go
into<00:04:46.480> it<00:04:46.600> if<00:04:46.780> you<00:04:46.810> go<00:04:46.960> into<00:04:47.110> your<00:04:47.410> preferences

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
into it if you go into your preferences

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.860 
into it if you go into your preferences
and<00:04:48.010> then<00:04:48.280> into<00:04:48.490> your<00:04:48.610> audio<00:04:48.970> you<00:04:49.540> can<00:04:49.570> see

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
and then into your audio you can see

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.770 
and then into your audio you can see
that<00:04:50.050> we<00:04:50.140> have<00:04:50.320> a<00:04:50.350> buffer<00:04:51.040> size<00:04:51.570> buffer<00:04:52.570> size

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
that we have a buffer size buffer size

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.870 
that we have a buffer size buffer size
and<00:04:53.020> they<00:04:53.200> see<00:04:53.650> correspond<00:04:54.310> to<00:04:54.460> each<00:04:54.640> other

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
and they see correspond to each other

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.700 
and they see correspond to each other
all<00:04:55.450> right<00:04:55.510> so<00:04:55.840> let<00:04:56.170> me<00:04:56.200> talk<00:04:56.380> about<00:04:56.410> this<00:04:56.650> a

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
all right so let me talk about this a

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.560 
all right so let me talk about this a
little<00:04:56.800> bit<00:04:56.920> latency<00:04:57.760> what<00:04:58.030> is<00:04:58.120> latency

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
little bit latency what is latency

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.090 
little bit latency what is latency
latency<00:04:58.720> is<00:04:59.200> if<00:04:59.440> you're<00:04:59.560> talking<00:04:59.890> into<00:05:00.010> a

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
latency is if you're talking into a

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.780 
latency is if you're talking into a
microphone

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
microphone

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.100 
microphone
it's<00:05:01.150> the<00:05:01.420> delay<00:05:01.870> that<00:05:02.170> is<00:05:03.660> when<00:05:04.660> when<00:05:04.990> the

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
it's the delay that is when when the

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.930 
it's the delay that is when when the
computer<00:05:05.500> records<00:05:05.830> the<00:05:06.130> actual<00:05:06.400> audio<00:05:06.520> from

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
computer records the actual audio from

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.140 
computer records the actual audio from
the<00:05:07.090> microphone<00:05:07.590> the<00:05:08.590> time<00:05:09.370> in<00:05:09.550> between<00:05:09.700> those

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
the microphone the time in between those

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.360 
the microphone the time in between those
two<00:05:10.390> things<00:05:10.720> is<00:05:10.990> called<00:05:11.590> the<00:05:11.770> latency<00:05:12.190> and

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
two things is called the latency and

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.000 
two things is called the latency and
sometimes<00:05:13.030> this<00:05:13.210> gets<00:05:13.390> to<00:05:13.600> be<00:05:13.720> quite<00:05:14.050> a<00:05:14.410> bit

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
sometimes this gets to be quite a bit

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:16.890 
sometimes this gets to be quite a bit
and<00:05:15.310> it<00:05:15.580> gets<00:05:15.730> annoying<00:05:15.970> especially<00:05:16.390> if<00:05:16.810> you

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
and it gets annoying especially if you

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.230 
and it gets annoying especially if you
have<00:05:17.020> to<00:05:17.140> listen<00:05:17.440> to<00:05:17.530> the<00:05:17.650> song<00:05:17.860> and<00:05:18.130> you

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
have to listen to the song and you

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.060 
have to listen to the song and you
singing<00:05:19.240> or<00:05:19.450> you<00:05:19.930> know<00:05:20.050> doing<00:05:20.590> whatever<00:05:20.770> into

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
singing or you know doing whatever into

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.940 
singing or you know doing whatever into
the<00:05:21.160> microphone<00:05:21.900> it<00:05:22.900> gets<00:05:23.140> very<00:05:23.230> annoying<00:05:23.740> and

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
the microphone it gets very annoying and

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.310 
the microphone it gets very annoying and
it<00:05:24.100> can<00:05:24.340> mess<00:05:25.210> you<00:05:25.330> up<00:05:25.390> quite<00:05:25.750> a<00:05:25.810> bit<00:05:26.020> in<00:05:26.170> this

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
it can mess you up quite a bit in this

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.690 
it can mess you up quite a bit in this
house<00:05:26.470> so<00:05:26.650> happens<00:05:26.890> with<00:05:27.040> MIDI<00:05:27.280> with<00:05:27.490> MIDI

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 
house so happens with MIDI with MIDI

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.480 
house so happens with MIDI with MIDI
keyboards<00:05:28.150> and<00:05:28.270> whatever<00:05:28.510> so<00:05:29.260> if<00:05:29.560> you<00:05:29.830> want<00:05:30.310> if

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
keyboards and whatever so if you want if

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.640 
keyboards and whatever so if you want if
you<00:05:30.700> want<00:05:30.880> to<00:05:30.940> get<00:05:31.090> rid<00:05:31.270> of<00:05:31.300> this<00:05:31.600> latency<00:05:32.290> you

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
you want to get rid of this latency you

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.580 
you want to get rid of this latency you
need<00:05:32.890> to<00:05:33.070> decrease<00:05:33.580> the<00:05:33.790> buffer<00:05:34.120> size

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
need to decrease the buffer size

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.140 
need to decrease the buffer size
decreasing<00:05:35.590> the<00:05:35.710> buffer<00:05:35.980> size<00:05:36.160> will<00:05:36.490> increase

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
decreasing the buffer size will increase

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.680 
decreasing the buffer size will increase
the<00:05:37.480> amount<00:05:37.810> of<00:05:37.930> CPU<00:05:38.170> that<00:05:39.100> you<00:05:39.310> are<00:05:39.580> using<00:05:39.910> so

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
the amount of CPU that you are using so

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.630 
the amount of CPU that you are using so
there's<00:05:40.900> a<00:05:40.960> fine<00:05:41.290> line<00:05:41.350> between<00:05:41.590> the<00:05:42.340> buffer

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
there's a fine line between the buffer

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.390 
there's a fine line between the buffer
size<00:05:42.790> latency<00:05:43.450> and<00:05:43.660> CPU<00:05:44.110> usage<00:05:44.620> and<00:05:44.830> you<00:05:45.220> need

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
size latency and CPU usage and you need

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.040 
size latency and CPU usage and you need
to<00:05:45.580> find<00:05:45.820> the<00:05:46.000> point<00:05:46.240> at<00:05:46.419> which<00:05:46.600> this<00:05:46.810> works

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
to find the point at which this works

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.680 
to find the point at which this works
out<00:05:47.230> perfectly<00:05:48.060> sometimes<00:05:49.060> it<00:05:49.360> won't

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
out perfectly sometimes it won't

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.659 
out perfectly sometimes it won't
sometimes<00:05:50.380> you<00:05:50.740> will<00:05:50.950> have<00:05:51.100> to<00:05:51.190> have<00:05:51.310> a<00:05:51.340> delay

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
sometimes you will have to have a delay

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:53.970 
sometimes you will have to have a delay
latency<00:05:52.150> if<00:05:52.300> your<00:05:52.480> computer<00:05:52.900> doesn't<00:05:53.740> have

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:53.980 
latency if your computer doesn't have

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.100 
latency if your computer doesn't have
enough<00:05:54.250> CPU<00:05:54.730> to<00:05:54.880> get<00:05:55.030> through<00:05:55.300> it<00:05:55.450> and<00:05:55.600> at<00:05:56.050> that

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
enough CPU to get through it and at that

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.570 
enough CPU to get through it and at that
point<00:05:56.380> you<00:05:56.620> might<00:05:56.710> have<00:05:56.890> to<00:05:57.010> mute<00:05:57.220> the<00:05:57.370> track

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
point you might have to mute the track

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.460 
point you might have to mute the track
that<00:05:57.730> you're<00:05:57.820> recording<00:05:58.120> on<00:05:58.390> and<00:05:58.660> then<00:05:59.080> just

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 
that you're recording on and then just

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.580 
that you're recording on and then just
listen<00:05:59.980> to<00:06:00.250> the<00:06:00.340> backing<00:06:00.700> track<00:06:00.970> and<00:06:01.590> I've

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590 
listen to the backing track and I've

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.140 
listen to the backing track and I've
done<00:06:02.830> happy<00:06:03.040> to<00:06:03.160> do<00:06:03.280> that<00:06:03.430> a<00:06:03.460> couple<00:06:03.490> times<00:06:03.910> and

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150 
done happy to do that a couple times and

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.450 
done happy to do that a couple times and
it<00:06:04.240> sucks<00:06:04.540> but<00:06:04.780> what<00:06:05.470> what<00:06:05.770> can<00:06:05.890> you<00:06:05.950> do<00:06:06.100> what

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
it sucks but what what can you do what

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.870 
it sucks but what what can you do what
can<00:06:06.490> you<00:06:06.610> do<00:06:06.790> alright<00:06:07.570> so<00:06:07.860> if<00:06:08.860> you<00:06:09.400> aren't

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 
can you do alright so if you aren't

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.070 
can you do alright so if you aren't
using<00:06:10.330> a<00:06:10.780> ton<00:06:11.050> of<00:06:11.669> i/o<00:06:12.669> if<00:06:13.180> you're<00:06:13.510> not<00:06:13.690> using

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
using a ton of i/o if you're not using

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.920 
using a ton of i/o if you're not using
like<00:06:14.110> a<00:06:14.350> MIDI<00:06:14.800> keyboard<00:06:14.980> and<00:06:15.750> microphones<00:06:16.750> all

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
like a MIDI keyboard and microphones all

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.050 
like a MIDI keyboard and microphones all
the<00:06:16.990> time<00:06:17.200> whatever<00:06:17.410> it<00:06:17.680> is<00:06:17.830> you<00:06:18.610> can<00:06:18.760> increase

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.060 
the time whatever it is you can increase

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.510 
the time whatever it is you can increase
the<00:06:19.270> buffer<00:06:19.600> size<00:06:19.780> to<00:06:20.230> help<00:06:20.410> with<00:06:20.740> your<00:06:20.950> CPU

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 
the buffer size to help with your CPU

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.370 
the buffer size to help with your CPU
and<00:06:21.790> it<00:06:22.390> goes<00:06:22.540> up<00:06:22.690> to<00:06:22.840> 1000<00:06:24.210> so<00:06:25.210> choose<00:06:26.110> what

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:26.380 
and it goes up to 1000 so choose what

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.380 
and it goes up to 1000 so choose what
you<00:06:26.530> want<00:06:26.770> but<00:06:27.070> make<00:06:27.580> sure<00:06:27.610> that<00:06:27.910> if<00:06:28.090> you<00:06:28.210> are

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:28.390 
you want but make sure that if you are

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:31.740 
you want but make sure that if you are
going<00:06:28.570> to<00:06:28.690> record<00:06:29.310> MIDI<00:06:30.310> or<00:06:30.580> audio<00:06:31.000> that<00:06:31.450> you

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:31.750 
going to record MIDI or audio that you

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.330 
going to record MIDI or audio that you
need<00:06:31.990> to<00:06:32.169> mess<00:06:32.440> with<00:06:32.590> the<00:06:32.680> buffer<00:06:32.980> size<00:06:33.130> so

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.340 
need to mess with the buffer size so

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.940 
need to mess with the buffer size so
that<00:06:33.490> the<00:06:33.610> latency<00:06:34.030> is<00:06:34.060> little<00:06:34.990> to<00:06:35.140> none<00:06:35.380> all

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:35.950 
that the latency is little to none all

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:37.650 
that the latency is little to none all
right<00:06:36.190> so<00:06:36.520> those<00:06:36.789> are<00:06:37.000> the<00:06:37.090> three<00:06:37.330> things<00:06:37.479> I

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:37.660 
right so those are the three things I

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.989 
right so those are the three things I
want<00:06:37.840> to<00:06:37.900> talk<00:06:38.050> about

00:06:39.989 --> 00:06:39.999 
want to talk about

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:41.789 
want to talk about
