began<00:00:05.730> to<00:00:05.910> feel<00:00:06.120> frustrated<00:00:06.359> I<00:00:06.870> could<00:00:07.710> see<00:00:07.859> the

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
began to feel frustrated I could see the

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.459 
began to feel frustrated I could see the
opportunity<00:00:08.660> the<00:00:09.660> games<00:00:09.840> were<00:00:09.990> really<00:00:10.139> soft

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
opportunity the games were really soft

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.379 
opportunity the games were really soft
but<00:00:11.010> I<00:00:11.040> struggled<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:11.550> consistently<00:00:12.090> beat<00:00:12.269> the

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
but I struggled to consistently beat the

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:13.910 
but I struggled to consistently beat the
fish<00:00:12.599> that<00:00:12.809> were<00:00:12.870> filling<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.259> tables<00:00:13.590> and

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
fish that were filling the tables and

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.160 
fish that were filling the tables and
even<00:00:14.610> though<00:00:14.700> I<00:00:14.730> was<00:00:14.910> losing<00:00:15.210> money<00:00:15.360> I<00:00:15.599> felt

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
even though I was losing money I felt

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.470 
even though I was losing money I felt
terrible<00:00:16.619> because<00:00:17.100> I<00:00:17.699> didn't<00:00:18.240> know<00:00:18.300> whether

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
terrible because I didn't know whether

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.939 
terrible because I didn't know whether
or<00:00:18.660> not<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.930> decisions<00:00:19.350> I<00:00:19.439> was<00:00:19.529> making<00:00:19.590> were

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949

or not the decisions I was making were
correct<00:00:20.279> or<00:00:20.520> incorrect<00:00:20.880> I<00:00:21.500> wasn't<00:00:22.500> making<00:00:22.710> the

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
correct or incorrect I wasn't making the

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.189 
correct or incorrect I wasn't making the
right<00:00:22.890> adjustments<00:00:23.369> even<00:00:24.119> worse<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.630> didn't

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
right adjustments even worse I didn't

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.210 
right adjustments even worse I didn't
even<00:00:25.289> know<00:00:25.410> what<00:00:25.529> those<00:00:25.619> adjustments<00:00:26.099> were

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
even know what those adjustments were

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.730 
even know what those adjustments were
I'm<00:00:27.180> sure<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.510> know<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.720> feeling<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.619> have

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
I'm sure you know the feeling you have

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.560 
I'm sure you know the feeling you have
the<00:00:28.830> town<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.160> succeed<00:00:29.519> but<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.300> don't<00:00:30.510> have

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
the town to succeed but you don't have

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.200 
the town to succeed but you don't have
the<00:00:30.689> resources<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.170> do<00:00:31.349> so<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:32.030> finally<00:00:33.030> decided

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
the resources to do so I finally decided

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.729 
the resources to do so I finally decided
to<00:00:33.600> do<00:00:33.780> whatever<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:34.200> takes<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.500> get<00:00:34.590> this

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
to do whatever it takes to get this

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.290 
to do whatever it takes to get this
handled<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.309> take<00:00:35.760> my<00:00:35.910> game<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.239> next

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
handled and take my game to the next

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.900 
handled and take my game to the next
level<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.500> went<00:00:37.739> out<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.340> watched<00:00:38.520> every

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
level so I went out and I watched every

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.490 
level so I went out and I watched every
video<00:00:39.059> on<00:00:39.210> every<00:00:39.420> training<00:00:39.809> site<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.230> read

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
video on every training site and read

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.869 
video on every training site and read
every<00:00:40.800> book<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.160> could<00:00:41.309> get<00:00:41.399> my<00:00:41.520> hands<00:00:41.790> on

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
every book that I could get my hands on

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.639 
every book that I could get my hands on
but<00:00:42.629> none<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.930> worked<00:00:43.079> out<00:00:43.170> well<00:00:43.230> for<00:00:43.350> me

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
but none of it worked out well for me

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.380 
but none of it worked out well for me
the<00:00:44.250> content<00:00:44.670> was<00:00:44.760> fragmented<00:00:45.300> and

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
the content was fragmented and

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.270 
the content was fragmented and
incomplete<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:46.379> ultimately<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.920> just<00:00:46.980> turned

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
incomplete and ultimately it just turned

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.040 
incomplete and ultimately it just turned
me<00:00:47.340> into<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.520> big<00:00:47.730> NIT<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.480> just<00:00:48.660> didn't<00:00:48.840> feel

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
me into a big NIT it just didn't feel

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.279 
me into a big NIT it just didn't feel
right<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.910> wanted<00:00:50.910> more<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.600> decided<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.140> get
