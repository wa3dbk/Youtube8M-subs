exactly<00:02:13.390> one<00:02:13.750> hour<00:02:13.780> so<00:02:14.500> let's<00:02:14.650> see<00:02:14.829> how<00:02:14.890> they

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
exactly one hour so let's see how they

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.580 
exactly one hour so let's see how they
look<00:02:17.549> that's<00:02:18.549> pretty<00:02:18.790> good<00:02:19.000> I<00:02:19.379> think<00:02:20.379> that's

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
look that's pretty good I think that's

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.860 
look that's pretty good I think that's
probably<00:02:20.890> about<00:02:21.159> done<00:02:21.670> now<00:02:21.700> I<00:02:21.970> haven't<00:02:22.599> turned

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
probably about done now I haven't turned

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.750 
probably about done now I haven't turned
these<00:02:23.110> over<00:02:23.530> I<00:02:23.560> haven't<00:02:23.860> messed<00:02:24.069> with<00:02:24.189> them<00:02:24.430> at

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
these over I haven't messed with them at

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.280 
these over I haven't messed with them at
all<00:02:25.000> I<00:02:25.269> just<00:02:25.390> let<00:02:25.750> them<00:02:25.840> cook<00:02:26.049> just<00:02:26.260> like<00:02:26.470> that

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
all I just let them cook just like that

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.319 
all I just let them cook just like that
now<00:02:29.290> these<00:02:29.470> are<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.680> plain<00:02:30.010> ones<00:02:30.310> these<00:02:31.120> are

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
now these are the plain ones these are

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:34.619 
now these are the plain ones these are
the<00:02:31.920> baking<00:02:32.920> powder<00:02:33.189> coated<00:02:33.819> ones<00:02:34.030> they<00:02:34.480> look

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
the baking powder coated ones they look

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:37.500 
the baking powder coated ones they look
a<00:02:34.720> little<00:02:34.870> bit<00:02:35.109> different<00:02:35.620> so<00:02:36.120> I'm<00:02:37.120> gonna<00:02:37.209> pull

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
a little bit different so I'm gonna pull

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.390 
a little bit different so I'm gonna pull
those<00:02:37.689> out<00:02:37.959> I'm<00:02:38.560> gonna<00:02:38.650> put<00:02:38.920> them<00:02:39.010> on<00:02:39.129> some

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
those out I'm gonna put them on some

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.569 
those out I'm gonna put them on some
paper<00:02:39.609> towels<00:02:39.970> so<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.599> excess<00:02:41.260> fat<00:02:41.560> soaks<00:02:42.069> off

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
paper towels so the excess fat soaks off

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.270 
paper towels so the excess fat soaks off
of<00:02:42.849> them<00:02:43.030> and<00:02:43.239> then<00:02:43.769> I'm<00:02:44.769> gonna<00:02:44.889> put<00:02:45.099> them<00:02:45.220> in

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
of them and then I'm gonna put them in

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.550 
of them and then I'm gonna put them in
some<00:02:45.489> sauce<00:02:45.730> and<00:02:46.120> we'll<00:02:46.239> see<00:02:46.959> if<00:02:47.049> there's<00:02:47.319> any

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
some sauce and we'll see if there's any

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.629 
some sauce and we'll see if there's any
difference<00:02:47.769> in<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.280> taste<00:02:50.190> since<00:02:51.190> I<00:02:51.340> didn't

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:51.639 
difference in the taste since I didn't

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:56.149 
difference in the taste since I didn't
flip<00:02:51.909> these<00:02:52.150> over<00:02:53.549> they<00:02:54.549> are<00:02:54.700> a<00:02:54.730> little<00:02:55.030> bit

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159 
flip these over they are a little bit

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:00.089 
flip these over they are a little bit
soggy<00:02:57.159> on<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.579> bottom<00:02:58.290> you<00:02:59.290> can<00:02:59.319> see<00:02:59.500> they're

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
soggy on the bottom you can see they're

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.660 
soggy on the bottom you can see they're
not<00:03:00.189> crispy<00:03:00.670> on<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:00.819> bottom<00:03:01.170> but<00:03:02.310> that's<00:03:03.310> okay

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
not crispy on the bottom but that's okay

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.490 
not crispy on the bottom but that's okay
I<00:03:03.700> think<00:03:04.060> since<00:03:04.450> they're<00:03:04.599> sitting<00:03:05.049> right<00:03:05.079> down

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
I think since they're sitting right down

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.740 
I think since they're sitting right down
in<00:03:05.769> the<00:03:05.859> grease<00:03:06.129> I<00:03:06.579> think<00:03:07.060> if<00:03:07.150> I<00:03:07.239> flip<00:03:07.510> them

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
in the grease I think if I flip them

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.220 
in the grease I think if I flip them
then<00:03:07.959> the<00:03:08.859> top<00:03:09.099> side<00:03:09.430> would<00:03:09.670> just<00:03:09.879> get<00:03:11.970> soggy

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
then the top side would just get soggy

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.300 
then the top side would just get soggy
some<00:03:14.230> of<00:03:14.290> these<00:03:14.379> are<00:03:14.530> kind<00:03:14.769> of<00:03:14.829> sticking<00:03:15.129> a

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
some of these are kind of sticking a

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.300 
some of these are kind of sticking a
little<00:03:15.430> bit<00:03:15.699> but<00:03:16.290> that's<00:03:17.290> alright<00:03:17.680> maybe<00:03:18.190> I

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
little bit but that's alright maybe I

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.250 
little bit but that's alright maybe I
should<00:03:18.489> get<00:03:18.549> a<00:03:18.639> spatula<00:03:19.000> to<00:03:19.389> get<00:03:19.690> those<00:03:19.870> off<00:03:20.079> of

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
should get a spatula to get those off of

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.860 
should get a spatula to get those off of
there<00:03:20.410> with<00:03:20.879> okay<00:03:21.879> before<00:03:22.090> I<00:03:22.299> put<00:03:22.599> them<00:03:22.660> in<00:03:22.780> the

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
there with okay before I put them in the

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.830 
there with okay before I put them in the
sauce<00:03:23.139> those<00:03:24.099> are<00:03:24.459> the<00:03:24.579> baking<00:03:25.000> powder<00:03:25.209> coated

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
sauce those are the baking powder coated

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.770 
sauce those are the baking powder coated
ones<00:03:26.079> those<00:03:26.650> are<00:03:26.949> the<00:03:27.069> plain<00:03:27.340> ones<00:03:27.639> they<00:03:28.540> look

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
ones those are the plain ones they look

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.259 
ones those are the plain ones they look
just<00:03:28.959> a<00:03:29.139> little<00:03:29.290> bit<00:03:29.590> different<00:03:30.099> these<00:03:31.000> might

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
just a little bit different these might

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.479 
just a little bit different these might
be<00:03:31.449> just<00:03:31.690> a<00:03:31.810> little<00:03:31.959> bit<00:03:32.260> crispier<00:03:32.919> it's

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
be just a little bit crispier it's

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:34.949 
be just a little bit crispier it's
really<00:03:33.760> hard<00:03:33.940> to<00:03:34.030> tell<00:03:34.209> I'll<00:03:34.449> put<00:03:34.599> the<00:03:34.720> sauce

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
really hard to tell I'll put the sauce

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.259 
really hard to tell I'll put the sauce
on<00:03:35.230> them<00:03:35.379> and<00:03:35.500> taste<00:03:35.739> them<00:03:35.980> and<00:03:36.190> see<00:03:37.000> what<00:03:37.180> the

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
on them and taste them and see what the

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.530 
on them and taste them and see what the
difference<00:03:37.659> is<00:03:37.900> those<00:03:38.590> guys<00:03:38.829> that<00:03:39.099> were

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
difference is those guys that were

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.789 
difference is those guys that were
cooking<00:03:40.540> them<00:03:40.720> with<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:40.930> baking<00:03:41.260> powder<00:03:41.470> on

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
cooking them with the baking powder on

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.740 
cooking them with the baking powder on
them<00:03:41.919> too<00:03:42.099> they<00:03:42.280> were<00:03:42.340> using<00:03:42.579> fresh<00:03:43.150> wings<00:03:43.510> and

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
them too they were using fresh wings and

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.199 
them too they were using fresh wings and
these<00:03:43.840> are<00:03:43.959> frozen<00:03:44.199> wings<00:03:44.620> so<00:03:44.979> that<00:03:45.819> may<00:03:45.970> make

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
these are frozen wings so that may make

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.439 
these are frozen wings so that may make
a<00:03:46.239> difference<00:03:46.359> to<00:03:47.310> so<00:03:48.310> I<00:03:48.340> seasoned<00:03:49.090> the<00:03:49.120> wings

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:49.449 
a difference to so I seasoned the wings

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:53.640 
a difference to so I seasoned the wings
the<00:03:49.780> same<00:03:50.109> with<00:03:50.769> mr.<00:03:51.370> Yoshida's<00:03:52.650> original

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
the same with mr. Yoshida's original

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.649 
the same with mr. Yoshida's original
gourmet<00:03:54.129> sauce<00:03:54.519> it's<00:03:54.819> kind<00:03:55.000> of<00:03:55.030> a<00:03:55.120> teriyaki

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:55.659 
gourmet sauce it's kind of a teriyaki

gourmet sauce it's kind of a teriyaki
type<00:03:56.260> sauce<00:03:56.590> and<00:03:56.979> then<00:03:57.069> I<00:03:57.099> put<00:03:57.340> in<00:03:57.459> some

crushed red pepper flake for a little

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.860 
crushed red pepper flake for a little
heat<00:03:59.829> and<00:04:00.129> those<00:04:00.760> were<00:04:00.909> the<00:04:01.060> only<00:04:01.090> seasonings

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
I didn't season them with anything when

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.969 
I didn't season them with anything when
I<00:04:04.209> cook<00:04:04.540> them<00:04:04.720> and<00:04:04.930> they<00:04:05.169> turn<00:04:05.379> out<00:04:05.409> good<00:04:05.739> like

I<00:04:11.979> can't<00:04:12.250> tell<00:04:12.519> that<00:04:12.729> much<00:04:12.970> difference<00:04:13.479> in<00:04:13.659> the

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
I can't tell that much difference in the

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.920 
I can't tell that much difference in the
two<00:04:13.989> that<00:04:14.530> they're<00:04:14.889> real<00:04:15.639> similar

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
two that they're real similar

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.300 
two that they're real similar
so<00:04:18.410> really<00:04:19.310> the<00:04:20.299> big<00:04:20.509> thing<00:04:20.810> here<00:04:20.840> is<00:04:21.440> by

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
so really the big thing here is by

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.100 
so really the big thing here is by
cooking<00:04:22.580> the<00:04:22.850> frozen<00:04:23.330> wings<00:04:23.570> when<00:04:23.930> they're

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
cooking the frozen wings when they're

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.409 
cooking the frozen wings when they're
unthawed<00:04:24.650> like<00:04:24.979> that<00:04:25.250> you<00:04:25.550> save<00:04:25.790> about<00:04:25.940> a<00:04:26.090> half

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
unthawed like that you save about a half

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.560 
unthawed like that you save about a half
hour<00:04:26.630> of<00:04:26.840> cooking<00:04:27.139> time<00:04:27.620> but<00:04:28.300> they<00:04:29.300> really

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
hour of cooking time but they really

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.650 
hour of cooking time but they really
come<00:04:29.900> out<00:04:30.050> about<00:04:30.259> the<00:04:30.440> same<00:04:30.680> and<00:04:31.340> as<00:04:32.240> far<00:04:32.479> as

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
come out about the same and as far as

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.480 
come out about the same and as far as
putting<00:04:32.870> baking<00:04:33.470> powder<00:04:33.740> on<00:04:34.070> them

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
putting baking powder on them

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.550 
putting baking powder on them
I<00:04:34.600> couldn't<00:04:35.600> tell<00:04:35.750> a<00:04:35.810> lot<00:04:36.020> of<00:04:36.050> difference

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
I couldn't tell a lot of difference

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.740 
I couldn't tell a lot of difference
maybe<00:04:37.190> you<00:04:37.520> could<00:04:37.699> tell<00:04:37.940> more<00:04:38.180> difference<00:04:38.570> if

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
maybe you could tell more difference if

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.540 
maybe you could tell more difference if
you're<00:04:38.840> using<00:04:39.110> fresh<00:04:39.530> wings<00:04:39.860> I<00:04:40.160> don't<00:04:40.340> know

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
you're using fresh wings I don't know

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.520 
you're using fresh wings I don't know
but<00:04:41.650> so<00:04:42.650> that's<00:04:42.979> the<00:04:43.190> main<00:04:43.340> thing<00:04:43.389> if<00:04:44.389> you<00:04:44.600> have

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
but so that's the main thing if you have

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.409 
but so that's the main thing if you have
your<00:04:45.860> wings<00:04:46.070> on<00:04:46.280> thawed<00:04:46.520> they<00:04:46.910> cook<00:04:47.150> about<00:04:47.389> a

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
your wings on thawed they cook about a

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.219 
your wings on thawed they cook about a
half<00:04:47.630> hour<00:04:47.870> faster<00:04:48.590> but<00:04:49.240> they<00:04:50.240> turn<00:04:50.810> out<00:04:50.990> good

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:51.229 
half hour faster but they turn out good

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:53.879 
half hour faster but they turn out good
either<00:04:51.500> way<00:04:52.120> thanks<00:04:53.120> for<00:04:53.240> watching<00:04:53.630> you<00:04:53.690> guys

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
either way thanks for watching you guys
