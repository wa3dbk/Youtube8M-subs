00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.870
 November 2 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:10.710
 8:40 came on the field to farm 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.280
 before plowing in order to 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.460
 disinfect all plant residues 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.220
 soil 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.910
 that is, all the diseases of this season to 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:24.949
 did not go to the ground we slaughtered pepper tops 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:28.460
 now so that all these fusariums are gone 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:30.750
 all the more pepper ground and 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:35.610
 disinfect the soil from all sorts of diseases 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:39.180
 we treat trichodermin separately in 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:44.600
 5 liter egg-caps we broke it out 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:50.370
 paired this pasta made the hood out 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:53.190
 biohumus we add miles away in 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:59.309
 sugar waste sugar industry 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:01.760
 thick black liquid to 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.140
 the first time the bacteria was that 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:10.280
 consume so they multiply quickly 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:13.619
 soil that is, we do everything from the calculation if 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.170
 extract from vermicompost Megumi owls my star 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:21.140
 how would not call we do from 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:25.100
 calculating 50 liters per hectare trichodermin 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:30.060
 make one percent solution 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:34.470
 phytosporin according to the instructions obtained 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:40.610
 lemon balm I add 200 250 grams on 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:43.649
 the sprayer here we chopped pepper 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:49.049
 Now we are working on plant residues 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:50.549
 two hours later the tractor will come 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.399
 there is thus all this combination 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.290
 it will speed up the decomposition of organic 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:59.640
 in the soil and disinfect 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:02.630
 earth from all soil-dwelling diseases 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.439
 where are the diseases that overwinter 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.439
 land on plant debris 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.259
 bye everyone
