00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.960
 yoth hi every day is xenon 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.789
 and today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.890
 new gameplay so a new more than 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.150
 100 he's on black ops 2 so 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.490
 unfortunately this time it wanted to 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.679
 again on red again at the 94 n 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.939
 cross fast charger but you 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:28.460
 do not worry I'll try to get you 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.019
 do on other maps so otherwise the 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.609
 strict scores varies a bit compared to 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.930
 the last time so I play the star 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:34.370
 fighting adaf and hunting group 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.390
 why these scores strict all 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.070
 just because I wanted to 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.199
 tempt the blur therefore leaves the most 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.219
 200 he feels dying is the lot of 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:41.420
 stars in the daf it's really the 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:43.309
 best combination for that being 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.199
 given that if you get well to 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.370
 lock up the enemies in the spawn his 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:48.050
 scores claim to be doing a lot 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.699
 enormously what they ultimately have 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.079
 when you come out of your adaf so 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:53.149
 after swinging the other star 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.070
 hunting group et cetera you'll have 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.839
 more than redo two or three 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.129
 is it big maximum and you're unlocked 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:00.469
 another star and you can revive the 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.640
 machine like this indefinitely until the 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.469
 end of the game so unfortunately 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.820
 I did not manage to make the unclear 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:06.590
 I am still dead three times 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.960
 once when I died really very 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.850
 stupidly in the end anyway we get on 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.579
 fuck, huh, it's three dead, that's when 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.509
 even well above zero so in 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:16.430
 Anyway I hope you enjoy 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.030
 this gameplay even though it's true that the 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.369
 strict scores 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.540
 it's that there are not many 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.680
 kiel alarm i do not even know if i have 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.000
 does nuclear in this part 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.220
 treatment because that's how I do you 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.570
 say I wanted to try the flour and it's 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.590
 not with a lot of dog stars 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.000
 hunting group because there will be 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.100
 always a moment when you group of 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.990
 hunt will kill you at least once and at 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.610
 share rage and I do not see that much 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.469
 can bring you so otherwise 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.549
 today I will not talk about 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:38.689
 hours of gameplay because I had 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.979
 want to bring some small 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:41.600
 details at the level of more than 100 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.659
 kilos because I know there is not bad 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.340
 people who have doubted the veracity of 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.930
 gameplay who thought it was 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.700
 maybe some facts cocoon was inviting 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.340
 people to die in front there had been 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.140
 someone who told me so I quote 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.150
 approximately that the gameplay was 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.740
 beautiful 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.300
 but it did not matter how bad it is 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.530
 had one or two people in front who 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.240
 was a few actors so who were 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.230
 there to die that as long as there was 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.400
 the action was a bit like a movie 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.720
 but no no no no no I'm a 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.940
 I do not agree with that it's true that me 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.770
 boost limit when it's done well 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.360
 I would not mind watching but 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.580
 just by question of principle I 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.290
 hate it I do not want to see 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.600
 booster gameplay and I assure you that 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.390
 mine are not boosted so I 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.500
 do not know finally I can not explain myself 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.780
 anyway hours and hours 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.070
 on that there are tricks that do not cheat 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.140
 in quotation marks for all 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.150
 way will see boost everywhere when 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.950
 I told my friend that on my 240 to 2 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.470
 there was a guy in front who was 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.670
 0.72 good I can understand a lot 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.280
 that others have doubts 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.990
 honestly honestly I think that even 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.090
 me if I did not do that kind of thing 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.830
 I think I do I would say to myself that 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.690
 it's fake honestly 1,072 I 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.730
 found it slightly abused especially on 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.200
 a guy the bel20 i'll tell you this is 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.430
 like one of the funds cross guys with 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.620
 big prestige like that they 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.720
 finish part 1 66 while the 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.250
 guys have correct stats and what it 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.840
 I finally explain it to myself 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.880
 general I say to myself ok guys that's 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.010
 weird we have to accept that there is not 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.360
 the same mindset everywhere on the psn and 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.989
 who's still draw people is leaving 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.209
 not nowadays 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.610
 yes it's rare but stop telling you 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.900
 right now only if the guys melted 0.72 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.550
 from 1.66 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.320
 it is inevitably con booster that it is 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.890
 actors no we quickly have nobody 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.330
 to come fill the look and let yourself 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.500
 killing actually was told people to 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.880
 let himself be killed because yes we 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.590
 reinvite anyway that's it 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.420
 mandatory but re-invited to the 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.640
 recent players in a burst we do not look 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.170
 the stats we are not trying to invite 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.330
 people who are less strong than us for 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.560
 explode them anyway that we try 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.420
 already found the lobbies for quite 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.010
 a long time for that so once we 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.840
 reinvited have reacted everyone that this 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.980
 are guys at 3.2 ratio a ratio on 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.410
 just hope they go from yellow to 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.790
 his first aid tic and that's it 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.160
 for that there is also a lot less 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.660
 rage quit also because on the ps3 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.040
 legend it's less their stage because 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.870
 you can easily create an account 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.100
 it's the same if you play on xbox 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.959
 did not shout immediately at the boost 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.880
 because on xbox would rage quit to the 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.769
 lesser micro station are guys from the 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.400
 team so obviously the rage is also 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.440
 on xbox 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.670
 they try more than 100 on xbox and 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.260
 the least micro station there are 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.970
 capitulations issued good it's true that it 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.709
 on ps3 it almost never happens 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.630
 although I'll admit that when we 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.620
 play a game end a game 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.780
 over three years and earlier 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.400
 spread over 3 easy we eat each other 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.690
 tons of rage website and sahnouni that some 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.250
 gameplay while we were very 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.500
 well gone at the level of strict scores 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.549
 and that's the way I tell you 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.750
 I do not have a lot of time because this 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.830
 gameplay yeah he's not extremely 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.910
 long so that's how I say do not go 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.970
 not to believe that it's the mouth it was 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.590
 because a guy is 0.72 of 1.66 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.080
 even I'll tell you I'm the ones 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.580
 not honestly explain but I think 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.530
 that if I were a booster I would be more 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.660
 smart that this I do not feel to be 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.370
 someone stupid irl is really 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.800
 put a booster gameplay with people 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.150
 that make 1.71 of 0.72 in front of that 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.580
 would be called just stupidity because 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.620
 that it is burnt to 900 km that it is of 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.169
 boost finally in any case for those who 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.940
 might think that if i post it 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.380
 it's obviously because I know that 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.510
 it's not bus that nobody will arrive 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.729
 never to prove that there is anything 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.199
 is not normal in the gameplay is 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:00.760
 anyway since this 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:02.289
 gameplay there so for the 240 ha of and in 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.240
 particular to this one it's true that 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:05.889
 I had a lot of friends with me but 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.240
 for 240 to two it was only 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.400
 subscribers I did not know the day 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.350
 from before so obviously I could not 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.570
 boost her anyway I think 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.950
 it would already be honest if we had 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.000
 invited people to die I think 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.440
 that there would already be someone who has 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.120
 make a video on that on youtube with 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.720
 all the haters who hang out on this 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.570
 platform 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.070
 I think it would already be so here 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.820
 I will not justify myself for 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.070
 days and days 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.810
 I just hope you will understand that 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.030
 here are some people who are there just 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.229
 for fun or even under it 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.030
 who says to himself I'm going to do a game 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:35.200
 and no matter the score at the end me 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.490
 I was like that at the beginning I'll go 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.460
 to say when I started on the double 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:42.010
 xbox life and I clearly specify xbox I 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.240
 sometimes made me parties at 0.35 and 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.520
 it's not that I bought back 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.930
 so obviously guys like that there 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.830
 none in all parties must 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.539
 really have a phenomenal chance 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.280
 to come across a guy who will stay 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:53.800
 while he did not tilt and who 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.120
 was killed 70 times after also the 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.410
 case of guys like that they try to 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.180
 fart the scores triqueneaux stone on 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:00.010
 stumbled upon a guy like that precise 8 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.150
 with correct stats told us me 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:04.539
 I do not care about dying I think he has 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:06.789
 finished in 66 and the guy down they were riding 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:07.840
 just his comments his pitchers his 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:09.820
 rocket launcher there to fart the scores 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.010
 strict in gold so here I hope that 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.539
 you will understand all that it sucks me a 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.340
 little need to repeat myself about it 

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:16.449
 so I 'll do more latuquois videos 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.729
 I just want to take advantage of these two 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:19.690
 cents to explain a little 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:20.800
 why sometimes there were guys 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.210
 like that they have shady scores 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.229
 past 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.030
 it is clear that it is fishy in 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:25.590
 frankly I will not try to you 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.720
 say yeah now guys doing 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:30.180
 0.72 in all my parts is or is not 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.470
 no it's just lucky just fell 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.419
 on a rancid beginner will not leave 

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.740
 and so here on this I hope this 

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:38.720
 gameplay you will have pleased me I tell you to 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.720
