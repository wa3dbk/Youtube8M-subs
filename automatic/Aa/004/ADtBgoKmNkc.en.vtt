overall<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.690> think<00:00:15.929> we'll<00:00:16.109> look<00:00:16.199> for<00:00:16.440> he<00:00:16.560> was

overall I think we'll look for he was
around<00:00:16.740> 69<00:00:17.130> overall<00:00:17.580> so<00:00:17.730> this<00:00:17.820> is<00:00:17.970> definitely

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
around 69 overall so this is definitely

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.029

actually they picked Roman Hamrlik off
of<00:02:07.530> waivers<00:02:07.710> after<00:02:08.459> watching<00:02:08.640> from<00:02:09.030> there<00:02:09.239> I

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
of waivers after watching from there I

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.880 
of waivers after watching from there I
