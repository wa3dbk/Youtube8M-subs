now let's find out the camera

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.109 
now let's find out the camera
performance<00:00:17.890> of<00:00:18.039> this<00:00:18.160> device<00:00:18.220> and<00:00:18.789> here<00:00:18.970> we

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.119 
performance of this device and here we

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.330 
performance of this device and here we
have<00:00:19.270> the<00:00:19.420> camera<00:00:19.599> UI<00:00:19.990> as<00:00:20.230> you<00:00:20.470> can<00:00:20.650> see<00:00:20.860> we

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.340 
have the camera UI as you can see we

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.249 
have the camera UI as you can see we
have<00:00:21.550> a<00:00:21.580> subject<00:00:22.000> over<00:00:22.330> there<00:00:22.539> which<00:00:22.900> it<00:00:23.050> has

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:23.259 
have a subject over there which it has

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:25.109 
have a subject over there which it has
focused<00:00:23.710> so<00:00:23.860> it<00:00:23.950> does<00:00:24.130> have<00:00:24.340> autofocus<00:00:25.000> and

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:25.119 
focused so it does have autofocus and

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.150 
focused so it does have autofocus and
tap<00:00:25.330> the<00:00:25.480> focus<00:00:25.779> is<00:00:25.930> also<00:00:26.200> supported<00:00:26.680> and

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
tap the focus is also supported and

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.800 
tap the focus is also supported and

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.870 
the details in terms of the colors I was
expecting<00:01:06.909> so<00:01:07.420> the<00:01:07.840> camera<00:01:08.260> is<00:01:08.770> a<00:01:09.159> pretty<00:01:09.640> good

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
expecting so the camera is a pretty good

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.490 
expecting so the camera is a pretty good
camera<00:01:10.150> and<00:01:10.330> you<00:01:10.479> can<00:01:10.510> use<00:01:10.840> this<00:01:11.020> camera<00:01:11.380> the

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
camera and you can use this camera the

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.890 
camera and you can use this camera the
front<00:01:11.830> camera<00:01:12.100> say<00:01:12.490> you<00:01:12.909> can<00:01:13.060> just<00:01:13.240> rotate<00:01:13.570> the

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
front camera say you can just rotate the

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.660 
front camera say you can just rotate the
camera<00:01:14.229> module<00:01:14.380> and<00:01:14.710> it<00:01:15.070> will<00:01:15.250> show<00:01:15.460> you<00:01:15.520> the

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
camera module and it will show you the

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.420 
camera module and it will show you the
view<00:01:16.240> as<00:01:16.420> a<00:01:16.479> front<00:01:17.080> camera<00:01:17.290> view<00:01:17.680> so<00:01:18.130> you<00:01:18.189> can

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
view as a front camera view so you can

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.550 
view as a front camera view so you can
do<00:01:18.610> high-definition<00:01:19.479> video<00:01:19.600> calls<00:01:20.140> from<00:01:20.409> the

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
do high-definition video calls from the

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.990 
do high-definition video calls from the
front<00:01:20.770> camera<00:01:20.979> which<00:01:21.310> is<00:01:21.460> a<00:01:21.490> pretty<00:01:21.759> good

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
front camera which is a pretty good

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.480 
front camera which is a pretty good
thing<00:01:22.030> and<00:01:22.390> this<00:01:22.990> is<00:01:23.219> something<00:01:24.219> which<00:01:24.340> is

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
thing and this is something which is

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.099 
thing and this is something which is
possible<00:01:24.880> because<00:01:25.000> the<00:01:25.210> 13<00:01:25.600> megapixel<00:01:26.079> camera

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:26.109 
possible because the 13 megapixel camera

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:28.620 
possible because the 13 megapixel camera
at<00:01:26.530> the<00:01:26.649> back<00:01:26.679> can<00:01:27.520> be<00:01:27.700> rotated<00:01:27.969> and<00:01:28.240> can<00:01:28.479> be

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
at the back can be rotated and can be

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.569 
at the back can be rotated and can be
used<00:01:28.810> as<00:01:28.929> a<00:01:29.020> front<00:01:29.200> camera<00:01:29.439> which<00:01:29.859> is<00:01:30.070> one<00:01:30.549> of

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579 
used as a front camera which is one of

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
does it actually look like let me just

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.569 
does it actually look like let me just
take<00:01:55.270> a<00:01:55.299> photo<00:01:55.600> as<00:01:55.810> of<00:01:55.960> now<00:01:56.109> in<00:01:57.009> the<00:01:57.069> mirrored

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
so if you take the photo like this this

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.350 
so if you take the photo like this this
is<00:02:02.980> how<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.190> photo<00:02:03.490> will<00:02:03.730> look<00:02:03.880> like<00:02:04.060> however

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
is how the photo will look like however

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.720 
is how the photo will look like however
the<00:02:04.750> view<00:02:04.900> was<00:02:05.110> like<00:02:05.320> this<00:02:05.500> but<00:02:06.040> the<00:02:06.190> photo<00:02:06.430> is

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
the view was like this but the photo is

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.219 
the view was like this but the photo is
looking<00:02:07.180> like<00:02:07.360> this<00:02:07.510> this<00:02:07.690> is<00:02:07.840> how<00:02:07.930> you<00:02:07.990> can

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
looking like this this is how you can

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.050 
looking like this this is how you can
take<00:02:08.410> a<00:02:08.440> mirror<00:02:08.710> selfie<00:02:09.190> you<00:02:09.640> do<00:02:09.759> have<00:02:09.940> other

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
to use that you do have different kind

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.240 
to use that you do have different kind
of<00:02:16.570> more<00:02:16.810> supported<00:02:17.350> which<00:02:17.530> includes<00:02:17.920> night

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250

and<00:02:21.040> let<00:02:21.730> me<00:02:21.850> just<00:02:22.030> toggle<00:02:22.210> back<00:02:22.510> to<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.840> rear

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
and let me just toggle back to the rear

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.320 
and let me just toggle back to the rear
camera<00:02:23.290> so<00:02:23.650> that<00:02:23.800> I<00:02:23.830> can<00:02:24.130> show<00:02:24.820> you<00:02:24.880> and<00:02:25.150> for

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
camera so that I can show you and for

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.660 
camera so that I can show you and for
that<00:02:25.480> I<00:02:25.750> just<00:02:25.810> need<00:02:26.200> to<00:02:26.230> rotate<00:02:26.680> this<00:02:26.860> so<00:02:27.550> the

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
that I just need to rotate this so the

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.390 
that I just need to rotate this so the
moment<00:02:27.940> you<00:02:28.030> rotate<00:02:28.330> it<00:02:28.480> at<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.470> rear<00:02:29.620> and<00:02:29.890> you

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
moment you rotate it at the rear and you

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.250 
moment you rotate it at the rear and you
place<00:02:30.640> it<00:02:30.790> in<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:31.030> position<00:02:31.450> then<00:02:31.990> it<00:02:32.110> will

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
place it in the position then it will

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.140 
place it in the position then it will
start<00:02:32.500> acting<00:02:32.830> as<00:02:32.950> a<00:02:32.980> rear<00:02:33.160> camera<00:02:33.220> you<00:02:34.000> can

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
start acting as a rear camera you can

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.760 
start acting as a rear camera you can
always<00:02:34.300> take<00:02:34.600> photos<00:02:34.990> at<00:02:35.170> different<00:02:35.620> other

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
always take photos at different other

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.190 
always take photos at different other
resolution<00:02:36.520> the<00:02:37.330> resolution<00:02:37.360> which<00:02:37.900> is<00:02:38.050> set

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
resolution the resolution which is set

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.230 
resolution the resolution which is set
right<00:02:38.410> now<00:02:38.470> is<00:02:38.800> 20<00:02:39.100> megapixels<00:02:39.610> which<00:02:39.730> is<00:02:39.850> 4<00:02:40.090> is

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
right now is 20 megapixels which is 4 is

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.940 
right now is 20 megapixels which is 4 is
to<00:02:40.390> 3<00:02:40.600> but<00:02:41.080> if<00:02:41.200> you<00:02:41.290> would<00:02:41.470> like<00:02:41.500> to<00:02:41.709> take

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
to 3 but if you would like to take

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.280 
to 3 but if you would like to take
photos<00:02:42.370> fullscreen<00:02:42.910> on<00:02:43.120> this<00:02:43.300> device<00:02:43.570> which

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
photos fullscreen on this device which

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.500 
photos fullscreen on this device which
16<00:02:45.130> is<00:02:45.220> 2<00:02:45.340> 9<00:02:45.459> expect<00:02:45.850> ratio<00:02:46.090> you<00:02:46.209> can<00:02:46.360> always

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
16 is 2 9 expect ratio you can always

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.320 
16 is 2 9 expect ratio you can always
take<00:02:46.810> them<00:02:46.990> like<00:02:47.740> this<00:02:47.950> but<00:02:48.370> again<00:02:48.910> the

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
take them like this but again the

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.060 
take them like this but again the
resolution<00:02:49.840> will<00:02:50.020> be<00:02:50.050> 10<00:02:50.350> megapixels<00:02:50.860> in<00:02:50.920> that

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
resolution will be 10 megapixels in that

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.580 
resolution will be 10 megapixels in that
case<00:02:51.280> so<00:02:51.820> resolution<00:02:52.270> will<00:02:52.450> get<00:02:52.630> impacted<00:02:53.110> in

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
case so resolution will get impacted in

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.250 
case so resolution will get impacted in
case<00:02:54.040> you<00:02:54.220> do<00:02:54.400> a<00:02:54.580> do<00:02:55.120> capture<00:02:55.570> 10<00:02:55.780> megapixel

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
case you do a do capture 10 megapixel

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.410 
case you do a do capture 10 megapixel
photos<00:02:56.560> on<00:02:56.680> this<00:02:56.830> device<00:02:57.100> with<00:02:57.370> 16<00:02:57.730> is<00:02:57.820> to<00:02:57.940> 9/5

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
photos on this device with 16 is to 9/5

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.720 
photos on this device with 16 is to 9/5
ratio<00:02:58.780> so<00:02:59.290> all<00:02:59.620> these<00:02:59.950> things<00:03:00.130> actually<00:03:00.340> make

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
ratio so all these things actually make

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.780 
ratio so all these things actually make
this<00:03:00.850> device<00:03:01.150> pretty<00:03:01.450> good
