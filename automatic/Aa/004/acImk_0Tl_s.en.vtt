run-through<00:00:11.320> of<00:00:11.530> a<00:00:11.650> simple<00:00:11.889> mission<00:00:12.160> pointing

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:12.940 
run-through of a simple mission pointing

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.339 
run-through of a simple mission pointing
out<00:00:13.030> some<00:00:13.240> of<00:00:13.360> the<00:00:13.420> new<00:00:13.480> features<00:00:13.570> along<00:00:14.230> the

way so starting off on RS DV will hop

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.000 
way so starting off on RS DV will hop
into<00:00:19.480> the<00:00:19.509> commander<00:00:19.990> seat<00:00:20.170> and<00:00:20.500> take<00:00:20.710> a<00:00:20.770> peek

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.010 
into the commander seat and take a peek

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.970 
into the commander seat and take a peek
through<00:00:21.220> the<00:00:21.250> periscope<00:00:22.590> straight<00:00:23.590> away<00:00:23.710> we

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980 
through the periscope straight away we

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.080 
through the periscope straight away we
can<00:00:24.130> start<00:00:24.310> thinking<00:00:24.640> about<00:00:24.730> the<00:00:24.820> gameplay

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.090 
can start thinking about the gameplay

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.570 
can start thinking about the gameplay
potential<00:00:25.720> things<00:00:26.529> like<00:00:26.710> marking<00:00:27.160> targets

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 
potential things like marking targets

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.460 
potential things like marking targets
for<00:00:27.730> an<00:00:27.820> aerial<00:00:27.970> strike<00:00:28.300> inserting<00:00:29.199> units

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
for an aerial strike inserting units

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.970 
for an aerial strike inserting units
behind<00:00:29.560> enemy<00:00:29.800> lines<00:00:29.949> etc<00:00:30.369> I<00:00:31.860> think<00:00:32.860> it's

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
behind enemy lines etc I think it's

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.500 
behind enemy lines etc I think it's
useful<00:00:33.100> to<00:00:33.370> mention<00:00:33.730> because<00:00:34.120> it<00:00:34.330> helps

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
useful to mention because it helps

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.180 
useful to mention because it helps
reinforce<00:00:34.720> the<00:00:35.140> idea<00:00:35.170> that<00:00:35.530> all<00:00:35.769> over

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
reinforce the idea that all over

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.100 
reinforce the idea that all over
underwater<00:00:36.699> we're<00:00:37.120> still<00:00:37.390> part<00:00:37.600> of<00:00:37.750> the<00:00:37.809> same

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
underwater we're still part of the same

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
enormous world we can interact with it

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.289 
enormous world we can interact with it
impact<00:00:41.500> upon<00:00:41.739> be<00:00:42.339> part<00:00:42.580> of<00:00:42.670> a<00:00:42.790> larger<00:00:43.089> force

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:43.299 
impact upon be part of a larger force

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:45.600 
impact upon be part of a larger force
which<00:00:43.900> enables<00:00:44.500> us<00:00:44.559> to<00:00:44.620> do<00:00:44.830> a<00:00:44.860> wider<00:00:45.129> range<00:00:45.370> of

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
which enables us to do a wider range of

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:57.120 
which enables us to do a wider range of
more<00:00:45.850> interesting<00:00:46.420> things
