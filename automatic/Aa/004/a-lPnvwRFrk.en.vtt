love it why do we train we cut in theory
we<00:00:16.379> better<00:00:16.590> off<00:00:16.740> not<00:00:16.949> breaking<00:00:17.310> our<00:00:17.430> muscle

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
we better off not breaking our muscle

anyone who tried real light lifting

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.060 
anyone who tried real light lifting
would<00:00:23.910> cut<00:00:24.170> here's<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.320> deal<00:00:25.529> no<00:00:25.859> one's

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070

would cut here's the deal no one's
really<00:00:26.220> interested<00:00:26.670> in<00:00:26.789> this<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:27.060> think<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.330> very

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
really interested in this I think a very

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.990 
really interested in this I think a very
small<00:00:28.019> percent<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.439> population<00:00:28.619> no<00:00:29.580> offense

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
small percent of population no offense

Stephen<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.840> bottom<00:00:31.170> line<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.529> when<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.250> if

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
Stephen the bottom line is when you if

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.819 
Stephen the bottom line is when you if
you<00:00:33.210> don't<00:00:33.329> use<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:34.079> lose<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.380> if<00:00:34.649> your

you don't use it you lose it if your
minds<00:00:35.219> not<00:00:35.280> being<00:00:35.730> used<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.149> going<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.360> be<00:00:36.450> lose

the<00:00:37.260> only<00:00:37.440> thing<00:00:37.829> on<00:00:37.980> your<00:00:38.250> body<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.640> think<00:00:38.760> that

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
the only thing on your body I think that

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.080 
the only thing on your body I think that
has<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.629> one<00:00:40.430> physically<00:00:41.430> one<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.820> things

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.819 
has a one physically one of the things
for<00:00:42.570> example<00:00:42.660> your<00:00:43.140> penis<00:00:43.469> your<00:00:43.620> body

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
for example your penis your body

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.540 
for example your penis your body
self-regulates<00:00:44.579> in<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.760> morning<00:00:45.030> erection

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
self-regulates in the morning erection

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.770 
self-regulates in the morning erection
which<00:00:47.550> keeps<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.000> working<00:00:48.300> keeps<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.629> blood

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
which keeps it working keeps the blood

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.569 
which keeps it working keeps the blood
flow<00:00:49.020> keeps<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.410> healthy<00:00:49.500> now<00:00:50.219> if<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.430> don't

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
flow keeps it healthy now if you don't

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.369 
flow keeps it healthy now if you don't
stimulate<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.329> overload<00:00:51.780> your<00:00:51.930> muscles

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
stimulate and overload your muscles

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.860

what's<00:00:53.039> going<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.280> happen<00:00:53.640> they're<00:00:54.600> going<00:00:54.809> to

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
what's going to happen they're going to

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.740 
what's going to happen they're going to
atrophy<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.620> walking<00:00:56.430> even<00:00:56.879> jogging<00:00:57.629> is

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
atrophy and walking even jogging is

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.930 
atrophy and walking even jogging is
extremely<00:00:58.469> catabolic<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.250> when<00:00:59.730> in<00:00:59.910> the

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
extremely catabolic and when in the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.060 
extremely catabolic and when in the
absence<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.570> weight<00:01:00.809> training<00:01:01.140> converts<00:01:01.920> your

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
absence of weight training converts your

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.640 
absence of weight training converts your
type<00:01:02.280> 1<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.579> type<00:01:02.789> 2<00:01:02.940> muscle<00:01:03.270> fibers<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:04.199> for

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
type 1 and type 2 muscle fibers so for

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.080 
type 1 and type 2 muscle fibers so for
example<00:01:04.979> if<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.129> have<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.339> fast<00:01:05.610> twitch<00:01:05.939> it

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
example if you have the fast twitch it

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.030 
example if you have the fast twitch it
was<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.299> build<00:01:06.600> muscle<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.350> can<00:01:07.409> actually

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
was a build muscle it can actually

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.130 
was a build muscle it can actually
convert<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.580> into<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:09.150> slow<00:01:09.450> twitch<00:01:09.750> muscle

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
convert you into the slow twitch muscle

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.289 
convert you into the slow twitch muscle
fibers<00:01:10.439> now<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.159> cardio<00:01:11.610> can't<00:01:11.970> circumvent

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
fibers now it cardio can't circumvent

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.750 
fibers now it cardio can't circumvent
this<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.049> prevent<00:01:13.680> this<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.920> little<00:01:14.250> bit<00:01:14.369> but

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760
