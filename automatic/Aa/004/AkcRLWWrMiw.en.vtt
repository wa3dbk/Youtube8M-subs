 show us the club and the city our 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.180
 organizational capacity of such 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.530
 event and that it benefits all 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.820
 voices and to all people and 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.180
 club volunteers 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.210
 the meeting this year its 60 clubs 525 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.600
 major 2002 without commitment which 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:04.979
 represents 1200 race it's 72 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.799
 competition hours and among its 525 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.970
 swimmers two French champions 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:11.369
 counting nearly 70 medals 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.830
 international between them Yannick agnel 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.090
 and frÃ©dÃ©rick bousquet for the native of 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.070
 perpignan which was the first 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.450
 competition for over a year and his 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.340
 shoulder surgery 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.960
 the main thing was to find good 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.150
 sensations in a test certainly 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.780
 raised but without the stress of 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.780
 official competitions 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.729
 finally it's sweet it's a 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.650
 serene pleasant atmosphere 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.360
 there is a pro level side of 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.560
 the organization when we feel but we 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.159
 was here for my first 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.140
 competition 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.150
 I think there are only advantages 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.520
 allows me to get away from a little bit of 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.369
 my 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.719
 my clan finally it allows me to 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.060
 not put in front of adversity 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:50.320
 yes to see the national competition that 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.789
 allows me to relive in fact the 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.920
 competition in the best 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.899
 provisions ie in mode 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.340
 meeting ie we have a 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.569
 competition that is there for fun 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.479
 for the beauty of sport 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:03.880
 and without the stakes that can sometimes 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.319
 brought the negative aspects of a 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.670
 qualifying competition for a 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:08.470
 championship is forming at this 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.360
 organization and this atmosphere is appropriate 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.790
 also perfectly to yannick agnel 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.650
 for whom this kind of manifestation is 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.780
 the perfect place to meet the public 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.489
 in the stands but also around 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.010
 basins sometimes it can be so cool 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.269
 to do this kind of two meetings that 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.880
 to make championships of France or 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.170
 the world championship that allows to be 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.750
 find it close enough to the public 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.579
 to be close enough to young swimmers 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.440
 and it is to be able to share with them 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:34.360
 so it's different I'm in a 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.769
 a little difficult period where I am I 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.090
 am pretty tired right now 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.930
 heavy in the water we are in a job 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.290
 land that is quite important but 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.379
 explosiveness was there 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:50.239
 that was so cool there was no 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:51.799
 bad kids super super public if 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.329
 the clash between fred bousquet and 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.280
 yannick agnel held all his 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.170
 promises with including the victory of 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.939
 the latter on 50 m freestyle 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.220
 the double world champion and olympic 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:03.230
 however, nothing could be done 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.959
 vincent moscato during a challenge 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.640
 anthology initiated and won by 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.569
 the former rugby international and 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.730
 radio host 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.319
 the ex-hooker of the fifteen of France has 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.090
 thanked the French swimmer for 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:17.439
 have left him a little advanced and 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.439
 to have a real sense of humor 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.550
 to let win because never been able 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:29.230
 to be perfect for 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.000
 it's on this last good words of 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.440
 vincent moscato that concluded the 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.510
 third Olympic meeting of 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.410
 curve which still held this year 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.410
 all his promises 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.440
 and
