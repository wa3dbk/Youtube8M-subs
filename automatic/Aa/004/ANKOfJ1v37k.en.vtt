00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.450 

alright<00:00:01.260> here<00:00:01.650> we<00:00:01.680> have<00:00:02.100> the<00:00:02.730> shoulder<00:00:04.460> so

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
alright here we have the shoulder so

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.130 
alright here we have the shoulder so
we're<00:00:05.580> gonna<00:00:05.670> look<00:00:05.910> at<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.480> shoulder

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
we're gonna look at the shoulder

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.040 
we're gonna look at the shoulder
including<00:00:07.649> our<00:00:07.770> deltoid<00:00:08.610> and<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.510> rotator

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
including our deltoid and the rotator

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.770 
including our deltoid and the rotator
cuff<00:00:10.349> muscles<00:00:10.889> so<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.700> deltoid<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:12.300> going<00:00:12.719> to

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
cuff muscles so the deltoid is going to

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.539 
cuff muscles so the deltoid is going to
be<00:00:12.900> that<00:00:13.110> big<00:00:13.410> muscle<00:00:13.830> that's<00:00:14.130> right<00:00:14.340> it's

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
be that big muscle that's right it's

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.820 
be that big muscle that's right it's
kind<00:00:14.700> of<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.849> top<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.389> your<00:00:15.509> shoulder<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.199> we

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
kind of the top of your shoulder and we

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.590 
kind of the top of your shoulder and we
do<00:00:16.980> have<00:00:17.190> origins<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:17.820> insertions<00:00:17.940> for

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
do have origins and insertions for

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.150 
do have origins and insertions for
almost<00:00:18.779> all<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.080> these<00:00:19.350> muscles<00:00:19.770> here<00:00:19.830> in<00:00:20.070> the

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
almost all of these muscles here in the

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.950 
almost all of these muscles here in the
shoulder<00:00:20.580> we<00:00:20.820> need<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.060> be<00:00:21.180> responsible<00:00:21.810> for

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
shoulder we need to be responsible for

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.279 
shoulder we need to be responsible for
okay<00:00:22.920> so<00:00:23.010> if<00:00:23.490> we<00:00:23.760> think<00:00:23.939> about<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.449> deltoid<00:00:25.019> it

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
okay so if we think about the deltoid it

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.700 
okay so if we think about the deltoid it
is<00:00:25.680> going<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:26.359> originate<00:00:27.359> up<00:00:27.660> at<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:27.960> top<00:00:28.230> so

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
is going to originate up at the top so

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.790 
is going to originate up at the top so
at<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.010> clavicle<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:30.410> then<00:00:31.410> it's<00:00:31.560> going<00:00:31.740> to

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
at the clavicle and then it's going to

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.229 
at the clavicle and then it's going to
wrap<00:00:32.189> around<00:00:32.719> to<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:34.790> scapula<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.090> it's

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
wrap around to the scapula and it's

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.389 
wrap around to the scapula and it's
going<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.390> hit<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.809> acromion<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.829> scapula

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
going to hit the acromion of the scapula

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.470 
going to hit the acromion of the scapula
and<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:39.059> spine<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.500> scapula<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.370> then<00:00:42.180> it

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
and the spine of the scapula and then it

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.950 
and the spine of the scapula and then it
will<00:00:42.840> be<00:00:43.190> inserting<00:00:44.190> on<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:45.120> humerus<00:00:45.420> all

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
will be inserting on the humerus all

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.690 
will be inserting on the humerus all
right<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.410> inserts<00:00:46.800> at<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.070> deltoid

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
right so it inserts at the deltoid

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.209 
right so it inserts at the deltoid
tuberosity<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.020> humerus<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.739> bump<00:00:50.010> we

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
tuberosity of the humerus that bump we

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.830 
tuberosity of the humerus that bump we
found<00:00:50.520> when<00:00:51.090> we<00:00:51.120> were<00:00:51.239> looking<00:00:51.570> at<00:00:51.719> the

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
found when we were looking at the

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.500 
found when we were looking at the
humerus<00:00:52.350> now<00:00:53.100> if<00:00:53.370> you're<00:00:53.730> going<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.329> think

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
humerus now if you're going to think

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.510 
humerus now if you're going to think
about<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.780> action<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.440> deltoid<00:00:55.739> move

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
about the action of the deltoid move

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.260 
about the action of the deltoid move
your<00:00:56.730> shoulder

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
your shoulder

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.630 
your shoulder
I<00:00:57.300> mean<00:00:57.899> seriously<00:00:58.260> move<00:00:58.980> your<00:00:59.309> shoulder

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
I mean seriously move your shoulder

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.060 
I mean seriously move your shoulder
every<00:01:00.480> single<00:01:01.050> movement<00:01:01.289> pretty<00:01:01.770> much<00:01:01.890> of

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
every single movement pretty much of

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.520 
every single movement pretty much of
your<00:01:02.280> shoulder<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:03.030> going<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.449> have<00:01:03.960> part<00:01:04.350> I

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
your shoulder is going to have part I

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.960 
your shoulder is going to have part I
know<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.920> deltoid<00:01:05.280> will<00:01:05.430> have<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.580> part<00:01:05.880> in

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
know the deltoid will have a part in

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.620 
know the deltoid will have a part in
including<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:07.430> lateral<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.580> medial

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
including the lateral and medial

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.080 
including the lateral and medial
rotations<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:10.350> extension<00:01:11.250> flexion<00:01:11.549> and

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
rotations the extension flexion and

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.410 
rotations the extension flexion and
abduction<00:01:12.740> so<00:01:13.740> everything<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.790> deltoid<00:01:15.180> will

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
abduction so everything the deltoid will

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.480 
abduction so everything the deltoid will
be<00:01:15.600> working<00:01:15.930> on<00:01:16.049> moving<00:01:16.290> here<00:01:16.650> now<00:01:17.310> we're

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
be working on moving here now we're

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.969 
be working on moving here now we're
going<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.700> next<00:01:17.939> look<00:01:18.330> at<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:19.049> rotator<00:01:19.890> cuff

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
going to next look at the rotator cuff

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.340 
going to next look at the rotator cuff
there<00:01:20.820> are<00:01:20.939> four<00:01:21.299> major<00:01:21.509> muscles<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.200> the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
there are four major muscles of the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.350 
there are four major muscles of the
rotator<00:01:22.380> cuff<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:23.280> if<00:01:23.340> we<00:01:23.460> take<00:01:23.729> off<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.180> poor

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
rotator cuff so if we take off the poor

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.469 
rotator cuff so if we take off the poor
dudes<00:01:24.540> deltoid<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.470> know<00:01:26.100> we<00:01:26.850> are<00:01:27.000> going<00:01:27.270> to

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
dudes deltoid you know we are going to

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.719 
dudes deltoid you know we are going to
kind<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.930> turn<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.590> look<00:01:28.829> at<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.040> posterior

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
kind of turn and look at the posterior

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.109 
kind of turn and look at the posterior
side<00:01:30.210> here<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:31.320> arm<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.100> we're<00:01:32.939> going<00:01:33.090> to

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
side here of the arm and we're going to

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.190 
side here of the arm and we're going to
look<00:01:33.360> at<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.720> compared<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.259> our<00:01:34.939> scapula<00:01:36.200> our

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
look at it compared to our scapula our

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.410 
look at it compared to our scapula our
shoulder<00:01:37.619> joint<00:01:37.950> now<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.850> our<00:01:39.090> ball<00:01:39.390> and

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
shoulder joint now this is our ball and

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.289 
shoulder joint now this is our ball and
socket<00:01:39.930> joint<00:01:39.960> which<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.740> synovial<00:01:41.700> no<00:01:41.939> real

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
socket joint which is a synovial no real

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.780 
socket joint which is a synovial no real
joint<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.590> synovial<00:01:44.159> joint<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.579> going<00:01:44.729> to

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
joint so the synovial joint is going to

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.340 
joint so the synovial joint is going to
have<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> lot<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.299> things<00:01:45.570> going<00:01:45.899> on<00:01:45.990> in<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.229> this

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
have a lot of things going on in it this

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.590 
have a lot of things going on in it this
is<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.530> create<00:01:46.770> kind<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.130> crazy<00:01:47.520> joint<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:48.479> we're

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
is a create kind of crazy joint so we're

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.020 
is a create kind of crazy joint so we're
going<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.750> start<00:01:49.079> by<00:01:49.290> finding<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.950> spine<00:01:50.610> of

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
going to start by finding the spine of

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.510 
going to start by finding the spine of
the<00:01:51.360> scapula<00:01:51.869> so<00:01:52.320> there's<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.740> spine<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.369> the

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
the scapula so there's the spine of the

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.520 
the scapula so there's the spine of the
scapula<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.299> remember<00:01:55.140> when<00:01:55.259> we're<00:01:55.439> looking

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
scapula and remember when we're looking

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.530 
scapula and remember when we're looking
at<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.920> bones<00:01:56.100> we<00:01:56.310> talked<00:01:56.520> about<00:01:56.670> above<00:01:57.240> and

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
at the bones we talked about above and

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.590 
at the bones we talked about above and
below<00:01:57.899> so<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:59.299> infraspinatus<00:02:00.350> below<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.950> our

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
below so the infraspinatus below and our

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.120 
below so the infraspinatus below and our
supraspinatus<00:02:03.600> above<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.560> now<00:02:04.920> those<00:02:05.100> two

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
supraspinatus above it now those two

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.340 
supraspinatus above it now those two
Fosse's<00:02:05.939> are<00:02:06.210> going<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.540> be<00:02:06.689> where<00:02:06.990> the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
Fosse's are going to be where the

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.979 
Fosse's are going to be where the
muscles<00:02:07.860> are<00:02:08.190> going<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.610> attach<00:02:08.940> so<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.750> first

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
muscles are going to attach so the first

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.410 
muscles are going to attach so the first
one's<00:02:10.200> going<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.349> be<00:02:10.500> our<00:02:10.530> in<00:02:10.800> frost<00:02:11.340> Benet

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
one's going to be our in frost Benet

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.200 
one's going to be our in frost Benet
we're<00:02:12.810> going<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:12.990> find<00:02:13.140> below<00:02:13.460> the<00:02:14.460> spine<00:02:14.850> of

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
we're going to find below the spine of

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.180 
we're going to find below the spine of
the<00:02:15.240> scapula<00:02:15.810> this<00:02:16.290> is<00:02:16.380> a<00:02:16.440> pretty<00:02:16.620> big<00:02:16.830> muscle

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
the scapula this is a pretty big muscle

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.000 
the scapula this is a pretty big muscle
it<00:02:17.370> covers<00:02:17.730> most<00:02:18.120> of<00:02:18.540> that<00:02:19.110> surface<00:02:19.500> of<00:02:19.920> our

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
it covers most of that surface of our

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.400 
it covers most of that surface of our
scapula<00:02:20.670> so<00:02:21.120> it's<00:02:21.300> going<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.480> originate<00:02:22.200> on

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
scapula so it's going to originate on

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.300 
scapula so it's going to originate on
that<00:02:22.770> fossa

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
that fossa

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.490 
that fossa
so<00:02:23.430> on<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.880> infraspinous<00:02:24.630> fossa<00:02:25.050> of<00:02:25.410> the

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
so on the infraspinous fossa of the

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.890 
so on the infraspinous fossa of the
scapula<00:02:26.340> so<00:02:27.030> where<00:02:27.120> our<00:02:27.240> infraspinatus

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
scapula so where our infraspinatus

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.800 
scapula so where our infraspinatus
muscle<00:02:28.140> will<00:02:29.100> be<00:02:29.340> originating<00:02:30.150> nothing<00:02:30.660> like

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
muscle will be originating nothing like

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.000 
muscle will be originating nothing like
a<00:02:30.840> mouthful<00:02:31.500> there<00:02:32.060> it's<00:02:33.060> going<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.560> insert<00:02:34.560> on

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
a mouthful there it's going to insert on

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.010 
a mouthful there it's going to insert on
the<00:02:35.700> humerus<00:02:36.000> so<00:02:36.420> it's<00:02:36.570> actually<00:02:36.720> going<00:02:36.959> to

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
the humerus so it's actually going to

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.930 
the humerus so it's actually going to
have<00:02:37.200> an<00:02:37.290> insertion<00:02:37.709> number<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.280> moveable

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
have an insertion number the moveable

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.510 
have an insertion number the moveable
points<00:02:39.360> on<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.900> greater<00:02:40.290> tubercle<00:02:41.010> of<00:02:41.430> the

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
points on the greater tubercle of the

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.000 
points on the greater tubercle of the
humerus<00:02:41.910> so<00:02:42.510> that<00:02:42.720> point<00:02:43.140> there<00:02:43.560> on<00:02:43.800> the

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
humerus so that point there on the

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.970 
humerus so that point there on the
shoulder<00:02:44.340> that<00:02:45.209> is<00:02:45.600> also<00:02:46.260> going<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.620> be<00:02:46.830> the

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
shoulder that is also going to be the

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.120 
shoulder that is also going to be the
spot<00:02:47.280> where<00:02:47.760> two<00:02:48.600> other<00:02:48.810> muscles<00:02:49.290> originate

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
spot where two other muscles originate

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.670 
spot where two other muscles originate
so<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:50.970> action<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:51.600> our<00:02:51.720> infraspinatus<00:02:52.380> is

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
so the action of our infraspinatus is

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.070 
so the action of our infraspinatus is
going<00:02:52.830> to<00:02:52.890> be<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.130> lateral<00:02:53.760> rotation<00:02:54.390> so<00:02:54.930> if

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
going to be the lateral rotation so if

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.540 
going to be the lateral rotation so if
we<00:02:55.230> want<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.440> laterally<00:02:55.920> rotate<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.400> arm

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
we want to laterally rotate the arm

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.340 
we want to laterally rotate the arm
that's<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.270> muscle<00:02:57.420> that'll<00:02:57.810> be<00:02:57.900> helping<00:02:58.260> us

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
that's the muscle that'll be helping us

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.990 
that's the muscle that'll be helping us
out<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.900> next<00:03:01.170> will<00:03:01.410> be<00:03:01.440> our<00:03:02.000> supraspinatus

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
out the next will be our supraspinatus

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.570 
out the next will be our supraspinatus
so<00:03:03.870> this<00:03:04.050> muscle<00:03:04.410> is<00:03:04.470> going<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.650> be<00:03:04.739> above<00:03:05.250> the

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
so this muscle is going to be above the

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.479 
so this muscle is going to be above the
spine<00:03:05.910> it<00:03:06.209> is<00:03:06.660> going<00:03:06.930> to<00:03:07.200> be<00:03:07.350> originating<00:03:08.340> in

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
spine it is going to be originating in

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.500 
spine it is going to be originating in
the<00:03:09.020> supraspinous<00:03:10.020> fossa<00:03:10.709> on<00:03:11.340> our<00:03:11.850> scapula

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
the supraspinous fossa on our scapula

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.070 
the supraspinous fossa on our scapula
now<00:03:13.140> this<00:03:13.380> one<00:03:13.590> will<00:03:13.770> also<00:03:13.800> be<00:03:14.900> inserting<00:03:15.900> on

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
now this one will also be inserting on

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.860 
now this one will also be inserting on
the<00:03:16.350> greater<00:03:16.680> tubercle<00:03:17.250> of<00:03:17.549> the<00:03:17.610> humerus<00:03:17.870> with

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
the greater tubercle of the humerus with

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.580 
the greater tubercle of the humerus with
the<00:03:19.110> infraspinatus<00:03:20.690> now<00:03:21.690> this<00:03:22.019> one<00:03:22.260> will<00:03:22.440> help

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
the infraspinatus now this one will help

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.979 
the infraspinatus now this one will help
us<00:03:22.830> to<00:03:23.130> abduct<00:03:23.820> the<00:03:24.269> arm<00:03:24.299> so<00:03:24.840> the

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
us to abduct the arm so the

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.740 
us to abduct the arm so the
supraspinatus<00:03:25.950> muscle<00:03:26.130> will<00:03:26.790> help<00:03:27.030> abduct

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
supraspinatus muscle will help abduct

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.070 
supraspinatus muscle will help abduct
the<00:03:28.230> arm

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.390 

our<00:03:32.080> next<00:03:32.350> muscle<00:03:32.560> here<00:03:32.830> we<00:03:32.890> can<00:03:33.040> see<00:03:33.190> on<00:03:33.280> the

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
our next muscle here we can see on the

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.240 
our next muscle here we can see on the
back<00:03:33.550> side<00:03:33.730> is<00:03:33.880> the<00:03:34.030> Terry's<00:03:34.690> minor<00:03:35.170> and<00:03:35.560> then

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
back side is the Terry's minor and then

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.010 
back side is the Terry's minor and then
the<00:03:36.370> Terry's<00:03:36.790> major<00:03:37.150> is<00:03:37.450> actually<00:03:37.810> right

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
the Terry's major is actually right

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.800 
the Terry's major is actually right
below<00:03:38.410> at<00:03:38.560> that<00:03:38.740> big<00:03:38.920> fat<00:03:38.950> muscle<00:03:39.850> the<00:03:40.300> Terry's

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
below at that big fat muscle the Terry's

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.110 
below at that big fat muscle the Terry's
major<00:03:41.200> is<00:03:41.560> not<00:03:41.770> part<00:03:42.070> of<00:03:42.130> the<00:03:42.220> rotator<00:03:42.580> cuff<00:03:42.700> so

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
major is not part of the rotator cuff so

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.250 
major is not part of the rotator cuff so
you<00:03:43.150> don't<00:03:43.390> have<00:03:43.570> to<00:03:43.630> know<00:03:43.750> origin<00:03:44.110> and

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
you don't have to know origin and

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.080 
you don't have to know origin and
insertion<00:03:44.380> but<00:03:44.980> you<00:03:45.070> do<00:03:45.310> for<00:03:45.580> the<00:03:45.670> Terry's

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
insertion but you do for the Terry's

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.740 
insertion but you do for the Terry's
minor

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
minor

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.930 
minor
now<00:03:47.170> the<00:03:47.230> Terry's<00:03:47.740> minor<00:03:48.070> is<00:03:48.370> going<00:03:48.790> to

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
now the Terry's minor is going to

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.270 
now the Terry's minor is going to
originate<00:03:49.570> at<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:49.960> lateral<00:03:50.560> border<00:03:50.590> of<00:03:51.160> the

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
originate at the lateral border of the

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.930 
originate at the lateral border of the
scapula

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
scapula

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.630 
scapula
so<00:03:52.090> almost<00:03:52.390> back<00:03:52.600> there<00:03:52.810> at<00:03:52.930> the<00:03:53.080> point<00:03:53.640> and

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
so almost back there at the point and

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.850 
so almost back there at the point and
then<00:03:55.060> it<00:03:55.210> will<00:03:55.330> also<00:03:55.780> be<00:03:55.900> inserting<00:03:56.530> at<00:03:56.710> the

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
then it will also be inserting at the

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.450 
then it will also be inserting at the
greater<00:03:57.190> tubercle<00:03:57.910> err<00:03:58.540> on<00:03:58.570> the<00:03:59.140> humerus<00:03:59.500> this

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.460 
greater tubercle err on the humerus this

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.420 
greater tubercle err on the humerus this
one<00:04:00.870> where<00:04:01.870> Terry's<00:04:02.500> and<00:04:02.650> minor<00:04:02.830> will<00:04:03.130> help<00:04:03.280> us

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
one where Terry's and minor will help us

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.030 
one where Terry's and minor will help us
to<00:04:03.610> laterally<00:04:04.360> rotate<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:05.440> arms<00:04:05.770> I<00:04:05.890> think

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
to laterally rotate the arms I think

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.350 
to laterally rotate the arms I think
about<00:04:06.190> all<00:04:06.310> the<00:04:06.460> movement<00:04:06.880> your<00:04:07.000> shoulder

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
about all the movement your shoulder

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.480 
about all the movement your shoulder
does<00:04:07.570> all<00:04:07.870> four<00:04:08.590> of<00:04:08.620> these<00:04:08.890> muscles<00:04:09.280> are<00:04:09.400> going

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:09.490 
does all four of these muscles are going

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.090 
does all four of these muscles are going
to<00:04:09.580> combine<00:04:09.820> with<00:04:10.210> that<00:04:10.450> now<00:04:11.350> as<00:04:11.500> we<00:04:11.650> turn

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
to combine with that now as we turn

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.710 
to combine with that now as we turn
we're<00:04:12.880> going<00:04:13.060> to<00:04:13.120> look<00:04:13.330> at<00:04:13.600> the<00:04:14.790> front<00:04:15.790> side<00:04:16.360> of

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
we're going to look at the front side of

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:23.520 
we're going to look at the front side of
the<00:04:17.470> arm<00:04:21.240> we<00:04:22.240> can<00:04:22.570> see<00:04:22.840> that<00:04:23.020> we<00:04:23.170> are<00:04:23.290> looking

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
the arm we can see that we are looking

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.460 
the arm we can see that we are looking
at<00:04:24.040> the<00:04:25.050> sub<00:04:26.220> scapular<00:04:27.220> fossa<00:04:27.850> and

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
at the sub scapular fossa and

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.990 
at the sub scapular fossa and
subscapularis<00:04:29.470> is<00:04:30.310> going<00:04:30.490> to<00:04:30.550> be<00:04:30.640> the<00:04:30.760> name<00:04:30.970> of

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
subscapularis is going to be the name of

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.420 
subscapularis is going to be the name of
the<00:04:31.270> muscle<00:04:31.660> that<00:04:31.690> comes<00:04:32.050> through<00:04:32.380> here<00:04:32.800> so

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
the muscle that comes through here so

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.150 
the muscle that comes through here so
the<00:04:33.720> subscapularis<00:04:34.720> is<00:04:35.140> the<00:04:35.320> only<00:04:35.710> muscle<00:04:35.920> on

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
the subscapularis is the only muscle on

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.470 
the subscapularis is the only muscle on
the<00:04:36.250> front<00:04:36.550> part<00:04:36.760> of<00:04:36.790> the<00:04:36.910> scapula<00:04:37.390> as

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
the front part of the scapula as

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.940 
the front part of the scapula as
basically<00:04:37.780> covers<00:04:38.170> the<00:04:38.350> whole<00:04:38.530> thing<00:04:38.770> and

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
basically covers the whole thing and

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.750 
basically covers the whole thing and
will<00:04:39.190> originate<00:04:39.610> along<00:04:40.450> that<00:04:40.960> fossa<00:04:41.460> now<00:04:42.460> this

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
will originate along that fossa now this

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.030 
will originate along that fossa now this
will<00:04:42.970> be<00:04:43.090> the<00:04:43.210> only<00:04:43.450> muscle<00:04:43.960> that<00:04:44.290> inserts<00:04:44.800> on

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
will be the only muscle that inserts on

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.330 
will be the only muscle that inserts on
the<00:04:45.310> lesser<00:04:45.970> tubercle<00:04:46.660> of<00:04:47.020> the<00:04:47.110> humerus<00:04:47.740> so

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
the lesser tubercle of the humerus so

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.280 
the lesser tubercle of the humerus so
all<00:04:48.550> the<00:04:48.850> other<00:04:48.880> three<00:04:49.390> of<00:04:49.540> our<00:04:49.660> rotator<00:04:50.050> cuff

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
all the other three of our rotator cuff

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.140 
all the other three of our rotator cuff
are<00:04:50.440> all<00:04:50.530> on<00:04:50.620> the<00:04:50.740> greater<00:04:51.070> tubercle<00:04:51.490> this<00:04:51.970> one

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
are all on the greater tubercle this one

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.360 
are all on the greater tubercle this one
is<00:04:52.300> on<00:04:52.419> the<00:04:52.450> lesser<00:04:52.990> tubercle<00:04:53.320> and<00:04:53.650> it's<00:04:54.160> going

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
is on the lesser tubercle and it's going

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.150 
is on the lesser tubercle and it's going
to<00:04:54.460> help<00:04:54.580> us<00:04:54.760> medially<00:04:55.690> rotate<00:04:56.440> the<00:04:56.950> humerus

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
to help us medially rotate the humerus

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.550 
to help us medially rotate the humerus
so<00:04:58.030> we<00:04:58.180> think<00:04:58.270> about<00:04:58.390> rotations<00:04:59.290> and

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
so we think about rotations and

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.740 
so we think about rotations and
abducting<00:05:00.280> all<00:05:00.580> of<00:05:00.880> these<00:05:01.030> rotator<00:05:01.450> cuff

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
abducting all of these rotator cuff

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.300 
abducting all of these rotator cuff
muscles<00:05:02.320> are<00:05:02.470> going<00:05:02.650> to<00:05:02.740> be<00:05:02.830> the<00:05:02.950> ones<00:05:03.130> that

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
muscles are going to be the ones that

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.000 
muscles are going to be the ones that
are<00:05:03.430> doing<00:05:03.610> it<00:05:03.910> so<00:05:04.720> I<00:05:04.750> think<00:05:04.990> that<00:05:05.470> that's<00:05:05.800> it

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
are doing it so I think that that's it

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.040 
are doing it so I think that that's it
for<00:05:06.340> our<00:05:06.370> shoulder<00:05:06.850> sounds<00:05:07.510> we<00:05:07.600> good

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
for our shoulder sounds we good

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.560 
for our shoulder sounds we good
all<00:05:08.200> right
