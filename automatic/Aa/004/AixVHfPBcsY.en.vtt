better than onions and I said none of
these<00:01:15.570> have<00:01:15.780> gone<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.020> seed<00:01:16.259> this<00:01:16.409> year<00:01:16.650> so<00:01:17.000> you

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
these have gone to seed this year so you

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.760 
these have gone to seed this year so you
know<00:01:18.090> it's<00:01:18.240> been<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.420> hundred<00:01:18.780> percent<00:01:18.869> success

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
know it's been a hundred percent success

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.370 
know it's been a hundred percent success
rate<00:01:20.210> but<00:01:21.210> they're<00:01:21.420> probably<00:01:21.869> getting<00:01:22.080> done

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
rate but they're probably getting done

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.499 
rate but they're probably getting done
for<00:01:22.530> about<00:01:22.650> three<00:01:23.040> three<00:01:23.520> ounces<00:01:23.880> maybe<00:01:24.030> four

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
for about three three ounces maybe four

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.990 
for about three three ounces maybe four
ounces<00:01:24.900> silver<00:01:25.460> you<00:01:26.460> can<00:01:26.520> see<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.790> for<00:01:26.939> a

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
ounces silver you can see that for a

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.249 
ounces silver you can see that for a
shill<00:01:27.240> are<00:01:27.360> it's<00:01:27.450> nearly<00:01:27.630> as<00:01:27.720> big<00:01:27.869> as<00:01:27.990> what's

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259
