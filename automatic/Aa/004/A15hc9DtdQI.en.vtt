00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
the faster trucks up here just because

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.040 
the faster trucks up here just because
of<00:01:17.950> the<00:01:18.130> fact<00:01:18.310> that<00:01:18.460> there<00:01:18.729> are<00:01:18.850> two<00:01:19.479> turbos

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
of the fact that there are two turbos

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
helping to make up for the lag tell us

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.910 
helping to make up for the lag tell us
some<00:01:22.450> of<00:01:22.509> the<00:01:22.600> hotter<00:01:22.780> trucks<00:01:23.050> out<00:01:23.229> here<00:01:23.259> for

some of the hotter trucks out here for

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.020 
some of the hotter trucks out here for

nine<00:01:45.660> this<00:01:46.410> is<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.640> speedster<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.570> bunch

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
nine this is the speedster of the bunch

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.030 
nine this is the speedster of the bunch
yes

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.570 

all<00:02:29.260> right<00:02:29.380> we<00:02:29.500> have<00:02:29.530> a<00:02:29.650> result<00:02:30.010> check<00:02:30.370> it<00:02:30.489> out

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
all right we have a result check it out

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.020 
all right we have a result check it out
guys<00:02:30.989> 7.99<00:02:31.989> we<00:02:32.530> just<00:02:32.739> broke<00:02:32.980> eight<00:02:33.580> seconds

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
guys 7.99 we just broke eight seconds

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.850 
guys 7.99 we just broke eight seconds
barely<00:02:34.420> it's<00:02:34.720> a<00:02:34.840> fraction<00:02:35.260> faster<00:02:35.410> than<00:02:35.739> the

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
barely it's a fraction faster than the

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.550 
barely it's a fraction faster than the
RAM<00:02:36.099> but<00:02:36.819> nevertheless<00:02:37.209> this<00:02:37.870> is<00:02:37.930> a<00:02:38.200> dragster

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
RAM but nevertheless this is a dragster

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.750 
RAM but nevertheless this is a dragster
of<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:38.920> bunch<00:02:39.069> and<00:02:39.190> you<00:02:39.250> may<00:02:39.370> be<00:02:39.430> thinking<00:02:39.519> to

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
of the bunch and you may be thinking to

yourself well I don't live a mile above
sea<00:02:41.200> level<00:02:41.380> well<00:02:41.680> these<00:02:42.190> numbers<00:02:42.459> are<00:02:43.000> very

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
sea level well these numbers are very

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:44.880 
sea level well these numbers are very
interesting<00:02:44.049> because<00:02:44.140> this<00:02:44.410> is<00:02:44.470> where<00:02:44.739> the

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
interesting because this is where the
