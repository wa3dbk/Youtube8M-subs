 load that you want to use in your 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.850
 barbecue 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.420
 so put the first tip you go 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:07.710
 use the company four cloves of garlic 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.869
 I 'm already with everyone. 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.360
 the ingredients ready then it's just 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.260
 put in the crossing and put to 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.830
 to function 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:20.700
 so after you user you use 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:23.659
 chopped parsley and I used a 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.650
 parsley sauce a bundle of parsley 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.619
 put them together 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.950
 and here you will mixing comes picking up the 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:35.939
 detail in a very fast way 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.100
 after you put the parsley 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:42.060
 You already put it is a spicy sauce 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:45.240
 You'll put a spoon or sock 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.369
 spoon of pepperoni pepper 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.920
 if you do not have pepperoni you 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.710
 can use chilli peppers any kind of 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.200
 pepper that you have at home after 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.670
 if you see you use a generous spoonful 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.270
 of oregano 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.119
 A good tip here is if you have the 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.159
 fresh oregano tap is not everyone that 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.360
 can buy fresh oregano at 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.319
 any time 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.800
 then place the oregano even if it is 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.860
 dehydrated 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.970
 then you get with 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:22.040
 neither the chopped purple onion can 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:25.730
 very coarse method does not have to cut 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.490
 very thin and way and put it here 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.520
 another top of salt 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.100
 Salt is there to your liking. 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.520
 I'm going to use an amount that I think 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.190
 that will be good for this seasoning as 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.060
 I said he goes over the meat and 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:47.270
 then in the end all these ingredients 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.940
 we're going to 1st time what olive oil 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.970
 in glass of olive oil and we will use 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:58.420
 also red wine vinegar and here 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.420
 you put the same amount of olive oil 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:06.250
 you will put the same amount of 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.250
 Red wine 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.170
 Only I said it's red wine but the 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.280
 red wine taking tonight 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:18.070
