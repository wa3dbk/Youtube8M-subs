animal<00:02:46.950> than<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.670> chocolate<00:02:48.150> ones<00:02:48.359> so<00:02:48.799> they

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
animal than the chocolate ones so they

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:55.429 
animal than the chocolate ones so they
may<00:02:50.599> require<00:02:51.599> a<00:02:53.329> little<00:02:54.329> coaxing<00:02:54.900> let's<00:02:55.200> see

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:55.439 
may require a little coaxing let's see

00:02:55.439 --> 00:03:01.759 
may require a little coaxing let's see
here

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.699 

additional<00:03:02.700> church<00:03:02.969> yeah<00:03:03.750> I<00:03:04.109> just<00:03:04.260> have<00:03:04.590> this

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
additional church yeah I just have this

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.580 
additional church yeah I just have this
little<00:03:04.950> baby<00:03:05.159> whisker<00:03:05.819> that<00:03:06.090> might<00:03:07.019> encourage

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
little baby whisker that might encourage

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.970 
little baby whisker that might encourage
them<00:03:07.890> to<00:03:08.659> but<00:03:09.659> the<00:03:09.810> longer<00:03:10.200> it<00:03:10.290> sits<00:03:10.500> this<00:03:10.799> is

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
them to but the longer it sits this is

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.679 
them to but the longer it sits this is
going<00:03:11.159> to<00:03:11.219> take<00:03:11.400> a<00:03:11.430> while<00:03:11.730> to<00:03:11.760> cool<00:03:12.150> off<00:03:12.359> so

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:12.689 
going to take a while to cool off so

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:14.479 
going to take a while to cool off so
eventually<00:03:13.109> these<00:03:13.769> are<00:03:13.980> all<00:03:14.069> going<00:03:14.219> to<00:03:14.310> break

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
eventually these are all going to break

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.509 
eventually these are all going to break
down<00:03:15.079> and<00:03:16.079> you<00:03:16.290> just<00:03:16.500> need<00:03:16.709> to<00:03:16.890> keep<00:03:17.219> stirring

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
down and you just need to keep stirring

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:18.440 
down and you just need to keep stirring
it<00:03:17.819> that's<00:03:18.030> all
