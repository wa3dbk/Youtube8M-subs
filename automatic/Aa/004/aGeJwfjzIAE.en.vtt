00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
material and I think that this is also

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.170 
material and I think that this is also
going<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.100> be<00:02:17.160> really<00:02:17.459> cute<00:02:17.700> for<00:02:17.880> springtime

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
to wear with some jeans or just some

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.810 
to wear with some jeans or just some
minor<00:02:21.870> colored<00:02:22.320> jeans<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:23.010> I<00:02:23.190> just<00:02:23.580> cannot
