00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.540
 So it looks like the Samsung Galaxy 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.040
 s 5 finally a flagship of 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.840
 samsung that you already visually from 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.059
 can distinguish his predecessors 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.490
 was not always the case on the one hand 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.350
 Of course the color is available in blue gold 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.600
 white and black and then stop by 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.100
 this perforation here as well, though 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.449
 that looks like metallic 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.699
 of course plastic that you can tell 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.900
 at the latest when you open this here 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.460
 Unfortunately, I can not do it now 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.439
 completely demonstrate because of this 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.590
 safety device but it is enough 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.360
 stop to look at battery replaceable 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.649
 2800 milliamps wireless love 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.690
 By the way, that was the way it is now 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.750
 just put it on the charging station 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.940
 already is loaded there and of course stop 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.059
 again, the slot to expand the 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.210
 memory up to 64 gigabytes internal 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.930
 again 16 or 32 gigabytes so everything 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.969
 as usual 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.920
 but of course there are each 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.660
 First of all, there is a lot of new stuff when you are here 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.420
 It is really nice to do that everywhere 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.820
 the IP67 protection against dust and 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.230
 Water is a special active 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.809
 was not needed 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.720
 of course, as in advance 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.100
 put it here under this home button 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.570
 fingerprint reader, however, not only 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.549
 Just put it on but you have to 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.260
 just pull over it as usual and then 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.939
 Start various applications as you like 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.759
 You may want to unlock the device 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.100
 and paypal now from start so to speak 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.780
 I'm also there 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.880
 the possibility to pay for it 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.860
 of course a private fashion that 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.330
 means in the protected area where I only 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.560
 come in when I finger this 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.759
 unlocked everything that belonged to it 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.729
 51 cents if you ever on the 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:40.020
 front are 5.1 inches diagonal again 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:42.689
 full hd 1080 x 1920 pixel super amoled 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.579
 should candela up to 500 that keeps his 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.560
 that would be quite a amoled-display 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.540
 excellent and above all something 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.520
 I now also found it amazing 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.520
 is not only the latest snapdragon 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.189
 805 quad core processor in there with 2.5 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.920
 gigahertz two gigabytes of memory 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:01.079
 but also four can also be wireless 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.420
 lan ac mimo that means they have here 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.000
 more with a lan antenna installed and 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.729
 samsung claims it could now be said 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.619
 in fact, almost twice the data rate 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.620
 generate as usual 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.379
 34 and it's supposed to be on wireless lan and 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.580
 Let's combine in parallel that 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:21.510
 of course he's super hyper 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.140
 ultrafast usb 3.0 nfc everything there believe 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.030
 I'm not even closer 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.099
 go into everything that has belonged 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.329
 Of course, I totally wanted to do that 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.040
 only briefly on the back 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:30.659
 actually go here because have it 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.010
 not only with the camera with 16 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:35.370
 megapixel what but above all things 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.019
 the autofocus to be super fast 03 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.340
 Seconds fast means so 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.569
 usually everyone is always a picture 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.090
 shot with his smartphone 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.890
 knows that can take forever 23 seconds 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.109
 But he is also keen 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.750
 0.3 seconds if that's really true 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:52.709
 would be super so helpful 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.660
 also and above all things said hdr in 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.150
 Real time has you ever seen that 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.099
 the magazin demonstrated so far 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.799
 it was actually so that I am with 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:04.079
 he had it on a hdr photo 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.879
 turned on and then 345 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:08.099
 taken in succession with 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:10.260
 different exposure times and then 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.269
 afterwards complicated by software 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.560
 summed up that took time and 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.840
 You did not know what you were looking for 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.880
 getting involved hear what you see is what 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.680
 you get me so nicely that means that 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.950
 what I see here at this moment 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.000
 zack presses on the trigger that get 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.069
 Me too and above all , too 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.200
 correspondingly quickly zag already is the 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.310
 photo shot so not only practical 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.230
 and I want to be quick in front of everybody 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.000
 also knows exactly how the result 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.280
 looks and whether that brings something or 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.139
 not and says hdr if necessary again 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.190
 turn off well here at this 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:39.750
 lighting conditions can be seen now 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.489
 come difference is completely clear though 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.739
 I think you can still 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.629
 Imagine what that means 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.069
 interesting features so I go now 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:49.530
 not at all on this one 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.959
 light field photography related history 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.099
 Selective focus calls it that way 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.349
 subsequently also the 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.639
 can adjust depth of field but how 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.180
 said that would be too far here now 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:59.280
 to lead 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.390
 any amount of changes and for example 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.250
 still noticed 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.140
 in the settings in the settings 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.690
 There are now icons not only 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.370
 these texts as before do not know if that 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.900
 now definitely looks forward to everyone 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.980
 case ever fancier from but 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.810
 maybe one or the other does 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.510
 then somehow easier you have to 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.950
 Let's see very nice device I can 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.350
 Unfortunately, not the gods feel 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.030
 judge because unfortunately there are only here 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.760
 these leashed devices 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:27.150
 That's why I'll just say 73x 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:30.450
 142 millimeters at 81 millimeters is yes 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.280
 not much and so I can 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.470
 Now only say I believe that 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.150
 so that's really nice and easy in 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.919
 hand would be but you have to 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.180
 then times with the final device really 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:39.950
 Try again for sales 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.880
 to confirm 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.650
 Now I want to briefly to the 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.570
 circuit once more beautiful on this 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.450
 come back part that's called 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:51.060
 greed is fit as you can easily see 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.650
 A bracelet can be a fitness trackers 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.360
 down here you can see the electronics 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.930
 for example, to the heart rate too 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.910
 but measure first 27 grams of weight 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.830
 I found it easy to overturn 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.480
 I can take this out of here 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.680
 So accordingly, the bracelets 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.910
 replace it in different 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.280
 colors are there 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.380
 and of course there will be 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.150
 of course all sorts of apps too 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.010
 this help it already 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.510
 preinstalled was supposed to be drilled on it 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:20.580
 were almost everything offer what the 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.900
 sports friend needs here on the device 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.090
 and right here I have this 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.350
 by the way, super amoled display bent 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.729
 Of course samsung did that now 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.490
 do not take note 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:33.720
 this is the first curved arched one 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:35.880
 super lcd super amoled display is the 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.240
 world and of course touchscreen completely 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.160
 clear 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.770
 that means I have notifications here 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.600
 I have remote control for media here 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.570
 everything you can imagine and 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.669
 as said sport raid and what knows 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.530
 I and click on top of it then have 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:51.330
 I again with normal display 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.880
 clock and of course a fine one 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:56.010
 things prices that would be good too 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.919
 Unfortunately samsung did not mention that 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:00.930
 neither for the beer fit nor for the s5 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:02.820
 only the date the yes, but even 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.190
 something eleventh april 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:08.100
 both devices should be in stock from the first april 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.669
 Nearly 150 countries worldwide available 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.320
 his 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:12.090
 and you have to wait and see 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.040
 at what price you are allowed 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.270
 be curious I think that's enough 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:20.780
 now as a first impression 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:20.780
 samsung galaxy s 5 and s gier fit
