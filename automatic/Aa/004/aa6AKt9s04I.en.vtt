00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:59.010
 sees a shadow reflected on her eyes 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.510
 mail if you said yes but as he said 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.800
 conrad how do i explain to 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.440
 wife when I look out of the 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.000
 window I'm working 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:10.200
 that is, when I'm suffering, I work this 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:17.610
 is the absence 18 days that says them 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:18.810

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.840
 elisa 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.360
 and what they are looking for becomes a space 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.050
 for us because it is military and there are none 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.050
 punctuation points 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.900
 but it cancels them salvation 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.730
 everyone remembers something from cadet marzia 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.920
 no points are inclined when precisely to 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:04:00.820
 French base things that even when they are 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.820

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.210
 certain conjunctives seem to be my daughter 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.610
 use the subjunctive when he has to tell 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:16.880
 fairy tales there was a princess 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:20.600
 time if I were to eat abysses 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.769
 something in the pink fridge was random 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.320

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.610
 part will be with the father but tries to 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.810
 specify that you did not miss because 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.950
 he was with his father and then me dad of madrid 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.130

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:10.850
 fairy tales where the princess type 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.500
 it depends by force is not totally 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.360
 subordinate to the prince charming 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.220
 so don't tell any fable and 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.140
 the thing I still remained thick in 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:23.840
 mum cries turns into one 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:26.150
 once a thing says but I type the 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.790

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.930
