00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
really move his arms up because of the

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.270 
really move his arms up because of the
slow<00:01:48.509> leaves<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.740> can<00:01:49.950> see<00:01:50.220> sure<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.820> can

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
because there are no sleeves but I think

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.010 
because there are no sleeves but I think
the<00:01:56.280> sleeves<00:01:56.549> were<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.880> nice<00:01:57.119> part<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.659> keep<00:01:57.840> it

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
the sleeves were a nice part to keep it

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.109 
the sleeves were a nice part to keep it

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
kind of different from this Undertaker

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.069 
kind of different from this Undertaker
from<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.630> Elite<00:02:01.020> Series<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.640> great
