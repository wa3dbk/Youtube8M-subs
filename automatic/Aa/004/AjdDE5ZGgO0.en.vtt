but<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:36.780> think<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.109> referee<00:00:37.499> here<00:00:37.679> overruling

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
but I think the referee here overruling

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.520 
but I think the referee here overruling
the<00:00:38.609> linesman<00:00:39.120> particularly<00:00:39.659> when<00:00:40.079> we<00:00:40.230> saw<00:00:40.409> it

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
the linesman particularly when we saw it

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.649 
the linesman particularly when we saw it
made<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:40.859> blatant<00:00:41.429> error<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.909> few<00:00:42.329> minutes

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:42.659 
made that blatant error a few minutes

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:44.809 
made that blatant error a few minutes
ago<00:00:42.780> but<00:00:43.260> everyone<00:00:43.739> stopped<00:00:44.129> including<00:00:44.699> you

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:44.819 
ago but everyone stopped including you

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:46.160 
ago but everyone stopped including you
and<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.089> guess<00:00:45.390> we<00:00:45.510> didn't<00:00:45.690> quite<00:00:45.899> know<00:00:45.960> what

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
and I I guess we didn't quite know what

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.619 
and I I guess we didn't quite know what
was<00:00:46.319> going<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:46.829> salt<00:00:47.159> is<00:00:47.370> absolutely<00:00:48.300> furious

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
was going on salt is absolutely furious

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.569 
was going on salt is absolutely furious
I<00:00:49.050> think<00:00:49.589> when<00:00:49.739> we<00:00:49.859> look<00:00:49.889> back<00:00:50.190> on<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.489> the

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
I think when we look back on it the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.029 
I think when we look back on it the
decision<00:00:50.999> was<00:00:51.120> correct<00:00:51.300> but<00:00:52.139> as<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.379> say<00:00:52.559> no

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
decision was correct but as you say no

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.829 
decision was correct but as you say no

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
Baumann who who basically stopped did

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.330

leak<00:01:15.140> well<00:01:16.140> that's<00:01:16.320> hard<00:01:16.590> just<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.039> couple<00:01:17.219> of

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
leak well that's hard just a couple of

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.830 
leak well that's hard just a couple of

trouble<00:01:21.359> as<00:01:21.899> well<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.409> think<00:01:23.130> there's<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.520> fair

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
trouble as well I think there's a fair

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.039 
trouble as well I think there's a fair
amount<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:24.060> patience<00:01:24.450> going<00:01:24.630> on<00:01:24.780> here<00:01:24.930> from

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
amount of patience going on here from

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.029 
amount of patience going on here from
the<00:01:25.140> referee<00:01:25.439> though<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.710> think<00:01:25.979> he

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
the referee though I think he

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.940 
the referee though I think he
understands<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.880> frustration<00:01:27.479> but<00:01:28.229> the

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
understands the frustration but the

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.969 
understands the frustration but the
point<00:01:29.219> is<00:01:29.899> there<00:01:30.899> was<00:01:31.200> no<00:01:31.380> offside<00:01:31.530> there

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
point is there was no offside there

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.499 
point is there was no offside there
where<00:01:32.159> did<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.340> license<00:01:32.759> plate<00:01:32.969> go<00:01:33.149> of<00:01:33.329> course

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
player there but that's that it was

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.000 
player there but that's that it was
silly<00:01:41.900> it<00:01:42.050> was<00:01:42.080> like<00:01:42.290> training<00:01:42.740> ground

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
silly it was like training ground

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.670 
silly it was like training ground
everyone<00:01:43.340> stopped<00:01:43.960> there<00:01:44.960> was<00:01:44.990> a<00:01:45.110> point<00:01:45.440> where

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
everyone stopped there was a point where

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.890 
everyone stopped there was a point where
it<00:01:45.800> came<00:01:45.980> up<00:01:46.190> a<00:01:46.310> doorman<00:01:46.610> perfect<00:01:47.060> that's<00:01:47.270> why

it came up a doorman perfect that's why

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.110 
it came up a doorman perfect that's why
five-o<00:01:48.260> think<00:01:48.500> it<00:01:48.620> was<00:01:48.770> offside<00:01:49.220> big<00:01:49.610> hour<00:01:49.790> it

five-o think it was offside big hour it

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.970 
five-o think it was offside big hour it
was<00:01:50.240> definitely<00:01:50.600> a<00:01:50.660> back<00:01:50.960> pass<00:01:51.290> it<00:01:51.590> was<00:01:51.740> a<00:01:51.770> back
