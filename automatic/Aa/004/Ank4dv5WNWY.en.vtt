00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.940
 Normally, mobile phones are a huge camera 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.349
 Quality used 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.459
 five more pixels or, in the case of expensive smartphones, 8 megapixels 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:18.220
 meanwhile almost as standard to call 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.550
 that's where the Zeil Mega Pixel disco beats fall for sure 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.439
 filmed rek APA 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.759
 and even if it's just a beginner's phone in quotes 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.619
 Samsung would certainly have a least three point two pixel camera 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.220
 can install 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.160
 even the predecessor could camera moderately 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.110
 Not fully visited convince 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.110
 then you can be Mega Pixel but that is no wonder 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.899
 my rating sounds really bad 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.230
 but you have to really accept the Corby 2 so that the 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:56.790
 Photos are not too expensive to be photographic about the wings 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.550
 than it will be 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.840
 In any case, not separating Hermann which is not especially disturbing is that it 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.830
 no separate trigger button but that you really only here on 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.250
 the top 10 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.390
 can trigger 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.920
 when and Vach Asus sets 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.960
 also nice and sharp 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.610
 then that is just these from LÃ¼beck release delay is 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.190
 then, of course, too 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.260
 can cause problems, I hope he can recognize that the color reproduction 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.370
 even at a normal light conditions and in closed 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.770
 It's not the best thing to improve 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.940
 not because it is not 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.050
 Pletz gives 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.060
 however, and that is definitely convenient 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.499
 There is not only here to ship all sorts of options now 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.980
 but also here 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.310
 as you can see under Settings there is a self-timer white balance 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.320
 everything imaginable 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.590
 By the way, the same applies to twelve videos 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.509
 as you can see here 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.539
 Trader's opinions can be recognized better 

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:15.259
 around 

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:18.929
 So it's always one of those with fast movements 

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:22.739
 Pixel veil and of course you see that the first ride 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.739
 Play anything does not look too good 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:31.029
 Obama, of course I wanted to follow you 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:34.249
 Show music Clair 

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:36.439
 you can find it here 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:39.579
 and he just has her over 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:41.489
 the most typical 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.579
 and on Zicke could Samsung 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.579
 to be his 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.769
 I just play something from 8 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:11.169
 So he heard a total 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:14.409
 the sound is definitely convincing though I still am 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:15.920
 always ask if Parum 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.239
 the speakers are always positioned on the back 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.739
 In any case, the sound is definitely clear 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:23.769
 and balanced
