00:00:01.119 --> 00:00:05.180
 Hey guys, Flex is the father of poker and it's about time again 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.989
 explained for a new episode for the video 

00:00:07.989 --> 00:00:09.070
 this week 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.460
 is at the start 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.120
 for the trucker user top move on the more 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:13.900
 one hand 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.979
 has sent 

00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:18.050
 Ahmann in the end ten table 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.339
 important to note 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:20.499
 every player 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:22.039
 that would have cells 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.339
 Hartge posts Smoot and big players 10 10 in the pot 5 cents 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:28.509
 you never cover that 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:30.130
 and 2 balders 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.520
 sits with Dennis Quaid of South 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.940
 and thus by this post Demels Hiltons unfortunately does not attract 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.940
 the big stand for Value Path is bringing 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.230
 five big bands are relatively uncommon who are not normal too 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.300
 new but with a large the Dettmann Esen 50 cents here as 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.839
 Measured good in any case 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:48.749
 We also want value for the screen 

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:52.719
 and there are corners to access the app so always nice juicy limits 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.020
 and the big band of the time 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.920
 in order to get on the big band the tour at Garner Stelle had no further info or 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.680
 Miz 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.539
 at 19 o'clock few statistics also for ten hands 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.310
 that is incredibly meaningful now that we have cameras too 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.210
 from negligent 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.540
 on the four-cylinder, the Spider has played 30 percent to the end and was 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.980
 relatively fake-accounts goal has played in the hands 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:15.990
 OM but 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.009
 that can of course mean a lot and poor on 14 end 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:20.580
 Percent you really can not do that 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.930
 why can not he? 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.690
 when they are not accurate 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.450
 the great role model 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.450
 and the quick trips 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.900
 which is always nice 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.370
 conflict research 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.660
 and the opponent checks 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.480
 and o at the Conti asks 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.650
 for the Conti which manufacturers put very well actual also from the 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.280
 Size well chosen because 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.070
 he had asked me if he ever set band world to small or it 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.350
 not sure about that 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.840
 and I think so too 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.749
 hijacked texture is actually already 

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:53.070
 Percent very cheap is as small as possible to beds because you just want 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.649
 that the opponent also really bad end raven on Astras 7 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.180
 To keep the Ticino com worse some opponents 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.200
 In the evening times who even sometimes not wrong here the flop Heinze 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.810
 check 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.240
 the aggressive opponent 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.810
 because then the beginning to take their initiative and their complete 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.950
 missed take and there are so massive here so something like 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.629
 19 jack ten ladies book became king lady 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:20.099
 King biscuit Dominique Strauss-Kahn 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.980
 5 6 2 2 l to test four un-soldiers 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.330
 All these hands then maybe start to turn bloody one way 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.079
 usually comes 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:30.329
 it is flat straw 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:34.329
 Bundesliga without 7 but these are always very small parts of the 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:36.280
 opposing half in boots 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.960
 with which the opponent then gives us action around those wars but late 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.279
 probably something else we do not have to worry about 

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:46.779
 to really get a lot of value on this brisk Erich that lies 

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:50.770
 but just in the nature of things when you flop trips and the word quasi 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.580
 So completely taken the ProTour at the here 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.400
 then it is hardly possible for the opponent to get worse and worse 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.509
 Thus, the opponent palaces produce seven-haired modern pocket pair 

00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:03.029
 He will perhaps give us another action, but more than that 

00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:04.829
 with son and I say so 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.439
 a warm blanket now underground Burkhard 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:11.669
 and we beds again sunken 7 or pox viruses Schmeisser directly so 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:14.539
 We will certainly not get the stacks in as long as the opponent 

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:15.709
 History Passau has and 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.620
 worsen as a warrior variety 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.519
 but of course it covers here 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.919
 very good, but I am the welcome kick 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:25.189
 and the opponent Colt Thönnes now the bottle 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:28.459
 and the opponent checks again and the question is now if you have beds or 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.249
 should check 

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:34.499
 you can do both I would say you can find beds for value in the 

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:37.709
 Hope that a worse paid one can also beds in the 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.989
 Hope that the opponent now paid even more with a simply in Cairo because 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.439
 it is more likely that he might be in his hand whatever 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:44.940
 had bad luck in or whatever 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.219
 that has a check 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:49.659
 um, though, if a flashcard us Cech West Ham was the tricky one 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:50.739
 situation 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.689
 and we really want to avoid that 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:55.979
 which makes sense with aggressive players because not so sure if he is there 

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:58.110
 happy to have a bottle or not 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.219
 there would have to pay more we would have to decide on the basis of the measured variable 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:04.050
 it was not good anymore 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.810
 you can still grain but overall, the opponent then asks us Peiner 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.070
 should spill 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.660
 full difficult comit with engaging way both the Township Lasko and the 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:13.209
 opponent 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.329
 around the won and despite being used as Betty Heidler, Sanomat's mated son 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.709
 over twenty or thirty or forty Rome to size 1 50 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.120
 and the opponent Cech West then he has almost split his whole deck 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.099
 and we 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.520
 we run the risk of playing DAX right away 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.520
 and that makes the last three games and and two assists happy 

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:35.039
 Wissmann was superior for what movie about breaks and that's basically 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:37.449
 really the worse ones 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:40.830
 I think here's a good way to assess Pether's approach 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.840
 like this 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.980
 For example, he also lets exactly the hands of which I just spoke on the flop 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.980
 the USA Malcolm Pocket Foursome Trier that Doppelsechser just once 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.349
 or maybe Qinghai proves 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:56.009
 It leaves those very hands in it and may cause the opponent to do so 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:57.639
 Möhrer again a log cabin place 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.229
 and plan 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:00.770
 the opponent is also bedding over it 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:01.969
 that happens too 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:03.620
 and oh weia Colt 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.789
 and I find that hand so far 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:08.949
 from a technical point of view, played absolutely okay 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:12.189
 Percent without further information about the opponent it is always difficult the 

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:15.639
 Optimum decision to make if you could get more value out somewhere 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:16.139
 can 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:19.600
 or maybe you should have beds at some point 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:20.400
 the trip 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.229
 Neumayr Value and so on 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:23.520
 maybe you could too 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.760
 the only option i still very around 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.770
 if you look out of the worse value or outward 7 or more 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.529
 something like pocket eights for example 

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:32.909
 then you can visit the boulevard of small creatures 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:34.980
 this is not a bad option for me 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.419
 the opponent bets a dollar 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:37.910
 and we know like that 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:39.960
 the 2 50 2 80 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.830
 if the opponent then pushes rolls 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.540
 Hamann local Follett because he simply offers five bottles of wine and one 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:46.599
 you can not beat that 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:48.419
 but that would be the value 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:49.879
 theoretically still there 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:51.400
 as a standard 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.759
 without further information as well as opponents find but Kolloch does not wrong 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:57.979
 and that's exactly what the 2 at the manufacturer did 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:05:58.969
 and has become 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:02.419
 Show bottle 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:06.610
 I think Red biggest was the biggest concern then the flop turns out and that 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.740
 is that we have been too small, I think that one thinks so very much 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.440
 result oriented often one thinks now i have bedded so little flop 

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:16.229
 There the opponent pulled his lock so you can not think like that when you 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:18.940
 Courses would have wagered if he had flashed Rollig fouled 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.720
 Reporters have become even bigger 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.630
 and and and 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.240
 the decisions would have stayed the same as if nothing had happened 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.119
 changed for you 

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:29.360
 so Abdullah that is not better or more or more Protected 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.360
 that you could have bet a little bit bigger on the flop as well 

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:34.819
 a total of 

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:38.669
 if you go through the Procom Minato reverse mathematically are just too 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:40.770
 little hands "that can give the action 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.990
 Suppose the word becomes something like that 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.830
 Lady Po Bullen new two bottles on such a board so that Suri is big 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.319
 Chains because the number of hands that give the action just so the numerous 

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:52.619
 is big and thereby generates more value 

00:06:52.619 --> 00:06:55.969
 it makes sense to bed "but on such a flop texture 

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:01.409
 makes no difference and it is even better to make her smaller 

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:02.229
 put 

00:07:02.229 --> 00:07:04.960
 So I hope I could answer with the question 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.469
 under the hand is played perfectly okay as I said the subject quality 

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:13.639
 Flop Batti's good numbers you can get beds but then you just got heavy 

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:16.819
 Decision if the opponent Cech West and one stands of OCO with middle between 

00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:20.110
 and you want to avoid that easily the healthy information 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.430
 Check Back Adventure No I okay 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.760
 and Ambühl might be a little make up and then if the opponent and 

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:26.860
 India should follow 

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.259
 to make the little rest just for value from poorer ate 

00:07:30.259 --> 00:07:34.110
 Foreign daughter 7 who believes in herself expressed and so on 

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:37.740
 a total of 

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.740
 maybe with little things 

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:41.919
 and flopped perfectly okay 

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:45.120
 the wars of her for this week up to six times type
