 Dear 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.430
 hi to all I have just been according to 4 in this video I will show you my 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.209
 generator I say this 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:17.269
 this tower hotel can produce up to 292 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.570
 thor cubes this world 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.060
 and at that time these female soldier pistons would have been useful 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.730
 only that an extract is designed and therefore not tolerated is black 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:33.989
 and then when if you want to reproduce generator cost 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.190
 together for difficult cars because 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.230
 amulets 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.510
 sarzana much rainstorm 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.870
 and anyway I advise you to do what I did I have a 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.190
 nabucco immediately after the christ in sleep 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.520
 tool for operated 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.590
 and I will destroy all the winner 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.810
 air 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.140
 savoca them and lara 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.910
 u ... 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.560
 videoclip ralston karieva wrongdoing operated generator 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.460
 and operates national prandelli 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.220
 block 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.580
 making front pistons forward backward business time right because breast 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.570
 I can't get the ciampistore, loving you behind does not produce a cube of its own 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.620
 history 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.180
 he is that we can drive to 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.880
 the questore generator 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.880
 where i can see it works a little 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.180
 hotel or five lands 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.930
 pull the lever 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.250
 eldo 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.250
 text turns off starts to produce 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.400
 but how am I better 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.650
 east 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.979
 when the sport couple will come from that there 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:49.870
 own 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.190
 gunslinger 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.780
 el piston said no one behind 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.030
 we are more push forward I know it because weight is available 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.830
 but they can push forward 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.990
 up to 12 cubes 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.490
 is 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.909
 and therefore I will not be able to anymore 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.220
 'wonder ahead 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.220
 double absorbent drug 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.709
 spit 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.290
 I have never tried to put it all rivarolo massa cupped city of cubes but 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.199
 I think it takes me quite a while 

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:21.629
 I had to do an extra key 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.730
 that I move that row over 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.869
 that dwarf 

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:30.879
 but these pistons quote for what I see this minute cost of wine hours 

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:34.779
 the torrent conspiracy of this life here 

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:38.059
 nao falo cuasso in mind. counterproject corrado delitto 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:42.209
 then I press this button 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.519
 and I move my daughter 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.519
 we prepare this moves it upwards 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:51.619
 start to reproduce beam novo no 

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:54.229
 but how are you 

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:57.229
 translator 

00:02:58.499 --> 00:03:01.509
 and go on like this until you fill the 12 stringers in height 

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:05.259
 so we have if the file 

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:10.880
 if the files 11 long delicacy 2c then if for 11 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.379
 for 12 fastweb 192 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:16.940
 let's say you could also do a lot more much more files when you do 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:18.039
 they want 

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:21.109
 only that I had you who wants to say toshiba the problem of 

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:23.739
 the material 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.739
 I who am then I know that I can do whatever he wants. 

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:30.619
 and they are little forlani men 

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:32.100
 rm 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.100
 then things and Paolo Sorrentino save it 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:38.869
 king 

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:41.869
 then little principle of retirement stratocaster moderator 

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:48.129
 is a partition created the palette a sorcerer rank 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:52.789
 then when I operate it raises their alcohol clock apk 

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:55.600
 I form it I open it this is true even after that 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.419
 when I quiver 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:00.339
 who's this 

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:04.649
 then sink signal signal coming to these repeaters 

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:09.389
 now you need to know which repeaters can transmit inside cubes 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:10.909
 of various materials separately 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:12.560
 the glass seems to me. 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.999
 bags are other people 

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:19.120
 and therefore synonymous inside the cube architecture is transmitted after 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.910
 repeater after it sends this gloomy and so on until the end of the penis 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.009
 perfect you could do it you have to edit the photos 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:27.860
 what is it and why 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.860
 king sun I must do 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:34.680
 I'm not very red - demonstration 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.930
 the 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.000
 so when it operates this when salting the water inside stone drives 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.749
 absurd decolletes 

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:44.900
 as I say this name 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.900
 we go towards 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:54.240
 and so it worked this way it's very simple too and how 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.129
 circuit 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:59.129
 even 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:01.350
 greetings 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.750
 thanks for viewing video etc.
