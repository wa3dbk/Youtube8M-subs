contents and I just renamed one to the

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.979 
contents and I just renamed one to the
dev<00:00:49.860> folder<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:51.149> way<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.300> can<00:00:51.510> differentiate

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
dev folder that way I can differentiate

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.130 
dev folder that way I can differentiate
the<00:00:52.320> two<00:00:52.640> so<00:00:53.640> once<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:53.940> have<00:00:54.059> pasted<00:00:54.600> your

the two so once you have pasted your

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.770 
the two so once you have pasted your
worth<00:00:55.620> under<00:00:55.860> folder<00:00:56.280> copy<00:00:56.660> wherever<00:00:57.660> you

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
worth under folder copy wherever you

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.529 
worth under folder copy wherever you
want<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.050> go<00:00:58.559> into<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.309> what<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.329> want<00:01:00.480> to

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
want it go into it and what you want to

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.709 
want it go into it and what you want to
do<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.989> right-click<00:01:01.340> select<00:01:02.340> new<00:01:02.730> text

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
do is right-click select new text

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.600 
do is right-click select new text
document<00:01:04.970> and<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.930> want<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.530> make<00:01:07.619> this<00:01:07.860> name<00:01:08.460> it

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
document and I want to make this name it

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.070 
document and I want to make this name it
matching<00:01:09.090> dev<00:01:09.270> mode<00:01:09.420> like<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:09.750> one<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.049> see

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
matching dev mode like this one you see

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.740 
matching dev mode like this one you see
here<00:01:11.750> so<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:13.049> matching<00:01:13.500> capital<00:01:14.280> D

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
here so this is matching capital D

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.899 
here so this is matching capital D
capital<00:01:15.750> M<00:01:15.840> just<00:01:16.140> like<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.740> then<00:01:17.610> which

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
capital M just like that and then which

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.510 
capital M just like that and then which
do<00:01:18.119> click<00:01:18.540> on<00:01:18.689> rename<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.380> then<00:01:19.890> remove<00:01:20.130> dot

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
do click on rename and then remove dot
