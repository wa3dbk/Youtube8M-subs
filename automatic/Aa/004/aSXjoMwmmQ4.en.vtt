00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.359
 at the advanced level 1013 is from the 17th 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.239
 from June and until the 30 we have 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:35.050
 basically two weeks 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.850
 differentiated by the activity that 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.879
 characterizes the first week of 17 to 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.040
 23 is the week dedicated to all 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.920
 educational activities and what we want 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.530
 is that people can approach the 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.879
 dance from a more experimental way 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.640
 let's say you can see classes of 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.190
 flamenco ballet tango that 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.070
 children can even start 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.229
 let's say to relate with the dance of 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.180
 one from a closer and already 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:04.129
 then the second week they start 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.619
 the shows in the squares on the 26th 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.689
 and until June 30 we have 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.689
 designed a whole series of shows 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:13.420
 5 places in the 5 municipalities where 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.250
 the spectators will be able to enjoy 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.930
 different dance styles in each 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.119
 of these shows that people 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.960
 feel that the dance is not something far away 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.270
 that is not something foreign 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.940
 the advance is something that belongs to us that 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.060
 culturally the Venezuelan has very 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.100
 s children close to us somehow 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.900
 everyone learns to dance though 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.770
 then enjoy it or not even if it's something 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.690
 that is that you do daily or not 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.580
 simply part of our 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.009
 culture then what we did in the 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.850
 framework of the 2013 festival was to commission 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.979
 works 33 specific works that were 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.450
 created for public space then 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.979
 each of these choreographies of the 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.250
 different styles of dance like you 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.789
 said neoclassical contemporary flamenco 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:03.479
 traditional urban tango and theater dance 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:05.610
 and they are doing choreography that 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.530
 adapt to the architecture of space 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.289
 that also play a little with the 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.630
 presence of the public so close and that 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.989
 interact with that with all those 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.130
 elements that the street has and that's a 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.350
 little what you will be able to enjoy the 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.180
 people when they approach the squares the 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.180
 next week from 26 to 30
