brakes everything's ready to go get in
to<00:00:12.780> start<00:00:13.139> it<00:00:13.820> won't<00:00:14.820> turn<00:00:15.030> on<00:00:15.289> so<00:00:16.289> we<00:00:16.770> hook<00:00:17.430> up

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
to start it won't turn on so we hook up

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.550 
to start it won't turn on so we hook up
the<00:00:17.640> battery<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.359> charger<00:00:19.140> over<00:00:19.260> there

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
the battery to the charger over there

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.640 
the battery to the charger over there
and<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:20.820> has<00:00:21.029> its<00:00:21.270> real<00:00:21.570> violent<00:00:22.199> clicking

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
and it has its real violent clicking

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.769 
and it has its real violent clicking
noise<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:23.609> it<00:00:23.699> hangs<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:24.029> Saul<00:00:24.269> annoyed<00:00:24.570> in

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779

it was so rusted on there that a piece
of<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.930> solenoid<00:00:52.199> broke<00:00:52.800> off<00:00:54.530> that's<00:00:55.530> my

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.840 
of the solenoid broke off that's my
thermostat<00:00:56.129> in<00:00:56.430> there<00:00:56.550> too<00:00:56.820> tiny<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.210> replace

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
thermostat in there too tiny to replace

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.520 
thermostat in there too tiny to replace

but uh my dad's under here he's gonna
show<00:01:09.830> that's<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.979> starter<00:01:13.070> this<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.400> piece

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
show that's the starter this is a piece

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.960 
show that's the starter this is a piece
it<00:01:15.000> broke<00:01:15.299> up<00:01:15.479> here<00:01:15.720> by<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.900> solenoid<00:01:16.590> but

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
it broke up here by the solenoid but

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.460 
it broke up here by the solenoid but
since<00:01:17.970> we<00:01:18.090> were<00:01:18.240> replacing<00:01:18.450> anyway<00:01:19.140> it's<00:01:19.320> no

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
since we were replacing anyway it's no

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.190 
since we were replacing anyway it's no
big<00:01:19.680> deal<00:01:19.710> then<00:01:20.490> told<00:01:20.790> ah<00:01:20.970> how<00:01:21.119> exhausting<00:01:22.049> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
big deal then told ah how exhausting the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.100 
big deal then told ah how exhausting the
way<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.439> get<00:01:22.890> out<00:01:23.159> well<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.090> exhaust<00:01:24.420> one<00:01:24.990> of

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
way to get out well the exhaust one of

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.679 
way to get out well the exhaust one of
the<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:26.189> originally<00:01:26.790> was<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.939> dual<00:01:27.240> exhaust

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
the this originally was a dual exhaust

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:36.859 
the this originally was a dual exhaust
now<00:01:28.140> it's<00:01:31.759> come<00:01:32.759> out<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:34.610> muffler<00:01:35.610> but<00:01:36.390> as<00:01:36.659> you

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
now it's come out the muffler but as you

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.319 
now it's come out the muffler but as you
can<00:01:36.990> see<00:01:37.049> there<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.759> exhaust<00:01:38.759> pipes<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.240> the

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
can see there that exhaust pipes in the

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.690 
can see there that exhaust pipes in the
way<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:39.540> we'll<00:01:40.439> pretty<00:01:40.770> much<00:01:40.950> try<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.369> do<00:01:41.549> is

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
way so we'll pretty much try to do is

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.480 
way so we'll pretty much try to do is
take<00:01:41.909> out<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.119> story<00:01:42.570> as<00:01:42.869> best<00:01:43.140> we<00:01:43.200> can<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.920> if

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
take out the story as best we can and if

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.330 
take out the story as best we can and if
we<00:01:44.549> can't<00:01:44.970> pry<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.689> up<00:01:45.899> tomorrow<00:01:46.079> we<00:01:46.950> own<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.250> up

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
we can't pry it up tomorrow we own it up

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.520 
we can't pry it up tomorrow we own it up
to<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.610> shop<00:01:47.909> so<00:01:48.600> we<00:01:48.720> can<00:01:48.750> get<00:01:49.020> up<00:01:49.110> on<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.350> lift

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
to the shop so we can get up on the lift

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.190 
to the shop so we can get up on the lift
and<00:01:49.680> then<00:01:49.829> remove<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.399> exhaust<00:01:50.810> or<00:01:51.810> if<00:01:51.930> we<00:01:52.020> can

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
and then remove the exhaust or if we can

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:00.819 
and then remove the exhaust or if we can
do<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.409> from<00:01:52.680> under<00:01:52.979> here<00:01:53.399> I'm<00:01:53.640> not<00:01:53.939> real<00:01:54.180> sure

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.280 

they're<00:02:01.829> probably<00:02:02.040> like<00:02:02.340> right<00:02:02.610> there<00:02:03.290> that

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
they're probably like right there that

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.809 
they're probably like right there that
bracket<00:02:05.750> so<00:02:06.750> uh<00:02:06.780> yeah<00:02:08.000> restoration

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
bracket so uh yeah restoration

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.720 
bracket so uh yeah restoration
