00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
disappointed with mainly the killstreaks

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.289 
disappointed with mainly the killstreaks
I<00:01:06.500> was<00:01:07.500> hoping<00:01:08.040> I'd<00:01:08.280> be<00:01:08.430> able<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.790> customize

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
I was hoping I'd be able to customize

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.710 
I was hoping I'd be able to customize
those<00:01:09.570> weeks<00:01:09.930> per<00:01:10.409> class<00:01:10.880> but<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.479> doesn't

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
those weeks per class but that doesn't

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.690 
those weeks per class but that doesn't
really<00:01:12.960> matter<00:01:13.260> but<00:01:13.950> I'm<00:01:14.100> disappointed

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
really matter but I'm disappointed

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.399 
really matter but I'm disappointed
because<00:01:14.790> till<00:01:15.180> streets<00:01:15.509> are<00:01:15.689> pretty<00:01:16.170> much

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
because till streets are pretty much

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.109 
because till streets are pretty much
broken<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:17.390> mean<00:01:18.390> really<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.990> see<00:01:19.310> mainly<00:01:20.310> go

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
broken I mean really you see mainly go

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.109 
broken I mean really you see mainly go
streets<00:01:21.450> like<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:22.130> Harrier<00:01:23.130> air<00:01:23.460> strike<00:01:23.850> and

streets like the Harrier air strike and

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.780

the<00:01:24.960> chopper<00:01:25.259> gunner<00:01:25.619> those<00:01:26.340> are<00:01:26.580> probably

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
the chopper gunner those are probably

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.910 
the chopper gunner those are probably
the<00:01:26.970> most<00:01:27.060> broken<00:01:27.570> ones<00:01:28.100> and<00:01:30.170> it's<00:01:31.170> really<00:01:31.680> not

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
the most broken ones and it's really not

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.149 
the most broken ones and it's really not
there<00:01:32.310> because<00:01:32.549> they're<00:01:32.939> pretty<00:01:33.630> easy<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:35.009> get

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
there because they're pretty easy to get

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.810 
there because they're pretty easy to get
kills<00:01:35.460> with<00:01:35.729> in<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.329> short<00:01:36.659> amount<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:37.020> time<00:01:37.820> so

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
killstreaks if you get a care package

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.100 
killstreaks if you get a care package
and<00:02:23.400> then<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:23.880> get<00:02:24.000> like<00:02:24.180> a<00:02:24.210> pavelow<00:02:24.570> and<00:02:25.020> it

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
and then you get like a pavelow and it

middle so yeah let's do what else I
pretty<00:03:09.450> much<00:03:09.570> like<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.110> small<00:03:10.410> stages

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
pretty much like the small stages

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.800 
pretty much like the small stages
because<00:03:11.100> they're<00:03:11.580> not<00:03:11.760> too<00:03:12.120> small<00:03:12.480> they're

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
because they're not too small they're

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.960 
because they're not too small they're
not<00:03:12.959> too<00:03:13.200> big<00:03:13.440> but<00:03:13.769> they're<00:03:14.400> pretty<00:03:14.580> much<00:03:14.640> for

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
not too big but they're pretty much for

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.990 
not too big but they're pretty much for
the<00:03:15.030> back<00:03:15.239> lots<00:03:15.600> of<00:03:15.930> morrow<00:03:16.680> or<00:03:16.739> two<00:03:17.220> which<00:03:17.970> is

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
the back lots of morrow or two which is

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.330 
the back lots of morrow or two which is

what I like it's a good size map like

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.160 
what I like it's a good size map like
terminal<00:03:20.790> terminals<00:03:21.239> a<00:03:21.269> lot<00:03:21.420> fun<00:03:21.660> to<00:03:21.810> play<00:03:21.959> on

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170

and as you can see the guns other
they're<00:03:48.600> slightly<00:03:48.870> more<00:03:49.200> balanced<00:03:49.739> in

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
they're slightly more balanced in

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.220 
they're slightly more balanced in
comparison<00:03:50.730> to<00:03:50.850> each<00:03:50.940> other<00:03:51.209> they<00:03:51.959> are

when<00:04:59.170> I<00:04:59.230> stood<00:04:59.740> under<00:04:59.980> it<00:05:00.190> wait<00:05:00.400> for<00:05:00.430> it<00:05:00.700> to

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
when I stood under it wait for it to

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.900 
when I stood under it wait for it to
come<00:05:01.030> and<00:05:01.330> then<00:05:01.840> just<00:05:02.020> fell<00:05:02.320> on<00:05:02.350> my<00:05:02.650> head<00:05:02.890> and<00:05:03.160> I

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
come and then just fell on my head and I

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.880 
come and then just fell on my head and I
died<00:05:04.210> and<00:05:04.510> making<00:05:04.750> the<00:05:04.840> bridge<00:05:05.050> foot<00:05:05.440> and

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
died and making the bridge foot and

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.370 
died and making the bridge foot and
right<00:05:06.520> here<00:05:06.760> they'll<00:05:06.970> spawning<00:05:07.360> to<00:05:07.660> my<00:05:07.750> right

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
right here they'll spawning to my right

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.260 
right here they'll spawning to my right

multiplayer gameplay etc into
consideration<00:05:47.050> sound<00:05:47.850> so<00:05:48.850> I<00:05:49.390> hopefully<00:05:50.200> I'll

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
consideration sound so I hopefully I'll

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.050

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
review and let's see I said I'll start

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.330 
review and let's see I said I'll start
talking<00:05:58.750> about<00:05:58.930> the<00:05:59.020> match<00:05:59.200> i'm<00:05:59.830> using<00:06:00.010> the

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
talking about the match i'm using the

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.660 
talking about the match i'm using the
UNP<00:06:00.910> point<00:06:01.210> 45<00:06:01.720> which<00:06:02.020> is<00:06:02.110> probably<00:06:02.380> the<00:06:02.830> best

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:03.670 
UNP point 45 which is probably the best

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.770 
UNP point 45 which is probably the best

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:11.139 
in the game the other one would probably

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:14.190 
in the game the other one would probably
be<00:06:11.260> the<00:06:11.410> MP<00:06:11.740> thought<00:06:12.010> on<00:06:12.460> the<00:06:12.610> mp5k<00:06:13.200> that's

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:14.200 
be the MP thought on the mp5k that's

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.140 
be the MP thought on the mp5k that's
pretty<00:06:14.380> good<00:06:14.560> none<00:06:14.800> but<00:06:15.040> the<00:06:15.460> recoil<00:06:15.910> with<00:06:16.060> the

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150 
pretty good none but the recoil with the

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.270 
pretty good none but the recoil with the
red<00:06:16.300> dioxide<00:06:16.750> is<00:06:16.870> simply<00:06:17.169> unbearable<00:06:17.440> yeah

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 
red dioxide is simply unbearable yeah

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.550 
red dioxide is simply unbearable yeah
probably<00:06:18.730> put<00:06:18.970> the<00:06:19.060> p90<00:06:19.690> that's<00:06:20.050> pretty<00:06:20.380> good

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
probably put the p90 that's pretty good

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.120 
probably put the p90 that's pretty good
