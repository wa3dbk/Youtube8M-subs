00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
they took it off because I believe

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.520

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
read it and there's that this is what

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.219 
read it and there's that this is what
the<00:01:05.100> website<00:01:05.519> says<00:01:05.820> right<00:01:06.030> now<00:01:06.210> but<00:01:06.479> yesterday

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
the website says right now but yesterday

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.670 
the website says right now but yesterday
or<00:01:07.560> something<00:01:08.040> when<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.700> knees<00:01:08.880> broke<00:01:09.240> out

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680

that's<00:01:10.680> exactly<00:01:11.369> what<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.610> said<00:01:11.820> on<00:01:12.030> the

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.620 
that's exactly what it said on the
website<00:01:13.580> so<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:14.610> guess<00:01:14.939> when<00:01:15.150> they<00:01:15.299> were<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.479> be

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
website so I guess when they were to be

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.330 
website so I guess when they were to be
found<00:01:15.869> out<00:01:16.080> they<00:01:16.290> were<00:01:16.380> like<00:01:16.560> oh<00:01:16.740> just<00:01:17.070> take<00:01:17.250> it

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
off another proof that Batista is
