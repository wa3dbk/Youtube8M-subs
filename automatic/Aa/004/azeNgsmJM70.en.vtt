00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.660
 in the quarterfinals of the NFL cup 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.330
 in spite of the early feyenoord, heart strikes 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.609
 ajax can reach the next 100 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.609

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.309
 who they will world 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.840
 fancy 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.840
 to finish the rover parts 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.410
 it's alright 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.610
 also in the feyenoord competition 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.989
 lead by a goal from 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.579
 graziano pellÃ¨ 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.960
 but Kolbeinn Sigthorsson lead Ajax 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:54.960
 with two goals to victory 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.329
 do you do it for 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.070
 yes it's Sigthorsson again 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.479
 the defeat in the arena meant for 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.460
 feyenoord that we have a bad start to the season 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.440
 in the history of the club 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.930
 never before lost the rotterdammers 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.040
 the first three competition matches 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.080
 in the meantime they have worked themselves up by 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.729
 the fourth place in the ranking with 45 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.380
 points from 25 matches 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.000
 ajax is of course still the 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.979
 leader in the premier league 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.540
 the Amsterdammers have so far achieved 54 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.940
 points and therefore have a head start 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.830
 of six points on close pursuer fc 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.450
 twente 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.830
 next season the classic followed 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.890
 the impressive victory in the champions 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.780
 League at Manchester City Ajax Steven the 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.340
 long lay on a win to the 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.490
 very last minute of the official 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.490
 playtime 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.689
 self 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.210
 last season 's draw 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.860
 meant the twentieth time 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.560
 Feyenoord and Ajax in Rotterdam are the same 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.170
 played from the remaining 37 meetings 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.789
 from ajax to 19 and feyenoord 18 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.220
 the target balance is light and the benefit 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.810
 of the rotterdammers is feyenoord-ajax 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.459
 often a goal duel 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.190
 never ends with the match in 0 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:14.640
 0 in addition, ajax has the last 21 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.440
 eredivisie duels scored in the ajax cockpit 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.599
 has performed well anyway in recent years 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.650
 against Feyenoord from the last 19 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.660
 encounters lost the 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.390
 capitals only one that 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.280
 defeat dates from January 2012 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.910
 feyenoord thanks to three goals from john 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.430
 guidetti with 4 2 won the mayas 119 times 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:36.360
 invading in 1990 thanks to the boy 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:40.190
 Dennis Mountain Camp and various Mountain Camp 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.190
 don't sport something new for pop-up 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.620
 and so on 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.409
 go ajax per portion of dolls successfully 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.379
 for Dennis Bergkamp 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:53.390
 in 1992 in the law of rest right on 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:55.819
 but followed after tea and furious 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:59.049
 Amsterdam porter was sometimes heard there 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.049
 use of the wolves 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.700
 a 10 plus 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.730
 no offside for overmars that costs 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.959
 made mountain logs in the center 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.430
 what he does about mars he does it himself 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.189
 the 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.689
 then first the pot settled by the 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:23.290
 premium in from the field 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:24.519
 marc overmars became the classic in 2001 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.840
 with two and won 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.730
 especially start the books as the 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.889
 competition of the solo by rafael van der 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.410
 speed 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:34.330
 play even further without speed 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.070
 the approach is walking 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.980
 none yes 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.349
 video does 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:45.650
 that glimpse is stiff and becomes like there 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:45.650
 in it with a man less but 2 0 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.850
 in 2006 klaas-jan huntelaar demanded the 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.680
 leading role in the classical for itself 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.360
 current striker of show tunnel 4 scored 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.070
 twice in the match that irons with 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.630
 zero four would win 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.340
 huntelaar scored eight times in total 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.470
 against feyenoord is thus on the 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.760
 10th place a list of all the time before 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.410
 are classical 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.880
 this weekend symbion can also join the 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.460
 add top 10 of that list 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.690
 he needs another hit for this 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:19.600
 sjaak swart is the most surefire 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.600
 player classic 18 volt key 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.460
 ajax this weekend then the 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.050
 disappointment of the shutdown 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.490
 playing the Europa League and 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.569
 good thing to do again in the 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.610
 Premier League 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:37.180
 Feyenoord Ajax starts some afternoon around 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.180
