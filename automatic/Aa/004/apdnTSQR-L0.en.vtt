00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
 alternate also apparently is one of the biggest over costs the comptroller 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.040
 de cali denounced that the giant screen and the chairs of the stage 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.950
 paid more than the mayor Jorge Ivan Ospina says there is no cost overruns 

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:17.279
 According to the Cali comptroller's office, the council approved in November 2009 26 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.820
 one thousand million pesos for the adaptation of the warrior paschal stadium 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.909
 where group b of the U-20 World Cup will be played 

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:26.149
 but this initial budget tripled why more was invested in 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:29.949
 80 billion pesos some councilors say that money comes out 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.579
 of resources destined for other areas the pruning years of a proposed in the 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.120
 mega project 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.690
 uploaded with work and its analysis and these are coming out of other projects 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.350
 who do so but the mayor denies this claim 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.070
 we are not running resources in the stadium 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.680
 from the sport to the comptroller's office worried about the costs of the work 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.830
 giant screen of the stadium has two customs manifests of entry to the 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.719
 country the first part came in 2008 with a cost of 13 thousand 802 dollars 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:07.439
 and the rest I owe in 2009 for 48 thousand 570 dollars 62 thousand 372 dollars that 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.130
 change of the purchase was 149 million 787 thousand pesos but then we go to 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.270
 the invoice 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.470
 to the purchase-sale of the invoice 11 37 where we did not find that the screen 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.649
 Cost according to this invoice 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:26.510
 thousand 300 million pesos the screen is not the most expensive while cheaper 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.810
 is what we could acquire with scarce resources 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.789
 of the municipality the seller explains that the sale is legal yes 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.020
 the customs screen 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.590
 in China 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.250
 and was sold for a certain value here 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.210
 if I have to prove the taxes you pay or for that lack then that this 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.910
 is a market economy and the economy of free designation of the 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.120
 The comptroller also analyzed the purchase of the stadium's silleterÃ­a 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.970
 and elaborated a differentiating table I invite you to send the signal of 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.160
 peri of armenia 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.229
 and compare them with a quality plan and they are the same 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.759
 because it was the same because he delivered it but in Cali cost 72 thousand 900 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:04.289
 pesos 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.390
 almost 40% more than in the other cities a seed which will install 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.549
 at the time yes 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:12.549
 50 thousand pesos with back 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.540
 and now they come to tell us that they need the sun more 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.720
 Comptroller says they are the same ideas 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.120
 but the mayor is based on the quality of these yes I know there are many 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.730
 from a chair luis tysse that there may be a million pesos to a 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.930
 rhymes chair that can be worth 8 thousand pesos 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.170
 The chairs must be valued according to the material used. 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.330
 robustness of the same and the design of the fmi the investigation of the comptroller by 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.910
 the alleged cost overruns of the remodeling of the Easter stadium 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.500
 warrior just begins 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.350
 and analyze also because being a work of this scope did not make the 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.090
 public tender and it was awarded 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.670
 was the figure of abbreviated tender that is unfortunate and that's why we 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.689
 we have said 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:52.999
 that is the friend now to waste
