updates<00:01:28.390> don't<00:01:28.930> get<00:01:29.020> me<00:01:29.140> wrong<00:01:29.170> I<00:01:29.560> knew<00:01:30.009> what<00:01:30.189> I

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
updates don't get me wrong I knew what I

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.310 
updates don't get me wrong I knew what I
bought<00:01:30.549> and<00:01:30.820> I<00:01:30.939> felt<00:01:31.240> more<00:01:31.509> than<00:01:31.659> happy<00:01:31.869> to<00:01:32.200> be

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
bought and I felt more than happy to be

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.160 
bought and I felt more than happy to be
able<00:01:32.500> to<00:01:32.770> support<00:01:32.920> them<00:01:33.430> through<00:01:34.420> this<00:01:34.600> early

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
able to support them through this early

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.230 
able to support them through this early
access<00:01:35.380> program<00:01:35.590> but<00:01:36.550> the<00:01:36.640> problem<00:01:36.790> became

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
access program but the problem became

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.899 
access program but the problem became
visible<00:01:37.750> few<00:01:38.020> months<00:01:38.320> after<00:01:38.710> the<00:01:39.040> purchase<00:01:39.370> I

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
visible few months after the purchase I

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.030 
visible few months after the purchase I
guess<00:01:40.420> you<00:01:40.630> can't<00:01:40.840> really<00:01:40.900> blame<00:01:41.320> zero<00:01:41.740> points

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
guess you can't really blame zero points

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.010 
guess you can't really blame zero points
to<00:01:42.190> do<00:01:42.370> for<00:01:42.640> this<00:01:42.760> either<00:01:43.030> since<00:01:43.510> they<00:01:43.780> are<00:01:43.990> a

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
to do for this either since they are a

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.410 
to do for this either since they are a
very<00:01:44.440> small<00:01:44.800> team<00:01:45.130> but<00:01:45.790> the<00:01:45.909> development

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
very small team but the development

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.330 
very small team but the development
speed<00:01:46.659> of<00:01:46.840> this<00:01:46.990> game<00:01:47.260> was<00:01:47.500> just<00:01:47.740> painfully

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
speed of this game was just painfully

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.490 
speed of this game was just painfully
slow<00:01:48.670> after<00:01:49.360> a<00:01:49.390> few<00:01:49.630> months<00:01:49.810> the<00:01:50.050> only<00:01:50.080> thing

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
slow after a few months the only thing

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.860 
slow after a few months the only thing
they've<00:01:50.680> added<00:01:51.040> were<00:01:51.220> a<00:01:51.250> few<00:01:51.580> pvp<00:01:52.150> maps<00:01:52.420> which

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870 
they've added were a few pvp maps which

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.620 
they've added were a few pvp maps which
I<00:01:53.170> don't<00:01:53.229> even<00:01:53.500> care<00:01:53.890> one<00:01:54.580> assault<00:01:54.940> rifle<00:01:55.330> and

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
I don't even care one assault rifle and

I don't even care one assault rifle and

tons of minor additions and bug fixes

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.510

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
actual code build and I was starting to

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.440 
actual code build and I was starting to
think<00:02:02.920> that<00:02:03.159> interstellar<00:02:03.760> marines<00:02:04.210> is

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
think that interstellar marines is

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.420 
think that interstellar marines is
another<00:02:04.840> prime<00:02:05.170> example<00:02:05.200> of<00:02:05.950> greenlit

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
another prime example of greenlit

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.570 
another prime example of greenlit

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
game is still in early stage and you

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.450 
game is still in early stage and you
