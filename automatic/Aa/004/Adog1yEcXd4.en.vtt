00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.039 
you can't get a sense of it I think it
may<00:01:41.880> just<00:01:41.909> be<00:01:42.090> more<00:01:42.299> scripted<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.840> press

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
may just be more scripted you press

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.420 
may just be more scripted you press
maybe<00:01:43.350> press<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.649> button<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.040> just<00:01:44.280> gotta

AI<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:09.690> interesting<00:02:10.379> it<00:02:10.470> seems<00:02:10.590> like<00:02:11.190> she

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
AI is interesting it seems like she

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.570 
AI is interesting it seems like she
tends<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.330> hide<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:12.980> will<00:02:13.980> only<00:02:14.220> come<00:02:14.550> out

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
tends to hide and will only come out

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.030 
tends to hide and will only come out
when<00:02:15.390> it's<00:02:15.450> perfectly<00:02:16.230> safe<00:02:16.500> for<00:02:16.560> her<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.860> come

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
when it's perfectly safe for her to come

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.910 
when it's perfectly safe for her to come
out<00:02:17.250> or<00:02:17.519> when<00:02:18.239> you're<00:02:18.450> in<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:19.230> most<00:02:19.590> danger

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
out or when you're in the most danger

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.280 
out or when you're in the most danger
yeah<00:02:20.489> it<00:02:20.640> didn't<00:02:20.880> seem<00:02:21.090> scripted<00:02:21.840> I<00:02:21.959> guess<00:02:22.140> I

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
yeah it didn't seem scripted I guess I

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.809 
yeah it didn't seem scripted I guess I
guess<00:02:22.440> it<00:02:22.590> is<00:02:22.709> dependent<00:02:23.220> on<00:02:23.250> West<00:02:23.459> was<00:02:23.760> won

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
guess it is dependent on West was won

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.729 
guess it is dependent on West was won
over<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.209> action<00:02:24.599> so<00:02:24.810> yeah<00:02:25.170> I<00:02:25.200> do<00:02:25.380> like<00:02:25.590> that

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
over the action so yeah I do like that

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.170 
over the action so yeah I do like that
aspect<00:02:25.980> of<00:02:26.220> I<00:02:26.310> like<00:02:26.459> that<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:26.849> know<00:02:26.879> and

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
aspect of I like that you know and

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.900 
aspect of I like that you know and
uncharted<00:02:27.540> had<00:02:27.780> some<00:02:27.930> great<00:02:28.110> AI<00:02:28.910> companions

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
uncharted had some great AI companions

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.430 
uncharted had some great AI companions
as<00:02:30.030> well<00:02:30.269> but<00:02:30.720> this<00:02:30.810> looks<00:02:30.989> like<00:02:31.110> a<00:02:31.170> very

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
as well but this looks like a very

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.900 
as well but this looks like a very
different<00:02:31.709> thing<00:02:31.739> because<00:02:32.040> obviously<00:02:32.280> she

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
different thing because obviously she

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.330 
different thing because obviously she
cannot<00:02:33.420> help<00:02:33.690> you<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.989> way<00:02:34.019> Sully<00:02:34.920> can<00:02:35.160> help

and<00:03:02.430> once<00:03:03.120> again<00:03:03.269> I<00:03:03.450> think<00:03:03.810> this<00:03:03.930> is<00:03:03.989> this<00:03:04.290> kind

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
and once again I think this is this kind

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.680 
and once again I think this is this kind
of<00:03:04.859> grounding<00:03:05.670> of<00:03:05.819> it<00:03:05.940> I<00:03:06.030> mean<00:03:06.209> we<00:03:06.329> know<00:03:06.510> this

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
of grounding of it I mean we know this

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.229 
of grounding of it I mean we know this
is<00:03:06.870> kind<00:03:07.079> of<00:03:07.139> a<00:03:07.230> zombie<00:03:07.829> story<00:03:08.160> but<00:03:08.910> it<00:03:09.000> feels

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
is kind of a zombie story but it feels

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.360 
is kind of a zombie story but it feels
very<00:03:09.450> real<00:03:09.959> and<00:03:10.319> when<00:03:10.500> you<00:03:10.590> shoot<00:03:10.829> that<00:03:10.859> guy<00:03:11.220> in

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
very real and when you shoot that guy in

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.430 
very real and when you shoot that guy in
the<00:03:11.459> face<00:03:11.639> and<00:03:11.850> you're<00:03:11.970> looking<00:03:12.150> at<00:03:12.450> it<00:03:12.630> you

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
the face and you're looking at it you

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.930 
the face and you're looking at it you
kind<00:03:13.889> of<00:03:14.010> feel<00:03:14.160> bad<00:03:14.370> for<00:03:14.430> what<00:03:14.700> you<00:03:14.850> just

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
kind of feel bad for what you just

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.400 
kind of feel bad for what you just
