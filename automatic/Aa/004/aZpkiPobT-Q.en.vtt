00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.649
 hello everyone in today's video os 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.839
 I bring this manicure super fun and 

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:08.519
 summertime that is super easy to do 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.339
 how are you going to be able to try next 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.730
 so nothing without more I leave you with the 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:13.730
 tutorial 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.199
 to begin we will paint our fingers 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.789
 turquoise thumb and little finger and 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.669
 when this painting is very dry 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.489
 we will pass over a layer of paint 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:35.720
 the same color but with neon purpurine 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.720
 of many colorines 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.140
 the fact of lula is going to be where will it go 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.090
 our big pineapple so we'll start 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.250
 painting it with two layers of paint 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.290
 yellow and let dry well 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.809
 continuation with brown paint and a 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.940
 finite brush we will draw lines in 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:03.340
 diagonal sense and then in the 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.340
 another sense to form diamonds 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.530
 we will correct any possible 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.540
 flaw with a little paint 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.910
 yellow acrylic and we will have 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.560
 superbly good then with 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.780
 the same brush and brown paint 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.360
 we will draw a small dot inside 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.670
 each rhombus and to finish we will draw 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.650
 the leaves on the top with 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.750
 green paint to give it a touch 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.180
 even more special we can add a 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.080
 little bit of green something darker to give 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.080
 depth to the leaves 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.010
 on our middle finger what are we going to 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.810
 to do will be to paint arias pineapples 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.510
 little girls and the first thing we will have 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.160
 what to do will be to paint with two layers of 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.140
 white paint our nail and a 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.870
 then with a finite brush and 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:10.539
 yellow paint we will draw species of 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.539
 oval to simulate the shape of the pineapples 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.750
 when the organs are dry 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.970
 we will draw the crosses as in the 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.310
 ring finger to simulate the texture of 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.500
 the pineapple and to finish the only thing that 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.340
 we have to do is put little leaves 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.340
 each of them 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.290
 and an 8 index finger to give that touch 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.910
 special we will paint it with two layers of 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.910
 gold glitter enamel 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.970
 to finish our design that this one 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.370
 last longer the only thing we have to 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.769
 to do is to pass over a layer of 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.640
 transparent glaze that will also make 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.640
 shine much more 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.720
 and nothing more here today's video 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.160
