00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
trapezius deltoid pectoralis major I'm

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.429 
trapezius deltoid pectoralis major I'm
yeah<00:01:24.229> pectoralis<00:01:24.679> major<00:01:25.479> this<00:01:26.479> right<00:01:26.750> here<00:01:27.200> is

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
yeah pectoralis major this right here is

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:32.109 
yeah pectoralis major this right here is
the<00:01:27.649> diaphragm<00:01:30.369> this<00:01:31.369> muscle<00:01:31.819> under<00:01:32.090> the

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
the diaphragm this muscle under the

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.410 
the diaphragm this muscle under the
lungs<00:01:32.450> and<00:01:32.990> this<00:01:33.649> blue<00:01:34.039> stuff<00:01:34.880> between<00:01:35.179> the

ribs is supposed to be your internal

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.309 
ribs is supposed to be your internal
intercostals<00:01:40.060> that<00:01:41.060> deep<00:01:41.359> layer<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.869> abdomen

00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:42.319 
intercostals that deep layer the abdomen

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:43.749 
intercostals that deep layer the abdomen
that<00:01:42.409> I<00:01:42.469> was<00:01:42.649> talking<00:01:43.069> about<00:01:43.130> you<00:01:43.520> can<00:01:43.729> see

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
that I was talking about you can see

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.240 
that I was talking about you can see
here<00:01:44.390> this<00:01:44.539> is<00:01:44.599> the<00:01:44.869> transverse<00:01:45.349> abdominis

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
here this is the transverse abdominis

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.809 
here this is the transverse abdominis
going<00:01:46.670> across<00:01:47.079> the<00:01:48.079> abdomen<00:01:48.819> transversely

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:49.819 
going across the abdomen transversely

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:52.510 
going across the abdomen transversely
you<00:01:50.239> can<00:01:50.390> look<00:01:50.659> at<00:01:50.959> the<00:01:51.140> fiber<00:01:51.500> direction<00:01:51.829> and

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
you can look at the fiber direction and

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.240 
you can look at the fiber direction and
see<00:01:53.270> which<00:01:53.450> muscles<00:01:53.929> those<00:01:54.140> are<00:01:54.409> you<00:01:55.069> don't

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
see which muscles those are you don't

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.580 
see which muscles those are you don't
have<00:01:55.369> to<00:01:55.489> make<00:01:55.640> these<00:01:55.759> muscles<00:01:56.179> in<00:01:56.270> here<00:01:56.590> all

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
have to make these muscles in here all

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.160 
have to make these muscles in here all
right<00:01:57.829> here<00:01:58.099> we're<00:01:58.250> just<00:01:58.280> looking<00:01:58.670> at<00:01:58.789> another

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
right here we're just looking at another

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.800 
right here we're just looking at another
anterior<00:02:00.170> chest<00:02:00.439> wall<00:02:00.890> with<00:02:01.219> the<00:02:01.340> abdomen<00:02:01.939> we

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
anterior chest wall with the abdomen we

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.880 
anterior chest wall with the abdomen we
can<00:02:03.110> see<00:02:03.439> our<00:02:04.719> transversus<00:02:05.719> abdominus<00:02:06.469> going

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
can see our transversus abdominus going

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.460 
can see our transversus abdominus going
across<00:02:07.269> remember<00:02:08.269> these<00:02:08.479> are<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.720> deep<00:02:09.049> layer

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
across remember these are the deep layer

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.360 
across remember these are the deep layer
of<00:02:09.950> those<00:02:10.819> abdominal<00:02:11.349> muscles<00:02:12.349> we<00:02:13.160> have

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
of those abdominal muscles we have

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.910 
of those abdominal muscles we have
fibers<00:02:13.849> going<00:02:14.420> up<00:02:14.629> and<00:02:14.870> down<00:02:15.079> which<00:02:15.650> is<00:02:15.890> the

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
fibers going up and down which is the

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.390 
fibers going up and down which is the
diaphragm<00:02:16.599> we<00:02:17.599> have<00:02:17.920> internal<00:02:18.920> intercostals

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
diaphragm we have internal intercostals

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.819 
diaphragm we have internal intercostals
we're<00:02:20.030> on<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.329> inside<00:02:20.569> of<00:02:21.139> the<00:02:21.200> body<00:02:21.440> between

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:21.829 
we're on the inside of the body between

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:24.339 
we're on the inside of the body between
the<00:02:22.069> ribs<00:02:22.599> this<00:02:23.599> is<00:02:23.840> actually<00:02:24.230> your

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
the ribs this is actually your

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.759 
the ribs this is actually your
sternocleidomastoid<00:02:25.269> here<00:02:26.269> you<00:02:27.200> do<00:02:27.410> not<00:02:27.560> have

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
sternocleidomastoid here you do not have

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.289 
sternocleidomastoid here you do not have
to<00:02:27.920> know<00:02:28.069> this<00:02:28.310> muscle<00:02:28.669> this<00:02:28.790> is<00:02:28.849> not

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
to know this muscle this is not

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.500
