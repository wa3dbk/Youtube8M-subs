alright guys here's a good way to get

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.529 
alright guys here's a good way to get
water<00:00:18.300> boiling<00:00:18.660> up<00:00:18.900> quick<00:00:19.170> in<00:00:20.039> your<00:00:20.189> fire<00:00:20.539> you

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
water boiling up quick in your fire you

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:22.849 
water boiling up quick in your fire you
need<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.810> get<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.080> fire<00:00:22.289> going<00:00:22.320> all<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.830> way

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
need to get the fire going all the way

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.839 
need to get the fire going all the way
around<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.430> that<00:00:24.980> way<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.039> got<00:00:26.220> all<00:00:26.369> surface

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
around it that way you got all surface

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.000 
around it that way you got all surface
areas<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.420> know<00:00:27.539> covered<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.170> actually<00:00:28.650> have

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
areas you know covered I actually have

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.440 
areas you know covered I actually have
this<00:00:29.189> bottle<00:00:29.580> setting<00:00:30.060> on<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:31.099> little

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
this bottle setting on a little

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.780 
this bottle setting on a little
Pathfinder<00:00:33.450> pack<00:00:33.660> stove<00:00:34.969> top<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:37.670> see<00:00:38.670> how

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
Pathfinder pack stove top and see how

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.209 
Pathfinder pack stove top and see how
quick<00:00:39.059> this<00:00:39.270> thing<00:00:39.480> goes<00:00:39.750> it's<00:00:40.739> only<00:00:40.950> had<00:00:41.129> it

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
quick this thing goes it's only had it

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.920 
quick this thing goes it's only had it
on<00:00:41.309> there<00:00:41.579> for<00:00:41.760> maybe<00:00:41.940> all<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.210> minute<00:00:42.629> or<00:00:42.719> so

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
on there for maybe all a minute or so

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.410 
on there for maybe all a minute or so
and<00:00:43.520> I'm<00:00:44.520> already<00:00:44.730> seeing<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.059> little<00:00:45.180> bit<00:00:45.270> of

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
and I'm already seeing a little bit of

00:00:45.420 --> 00:01:15.990 
and I'm already seeing a little bit of
bubble<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.899> it

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.810 

I<00:01:16.120> think<00:01:16.780> the<00:01:16.840> trick<00:01:17.110> is<00:01:17.260> getting<00:01:17.440> a<00:01:17.820> airflow

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
I think the trick is getting a airflow

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.600 
I think the trick is getting a airflow
underneath<00:01:19.000> it<00:01:19.950> that's<00:01:20.950> where<00:01:21.160> actually<00:01:21.400> the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
underneath it that's where actually the

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.950 
underneath it that's where actually the
bottom<00:01:21.790> can<00:01:22.180> get<00:01:22.950> caught<00:01:23.950> up<00:01:24.130> to<00:01:24.690> getting<00:01:25.690> some

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
bottom can get caught up to getting some

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.130 
bottom can get caught up to getting some
twigs<00:01:26.590> up<00:01:26.830> around<00:01:27.100> it<00:01:27.660> where<00:01:28.660> you're<00:01:28.870> getting

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
twigs up around it where you're getting

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.650 
twigs up around it where you're getting
all<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.740> area<00:01:30.040> around<00:01:30.250> the<00:01:30.460> bottle<00:01:30.790> heat<00:01:31.570> it

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
all the area around the bottle heat it

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:38.660 
all the area around the bottle heat it
up<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:36.220> winds<00:01:36.700> actually<00:01:37.150> helping<00:01:37.840> right<00:01:38.050> now

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
up the winds actually helping right now

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.010 
up the winds actually helping right now
kind<00:01:39.670> of<00:01:39.700> creating<00:01:40.150> like<00:01:40.240> a<00:01:40.270> blowtorch<00:01:40.750> effect

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
kind of creating like a blowtorch effect

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.640 
kind of creating like a blowtorch effect
on<00:01:41.470> it<00:01:42.660> we'll<00:01:43.660> try<00:01:43.840> to<00:01:43.900> zoom<00:01:44.110> in<00:01:44.380> here<00:01:44.410> a<00:01:44.560> little

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
on it we'll try to zoom in here a little

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.320 
on it we'll try to zoom in here a little
bit<00:01:44.830> you<00:01:44.950> can<00:01:45.190> see<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.430> bubbles<00:01:45.790> forming<00:01:46.180> up

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
bit you can see the bubbles forming up

00:01:46.330 --> 00:02:00.590 
bit you can see the bubbles forming up
at<00:01:46.450> the<00:01:46.510> top

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.220 

not<00:02:01.170> quite<00:02:01.440> a<00:02:01.470> boil<00:02:01.860> yet<00:02:02.750> let<00:02:03.750> go<00:02:03.930> just<00:02:04.170> a

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.230 
not quite a boil yet let go just a

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.230 
not quite a boil yet let go just a
little<00:02:04.380> bit<00:02:04.500> longer<00:02:07.820> it's<00:02:08.820> a<00:02:08.850> pretty<00:02:09.060> good

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
little bit longer it's a pretty good

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.070 
little bit longer it's a pretty good
test<00:02:09.540> for<00:02:09.780> these<00:02:10.110> bottles<00:02:10.920> here<00:02:11.130> too<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:12.300> see

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
test for these bottles here too to see

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.920 
test for these bottles here too to see
if<00:02:13.170> they'll<00:02:13.320> withstand<00:02:13.530> this<00:02:14.040> type<00:02:14.250> of<00:02:14.280> heat

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
if they'll withstand this type of heat

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:38.680 
if they'll withstand this type of heat
like<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:16.160> guy<00:02:17.160> who<00:02:17.220> bottle<00:02:17.760> will<00:02:17.850> do

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.780 

just<00:02:39.260> waiting<00:02:39.590> for<00:02:39.620> a<00:02:39.770> good<00:02:39.830> rolling<00:02:40.340> boil

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
just waiting for a good rolling boil

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.090 
just waiting for a good rolling boil
there<00:02:41.240> make<00:02:41.690> sure<00:02:41.870> that<00:02:41.990> water<00:02:42.200> is<00:02:42.440> good<00:02:42.740> and

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
there make sure that water is good and

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:50.800 
there make sure that water is good and
purified<00:02:46.030> and<00:02:47.030> it's<00:02:47.390> pretty<00:02:47.780> much<00:02:49.480> there<00:02:50.480> now

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
purified and it's pretty much there now

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.200 
purified and it's pretty much there now
that's<00:02:51.170> about<00:02:51.320> Oh<00:02:52.660> three<00:02:53.660> or<00:02:53.690> four<00:02:53.930> minutes

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210 
that's about Oh three or four minutes

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.490 
that's about Oh three or four minutes
like<00:02:56.210> that<00:02:56.240> I<00:02:56.480> already<00:02:56.780> had<00:02:56.990> a<00:02:57.020> good<00:02:57.200> bed<00:02:57.380> of

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
like that I already had a good bed of

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.160 
like that I already had a good bed of
coals<00:02:57.650> down<00:02:58.100> there<00:02:58.370> and<00:03:01.630> just<00:03:02.630> built<00:03:02.870> the<00:03:02.990> fire

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
coals down there and just built the fire

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.130 
coals down there and just built the fire
up<00:03:03.410> around<00:03:03.680> it<00:03:03.980> and<00:03:04.420> have<00:03:05.420> it<00:03:05.540> on<00:03:05.630> top<00:03:05.870> of<00:03:05.900> one

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
up around it and have it on top of one

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.440 
up around it and have it on top of one
of<00:03:06.200> those<00:03:06.290> Pathfinder<00:03:07.010> stoves<00:03:07.310> all<00:03:08.300> right

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
of those Pathfinder stoves all right

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.600 
of those Pathfinder stoves all right
guys<00:03:08.690> that's<00:03:09.290> a<00:03:09.560> pretty<00:03:09.920> good<00:03:10.100> test<00:03:10.310> for<00:03:10.430> this

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
guys that's a pretty good test for this

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.490 
guys that's a pretty good test for this
bottle<00:03:11.000> we'll<00:03:11.540> take<00:03:11.750> it<00:03:11.870> off<00:03:11.990> here<00:03:12.290> and<00:03:12.380> let<00:03:12.470> it

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
bottle we'll take it off here and let it

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.530 
bottle we'll take it off here and let it
cool<00:03:12.740> down<00:03:12.800> and<00:03:13.370> see<00:03:14.270> how<00:03:14.420> it's<00:03:14.570> holding<00:03:14.810> up

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
cool down and see how it's holding up

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.790 
cool down and see how it's holding up
well<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:17.660> bottles<00:03:18.020> holding<00:03:18.350> up<00:03:18.470> pretty<00:03:18.710> good

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
well the bottles holding up pretty good

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.600 
well the bottles holding up pretty good
this<00:03:19.760> is<00:03:19.910> the<00:03:20.060> fourth<00:03:20.420> boil<00:03:21.010> on<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.070> bottle

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
this is the fourth boil on the bottle

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.580 
this is the fourth boil on the bottle
I've<00:03:22.940> had<00:03:23.150> some<00:03:23.360> pretty<00:03:23.660> high<00:03:23.960> heat<00:03:24.260> on<00:03:24.440> this

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
I've had some pretty high heat on this

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.780 
I've had some pretty high heat on this
thing<00:03:24.890> and<00:03:26.710> so<00:03:27.710> far<00:03:27.950> it's<00:03:28.130> holding<00:03:28.400> up<00:03:28.550> pretty

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
thing and so far it's holding up pretty

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.380 
thing and so far it's holding up pretty
decent<00:03:29.710> I'll<00:03:30.710> kind<00:03:31.040> of<00:03:31.100> like<00:03:31.250> the<00:03:31.490> the<00:03:31.520> design

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
decent I'll kind of like the the design

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.620 
decent I'll kind of like the the design
it's<00:03:32.750> a<00:03:32.840> little<00:03:33.050> small<00:03:33.380> for<00:03:33.680> bushcrafting<00:03:34.430> a

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
it's a little small for bushcrafting a

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.840 
it's a little small for bushcrafting a
little<00:03:35.630> bit<00:03:35.750> thin-walled<00:03:36.290> for<00:03:37.220> you<00:03:37.760> know

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
little bit thin-walled for you know

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.370 
little bit thin-walled for you know
doing<00:03:38.150> a<00:03:38.210> lot<00:03:38.360> of<00:03:38.450> things<00:03:38.630> it's<00:03:38.840> not<00:03:39.020> going<00:03:39.320> to
