people<00:01:10.929> find<00:01:11.200> that<00:01:11.380> it's<00:01:11.830> easier<00:01:12.340> to<00:01:12.490> do

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
people find that it's easier to do

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.999 
people find that it's easier to do
something<00:01:13.000> from<00:01:13.119> one<00:01:13.330> hand<00:01:13.570> then<00:01:14.320> the<00:01:14.800> other

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
something from one hand then the other

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.550 
something from one hand then the other
but<00:01:15.940> here's<00:01:16.270> something<00:01:16.660> important<00:01:17.200> to<00:01:17.350> keep

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
but here's something important to keep

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.190 
but here's something important to keep
in<00:01:17.679> mind<00:01:17.850> if<00:01:18.850> you<00:01:19.149> can<00:01:19.330> learn<00:01:19.450> to<00:01:19.600> do<00:01:19.720> something

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
in mind if you can learn to do something

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.320 
in mind if you can learn to do something
from<00:01:20.530> your<00:01:20.679> right<00:01:21.070> hand<00:01:21.310> and<00:01:21.550> you<00:01:22.030> can<00:01:22.210> learn

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
from your right hand and you can learn

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.669 
from your right hand and you can learn
to<00:01:22.479> do<00:01:22.570> it<00:01:22.600> from<00:01:22.840> your<00:01:23.050> left<00:01:23.289> hand

00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:23.679 
to do it from your left hand

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:26.160 
to do it from your left hand
I<00:01:24.240> find<00:01:25.240> that<00:01:25.330> whichever<00:01:25.570> hand<00:01:25.840> you<00:01:25.960> learn

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
I find that whichever hand you learn

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.309 
I find that whichever hand you learn
with<00:01:26.289> first<00:01:26.740> usually<00:01:27.399> feels<00:01:27.970> easier<00:01:28.539> that's

00:01:29.309 --> 00:01:29.319 
with first usually feels easier that's

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:31.499 
with first usually feels easier that's
why<00:01:29.500> I<00:01:29.530> like<00:01:29.740> to<00:01:29.830> teach<00:01:30.009> people<00:01:30.190> to<00:01:30.460> start<00:01:30.880> with

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
why I like to teach people to start with

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.889 
why I like to teach people to start with
their<00:01:31.750> off<00:01:31.960> hand<00:01:32.380> first<00:01:32.770> after<00:01:33.700> all<00:01:33.880> now<00:01:34.689> that

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
their off hand first after all now that

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:36.960 
their off hand first after all now that
you<00:01:34.990> can<00:01:35.140> do<00:01:35.259> step<00:01:35.500> two<00:01:35.680> using<00:01:36.189> your<00:01:36.369> worse

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
you can do step two using your worse

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.569 
you can do step two using your worse
hand<00:01:37.360> first<00:01:37.799> learning<00:01:38.799> to<00:01:38.950> do<00:01:39.040> with<00:01:39.189> your<00:01:39.340> good

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 
hand first learning to do with your good

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:42.960 
hand first learning to do with your good
hand<00:01:39.850> should<00:01:40.270> be<00:01:40.299> no<00:01:40.659> problem<00:01:41.079> at<00:01:41.200> all<00:01:41.970> still

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
hand should be no problem at all still

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.510 
hand should be no problem at all still
it<00:01:43.210> feels<00:01:43.630> funny<00:01:43.990> doing<00:01:44.229> it<00:01:44.469> the<00:01:44.710> opposite<00:01:45.310> way

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520

morning before you try again I know that
when<00:03:35.640> I'm<00:03:35.790> working<00:03:36.209> on<00:03:36.269> a<00:03:36.330> new<00:03:36.810> trick

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
when I'm working on a new trick

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.539 
when I'm working on a new trick
particularly<00:03:37.920> if<00:03:38.069> it's<00:03:38.220> one<00:03:38.400> that's

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
particularly if it's one that's

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.880 
particularly if it's one that's
challenging<00:03:39.030> me<00:03:39.209> I<00:03:39.420> find<00:03:40.290> that<00:03:40.380> if<00:03:40.500> I<00:03:40.590> come

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
challenging me I find that if I come

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.530 
challenging me I find that if I come
back<00:03:41.010> to<00:03:41.220> it<00:03:41.310> in<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.489> morning<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:42.329> trick

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
back to it in the morning the trick

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.410 
back to it in the morning the trick
suddenly<00:03:42.959> feels<00:03:43.109> a<00:03:43.260> lot<00:03:43.680> easier<00:03:44.400> that's<00:03:45.239> the

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
suddenly feels a lot easier that's the

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.390 
suddenly feels a lot easier that's the
way<00:03:45.510> our<00:03:45.570> bodies<00:03:45.900> work<00:03:46.140> our<00:03:46.620> brains<00:03:46.950> tend<00:03:47.310> to

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
way our bodies work our brains tend to

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.979 
way our bodies work our brains tend to
process<00:03:48.060> new<00:03:48.090> skills<00:03:48.660> that<00:03:48.750> we've<00:03:48.959> learned

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
process new skills that we've learned

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.220 
process new skills that we've learned
while<00:03:49.890> we're<00:03:50.130> sleeping<00:03:50.540> so<00:03:51.540> if<00:03:51.810> you<00:03:51.959> haven't

while we're sleeping so if you haven't

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.170 
while we're sleeping so if you haven't
taken<00:03:52.290> a<00:03:52.470> break<00:03:52.590> yet<00:03:52.859> maybe<00:03:53.549> now's<00:03:53.760> the<00:03:53.940> time

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
taken a break yet maybe now's the time

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.090 
taken a break yet maybe now's the time
just<00:03:54.840> promise<00:03:55.140> yourself<00:03:55.230> that<00:03:55.560> you<00:03:55.650> will<00:03:55.859> come

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
just promise yourself that you will come

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.640 
just promise yourself that you will come
back<00:03:56.130> to<00:03:56.280> this<00:03:56.549> a<00:03:56.880> little<00:03:57.150> later<00:03:57.359> on<00:03:57.660> I'll<00:03:58.350> see

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650
