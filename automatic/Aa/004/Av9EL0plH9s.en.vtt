00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.480
 Hello, today we will make you a flower 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.940
 from tape 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.970
 I will combine two colors but if 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.830
 you want can do and monotonous i 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.740
 I take a tape two and a half wide 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.500
 centimeter and cut off by 4 centimeters in 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.279
 I can cut the length of 4 by 2 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.070
 and a half 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:33.180
 further from these ribbons I cut here 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.180
 such a petal 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:54.170
 now leave the petal lighter and 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.170
 wavy edge of petal 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:22.450
 if you are comfortable you can process 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:26.160
 this petal and above the candle is melted 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.160
 edge and tuck 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.270
 that's what we get in this way 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.540
 we process all the petals and since i 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.660
 I make two colored flower I take two 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.290
 petals of different colors and impose one 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.620
 another 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.400
 further tuck up dark pink 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:52.300
 petal 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:56.080
 like this and drop down light pink 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:02:04.700
 I get this detail here 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:06.950
 I fix the lower cut with a cigarette lighter 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.380
 see the petal is two-sided 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.530
 one side is light pink the other 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.480
 the side is bright pink and when i will 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.810
 stick these petals on the base I 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:25.160
 I will glue all the petals equally 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:27.800
 light pink top of the basics cut out 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.080
 Felt with a diameter of 4 and a half centimeters 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.190
 Thermal glue glue the petals to each 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.190
 near a friend in a circle 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.600
 I went to the first row of 14 petal 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.880
 the next row we will glue between 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.430
 petals of the first row dropping down 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.630
 a few millimeters we get 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.630
 also 14 petals 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.890
 Now we repeat the process 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.050
 glue the third row next to each other 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.740
 the fourth row between the petals of the third 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.740
 row 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.880
 on the third row I stuck at eight 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.090
 petals and 4 and also stick 8 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.090
 petals 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.850
 here is my flower you can 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:21.430
 glue the middle and leave it as 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:24.310
 flower but i decided to make it like 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:31.470
 a bow so we will make the middle of 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:43.830
 same petals glue petals 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:43.830
 2 together and now in a circle pasted over 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.590
 I stuck 6 petals in the middle 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.530
 now due to the fact that in the center of the flower 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.600
 we have very little space left i can't 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:39.880
 stick too many petals to 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:44.590
 the middle, therefore, 6 petals I thought her 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:47.310
 enough i will cut the bottom of the same here 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.310
 so diagonally 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:57.070
 so in the rut 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:59.230
 center of the flower next I'm just so lazy 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:01.710
 petals separately where there will be them 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.710
 grab 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.280
 and glue 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:24.600
 So 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:28.770
 and now here are some of my places needed 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:31.050
 already glue the petals separate here 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:34.440
 I have four petals left I think 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:38.699
 they need to be made a little shorter than that 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:42.590
 the very bottom they no longer delivered I 

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:42.590
 cut about five millimeters 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.480
 now glue here 

00:07:26.929 --> 00:07:32.579
 generally dokleivaem pitch adding 

00:07:30.299 --> 00:07:39.539
 see where you think they are 

00:07:32.579 --> 00:07:41.899
 not enough so that we have a magnificent 

00:07:39.539 --> 00:07:41.899
 bow 

00:07:49.689 --> 00:07:53.979
 that's all our bow is ready now you 

00:07:51.849 --> 00:07:55.059
 can attach it to a hairpin or to 

00:07:53.979 --> 00:07:57.159
 hair tie 

00:07:55.059 --> 00:07:59.289
 she today all do not forget to put 

00:07:57.159 --> 00:08:03.329
 class if you liked this video 

00:07:59.289 --> 00:08:03.329
 work with pleasure for all 

00:08:09.569 --> 00:08:12.319
 but
