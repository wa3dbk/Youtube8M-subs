00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
hardware and the motives to me aren't

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.720 
hardware and the motives to me aren't
legitimate<00:00:50.690> and<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.870> course<00:00:52.079> they<00:00:52.260> they<00:00:53.129> brand

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
legitimate and of course they they brand

legitimate and of course they they brand
it<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.940> lot<00:00:54.149> different<00:00:54.390> ways<00:00:54.480> but<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:55.050> shift

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
it a lot different ways but this shift

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.150 
it a lot different ways but this shift

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
it when you're going to consider to buy

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.789 
it when you're going to consider to buy
a<00:01:05.729> new<00:01:05.970> one<00:01:06.119> they<00:01:06.869> have<00:01:07.140> changed<00:01:07.409> their

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
a new one they have changed their

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.500 
a new one they have changed their
standard<00:01:08.450> charger<00:01:09.450> which<00:01:10.909> which<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:12.150> mean

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
standard charger which which I mean

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.300 
standard charger which which I mean
they're<00:01:12.840> there<00:01:13.170> reason<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.830> rationale

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
they're there reason the rationale

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.609 
they're there reason the rationale
behind<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:15.030> course<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:16.409> one's

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
behind it is of course that this one's

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.170 
behind it is of course that this one's
gonna<00:01:16.710> be<00:01:16.770> more<00:01:16.920> reliable<00:01:17.280> this<00:01:17.850> one's<00:01:18.030> going

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
gonna be more reliable this one's going

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.359 
gonna be more reliable this one's going
to<00:01:18.240> be<00:01:18.390> better<00:01:19.049> for<00:01:19.259> docking<00:01:19.740> connectivity

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
to be better for docking connectivity

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.710 
to be better for docking connectivity
this<00:01:20.490> one's<00:01:20.700> good<00:01:20.850> at<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.150> one<00:01:21.330> was<00:01:21.479> there<00:01:21.509> so

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
this one's good at this one was there so

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.050 
this one's good at this one was there so
that<00:01:21.930> they<00:01:22.110> could<00:01:22.320> properly<00:01:23.009> resize<00:01:23.700> the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
that they could properly resize the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.370 
that they could properly resize the
phone<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.390> make<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.659> thinner<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:25.110> mean<00:01:25.259> they

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
phone to make it thinner I mean they

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.749 
phone to make it thinner I mean they
came<00:01:25.770> up<00:01:25.799> with<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.040> million<00:01:26.460> different<00:01:26.549> reasons

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
came up with a million different reasons

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.999 
came up with a million different reasons
why<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.750> was<00:01:27.900> essential<00:01:28.380> for<00:01:28.439> them<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.710> move<00:01:28.829> to

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
why it was essential for them to move to

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.980 
why it was essential for them to move to
this<00:01:29.130> new<00:01:29.310> charger<00:01:29.729> type<00:01:29.939> but<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.689> think

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
this new charger type but I think

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.510 
this new charger type but I think
ultimately<00:01:31.110> that's<00:01:31.740> going<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.070> be<00:01:32.159> one<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.430> the

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
ultimately that's going to be one of the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.160 
ultimately that's going to be one of the

hardware and an accessory is built up I

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.530 
hardware and an accessory is built up I
mean<00:01:56.040> even<00:01:56.070> cars<00:01:56.610> were<00:01:56.909> built<00:01:57.060> with<00:01:57.240> docks

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
mean even cars were built with docks

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.179 
mean even cars were built with docks
with<00:01:57.990> this<00:01:58.170> connector<00:01:58.619> on<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:58.950> mean<00:01:59.040> that's

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
with this connector on it I mean that's

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.480 
with this connector on it I mean that's
how<00:01:59.369> standard<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.119> had<00:02:00.240> become<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:01.130> there's<00:02:02.130> so

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
how standard it had become so there's so

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.389 
how standard it had become so there's so
many<00:02:03.439> thousands<00:02:04.439> hundreds<00:02:04.860> of<00:02:04.920> thousands<00:02:05.310> of

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399

accessories out there that people either
already<00:02:07.200> own<00:02:07.500> or<00:02:07.950> if<00:02:08.700> they<00:02:08.819> can<00:02:09.000> think<00:02:09.179> about

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
already own or if they can think about

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.710 
already own or if they can think about
it<00:02:09.629> there's<00:02:09.810> an<00:02:09.929> accessory<00:02:10.349> that<00:02:10.379> can<00:02:10.649> do<00:02:10.890> it

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
it there's an accessory that can do it

on<00:03:15.500> them<00:03:15.680> changing<00:03:16.100> the<00:03:16.190> charger<00:03:16.550> personally

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
on them changing the charger personally

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.180 
on them changing the charger personally
I<00:03:17.209> think<00:03:17.540> it's<00:03:17.900> kind<00:03:18.140> of<00:03:18.200> a<00:03:18.290> money<00:03:18.470> grab<00:03:18.739> and<00:03:19.040> I

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
I think it's kind of a money grab and I

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.440 
I think it's kind of a money grab and I
think<00:03:19.370> it's<00:03:19.459> going<00:03:19.550> to<00:03:19.640> bounce<00:03:19.790> back<00:03:20.090> to<00:03:20.300> hurt

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
think it's going to bounce back to hurt

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.240 
think it's going to bounce back to hurt
them<00:03:20.660> I<00:03:20.870> know<00:03:21.470> I've<00:03:21.650> already<00:03:21.769> talked<00:03:22.100> to<00:03:22.220> a
