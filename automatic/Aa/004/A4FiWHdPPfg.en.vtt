in the update of 0.7 point three this is

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.359 
in the update of 0.7 point three this is
in<00:00:24.430> my<00:00:24.610> opinion<00:00:24.700> one<00:00:25.119> of<00:00:25.180> the<00:00:25.300> biggest<00:00:26.369> minor

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:27.369 
in my opinion one of the biggest minor

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.150 
in my opinion one of the biggest minor
update<00:00:27.790> if<00:00:27.970> that<00:00:28.150> makes<00:00:28.300> any<00:00:28.360> sense<00:00:28.480> um<00:00:28.900> as<00:00:29.290> you

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
update if that makes any sense um as you

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.360 
update if that makes any sense um as you
can<00:00:30.250> see<00:00:30.430> we<00:00:30.610> have<00:00:30.760> the<00:00:30.790> Sun<00:00:31.240> now<00:00:31.480> it<00:00:32.410> is<00:00:33.310> a

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
can see we have the Sun now it is a

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.860 
can see we have the Sun now it is a
little<00:00:33.910> hard<00:00:34.120> to<00:00:34.239> see<00:00:34.360> through<00:00:34.540> the<00:00:34.630> clouds

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
little hard to see through the clouds

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.420 
little hard to see through the clouds
honestly<00:00:35.530> I<00:00:35.560> think<00:00:35.710> they<00:00:36.040> should<00:00:36.250> need<00:00:36.340> to

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
honestly I think they should need to

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.370 
honestly I think they should need to
make<00:00:36.579> them<00:00:36.730> 3d<00:00:37.120> which<00:00:37.360> is<00:00:37.540> coming<00:00:37.720> soon<00:00:37.840> or

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:38.380 
make them 3d which is coming soon or

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.470 
make them 3d which is coming soon or
more<00:00:39.220> transparent<00:00:39.880> they<00:00:40.000> are<00:00:40.180> slightly

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
more transparent they are slightly

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.410 
more transparent they are slightly
transparent<00:00:40.870> now<00:00:41.140> but<00:00:41.680> um<00:00:41.940> before<00:00:42.940> it<00:00:43.239> turns

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
transparent now but um before it turns

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609 
sound which is a bit annoying but I'd so

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:04.860 
sound which is a bit annoying but I'd so
awesome<00:01:03.910> added<00:01:04.150> that<00:01:04.269> so<00:01:04.449> that's<00:01:04.570> the<00:01:04.780> new

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 
awesome added that so that's the new

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.010 
awesome added that so that's the new
chest<00:01:05.430> animation<00:01:06.570> not<00:01:07.570> it's<00:01:07.720> not<00:01:07.810> really

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
chest animation not it's not really

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.590 
chest animation not it's not really
buggy<00:01:08.350> necessarily<00:01:08.920> um<00:01:09.340> the<00:01:09.850> chests<00:01:10.180> are<00:01:10.300> flat

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
buggy necessarily um the chests are flat

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.420 
buggy necessarily um the chests are flat
I<00:01:10.840> think<00:01:11.140> that's<00:01:11.230> a<00:01:11.380> slight<00:01:11.620> bug<00:01:11.860> like<00:01:12.220> let's

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
I think that's a slight bug like let's

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.120 
I think that's a slight bug like let's
see<00:01:12.610> we're<00:01:12.820> quick<00:01:12.940> if<00:01:13.060> you<00:01:13.180> spit<00:01:13.450> it<00:01:13.570> out<00:01:13.659> um<00:01:14.290> it

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
see we're quick if you spit it out um it

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.280 
see we're quick if you spit it out um it
is<00:01:15.310> a<00:01:15.340> flat<00:01:15.730> block<00:01:16.180> and<00:01:16.720> I<00:01:16.840> don't<00:01:17.020> think<00:01:17.170> that's

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
is a flat block and I don't think that's

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.230 
is a flat block and I don't think that's
how<00:01:17.380> it's<00:01:17.500> supposed<00:01:17.710> to<00:01:17.800> be<00:01:17.920> because<00:01:18.820> crafting

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
how it's supposed to be because crafting

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.730 
how it's supposed to be because crafting
tables<00:01:19.510> are<00:01:19.600> not<00:01:19.720> like<00:01:19.840> that<00:01:19.870> so<00:01:20.290> that<00:01:20.440> is<00:01:20.530> one

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
tables are not like that so that is one

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.240 
tables are not like that so that is one
of<00:01:20.860> the<00:01:20.890> known<00:01:21.160> bugs<00:01:21.490> am<00:01:21.840> as<00:01:22.840> well<00:01:23.230> as<00:01:23.590> I'll

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
of the known bugs am as well as I'll

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.640 
of the known bugs am as well as I'll
show<00:01:24.280> another<00:01:24.640> bug<00:01:24.880> later<00:01:25.150> but<00:01:25.570> another<00:01:26.470> thing

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
show another bug later but another thing

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.020 
show another bug later but another thing
that<00:01:26.800> people<00:01:27.040> think<00:01:27.190> is<00:01:27.400> a<00:01:27.430> bug<00:01:27.640> is<00:01:27.850> when

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
that people think is a bug is when

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.490 
that people think is a bug is when
you're<00:01:28.150> breaking<00:01:28.480> it<00:01:28.600> it<00:01:28.750> shakes<00:01:29.080> like<00:01:29.290> that

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
you're breaking it it shakes like that

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.410 
you're breaking it it shakes like that
but<00:01:30.160> it's<00:01:30.310> actually<00:01:30.490> meant<00:01:30.880> to<00:01:30.970> do<00:01:31.090> that<00:01:31.120> that

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
but it's actually meant to do that that

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.790 
but it's actually meant to do that that
is<00:01:31.510> just<00:01:31.540> a<00:01:31.750> feature<00:01:31.960> I<00:01:32.110> don't<00:01:32.470> know<00:01:32.560> why<00:01:32.770> but

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
is just a feature I don't know why but

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.850 
is just a feature I don't know why but
it's<00:01:33.550> not<00:01:33.670> a<00:01:33.700> bug<00:01:34.080> also<00:01:35.080> doubles<00:01:35.500> chests

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
it's not a bug also doubles chests

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.320 
it's not a bug also doubles chests
haven't<00:01:36.280> added<00:01:36.520> here's<00:01:36.730> the<00:01:36.910> normal

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330
