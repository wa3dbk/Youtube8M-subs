00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
it's like cloning is not is not really

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.340 
it's like cloning is not is not really
the<00:01:51.340> speed<00:01:51.700> notability<00:01:52.240> power<00:01:52.750> it<00:01:52.960> comes<00:01:53.110> on

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
the speed notability power it comes on

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.109 
the speed notability power it comes on
really<00:01:53.500> this<00:01:54.100> smoothness<00:01:54.670> and<00:01:54.790> this<00:01:54.940> is

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
really this smoothness and this is

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.820 
really this smoothness and this is
really<00:01:55.299> a<00:01:57.270> detuned<00:01:58.270> right<00:01:58.540> now<00:01:58.720> it's<00:01:59.049> 91<00:01:59.440> gas<00:01:59.799> I

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
really a detuned right now it's 91 gas I

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.609 
really a detuned right now it's 91 gas I
mean<00:02:00.399> and<00:02:00.909> this<00:02:01.750> was<00:02:01.990> basically<00:02:02.229> on<00:02:03.960> 8<00:02:04.960> psi

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
mean and this was basically on 8 psi

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.160 
mean and this was basically on 8 psi
right<00:02:05.920> now<00:02:06.100> so<00:02:06.789> I<00:02:06.820> can<00:02:07.000> imagine<00:02:07.149> 12<00:02:07.600> psi<00:02:07.899> and

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
right now so I can imagine 12 psi and

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.100 
right now so I can imagine 12 psi and
all<00:02:08.470> the<00:02:08.619> stuff<00:02:08.860> so<00:02:09.330> let's<00:02:10.330> make<00:02:10.479> a<00:02:10.509> u-turn<00:02:10.750> on

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110
