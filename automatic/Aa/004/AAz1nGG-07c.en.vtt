00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:15.929
 Voltaire on the palm is his dimensions 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:18.359
 Makarov's pistol analogue of Walter 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:23.570
 trigger gun must stand 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.570
 dead but this does not happen 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.550
 look carefully when pulling the trigger 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:38.129
 the gun bites down a little he pulls off 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:42.390
 take a closer look while descending the gun 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:46.350
 shifts a millimeter and a half from this 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:51.230
 when shooting at a distance of 25 meters bullet 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.230
 leaves in the direction of 20-25 centimeters 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:59.160
 you see a picking process 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.469
 pistol when fired from a cartridge and 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.939
 weapons here nothing depends everything 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:08.880
 depends on the arrow on the trigger 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:11.390
 when descending, a force of 23 kilograms 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.340
 which is balanced by effort 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.619
 holding the fingers of the other fingers 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.530
 the moment of the trigger these two three 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:26.820
 kilograms disappear and unbalance 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:31.310
 Forces the pistol crows the target more often 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.310
 total pistol held back right-left 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.780
 See how Murka goes in the pillars 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:01.030
 to neutralize pull off and I'm at 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:04.869
 shooting revolvers of all systems 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.869
 the drum is tightly clamped
