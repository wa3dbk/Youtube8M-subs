00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
just like this the first step is we fry

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:08.300 
just like this the first step is we fry
the<00:01:00.910> noodle<00:01:03.150> whip<00:01:04.150> up<00:01:04.390> any<00:01:05.220> kind<00:01:06.220> of<00:01:06.520> oil<00:01:07.180> or

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.580 

till<00:01:16.190> the<00:01:17.190> noodle<00:01:17.580> or<00:01:18.350> family<00:01:19.760> turns<00:01:20.760> to<00:01:21.210> be

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
till the noodle or family turns to be

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.420 
till the noodle or family turns to be
golden<00:01:22.590> brown<00:01:25.100> don't<00:01:26.100> forget<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:27.110> steer<00:01:28.110> them

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.130

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
since our noodle already turns to golden

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.810 
since our noodle already turns to golden
brown<00:01:43.700> then<00:01:44.700> after<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.710> we<00:01:46.710> pour<00:01:47.070> water<00:01:49.820> just

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.090 

milk<00:03:43.100> is<00:03:43.250> already<00:03:43.670> well<00:03:44.540> boiled<00:03:44.960> so<00:03:45.530> we<00:03:45.770> turn

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
milk is already well boiled so we turn

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:55.050 
milk is already well boiled so we turn
to<00:03:47.030> stuff

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:06.350 

and<00:03:55.150> we<00:03:56.140> pour<00:03:56.440> our<00:03:56.910> warm<00:03:57.910> milk<00:03:58.470> into<00:03:59.470> the<00:04:05.340> and

and we pour our warm milk into the and

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:14.880 
and we pour our warm milk into the and
we<00:04:07.360> cook<00:04:08.310> little<00:04:09.310> bit<00:04:10.709> for<00:04:11.709> some<00:04:11.860> times<00:04:13.890> so

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
we cook little bit for some times so

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:21.390 
we cook little bit for some times so
they<00:04:15.099> can<00:04:15.310> all<00:04:16.060> mix<00:04:16.450> together<00:04:18.150> and<00:04:19.919> also<00:04:20.919> we

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
they can all mix together and also we

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:28.110 
they can all mix together and also we
can<00:04:21.609> pour<00:04:22.110> condensed<00:04:23.110> milk<00:04:26.460> very<00:04:27.460> delicious

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120

and<00:04:28.360> yummy

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
and yummy

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:38.700 
and yummy
so<00:04:30.580> some<00:04:31.120> people<00:04:32.370> also<00:04:33.370> can<00:04:33.910> choose<00:04:35.040> sugar<00:04:37.710> but

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
so some people also can choose sugar but

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.640 
so some people also can choose sugar but
in<00:04:38.979> this<00:04:39.130> case<00:04:39.450> I'm<00:04:40.450> using<00:04:40.620> condensed<00:04:41.620> milk<00:04:42.389> so

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
in this case I'm using condensed milk so

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.120 
in this case I'm using condensed milk so
the<00:04:44.650> milk<00:04:44.889> flavor<00:04:45.490> is<00:04:46.000> more<00:04:46.510> rich<00:04:47.380> in<00:04:47.710> to<00:04:48.010> our

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
the milk flavor is more rich in to our

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:54.540 
the milk flavor is more rich in to our
dessert<00:04:51.780> since<00:04:52.780> all<00:04:53.080> ingredients<00:04:54.010> already

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
dessert since all ingredients already

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.250 
dessert since all ingredients already
well<00:04:54.820> mix<00:04:55.710> then<00:04:56.710> we<00:04:57.550> can<00:04:57.790> turn<00:04:58.120> off<00:04:58.300> our<00:04:58.510> stuff

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
well mix then we can turn off our stuff
