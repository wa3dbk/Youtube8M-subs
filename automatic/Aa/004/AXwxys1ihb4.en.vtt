00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
otherwise and and a lot of that goes to

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.360 
coach Malzahn where i got my foundation
i<00:00:46.079> think<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.469> other<00:00:46.590> thing<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.890> just<00:00:47.160> my

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
i think the other thing is just my

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.490 
i think the other thing is just my
experiences<00:00:48.000> when<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.329> when<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.020> played<00:00:49.350> the

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
experiences when you when you played the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.930 
experiences when you when you played the
position<00:00:49.620> i<00:00:50.039> think<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.399> really<00:00:50.520> helps<00:00:50.820> you

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
position i think it really helps you

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.580 
position i think it really helps you
coach<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.360> because<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:51.870> can<00:00:52.050> identify<00:00:52.199> with

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
coach it because I can identify with

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.709 
coach it because I can identify with
what<00:00:52.739> those<00:00:53.010> guys<00:00:53.190> are<00:00:53.250> going<00:00:53.610> through<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.570> I

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719
