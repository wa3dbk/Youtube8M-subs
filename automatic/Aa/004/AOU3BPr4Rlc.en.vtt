00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.169
 hi everyone its hinges and so has 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.259
 today come together for a 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.880
 new tutorial finally a new tutorial between 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.649
 others since I will resume a tutorial 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.739
 that I had done so my wrist tuto 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:37.720
 I had done on the field this shot but 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.220
 good most of my subscribers are not 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.629
 not subscribers this channel so I'm going 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.860
 do them and in addition she was of 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:43.360
 bad quality 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.600
 so that will allow everyone to 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:51.600
 enjoy and see if I have not forgotten 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:53.710
 something in passing so then 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.550
 it was done there so it's the effect 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.890
 aspire so that's where I actually 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.989
 do quite often in a thousand graf and 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.420
 that I find pretty cool and that it is 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.580
 super easy to do so I wanted 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.860
 you share it 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.450
 so then first of all we'll take a 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.450
 support so a letter 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.360
 so here we go 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.960
 so here is firstly for the 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.850
 breathe is to create a 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.460
 vanishing Point 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.570
 so I told him if for example good 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.310
 that we can lead him so not for all 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.810
 years later according to your desires and then 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.580
 we are going to make progress 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:42.220
 so we're going to take that kind that side 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:46.030
 of the letter we will start so a 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:50.670
 base to its curves and at the beginning and after 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:52.979
 gnawing at a just a trait at the fast going 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.930
 towards the vanishing point 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.540
 so then we can resume 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.729
 so ironing over the trait is 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.690
 always in cure wind suddenly 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.970
 sees a kind of a kind of spades 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.800
 which comes out of the letter 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.200
 and there we give right away with so 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.750
 right next we go on we understand 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.239
 do different sizes so 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.630
 often to prevent these overloads 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:23.200
 must always varied sizes avoid 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.930
 it's a bit weird so 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:30.160
 after another effect of very so that's 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.600
 that we will not go back directly to the 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.890
 following the very like here as a noise 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:38.890
 we're just going to be next and curves and 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:42.489
 there like that it feels like sorting 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.440
 was not finished and then we continue 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.040
 so after we were always a ward 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:51.750
 varied 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.750
 we make it a tool you have like that 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.810
 always had to expect 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:08.350
 also an effect of depth to the letter 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:11.790
 so there like that so what we can 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:14.500
 also do is we can do a 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.760
 will drive on the inside of the 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.650
 letter so for example this side there we 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.660
 can bring in from the inside 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.570
 so always the same so we're going 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.110
 take the continuation of the line and we will 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:37.450
 bring him 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:45.160
 so like this so here it is then we 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:47.500
 has other good and who are inspired years 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.750
 before an effect enough blow enough I 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.910
 therefore find no need to put in 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.060
 everywhere on the being that that risk of 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:59.680
 drive overloaded and ultimately you 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.209
 go to the super -choice ramp so the 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:07.090
 better it would be found a happy medium 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:08.830
 and 2 have found the right number so lajus 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.290
 that I want to do is I'm going 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:24.040
 Black board is for you had you 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:25.840
 see better so here's what we can 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.290
 also to result in even more 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.290
 depth 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.540
 this tale to add filters and in 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.820
 does it look as if when we take the 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.820
 sort that we did not finish at the base 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.440
 flat like it can be inside 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.960
 so always try to have a more 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:46.840
 big traits in base is to finish at these 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:50.490
 fund so here we learn see this is 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.490
 always a repetitive after 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:58.650
 here is to know 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.650
 if you pass me 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:11.110
 so here is of course the story 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:12.400
 interior affairs fake no 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:16.210
 ironing stupidly on the entrance so 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:22.150
 always take the tricks 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:25.680
 learned from within so here it is 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:28.120
 that's what it would give roughly 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.569
 a letter my case warns day where the 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:35.379
 made for any fan graf so here is me 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:36.639
 I think I have said everything so ask 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:38.080
 questions in the comments if I 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:42.460
 forgot something and then I 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:45.370
 answer so she tells you baye the 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.560
 people and at the next tutorial so this will 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:51.180
 for the next week 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.180
 good here is hi everyone
