00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:09.980
 and in cars drive alone has 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:12.890
 that remain a dream not when 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.050
 tries to fort under certain conditions 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:18.590
 soon we will be able to come a little closer 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:21.529
 more to that dream where they are said 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.380
 conditions where driving is 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.869
 It becomes less fun in a traffic jam 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.270
 the road in this environment there are some 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.489
 well-differentiated tracks by rule 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.940
 usually no pedestrians or animals or 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:37.490
 cyclists and the speed is minimal 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.560
 Fort engineers are working on 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:42.050
 an assistant for tacos that is in charge 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:46.070
 completely from braking driving and 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:48.260
 start in stop and go mode by term 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.150
 half the drivers spend more than 30 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.670
 percent of their time in traffic jams or 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.680
 slow traffic surely that time 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.740
 could be used more useful than 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.470
 simply driving the technical base 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.570
 for this form of autonomous driving 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.369
 lies both in the development and the 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.500
 combination of current systems 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.570
 driving assistance 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.640
 the warning of involuntary change 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.100
 lane now has new cameras 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.960
 more accurate even at very high speeds 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.479
 reduced for the vehicle to be 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.000
 keep the system in your lane 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.700
 by radar and camera is oriented respect 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.619
 to the vehicle that goes ahead even before 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.930
 a sudden incorporation of another 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.030
 vehicle to rail the system is capable 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.850
 with the data that it has 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.070
 keep the vehicle in the lane in addition 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.100
 the driver is notified of the change in 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.930
 situation as usual today 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.450
 the speed regulation system 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.180
 adapts to driving speed at 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.240
 front vehicle equally in case of 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.310
 need optimized access slows down 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.350
 until the vehicle is completely stopped and 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.080
 start driving again in the same way 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.509
 autonomous as soon as the 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.700
 jam the system invites immediately 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:02.200
 the driver to regain control of the 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.200
 automobile and driving it
