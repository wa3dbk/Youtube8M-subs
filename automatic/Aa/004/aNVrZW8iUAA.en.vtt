pretty much the only person who thought
that<00:00:58.290> I<00:00:58.710> fought<00:00:59.190> that's<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.550> Verne's<00:00:59.760> best

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:00.060 
that I fought that's the Verne's best

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.700 
that I fought that's the Verne's best
chance<00:01:00.329> was<00:01:00.510> earlier<00:01:00.810> in<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.989> fight<00:01:01.170> when<00:01:01.590> he

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
chance was earlier in the fight when he

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.200 
chance was earlier in the fight when he
was<00:01:01.829> still<00:01:02.010> fresh<00:01:02.340> because<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.820> Verne's<00:01:03.030> got

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
was still fresh because the Verne's got

and having slow feet like that his feet

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.670 
and having slow feet like that his feet
are<00:01:12.479> not<00:01:12.570> gonna<00:01:12.720> get<00:01:12.900> quicker<00:01:13.170> as<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.500> fight

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
are not gonna get quicker as the fight

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.590 
are not gonna get quicker as the fight
goes<00:01:13.890> on<00:01:14.100> they're<00:01:14.550> gonna<00:01:14.670> get<00:01:14.820> slower<00:01:15.150> that's

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
goes on they're gonna get slower that's

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.210 
goes on they're gonna get slower that's
why<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:15.780> felt<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.260> Verne's<00:01:16.470> best<00:01:16.770> chance<00:01:17.040> was

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
why I felt the Verne's best chance was

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.680 
why I felt the Verne's best chance was
early<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.790> fight<00:01:18.000> if<00:01:18.180> he<00:01:18.270> was<00:01:18.390> gonna<00:01:18.510> win

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
early in the fight if he was gonna win

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.660 
early in the fight if he was gonna win
it<00:01:18.870> the<00:01:19.229> later<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.680> goes<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.040> better<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.549> was

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
it the later it goes the better it was

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.010 
it the later it goes the better it was
gonna<00:01:20.820> be<00:01:20.970> for<00:01:21.180> Wilder<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.570> sounded

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
gonna be for Wilder that sounded

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.469 
gonna be for Wilder that sounded
counterintuitive<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.460> most<00:01:23.940> people<00:01:24.330> but

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
counterintuitive to most people but

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.210 
counterintuitive to most people but
that's<00:01:24.630> how<00:01:24.870> I<00:01:25.110> felt<00:01:25.620> he<00:01:25.710> was<00:01:25.740> gonna<00:01:25.950> beat<00:01:26.190> it

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
that's how I felt he was gonna beat it

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.580 
that's how I felt he was gonna beat it
wild<00:01:27.180> his<00:01:27.270> best<00:01:27.450> opportunity<00:01:27.990> was<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.290> box

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
wild his best opportunity was to box

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.340 
wild his best opportunity was to box
long<00:01:28.890> stick<00:01:29.760> to<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:29.940> gameplan<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.630> knew<00:01:30.810> mark

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
long stick to a gameplan and I knew mark

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.700 
long stick to a gameplan and I knew mark

there was a couple moments where he got
hit<00:03:58.410> and<00:03:58.530> he<00:03:58.590> looked<00:03:58.769> a<00:03:58.829> bit<00:03:58.859> off-balance<00:03:59.099> but

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
hit and he looked a bit off-balance but

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.089 
hit and he looked a bit off-balance but
I<00:04:00.569> don't<00:04:01.260> know<00:04:01.319> I<00:04:01.349> don't<00:04:01.500> think<00:04:01.769> he<00:04:01.859> was<00:04:01.950> really

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099

hurt<00:04:02.370> in<00:04:02.489> my<00:04:02.519> personal<00:04:03.090> opinion<00:04:03.480> I<00:04:03.599> don't

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
hurt in my personal opinion I don't

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.059

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
think stubborn actually managed to shake

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:06.319 
think stubborn actually managed to shake
him<00:04:05.220> up<00:04:05.280> I<00:04:05.400> think<00:04:05.459> water<00:04:05.760> took<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.120> shots

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329
