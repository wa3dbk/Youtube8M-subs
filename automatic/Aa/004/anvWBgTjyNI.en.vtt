00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.300
 hello people and welcome to one 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.920
 new tutorial of minecraft evil 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.360
 Today I would like to show you how 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.190
 one from a light switch 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.080
 I have something to do here 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:22.300
 prepared yes then go in 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.660
 this well if we the switch 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.650
 I will not press now 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.920
 because a monastery goes down from above 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:36.519
 Let's press the switch again 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.890
 does a callcenter drive how to do that? 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:41.470
 entire construction debt 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.410
 demonstrations and often people just go 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.149
 out again yes and up here I have 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.480
 that's why we have the whole thing hidden 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:51.100
 but a box like this is falling here 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.239
 not continue on so you can see 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.489
 The construction does not give us a good one 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:58.420
 method yes then here i have one now 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.620
 built house down as prepared and we 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.829
 Here are the light switch 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.989
 insert it now to the materials 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.880
 as usual in the box we need 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.300
 paving stones or the 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.119
 material from which year expanded 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:18.369
 then we need a sticky piston 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:22.660
 redstone exactly three redstone torches and 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:27.509
 yes then three fixed amplifiers then two 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:29.679
 normal piston a monastery and a button 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.369
 So let's start now 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:37.179
 So first we need the hole where 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:41.410
 you have your light is yes for it take 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:46.780
 I have the hole here now I have 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:51.009
 the things unfortunately they just forget you 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:54.429
 quickly down stronger pistons 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:57.250
 the button so now you go back to 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:02:01.569
 house first we need a row here 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.860
 of five popstars or paving stones 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:04.450
 pointed to German hot 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.580
 then there are two blocks left here 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.000
 we remove the possible down 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:13.360
 Now we come to the piston here 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.480
 a piston here and there is the piston 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.100
 then always put that in yours 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.130
 direction show so you look at the 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.290
 area of ​​the piston as well and for that 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.550
 and the two pistons show exactly 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:30.640
 Now we come to this 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.850
 Sticky butt yes I have to go here 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:37.209
 sit down or forget about blog yes here 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.950
 the sticky butt comes and you 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:43.209
 just have to look up there that up 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.640
 you have something so fast I have 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:50.020
 devoted myself to order the course so 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:53.380
 now we come to popsong the 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.870
 come here that holder of the material 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.090
 what your house is now come like it 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.520
 in the redstone torches one arrives at this 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.040
 know and at this blog so that 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.800
 pistes are now activated to the 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.920
 Bidders need to be on this blog 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.450
 show the had where the red and torches 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.580
 it's your turn and you do not have to 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.200
 adjust 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.549
 yes and now we come to the monastery for it 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.140
 Let's remove that torch here 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.630
 sat down here in the monastery and 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:25.180
 the facts happen again 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:27.220
 yes now we have to stop the slopes 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.000
 is then pushed down as soon as I get the 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.680
 put torch here that would be it now 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.269
 actually with the construction so 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.010
 far 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.810
 and so now I will show you again how 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.070
 It works to remove the torch 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.280
 put the torch there we have one 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.959
 signal is triggered and now is the monastery 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.459
 downstairs and the carlsson on the other 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.040
 Now we want the whole thing yes 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.209
 Of course, still connect 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.430
 for that to happen as I do here one 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:54.519
 liter with it will activate the torch 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.080
 can and connect the whole here 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.330
 below with our button we 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.750
 place 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:03.280
 We have to go here for that 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.860
 cork head but put better 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.489
 here again to the restaurant 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.640
 Now let's go inside the house 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.239
 place 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.160
 right here these coversong where the button 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.130
 that must be exactly the back of the must 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.989
 are departmental 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:22.070
 comes the button and so we test it 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:25.910
 all we press the tight and there comes 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:29.320
 it so now we have the press again 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.790
 we a glossary close the door 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.610
 I show you now I show you how 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:37.460
 the whole thing is covered up here 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.080
 that works quite simple and that is 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.770
 around here 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:45.130
 outside a corvette I build times 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.130
 just go there 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.000
 yes and here we have to be careful with that 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.140
 restaurant that will not finish it 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.060
 It is very important for us to be here 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:59.810
 no block sets but above it 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.370
 otherwise we have no signal how to get here 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.800
 can see and then there is no 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.890
 Signal then and the repeater will not 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.560
 with the rescue torch act that one 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:11.770
 blog I come there one 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.880
 here over here again wall to the turn 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.630
 then I feel like a key here 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:20.330
 I had previously provided as 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.380
 Block with the torch destroyed at the moment 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.160
 I just sat down again 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:29.780
 every block and the torch computer 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:32.990
 Just up here is the blanket 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:35.060
 fill is no signal disrupted 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.790
 everything works here again 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:41.240
 fill out and now gives us all the 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:43.130
 Seasonal wiring can hide 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.660
 we build an outside around 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.400
 Here we can now set the block 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:50.440
 because no signal is disturbed 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.440
 then we build ourselves down 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:06:00.350
 here yes then here again in the 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:06.140
 side then no signal 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:09.620
 asked I need here again 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:13.340
 here it could just shut up like that 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.190
 how I do that well here and still 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.070
 a blog 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.200
 then yes we do here another two back 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:21.630
 so that looks better 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:23.660
 now we have everything half hidden yes 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:26.490
 here too , I have forgotten 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.350
 Now if we go in and the house 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:36.540
 we test the whole again if it 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:38.340
 works yes that would be so far and 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.200
 yes then I thank you for it 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.820
