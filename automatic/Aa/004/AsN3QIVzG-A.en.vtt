00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.290

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:55.450
 apart from many people say that it is also 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.270
 another that can be where you are to create 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.090

 corner says local open in port 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:26.000
 49 thousand 628 the truth of their number does not 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.850
 it matters but then once this is done 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.190

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:38.800
 can see I'm in survival mode 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:40.750
 what I wanted to do a creative way 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.500
 the only thing they have to register 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.750
 the letter t 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:49.550
 the diagonal that not only very well how it 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:52.100
 Flame become fashionable 1 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.710

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.220

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.849
 be flying again

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.930
 but there is nothing 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.040
 and that 's how easy it is 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:34.110
 now if you are wondering how 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:37.959
 we change in that way to ways his rival 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.850
 Really easy to put air Parketxe 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:43.030
 that we also take food before 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:46.990
 that so that we will be in survival 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:49.680
 do not see here is the sixth block of 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:52.670
 decoration the remains 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.670
 transportation 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.890
 year 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.800
 and then everything here we have the weapons 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:03.230
 all that food 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.519
 the truth is that I no longer use it. 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:10.220
 for the experience because I need it 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:13.190
 the experience as we do not have opep 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.210
 public what I do is go 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:19.740
 Where was it 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:23.130

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:26.190

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.480
 and that's a bit of a cheat but 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:59.199
 experience because in fact I almost did not 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.509
 I use it only when I have 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:04.779
