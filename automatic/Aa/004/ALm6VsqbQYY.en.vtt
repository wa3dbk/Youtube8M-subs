00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.880

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:33.210
 color you're just brown coffee but remember 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.409
 that is not worth gym 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.409

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.700
 what it says here 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.390
 I think it says what night so fast what 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.130
 that they say I put you not time because 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.480
 You already know that I do not like to do or what 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.700
 wave buf there is a lot here is why 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.970
 almost did not record those who skyworks for the 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.490
 lag and I walk with fear seriously no longer 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.550
 can play with you rays how bad though 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.100
 happen here you did not miss 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:10.149
 you did not miss anything 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:13.659
 It can not be no jo jo jo 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:16.000
 not what's happening here, I'm already silent if I'm already 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:19.090
 it grew I can not write anything and I'm 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.810
 played here rays what the wave 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.810
 what happened 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.769
 what a ripple it is that you know her, I fall 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.379
 every time they are more crazy these sky one 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.830
 I do not understand anything, I thought I had 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.870
 let me see if you can enter another 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.820
 to see and here I can not do many 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.880
 cuts because they are not very long 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:42.580
 you wait and although I enter another one I wait 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.650
 this one is more stable to why there is 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.080
 both the rays and my internet connection 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.840
 it's fine a moment ago I just got out 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.220
 of this mobile if you create vision to your 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.990
 moment has just left the games of 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.940
 laure so the connection is fine not 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.190
 I understand why because you are and so 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.170
 Wanted the sky wash also that I 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.610
 They come down, I like Sky Wars 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:05.920
 but they are very, very blocked now 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:11.050
 I do not know what else there is still good and they're going 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:13.360
 inside yes great sijena ha ha ha 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.250
 and remember what I remember that new 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.260
 team and good I do not know what else to comment 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:24.120
 If I run out of ideas radios 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:27.569
 to ok and yes good about minecraft 0.11 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.459
 remember that you try to pass 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.829
 although I'm already inside or rays was 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.319
 Private maybe I 'm not here remember 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:38.819
 that I will try to pass the 0.11 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:41.489
 point x what will come out and good 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.920
 I will pass them but keep in mind that 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.349
 It still does not come out so they do not ask me 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.849
 because I do not know who I do not know who 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:53.909
 has been tolerating and this has already gone up 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:55.709
 he died he stayed in 8 seconds rays to 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:59.579
 see again where is where are you 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:01.769
 number to see here are you do not hide 4 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:03.150
 3 2 1 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.540
 I am not the one who is spoiling them 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.639
 there is still a lot but serious so there is a 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:12.450
 the end I will not be able to record a thousand 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:15.330
 sorry, I will not be able to record 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.870
 here is ok it appears yes well let's 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:20.669
 continue and if you remember that you are 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.240
 entering do not pay attention to them but what 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:26.940
 public me nobody else to joke but 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:29.280
 look at pages or channels 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:33.570
 trust do not believe anyone who 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:35.310
 tell them or trust another one below is 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.080
 way good to me not personally not 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.150
 I like trolling them so it's very 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.030
 difficult for me to trolleys like that 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.400
 with things like that the 4 lear with 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.260
 other very simple things but not from 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.350
 of those things seriously that does not do not 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.850
 I really like it so do not believe them I 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.740
 I will always try to be honest with 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.320
 you are more I am honest with 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.770
 you and remember that if you did not publish it 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.770
 I therefore 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:04.740
 and I will not be able to record at ease 

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:06.210
 Excuse me excuse me seriously 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.669
 for the sky wars but they are very 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.069
 unstable I wanted to record at ease but 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:13.199
 you can not anyway I'm going to go up 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:15.089
 this video as well as they see it I'm going to 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:17.309
 go up but it's not because I want to go up 

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:19.409
 filthy or something to the channel not that 

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:21.599
 I want you to know because if I do not record in 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:23.639
 sky wars is for this reason that almost 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:26.159
 I do not record in sky wars because there's 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:28.860
 many there is a lot there is of everything to 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:31.080
 those who fall less games and good 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.729
 I hope not that you did not like it 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.889
 this video because obviously it's not going to 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:36.960
 like I did nothing and my good 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:38.729
 apologies are very unstable the sky 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.120
 I would have liked to record them but 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:44.159
 they are practically impossible to record and 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.599
 sometimes what happens these days, well, I'm going 

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:47.699
 to see what I can do to play with 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:50.899
 we'll see you later 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:50.899
 bye thanks
