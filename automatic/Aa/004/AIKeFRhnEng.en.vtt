00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.359
 Aurelian direction Cagnes-sur-Mer 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.970
 gallop a test for 5 years and over 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.609
 2000 meters psf fiber sand track 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.500
 will be its importance a lot of quality 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.130
 with horses we know well in 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.750
 this kind of fight 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.420
 actually know them practically 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.500
 all in this kind of category a lot 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.130
 have already gained at this level of the 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.140
 competition 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.910
 so it's a pretty clear event 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.350
 clear enough to listen we'll see if 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.030
 you made a pretty good prognosis 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.460
 crystal clear we listen to you 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.610
 then comes back the three special request 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.320
 the 6 Belgian cagan the number 11 my little 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.559
 darling 9 al malik 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.239
 the 'new look' says nachi the a8 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.550
 Curiously there is finally the earth of 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.620
 west babel ok regarding your favorite 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.180
 number three special horse request 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.359
 who won on this course it was in 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.470
 the price of the old port in 2014 pretty much 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.540
 the same date we talked about it just before 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.470
 the show the horse is child we go 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.700
 to say that it is practically the basis 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.350
 must-attend event 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.210
 yes yes it's the real one 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.760
 specialist in fiber sand tracks 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.020
 against 8 successes on this surface 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.180
 lately in deauville has slightly 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.710
 disappointed in ranking 6th now there is 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.330
 a lot shot during the course there 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.670
 evolved rope side a portion of track 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.020
 which did not necessarily benefit much 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.220
 of competitors since the beginning of 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.619
 deauville meeting 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.020
 so I think we have to take it back in 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.250
 the more the lot seems to reach it already has 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.790
 compete with many of his rivals 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.590
 of the day 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.180
 I think he should answer this 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.290
 especially when we like to know him by 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.299
 heart it's clear we're going we're going 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.549
 buy back in confidence wanted to oppose the 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.500
 number 6 bilka earn 100% success 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.360
 in Cagnes-sur-Mer a success and a 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.250
 accessit and in particular a success it was 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.479
 the price jacques bouchara it was on 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.009
 1600 meters psf 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.869
 we know he has his problem 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.229
 2000 meters it's pretty opposition 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.689
 logic 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.740
 yes in addition xavier thomas demeault done 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.509
 call to stone charles boudot 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.040
 because charles boudot is in great shape 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.020
 euphoric he showed it with the 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.060
 competitors of gentleman prod in 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.920
 doing both arrivals I think 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.689
 sincerely that bild cagan lately 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.220
 do not condemn it because 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.759
 it was a special race 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.920
 he stayed in the back guard he 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.939
 get closer his jockey saw that 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.739
 it was not possible he quickly 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:16.750
 laid his hands he took back from the 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.329
 freshness since he had besides 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.890
 preceded by aureus mentaires which I 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:22.989
 retained in my prognosis a little more 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.810
 down in the selection to angers lion 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.459
 he ran very well that day I think 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.329
 sincerely he has a first chance 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.069
 in this event 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:32.319
 especially that the sand he likes that in the 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.670
 events 8 of 12 that's fine it's the 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:37.329
 trust had to believe we will have understood 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.829
 in third position the number 11 my 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:41.739
 little darling it's not a statement I 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:43.420
 prefers has specified 80% of success on the 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.640
 psf in 2014 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.799
 two victories two accessits is so 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.760
 a failure the horse is at the top he has 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.500
 took a little bit of freshness 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.670
 it's not bad also now there is 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.810
 number 16 in the stalls but I believe 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.069
 do not worry about it at all 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.829
 because it's a competitor 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.510
 prefer to wait so this is not a 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.500
 worry his jockey can take him back the 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.090
 place at the rear guard 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.260
 he showed even lately that they 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.639
 could bypass the horses they 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.420
 were in the final turning in 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:06.190
 third thickness 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.780
 he bypassed everyone he won 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.889
 quite easily that day she got me 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.750
 by the way surprised because the lot 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:12.489
 was still well composed he 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.139
 really done very easily I think 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.329
 that it can continue its momentum in 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:18.430
 fit he learned cold morale 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.629
 in his little races with conditions I 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.879
 really think he has his say 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:23.370
 here in addition to the boarders of jacques 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:25.510
 rossi displays an optimal shape 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.160
 so we really have all the reasons 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.750
 also to think who will argue 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.940
 the arrival of teeth listen we have three 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.370
 good bases already in this quinté + 5 5 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.790
 in fourth position the number 9 al 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.370
 malik 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.709
 already placed on this track last 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.019
 attempt on the sand is a success 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.540
 it was in deauville last august 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.220
 also to the paper difficult to dismiss it 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.720
 actually lately he has 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.799
 shown a little disappointing even at his 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.569
 last two attempts 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.980
 he flatly refused to take the 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.150
 departure practically since it remained 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.400
 in his stall they were losing ground 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.049
 now xavier is only ten minutes away 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.579
 blinkers this time is 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.260
 certainly to motivate him further 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:00.970
 it's a competitor anyway 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.109
 point out that he shot down competitors 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.150
 as such case this summer 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:05.859
 fourteen bodies a first chance here 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.909
 would be class struggle and I think 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:08.650
 Sincerely, we must take it back 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:10.599
 appreciate the surface he likes on this 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.099
 type of distance it is stamped with this 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:12.849
 enemy now his situation has become 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.590
 significantly improved 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:16.639
 he really has the means to put the 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.900
 pendulums on time well we'll see if 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.909
 coach xavier nakkachdji is 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.650
 agree with you since manu rivron 

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:25.699
 joined him on the phone is the time 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.620
 from our ground minute we listen to the 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:30.409
 kabylie you're commenting almaric in the 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.330
 quinté Tuesday at Cagnes-sur-Mer al 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:33.219
 maliki finished 2014 on two against 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.080
 performances 

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:36.439
 what an idiot can say his last two 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.699
 exits 

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:42.169
 logical bah for these two these two 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:44.270
 performances and two behind 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.759
 that seemingly are not very good 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.240
 can think of the hypothesis of the little shot 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:49.219
 pump 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.779
 because he did not hurt that 

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:52.789
 is all year with started his 

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:54.169
 season by the way to cagnes sur mer 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:55.789
 lille to the eco quite regularly 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:59.479
 winner at deauville in bray dunes weather 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:00.740
 before the arrival of conquest and in the region 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:04.129
 Parisian also we can perhaps 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:06.529
 think of the little stroke of fatigue in the end 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:08.360
 season that is so often put 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:08.810
 with horses that ran all over 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.849
 year-round 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.139
 but me personally I have another 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:13.400
 reading these two bad 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:15.740
 quite wide part performance 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.830
 looks pretty bad starting is that 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.439
 we always let it go and 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.849
 we did not rush it and we 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:25.069
 as employees watch before 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:26.750
 to finish well and me the reading is 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:29.449
 that by dint of running like that he has 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.039
 learned life from the good side of them the 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:32.330
 shopping does not motivate a lot because 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.939
 that he is so much rear guard 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.399
 we do not bother much and as long as he 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:38.689
 was cool and willing to define it without 

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:40.430
 the others with good results at the 

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:42.050
 key but at the end of the year can be 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.149
 with three drops of fatigue 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.259
 he was a little let live and 

00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:46.399
 that's why Tuesday there 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:50.270
 will wear blinkers not the first 

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:51.889
 times for xavier nakkachdji who is arm 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.789
 who will have to do a little bit I'm doing the 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:54.110
 knows a little pump stroke 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:55.939
 now it'll be better 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.500
 from behind will benefit him so we will 

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:58.969
 beware that it can be on horseback 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.409
 interesting in this test in 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:02.930
 fifth position had placed the number 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:04.669
 a new outlook then on horseback who 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.409
 possesses incontestable title to this 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:09.589
 level it's probably the most titrated 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:11.000
 they appreciate this surface 61 kg 

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:12.080
 now it's a quality horse 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.279
 in quotation marks so it's not too much of a 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.870
 problem but I think they deserve 

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:17.060
 without can simply it has already 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.899
 showed its competitiveness at this level at x 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.250
 hold 

00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:20.719
 ioritz mendizabal moreover uses it 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.949
 perfectly it's not a horse 

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:23.300
 obviously practical we had seen 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:24.280
 especially in an apprentice race 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.690
 with Belgian 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.820
 but even pinard who had had 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.470
 difficulties with him there he finds 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.480
 ioritz mendizabal who knows him 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:33.250
 recently it perfectly in Toulouse 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.810
 made a good end of race because 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.280
 that he was a long time back in a 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.930
 more rhythmic pace he came 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.490
 almost looking for the winner is when 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.200
 not bad this performance sand 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:43.419
 he loves that distance too 

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.040
 then good hiding that it depends 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:46.450
 from a training of fabrice chappet to 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.460
 canes fabrice chappet it's often a 

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:50.139
 coach to follow so I think that 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.919
 new look here despite the weight he has the 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:52.540
 ways to shine 

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:55.030
 well we understood you are given the 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.480
 quinté + 5 5 in 5 1 we will not seek 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.700
 further 

00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:00.220
 we added 3 but it's good for the 

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.750
 form we will stop there thank you comes back 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.010
 for all information thank you 

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.520

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:05.080

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.640
 it will not be me it will be alexander of 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.240
 kaufman with thomas arnaud for a 

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.740
 quinted more 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.870
