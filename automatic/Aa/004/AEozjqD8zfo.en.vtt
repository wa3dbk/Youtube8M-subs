00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.840
 this is just . 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.690
 Yes 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.430
 Ivan Ivanovitch I have a kind of question 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.260
 tell me what is going on here 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.760
 blasting and that this is in the final 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.380
 the result will bring the Krasnoyarsk iron 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.770
 here we are doing explosive work for 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:03.600
 to lengthen to san sue jock 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:06.000
 stream get rid of the curve which 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.160
 greatly reduces the speed of movement 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.100
 trains which transit go through this 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.580
 station this will allow Krasnoyarsk iron 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.280
 the road immediately raise the throughput 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.860
 This sectionâ€™s ability is a train 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.380
 leaving at a speed of 60 70 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:26.720
 kilometers an hour it will allow very much 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.620
 boost and so very understated 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.090
 working area at us on this 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.530
 the stretch jeep shtorkin just 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.370
 ability is only twenty 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.470
 seven pairs of trains 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.440
 this is the most limiting haul 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.140
 Krasnoyarsk railway and 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.810
 here we are implementing this project 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:46.200
 achieve 33 pairs of trains it will allow 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.700
 the ever- increasing loading of which she 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.459
 red in which the genome in kan 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:54.110
 The region is born here to organize 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.110
 skip and provide 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.780
 but
