surface<00:00:16.049> is<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.650> we're<00:00:16.770> going<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:16.949> get<00:00:17.070> it

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
surface is and we're going to get it

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.140 
surface is and we're going to get it
straight<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:19.070> all<00:00:20.070> along<00:00:20.460> see<00:00:20.760> on<00:00:20.850> me<00:00:21.000> the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
straight and all along see on me the

00:00:21.150 --> 00:01:17.830 
straight and all along see on me the
houses<00:00:21.449> that<00:00:21.600> move<00:00:22.020> off<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:22.289> this<00:00:22.560> block<00:00:23.240> okay

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.510 

three<00:01:18.140> thousands<00:01:18.740> and<00:01:18.890> you<00:01:18.950> can<00:01:19.100> see<00:01:19.280> that<00:01:19.429> the

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
three thousands and you can see that the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.120 
three thousands and you can see that the
block<00:01:19.700> is<00:01:19.909> pretty<00:01:20.149> much

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
block is pretty much

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.469 
block is pretty much
square<00:01:21.810> exception<00:01:22.810> of<00:01:22.900> the

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.740 

change<00:01:26.479> agency

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
change agency

00:01:28.750 --> 00:02:38.449 
change agency
a<00:01:28.780> gasket

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.630 

see<00:02:39.090> basically<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.720> mirror<00:02:39.930> image<00:02:40.260> of<00:02:40.409> the

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
see basically the mirror image of the

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.030 
see basically the mirror image of the
where<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.730> cylinder<00:02:42.030> head<00:02:42.269> was<00:02:42.450> long<00:02:42.829> we<00:02:43.829> left

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
where the cylinder head was long we left

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.690 
where the cylinder head was long we left
the<00:02:44.159> shadow<00:02:44.430> of<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.180> casket<00:02:45.659> area

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.440 

because<00:02:49.209> he<00:02:49.360> basically<00:02:49.510> this<00:02:49.930> Jagga<00:02:50.260> outline

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
because he basically this Jagga outline

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
because he basically this Jagga outline
across<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.140> low<00:02:52.260> squat

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
across the low squat

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.890 
across the low squat
and<00:02:53.800> also<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.940> very<00:02:55.150> back<00:02:55.420> of<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.690> block

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
and also the very back of the block

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.750 
and also the very back of the block
isn't<00:02:56.200> square

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
isn't square

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.490 
isn't square
so<00:02:58.120> basically<00:02:58.510> when<00:02:58.750> they<00:02:58.870> machined<00:02:59.260> it<00:02:59.379> from

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
so basically when they machined it from

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.649 
so basically when they machined it from
the<00:02:59.560> factory<00:03:00.330> plus<00:03:01.330> you<00:03:01.900> know<00:03:02.019> the<00:03:02.739> ideas<00:03:03.370> of

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
the factory plus you know the ideas of

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:06.210 
the factory plus you know the ideas of
cold<00:03:04.659> cycles<00:03:05.110> basically<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.620> block<00:03:05.799> is<00:03:05.980> a<00:03:06.010> bit

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
cold cycles basically the block is a bit

00:03:06.220 --> 00:04:08.080 
cold cycles basically the block is a bit
distorted<00:03:06.549> now

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:14.860 

seven<00:04:08.810> thousands<00:04:09.349> the<00:04:09.470> block<00:04:09.680> cleaned<00:04:10.010> up

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.970 

he<00:04:15.870> was<00:04:15.990> going<00:04:16.140> to<00:04:16.200> change<00:04:16.440> out<00:04:16.590> that<00:04:16.620> bit

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
he was going to change out that bit

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.120 
he was going to change out that bit
again<00:04:17.190> yeah

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.870 

at<00:04:20.820> the<00:04:20.940> restaurant<00:04:21.740> okay<00:04:22.770> we've<00:04:23.070> removed<00:04:23.730> the

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
at the restaurant okay we've removed the

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
at the restaurant okay we've removed the
final<00:04:24.360> of<00:04:24.660> nine<00:04:25.530> thousand<00:04:26.040> sofa<00:04:26.570> sets<00:04:27.570> block

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
final of nine thousand sofa sets block

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.230 
final of nine thousand sofa sets block
and<00:04:28.620> you<00:04:28.950> can<00:04:29.100> see<00:04:29.280> basically<00:04:29.490> from<00:04:30.000> what<00:04:30.150> it

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
and you can see basically from what it

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.820 
and you can see basically from what it
was<00:04:30.390> to<00:04:30.570> what<00:04:30.600> it<00:04:30.810> is<00:04:30.930> it's<00:04:31.230> like<00:04:31.290> my

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
that what Santa main goes then cylinder

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.970 
that what Santa main goes then cylinder
concentricity<00:05:27.030> goes<00:05:27.420> as<00:05:27.630> well<00:05:28.340> so<00:05:29.750> basically

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:30.980 
concentricity goes as well so basically

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.520 
concentricity goes as well so basically
the<00:05:31.980> way<00:05:32.100> that<00:05:32.130> this<00:05:32.430> machine<00:05:32.580> operates<00:05:33.240> is<00:05:33.530> I

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
the way that this machine operates is I

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.410 
the way that this machine operates is I
have<00:05:34.890> the<00:05:35.010> setting<00:05:35.280> fixture<00:05:35.610> setup<00:05:35.910> on<00:05:36.120> it<00:05:36.270> and

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:36.420 
have the setting fixture setup on it and

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.350 
have the setting fixture setup on it and
we<00:05:36.960> anticipate<00:05:37.440> that<00:05:37.770> this<00:05:38.370> block<00:05:38.880> may<00:05:39.090> clean

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
we anticipate that this block may clean

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.990 
we anticipate that this block may clean
up<00:05:39.510> at<00:05:39.630> twenty<00:05:39.840> thousand<00:05:40.230> so<00:05:40.320> Versailles<00:05:40.650> and

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
up at twenty thousand so Versailles and

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.380 
up at twenty thousand so Versailles and
I've<00:05:42.000> basically<00:05:42.650> adjusted<00:05:43.650> the<00:05:43.800> micrometer

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:44.390 
I've basically adjusted the micrometer

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.660 
I've basically adjusted the micrometer
as<00:05:45.390> well<00:05:45.660> as<00:05:45.810> my<00:05:45.990> dial<00:05:46.500> indicator<00:05:46.980> so<00:05:47.250> when<00:05:47.640> I

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:47.670 
as well as my dial indicator so when I

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.080 
as well as my dial indicator so when I
set<00:05:48.030> my<00:05:48.060> tool<00:05:48.390> bit<00:05:48.620> depth<00:05:49.620> it<00:05:50.340> should<00:05:50.640> read<00:05:50.850> the

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
set my tool bit depth it should read the

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.810 
set my tool bit depth it should read the
perfect<00:05:51.480> zero<00:05:51.860> with<00:05:52.860> the<00:05:52.890> amount<00:05:53.370> that<00:05:53.640> I've

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
perfect zero with the amount that I've

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.570 
perfect zero with the amount that I've
calculated<00:05:54.360> for<00:05:54.720> the<00:05:54.780> twenty<00:05:55.050> over<00:05:55.400> I've<00:05:56.400> got

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
calculated for the twenty over I've got

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.940 
calculated for the twenty over I've got
the<00:05:56.730> Machine<00:05:57.060> set<00:05:57.840> up<00:05:57.960> now<00:05:58.170> is<00:05:58.410> like<00:05:58.560> we<00:05:58.710> tried

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:58.950 
the Machine set up now is like we tried

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:59.710 
the Machine set up now is like we tried
the<00:05:59.100> first

00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 
the first

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970 
shot the pony Ola but unfortunately

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.960 
shot the pony Ola but unfortunately

going another 10,000 Imperial
the<00:06:11.419> rust<00:06:11.660> stain<00:06:11.870> on<00:06:12.110> the<00:06:12.289> wall<00:06:13.220> and<00:06:13.849> we<00:06:13.970> can

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
the rust stain on the wall and we can

00:06:14.120 --> 00:07:17.900 
the rust stain on the wall and we can
carry<00:06:14.360> on

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:17.910 

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:22.110 

we've<00:07:18.910> just<00:07:20.220> did<00:07:21.220> the<00:07:21.340> final<00:07:21.640> pass<00:07:21.820> and<00:07:22.090> I

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:22.120 
we've just did the final pass and I

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.220 
we've just did the final pass and I
clicked<00:07:22.390> it<00:07:22.540> clean<00:07:22.750> up<00:07:22.900> in<00:07:23.020> 30<00:07:23.230> over<00:07:23.590> and<00:07:25.230> after

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:26.230 
clicked it clean up in 30 over and after

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:28.740 
clicked it clean up in 30 over and after
I<00:07:26.260> boil<00:07:26.740> a<00:07:26.950> cylinder<00:07:27.430> we<00:07:27.970> have<00:07:28.120> to<00:07:28.240> channel<00:07:28.510> the

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:28.750 
I boil a cylinder we have to channel the

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:31.590 
I boil a cylinder we have to channel the
very<00:07:29.260> top<00:07:29.530> edge<00:07:29.740> so<00:07:29.770> we<00:07:30.130> can<00:07:30.310> aid<00:07:30.880> the<00:07:30.940> entry<00:07:31.480> of

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:31.600 
very top edge so we can aid the entry of

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.480 
very top edge so we can aid the entry of
the<00:07:31.690> piston<00:07:32.020> rings<00:07:32.230> once<00:07:32.740> come<00:07:33.220> time<00:07:33.460> for

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:33.490 
the piston rings once come time for

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.790 
the piston rings once come time for
assembly<00:07:33.910> so<00:07:34.690> there's<00:07:34.870> no<00:07:34.990> sharp<00:07:35.290> edge<00:07:35.500> at<00:07:35.650> the

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:35.800 
assembly so there's no sharp edge at the

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.440 
assembly so there's no sharp edge at the
at<00:07:36.130> the<00:07:36.250> very<00:07:36.280> top<00:07:36.670> of<00:07:36.730> the<00:07:36.940> cylinder<00:07:37.270> wall

here<00:07:37.690> and<00:07:38.140> you<00:07:38.260> just<00:07:38.410> want<00:07:38.560> to<00:07:38.590> make<00:07:38.740> a<00:07:38.770> little

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:39.060 
here and you just want to make a little

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.150 
here and you just want to make a little
absolutely<00:07:40.060> little<00:07:40.270> angle<00:07:40.630> as<00:07:40.800> the<00:07:41.800> fact<00:07:42.040> you

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:42.160 
absolutely little angle as the fact you

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.590 
absolutely little angle as the fact you
can<00:07:42.310> see<00:07:42.490> in<00:07:42.910> the<00:07:43.030> number<00:07:43.300> three<00:07:43.450> and<00:07:43.570> Oh

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:43.600 
can see in the number three and Oh

can see in the number three and Oh
before<00:07:43.930> that<00:07:44.110> the<00:07:44.230> factory<00:07:44.620> went<00:07:45.340> a<00:07:45.370> little

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:45.490 
before that the factory went a little

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:48.410 
before that the factory went a little
bit<00:07:45.700> overboard<00:07:46.000> on<00:07:46.450> their<00:07:47.140> chamfer<00:07:47.800> mark<00:07:48.040> but

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:48.420 
bit overboard on their chamfer mark but

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.540 
bit overboard on their chamfer mark but
it<00:07:49.420> serves<00:07:49.660> the<00:07:49.810> same<00:07:49.840> purpose

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:51.550 
it serves the same purpose
