 caged our camera cameraman 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:15.930
 mass of sicilia, however, this one here 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:19.100
 kage we eliminate the possible impurities the 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.750
 our work is his best 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.900
 here guys this is the case like this 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.570
 the space guards show up do it there 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:34.079
 will be to do number but boxing center and 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:36.180
 here we open and this friend of mine is 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.850
 here on the side we ordered ai 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.250
 same components so I am one 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.439
 already dismantled publishers 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.579
 so or maybe since the components 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.700
 that preceded it 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.799
 so i got a bit informed while in 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.200
 this word boxing here each 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.810
 component is the icon maybe a video clip 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.800
 this being said we conclude it 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:03.550
 unpacking the card 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:08.869
 which if we will do will be our hero z 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:10.850
 then ok fine this is the 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.070
 kaiser seen without plastic 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:17.600
 here I show the doors if there is one 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:21.440
 a USB 3.0 blue one USB 2.0 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:25.210
 ignition audio input and output e 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:29.060
 reset button on the side we find two 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:30.740
 holes that appears on the LED that is, 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.630
 when turned on and when it is running 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:37.210
 for the hard disk here instead 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:40.390
 we find the slots to insert any 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:43.520
 recorder anyway fan controller 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:47.420
 various things proclaimed this we move 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:50.510
 to the inside that we now believe 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.940
 maybe open using one of ours 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.650
 20,000 screwdrivers hoping to take 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.130
 the right one 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.950
 exactly what luck there is a city ​​from 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.110
 Our cameraman to our aide 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.690
 trust and asphalt date unscrewed the other 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:13.910
 here is no applause kept inside a 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:17.300
 this part we will find ole ole here 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.160
 yes you will so we find a box 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:23.300
 mysterious that we will open later 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.370
 then we find the various for the hard disk bars 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.400
 however which two are already installed 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:34.340
 fans this chris contains four 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:38.060
 3 fans 240 mm and one above in 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.070
 high under ayxta 200 if they were not but 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.440
 I should say right here we find mike a 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.410
 videclip connect to the colleague ram e 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:48.050
 motherboard and breed feeds 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:51.620
 fans are up here anyway though 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:54.590
 already shown two are here though 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:59.410
 since you don't see them I have to turn them over 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:03.680
 see you are there two is the last one is here 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.730
 see you maybe apple around ok now the 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.180
 you see 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.260
 said this 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.440
 maybe I'd say go for the box 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.870
 mysterious always with an accessory 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:18.010
 we use the cuter the excuse we use 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:21.070
 the scissors say this, being careful to 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.520
 don't cut the field of usb 3.0 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:27.040
 because if we are a bit prized 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.500
 in fact we should be ours 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:33.040
 box-like we will call for convenience purpose 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:39.300
 the mysterious we find at the second 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:39.300
 ok always material from the tav in areas 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:47.790
 of girls r 66 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:57.370
 here we find a cover for an adapter 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.770
 let's call it roughly so from 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:03.100
 put the card reader here for the animals 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:07.300
 however small writers like that 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.780
 take the whole shape of the whole 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:15.790
 slot 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:18.669
 then we find various bolts like screws 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:21.310
 these are called clamps for 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:24.940
 tighten the cables once the 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:29.620
 all as doing with eg of 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:32.020
 screw and rest we can find 21 screws 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:35.440
 for the motherboard then there are also 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:37.780
 the spacers that are these here 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:41.229
 however there is a lot of stuff all that 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:46.570
 reserve in short and finally we find in the 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:50.050
 mystical mysterious box the slots of 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:52.390
 slots yes for the hard disk and the rest 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.850
 of the things that will be put here 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:57.430
 so that you are here andrea you were in 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:06:02.590
 this way and veronica stuck by 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:05.710
 mind closed in these 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:07.690
 hooks we have from the director who asks 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.940
 he tells you the names very well he said 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:10.810
 this and I would say that this boxing can 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:15.430
 tell yourself with 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:17.169
 I apologize that is the back losers and the 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.900
 back here is this 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:21.389
 This step also this here is called 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.280
 brand hostage of cables 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:27.669
 we read that tells us everything 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.180
 but I never have to open the help 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:31.000
 manager 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:33.940
 we also thank him I want a like son 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.410
 et e help brushes menge prefetto him 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:38.700
 instead of the utilitarian life without 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:41.919
 screwdriver says he is tightening it 

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.730
 here is a live applause only for 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:45.389
 she but gen 

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:49.780
 the sentence I because it is removing the screws 

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:53.530
 ok perfect and now through a little 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:56.979
 difficult but we will succeed 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:58.930
 here we are we have taken from the other 

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:01.150
 part let's say we also find which slots 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:05.919
 to close because there is one aside 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:08.050
 and one from this we find we say gods 

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:10.150
 cable louver passages 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:12.700
 in fact you can put the lawns that 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:15.310
 they come in coming from here and that 

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:19.750
 come back from this loophole here so 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:22.780
 not to create too much chaos too much 

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:25.810
 volume we say inside the keys that there is 

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:29.380
 even today I have already mounted the first e 

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:31.780
 I must say that it is very not so big 

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:34.440
 so I recommend using this one 

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:37.000
 something totally covered by a part 

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:39.220
 secondary one we have disassembled 

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.200
 having said that I would say that unboxing packages 

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:43.060
 I hope I liked it not 

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.729
 he doesn't even take the others that will be 

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:47.200
 loaded in parallel to this here I will 

00:07:45.729 --> 00:07:48.580
 I say reminds you leave I don't like if 

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.840
 you liked to share videos that 

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:55.130
 let me know of my essence 

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:56.900
 and I of my assistants in the world 

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:58.370
 if you want some that someone 

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.930
 know of the existence of this case 

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:02.060
 then share the video themes 

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:03.800
 commented by writing what you think of us 

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:06.340
 see you next touch video and all 

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.340
 Hello
