team to dunk the ball please I know a

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.630 
team to dunk the ball please I know a
lot<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.770> people<00:00:46.860> aren't<00:00:47.129> gonna<00:00:47.219> go<00:00:47.399> for<00:00:47.610> that

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
lot of people aren't gonna go for that

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.729 
lot of people aren't gonna go for that
so<00:00:48.059> how<00:00:48.539> about<00:00:48.629> this<00:00:48.960> why<00:00:49.440> don't<00:00:49.620> we<00:00:49.710> just

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
so how about this why don't we just

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.410 
so how about this why don't we just
lower<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.460> hoop<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.789> little<00:00:51.000> bit<00:00:51.120> right<00:00:51.270> now

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
lower the hoop a little bit right now

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.900 
lower the hoop a little bit right now
it's<00:00:51.600> 10<00:00:51.899> feet<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.949> really<00:00:53.250> high<00:00:53.579> we

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
it's 10 feet that is really high we

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.369 
it's 10 feet that is really high we
could<00:00:54.059> lower<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.480> 9<00:00:54.690> feet<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.079> think<00:00:55.289> it

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
could lower it to 9 feet and I think it

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.200 
could lower it to 9 feet and I think it
would<00:00:55.500> make<00:00:55.649> dunks<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.039> real<00:00:56.219> possibility<00:00:56.460> well

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
would make dunks a real possibility well

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.729 
would make dunks a real possibility well
