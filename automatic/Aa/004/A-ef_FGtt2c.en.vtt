alright<00:04:40.460> let's<00:04:40.639> take<00:04:40.759> a<00:04:40.879> look<00:04:41.000> at<00:04:41.090> that<00:04:41.210> and

00:04:41.619 --> 00:04:41.629 
alright let's take a look at that and

alright let's take a look at that and
we'll<00:04:41.719> see<00:04:42.229> that<00:04:42.379> the<00:04:42.860> delayed<00:04:43.340> reaction<00:04:43.969> that

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
we'll see that the delayed reaction that

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.390 
we'll see that the delayed reaction that
you<00:04:44.599> see<00:04:44.750> that<00:04:44.900> was<00:04:45.169> average<00:04:45.710> was<00:04:45.949> a<00:04:45.979> left<00:04:46.250> hook

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
you see that was average was a left hook

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.399 
you see that was average was a left hook
attempt<00:04:46.849> was<00:04:47.120> a<00:04:47.210> delayed<00:04:47.509> reaction<00:04:47.689> just<00:04:48.289> like

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:48.409 
attempt was a delayed reaction just like
