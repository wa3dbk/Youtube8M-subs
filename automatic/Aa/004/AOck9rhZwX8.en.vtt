00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
nuking your way through the walls the

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.779 
nuking your way through the walls the
levels<00:01:43.960> are<00:01:44.110> extremely<00:01:44.469> destructive<00:01:45.399> and<00:01:45.729> I

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
levels are extremely destructive and I

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:47.190 
levels are extremely destructive and I
always<00:01:46.000> thought<00:01:46.149> it<00:01:46.240> was<00:01:46.329> funny<00:01:46.570> to<00:01:46.689> see<00:01:46.990> what

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
always thought it was funny to see what

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.719 
always thought it was funny to see what
a<00:01:47.229> level<00:01:47.530> looked<00:01:47.740> like<00:01:47.920> at<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.250> end<00:01:48.280> at<00:01:48.700> the

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
a level looked like at the end at the

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.609 
a level looked like at the end at the
start<00:01:49.180> everything's<00:01:49.750> nice<00:01:50.049> and<00:01:50.079> full<00:01:50.560> and

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
start everything's nice and full and

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.380 
start everything's nice and full and
well-built<00:01:51.310> and<00:01:51.549> overall<00:01:52.060> really

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
well-built and overall really

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.359 
well-built and overall really
well-designed<00:01:52.899> but<00:01:53.469> at<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:53.680> end<00:01:53.710> it's<00:01:54.130> all

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
well-designed but at the end it's all

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.969 
well-designed but at the end it's all
blown<00:01:54.969> to<00:01:55.210> hell<00:01:55.240> the<00:01:56.200> two<00:01:56.409> levels<00:01:56.829> you<00:01:56.950> can

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
blown to hell the two levels you can

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.219 
blown to hell the two levels you can
play<00:01:57.310> on<00:01:57.340> our<00:01:57.520> a<00:01:57.729> huge<00:01:58.180> house<00:01:58.479> and<00:01:58.810> a<00:01:58.930> plane

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
maps are really well tuned because

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.130 
maps are really well tuned because
they're<00:02:03.189> so<00:02:03.520> focused<00:02:03.909> on<00:02:04.299> close<00:02:04.659> quarter

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140

they're so focused on close quarter
combat<00:02:05.170> I<00:02:06.009> don't<00:02:06.280> think<00:02:06.460> I<00:02:06.549> ever<00:02:06.579> killed

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
outside about a 50-foot radius it felt

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.130 
outside about a 50-foot radius it felt
like<00:02:11.830> every<00:02:12.250> death<00:02:12.490> was<00:02:12.730> so<00:02:13.150> frustrating<00:02:14.020> and

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
like every death was so frustrating and

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.050 
like every death was so frustrating and
visceral<00:02:14.650> and<00:02:14.890> almost<00:02:15.040> made<00:02:15.250> me<00:02:15.280> scream<00:02:15.850> at

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
visceral and almost made me scream at

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.550 
visceral and almost made me scream at
times<00:02:16.300> because<00:02:16.570> it<00:02:16.930> just<00:02:17.110> felt<00:02:17.320> like<00:02:17.380> they

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
times because it just felt like they

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.950 
times because it just felt like they
outmaneuvered<00:02:18.520> me<00:02:18.550> are<00:02:18.820> outnumbered<00:02:19.570> me<00:02:19.780> with

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
outmaneuvered me are outnumbered me with

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.170 
outmaneuvered me are outnumbered me with
every<00:02:20.350> death<00:02:20.680> while<00:02:21.370> playing<00:02:21.670> on<00:02:21.850> the

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
playing level as a Counter Terrorist I

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.679 
playing level as a Counter Terrorist I
really<00:02:24.099> had<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.280> figure<00:02:24.549> out<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:24.819> map<00:02:25.150> as<00:02:25.329> fast

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:25.689 
really had to figure out the map as fast

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:27.720 
really had to figure out the map as fast
as<00:02:25.870> possible<00:02:26.140> and<00:02:26.500> try<00:02:26.709> and<00:02:26.769> build<00:02:27.040> up<00:02:27.250> all<00:02:27.489> the

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
as possible and try and build up all the

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.880 
as possible and try and build up all the
paths<00:02:28.000> in<00:02:28.359> my<00:02:28.599> head<00:02:28.870> because<00:02:29.170> it's<00:02:29.469> three

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
paths in my head because it's three

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.149 
paths in my head because it's three
floors<00:02:30.310> and<00:02:30.640> has<00:02:30.819> a<00:02:30.849> lot<00:02:31.269> of<00:02:31.480> winding<00:02:32.019> paths<00:02:32.349> in

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:33.159 
floors and has a lot of winding paths in

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:34.800 
floors and has a lot of winding paths in
the<00:02:33.400> plane<00:02:33.640> it<00:02:33.849> didn't<00:02:34.090> feel<00:02:34.180> like<00:02:34.239> terrorists

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
the plane it didn't feel like terrorists

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.199 
the plane it didn't feel like terrorists
door<00:02:35.109> blockers<00:02:35.590> did<00:02:35.859> very<00:02:36.159> much<00:02:36.280> good<00:02:36.760> unlike

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
door blockers did very much good unlike

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.089 
door blockers did very much good unlike
on<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.540> house<00:02:37.750> level<00:02:38.200> mostly<00:02:38.620> because<00:02:38.739> in<00:02:39.010> the

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
on the house level mostly because in the

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.860 
on the house level mostly because in the
plane<00:02:39.370> there's<00:02:39.639> three<00:02:39.939> or<00:02:40.030> four<00:02:40.269> ways<00:02:40.510> into

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
plane there's three or four ways into

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.890 
plane there's three or four ways into
and<00:02:41.379> out<00:02:41.500> of<00:02:41.560> every<00:02:42.159> room<00:02:42.459> even<00:02:43.060> if<00:02:43.299> I<00:02:43.389> ran<00:02:43.629> full

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
and out of every room even if I ran full

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.330 
and out of every room even if I ran full
speed<00:02:43.930> into<00:02:44.349> a<00:02:44.439> barricade<00:02:44.799> I<00:02:44.980> can<00:02:45.219> usually

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
speed into a barricade I can usually

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.610 
speed into a barricade I can usually
just<00:02:45.700> zip<00:02:46.000> around<00:02:46.329> it<00:02:46.480> with<00:02:46.629> zero<00:02:46.659> trouble<00:02:47.469> and

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
just zip around it with zero trouble and

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.839 
just zip around it with zero trouble and
it<00:02:47.680> usually<00:02:47.829> just<00:02:48.069> tipped<00:02:48.489> me<00:02:48.670> off<00:02:48.700> that

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
it usually just tipped me off that

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:50.399 
it usually just tipped me off that
there's<00:02:49.239> probably<00:02:49.510> something<00:02:49.750> important

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:50.409 
there's probably something important

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:53.039 
there's probably something important
like<00:02:50.469> a<00:02:50.620> hostage<00:02:50.980> inside<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:52.389> house<00:02:52.540> map<00:02:52.810> was

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
like a hostage inside the house map was

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:54.780 
like a hostage inside the house map was
a<00:02:53.079> little<00:02:53.319> easier<00:02:53.739> to<00:02:53.889> figure<00:02:54.189> out<00:02:54.310> overall

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
a little easier to figure out overall

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:55.949 
a little easier to figure out overall
but<00:02:55.060> only<00:02:55.239> because<00:02:55.329> they<00:02:55.510> had<00:02:55.659> a<00:02:55.689> lot<00:02:55.930> more

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
but only because they had a lot more

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.050 
but only because they had a lot more
human<00:02:56.680> landmarks<00:02:57.340> it<00:02:57.489> was<00:02:57.609> easy<00:02:57.909> to

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
human landmarks it was easy to

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.909 
human landmarks it was easy to
understand<00:02:58.840> all<00:02:59.169> the<00:02:59.349> different<00:02:59.379> floors

00:02:59.909 --> 00:02:59.919 
understand all the different floors

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:01.589 
understand all the different floors
basement<00:03:00.609> ceiling<00:03:00.939> and<00:03:01.209> everything<00:03:01.450> all

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
basement ceiling and everything all

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:02.819 
basement ceiling and everything all
together<00:03:01.750> playing<00:03:02.650> as<00:03:02.799> the

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
together playing as the

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.379 
together playing as the
counter-terrorist<00:03:03.639> on<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:03.879> house<00:03:04.030> level

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:04.389 
counter-terrorist on the house level

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:06.420 
counter-terrorist on the house level
felt<00:03:04.659> a<00:03:04.780> little<00:03:04.930> easier<00:03:05.500> I<00:03:05.739> felt<00:03:05.980> like<00:03:06.010> I<00:03:06.189> could

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
felt a little easier I felt like I could

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.740 
felt a little easier I felt like I could
get<00:03:06.639> in<00:03:06.790> there<00:03:06.969> before<00:03:07.329> they<00:03:07.419> could<00:03:07.480> really

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
get in there before they could really

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.559 
get in there before they could really
set<00:03:08.169> up<00:03:08.319> enough<00:03:08.590> traps<00:03:09.069> my<00:03:09.730> team<00:03:10.000> also<00:03:10.209> kept

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
set up enough traps my team also kept

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.390 
set up enough traps my team also kept
running<00:03:10.810> into<00:03:10.870> a<00:03:11.019> strange<00:03:11.469> glitch<00:03:11.950> when<00:03:12.219> I<00:03:12.280> was

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
running into a strange glitch when I was

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.039 
running into a strange glitch when I was
playing<00:03:12.489> as<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:12.760> counter<00:03:13.329> terrorists<00:03:13.840> on<00:03:13.930> the

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
playing as the counter terrorists on the

maps<00:03:31.060> a<00:03:31.269> lot<00:03:31.449> but<00:03:31.659> sometimes<00:03:32.049> they're<00:03:32.260> so

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
maps a lot but sometimes they're so

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.890 
maps a lot but sometimes they're so
symmetrical<00:03:33.190> and<00:03:33.400> so<00:03:33.790> well-constructed<00:03:34.299> that

it<00:03:34.989> just<00:03:35.169> feels<00:03:35.349> like<00:03:35.440> you're<00:03:35.650> running<00:03:35.829> around

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190

fix<00:03:50.799> and<00:03:51.129> sometimes<00:03:51.729> my<00:03:51.939> game<00:03:52.180> would<00:03:52.359> just

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
fix and sometimes my game would just

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.229 
fix and sometimes my game would just
randomly<00:03:52.840> end<00:03:53.349> or<00:03:53.859> kick<00:03:54.340> me<00:03:54.370> out<00:03:54.699> and<00:03:54.939> put<00:03:55.120> me

randomly end or kick me out and put me
in<00:03:55.299> another<00:03:55.359> game<00:03:55.840> that<00:03:56.049> was<00:03:56.139> ending<00:03:56.560> at<00:03:56.650> the

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
in another game that was ending at the

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.909 
in another game that was ending at the
same<00:03:57.099> time<00:03:57.459> this<00:03:58.239> is<00:03:58.299> again<00:03:59.049> an<00:03:59.259> alpha<00:03:59.709> so

00:03:59.909 --> 00:03:59.919 
same time this is again an alpha so

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:01.439 
same time this is again an alpha so
running<00:04:00.159> into<00:04:00.370> these<00:04:00.459> glitches<00:04:00.729> is<00:04:01.090> really

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:01.449 
running into these glitches is really

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:03.089 
running into these glitches is really
common<00:04:01.780> I<00:04:02.109> did<00:04:02.319> think<00:04:02.530> the<00:04:02.650> frame<00:04:02.889> rates

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
common I did think the frame rates

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:05.069 
common I did think the frame rates
stayed<00:04:03.370> great<00:04:03.609> most<00:04:03.849> of<00:04:03.970> time<00:04:04.120> 60<00:04:04.689> frames<00:04:04.959> a

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
stayed great most of time 60 frames a

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:06.629 
stayed great most of time 60 frames a
second<00:04:05.409> and<00:04:05.530> those<00:04:05.620> little<00:04:05.769> closed<00:04:06.189> indoor

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:06.639 
second and those little closed indoor

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:08.879 
second and those little closed indoor
fights<00:04:06.970> felt<00:04:07.389> good<00:04:07.720> although<00:04:08.169> I<00:04:08.199> still<00:04:08.379> think

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:08.889 
fights felt good although I still think

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:10.140 
fights felt good although I still think
they<00:04:09.009> need<00:04:09.189> to<00:04:09.280> tinker<00:04:09.639> with<00:04:09.669> it<00:04:09.819> a<00:04:09.970> little

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
they need to tinker with it a little

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.689 
they need to tinker with it a little
more<00:04:10.479> I<00:04:10.840> really<00:04:11.590> enjoyed<00:04:11.620> participating<00:04:12.099> in

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:12.699 
more I really enjoyed participating in

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:14.520 
more I really enjoyed participating in
this<00:04:12.819> closed<00:04:13.150> alpha<00:04:13.419> but<00:04:13.810> I'm<00:04:13.930> looking<00:04:14.259> even

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
this closed alpha but I'm looking even

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.770 
this closed alpha but I'm looking even
more<00:04:14.560> forward<00:04:15.159> to<00:04:15.340> the<00:04:15.459> closed<00:04:15.819> beta<00:04:16.209> because

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
more forward to the closed beta because

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.539 
more forward to the closed beta because
honestly<00:04:17.169> this<00:04:17.440> game<00:04:17.620> needs<00:04:17.829> a<00:04:17.979> little<00:04:18.280> bit

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
honestly this game needs a little bit

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.149 
honestly this game needs a little bit
more<00:04:18.789> work<00:04:19.090> before<00:04:19.389> it's<00:04:19.720> ready<00:04:19.930> to<00:04:20.109> go<00:04:20.169> thanks
