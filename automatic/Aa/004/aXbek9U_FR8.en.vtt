00:00:00.769 --> 00:00:06.400
 the Halloren welcome to 1 Zerbst I rate first and as now 

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:10.769
 For the first time games recognize but once again in the program and that for a long time 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.479
 will Kouchner 

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:17.050
 now it does not come to the same as 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.279
 Kollers Bleier Stern, that many times many many 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.060
 has tested many months 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.890
 to the 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.039
 Both organs are also relatively equal to Norbert Koll also burdensome is yet one 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:31.630
 kick 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.000
 better than cost to create older predecessors 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.660
 well, I do not know if it would be done after that but so that ICANN and the name 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.660
 looks and sounds a little bit more right away 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.860
 then of course you can first of all here in our photo ly per liter more 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.570
 Choose photos that we have already shot 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.190
 and to change it 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.770
 he could of course with the camera from the iPod or the iPhone 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.720
 or soon of the iPad percent, of course, change the photos and 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.420
 Percent Facebook is clearly the Belgian on your facebook account 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.400
 Photo collection 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.820
 upload or even order documents and to change them here I know 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.630
 not around now 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.910
 no idea what that is you can me 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.300
 in the video images India under the video write maybe you know what that 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.670
 is 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.799
 then of course there is the TCP - maybe that's of course 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:29.459
 Developers get the latest news about the pea or other EPS or others 

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:32.680
 Programs, however, I do not have that anymore 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:35.190
 say yes because I'm not really interested 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.880
 Then there were tips on how to see that too 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.079
 can not vary the pictures can change or who can work 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:46.670
 then a video of how it works 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.050
 in Denglisch another international match on power politics and 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.180
 of course that would be the context Duport is of course the developer contacts 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.650
 Access to the developers 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.000
 BC Petrolub action patch so be the homepage of developers and 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.150
 Of course, then the facebook fan world of the developers 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.010
 if I ever look at my photo Liberi around more of this photo here with 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.319
 Internals out 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.870
 and we see now that is loading and when it comes in, that will be 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.909
 black-and-white 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:22.209
 Banias is as uncertain as you are 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:24.179
 Nicholas Besch 

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:28.029
 because of comparison they always stay the two worlds 

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:31.569
 It's just a little bit the same ladies are a bit better 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.579
 it is now possible to set up a brush here you can fuel 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.790
 to go out or so to go out 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.440
 Hartmann brush or now the soft slope then you have here on the 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.630
 Back round before but always over it goes then you see that it is so 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.459
 continues to speak 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.629
 Of course, you can go back to Baldham and back to the top 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:53.409
 to undo or redo anything, however you like it 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:57.289
 Of course, there is still percent here and Swan 

00:02:57.289 --> 00:03:00.499
 with which one can erase everything again now of course that is again 

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:01.860
 make Beirut pure 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.560
 Tamara that we watch here and then we came with the Swabians everything 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.019
 paint again black and white but very discreet as you can see 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.849
 then, of course, you can zoom in again 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.089
 and then you can do it with two fingers 

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:16.749
 So here in the picture move 

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:20.439
 so now try the plate Ravel MA ne that one then there 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:21.329
 of course, the 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:22.559
 really hard 

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:26.300
 Schwabens is black and white again to erase everything 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.689
 so now we try again 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:31.689
 so far as possible to free the valley floodplains of theirs 

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:37.569
 and you can see that's fine, it's easy, you can relax with the 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.579
 Fingers here clear the whole trailer 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:43.599
 and now that's all went to the app 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:47.789
 So Dr around the basement is in fact blue 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:53.269
 we can see her and hard and then we go here on the alpine and 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:56.519
 can now turn on Koller again then we will see the picture will be 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:57.400
 roadway 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.449
 but here see percent of parts crack still believes 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:03.879
 now we can have the plate we are going to on this stage here 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:04.899
 and then 

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:09.859
 7 million and these conditions we see the trailer will be money or percent 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:10.869
 Red Green 

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:13.419
 then even teachers can do Roth 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:16.229
 and the world is threatening then it has changed him 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:19.819
 then we go back on it then we can still sound effect here 

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:20.709
 reinmachen 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.629
 If you want you can say that you see old rector of Juso 

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:27.629
 to the blue effect or such a green project way 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.960
 The thieves are a striking one, so far, they were under construction and now 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.529
 of course now 

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:37.749
 when the color makes one again 

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:39.580
 SID Marl 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.889
 Of course, bikes are all back 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:47.629
 and you can see here but now very light eavesdropping and so you can 

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:48.470
 that, of course 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.740
 ex-st work that really one thinks this is a blue percent is one 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:54.879
 red plate 

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:56.809
 I'll do that very briefly 

00:04:56.809 --> 00:04:58.169
 around 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:00.710
 That's easy as I said 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.490
 around a chair before you do it again 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.020
 Ahlers out of here 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.199
 you can leave it a bit discreet gutters so you can 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:11.939
 That's how the blue panther man always kept himself and everything 

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:16.169
 and then I go for example to the spray can and later a bit 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.099
 here is where 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:19.360
 is blue 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.520
 the blue now easily easy way 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.620
 and it's all perfect that is 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.650
 which by hand so I find the program 11 straight and I already have 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.029
 some changes in the market 

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:33.110
 I think 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.210
 properly ultrasound machines and so it is not difficult either 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.870
 and it works as I said some programs that has already tried the 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.389
 Plant works and percent the program works very well 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:48.300
 "It's a bit heavy in the stomach that's so Amann down from the BÃ¼lt and 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.499
 again 

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:50.370
 so 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.410
 I think so it is enough for me now out again and now the picture 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:56.860
 Farwick again 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.339
 where is the 4 

00:05:58.339 --> 00:06:02.369
 Pumas picture panic again and we see here so'n small blue edge of the 

00:06:02.369 --> 00:06:05.240
 Cologne with the spray can and the senior house 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.599
 retouch 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:09.599
 so that the whole village is gone 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.379
 and promptly 

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:17.669
 if he did not know that the trailer before Bluebeard then you would know 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:21.710
 so now that he's red but i know him now any color wanderlust me 

00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:23.199
 So I want to be able to do that here 

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:27.349
 it's really dark around here too 

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:29.559
 or so real dark wilder 

00:06:29.559 --> 00:06:32.629
 Of course the goal is quite unfair outside male because it is so 

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:33.889
 make a bit lighter 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:37.430
 then the whole thing already looks right now the plate is blue again 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.339
 as it was, it makes the dish green 

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:42.869
 or yellow years always weight so 

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:47.419
 and there and if it did not know then we would think the trailer is 

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:50.949
 Green so I would think so when I see the photo for the first time 

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:51.990
 yellow divider 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.300
 and then when we take the whole thing out of here again 

00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:59.179
 and put everything in the middle and the original form 

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:03.520
 looks almost the same 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.729
 Who is it APA Unia and comment 

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:12.939
 Tauss told Bernanke that I liked the video
