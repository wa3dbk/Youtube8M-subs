00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.910
 This is the shipping area and the part 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.720
 back where they see the network is the area of 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.680
 drone testing is packing 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.650
 I carefully get into a box and 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.610
 then send the production area 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.200
 to art 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.230
 then here is the whole assembly 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.720
 shallow good morning 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.880
 currently 3 of robotics has 150 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.280
 employees divided between berkeley 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.800
 california san diego california and 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.540
 tijuana baja california the company itself 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.370
 is dedicated to developing the system of 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.740
 control for drones 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.240
 it's basically the brain that gets 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.050
 inside of any type of aircraft and 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.580
 be a multi rotor or airplane helicopter and 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.950
 This allows you to fly in a way 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.950
 completely autonomous began in my 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.829
 garage practically 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.619
 a day that I had the need to 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.689
 try to stabilize my helicopter with 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.850
 accelerometers that I extracted from a nintendo 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.000
 wii and hacking today a little bit and some 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.619
 code I managed to do it not and with after 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.340
 a few years of development and 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.240
 I work to be investigating and 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.399
 developing I could 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.320
 now I do stabilize my first plane 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.570
 that led me to optionally create the 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.510
 first automatic code pilot 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:03.140
 open and low cost 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:05.810
 look here you know how he grabs 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.170
 component and puts it a little this has 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.820
 two heads you usually have a two 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.520
 heads is the advantage and then you will do two 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.440
 pieces and just take a trip the 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.140
 ovens have a profile of 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.240
 Super precise temperature that allows you 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.160
 melt the paste in fact right now what 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.890
 what are you doing during what you 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.530
 profiling flame puts a pcb with some 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.170
 components like with ones and they call 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.050
 temperature sensors to see if the 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.180
 profile is correct and some of the pcb 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.640
 is they occupy cleaning then the machine 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.280
 special another fifty fifty thousand 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.410
 Dollars 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.630
 basically between the fish and them 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.520
 I breathe a special liquid and take away 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.930
 all thanks the flux because the 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.630
 pasta releases a flux that makes it 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.770
 crystallize and cause short to all this 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.650
 areas what we call the area of 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.360
 testing is basically a soldier sign 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.250
 they are presided over by all 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.410
 procedures that must follow for 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.750
 make sure you are in tender all 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.760
 these lines are dedicated to drying them 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.560
 verify or weld what you have 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.020
 to weld or to wrap and 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.820
 send myself to the final client I'm 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.970
 surprised like today and thanks to 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:17.300
 internet the global collaboration achieves 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:20.200
 make integration of different products 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.700
 to create new things is not all a 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.500
 global ecosystem that has been created in 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.910
 in recent years the roots of the 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.400
 company was to create and develop 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.590
 technology more than anything prototypes in 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.709
 beta not currently the company has 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.810
 lost that then a way to 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.370
 going back to doing what I like most is 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.880
 create a new department that is called 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.620
 twitter ex is a unique department and 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.050
 exclusively to innovate new 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.660
 products and that we can market 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.860
 but more than anything focused on hackers 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.960
 professionals people who can 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.270
 use and that same technology can be 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.280
 recycle to create much more products 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.950
 which are integrated into the range of 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.370
 products that we have professionals from 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.260
 the company 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.320
 here it looks like they put for example the 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.540
 last product that is this iris is 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.220
 see how they start to assemble how 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.560
 do the parts as they should go 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.570
 engines propellers as it gives inside it 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.310
 they load code and actually fly it to 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.530
 see if it works very well this is the 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.390
 first thing we did is the simplest and 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.370
 It is very easy to repair the advantage of 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.010
 this one is that it's super-robust 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.900
 easy to repair and very cheap is a lot 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.310
 cheaper than the other one in fact and it's 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.260
 perfect to learn if you want 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.670
 learn is the perfect platform if 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.090
 for example it is one of the aircraft that 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:34.940
 we sell same very simple fire 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.980
 easy to repair cheap and this one has the 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.150
 ability to fly for 45 minutes an hour 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.010
 to turn it on for the battery that 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.010
 put and has front camera and video 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.110
 with a range of 34 miles or about 5 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.610
 or 6 kilometers we do not want it to be 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.710
 rocket because we do not want that either 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.010
 see like a thousand 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.870
 we want it to look neutral because then 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.610
 we have many problems in issues 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.850
 military mostly the other side in 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.670
 us perceive the drones as the ones the 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.350
 military throwing missiles and spies and 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.210
 the digital ones we are trying to 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.289
 change that 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.569
 that vision that they have 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:13.409
 when I got tired of throwing dirt on the cop 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:16.649
 but if you do not produce me for nothing if 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:18.599
 I saw it as well as it gave me sadness in 

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:21.240
 that moment that one wants to make you 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:22.969
 get ahead and good mexico 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.550
 unfortunately sometimes it is very difficult 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:28.279
 but hey can get ahead in the usa 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.969
 I did not give up and good 

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:31.680
 definitely the infrastructure in 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:33.779
 mind in the US is much easier for 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.430
 create but I think it 's important as 

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:36.529
 Mexican businessman always come back to 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.559
 your country 

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:42.940
 if it's a private plane drone and with 

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:46.250
 hardware 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:49.220
 that's what they have are those of those of 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:51.979
 try a test code create a 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.080
 tunnel of knowledge and experiences 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:55.610
 and more than anything the personality of the 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.610
 company itself and can be transmitted in 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:02.229
 mexico impregnate not that mentality the 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.229
 rest of the country is busy 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.960
 Y 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.330
 camera 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.540
 let's go back all the vehicles for 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.850
 make sure that the engines are in 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:22.430
 conditions that the configuration 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:25.940
 or the calibration that we did 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.380
 previously worked 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.650
 and is flying in good condition by 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.650
 so much 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:38.820
 example here the operator what he does is 

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:41.970
 see that we are not going towards a 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:45.530
 side because I have it without without levers and 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.530
 it's pretty stable, this is good 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:50.169
 we turn around we go we give ourselves 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:53.259
 tell if there is something strange if some engine 

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:55.599
 which is that we can detect some fault 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:57.980
 it is difficult but if it is detectable with 

00:06:55.599 --> 00:07:02.060
 good eye and 

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:03.830
 I heard or ice flies 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:08.770
 so we send it to the client so that 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:08.770
 it looks like new takes away all 

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:19.280
 no more 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:26.659
 I am currently seven years old 

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:29.060
 we invoiced 10 million dollars and the 

00:07:26.659 --> 00:07:31.370
 next year we are reading invoice the 

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:34.009
 double of an entire institution so 

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:39.340
 have patience and I say 99% 

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:39.340
 patience 1% intelligence
