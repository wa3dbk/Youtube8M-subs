hunted bullfrogs you shine a light in
their<00:02:49.170> eyes<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:49.650> that<00:02:49.740> paralyzes<00:02:50.430> them<00:02:50.550> so

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
their eyes and that paralyzes them so

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.810 
their eyes and that paralyzes them so
which<00:02:51.300> tape<00:02:51.810> these<00:02:52.340> flashlights<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.550> BB

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
which tape these flashlights to the BB

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.580 
which tape these flashlights to the BB
guns<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.300> you<00:02:54.420> could<00:02:54.540> literally<00:02:54.870> walk<00:02:55.020> right

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
guns and you could literally walk right

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.160 
guns and you could literally walk right
up<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:55.920> them<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:56.610> point<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.390> BB<00:02:57.660> gun<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.080> the

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
up to them and point the BB gun and the

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.500 
up to them and point the BB gun and the
flashlight<00:02:58.620> Adam<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.100> pop<00:02:59.280> them<00:02:59.460> but<00:03:00.420> the

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
flashlight Adam and pop them but the

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.060 
flashlight Adam and pop them but the
problem<00:03:00.840> is<00:03:00.990> when<00:03:01.470> you<00:03:01.620> pop<00:03:01.860> them<00:03:02.040> they<00:03:02.640> jump

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
problem is when you pop them they jump

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.590 
problem is when you pop them they jump
so<00:03:05.070> it's<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.250> catch-22<00:03:05.580> so<00:03:06.180> you're<00:03:06.300> trying<00:03:06.540> to

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
so it's a catch-22 so you're trying to

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.240 
so it's a catch-22 so you're trying to
catch<00:03:06.780> them<00:03:06.990> you're<00:03:07.380> trying<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:07.800> shoot<00:03:08.100> him

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
catch them you're trying to shoot him

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.390 
catch them you're trying to shoot him
and<00:03:08.400> then<00:03:09.110> anyway<00:03:10.110> so<00:03:10.170> long<00:03:10.530> story<00:03:10.800> short<00:03:11.070> we

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
and then anyway so long story short we

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.110 
and then anyway so long story short we
probably<00:03:11.730> bagged<00:03:12.390> 30<00:03:13.290> of<00:03:13.530> them<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:14.030> so<00:03:15.030> we

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
probably bagged 30 of them and so we

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.540 
probably bagged 30 of them and so we
went<00:03:15.240> down<00:03:15.390> in<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.570> kitchen<00:03:16.190> in<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.400> basement
