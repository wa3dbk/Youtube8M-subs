00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
anyway the problem is it's not the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.530 
anyway the problem is it's not the
easiest<00:01:19.860> thing<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.580> do<00:01:20.759> that's<00:01:21.270> where<00:01:21.450> the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
easiest thing to do that's where the

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.899 
easiest thing to do that's where the
geeks<00:01:21.750> from<00:01:22.020> MIT<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.590> Adobe<00:01:23.220> come<00:01:23.460> in<00:01:23.580> they

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
geeks from MIT and Adobe come in they

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.700 
geeks from MIT and Adobe come in they
teamed<00:01:24.180> up<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.570> figure<00:01:24.840> out<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:24.990> technique<00:01:25.560> they

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
teamed up to figure out a technique they

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.010 
teamed up to figure out a technique they
call<00:01:25.950> visual<00:01:26.580> honing<00:01:27.150> that'll<00:01:27.750> let<00:01:27.869> them

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
call visual honing that'll let them

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.810 
call visual honing that'll let them
compare<00:01:28.590> what<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.890> cameras<00:01:29.250> looking<00:01:29.369> at<00:01:29.670> two

compare what the cameras looking at two
other<00:01:29.970> photographs<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.840> gives<00:01:31.380> the
