 volunteer fire company. 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.110
 corupá 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.080
 an unusual fact an owl was 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.330
 found on the street and was brought here 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.480
 at the volunteer fire brigade 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.099
 commander 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.130

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:22.960
 They think it's full here lately 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.169
 has there been an incidence 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:29.200
 very large of injured animals that the 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.489
 population is coming here for the 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.250
 corporation 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:34.660
 along with that we also have a 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.970
 partnership with the environmental police 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:41.530
 joinville coming collect these animals 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:43.930
 does the wound treatment and makes the 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.730
 release again in their environment 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.590
 owl that she has any some kind of 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.480
 not her injury is with a wing 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.780
 well, that lady who 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.310
 found on the street told us that the 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.780
 same was broken kitchen us 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.070
 found that 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.079
 now we are waiting for the police 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.150
 environment to make delivery to 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.370
 undo her care commander 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.439
 perhaps even by an invasion of the population 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.270
 inhabitants to all animals but I see 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:09.159
 that the corporation receives enough of these 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.600
 animals is as it was animal more 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.040
 unusual animals in the states that 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.080
 firemen arrived here 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.690
 well here we have already taken several types of 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:21.100
 animals from small animals is like 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:24.120
 turtle graxaim the coach is come up 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.950
 receive a champion deer, then 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.750
 we did another there we were directed to a 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.220
 veterinarian but also did not survive 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.290
 who had a very serious injury 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.540
 so we do this kind of behavior 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.979
 people collect the material is a step 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.549
 Some little thing happens to the police. 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.290
 environmental 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:39.549
 finally commander put guidance 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.560
 of people watching our videos 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.400
 what to do when you find a bug 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.170
 syndication 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.700
 good actually trying to capture 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.710
 he is a person who does not have the 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.260
 knowledge can cause personal injury. 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.049
 so it's easier for you to do what 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.030
 you leave the door is open the window 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.909
 open watch it come out naturally 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.500
 If you do not go out there, you'll be the fireman. 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.060
 environmental police who have the 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.700
