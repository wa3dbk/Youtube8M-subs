00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.510
 secret to succeed the couscous then 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.489
 it's except that for people who do not have 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.410
 never made couscous or so to 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.960
 never replace them with water 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.149
 four spoonfuls of olive oil 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.760
 departure to open the troll and for 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.609
 that she does not know herself then there is 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.489
 how much of the ja 500 grams one is 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.780
 that yesterday and well full of oil 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.280
 olive 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.960
 we open the rails because it 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.530
 tumble 6 form it forms a lot 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.840
 less than with water that's all we're going to 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.930
 put now welcome the first 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.210
 crisis then one cooks in three times three 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.890
 time then what's important is 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.960
 to have absolutely false steam 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.409
 then you have to put the maximum and there 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.750
 saw the fear and poured the couscous 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.620
 directly to which the top part 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.350
 that was mixed up with the arrival 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:38.790
 distributed over the entire surface of the 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:41.790
 Couscoussier we open well and that's it 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.409
 that's hip and now so here we 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.000
 licking how much time like that then 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.380
 to not watch because it shows 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.450
 depends on your that this one depends on it 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.310
 of your water fire but the only guarantee 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.800
 that 's it to wait a few 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.710
 minutes a college the steam really 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.470
 cover everything how it goes in removes 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.220
 and this is the twelfth time ie 3 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.530
 4 minutes 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.100
 the seed is now poured into a 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.630
 great dish what you have on hand 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:13.709
 but it must be finally 7th 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:16.410
 rank and now we open and we go 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.780
 wet with water to make 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.360
 swell the seeds and toppling 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.959
 and back in and we're still waiting 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.150
 steam 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.430
 we wait for the steam to come out of 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.630
 everywhere you go everything is settled 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:33.030
 swell the seeds and no cutlery 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.250

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.590
 second time at the second time and is 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:43.590
 named in a dish the seeds get 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:49.110
 detach well and now we add a 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:52.260

 grams of couscous especially it takes 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:03.150
 stalk the balls and crush them 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.019

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.290
 the third 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.450

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.010
