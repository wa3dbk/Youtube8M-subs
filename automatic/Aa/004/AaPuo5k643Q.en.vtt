the background look like chainsaws yeah
I<00:01:18.410> pretty<00:01:18.650> much<00:01:18.740> point<00:01:19.100> that<00:01:19.220> at<00:01:19.369> the<00:01:19.520> moment<00:01:20.000> I

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
I pretty much point that at the moment I

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.850 
I pretty much point that at the moment I
start<00:01:20.810> this<00:01:20.990> stage<00:01:21.260> where<00:01:23.260> have<00:01:24.260> we<00:01:24.380> seen<00:01:24.410> Mets

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
start this stage where have we seen Mets

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.820 
start this stage where have we seen Mets
yet<00:01:25.100> is<00:01:25.250> that<00:01:25.430> the<00:01:25.550> first<00:01:25.580> one<00:01:26.030> in<00:01:26.150> this<00:01:26.270> game

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
yet is that the first one in this game

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.210 
yet is that the first one in this game
aha<00:01:27.830> I<00:01:27.979> think<00:01:28.220> that<00:01:28.340> has<00:01:28.430> been<00:01:28.640> the<00:01:28.700> first<00:01:28.910> one

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
aha I think that has been the first one

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.359 
aha I think that has been the first one
out<00:01:31.220> of<00:01:31.280> my<00:01:31.580> way<00:01:31.820> okay<00:01:33.010> and<00:01:34.010> there's<00:01:34.220> the

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
out of my way okay and there's the

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.490 
out of my way okay and there's the
second<00:01:34.670> one<00:01:34.790> I<00:01:34.820> always<00:01:34.970> fail<00:01:35.690> to<00:01:35.900> dodge<00:01:36.080> meds

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
second one I always fail to dodge meds

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.770 
second one I always fail to dodge meds
because<00:01:36.830> they're<00:01:37.160> the<00:01:37.190> most<00:01:37.460> basic<00:01:37.880> enemy<00:01:38.510> and

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
because they're the most basic enemy and

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.040 
because they're the most basic enemy and
therefore<00:01:39.260> I<00:01:39.290> must<00:01:39.500> get<00:01:39.710> killed<00:01:40.010> by<00:01:41.050> shagwell

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
therefore I must get killed by shagwell

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:48.180 
therefore I must get killed by shagwell

galaxy<00:06:03.340> man<00:06:03.490> during<00:06:03.700> it<00:06:04.050> yep<00:06:05.730> any<00:06:06.730> think<00:06:06.940> it's

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 
galaxy man during it yep any think it's

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.410 
galaxy man during it yep any think it's
more<00:06:07.210> like<00:06:07.360> mega<00:06:07.570> man<00:06:08.400> that's<00:06:09.400> true

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:10.420 
more like mega man that's true

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.750 
more like mega man that's true
open<00:06:11.260> beta<00:06:11.530> man<00:06:11.770> stops<00:06:12.130> once<00:06:12.430> he<00:06:12.520> touch<00:06:12.730> him

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:12.760
