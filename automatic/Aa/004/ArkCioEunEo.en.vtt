00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.469
 rondÃ³n 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:12.599
 6 hello before I start I want to thank you all the recipes that I 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.609
 you have finally deserved to make a version of the one that has 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:18.820
 proposed cristina dill 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.119
 to do we're going to need chicken breasts 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.099
 spinach a lot of the way and with 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.720
 The first thing to do is fillet 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.349
 the chicken breasts 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:34.450
 and we need customers to be very fine, worry us but be very skilled 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:37.620
 with the knife because this is sold and celebrated 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.450
 the truth that is a surprising recipe for the result because it is very easy and 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.990
 then it looks spectacular 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.990
 we put some spinach leaves 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
 and then a good piece of mozzarella 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.470
 gilroy act 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.640
 they look striped 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.640
 We do not cover with a slice of bacon icon 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:24.580
 if we think about it with a toothpick so that we do not get paid and we're going to put it in 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.149
 oven 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:30.360
 about 20 to 25 minutes to 200 degrees while we're going to make a sauce 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:34.820
 olive oil bouquets to heat enemies I'll go to retirees

 about 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.960
 and then we pepper 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.720

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.610
 p 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.570
 When the onion starts to become transparent, we add the few 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:03.990
 detached the poyo 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.849
 and we mix it well phipps 

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:11.219
 min 

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:16.209
 and now we're going to add a couple of tablespoons of jail and so on

 at once the vinasse cost 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.640
 we add a couple of escazÃº of chicken broth 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.619
 I'm going to explain how a quarter of a chicken has done a couple of carrots 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:37.939
 he was stealing a couple of reluctant 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:39.539
 a bay leaf 

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:41.889
 a few grains of pepper 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:44.239
 and a good squirt of olive oil 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.309
 b 

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:49.309
 let's see expressed 

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:55.939
 we turn to twelve and when the pressure gauge rises not 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:57.239
 we are five children 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.269
 once it has cooled we can cheat you also need a couple of 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.900
 cases for the plots we put the first and so we check the excess that 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.529
 we get 

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:13.439
 camps if we get one more and we mix it well 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.489

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.050

 p before serving remove from the hall 

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:34.789
