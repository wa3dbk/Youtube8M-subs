00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.789 

I've<00:00:01.469> often<00:00:01.709> been<00:00:02.340> asked<00:00:03.290> what<00:00:04.290> car<00:00:04.529> should<00:00:04.740> I

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
I've often been asked what car should I

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.820 
I've often been asked what car should I
get<00:00:04.859> next<00:00:05.220> East<00:00:06.060> this<00:00:06.299> car<00:00:06.540> worth<00:00:06.750> buying<00:00:07.080> is

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
get next East this car worth buying is

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.290 
get next East this car worth buying is
this<00:00:08.010> car<00:00:08.250> better<00:00:08.460> than<00:00:08.550> that<00:00:08.790> car

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
this car better than that car

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.440 
this car better than that car
so<00:00:09.990> what<00:00:10.230> decide<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.650> do<00:00:10.800> was<00:00:11.010> I've<00:00:11.610> compiled<00:00:12.210> a

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
so what decide to do was I've compiled a

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.440 
so what decide to do was I've compiled a
list<00:00:12.690> of<00:00:13.139> what<00:00:13.740> I<00:00:13.769> think<00:00:13.889> is<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.370> top<00:00:14.730> 20<00:00:15.179> cars

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
list of what I think is the top 20 cars

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.660 
list of what I think is the top 20 cars
in<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.780> game

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
in the game

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.029 
in the game
sometimes<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.960> there's<00:00:19.410> gonna<00:00:19.529> be<00:00:19.650> some<00:00:19.800> cars

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
sometimes the there's gonna be some cars

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.830 
sometimes the there's gonna be some cars
obviously<00:00:20.189> missed<00:00:20.850> down<00:00:21.090> out<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.449> them<00:00:21.630> a

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
obviously missed down out of them a

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.259 
obviously missed down out of them a
hundred<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.470> two<00:00:23.460> hundred<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.970> three<00:00:24.150> or

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
hundred and two hundred and three or

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.929 
hundred and two hundred and three or
whatever<00:00:24.510> we<00:00:24.660> are<00:00:24.689> up<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.199> at<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.320> moment

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
whatever we are up to at the moment

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:27.920 
whatever we are up to at the moment
they're<00:00:26.939> not<00:00:26.970> all<00:00:27.240> gonna<00:00:27.449> be<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:27.720> there

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
they're not all gonna be in there

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.800 
they're not all gonna be in there
there's<00:00:28.230> only<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.619> top<00:00:28.800> 20<00:00:29.189> well<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.490> think<00:00:29.779> on<00:00:30.779> a

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
there's only a top 20 well I think on a

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.150 
there's only a top 20 well I think on a
car<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.320> really<00:00:31.590> want<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.800> have<00:00:31.890> at<00:00:32.009> some

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
car that you really want to have at some

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.420 
car that you really want to have at some
point<00:00:33.020> I've<00:00:34.020> worked<00:00:34.290> them<00:00:34.500> out<00:00:34.590> on<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.920> basis

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
point I've worked them out on the basis

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.639 
point I've worked them out on the basis
of<00:00:35.610> if<00:00:36.210> there's<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.660> few<00:00:36.840> cars<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.469> are

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
of if there's a few cars that are

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.119 
of if there's a few cars that are
similar<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.700> each<00:00:38.850> other

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
similar to each other

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:42.020 
similar to each other
you<00:00:41.129> know<00:00:41.250> if<00:00:41.309> they<00:00:41.460> might<00:00:41.640> be<00:00:41.670> three<00:00:41.879> or<00:00:41.969> four

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
you know if they might be three or four

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.880 
you know if they might be three or four
cars<00:00:42.360> really<00:00:42.930> similar<00:00:43.170> in<00:00:43.290> stats<00:00:43.710> and

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
cars really similar in stats and

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.740 
cars really similar in stats and
everything<00:00:43.920> else<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:45.090> I've<00:00:45.210> only<00:00:45.360> probably

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
everything else and I've only probably

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.420 
everything else and I've only probably
picked<00:00:46.289> out<00:00:46.530> one<00:00:46.829> or<00:00:47.100> two<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.399> those<00:00:47.840> cars<00:00:49.430> and

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
picked out one or two of those cars and

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.360 
picked out one or two of those cars and
it<00:00:50.579> will<00:00:50.670> be<00:00:50.789> based<00:00:51.059> on<00:00:52.219> the<00:00:53.219> following

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
it will be based on the following

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.200 
it will be based on the following
criteria

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
criteria

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.020 
criteria
so<00:00:54.989> it's<00:00:55.110> move<00:00:55.260> based<00:00:55.469> on<00:00:55.649> value<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:56.910> it's

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
so it's move based on value so it's

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.939 
so it's move based on value so it's
going<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.180> be<00:00:57.300> how<00:00:57.989> much<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.379> car<00:00:58.590> obviously

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
going to be how much the car obviously

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.660 
going to be how much the car obviously
cost<00:00:59.489> you<00:01:00.109> the<00:01:01.109> versatility<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.039> car<00:01:02.280> so

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
cost you the versatility of the car so

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.579 
cost you the versatility of the car so
that's<00:01:02.789> obviously<00:01:03.000> going<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.359> be<00:01:03.420> if<00:01:04.290> you're

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
that's obviously going to be if you're

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.500 
that's obviously going to be if you're
going<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.860> be<00:01:04.949> using<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.400> car<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:05.939> online

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
going to be using that car on online

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.789 
going to be using that car on online
multiplayer<00:01:07.200> or<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:08.310> weekly<00:01:08.640> time<00:01:09.000> trials

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
multiplayer or the weekly time trials

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.490 
multiplayer or the weekly time trials
how<00:01:10.799> often<00:01:11.130> those<00:01:11.280> cars<00:01:12.020> come<00:01:13.020> up<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.350> those

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
how often those cars come up in those

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.280 
how often those cars come up in those
events<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.540> obviously<00:01:15.540> if<00:01:15.750> it's<00:01:15.900> going<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.080> be

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
events and obviously if it's going to be

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.460 
events and obviously if it's going to be
a<00:01:16.710> better<00:01:17.009> chance<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.460> winning<00:01:18.140> those<00:01:19.140> events

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
a better chance of winning those events

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.080 
a better chance of winning those events
because<00:01:19.740> quite<00:01:19.890> often<00:01:20.070> these<00:01:20.280> weekly<00:01:20.700> time

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
because quite often these weekly time

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.130 
because quite often these weekly time
trials<00:01:21.680> you<00:01:22.680> get<00:01:23.030> the<00:01:24.030> site<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.420> same<00:01:24.600> sort<00:01:25.080> of

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
trials you get the site the same sort of

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.010 
trials you get the site the same sort of
cars<00:01:25.500> come<00:01:25.770> up<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:26.130> lot<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.909> you'll<00:01:27.540> find<00:01:27.869> that

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
cars come up a lot and you'll find that

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.020 
cars come up a lot and you'll find that
certain<00:01:28.890> races<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.790> if<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.060> haven't<00:01:30.360> got

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
certain races that if you haven't got

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:38.630 
certain races that if you haven't got
Roberts<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.150> car<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:34.579> then<00:01:36.110> car<00:01:37.110> b<00:01:37.380> c<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.740> d<00:01:37.920> you

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
Roberts a car I then car b c and d you

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.429 
Roberts a car I then car b c and d you
know<00:01:38.759> then<00:01:39.000> once<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.390> they<00:01:39.509> never<00:01:39.750> win<00:01:39.960> it's

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
know then once and they never win it's

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.109 
know then once and they never win it's
always<00:01:40.920> car<00:01:41.220> right<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:41.729> that's<00:01:41.820> going<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.030> be

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
always car right so that's going to be

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.010 
always car right so that's going to be
one<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.450> deciding<00:01:43.020> factors<00:01:44.509> the<00:01:45.509> looks<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.869> the

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
one of deciding factors the looks of the

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.700 
one of deciding factors the looks of the
car<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.439> going<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.619> be<00:01:46.710> another<00:01:46.950> one<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:48.710> just

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
car is going to be another one so just

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.560 
car is going to be another one so just
out<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> look<00:01:50.159> in<00:01:50.310> general<00:01:50.460> not<00:01:51.030> just<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
out a look in general not just on the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.679 
out a look in general not just on the
choice<00:01:51.810> view<00:01:52.079> but<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.320> look<00:01:52.680> hood<00:01:53.369> view<00:01:53.689> what

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
choice view but a look hood view what

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.510 
choice view but a look hood view what
the<00:01:54.780> cockpits<00:01:55.290> like<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.979> sort<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.280> stuff

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
the cockpits like that sort of stuff

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.450 
the cockpits like that sort of stuff
just<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.180> know<00:01:57.270> there<00:01:57.420> looks<00:01:57.689> in<00:01:57.869> general

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
just it you know there looks in general

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.550 
just it you know there looks in general
obviously<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.790> big<00:02:00.570> big<00:02:00.810> thing<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.170> going<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.409> be

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
obviously a big big thing is going to be

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.170 
obviously a big big thing is going to be
how<00:02:01.860> they<00:02:02.040> drive<00:02:02.930> so<00:02:03.930> some<00:02:04.200> cars<00:02:04.439> may<00:02:04.649> well

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
how they drive so some cars may well

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.940 
how they drive so some cars may well
look<00:02:06.180> good<00:02:06.390> but<00:02:06.659> derive<00:02:06.930> terrible<00:02:07.500> or<00:02:07.680> the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
look good but derive terrible or the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.869 
look good but derive terrible or the
other<00:02:08.069> way<00:02:08.250> around<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:10.560> custom<00:02:11.069> options<00:02:11.670> so

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
other way around the custom options so

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.260 
other way around the custom options so
if<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.090> want<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.599> customize<00:02:13.560> these

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
if you want to customize these

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.480 
if you want to customize these
cause<00:02:14.470> some<00:02:15.470> are<00:02:15.650> definitely<00:02:16.040> better<00:02:16.400> than

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
cause some are definitely better than

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.900 
cause some are definitely better than
others<00:02:16.700> for<00:02:16.880> customization<00:02:18.910> opportunities

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
others for customization opportunities

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.300 
others for customization opportunities
there<00:02:20.150> so<00:02:20.390> if<00:02:20.480> you<00:02:20.570> wanna<00:02:20.860> you<00:02:21.860> know<00:02:21.890> if<00:02:22.070> you<00:02:22.160> do

I've worked some a scoring system out on
these<00:02:53.630> and<00:02:53.960> this<00:02:54.860> criteria<00:02:55.780> and<00:02:56.780> I've<00:02:56.960> then

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
these and this criteria and I've then

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.010 
these and this criteria and I've then
marked<00:02:57.530> them<00:02:57.710> at<00:02:58.640> a<00:02:58.700> ten<00:02:59.000> for<00:02:59.180> each<00:02:59.240> one<00:02:59.570> and

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
marked them at a ten for each one and

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.340 
marked them at a ten for each one and
that's<00:03:00.890> given<00:03:01.250> me<00:03:01.280> a<00:03:01.550> list<00:03:01.790> of<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.540> top<00:03:02.930> 20
