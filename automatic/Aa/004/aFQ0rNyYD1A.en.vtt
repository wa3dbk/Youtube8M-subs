YouTube<00:01:22.320> has<00:01:22.350> changed<00:01:22.470> in<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.830> manner<00:01:23.100> but

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
YouTube has changed in that manner but

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.560 
YouTube has changed in that manner but
another<00:01:25.200> thing<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.500> if<00:01:25.950> you're<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:27.270> reason

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
another thing is if you're the reason

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.660 
another thing is if you're the reason
that<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.930> am<00:01:28.229> unlucky<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:29.130> because<00:01:29.400> if<00:01:29.520> you're<00:01:29.640> a

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
that I am unlucky is because if you're a

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.090 
that I am unlucky is because if you're a
really<00:01:29.880> big<00:01:30.060> channel<00:01:30.420> then<00:01:31.259> you're<00:01:31.770> gonna<00:01:31.890> be

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
really big channel then you're gonna be

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.920 
really big channel then you're gonna be
able<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.310> be<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.850> related<00:01:33.210> video<00:01:33.450> sections

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
able to be in the related video sections

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.510 
able to be in the related video sections
and<00:01:34.200> people<00:01:34.860> will<00:01:34.950> find<00:01:35.159> your<00:01:35.250> videos<00:01:35.490> that

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
and people will find your videos that

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.160 
and people will find your videos that
way<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.119> it's<00:01:36.240> not<00:01:36.360> just<00:01:36.420> relying<00:01:36.930> on<00:01:37.049> the

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
way so it's not just relying on the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.230 
way so it's not just relying on the
subscriber<00:01:37.680> feed<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.700> subscription

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
subscriber feed and the subscription

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.410 
subscriber feed and the subscription
boxes<00:01:39.950> so<00:01:40.950> that's<00:01:41.189> why<00:01:41.340> they're<00:01:41.549> lucky<00:01:41.909> I'm

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
boxes so that's why they're lucky I'm

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.120 
boxes so that's why they're lucky I'm
not<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:42.780> lucky<00:01:42.810> with<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.140> because<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.890> don't

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
not so lucky with that because I don't

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.010 
not so lucky with that because I don't
have<00:01:44.280> as<00:01:44.460> big<00:01:44.610> as<00:01:45.090> bigger<00:01:45.299> channels<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.840> can

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
have as big as bigger channels that can

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
such good videos like yesterday I for

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.620 
such good videos like yesterday I for
about<00:02:01.140> 20<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.560> 20<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.600> searching<00:02:03.600> the

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
about 20 to 20 and to searching the

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.789 
about 20 to 20 and to searching the
story<00:02:03.899> match<00:02:04.020> which<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.320> thought<00:02:04.439> was<00:02:04.590> an

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
story match which I thought was an

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.069 
story match which I thought was an
insanely<00:02:05.250> good<00:02:05.490> video<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.719> takes<00:02:06.899> two

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
insanely good video and it takes two

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.779 
insanely good video and it takes two
hours<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.439> view<00:02:07.590> cap<00:02:07.799> it's<00:02:08.039> hard<00:02:08.310> for<00:02:08.459> me<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.670> do

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
hours to view cap it's hard for me to do

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.070 
hours to view cap it's hard for me to do
that<00:02:08.970> especially<00:02:09.179> when<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.569> have<00:02:09.720> such<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:09.899> big

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
that especially when I have such a big

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.339 
that especially when I have such a big
audience<00:02:11.360> it's<00:02:12.360> it's<00:02:12.750> kind<00:02:12.900> of<00:02:12.959> frustrating

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
audience it's it's kind of frustrating

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.850 
audience it's it's kind of frustrating
as<00:02:13.410> well

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
as well

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.360 
as well
so<00:02:14.900> it's<00:02:15.900> if<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:16.740> look<00:02:16.890> at<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.070> from<00:02:17.130> my<00:02:17.310> angle

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
so it's if you look at it from my angle

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.040 
so it's if you look at it from my angle
I<00:02:17.670> think<00:02:18.000> I'm<00:02:18.150> one<00:02:18.300> of<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.480> best<00:02:18.630> certain

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
I think I'm one of the best certain

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.990 
I think I'm one of the best certain
store<00:02:19.260> players

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.960 
store players
public<00:02:21.000> searching<00:02:21.270> store<00:02:21.480> players<00:02:21.720> out<00:02:21.870> there

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
public searching store players out there

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.920 
public searching store players out there
certainly<00:02:23.970> there<00:02:24.150> are<00:02:24.180> other<00:02:24.240> good<00:02:24.510> ones<00:02:24.600> but

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
certainly there are other good ones but

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.240 
certainly there are other good ones but
I<00:02:24.990> think<00:02:25.170> I'm<00:02:25.260> one<00:02:25.320> of<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.500> best<00:02:25.650> if<00:02:25.950> not<00:02:26.010> the

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
I think I'm one of the best if not the

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.390 
I think I'm one of the best if not the
best<00:02:26.700> in<00:02:27.180> my<00:02:27.300> opinion<00:02:27.800> I'll<00:02:28.800> tell<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.070> that<00:02:29.220> if

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.340 
available and you know that's just the
path<00:03:36.300> that<00:03:36.510> I'm<00:03:36.600> taking<00:03:36.930> I'm<00:03:37.050> starting<00:03:37.320> to

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
path that I'm taking I'm starting to

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.050 
path that I'm taking I'm starting to
realize<00:03:37.620> this<00:03:37.769> I've<00:03:38.220> always<00:03:38.580> held<00:03:38.790> this<00:03:38.910> as<00:03:39.030> a

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
realize this I've always held this as a

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.590 
realize this I've always held this as a
hobby<00:03:39.300> not<00:03:39.870> a<00:03:40.140> job<00:03:40.590> and<00:03:40.940> I<00:03:41.940> think<00:03:42.060> that's<00:03:42.330> good

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
hobby not a job and I think that's good

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.110 
hobby not a job and I think that's good
at<00:03:42.720> this<00:03:42.780> point<00:03:42.959> because<00:03:43.640> now<00:03:44.640> it's<00:03:44.850> not<00:03:44.970> gonna

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
at this point because now it's not gonna

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.900 
at this point because now it's not gonna
hurt<00:03:45.420> me<00:03:45.600> as<00:03:45.690> much<00:03:45.750> that<00:03:46.380> I'm<00:03:46.560> not<00:03:47.250> doing<00:03:47.610> it<00:03:47.730> as

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
hurt me as much that I'm not doing it as

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.190 
hurt me as much that I'm not doing it as
a<00:03:47.970> job<00:03:48.540> so<00:03:49.670> that's<00:03:50.670> that's<00:03:51.269> my<00:03:51.420> honest<00:03:52.050> take

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
a job so that's that's my honest take
