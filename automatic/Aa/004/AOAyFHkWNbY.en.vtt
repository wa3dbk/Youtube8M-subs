00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
most of the year so we'll get started by

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.049 
most of the year so we'll get started by
checking<00:00:40.950> out<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.219> West<00:00:41.399> stadium<00:00:41.760> Center

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
was actually being built and right here

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.040 
was actually being built and right here
in<00:00:52.860> front<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.370> have<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.579> live<00:00:53.879> representation<00:00:54.840> of

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
in front I have a live representation of

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.369 
in front I have a live representation of
Bill<00:00:55.320> Snyder<00:00:55.620> statue<00:00:55.949> which<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.610> actually<00:00:57.329> a

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
Bill Snyder statue which is actually a

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.990 
Bill Snyder statue which is actually a
villager<00:00:58.379> from<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.710> game<00:00:58.949> that's<00:00:59.280> encased<00:00:59.730> in

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
villager from the game that's encased in

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.270 
villager from the game that's encased in
glass<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.510> he's<00:01:00.600> wearing<00:01:00.780> purple<00:01:01.260> so<00:01:01.890> he<00:01:02.100> just

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
glass and he's wearing purple so he just

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.349 
glass and he's wearing purple so he just
keeps<00:01:02.399> an<00:01:02.579> eye<00:01:02.670> on<00:01:02.699> things<00:01:03.090> but<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.329> think

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
keeps an eye on things but I think

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.420 
keeps an eye on things but I think
that's<00:01:03.660> kind<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.899> funny<00:01:04.110> I'll<00:01:05.070> just<00:01:05.220> take<00:01:05.400> a

that's kind of funny I'll just take a
lap<00:01:05.700> around<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.210> whole<00:01:06.390> stadium<00:01:06.689> here<00:01:07.260> and

of the field I will let you know that it

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.510 
of the field I will let you know that it
is<00:01:27.689> very<00:01:28.049> difficult<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.829> actually<00:01:29.340> put

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
is very difficult to actually put

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.069 
is very difficult to actually put
together<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.850> decent-looking<00:01:30.360> power<00:01:30.780> cat

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
together a decent-looking power cat

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.800 
together a decent-looking power cat
using<00:01:31.500> just<00:01:31.710> blocks<00:01:32.220> but<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.970> was<00:01:33.540> able<00:01:33.659> to

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
using just blocks but I was able to

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.810 
using just blocks but I was able to
manage<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.560> just<00:01:34.770> by<00:01:35.159> making<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.610> little<00:01:35.640> bit

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
manage it just by making it a little bit

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.249 
manage it just by making it a little bit
bigger<00:01:36.119> than<00:01:36.360> what<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.659> would<00:01:36.780> actually<00:01:36.900> see

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
bigger than what you would actually see

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.109 
bigger than what you would actually see
in<00:01:37.320> real<00:01:37.380> life<00:01:37.710> but<00:01:38.040> there's<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.759> look<00:01:38.880> at<00:01:39.030> the

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
in real life but there's a look at the

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.330 
in real life but there's a look at the
field<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:40.020> other<00:01:40.049> side<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.159> west

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
stadium as well even though k-state

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.220 
stadium as well even though k-state
won't<00:02:10.709> do<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:11.099> for<00:02:11.160> another<00:02:11.819> year<00:02:12.060> or<00:02:12.120> so

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
won't do that for another year or so

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.870 
won't do that for another year or so
it's<00:02:13.440> I'll<00:02:13.800> move<00:02:13.980> around<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.490> other<00:02:14.610> side

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
it's I'll move around to the other side

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.339 
it's I'll move around to the other side
of<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.090> near<00:02:15.270> here<00:02:15.510> so<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:15.720> can<00:02:15.840> see<00:02:16.020> kind<00:02:16.319> of

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
of the near here so you can see kind of

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:23.350 
of the near here so you can see kind of
what<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.530> looks<00:02:16.680> like<00:02:17.040> from<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.580> other<00:02:17.610> side

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.630 

and<00:02:24.360> now<00:02:24.780> we'll<00:02:24.930> move<00:02:25.110> over<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:26.010> east<00:02:26.400> side

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
and now we'll move over to the east side

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.470 
and now we'll move over to the east side
of<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.940> stadium<00:02:28.190> so<00:02:29.190> this<00:02:29.819> is<00:02:29.970> what<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.239> looks

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
of the stadium so this is what it looks

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.910 
of the stadium so this is what it looks
like<00:02:30.720> from<00:02:31.580> this<00:02:32.580> angle<00:02:32.940> and<00:02:33.380> again<00:02:34.380> not<00:02:34.590> quite

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
like from this angle and again not quite

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.820 
like from this angle and again not quite
as<00:02:35.300> beautiful<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.390> look<00:02:36.540> at<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:36.810> guess<00:02:37.170> as<00:02:37.530> the

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
as beautiful to look at I guess as the

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.940 
as beautiful to look at I guess as the
west<00:02:38.190> side<00:02:38.430> but<00:02:38.760> it's<00:02:38.880> a<00:02:38.970> little<00:02:39.120> bit<00:02:39.330> older

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
west side but it's a little bit older

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.140 
west side but it's a little bit older
still<00:02:40.950> turned<00:02:41.459> out<00:02:41.640> fairly<00:02:42.209> nice<00:02:42.540> I<00:02:42.780> think<00:02:42.840> and

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
still turned out fairly nice I think and

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.520 
still turned out fairly nice I think and
further<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:45.569> the<00:02:45.660> south<00:02:45.900> here<00:02:46.260> is<00:02:46.410> the

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
they'd built a couple of years ago I

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.580

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
see venir from here because the game

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.940 
see venir from here because the game
just<00:03:44.430> doesn't<00:03:44.549> render<00:03:45.120> out<00:03:45.299> that<00:03:45.540> far<00:03:45.950> but

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
just doesn't render out that far but

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.630

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
was able to use two different kinds of

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.750 
was able to use two different kinds of
wood<00:03:55.019> to<00:03:55.260> make<00:03:55.290> it<00:03:55.560> look<00:03:55.739> more<00:03:56.100> realistic<00:03:56.430> with

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
wood to make it look more realistic with

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.270 
wood to make it look more realistic with
the<00:03:56.819> two<00:03:57.090> toned<00:03:57.390> thing<00:03:57.950> but<00:03:58.950> it's<00:03:59.069> kind<00:03:59.250> of

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
the two toned thing but it's kind of

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.340 
the two toned thing but it's kind of
hard<00:03:59.340> to<00:03:59.640> make<00:04:00.239> it<00:04:00.299> look<00:04:00.420> very<00:04:00.900> realistic

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
hard to make it look very realistic

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.289

going way up high here you can see what
the<00:05:18.930> stadium<00:05:19.350> kind<00:05:19.590> of<00:05:19.680> looks<00:05:19.860> like<00:05:19.950> when<00:05:20.340> the

like<00:05:39.810> I'd<00:05:39.960> assume<00:05:40.260> it<00:05:40.410> is<00:05:40.500> in<00:05:40.710> real<00:05:40.890> life<00:05:40.920> but<00:05:41.460> I

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
like I'd assume it is in real life but I

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.460 
like I'd assume it is in real life but I
really<00:05:42.000> don't<00:05:42.420> know<00:05:42.600> because<00:05:42.750> that's<00:05:42.960> again<00:05:43.440> a

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
really don't know because that's again a

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.650 
really don't know because that's again a
part<00:05:43.770> of<00:05:43.860> the<00:05:44.190> venire<00:05:44.610> complex<00:05:45.120> that<00:05:45.300> actually

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
part of the venire complex that actually

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.640 
part of the venire complex that actually
hasn't<00:05:45.870> technically<00:05:46.560> been<00:05:46.830> completed<00:05:47.310> yet

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
hasn't technically been completed yet

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.650 
hasn't technically been completed yet
but<00:05:49.650> we'll<00:05:50.130> go<00:05:50.250> back<00:05:50.490> around<00:05:50.670> to<00:05:51.000> the<00:05:51.120> K<00:05:51.300> State

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
but we'll go back around to the K State

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.970 
but we'll go back around to the K State
tunnel<00:05:52.140> and<00:05:52.800> I<00:05:53.370> did<00:05:53.640> take<00:05:54.500> time<00:05:55.500> and<00:05:55.710> attention

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:55.980 
tunnel and I did take time and attention

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.040 
tunnel and I did take time and attention
to<00:05:56.310> do<00:05:56.550> this<00:05:56.760> exactly<00:05:57.450> like<00:05:57.690> the<00:05:57.840> real<00:05:58.020> thing

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
to do this exactly like the real thing

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.780 
to do this exactly like the real thing
or<00:05:58.470> at<00:05:58.530> least<00:05:58.560> as<00:05:58.800> close<00:05:58.830> as<00:05:59.160> I<00:05:59.280> could<00:05:59.340> so

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 
or at least as close as I could so

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.600 
or at least as close as I could so
you'll<00:06:00.360> see<00:06:00.570> 16<00:06:01.110> pillars<00:06:01.470> that<00:06:01.950> are<00:06:02.190> in<00:06:02.400> here

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
you'll see 16 pillars that are in here

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.610 
you'll see 16 pillars that are in here
there's<00:06:02.790> eight<00:06:03.000> on<00:06:03.120> each<00:06:03.270> side<00:06:03.600> and<00:06:03.930> those

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
there's eight on each side and those

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.010 
there's eight on each side and those
actually<00:06:04.890> exist<00:06:05.520> and<00:06:05.760> they<00:06:05.850> stand<00:06:06.180> for<00:06:06.330> Bill

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
actually exist and they stand for Bill

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.160 
actually exist and they stand for Bill
Snyder<00:06:07.290> 16<00:06:07.830> goals<00:06:08.070> for<00:06:08.430> success<00:06:08.820> I<00:06:09.420> think

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:10.170 
Snyder 16 goals for success I think

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:11.750 
Snyder 16 goals for success I think
that's<00:06:10.320> kind<00:06:10.500> of<00:06:10.530> a<00:06:10.650> neat<00:06:10.800> touch<00:06:10.980> that<00:06:11.310> k-state

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760 
that's kind of a neat touch that k-state

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.750 
that's kind of a neat touch that k-state
added<00:06:12.180> to<00:06:12.300> the<00:06:12.420> new<00:06:12.540> complex<00:06:12.960> and<00:06:13.580> here's<00:06:14.580> K

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:14.760 
added to the new complex and here's K

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.480 
added to the new complex and here's K
State's<00:06:15.030> locker<00:06:15.300> room<00:06:15.630> and<00:06:15.980> again<00:06:16.980> this<00:06:17.370> is

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 
State's locker room and again this is

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.100 
State's locker room and again this is
pretty<00:06:17.670> much<00:06:17.760> exactly<00:06:17.880> what<00:06:18.360> the<00:06:18.570> real<00:06:18.720> one<00:06:18.960> is

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.110 
pretty much exactly what the real one is

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:20.780 
pretty much exactly what the real one is
supposed<00:06:19.440> to<00:06:19.530> look<00:06:19.740> like<00:06:19.800> when<00:06:20.160> it's<00:06:20.310> finished

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:20.790 
supposed to look like when it's finished

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.570 
supposed to look like when it's finished
I<00:06:21.050> think<00:06:22.050> that<00:06:22.230> this<00:06:22.530> part<00:06:22.800> of<00:06:22.980> the<00:06:23.370> stadium

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
I think that this part of the stadium

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.010 
I think that this part of the stadium
really<00:06:23.940> turned<00:06:24.120> out<00:06:24.270> nice

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 
really turned out nice

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.930 
really turned out nice
a<00:06:25.050> lot<00:06:25.350> of<00:06:25.380> purples<00:06:25.860> some<00:06:26.160> cool<00:06:26.340> lighting<00:06:26.700> in

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 
a lot of purples some cool lighting in

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.760 
a lot of purples some cool lighting in
here<00:06:26.970> you<00:06:27.360> can<00:06:27.510> see<00:06:27.660> nameplates<00:06:28.230> above<00:06:28.560> all

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:28.770 
here you can see nameplates above all

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.200 
here you can see nameplates above all
the<00:06:28.920> locker

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.060 

I<00:06:31.240> had<00:06:31.600> fun<00:06:31.810> working<00:06:32.020> on<00:06:32.290> this<00:06:32.770> particular

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.070 
I had fun working on this particular

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:37.230 
I had fun working on this particular
part<00:06:34.800> and<00:06:35.800> there's<00:06:36.280> one<00:06:36.460> more<00:06:36.640> thing<00:06:36.700> to<00:06:37.060> check

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 
part and there's one more thing to check

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.430 
part and there's one more thing to check
out<00:06:37.450> you<00:06:37.660> may<00:06:37.810> have<00:06:37.930> noticed<00:06:38.290> at<00:06:38.410> the

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:38.440 
out you may have noticed at the

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.890 
out you may have noticed at the
beginning<00:06:38.830> of<00:06:38.920> the<00:06:39.010> video<00:06:39.510> that<00:06:40.510> there<00:06:40.660> was<00:06:40.870> a

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:40.900 
beginning of the video that there was a

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.060 
beginning of the video that there was a
lever<00:06:41.470> in<00:06:41.800> the<00:06:42.100> parking<00:06:42.490> lot<00:06:42.670> and<00:06:43.950> we're<00:06:44.950> gonna

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:45.070 
lever in the parking lot and we're gonna

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:49.260 
lever in the parking lot and we're gonna
go<00:06:45.280> up<00:06:45.580> and<00:06:45.790> check<00:06:45.880> that<00:06:46.240> out<00:06:46.300> now<00:06:46.890> and<00:06:48.270> there

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.270 
go up and check that out now and there

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.350 
go up and check that out now and there
it<00:06:49.390> is<00:06:49.510> and<00:06:49.930> that's<00:06:50.740> there's<00:06:51.190> a<00:06:51.250> reason<00:06:52.240> that

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:52.360 
it is and that's there's a reason that

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.960 
it is and that's there's a reason that
that<00:06:52.510> lever<00:06:53.020> was<00:06:53.350> put<00:06:53.620> there<00:06:53.860> let<00:06:54.220> me<00:06:54.250> press<00:06:54.790> it

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:54.970 
that lever was put there let me press it

00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:02.730 
that lever was put there let me press it
or<00:06:55.060> I'll<00:06:55.180> show<00:06:55.360> you<00:06:55.450> what<00:06:55.600> it<00:06:55.690> does<00:07:01.590> so<00:07:02.590> that's

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:02.740 
or I'll show you what it does so that's

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.400 
or I'll show you what it does so that's
about<00:07:02.920> it<00:07:03.070> I<00:07:03.220> had<00:07:03.520> to<00:07:03.550> add<00:07:04.210> add<00:07:05.140> those

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:05.410 
about it I had to add add those

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:07.050 
about it I had to add add those
fireworks<00:07:05.890> in<00:07:06.190> there<00:07:06.400> there<00:07:06.580> were<00:07:06.670> a<00:07:06.730> bunch<00:07:06.880> of

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:07.060 
fireworks in there there were a bunch of

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.280 
fireworks in there there were a bunch of
circuits<00:07:07.480> and<00:07:07.630> things<00:07:07.840> that<00:07:07.960> I<00:07:08.080> had<00:07:08.200> to

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:08.290 
circuits and things that I had to

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:10.110 
circuits and things that I had to
complete<00:07:08.650> to<00:07:08.830> make<00:07:08.860> that<00:07:09.160> happen<00:07:09.460> to<00:07:09.850> make<00:07:09.940> him

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.120 
complete to make that happen to make him

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.120 
complete to make that happen to make him
come<00:07:10.300> through<00:07:10.330> the<00:07:10.720> top<00:07:11.380> of<00:07:11.440> the<00:07:11.590> West<00:07:11.770> stadium

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:12.130 
come through the top of the West stadium

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.830 
come through the top of the West stadium
Center<00:07:12.460> but<00:07:12.670> decided<00:07:13.090> to<00:07:13.150> add<00:07:13.240> it<00:07:13.270> that<00:07:13.480> in

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:13.840 
Center but decided to add it that in

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.920 
Center but decided to add it that in
there<00:07:13.990> as<00:07:14.110> well<00:07:14.320> so<00:07:14.760> well<00:07:15.760> again<00:07:16.090> I've<00:07:16.540> I've

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:20.920 
earned the Teferi nerdy connotation from

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.740 
earned the Teferi nerdy connotation from
this<00:07:21.100> but<00:07:21.370> that's<00:07:22.000> alright<00:07:22.330> and<00:07:22.510> that's<00:07:22.630> about

it
this<00:07:23.380> was<00:07:23.560> a<00:07:23.590> long<00:07:23.830> project<00:07:24.400> it<00:07:24.520> took<00:07:24.700> over

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:25.920 
this was a long project it took over

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.320 
this was a long project it took over
300,000<00:07:26.920> blocks<00:07:27.160> actually<00:07:27.550> to<00:07:27.850> complete<00:07:28.150> this

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:28.330 
300,000 blocks actually to complete this

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:29.750 
300,000 blocks actually to complete this
but<00:07:28.570> I<00:07:28.600> did<00:07:28.780> have<00:07:28.900> a<00:07:28.960> lot<00:07:29.110> of<00:07:29.200> fun<00:07:29.380> with<00:07:29.530> it

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:29.760 
but I did have a lot of fun with it

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.340 
but I did have a lot of fun with it
thanks<00:07:30.760> for<00:07:30.880> watching<00:07:31.240> and<00:07:31.420> I<00:07:31.480> I'm<00:07:32.140> looking
