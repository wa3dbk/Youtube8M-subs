the concept stage to help us sort of

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.960 
the concept stage to help us sort of
design<00:01:24.110> some<00:01:24.380> of<00:01:24.440> the<00:01:24.530> mechanics<00:01:24.980> and<00:01:25.160> then<00:01:25.670> I

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
design some of the mechanics and then I

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.940 
design some of the mechanics and then I
took<00:01:26.300> that<00:01:26.570> through<00:01:26.780> development<00:01:27.290> starts<00:01:27.830> off

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
took that through development starts off

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.680 
took that through development starts off
just<00:01:27.980> placeholder<00:01:28.790> maybe<00:01:29.090> getting<00:01:29.540> one

just placeholder maybe getting one
mechanic<00:01:30.110> down<00:01:30.229> and<00:01:30.590> then<00:01:30.710> we'll<00:01:30.800> go<00:01:30.860> and<00:01:31.070> play

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
mechanic down and then we'll go and play

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
afterwards and decide what worked what

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.690 
afterwards and decide what worked what
didn't<00:01:35.570> and<00:01:35.630> see<00:01:36.229> if<00:01:36.740> balanced<00:01:37.250> numbers<00:01:37.550> need
