for<00:01:58.590> ducks<00:01:58.920> as<00:01:59.219> they<00:01:59.490> take<00:01:59.759> off<00:01:59.969> or<00:02:00.299> are<00:02:00.450> seen

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
for ducks as they take off or are seen

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.440 
for ducks as they take off or are seen
in<00:02:00.719> flight<00:02:01.140> can<00:02:01.500> be<00:02:01.530> very<00:02:01.890> useful<00:02:02.340> on<00:02:02.549> the

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
in flight can be very useful on the

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.690 
in flight can be very useful on the
water<00:02:03.770> then<00:02:04.770> we<00:02:04.979> can<00:02:05.159> look<00:02:05.310> for<00:02:05.369> other

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
water then we can look for other

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.789 
water then we can look for other
patterns<00:02:06.270> for<00:02:06.479> example<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:07.079> mallard<00:02:07.530> duck

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
patterns for example the mallard duck

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.490 
patterns for example the mallard duck
has<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.459> dark<00:02:08.879> green<00:02:09.239> head<00:02:09.629> with<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.229> very

has a dark green head with a very

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.040 
has a dark green head with a very
prominent<00:02:10.979> white<00:02:11.340> ring<00:02:11.700> around<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:12.209> neck

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
prominent white ring around the neck

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.230 
prominent white ring around the neck
in<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.440> case<00:02:13.650> of<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:13.980> Canada<00:02:14.400> geese<00:02:14.640> behind

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
in the case of the Canada geese behind

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.480 
in the case of the Canada geese behind
me<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:15.660> looks<00:02:16.290> like<00:02:16.500> somebody<00:02:16.890> has<00:02:17.130> pulled<00:02:17.370> a

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
me it looks like somebody has pulled a

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.940 
me it looks like somebody has pulled a
black<00:02:17.730> stocking<00:02:18.450> over<00:02:18.780> their<00:02:18.930> neck<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:19.470> then

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
black stocking over their neck and then

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.550 
black stocking over their neck and then
given<00:02:20.310> them<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.550> white<00:02:20.910> chinstrap<00:02:21.900> a<00:02:22.170> very

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
given them a white chinstrap a very

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.380 
given them a white chinstrap a very
distinctive<00:02:23.100> combination<00:02:23.820> of<00:02:23.970> features<00:02:24.180> that

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
distinctive combination of features that

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.350 
distinctive combination of features that
readily<00:02:25.200> distinguishes<00:02:25.920> Canada<00:02:26.370> geese<00:02:26.580> in

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
readily distinguishes Canada geese in

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.410 
readily distinguishes Canada geese in
some<00:02:28.050> of<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.230> other<00:02:28.410> waterfowl<00:02:29.420> it's

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
some of the other waterfowl it's

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.630 
some of the other waterfowl it's
important<00:02:30.960> to<00:02:31.020> recognize<00:02:31.530> that<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:32.370> males

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
important to recognize that the males

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.360 
important to recognize that the males
and<00:02:32.970> females<00:02:33.450> look<00:02:33.720> different<00:02:34.200> in<00:02:34.380> geese<00:02:35.040> for

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
and females look different in geese for

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.070 
and females look different in geese for
example<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:35.910> in<00:02:36.030> swans<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.690> males<00:02:36.900> and

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
example and in swans the males and

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.380 
example and in swans the males and
females<00:02:37.470> are<00:02:37.620> essentially<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.310> same<00:02:38.520> but<00:02:39.300> in

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
females are essentially the same but in

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.240 
females are essentially the same but in
many<00:02:39.570> duck<00:02:39.840> species<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.530> females<00:02:40.740> are

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
many duck species the females are

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.700 
many duck species the females are
oftentimes<00:02:41.850> considerably<00:02:42.570> less<00:02:42.930> distinctive

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
oftentimes considerably less distinctive

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.130 
oftentimes considerably less distinctive
typically<00:02:44.670> being<00:02:44.880> more<00:02:45.180> Brown<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.780> modeled

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
typically being more Brown and modeled

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.320 
typically being more Brown and modeled
in<00:02:46.260> their<00:02:46.410> plumage<00:02:46.830> so<00:02:47.340> in<00:02:47.490> some<00:02:47.700> cases<00:02:47.910> you

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
in their plumage so in some cases you

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.330 
in their plumage so in some cases you
can<00:02:48.540> determine<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.170> sex<00:02:49.710> of<00:02:49.890> a<00:02:50.010> particular

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
can determine the sex of a particular

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.850 
can determine the sex of a particular
female<00:02:51.330> duck<00:02:51.570> by<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:51.930> company<00:02:52.440> that<00:02:52.650> she's

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
female duck by the company that she's

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.100 
female duck by the company that she's
keeping<00:02:53.160> because<00:02:53.490> oftentimes<00:02:54.060> you'll<00:02:55.020> see

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
keeping because oftentimes you'll see

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.140 
keeping because oftentimes you'll see
pairs<00:02:55.620> of<00:02:55.830> ducks<00:02:56.070> together<00:02:56.460> and<00:02:56.730> you<00:02:56.790> can<00:02:56.970> sort

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
pairs of ducks together and you can sort

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.990 
pairs of ducks together and you can sort
of<00:02:57.270> deduce<00:02:57.570> that<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:57.990> female<00:02:58.430> is<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.790> brown
