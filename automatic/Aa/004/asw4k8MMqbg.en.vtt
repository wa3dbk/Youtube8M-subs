00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
dollars that first of all and you can

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.490 
dollars that first of all and you can
probably<00:00:20.609> tell<00:00:20.760> already<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.390> actually<00:00:22.109> opened

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
have wrapping around most of the stuff

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.650 
have wrapping around most of the stuff
that<00:00:29.119> shouldn't<00:00:30.119> make<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.300> difference<00:00:31.759> so<00:00:32.759> well

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
that shouldn't make a difference so well

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.380 
that shouldn't make a difference so well

copy yeah collecting our cards and the
device<00:00:51.210> man<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:53.449> basically<00:00:54.449> yeah<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:57.710> just

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
device man you basically yeah and just

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.490 
device man you basically yeah and just
can<00:00:58.859> open<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.219> without<00:00:59.940> breaking<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:03.170> comes<00:01:04.170> in

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
can open it without breaking it comes in

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.300 
can open it without breaking it comes in
a<00:01:04.530> metal<00:01:04.979> case<00:01:06.530> proved<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.680> actually<00:01:08.100> says

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
a metal case proved it actually says

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.520 
a metal case proved it actually says
there<00:01:11.540> yeah<00:01:12.540> it's<00:01:12.869> got<00:01:12.990> interception

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
there yeah it's got interception

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.480 
there yeah it's got interception
indented<00:01:14.040> into<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:15.140> metal<00:01:16.310> think<00:01:17.310> that's

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
indented into the metal think that's

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.149 
indented into the metal think that's
metal<00:01:18.200> then<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.290> feel<00:01:19.530> like<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.890> oh<00:01:21.890> it's<00:01:22.890> open

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
metal then I feel like it oh it's open

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.249 
metal then I feel like it oh it's open
it<00:01:25.100> doesn't<00:01:26.100> open<00:01:26.340> all<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.299> way<00:01:27.420> out<00:01:27.450> just

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
it doesn't open all the way out just

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
but it's cool little thing to have a

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.810 
but it's cool little thing to have a
little<00:02:44.660> read<00:02:45.280> they've<00:02:46.280> really<00:02:46.310> put<00:02:46.670> some

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
little read they've really put some

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.750 
little read they've really put some
effort<00:02:46.940> into<00:02:47.210> it<00:02:47.590> so<00:02:48.590> it's<00:02:49.280> definitely<00:02:49.610> worth

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
effort into it so it's definitely worth

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.930 
effort into it so it's definitely worth
reading<00:02:50.060> and<00:02:52.780> you<00:02:53.780> get<00:02:53.900> a<00:02:53.930> spinning<00:02:54.320> top<00:02:54.940> some

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
reading and you get a spinning top some

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.850 
reading and you get a spinning top some
metal<00:02:56.060> as<00:02:56.390> well<00:02:56.570> it's<00:02:57.410> got<00:02:57.530> inception

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
metal as well it's got inception

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.960 
metal as well it's got inception
indented<00:02:58.790> into<00:02:59.060> that<00:03:00.340> you<00:03:01.340> all<00:03:01.490> know<00:03:01.670> what<00:03:01.910> a

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
indented into that you all know what a

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.840 
indented into that you all know what a
spinning<00:03:02.300> top<00:03:02.330> does<00:03:02.750> so<00:03:03.170> i<00:03:03.500> think<00:03:04.459> i<00:03:04.670> have<00:03:04.760> to

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
spinning top does so i think i have to

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.710 
spinning top does so i think i have to
demonstrate<00:03:05.030> it<00:03:05.510> and<00:03:07.060> before<00:03:08.060> i<00:03:08.239> show<00:03:08.480> you<00:03:08.510> the

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
demonstrate it and before i show you the

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.270 
demonstrate it and before i show you the
blu-ray<00:03:09.760> strangely<00:03:10.760> enough<00:03:10.820> you've<00:03:11.060> got<00:03:11.209> this

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
blu-ray strangely enough you've got this

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.310 
blu-ray strangely enough you've got this
the<00:03:13.280> numbers<00:03:13.640> that<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:14.630> code<00:03:14.840> that<00:03:15.170> was<00:03:15.260> used

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
the numbers that the code that was used

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.000 
Gavin go blu-ray player so yeah that's
pretty<00:04:16.110> much<00:04:16.530> it<00:04:16.680> what<00:04:17.670> you<00:04:17.760> get<00:04:18.800> it's<00:04:19.800> quite

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
pretty much it what you get it's quite

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.100 
pretty much it what you get it's quite
expensive<00:04:20.250> but<00:04:20.880> then<00:04:21.450> again<00:04:21.570> I<00:04:21.750> supposed

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.110 
expensive but then again I supposed

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.910 
expensive but then again I supposed
blu-ray<00:04:22.650> is<00:04:23.460> really<00:04:24.120> expensive<00:04:24.740> it's<00:04:25.740> what

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
blu-ray is really expensive it's what

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.530 
blu-ray is really expensive it's what
makes<00:04:26.100> up<00:04:26.460> most<00:04:26.700> of<00:04:26.910> it<00:04:27.860> so<00:04:29.270> you<00:04:30.270> know<00:04:30.330> i<00:04:30.420> think

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
makes up most of it so you know i think

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.410 
makes up most of it so you know i think
i've<00:04:30.810> got<00:04:30.990> anything<00:04:31.050> else<00:04:31.530> to<00:04:31.740> add<00:04:31.890> to<00:04:31.950> that

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
i've got anything else to add to that

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.600 
i've got anything else to add to that
it's<00:04:33.420> only<00:04:33.630> a<00:04:33.690> quick<00:04:33.930> unboxing<00:04:34.130> so<00:04:35.130> if<00:04:35.550> you

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610
