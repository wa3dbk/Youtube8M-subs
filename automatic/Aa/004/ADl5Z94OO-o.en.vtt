and<00:00:26.099> one<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.150> reasons<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.930> because<00:00:27.960> I'm

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
and one of the reasons is because I'm

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.210

back over here this is just a real quick

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.760 
back over here this is just a real quick
mock<00:04:39.550> setup<00:04:40.150> of<00:04:41.020> what<00:04:41.350> it's<00:04:41.530> going<00:04:41.560> to<00:04:41.680> look

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
mock setup of what it's going to look

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.880 
mock setup of what it's going to look
like<00:04:41.860> in<00:04:42.160> the<00:04:42.250> new<00:04:42.370> game<00:04:42.640> room<00:04:43.380> the<00:04:44.380> monitor<00:04:44.620> of

like in the new game room the monitor of

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.460 
like in the new game room the monitor of
course<00:04:45.070> is<00:04:45.190> not<00:04:45.340> going<00:04:45.430> to<00:04:45.490> be<00:04:45.610> on<00:04:45.700> the<00:04:45.790> table

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
course is not going to be on the table

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.230 
course is not going to be on the table
the<00:04:47.470> monitor<00:04:47.890> will<00:04:48.010> actually<00:04:48.340> be<00:04:48.460> bolted<00:04:49.000> to

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
the monitor will actually be bolted to

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.820 
the monitor will actually be bolted to
the<00:04:49.270> wall<00:04:49.420> and<00:04:51.840> this<00:04:52.840> whole<00:04:53.170> unit<00:04:53.470> right<00:04:53.770> here

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
the wall and this whole unit right here

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.090 
the wall and this whole unit right here
will<00:04:54.580> actually<00:04:54.610> be<00:04:54.970> closer<00:04:55.480> to<00:04:55.720> the<00:04:55.930> wall<00:04:56.140> so

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
will actually be closer to the wall so

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.040 
will actually be closer to the wall so
I'm<00:04:57.370> going<00:04:57.490> to<00:04:57.520> be<00:04:57.610> saving<00:04:58.030> a<00:04:58.120> lot<00:04:58.480> of<00:04:58.540> space
