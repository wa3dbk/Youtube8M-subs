00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:55.110 

you

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.920 

you

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
make sure to send it off I'd recommend

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.320 
make sure to send it off I'd recommend
using<00:02:20.770> a<00:02:21.010> primer<00:02:21.310> as<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:23.260> very<00:02:23.740> first<00:02:24.010> coat

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
because then you keep a primer it'll

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.920 
because then you keep a primer it'll
make<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.130> blue<00:02:27.310> pop<00:02:27.610> out<00:02:27.819> more<00:02:27.850> it<00:02:28.600> brings<00:02:28.780> in

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
make the blue pop out more it brings in

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.640
