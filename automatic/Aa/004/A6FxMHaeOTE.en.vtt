00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
amount of articulation by the looks of

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.290 
amount of articulation by the looks of
it<00:01:13.650> but<00:01:14.010> for<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.280> full<00:01:14.460> articulation<00:01:14.730> I'm

sure some reviewers will be picking this
up<00:01:17.760> and<00:01:18.090> showing<00:01:18.480> you<00:01:18.660> guys<00:01:18.690> the<00:01:19.110> next<00:01:19.740> thing

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
up and showing you guys the next thing

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.380 
up and showing you guys the next thing
that<00:01:20.130> I've<00:01:20.220> found<00:01:20.340> pretty<00:01:20.730> impressive<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.330> the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
that I've found pretty impressive is the

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.860 
that I've found pretty impressive is the
head<00:01:22.020> sculpt<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:23.160> actual<00:01:23.550> head<00:01:23.820> lights<00:01:24.270> up<00:01:24.540> so

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
head sculpt the actual head lights up so

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.240 
head sculpt the actual head lights up so
there's<00:01:25.200> batteries<00:01:25.410> that<00:01:25.710> go<00:01:25.740> in<00:01:26.010> and<00:01:26.190> that

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
there's batteries that go in and that

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.610 
there's batteries that go in and that
particular<00:01:26.580> point<00:01:27.150> lights<00:01:27.450> up<00:01:27.660> and<00:01:27.870> also<00:01:28.470> the

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:28.620 
particular point lights up and also the

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.270 
particular point lights up and also the
hands<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.760> non<00:01:30.090> gloved<00:01:30.630> hands<00:01:31.230> light<00:01:31.890> up<00:01:32.130> as

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
hands the non gloved hands light up as

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
hands the non gloved hands light up as
well<00:01:32.750> hot<00:01:33.750> toys<00:01:34.020> have<00:01:34.170> included<00:01:34.830> a<00:01:35.150> set<00:01:36.150> of

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
well hot toys have included a set of

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.480 
well hot toys have included a set of
tweezer<00:01:36.810> like<00:01:37.290> implements<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.010> help<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.340> put

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
tweezer like implements to help you put

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.460 
tweezer like implements to help you put
the<00:01:38.610> batteries<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.030> because<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.020> think<00:01:40.170> it's

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
the batteries in because I think it's

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.230 
the batteries in because I think it's
quite<00:01:40.590> deep<00:01:40.980> down<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.520> compartment<00:01:42.060> for<00:01:42.150> the

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
quite deep down the compartment for the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.640 
quite deep down the compartment for the
batteries<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.750> quite<00:01:42.990> deep<00:01:43.200> down<00:01:43.440> in<00:01:43.590> the

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
batteries is quite deep down in the

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.470 
batteries is quite deep down in the
figure<00:01:43.980> so<00:01:44.130> just<00:01:44.370> be<00:01:44.490> aware<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.120> may<00:01:45.270> be<00:01:45.330> a

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:45.480 
figure so just be aware is it may be a

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.990 
figure so just be aware is it may be a
little<00:01:45.630> bit<00:01:45.810> fiddly<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.140> do<00:01:46.410> that<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:47.850> other

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
little bit fiddly to do that the other

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.990 
little bit fiddly to do that the other
point<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.540> feel<00:01:49.080> is<00:01:49.110> quite<00:01:49.410> strong<00:01:49.830> is<00:01:50.070> the

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
point that I feel is quite strong is the

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.500 
point that I feel is quite strong is the
sort<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.630> voltage<00:01:52.170> electricity<00:01:52.820> effects<00:01:53.820> it's

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
sort of voltage electricity effects it's

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.990 
sort of voltage electricity effects it's
