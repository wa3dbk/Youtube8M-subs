00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.520
 hello, she, she, natalia, supervisors, biology, she uses where the 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.700
 stimulating the production of red blood cells 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.180
 the two questions that underlie our theme are why selections 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.740
 practice of the south are so concerned about the future of the states of 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.980
 of these states 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.759
 and what to do about this problem 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:24.619
 I do not know if you remembered but in 2009 the Brazilian team was playing in 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:26.199
 peace against bolivia 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.130
 and one that these penalized by the athletes 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.160
 but in interviews prior to the game was the fact that the ball rolls faster in the 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.600
 field and should feel a certain lack of air a certain lack of breath 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.020
 What happens then? 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.480
 and high altitude we know that the air is more rarefied 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.030
 the air resistance rises the ball decrease it rolls faster field 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.410
 in the same way this more rarefied air promotes a condition of low 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.290
 saturation of oxygen and our sisters one of our blood giving 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.160
 as the feeling of tiredness 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.160
 What to do then there is a relation to this problem 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.160
 if players avoid time or entities and believe in these conditions of 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.470
 high altitude 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.020
 this low oxygen saturation in the blood this condition said potency 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.990
 it is perceived by customers and the wines then releasing the hormone 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.070
 called eliton apoiei tina 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.159
 this hormone that stimulates the red bone marrow that is in our 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.840
 long bones to produce the greatest number of delays and this momentary condition 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.070
 of receiving elite and compensation 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.800
 to the rarefied one that saturates of inadequate form the masses and maximums three 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.580
 months you have an idea of ​​how important it is to some selections that 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.960
 go to world cup are already unpopular with high altitude as 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.240
 example of Italy's selection is hospitalized at 1800 meters above the level 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.130
 from the sea 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.280
 we consider 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.150
 that the highest stadium is the Johannesburg there is a 700 month chance 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.030
 meters above sea level 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.090
 they are to a great advantage 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.090
 another solution like that used by Japan's selection 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.929
 to the antilhas action of more expensive as settled in net in the ideb these masks 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.700
 which simulated that this condition of power leading then there is an elite 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.230
 receivers and they also take great advantage of our technical dunga believes 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.840
 arriving from criciúma nor santistas games there in south africa was already 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.280
 enough and that the scoreboard athletes is this people if so continue
