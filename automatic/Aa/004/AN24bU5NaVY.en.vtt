00:00:18.633 --> 00:00:22.467
 The elves and the shoemaker 

00:00:22.467 --> 00:00:29.800
 Rewritten by BookBox 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.050
 Peter Schumaker 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.050
 was a known shoemaker 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.883
 of all for his goodness. 

00:00:35.883 --> 00:00:37.050
 Alas he could not live 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.050
 his hard work. 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.633
 One day 

00:00:43.633 --> 00:00:45.633
 very cold and snow, 

00:00:45.633 --> 00:00:48.467
 he did not stay at the workshop anymore 

00:00:48.467 --> 00:00:50.383
 enough leather to sew 

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:54.800
 a last pair of shoes. 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.300
 That night, 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.883
 Peter cut carefully 

00:00:57.883 --> 00:00:59.717
 the precious leather, 

00:00:59.717 --> 00:01:02.717
 and put aside the pieces for sewing 

00:01:02.717 --> 00:01:07.800
 the next morning. 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.050
 From sunrise 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.300
 Peter was going to work 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.717
 when, to his surprise, 

00:01:18.717 --> 00:01:20.717
 he found on his workbench a magnificent 

00:01:20.717 --> 00:01:21.717
 pair of shoes. 

00:01:21.717 --> 00:01:27.550
 pair of shoes. 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.467
 " It's magic ! " 

00:01:29.467 --> 00:01:31.967
 exclaimed Cecilia, his wife 

00:01:31.967 --> 00:01:33.633
 and she hastened to put 

00:01:33.633 --> 00:01:35.383
 the pair in the showcase 

00:01:35.383 --> 00:01:37.300
 because the holiday season 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.800
 had just started. 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.050
 Luck is smiling at them. 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.383
 They went wonderfully to the whimsical 

00:01:45.383 --> 00:01:47.800
 Mrs. Sniggins 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.883
 who offered them 

00:01:49.883 --> 00:01:53.217
 a good sum. 

00:01:53.217 --> 00:01:54.633
 With this money, 

00:01:54.633 --> 00:01:57.633
 Peter bought some leather, 

00:01:57.633 --> 00:02:02.717
 just enough for two pairs. 

00:02:02.717 --> 00:02:04.050
 That night, 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.383
 he undertook again 

00:02:06.383 --> 00:02:08.633
 his cutting 

00:02:08.633 --> 00:02:11.467
 and left the pieces on the workbench 

00:02:11.467 --> 00:02:13.800
 before going to bed. 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.300
 Well inspired, 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:34.300
 he fell asleep dreaming of shoes. 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.133
 When he woke up 

00:02:35.133 --> 00:02:37.300
 the next morning, 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.883
 he found 

00:02:39.883 --> 00:02:41.883
 again two pairs 

00:02:41.883 --> 00:02:44.967
 superbly worked. 

00:02:44.967 --> 00:02:46.217
 Client 

00:02:46.217 --> 00:02:47.967
 hastened to buy them 

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:52.717
 because they were real masterpieces. 

00:02:52.717 --> 00:02:53.967
 This time Peter was able to buy 

00:02:53.967 --> 00:02:54.883
 leather 

00:02:54.883 --> 00:02:58.717
 for four pairs. 

00:02:58.717 --> 00:03:00.217
 The magic continued to operate 

00:03:00.217 --> 00:03:02.717
 for a while 

00:03:02.717 --> 00:03:04.300
 and the name of Schumaker 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.133
 became famous 

00:03:06.133 --> 00:03:08.883
 for the finesse of his shoes. 

00:03:08.883 --> 00:03:10.550
 Life 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.300
 was now easier 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.217
 for Peter and Cecilia. 

00:03:17.217 --> 00:03:20.967
 One day, Cecilia exclaimed: 

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:22.550
 "I'm wondering who could help us 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.967
 with so much zeal? " 

00:03:26.967 --> 00:03:29.133
 Peter announced to him: 

00:03:29.133 --> 00:03:30.633
 " Tonight, 

00:03:30.633 --> 00:03:32.217
 we will hide in the workshop 

00:03:32.217 --> 00:03:36.217
 to see what's going on! " 

00:03:36.217 --> 00:03:38.633
 And that's what they did. 

00:03:38.633 --> 00:03:42.133
 At midnight exactly, 

00:03:42.133 --> 00:03:44.300
 two tiny goblins entered on tiptoe 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.883
 and went to work 

00:03:48.883 --> 00:03:53.883
 without delay ! 

00:03:53.883 --> 00:03:56.300
 They were dressed in rags 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.467
 and did not even wear 

00:03:57.467 --> 00:04:02.633
 shoes. 

00:04:02.633 --> 00:04:04.633
 Before sunrise, 

00:04:04.633 --> 00:04:07.050
 they had already disappeared 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.133
 leaving several pairs of shoes 

00:04:09.133 --> 00:04:13.467
 for sale the next day. 

00:04:13.467 --> 00:04:14.717
 Peter and Cecilia 

00:04:14.717 --> 00:04:18.633
 were very grateful to the little elves 

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:19.800
 and worried about seeing them 

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.967
 work so hard 

00:04:20.967 --> 00:04:26.883
 by such a cold. 

00:04:26.883 --> 00:04:28.800
 So Peter made them 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.133
 two tiny pairs of shoes 

00:04:32.133 --> 00:04:33.633
 and Cecilia their cousit 

00:04:33.633 --> 00:04:35.383
 two small sets 

00:04:35.383 --> 00:04:39.133
 hot. 

00:04:39.133 --> 00:04:41.383
 Christmas Eve, 

00:04:41.383 --> 00:04:44.133
 instead of the usual pieces of leather, 

00:04:44.133 --> 00:04:45.633
 they arranged the little shoes 

00:04:45.633 --> 00:04:47.800
 and small sets 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.633
 and went to hide again. 

00:04:52.633 --> 00:04:55.883
 At midnight, 

00:04:55.883 --> 00:04:59.467
 the elves entered 

00:04:59.467 --> 00:05:04.383
 and saw the new clothes. 

00:05:04.383 --> 00:05:05.633
 In the blink of an eye, 

00:05:05.633 --> 00:05:06.217
 they seized it 

00:05:06.217 --> 00:05:09.883
 to cover yourself! 

00:05:09.883 --> 00:05:11.050
 They were so happy 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.300
 that they laughed and laughed again 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.300
 and went out dancing through the window 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.133
 never to return 

00:05:24.133 --> 00:05:25.883
 Peter continued to sew shoes 

00:05:25.883 --> 00:05:28.133
 day after day. 

00:05:28.133 --> 00:05:29.967
 He and Cecilia 

00:05:29.967 --> 00:05:32.050
 lived forever a happy life 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.550
 and fulfilled. 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:37.633
 Like the elves!
