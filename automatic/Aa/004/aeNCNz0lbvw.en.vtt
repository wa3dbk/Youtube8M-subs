00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 we went to interview bruno marioni 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.650
 Argentine state if there is a week 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.200
 our correspondent in europe the 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.019
 stars of argentina approaches with 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.090
 bruno I think the subject is very good because 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:16.260
 he was directed both by the volpe as 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.760
 by hugo and the truth is very clear 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.740
 perspectives of the two as well the 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.390
 quite interesting football although chart 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.730
 it is precisely the Marian chrono this former 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.230
 forward that out of examples 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:32.940
 sets I crossed with hugo in several 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:35.219
 opportunities and really always with the 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.200
 best wave always with the greatest of 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.809
 respect I keep a great 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.840
 thanks because he gave me the 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.320
 opportunity to get out this scorer did 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.539
 that the team will work for me so that 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.309
 I was a scorer in the last game 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.660
 he told you guys in free kick for you 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.579
 to bruno to criminal the party bruno the 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.920
 corner or for you to bruno 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.199
 let's try to help her and she made me 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.260
 make three goals in a match if I did 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.930
 three goals then I'm very 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.920
 grateful 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:11.730
 a guy who has an ego and pride 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.860
 bigger than it should be and by far 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.870
 for him, it hits a lot for him, he's a guy 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.290
 different from day to day treatment or not 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.920
 look 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.180
 of hugo you can say many things 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.530
 that you can share them you can 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.690
 sharing is a type also that has 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.690
 a very important ego 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.770
 hugo sanchez game sanchez we agree 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:40.220
 the volpe played in Mexico as big 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:44.950
 thanks to the viciousness and it was 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.850
 the third goalkeeper of the world cup 78 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.440
 let's say that the merits that hugo has 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.850
 Sanchez are much bigger 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:55.049
 incomparable of what they have to blows 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.620
 but there was sanchez the truth that 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.630
 humanly it is 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.790
 totally different in the deal for 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.770
 with the players he always told us 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.960
 be 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.460
 because they are going to happen because it led them to 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.769
 the best hotels because it's what 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.269
 better electoral you are stars 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.569
 you are figures 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:18.200
 I want you to feel like figures 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:20.420
 now after they show me then 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.530
 I go if the guy does not have to bank 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:27.799
 type 3 and then on a day to day basis is a 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.680
 kind of a deal very close to the player 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:33.470
 of football that was messing with you to 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.950
 play a minced that you had to 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:40.500
 stay as it is to teach you definition to 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.480
 practice definition stayed with you 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.930
 that has defects that also this one 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.950
 it came sometimes late that but the 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:53.300
 nothing positive balance was the clear is the 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.530
 only bicampeÃ³n of Mexican soccer 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.040
 with cougars 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.050
 so 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:05.010
 here we live in pumas we live 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:07.819
 very close is the fight the volpe there was to 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.310
 one passes bill 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.200
 all that war he had against the volpe 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.599
 as he was in the selection of hits 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.230
 when the claw was there it becomes everything 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.459
 against 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.459
 it did not work 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:26.330
 but hey I definitely do have to 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.970
 choose for one side 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.450
 I do not have analysis is very for the side of 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.450
 Hugo
