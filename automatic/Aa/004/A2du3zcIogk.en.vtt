write a large number like this now in
wood<00:00:35.780> form<00:00:36.910> okay<00:00:37.910> we're<00:00:38.090> going<00:00:38.239> to<00:00:38.300> get<00:00:38.449> to<00:00:38.629> the

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
wood form okay we're going to get to the

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.319 
wood form okay we're going to get to the
short<00:00:39.019> would<00:00:39.260> form<00:00:39.620> Internet<00:00:40.070> but<00:00:40.940> the<00:00:41.090> wood

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
short would form Internet but the wood

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.930 
short would form Internet but the wood
form<00:00:41.720> is<00:00:41.960> very<00:00:42.470> wordy<00:00:43.420> okay<00:00:44.420> to<00:00:45.260> to<00:00:46.250> express

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
form is very wordy okay to to express

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.060 
form is very wordy okay to to express
this<00:00:47.300> number<00:00:47.780> you're<00:00:48.769> going<00:00:48.949> to<00:00:49.040> write<00:00:49.280> two

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
this number you're going to write two

00:00:51.070 --> 00:01:04.560 
this number you're going to write two
million

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:11.580 

345

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:18.270 

flowers<00:01:12.430> and

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:26.850 

600

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.899 

seventy

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:42.209 

it<00:01:32.420> and<00:01:32.899> this<00:01:33.740> is<00:01:34.009> called<00:01:34.369> the<00:01:36.189> the<00:01:37.189> word<00:01:37.520> form

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:42.219 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:45.959 

so<00:01:43.219> basically<00:01:43.759> we<00:01:44.149> take<00:01:44.390> these<00:01:44.659> numerals<00:01:45.350> and

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:45.969 
so basically we take these numerals and

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:49.090 
so basically we take these numerals and
write<00:01:46.969> it<00:01:47.149> out<00:01:47.270> in<00:01:47.329> words<00:01:47.539> and<00:01:48.350> it's<00:01:48.649> pretty

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100

worded now we have what's known as the
short<00:01:53.479> word<00:01:53.810> form<00:01:54.140> which<00:01:54.979> contracts<00:01:55.880> this

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
short word form which contracts this

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.839 
short word form which contracts this
information<00:01:56.990> and<00:01:57.859> still<00:01:58.429> give<00:01:59.240> you<00:01:59.509> an<00:02:00.849> excuse
