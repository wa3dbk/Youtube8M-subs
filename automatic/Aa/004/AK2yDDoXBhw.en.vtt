hey there guys what's up I just want to
do<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.619> quick<00:00:16.949> kind<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.369> little<00:00:17.580> series<00:00:18.000> here<00:00:18.270> I

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
do a quick kind of little series here I

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.090 
do a quick kind of little series here I
guess<00:00:18.600> it's<00:00:19.050> only<00:00:19.170> probably<00:00:19.590> going<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.800> be<00:00:19.890> two

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
guess it's only probably going to be two

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.330 
guess it's only probably going to be two
videos<00:00:21.140> doing<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.260> flying<00:00:22.560> mount<00:00:22.830> glitch<00:00:23.070> for

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
videos doing the flying mount glitch for

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.560 
videos doing the flying mount glitch for
a<00:00:23.369> rig<00:00:23.550> amar<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:23.970> I<00:00:24.029> thought<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.359> would<00:00:24.420> be

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
a rig amar and I thought it would be

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.259 
a rig amar and I thought it would be
cool<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.810> show<00:00:25.230> off<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.740> overhead<00:00:26.699> view<00:00:27.210> of

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
cool to show off the overhead view of

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.750 
cool to show off the overhead view of
the<00:00:27.510> whole<00:00:27.689> place<00:00:27.930> because<00:00:28.859> it's<00:00:29.070> really<00:00:29.580> cool

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
the whole place because it's really cool

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.780 
the whole place because it's really cool
after<00:00:30.599> this<00:00:30.720> patch<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.410> was<00:00:31.890> kind<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.369> sketches

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
after this patch I was kind of sketches

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.780 
after this patch I was kind of sketches
sketchy<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:34.500> was<00:00:34.710> weird<00:00:35.219> whatever<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.700> just

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
sketchy that was weird whatever I just

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.160 
sketchy that was weird whatever I just
said<00:00:37.489> before<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:39.000> patch<00:00:39.180> about<00:00:39.600> everything

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
said before the patch about everything

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.290 
said before the patch about everything
changing<00:00:40.649> but<00:00:40.890> after<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.399> seeing<00:00:42.059> all<00:00:42.180> this

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
stuff it's pretty amazing it looks a lot

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.709 
stuff it's pretty amazing it looks a lot
better<00:00:45.360> i<00:00:45.510> think<00:00:46.969> so<00:00:47.969> i'm<00:00:48.059> using<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.450> flying

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
better i think so i'm using a flying

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.529 
better i think so i'm using a flying
mount<00:00:48.899> glitch<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:50.190> saw<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.730> i<00:00:51.270> wanted

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
mount glitch that you saw and i wanted

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.900 
mount glitch that you saw and i wanted
to<00:00:51.570> just<00:00:51.719> get<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.379> hold<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.160> footage<00:00:53.610> you

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
to just get a hold of that footage you

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.750 
to just get a hold of that footage you
know<00:00:54.059> before<00:00:54.449> they<00:00:54.600> took<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.840> away<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.410> before

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
know before they took it away and before

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.549 
know before they took it away and before
actual<00:00:56.760> cataclysm<00:00:57.360> come<00:00:57.539> out<00:00:57.719> once<00:00:58.410> again

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
actual cataclysm come out once again

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.220 
actual cataclysm come out once again
this<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:58.890> on<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.129> live<00:00:59.430> server<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.239> everything

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
this is on a live server so everything

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.039 
this is on a live server so everything
you<00:01:01.350> know<00:01:02.120> just<00:01:03.120> kind<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.300> showing<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.690> off<00:01:03.809> i

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
you know just kind of showing it off i

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.370 
you know just kind of showing it off i
think<00:01:04.379> they<00:01:04.559> they<00:01:05.070> did<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.519> great<00:01:05.880> job<00:01:06.380> with

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
think they they did a great job with

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.050 
think they they did a great job with
everything<00:01:09.080> like<00:01:10.100> they<00:01:11.100> have<00:01:11.340> all<00:01:11.640> of

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
everything like they have all of

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.750 
everything like they have all of
everything<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.100> right<00:01:14.100> up<00:01:14.250> there<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.610> can

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
everything and right up there you can

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.030 
everything and right up there you can
see<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:15.330> kind<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.810> fly<00:01:16.020> over<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.650> everything

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
see I kind of fly over it and everything

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.030 
see I kind of fly over it and everything
but<00:01:17.729> um<00:01:18.020> they<00:01:19.020> made<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:19.530> it's<00:01:19.799> not<00:01:19.979> really

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
but um they made it so it's not really

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.300 
but um they made it so it's not really
no<00:01:20.820> longer<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.270> glitch<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:22.259> be<00:01:22.409> on<00:01:22.590> top<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.159> her

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
no longer a glitch to be on top of her

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.969 
no longer a glitch to be on top of her
it<00:01:23.490> more<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.970> remember<00:01:24.720> using<00:01:24.960> like<00:01:25.439> having<00:01:25.860> to

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
it more I remember using like having to

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.429 
it more I remember using like having to
go<00:01:26.130> through<00:01:26.430> all<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.670> steps<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.420> get<00:01:28.110> on<00:01:28.229> top

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
go through all the steps to get on top

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.410 
go through all the steps to get on top
of<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.680> like<00:01:28.860> jumping<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:29.460> top<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:30.000> Zeppelin

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
of it like jumping on top of a Zeppelin

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.120 
of it like jumping on top of a Zeppelin
and<00:01:30.630> then<00:01:30.720> jumping<00:01:31.170> off<00:01:31.320> on<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.530> Ledge<00:01:31.799> and

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
and then jumping off on a Ledge and

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.399 
and then jumping off on a Ledge and
doing<00:01:32.880> all<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.180> stuff<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.600> get<00:01:33.750> up<00:01:33.869> on<00:01:34.020> top<00:01:34.200> of

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
doing all this stuff to get up on top of

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.859 
doing all this stuff to get up on top of
our<00:01:34.500> rig<00:01:34.710> amar<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.180> that<00:01:36.180> was<00:01:36.270> pretty<00:01:36.390> fun<00:01:36.659> but

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
our rig amar and that was pretty fun but

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.030 
our rig amar and that was pretty fun but
now<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.079> can<00:01:37.259> actually<00:01:37.409> just<00:01:37.740> take<00:01:37.920> an

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
now you can actually just take an

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.249 
now you can actually just take an
elevator<00:01:38.280> up<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.850> right<00:01:39.450> around<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:40.079> it's

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
elevator up and right around and it's

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.690 
elevator up and right around and it's
actually<00:01:40.650> pretty<00:01:40.799> cool<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.250> look<00:01:41.369> at<00:01:41.520> some<00:01:41.670> of

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
actually pretty cool to look at some of

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.249 
actually pretty cool to look at some of
the<00:01:41.820> sites<00:01:42.170> um<00:01:43.170> if<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:44.430> do<00:01:44.670> own<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.479> game<00:01:45.630> and

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
the sites um if you do own the game and

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.200 
the sites um if you do own the game and
you<00:01:47.040> haven't<00:01:47.369> really<00:01:47.579> checked<00:01:47.729> out<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:47.970> rig

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
you haven't really checked out a rig

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.420 
you haven't really checked out a rig
amor<00:01:48.479> good<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.049> got<00:01:49.409> up<00:01:49.560> on<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.740> top<00:01:49.979> I<00:01:50.159> really

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.330 
cataclysmic event and like the splitting
of<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.490> barons<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.420> all<00:02:06.509> that<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.340> tornadoes

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
of the barons and all that and tornadoes

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.050 
of the barons and all that and tornadoes
and<00:02:08.789> all<00:02:09.030> this<00:02:09.239> stuff<00:02:09.679> I<00:02:10.679> think<00:02:11.640> it's<00:02:11.790> really

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
and all this stuff I think it's really

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.080 
and all this stuff I think it's really
cool

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
cool

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.240 
cool
at<00:02:13.629> the<00:02:13.810> end<00:02:13.930> here<00:02:14.170> I<00:02:14.200> add<00:02:14.440> in<00:02:14.680> a<00:02:14.769> little<00:02:14.800> piece

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
at the end here I add in a little piece

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.729 
at the end here I add in a little piece
that<00:02:15.640> I<00:02:15.700> thought<00:02:15.910> looks<00:02:16.239> really<00:02:16.569> cool<00:02:16.780> of<00:02:17.050> the

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
that I thought looks really cool of the

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.570 
that I thought looks really cool of the
split<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.489> the<00:02:18.580> Barons<00:02:19.590> but<00:02:20.590> i'll<00:02:21.280> just<00:02:21.430> talk

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
split and the Barons but i'll just talk

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.130 
split and the Barons but i'll just talk
about<00:02:21.760> what<00:02:22.090> we're<00:02:22.390> looking<00:02:22.690> at<00:02:22.750> here<00:02:22.810> you

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
about what we're looking at here you

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.199 
about what we're looking at here you
know<00:02:23.260> so<00:02:23.500> this<00:02:23.680> is<00:02:23.860> like<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.459> top<00:02:24.730> kind<00:02:25.090> of

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
know so this is like the top kind of

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.040 
know so this is like the top kind of
plateau<00:02:25.420> thing<00:02:27.420> this<00:02:28.420> is<00:02:28.569> where<00:02:28.750> like<00:02:28.900> the

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
plateau thing this is where like the

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.869 
plateau thing this is where like the
flightmaster<00:02:29.530> is<00:02:29.830> located<00:02:30.370> and<00:02:30.489> everything

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
flightmaster is located and everything

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.850 
flightmaster is located and everything
I'm<00:02:31.540> just<00:02:31.720> flying<00:02:31.989> up<00:02:32.140> pretty<00:02:32.349> high<00:02:32.410> to<00:02:32.620> give

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
I'm just flying up pretty high to give

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.479 
I'm just flying up pretty high to give
you<00:02:32.950> guys<00:02:33.099> like<00:02:33.370> an<00:02:33.489> eagle's<00:02:33.849> eye<00:02:33.970> view<00:02:35.489> kind

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
you guys like an eagle's eye view kind

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.619 
you guys like an eagle's eye view kind
of<00:02:36.549> swooped<00:02:36.790> down<00:02:36.879> here<00:02:37.410> you<00:02:38.410> know<00:02:38.560> I<00:02:38.799> think

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
of swooped down here you know I think

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.150 
of swooped down here you know I think
just<00:02:40.629> once<00:02:40.840> again<00:02:40.989> that<00:02:41.410> they<00:02:41.680> did<00:02:41.860> a<00:02:41.890> great

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
just once again that they did a great

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.300 
just once again that they did a great
job<00:02:42.190> like<00:02:43.120> it<00:02:43.330> has<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.810> same<00:02:44.080> basic<00:02:44.920> structure

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
job like it has the same basic structure

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.000 
job like it has the same basic structure
on<00:02:46.000> a<00:02:46.060> ground<00:02:46.540> level<00:02:46.840> but<00:02:47.709> then<00:02:47.860> they<00:02:47.980> also

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
on a ground level but then they also

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.400 
on a ground level but then they also
added<00:02:48.519> it<00:02:48.790> like<00:02:48.970> height<00:02:49.450> wise<00:02:49.720> just<00:02:50.049> straight

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
added it like height wise just straight

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.740 
added it like height wise just straight
up<00:02:50.440> um<00:02:50.890> because<00:02:51.700> now<00:02:51.910> you<00:02:51.970> can<00:02:52.150> actually<00:02:52.420> take

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
up um because now you can actually take

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.680 
up um because now you can actually take
elevators<00:02:53.410> up<00:02:53.709> into<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:54.730> sky<00:02:54.970> and<00:02:55.000> into<00:02:55.420> the

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
elevators up into the sky and into the

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.990 
elevators up into the sky and into the
like<00:02:55.959> flightmaster<00:02:56.470> and<00:02:56.829> everything<00:02:57.160> and<00:02:57.910> I

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
like flightmaster and everything and I

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.729 
like flightmaster and everything and I
think<00:02:58.239> they<00:02:58.360> did<00:02:58.540> a<00:02:58.569> great<00:02:58.810> job<00:02:58.840> with<00:02:59.079> that<00:02:59.260> and

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
think they did a great job with that and

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.699 
think they did a great job with that and
I<00:03:00.700> go<00:03:01.090> on<00:03:01.269> this<00:03:01.390> hold<00:03:01.720> for<00:03:02.170> a<00:03:02.200> little<00:03:02.290> bit<00:03:02.470> I

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
I go on this hold for a little bit I

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.170 
I go on this hold for a little bit I
don't<00:03:02.980> want<00:03:03.129> to<00:03:03.220> check<00:03:03.400> it<00:03:03.519> out<00:03:03.610> much<00:03:03.819> because

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
don't want to check it out much because

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.250 
don't want to check it out much because
it's<00:03:04.540> kind<00:03:04.720> of<00:03:04.750> laggy<00:03:04.959> in<00:03:05.200> there<00:03:05.410> but<00:03:06.340> um<00:03:06.959> so<00:03:07.959> I

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
it's kind of laggy in there but um so I

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.569 
it's kind of laggy in there but um so I
get<00:03:08.470> on<00:03:08.560> out<00:03:08.739> of<00:03:08.769> there<00:03:09.360> but<00:03:10.360> um<00:03:11.069> they<00:03:12.069> added<00:03:12.489> a

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
get on out of there but um they added a

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.059 
get on out of there but um they added a
bunch<00:03:12.879> of<00:03:13.120> new<00:03:13.329> stuff<00:03:13.360> I<00:03:13.959> think<00:03:14.709> it's<00:03:14.860> all

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
bunch of new stuff I think it's all

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.050 
bunch of new stuff I think it's all
really<00:03:15.280> great<00:03:15.549> and<00:03:17.160> that's<00:03:18.160> about<00:03:18.400> it<00:03:18.549> for<00:03:18.790> a

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
really great and that's about it for a

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.910 
really great and that's about it for a
rig<00:03:19.209> amor<00:03:19.480> I<00:03:19.720> explored<00:03:20.260> all<00:03:20.440> but<00:03:20.650> you<00:03:20.799> know

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
rig amor I explored all but you know

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.530 
rig amor I explored all but you know
being<00:03:21.190> on<00:03:21.340> a<00:03:21.370> flying<00:03:21.609> mount<00:03:21.790> like<00:03:22.030> that<00:03:22.180> I<00:03:22.209> can

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
being on a flying mount like that I can

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.870 
being on a flying mount like that I can
cover<00:03:22.920> massive<00:03:23.920> amount<00:03:24.160> of<00:03:24.250> area<00:03:24.459> in<00:03:24.609> a<00:03:24.700> quick
