enhance our notes if we're going to
Franklin<00:01:35.340> or<00:01:35.580> I<00:01:35.729> can<00:01:35.970> highlight<00:01:36.560> inexpensive

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
Franklin or I can highlight inexpensive

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.840 
Franklin or I can highlight inexpensive
more<00:01:39.270> interesting<00:01:39.990> we<00:01:40.890> have<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.070> second<00:01:41.700> piece

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
more interesting we have a second piece

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.139 
more interesting we have a second piece
of<00:01:42.090> software<00:01:42.979> then<00:01:43.979> we<00:01:44.070> can<00:01:44.280> take<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.790> into

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
of software then we can take that into

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.350 
of software then we can take that into
the<00:01:45.509> recognition<00:01:46.200> software<00:01:46.440> and<00:01:47.360> convert

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
the recognition software and convert

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.070 
the recognition software and convert
that<00:01:48.660> into<00:01:49.259> digital<00:01:49.440> text

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.610 

no<00:01:53.710> you<00:01:54.070> can<00:01:54.220> see<00:01:54.490> it<00:01:55.330> hasn't<00:01:55.630> got<00:01:56.080> did<00:01:56.470> you

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
no you can see it hasn't got did you

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.190 
no you can see it hasn't got did you
memo<00:01:56.950> riotous<00:01:57.520> but<00:01:57.760> this<00:01:58.000> is<00:01:58.210> the<00:01:58.360> origin<00:01:58.690> gyro

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
memo riotous but this is the origin gyro

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.430 
memo riotous but this is the origin gyro
and<00:01:59.680> it's<00:02:00.010> easy<00:02:00.190> to<00:02:00.520> use<00:02:00.730> and<00:02:00.760> inexpensive

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
and it's easy to use and inexpensive

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.170 
and it's easy to use and inexpensive
that's<00:02:02.440> because<00:02:02.950> it<00:02:03.220> doesn't<00:02:03.520> know<00:02:03.790> the<00:02:03.970> word

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
that's because it doesn't know the word

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.080 
that's because it doesn't know the word
digi<00:02:04.690> memo<00:02:05.020> so<00:02:05.830> we're<00:02:06.100> going<00:02:06.340> to<00:02:06.460> teach<00:02:06.700> it<00:02:06.940> a

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
digi memo so we're going to teach it a

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:16.479 
digi memo so we're going to teach it a
new<00:02:07.300> word<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:09.009> word<00:02:09.220> is<00:02:09.869> remember

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.910 

so<00:02:17.060> if<00:02:17.150> we<00:02:17.299> run<00:02:17.480> that<00:02:17.540> recognition<00:02:18.170> again<00:02:20.920> we

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
so if we run that recognition again we

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.190 
so if we run that recognition again we
now<00:02:22.099> get<00:02:22.310> this<00:02:22.579> is<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:22.879> digi<00:02:23.090> memo<00:02:23.540> it's<00:02:23.959> easy

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
now get this is the digi memo it's easy

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.589 
now get this is the digi memo it's easy
to<00:02:24.469> use<00:02:24.650> an<00:02:24.829> inexpensive<00:02:25.329> how<00:02:26.329> cool<00:02:26.599> is<00:02:26.840> that

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
to use an inexpensive how cool is that

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.789 
to use an inexpensive how cool is that
what<00:02:29.599> I've<00:02:29.719> got<00:02:29.959> here<00:02:30.200> is<00:02:30.379> some<00:02:30.409> other

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
what I've got here is some other

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:32.440 
what I've got here is some other
demonstrations<00:02:31.640> that<00:02:31.849> will<00:02:32.000> just<00:02:32.209> show<00:02:32.299> you

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
demonstrations that will just show you

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.800 
demonstrations that will just show you
its<00:02:32.750> capabilities<00:02:34.120> because<00:02:35.120> not<00:02:35.329> only<00:02:35.359> will

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
its capabilities because not only will

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.399 
its capabilities because not only will
it<00:02:35.959> humble<00:02:36.379> text<00:02:37.930> but<00:02:38.930> we<00:02:39.049> can<00:02:39.230> handle

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:39.409 
it humble text but we can handle

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:44.530 
it humble text but we can handle
formatting<00:02:42.849> here<00:02:43.849> we've<00:02:44.150> got<00:02:44.269> an<00:02:44.420> example

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
formatting here we've got an example

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.119 
formatting here we've got an example
with<00:02:45.230> bullet<00:02:45.590> points<00:02:46.090> with<00:02:47.090> numbers

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
with bullet points with numbers

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.369

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:52.140 
highlighting the different colors there
you<00:02:51.500> go

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
you go

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.280 
you go
totally<00:02:53.150> converted<00:02:54.730> one<00:02:55.730> button<00:02:56.239> then<00:02:57.139> you've

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
totally converted one button then you've

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.369 
totally converted one button then you've
got<00:02:57.500> that<00:02:57.530> into<00:02:57.950> Microsoft<00:02:58.489> Word<00:02:59.079> I've<00:03:00.079> blown

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 
got that into Microsoft Word I've blown

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.259 
got that into Microsoft Word I've blown
it<00:03:00.560> up<00:03:00.739> by<00:03:00.950> the<00:03:01.010> way<00:03:01.219> so<00:03:01.280> that<00:03:01.489> you<00:03:01.760> can<00:03:01.909> read<00:03:02.120> it

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269
