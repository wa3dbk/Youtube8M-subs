00:00:16.153 --> 00:00:19.996
So let's say you are rocking the pond in, and
something happens and you tear the liner.

00:00:19.996 --> 00:00:21.891
I don't want you to think that
it's the end of the world,

00:00:21.891 --> 00:00:23.790
because it's real simple to fix.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.035
Right here, the red paint, I've identified
a couple of holes in the liner,

00:00:28.035 --> 00:00:32.358
we're gonna clean this up, put a patch on it,
show you how simple it is to fix.

00:00:34.736 --> 00:00:38.358
So the first thing we wanna do is, we wanna
make sure we have the appropriate size patch.

00:00:40.947 --> 00:00:43.672
Once we have the patch done,
let me show you a tip here.

00:00:43.672 --> 00:00:46.460
We wanna cut the corners here,

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.780
it's the only time you're gonna find The
Pond Digger crew cutting corners on the job site.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.660
What this does, is it keeps the edges
from fraying and wanting to peel up.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.400
So make sure you do that
if you got any patches.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.890
Once we have that done we're gonna take a dry
towel and we're gonna just wipe off the,

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.270
the dust and
powder that might be in, in the way.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.791
And then we grab a different
towel and we'll get some liner primer and

00:01:10.791 --> 00:01:13.232
rub in a circular
pattern over the patch.

00:01:18.863 --> 00:01:24.046
Now, if your patch is, say, five by five,
you wanna be cleaning an area approximately

00:01:24.046 --> 00:01:28.900
six by six or seven by seven, clean the area
a little bit bigger than your patches.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.133
Now the way you wanna test it,
is you wanna touch your finger on it, and

00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:39.479
you will see it just wanted to
stick to your finger a little bit,

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.041
that's about the perfect time to go ahead and
stick your patch on.

00:01:50.866 --> 00:01:54.941
We always use a roller to roll out any
air bubbles that might be in there.

00:02:00.059 --> 00:02:02.360
Push all the sides down evenly.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.820
Now if your in an area that you don't
have a nice flat spot behind the liner

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.050
then stick a piece of wood or

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.380
something back behind there so
that you have a nice flat surface to work on.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.740
Now one extra step that we do out
in the field is we'll put a bead of

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.950
polyurethane around the the edge
its kind of like a lap seal.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.092
Just a little extra technique we do out
in the field, and you're good as new.

00:02:34.592 --> 00:02:36.124
And this thing's ready
to hold water right now.

00:02:47.838 --> 00:02:51.760
So as you can see,
patching the liner is a real simple process.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.601
Don't let it ruin your day if
you get a hole in the liner.

00:02:54.601 --> 00:02:57.342
If you have any questions,
if your uncertain about anything,

00:02:57.342 --> 00:03:00.669
just list them in the comments section
I'll get to every single one of them.

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:03.908
I'm Eric Triplett, The Pond Digger,
thanks for watching.
