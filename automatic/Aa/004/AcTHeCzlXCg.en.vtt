00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.710
 throughout this second season of 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.660
 more than dogs and cats we have had the 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.100
 pleasure to know a little more about 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.529
 some of our faces more 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.029
 known and we want to thank you 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.040
 enormously that they have opened a 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.230
 little hole in your heart a very 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.930
 important he who occupies in his animals 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.120
 still in the subway with some friends who 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.130
 suddenly in the car because I did not know 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.140
 like an uproar and such not suddenly 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.570
 look there was already a plastic bag with 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.120
 a a padded jacket in the 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.950
 had hawai already had an entire already 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.180
 greater and from that moment 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.180
 he got into my life 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.300
 right now I have three cats and lucas one 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.370
 of them good all rescued from the 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.470
 street one of them got into the car 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.080
 we were on the plates recording and 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.820
 when I left the plate open the door 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.270
 of the car and then he got 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.700
 directly then well as that 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.710
 I do with him then lucas how he lives with 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.710
 three cats he thinks he's cat 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.970
 and he looked at me I looked at him and it was like a 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.440
 love story directly because 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.150
 we had an arrow for both 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.800
 when he looks at me with those little eyes one of 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.240
 each color to put the little paw look at their 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.660
 neighbors because it is half to give kisses with 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.310
 the tongue and you feel like you 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.070
 you feel very spoiled by that situation or 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.990
 be it is a special moment 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.280
 I the truth is that I am very good and I 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.890
 they love dogs so anyone 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.640
 I'm going to talk, I do not know, it's that 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.640
 Drool with them 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.130
 but if there is something they all have 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.810
 in common is how much they miss 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.750
 to his faithful friends when they are far away 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.400
 from home when your profession forces you to 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.440
 being too far away from the 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.270
 yours the moment of the reunion is 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.270
 it becomes something very special 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.300
 I do not know if I would know how to get home from 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:16.650
 find me a dog when I'm 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:19.620
 trip for example if I'm going for a walk 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.230
 paris with sao paulo santiago I will give 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.299
 a walk I see a dog and looking at it like that 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.000
 as saying with a little piano a 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.520
 little nostalgia 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.740
 you do not know that there is someone waiting for you and 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.770
 just also maximum are always 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.090
 every time they hear the keys and I open 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.710
 the door are always behind the 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.860
 door I hope not when it comes to 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.570
 receive me home when I get that gives me 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.810
 a lot of joy and he receives me with more love 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.810
 that nobody 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:52.350
 it's a festival and that's guaranteed 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.350
 enter the case of joy 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.840
 do not 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.530
 because all of us who share our 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.360
 life with a dog or a cat we know that 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.400
 between us and them there is a 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.950
 relationship of love so strong that possesses 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.160
 some unbreakable links I think 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.650
 It's very nice to live with animals and I 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.080
 I think a dog has a lot 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.240
 intuition and know when you're wrong when 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.130
 you're fine any time in Qatar 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:25.200
 of Christ the dreams of making 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.200
 especially girls this is wonderful 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.570
 I love what the most has for the 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:33.120
 nobility he has and the shepherds 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.790
 animals are very faithful very faithful and 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.800
 is mostly silly of good fool 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.780
 of flight he puts his back to the grass and 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.750
 you start reporting how to take the 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.070
 smell of the grass and super curious because 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.750
 when he gave it but what are you doing 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.150
 changing me as well as saying no 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.040
 short is the point when it comes and it is 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.470
 backwards if you touch your tummy 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.950
 that the day I'm missing I do not know what's going 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.260
 happen 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.260
 she is the companion of my life 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.190
 the pump has many toys have 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.140
 many hairs out there we go let's go 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.810
 recapitulating that they are giving it away but 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.880
 this one in particular loves it because to see 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.940
 As you can see, wait for a 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.940
 second 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:27.550
 as you can see the case that makes me 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.550
 because I have 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:36.830
 when I with the guitar at home 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.180
 the oil very bad if I fall asleep 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.730
 playing the guitar that will not be 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.440
 doing very badly 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.150
 so you have to pick them up maybe and 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.200
 here 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.200
 there is no glamor worth 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.879
 I went 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:57.340
 there are many tasks by character I am 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:57.340
 quite quite critical 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.729
 my family my dogs do not bite or 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.580
 the thieves upside down I think that you already 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:11.289
 would say happens and shows you the house so that 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:15.580
 see how we get around the world well 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:16.969
 this is where they usually leave two for 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.929
 site 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:19.929
 at 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:25.030
 ah 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.030
 and
