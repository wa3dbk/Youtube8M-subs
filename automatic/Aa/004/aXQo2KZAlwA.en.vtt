I was thinking of it trainer I was
thinking<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.530> trying<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.189> hit<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.340> numbers

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
thinking of it trying to hit a numbers

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.420 
thinking of it trying to hit a numbers
my<00:01:56.880> coaches<00:01:57.240> were<00:01:57.360> giving<00:01:57.659> me<00:01:58.100> where<00:01:59.100> my<00:01:59.220> next

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
my coaches were giving me where my next

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.609 
my coaches were giving me where my next
competition<00:01:59.610> would<00:02:00.150> be<00:02:00.330> what<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.260> would<00:02:01.350> want

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
competition would be what I would want

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.249

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
it left at that competition too because

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.450 
it left at that competition too because
we<00:02:04.380> were<00:02:04.500> always<00:02:04.650> target<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.250> trying<00:02:05.400> to

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
from what stage did you start thinking

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.880 
from what stage did you start thinking
