 ford fiesta enduro 1.3 first thing 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.830
 What are you going to do as you change it? 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.350
 here is take water pump you take 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.439
 water pump because it's necessary for you 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.650
 release the housing after you 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.980
 took the ball before that to drop it here 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:31.160
 the crankshaft bolt you put a 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:34.489
 screwdriver there right here google ante 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.950
 hold it and turn counter-clockwise 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:40.350
 here on the screw head after 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.120
 You just missed the pulley, you're going to take the 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.489
 water pump after you took it out 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.289
 water pump puts it in sync 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.320
 on the large pulley 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.489
 I'll put it here for you two 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.809
 police 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.710
 a large and a small police 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.809
 great 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.170
 she has a brand here she has a brand 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.170
 here o 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:13.380
 and the small one also has a brand is type 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:14.719
 a foot of chicken that is like this 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.500
 timing 

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:22.890
 it has to be simulated one from the front 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.979
 to the other you turn to them 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.039
 to be the same here as the one facing the 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.170
 another and then he is at the point 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:32.130
 after you put it in there 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:38.640
 timing 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:42.569
 here you come and pull the pulleys in two 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:46.590
 bolts uÃ© t-10 the bolt wrench 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:49.319
 of the large pulley and the small pulley 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.959
 that is the key for you to take the 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:56.640
 synchronizer that stays here 

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:59.549
 you take thought you need loosen up 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.700
 the postman you do not have to take the 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.700
 car you loose it low it a 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.609
 and then you take off and 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.549
 put another one as it has regulation 

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:14.519
 automatic it will regulate itself is in the 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:16.639
 time you put beauty and staff 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.829
 after I finished putting the 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:23.310
 abort a detail when you place the 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:26.700
 crown larger than you put the chain 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.609
 you put down smaller then you fit 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.930
 current in the smaller dome and then 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:35.730
 you pick up and put away the bigger crown 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.669
 because otherwise you can not fit 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.169
 there after you put you tight 

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:42.660
 on two screws that I 'll show on 

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:43.769
 I'll show you where it is. 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.919
 placed right 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:51.690
 here is the redeeming cap 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:55.230
 After you've done everything you need to 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.269
 a new tac and the old one I will change because 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.430
 otherwise it will leak after you have made the 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.810
 that every service will leak the retainer 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.940
 by v 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.220
 the eye but roll the melamine box 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.590
 so it's important that you 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.630
 replace the new retainer 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.620
 I'll show you how you stayed here. 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.030
 down 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.959
 As it is already here, it is already 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.140
 already mounted in place already 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.800
 synced 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.440
 now just put the lid and put 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.269
 To run, do not forget the 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.599
 first step the first thing that goes 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.819
 Make you loose the police. 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.630
 pulley bolts places a key 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.630
 crevice 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:39.390
 there on the steering wheel I learned there on the steering wheel that 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.790
 there is a space that you loosen after 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:45.299
 You loosen up, you take out the bomb. 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.160
 water removed the band puts in place 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.750
 after you removed the water pump 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.860
 this step by step 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.180
 You take the pulley and you take that 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.880
 cover 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.920
 after you took off the lid you see 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.950
 in the gears I'll get two 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:05.100
 gear here this here are the two 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.500
 police and the current 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.190
 here we have the chain so here it goes 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.090
 work yes if you pay attention 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:16.229
 very attention 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.880
 You will see that here in the police you have a 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:22.049
 The point is seeing here b that has a 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:25.800
 dot is a film a hole and here in the 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:28.650
 smaller pulley has a foot kibon brand of 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:34.919
 chicken or inverted y are seeing this 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:37.530
 here you can see she has to stay 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.900
 synchronized it has to stay that way and 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.870
 This has to stay in front of the 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.330
 another O here to here to not leave 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.669
 time position as it is called 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:51.210
 done that you put in that position 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:54.570
 Do not let go anymore you had her and 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:57.110
 you can work quietly placed 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:00.389
 again and cause the maintenance 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.979
