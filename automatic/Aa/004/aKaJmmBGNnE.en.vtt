00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
it's like these boundaries between

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.170 
it's like these boundaries between
styles<00:02:44.890> of<00:02:45.010> music<00:02:45.070> could<00:02:45.400> be<00:02:45.430> broken<00:02:45.730> down<00:02:45.880> by

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
styles of music could be broken down by

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.130 
styles of music could be broken down by
artists<00:02:46.420> such<00:02:46.450> as<00:02:46.570> yourself<00:02:46.960> I<00:02:47.610> think<00:02:49.140> there

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
artists such as yourself I think there

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.900 
artists such as yourself I think there
is<00:02:50.170> a<00:02:50.290> lot<00:02:50.410> of<00:02:50.590> kids<00:02:51.070> and<00:02:52.410> man<00:02:53.490> doing<00:02:54.490> amazing

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
is a lot of kids and man doing amazing

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.030 
is a lot of kids and man doing amazing
music<00:02:55.330> with<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:55.900> right<00:02:56.050> reasons<00:02:56.650> with<00:02:57.010> the

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
music with the right reasons with the

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.570 
music with the right reasons with the
heart<00:02:57.310> in<00:02:57.580> the<00:02:57.700> right<00:02:57.730> place<00:02:57.880> so<00:02:59.100> I<00:03:00.100> think<00:03:00.430> it's

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
heart in the right place so I think it's

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.640 
heart in the right place so I think it's
just<00:03:00.640> getting<00:03:00.940> better<00:03:01.150> and<00:03:01.330> better<00:03:01.630> but<00:03:02.530> the
