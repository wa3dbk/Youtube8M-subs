00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
taken lots of lots of practice so it's

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.040 
taken lots of lots of practice so it's
not<00:00:17.580> as<00:00:17.760> easy<00:00:17.970> as<00:00:18.090> just<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.570> steps<00:00:18.869> we're

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
not as easy as just the steps we're

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.150 
not as easy as just the steps we're
going<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.260> show<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:19.500> we're<00:00:19.740> going<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.890> try<00:00:20.100> to

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
going to show you we're going to try to

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.330 
going to show you we're going to try to
move<00:00:20.369> pretty<00:00:20.939> fast<00:00:21.090> for<00:00:21.660> time<00:00:21.869> sake<00:00:22.199> but<00:00:22.980> these

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
move pretty fast for time sake but these

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.769 
move pretty fast for time sake but these
are<00:00:23.490> some<00:00:23.670> steps<00:00:23.939> that<00:00:24.060> have<00:00:24.240> helped<00:00:24.480> us<00:00:24.630> learn

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
are some steps that have helped us learn

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.359 
are some steps that have helped us learn
back<00:00:25.019> handsprings<00:00:25.500> around<00:00:25.740> here<00:00:25.920> for<00:00:26.130> years

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
back handsprings around here for years

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.009 
back handsprings around here for years
so<00:00:26.910> we<00:00:27.060> just<00:00:27.210> wanted<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.480> share<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:27.810> with<00:00:27.930> all

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
so we just wanted to share it with all

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.599 
so we just wanted to share it with all
of<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.230> guys<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:29.010> first<00:00:29.250> thing<00:00:29.490> that's

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
of you guys the first thing that's

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.820 
of you guys the first thing that's
important<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.269> handstand<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:31.410> start<00:00:31.740> with

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
important is a handstand so start with

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.319 
important is a handstand so start with
the<00:00:31.920> arms<00:00:32.160> behind<00:00:32.340> your<00:00:32.550> ears<00:00:32.790> make<00:00:33.120> sure<00:00:33.300> a

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
the arms behind your ears make sure a

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.479 
the arms behind your ears make sure a
very<00:00:33.600> tight<00:00:33.960> body<00:00:34.290> position<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.070> then

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
very tight body position and then

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.010 
very tight body position and then
they'll<00:00:35.640> kick<00:00:35.850> up<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.239> handstand<00:00:38.870> see<00:00:39.870> the

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
they'll kick up to a handstand see the

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.600 
they'll kick up to a handstand see the
safe<00:00:40.230> position<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.920> when<00:00:41.070> she<00:00:41.219> was<00:00:41.340> standing

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
safe position is when she was standing

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.000 
safe position is when she was standing
she's<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.180> straight<00:00:42.570> line<00:00:42.600> body<00:00:43.469> position

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
she's in a straight line body position

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.100 
she's in a straight line body position
handstand<00:00:44.460> this<00:00:45.030> need<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.329> be<00:00:45.539> extremely

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
handstand this need to be extremely

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.080 
handstand this need to be extremely
strong<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.370> first<00:00:47.579> place<00:00:47.879> that

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
strong and this is the first place that

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.450 
strong and this is the first place that
it<00:00:48.239> starts<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.410> next<00:00:49.710> thing<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:49.890> we<00:00:50.129> will<00:00:50.280> do

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
it starts the next thing that we will do

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.130 
it starts the next thing that we will do
is<00:00:50.640> we're<00:00:50.850> using<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:51.239> couple<00:00:51.480> travel<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:51.989> do

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
is we're using a couple travel to do

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.139 
is we're using a couple travel to do
this<00:00:52.320> she<00:00:52.949> could<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.219> jumped<00:00:53.579> angle<00:00:53.910> flat

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
this she could you jumped angle flat

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.240 
this she could you jumped angle flat
back<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.840> learn<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.199> angle<00:00:55.559> she<00:00:55.739> needs<00:00:55.980> to

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
back to learn the angle she needs to

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.049 
back to learn the angle she needs to
create<00:00:56.489> speed<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.270> direction<00:00:57.530> and<00:00:58.530> power<00:00:59.059> so

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
create speed and direction and power so

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.560 
create speed and direction and power so
this<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.510> jump<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.989> angle<00:01:01.350> flat<00:01:01.649> back<00:01:02.570> hundreds

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
this is jump to angle flat back hundreds

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.149 
this is jump to angle flat back hundreds
of<00:01:03.719> those<00:01:03.870> are<00:01:04.080> done<00:01:04.229> before<00:01:04.860> they<00:01:05.010> actually

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
of those are done before they actually

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.580 
of those are done before they actually
start<00:01:05.489> learning<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.119> flip<00:01:06.360> flop<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:07.350> would

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
start learning the flip flop that would

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.730 
start learning the flip flop that would
be<00:01:07.710> step<00:01:08.010> number<00:01:08.040> two<00:01:09.080> actually<00:01:10.080> that's<00:01:10.500> step

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
be step number two actually that's step

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.620 
be step number two actually that's step
number<00:01:10.770> one<00:01:11.040> step<00:01:11.790> number<00:01:11.850> two<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
number one step number two is the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.530 
number one step number two is the
handstand<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.409> step<00:01:14.010> number<00:01:14.040> three<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.610> jump

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
handstand and step number three is jump

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.050 
handstand and step number three is jump
handstand<00:01:16.290> snap<00:01:16.500> down<00:01:19.490> so<00:01:20.490> when<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.850> put

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
handstand snap down so when you put

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.910 
handstand snap down so when you put
those<00:01:21.210> three<00:01:21.509> together<00:01:21.720> first<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.619> jumped

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
those three together first the jumped

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.920 
those three together first the jumped
angle<00:01:23.250> flat<00:01:23.490> back<00:01:23.729> then<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.570> strong

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
angle flat back then the strong

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.840 
angle flat back then the strong
handstand<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.890> then<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.159> handstand<00:01:26.670> snap

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
handstand and then the handstand snap

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.350 
handstand and then the handstand snap
down<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:28.020> get<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.860> can<00:01:29.070> start<00:01:29.400> spotting<00:01:30.150> them

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
down you get you can start spotting them

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.830 
down you get you can start spotting them
to<00:01:30.990> go<00:01:31.110> jump<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.650> angle<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.460> handstand<00:01:32.840> one

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
to go jump to angle to the handstand one

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.789 
to go jump to angle to the handstand one
two<00:01:34.380> three<00:01:35.869> you<00:01:36.869> want<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.110> stop<00:01:37.380> here<00:01:37.770> you

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
two three you want to stop here you

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.350 
two three you want to stop here you
obviously<00:01:38.460> need<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.729> be<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.880> pretty<00:01:39.180> good

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
obviously need to be a pretty good

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.420 
obviously need to be a pretty good
spotter<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.930> be<00:01:40.049> able<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.350> do<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:41.009> then

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
spotter to be able to do this and then

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.889 
spotter to be able to do this and then
from<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:41.759> position<00:01:41.970> they'll<00:01:42.450> do<00:01:42.630> step

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
from this position they'll do step

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.109 
from this position they'll do step
number<00:01:42.930> three<00:01:43.409> which<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.979> snap<00:01:44.220> down<00:01:44.430> 1<00:01:44.820> 2

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
number three which is the snap down 1 2

3 snap ok once you've done that a lot of

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.649 
3 snap ok once you've done that a lot of
times<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.229> they're<00:01:49.320> hitting<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.619> good<00:01:49.799> angle

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
times and they're hitting a good angle

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.179 
times and they're hitting a good angle
and<00:01:50.749> they're<00:01:50.929> getting<00:01:51.380> a<00:01:51.560> good<00:01:51.710> handstand

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
and they're getting a good handstand

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:53.770 
and they're getting a good handstand
position<00:01:52.429> then<00:01:52.999> they're<00:01:53.149> able<00:01:53.270> to<00:01:53.450> do<00:01:53.630> the

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
position then they're able to do the

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.679 
position then they're able to do the
whole<00:01:53.929> thing<00:01:53.960> by<00:01:54.380> themselves<00:01:58.509> once<00:01:59.509> they

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
whole thing by themselves once they

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.510 
whole thing by themselves once they
learn<00:01:59.929> how<00:02:00.200> to<00:02:00.229> do<00:02:00.619> the<00:02:00.799> angles<00:02:01.250> in<00:02:01.429> the

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
learn how to do the angles in the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.090 
learn how to do the angles in the
flip-flop<00:02:02.030> single<00:02:02.840> like<00:02:03.439> this<00:02:03.740> and<00:02:04.039> they

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
flip-flop single like this and they

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.980 
flip-flop single like this and they
learn<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:04.340> angles<00:02:05.030> help<00:02:05.270> create<00:02:05.749> the

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
learn the angles help create the

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.619 
learn the angles help create the
rotation<00:02:06.679> and<00:02:07.269> direction<00:02:08.269> and<00:02:08.360> the<00:02:08.450> power

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 
rotation and direction and the power

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.539 
rotation and direction and the power
from<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:08.989> flip-flop<00:02:09.440> is<00:02:09.590> very<00:02:09.830> easily<00:02:10.129> to

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:10.549 
from the flip-flop is very easily to

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:12.580 
from the flip-flop is very easily to
turn<00:02:10.729> one<00:02:11.090> flip-flop<00:02:11.420> and<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:11.989> more<00:02:12.230> than<00:02:12.410> one

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
turn one flip-flop and the more than one

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.500 
turn one flip-flop and the more than one
we'll<00:02:12.799> show<00:02:12.950> you<00:02:12.980> one<00:02:13.310> more<00:02:13.340> and<00:02:13.849> then<00:02:14.269> she'll

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
we'll show you one more and then she'll

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.860 
we'll show you one more and then she'll
do<00:02:14.629> a<00:02:14.660> series<00:02:18.670> so<00:02:19.670> that<00:02:19.700> will<00:02:20.090> step<00:02:20.360> flip-flop

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
do a series so that will step flip-flop

do a series so that will step flip-flop
was<00:02:21.049> created<00:02:21.650> due<00:02:21.950> to<00:02:22.390> lots<00:02:23.390> of<00:02:23.599> repetitions

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
was created due to lots of repetitions

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.990 
was created due to lots of repetitions
of<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.620> three<00:02:24.890> steps<00:02:25.190> that<00:02:25.370> we<00:02:25.579> just<00:02:25.760> showed

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
of the three steps that we just showed

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.440 
of the three steps that we just showed
you

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
you

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.990 
you
very<00:02:27.049> good<00:02:27.319> spotting<00:02:27.709> and<00:02:28.069> once<00:02:28.519> you<00:02:28.700> can<00:02:28.879> do

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
very good spotting and once you can do

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.880 
very good spotting and once you can do
the<00:02:29.120> one<00:02:29.299> flip-flop<00:02:29.629> is<00:02:29.989> very<00:02:30.200> easy<00:02:30.470> to<00:02:30.709> turn

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
the one flip-flop is very easy to turn

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.890 
the one flip-flop is very easy to turn
it<00:02:31.069> in<00:02:31.160> to<00:02:31.370> more<00:02:31.549> than<00:02:31.760> one<00:02:31.970> so<00:02:32.299> go<00:02:32.480> down<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:32.840> do

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
it in to more than one so go down and do

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.349 
it in to more than one so go down and do
a<00:02:32.930> series
