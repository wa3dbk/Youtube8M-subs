00:01:49.860 --> 00:02:12.840
 name it is not but what 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:19.430
 by the way, what you do is the technique and 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.430

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.530
 no more details giving it 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.150
 measuring there is a bit of pressure on this 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.800

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.180

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.860
 careful try the discussion if 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:02.320
 wheels and that is because of the heating 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.330
 flows very well than obliquely 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.530
 state your music about missy is that the 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.550
 heating that state that there namely 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:12.490
