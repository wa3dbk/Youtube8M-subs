00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.170
 Oh 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.950
 released in 2010 reviewed in 2012 the best 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.879
 seller honda pcx 125 gets even better 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.489
 for 2014 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.020
 an aesthetic makeover a consumption 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.670
 still small and a crowd of small 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.680
 Practical details improving life on board 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.720
 and comfort contest to perfect this king 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.430
 already top cities 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.379
 the general line of pcx does not change 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.699
 basically for 2014 but the 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:56.920
 retouching brought him a 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.659
 look more dynamic optical blocks 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.460
 front and rear loop more sharp 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:02.199
 less black plastic for the benefit of 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.000
 the painted bodywork and adoption of a 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.500
 lighting exclusively entrusted to 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.790
 leds never seen until then on a 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.369
 scooter of this level of range 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.790
 he keeps his handlebars naked way of a 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.799
 roadster 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.010
 the finish is exemplary nothing 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:14.010
 exceeds 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.530
 hello they all face to learn 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.659
 the pcx 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.210
 allows the group to lengthen a little 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:29.330
 of wind had to circulate well on the 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.990
 scene whose backsplash was lifted on 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.680
 this version 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.200
 or when the still small bathroom 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.720
 worry since the scene is really very 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.150
 low leaving quiet at 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.440
 we are not really worried 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.440
 to watch 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.929
 comfort side we notice a saddle 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.200
 revised drawing and more materials 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:59.340
 qualitative statement of white stitching 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.229
 they now benefit from a 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.759
 restraint system that holds it open 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.840
 when we want to access the safe that 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.840
 always contains a full face helmet 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:19.200
 the passage is for its part benefits from 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:20.640
 wide retractable footrest stands 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:26.130
 notice immediately on the moment 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.930
 from 625 2014 this is the case bobos of which 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.500
 the graphics 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.200
 and more clear the speedometer is 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.379
 a little bigger and in the center 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:41.510
 we have a small digital screen with 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:43.799
 now the clock and the practical side 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.500
 average consumption 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.359
 what we appreciate in addition to news 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.079
 have made the painting is the appearance 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:54.989
 to see the right hand to practice 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:58.099
 in traffic where there is always 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.099
 no calls headlights 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.250
 the contactor is now black and not 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.180
 more metallic and the anti 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.790
 break-in closes automatically 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.140
 when we block the direction the screen 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.020
 digital technology is now taking place 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.310
 center of the analog speedometer 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.810
 original the eil of speed turns 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.490
 now around the outside of the 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.890
 circle and no longer has its base in the center 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.690
 finally left of the dashboard the 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.640
 glove box has been enlarged to 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.300
 drop a can and now hold 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.300
 a 12 volt socket 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.030
 besides and pc x2014 concerns the famous 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:40.160
 stop yvelines system that cuts the 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:43.890
 engine after three seconds we stop 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:47.330
 and that he immediately restarts the first 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.330
 of gas we start again 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.830
 to ride even longer without 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.600
 go to the pump the pc x2014 releases a 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.430
 tank of 8 liters instead of 6 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.600
 while the engine benefited the 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.570
 body of a reduction of friction 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.920
 internal 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.530
 we found a consumption of 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.280
 2.7 liters per cent instead of 2.8 on the 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.420
 previous model 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.420
 it link stop in action 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.840
 the single cylinder 4-stroke valve 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.310
 injection and liquid cooling 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.760
 retains the same power values 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.410
 and max torque 8.6 kilowatts and 12 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.500
 meters newtons but he reaches this couple 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.840
 at lower speed so you can 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.350
 low starts and failovers 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.750
 diet 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.750
 finally to make a strong lack 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:49.790
 level part cycle but nothing has changed 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:52.280
 no longer the pc x2014 which closes its 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:56.990
 wheels 14 inches 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:05:00.669
 and it's folded tightens the more gives that 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:04.340
 we so that perfectly combines 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:06.770
 stability and liveliness the pcx is 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.750
 really the king of traffic jams 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.930
 regret a little bit maybe 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:16.639
 we are concerned here nothing is not been a 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:19.789
 little bit relaxed but me it allows 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:22.270
 a nice rigor aspect 6 really 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:22.270
 high speed 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.810
 braking side 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:40.260
 nothing has changed still no abbey s 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:43.980
 but we keep 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:46.920
 born or left lever that 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:54.930
 good power on the back for 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:56.910
 prove runs up front the pc x2014 is 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.800
 more beautiful more modern more practical 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:01.260
 even less greedy and always more 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.190
 performers or a ranked global scooter 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.190
 among the low cost 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.630
 hat certainly to 2008 149 euros 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:09.570
 its official tariff is increasing 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:11.240
 of 250 euros must then enjoy 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.450
 immediately from the introductory price to 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.450
 2699 euros
