again using a project for a progress
capture<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.510> termination<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.860> sone

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:32.510 
capture the termination is a sone

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.619 
capture the termination is a sone
termination<00:00:33.510> on<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:33.809> cord<00:00:34.940> and<00:00:35.940> again<00:00:36.329> as<00:00:36.480> we

termination on this cord and again as we

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:39.169 
termination on this cord and again as we
take<00:00:36.870> up<00:00:37.079> we<00:00:37.980> can<00:00:38.160> see<00:00:38.339> this<00:00:38.489> progress<00:00:38.760> capture

00:00:39.169 --> 00:00:39.179 
take up we can see this progress capture

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:43.399 
take up we can see this progress capture
bumping<00:00:41.690> automatically<00:00:42.690> by<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.870> pulley

bumping automatically by the pulley

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:45.079 
bumping automatically by the pulley
we've<00:00:43.949> got<00:00:44.129> another<00:00:44.309> progress<00:00:44.699> capture<00:00:44.879> at

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:45.089 
we've got another progress capture at

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:46.579 
we've got another progress capture at
the<00:00:45.179> bottom<00:00:45.449> end<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:45.839> that<00:00:45.870> we<00:00:46.109> if<00:00:46.319> we<00:00:46.440> had<00:00:46.559> a

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:46.589 
the bottom end so that we if we had a

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:47.840 
the bottom end so that we if we had a
high<00:00:46.769> anchor<00:00:47.069> point<00:00:47.309> we<00:00:47.460> could<00:00:47.609> be<00:00:47.730> working

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
high anchor point we could be working

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.090 
high anchor point we could be working
with<00:00:48.089> that<00:00:48.300> from<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.539> base<00:00:48.859> I'm<00:00:49.859> going<00:00:50.039> to

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
with that from the base I'm going to

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.500 
with that from the base I'm going to
come<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:50.399> third<00:00:50.640> one<00:00:50.819> here<00:00:50.879> which<00:00:51.179> is<00:00:51.359> one

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
come to this third one here which is one

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.389 
come to this third one here which is one
that<00:00:51.600> I've<00:00:51.719> been<00:00:51.989> experimenting<00:00:52.679> recently

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
that I've been experimenting recently

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.319 
that I've been experimenting recently
experimenting<00:00:54.210> with<00:00:55.760> basically<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.940> same<00:00:57.149> as

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
experimenting with basically the same as

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.090 
experimenting with basically the same as
these<00:00:57.479> two<00:00:57.539> setups<00:00:57.929> except<00:00:58.440> for<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.739> couple<00:00:58.859> of

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
these two setups except for a couple of

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.290 
these two setups except for a couple of
differences<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.519> progress<00:00:59.879> capture<00:01:00.059> is

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
differences the progress capture is

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.559 
differences the progress capture is
built<00:01:00.510> into<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:00.870> pulley<00:01:02.239> so<00:01:03.239> scratching

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:03.569 
built into this pulley so scratching

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:06.200 
built into this pulley so scratching
past<00:01:04.019> here<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.500> can<00:01:04.650> let<00:01:04.830> go<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.250> can<00:01:05.969> put

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
past here and I can let go I can put

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.730 
past here and I can let go I can put
that<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.570> part<00:01:06.840> position<00:01:07.320> if<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.500> want<00:01:07.680> it

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
that to a part position if I want it

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.859 
that to a part position if I want it
free<00:01:07.979> running<00:01:08.219> or<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.240> can<00:01:09.540> just<00:01:09.570> have<00:01:09.840> it

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
free running or I can just have it

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.499 
free running or I can just have it
sitting<00:01:10.140> here<00:01:10.649> but<00:01:11.549> another<00:01:11.790> another<00:01:12.270> feature

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
sitting here but another another feature

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:14.359 
sitting here but another another feature
that<00:01:12.659> I've<00:01:12.840> set<00:01:13.380> up<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.710> system<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.189> you

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
that I've set up in the system that you

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.520 
that I've set up in the system that you
which<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.759> the<00:01:14.880> termination<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:16.350> the

up to two one pulling like this and then

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.240 
up to two one pulling like this and then
when<00:01:33.539> the<00:01:33.630> load<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:33.960> too<00:01:34.140> hard<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.469> pull<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.979> can

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
when the load is too hard to pull I can

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.219 
when the load is too hard to pull I can
let<00:01:35.399> go<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.640> one<00:01:35.789> of<00:01:35.909> those<00:01:35.969> strands<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.960> keep
