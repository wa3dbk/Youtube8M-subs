wood storage area and then you put six
inches<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.369> sand<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:39.000> then<00:01:39.479> another<00:01:39.810> three

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
inches of sand and then another three

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.710 
inches of sand and then another three

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
inches of concrete on top of that so

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.020 
inches of concrete on top of that so
you've<00:01:42.899> created<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.790> structurally<00:01:44.790> sound

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030

people actually they requested which I

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.120 
people actually they requested which I
thought<00:01:54.810> was<00:01:54.930> great<00:01:55.110> because<00:01:55.590> they<00:01:55.799> made<00:01:55.979> it

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
thought was great because they made it

and<00:01:56.340> if<00:01:56.430> they<00:01:56.549> install<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.030> then<00:01:57.210> I'm

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
and if they install it then I'm

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.069 
and if they install it then I'm

point I had to
and<00:02:12.740> consider<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.640> size<00:02:13.849> of<00:02:14.209> the<00:02:14.390> chimney

and consider the size of the chimney

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.410 
and consider the size of the chimney
that<00:02:14.720> we<00:02:14.930> needed<00:02:15.140> and<00:02:15.440> of<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.640> roof<00:02:16.970> slope

itself

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.960 
itself
I<00:02:18.110> wanted<00:02:18.440> it<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.680> mimic<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.160> winery<00:02:19.489> best<00:02:19.819> it

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
I wanted it to mimic the winery best it

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.240 
I wanted it to mimic the winery best it
could<00:02:20.180> but<00:02:20.420> being<00:02:21.380> so<00:02:21.590> small<00:02:21.920> it<00:02:22.160> was

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
could but being so small it was

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.640 
could but being so small it was
difficult<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:22.910> do<00:02:23.060> that<00:02:23.270> and<00:02:23.540> I<00:02:24.170> didn't<00:02:24.470> sleep

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
difficult to do that and I didn't sleep

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.530 
difficult to do that and I didn't sleep
one<00:02:24.890> night<00:02:24.920> because<00:02:25.520> I<00:02:25.550> thought<00:02:25.849> the<00:02:26.060> chimney

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
one night because I thought the chimney

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.650 
one night because I thought the chimney
it<00:02:26.720> was<00:02:26.900> too<00:02:27.140> large<00:02:27.380> but<00:02:28.360> once<00:02:29.360> it<00:02:29.540> was

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
it was too large but once it was

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.510 
it was too large but once it was
finished<00:02:29.870> off<00:02:30.200> with<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.620> texturing<00:02:31.040> it<00:02:31.250> just

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
finished off with the texturing it just

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.340 
finished off with the texturing it just
it<00:02:31.850> fell<00:02:32.150> right<00:02:32.180> into<00:02:32.510> place<00:02:32.600> and<00:02:33.050> it<00:02:33.140> looked

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
it fell right into place and it looked

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.670 
it fell right into place and it looked
dynamite<00:02:33.890> I<00:02:34.130> think<00:02:34.730> it's<00:02:34.850> neat<00:02:35.060> to<00:02:35.380> find<00:02:36.380> true

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
dynamite I think it's neat to find true

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.300 
dynamite I think it's neat to find true
craftsmen<00:02:37.280> that<00:02:37.310> can<00:02:37.610> mimic<00:02:38.180> old-world

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
craftsmen that can mimic old-world

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.160 
craftsmen that can mimic old-world
styles<00:02:40.310> and<00:02:40.610> to<00:02:41.120> actually<00:02:41.510> be<00:02:41.690> able<00:02:41.750> to<00:02:41.900> bring

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
styles and to actually be able to bring

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.199 
styles and to actually be able to bring
them<00:02:42.349> back<00:02:42.380> and<00:02:43.010> that's<00:02:43.190> I<00:02:43.489> think<00:02:43.580> a<00:02:43.910> dying

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
them back and that's I think a dying

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.320 
them back and that's I think a dying

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
George that we use he's done quite a bit

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.330 
George that we use he's done quite a bit
of<00:02:49.790> work<00:02:49.880> for<00:02:50.180> me<00:02:50.360> and<00:02:50.450> he's<00:02:51.200> just<00:02:51.680> perfect<00:02:51.890> I

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.630 
of work for me and he's just perfect I
can't<00:02:53.299> not<00:02:53.750> use<00:02:53.959> them<00:02:54.170> he<00:02:54.590> dips<00:02:54.860> it<00:02:55.069> into<00:02:55.340> the

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
can't not use them he dips it into the

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.309 
can't not use them he dips it into the
bucket<00:02:56.000> and<00:02:56.150> actually<00:02:56.540> just<00:02:56.810> kind<00:02:56.989> of<00:02:57.049> knocks

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
bucket and actually just kind of knocks

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.059 
bucket and actually just kind of knocks
it<00:02:57.530> over<00:02:57.769> his<00:02:57.980> arm<00:02:58.190> and<00:02:58.810> all<00:02:59.810> sudden<00:03:00.230> before

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
it over his arm and all sudden before

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:02.470 
it over his arm and all sudden before
you<00:03:01.160> know<00:03:01.280> it<00:03:01.370> it<00:03:01.459> looks<00:03:01.640> exactly<00:03:01.819> like<00:03:02.180> the

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
you know it it looks exactly like the

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.759 
you know it it looks exactly like the
outside<00:03:02.900> of<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.080> liner<00:03:03.290> here<00:03:03.500> and<00:03:03.620> it's<00:03:03.739> just

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
outside of the liner here and it's just

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.820 
outside of the liner here and it's just
amazing<00:03:04.190> to<00:03:04.459> me<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:05.420> key<00:03:05.630> is<00:03:05.840> to<00:03:06.049> buy<00:03:06.200> the<00:03:06.260> oven

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
amazing to me the key is to buy the oven

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.460 
amazing to me the key is to buy the oven
a<00:03:07.310> good<00:03:07.940> quality<00:03:08.269> oven<00:03:08.569> in<00:03:08.690> which<00:03:08.720> case<00:03:09.049> we<00:03:09.290> did

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
a good quality oven in which case we did

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.930 
a good quality oven in which case we did
here<00:03:09.799> and<00:03:09.980> I<00:03:10.040> think<00:03:10.100> that's<00:03:10.430> probably<00:03:10.700> the

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
here and I think that's probably the

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.940 
here and I think that's probably the
biggest<00:03:11.180> thing<00:03:11.630> everything<00:03:12.319> else<00:03:12.500> is<00:03:12.769> really

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
biggest thing everything else is really

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.220 
biggest thing everything else is really
just<00:03:13.280> construction<00:03:13.760> and<00:03:14.060> and<00:03:14.180> simple<00:03:14.569> you<00:03:15.049> can

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
just construction and and simple you can

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.990 
just construction and and simple you can
enclose<00:03:15.500> it<00:03:15.739> in<00:03:15.769> wood<00:03:16.010> people<00:03:16.670> put<00:03:16.910> them

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
enclose it in wood people put them

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.920 
enclose it in wood people put them
inside<00:03:17.150> now

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
inside now

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.330 
inside now
so<00:03:18.109> there's<00:03:18.350> often<00:03:18.739> times<00:03:18.890> when<00:03:19.220> you're

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340
