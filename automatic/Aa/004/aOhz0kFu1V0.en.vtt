00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 So that's it , guys, let's start the 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.120
 our classes 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:10.469
 Let's drive here through the city. Let's see. 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.969
 how is our practice is not 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.950
 That's it, guys. Let's start here. 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.720
 our class 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.490
 we have to call here at our lighthouse was 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.699
 notified no 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.830
 here he has to turn right 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:29.970
 which gives preference to those who are already 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:35.579
 neighboring galicia let's continue here 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:39.920
 our route we must follow that 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.920
 map litter on top right 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.980
 here the soul at maximum speed 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:50.120
 allowed is 60 miles per hour 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.120
 so let's go here 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.490
 Let's give preference to those who are already 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.920
 at the traffic circle there is no one coming 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.920
 so let's continue here 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:10.170
 how to turn the lights on 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.170
 Right and let's get in here. 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.720
 That's it guys, let's continue here. 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.720
 here more class 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.550
 here we should turn left to look 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.870
 the rearview mirror to see if it is not 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:36.270
 there is no one behind and only then go here 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.450
 have concluded that our maneuver to 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.500
 turn left and we will see if you do not have 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.240
 no pedestrians passing the catwalk 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.930
 Let's get here on the left lane and 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.120
 Let's come here on our next or 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.930
 fifth of our class 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:59.100
 that's it we had a sign over there 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.440
 behind forbidden overtaking 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.300
 here we also have a continuous track 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.300
 Continuous can not exceed 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.880
 let's turn right 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.180
 let's look and if there is not 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.380
 no one should give preference not 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.450
 is seeing nobody 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.960
 So let's get in here in our 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.960
 terran 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:54.680
 to boost my son, I just warned you 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:57.740
 that existed in the crazy bank are neither 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:02.230
 there crosses in front of the face this 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:05.540
 focus assistant so I prefer to play and 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.510
 defensive than or avoid empty 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.610
 crash out let's start here one 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:15.620
 we will give preference to 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:18.460
 who is already in it we go to the citizen can 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.460
 my son 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:31.099
 Boot so much old bastard and there you 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:35.870
 decides in our galley also that if not 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:38.510
 decide old if you conclude that it will not 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:44.989
 Can my son also? 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:52.670
 the tip is good you guys then 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:55.010
 gotcha with milan only can the guy 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.010
 Do you want to be good still the ticket to him? 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:01.250
 going out is just this joke and it gets 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:10.129
 training people, then turn the flash 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:13.519
 holy intention there is not come here beauty 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:17.650
 Let's continue here on our route. 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:19.449
 here to finish our class 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.540
 which is very important this class that 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:25.120
 make practice of walking in traffic 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:28.060
 respect the plates respecting the 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:32.340
 the signs using blinkers 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.340
 This is very important. 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:39.749
 now we must stop here our end 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:44.249
 Let's turn the flash on the right and let's go 

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:46.289
 approaching we may seem to 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:50.520
 It does not have to come to the end but only 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:53.819
 So far pulling the brake does not know that it has 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:58.710
 who make a mark who does not let 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:05:01.650
 do more ahead and I ended up squeezing 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:04.289
 without wanting to put the 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:08.300
 then start here at 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:08.300
 our front beacon 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:15.550
 Mother looking back with rear view mirror 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.550
 he had even forgotten 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.100
 Ready we have alignment here quickly. 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.900
 beauty 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:50.550
 That 's when the engine is turned off and we conclude 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.020
 here to our half-beacon that 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.940
 It did not work 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.610
 we go there we finished we did 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.460
 alignment we do not beat that it's important 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:02.360
 and we are going to finish this class here and we are going 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.360
 start another
