the<00:00:11.099> first<00:00:11.309> one<00:00:11.460> here<00:00:11.670> we've<00:00:11.790> got<00:00:11.820> is<00:00:12.090> from

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
the first one here we've got is from

the first one here we've got is from
nuketown<00:00:12.750> 2025<00:00:13.910> so<00:00:14.910> I<00:00:15.299> think<00:00:15.570> this<00:00:15.719> was

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
nuketown 2025 so I think this was

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.320 
nuketown 2025 so I think this was
released<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.740> little<00:00:16.949> while<00:00:17.220> ago<00:00:17.400> from<00:00:18.119> when

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
released a little while ago from when

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.060 
released a little while ago from when
they<00:00:18.480> announced<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:19.260> there<00:00:19.590> would<00:00:19.680> also<00:00:19.859> be

a<00:00:20.189> double<00:00:20.550> XP<00:00:20.880> weekend<00:00:21.480> I'm<00:00:22.020> not<00:00:22.170> sure<00:00:22.230> if<00:00:22.410> the

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
a double XP weekend I'm not sure if the

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:23.660 
a double XP weekend I'm not sure if the
weekend<00:00:22.859> actually<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.279> think<00:00:23.400> it's<00:00:23.640> just

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
the weekend after the release but I

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.830 
the weekend after the release but I
really<00:00:35.280> don't<00:00:35.640> know<00:00:35.700> about<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:36.059> so<00:00:36.480> nothing

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
really don't know about that so nothing

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.889 
really don't know about that so nothing
really<00:00:36.870> interesting<00:00:37.860> in<00:00:37.980> here<00:00:38.280> other<00:00:39.270> than<00:00:39.450> it

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
really interesting in here other than it

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.810 
really interesting in here other than it
doesn't<00:00:40.290> look<00:00:40.410> futuristic<00:00:40.860> although<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.670> says

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
doesn't look futuristic although it says

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.150 
doesn't look futuristic although it says
greetings<00:00:42.090> from<00:00:42.420> 2025<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.559> do<00:00:43.620> believe<00:00:43.950> that

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
greetings from 2025 I do believe that

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.479 
greetings from 2025 I do believe that
they've<00:00:44.340> made<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:44.670> map<00:00:45.260> using<00:00:46.260> old<00:00:46.800> retro

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
they've made this map using old retro

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.400 
they've made this map using old retro
kind<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.420> 70s<00:00:50.539> cause<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.840> stuff<00:00:52.020> although

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
kind of 70s cause and stuff although

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.229 
kind of 70s cause and stuff although
this<00:00:52.620> bus<00:00:52.860> does<00:00:53.160> look<00:00:53.460> quite<00:00:53.699> interesting

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
this bus does look quite interesting

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.170 
this bus does look quite interesting
with<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.930> wheels<00:00:55.170> being<00:00:55.620> covered<00:00:56.039> fully<00:00:56.789> by

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
with the wheels being covered fully by

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.599 
with the wheels being covered fully by
this<00:00:57.390> by<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.020> metal<00:00:58.320> by<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.530> actual<00:00:58.920> bus<00:00:59.250> and

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
this by the metal by the actual bus and

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.430 
this by the metal by the actual bus and
then<00:01:00.120> this<00:01:00.210> front<00:01:00.510> one<00:01:00.719> has<00:01:00.960> an<00:01:01.079> opening<00:01:01.379> like

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
then this front one has an opening like

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.039 
then this front one has an opening like
a<00:01:01.949> normal<00:01:02.399> one<00:01:02.550> would<00:01:02.850> but<00:01:03.660> these<00:01:03.780> are<00:01:03.930> two

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
a normal one would but these are two

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.219 
a normal one would but these are two
locked<00:01:04.589> off<00:01:04.769> at<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.250> really<00:01:05.640> don't<00:01:05.729> know<00:01:05.880> if

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
locked off at I really don't know if

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.480 
locked off at I really don't know if
buses<00:01:07.229> back<00:01:07.350> then<00:01:07.560> actually<00:01:07.979> did<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.310> they

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
buses back then actually did that they

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.660 
buses back then actually did that they
probably<00:01:08.670> did<00:01:10.040> looking<00:01:11.040> at<00:01:11.130> just<00:01:11.250> something

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
probably did looking at just something

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.289 
probably did looking at just something
out<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.450> ordinary<00:01:12.479> kind<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.320> um<00:01:14.280> but<00:01:15.090> yeah

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
out of the ordinary kind of um but yeah

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.880 
out of the ordinary kind of um but yeah
doesn't<00:01:16.080> look<00:01:16.170> like<00:01:16.229> they've<00:01:16.500> gone<00:01:16.650> with<00:01:16.860> a

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
doesn't look like they've gone with a

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.700 
doesn't look like they've gone with a
futuristic<00:01:17.490> approach<00:01:18.030> with<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:18.689> part<00:01:19.530> that

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
futuristic approach with this part that

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.830 
futuristic approach with this part that
they've<00:01:19.860> shared<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.250> map<00:01:20.430> anyway<00:01:20.909> or<00:01:21.299> it

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
they've shared the map anyway or it

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.510 
they've shared the map anyway or it
could<00:01:22.049> not<00:01:22.320> even<00:01:22.439> be<00:01:22.710> in-game<00:01:22.920> footage<00:01:23.250> you

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
could not even be in-game footage you

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.190 
could not even be in-game footage you
could<00:01:23.700> just<00:01:23.880> be<00:01:24.000> some<00:01:24.180> artwork<00:01:24.600> but<00:01:24.840> i<00:01:24.900> think

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
could just be some artwork but i think

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.249 
could just be some artwork but i think
it<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.560> game<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:27.240> next<00:01:27.330> image<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.810> from<00:01:27.990> the

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
it is in game the next image is from the

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.819 
it is in game the next image is from the
first<00:01:29.509> forgot<00:01:30.509> what<00:01:30.570> they<00:01:30.689> call<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:30.990> now<00:01:31.170> bus

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
first forgot what they call it now bus

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.670 
first forgot what they call it now bus
drop-off<00:01:32.310> i<00:01:32.520> think<00:01:32.729> they<00:01:32.850> called<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.680> which

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
drop-off i think they called it which

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.380 
drop-off i think they called it which
they'll<00:01:35.250> be<00:01:35.369> releasing<00:01:35.880> every<00:01:35.970> day<00:01:36.180> this<00:01:36.329> week

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
they'll be releasing every day this week

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.390 
they'll be releasing every day this week
up<00:01:36.840> until<00:01:36.960> friday<00:01:37.470> i<00:01:37.619> think<00:01:37.979> where<00:01:38.250> they'll

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
up until friday i think where they'll

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.590 
up until friday i think where they'll
eventually<00:01:39.110> release<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.470> new<00:01:41.299> gameplay<00:01:42.299> that's

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
eventually release a new gameplay that's

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.929 
eventually release a new gameplay that's
never<00:01:42.780> been<00:01:42.960> seen<00:01:43.200> before<00:01:43.340> so<00:01:44.340> firstly<00:01:44.670> that's

actually<00:02:00.030> we<00:02:00.210> don't<00:02:00.360> even<00:02:00.450> know<00:02:00.600> if<00:02:00.630> these

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
actually we don't even know if these

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.520 
actually we don't even know if these
images<00:02:01.229> were<00:02:01.530> from<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.009> campaign<00:02:03.229> the<00:02:04.229> images

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
images were from the campaign the images

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.520 
images were from the campaign the images
are<00:02:04.590> released<00:02:04.979> prior<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.549> trailer<00:02:05.880> so

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
are released prior to the trailer so

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.960 
are released prior to the trailer so
they<00:02:07.530> could<00:02:07.710> be<00:02:07.799> from<00:02:07.979> one<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.459> individual

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
they could be from one of the individual

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.270 
they could be from one of the individual
maps<00:02:09.149> with<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.509> original<00:02:09.660> characters<00:02:10.289> so

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
maps with the original characters so

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.040 
maps with the original characters so
we're<00:02:12.209> just<00:02:12.270> going<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.510> have<00:02:12.600> to<00:02:12.660> wait<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:13.020> see

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
we're just going to have to wait and see

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.270 
we're just going to have to wait and see
but<00:02:13.350> Friday<00:02:13.650> there<00:02:13.950> will<00:02:14.100> be

never-before-seen gameplay released so

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.980 
never-before-seen gameplay released so
this<00:02:17.190> is<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.370> first<00:02:17.700> bus<00:02:18.150> drop-off<00:02:18.660> I'm

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
this is the first bus drop-off I'm

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.860 
this is the first bus drop-off I'm
pretty<00:02:19.290> sure<00:02:19.440> all<00:02:19.680> up<00:02:20.160> until<00:02:20.700> Friday<00:02:21.180> they'll

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
pretty sure all up until Friday they'll

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.660 
pretty sure all up until Friday they'll
just<00:02:22.080> be<00:02:22.230> releasing<00:02:22.650> screenshots<00:02:23.220> like<00:02:23.430> this

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
just be releasing screenshots like this

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.540 
just be releasing screenshots like this
but<00:02:24.090> yeah<00:02:24.630> so<00:02:25.319> basically<00:02:25.560> what<00:02:26.100> you<00:02:26.190> can<00:02:26.310> see

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
but yeah so basically what you can see

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.300 
but yeah so basically what you can see
here<00:02:26.580> is<00:02:27.209> looks<00:02:28.200> like<00:02:28.350> someone's<00:02:28.680> try<00:02:28.980> to<00:02:29.040> use

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
here is looks like someone's try to use

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.190 
here is looks like someone's try to use
a<00:02:29.340> car<00:02:29.700> battery<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:30.330> power<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:31.350> small<00:02:32.280> light

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
a car battery to power a small light

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.550 
a car battery to power a small light
which<00:02:34.200> doesn't<00:02:34.590> really<00:02:34.680> make<00:02:34.950> sense<00:02:36.290> it's<00:02:37.290> a

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
which doesn't really make sense it's a

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.740 
which doesn't really make sense it's a
little<00:02:37.830> bit<00:02:37.980> confusing<00:02:38.430> but<00:02:39.209> they've<00:02:39.390> used<00:02:39.569> to

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
little bit confusing but they've used to

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.420 
little bit confusing but they've used to
jumper<00:02:40.080> cables<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:40.620> on<00:02:40.739> they<00:02:41.069> haven't

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
jumper cables and on they haven't

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.550 
jumper cables and on they haven't
directly<00:02:41.670> connected<00:02:42.600> them<00:02:42.780> instead<00:02:43.290> they've

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
directly connected them instead they've

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.470 
directly connected them instead they've
kind<00:02:44.040> of<00:02:44.130> got<00:02:44.310> different<00:02:44.580> wires<00:02:44.880> leading<00:02:45.180> to

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
kind of got different wires leading to

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.240 
kind of got different wires leading to
it<00:02:45.660> so<00:02:46.200> I'm<00:02:46.290> not<00:02:46.440> sure<00:02:46.620> if<00:02:46.709> that<00:02:46.739> has<00:02:46.950> anything

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
it so I'm not sure if that has anything

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.320 
it so I'm not sure if that has anything
to<00:02:47.430> do<00:02:47.640> with<00:02:47.670> anything<00:02:47.940> but<00:02:48.860> maybe<00:02:50.180> one<00:02:51.180> of<00:02:51.209> the

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
to do with anything but maybe one of the

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.699 
to do with anything but maybe one of the
things<00:02:51.480> I<00:02:51.600> was<00:02:51.630> thinking<00:02:51.989> about<00:02:52.170> is<00:02:52.380> maybe<00:02:52.560> you

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
things I was thinking about is maybe you

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.560 
things I was thinking about is maybe you
don't<00:02:52.800> have<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.100> turn<00:02:53.280> on<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.550> power<00:02:53.820> to<00:02:54.540> be

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
don't have to turn on the power to be

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.800 
don't have to turn on the power to be
able<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:55.019> use<00:02:55.170> perks<00:02:55.910> so<00:02:56.910> maybe<00:02:57.150> you<00:02:57.300> pick<00:02:57.630> this

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
able to use perks so maybe you pick this

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.960 
able to use perks so maybe you pick this
little<00:02:58.140> guy<00:02:58.260> off<00:02:58.530> floor<00:02:59.040> or<00:02:59.400> get<00:02:59.730> it<00:02:59.819> from

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
little guy off floor or get it from

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.229 
little guy off floor or get it from
mystery<00:03:00.420> box<00:03:00.660> and<00:03:01.220> maybe<00:03:02.220> you<00:03:02.459> can<00:03:02.730> somehow

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
mystery box and maybe you can somehow

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.080 
mystery box and maybe you can somehow
attach<00:03:03.840> it<00:03:04.110> to<00:03:04.140> a<00:03:04.290> perk<00:03:04.620> machine<00:03:05.100> and<00:03:05.430> it'll

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
attach it to a perk machine and it'll

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.750 
attach it to a perk machine and it'll
power<00:03:06.360> it<00:03:06.600> on<00:03:06.720> for<00:03:07.170> maybe<00:03:07.980> five<00:03:08.280> seconds<00:03:08.700> or

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
power it on for maybe five seconds or

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.150 
power it on for maybe five seconds or
something<00:03:09.000> so<00:03:09.120> you<00:03:09.150> can<00:03:09.330> buy<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.510> perk<00:03:10.040> maybe<00:03:11.040> it

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
something so you can buy a perk maybe it

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.790 
something so you can buy a perk maybe it
uses<00:03:11.519> points<00:03:11.970> to<00:03:12.690> actually<00:03:13.110> work<00:03:13.380> because

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
uses points to actually work because

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.009 
uses points to actually work because
well<00:03:14.550> maybe<00:03:14.730> it's<00:03:14.910> got<00:03:15.030> a<00:03:15.060> limited<00:03:15.480> amount<00:03:15.690> of

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
well maybe it's got a limited amount of

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.370 
well maybe it's got a limited amount of
uses<00:03:16.820> no<00:03:17.820> because<00:03:18.060> it<00:03:18.269> certainly<00:03:18.450> got<00:03:18.780> what's

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
uses no because it certainly got what's

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.130 
uses no because it certainly got what's
in<00:03:19.560> that<00:03:19.680> small<00:03:20.160> battery<00:03:20.930> again<00:03:21.930> we<00:03:22.049> don't

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
in that small battery again we don't

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.930 
in that small battery again we don't
know<00:03:22.320> how<00:03:22.410> big<00:03:22.650> this<00:03:22.829> battery<00:03:23.190> actually<00:03:23.430> is

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
know how big this battery actually is

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.640 
know how big this battery actually is
I'm<00:03:24.360> pretty<00:03:24.570> sure<00:03:24.690> it<00:03:24.810> is<00:03:24.930> small<00:03:25.200> because<00:03:25.350> of

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
I'm pretty sure it is small because of

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.590 
I'm pretty sure it is small because of
the<00:03:25.739> size<00:03:25.950> of<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.100> jump<00:03:26.370> cables<00:03:26.820> so<00:03:27.329> it's<00:03:27.480> just

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
the size of the jump cables so it's just

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.410 
the size of the jump cables so it's just
a<00:03:27.690> normal<00:03:27.930> car<00:03:28.290> battery<00:03:28.620> or<00:03:29.150> like<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.269> ones

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
a normal car battery or like the ones

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.240 
a normal car battery or like the ones
