00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.670
 dear ladies and gentlemen, I have now set 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:11.690
 here come 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:13.790
 Ben and I can say that this is a complete mess 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.400
 as 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.150
 and this is supposed to be a button which 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.750
 name is 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.750
 and now we see what happens 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.489
 as you can see working on me but now 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.970
 it is worth pressing this button turns on 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:35.970
 turbine 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.560
 and he begins to stall but 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.770
 this is how you can understand idle 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:53.440
 momentum so I will add them now to 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:58.350
 normal and look with you further 5 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.350
 seconds awkwardly not enough 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:15.130
 as you can see the turbine is completely 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:18.130
 completely kills the bike at all 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.130
 five 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:29.090
 we can repeat the experiment again I give 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.090
 turnovers 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:38.780
 and turbines it suppresses than even the wilderness 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:44.510
 probably faster than if he was jammed 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:48.800
 with the key so I can say that it is 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:52.040
 just a rare shit but soon 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.480
 there will be less test drive yet 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.990
 opportunities to leave 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:02:03.730
 since the clutch is covered but I think 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.730
 you are already satisfied thank you bye
