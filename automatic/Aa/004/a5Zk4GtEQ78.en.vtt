lot<00:00:56.520> more<00:00:56.640> enemies<00:00:56.969> at<00:00:57.120> once<00:00:57.149> it's<00:00:58.050> really

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
lot more enemies at once it's really

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.389 
lot more enemies at once it's really
hard<00:00:58.440> if<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.620> don't<00:00:58.739> have<00:00:58.859> heat<00:00:58.980> sink<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.309> get

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
hard if you don't have heat sink to get

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.979 
hard if you don't have heat sink to get
more<00:00:59.520> than<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.699> double<00:00:59.969> kill<00:01:00.149> but<00:01:00.780> with<00:01:00.899> you

more than a double kill but with you

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.119 
more than a double kill but with you
think<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.289> could<00:01:01.379> easily<00:01:01.680> get<00:01:01.770> four<00:01:02.010> people

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
think you could easily get four people

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.979 
think you could easily get four people
at<00:01:02.340> once<00:01:02.489> five<00:01:02.730> people<00:01:03.030> at<00:01:03.090> once<00:01:03.300> without<00:01:03.719> your

pretty easy to unlock both of those in

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.020 
pretty easy to unlock both of those in
one<00:01:19.259> game<00:01:19.500> which<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.159> really<00:01:20.460> nice<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.729> then

which seems just to target you across
the<00:02:03.420> map<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.840> that's<00:02:04.170> really<00:02:04.229> annoying<00:02:04.560> to

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
the map and that's really annoying to

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.620 
the map and that's really annoying to
die<00:02:04.860> by<00:02:05.040> centuries<00:02:05.460> now<00:02:05.909> down<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.420> tier

you<00:02:36.160> have<00:02:36.250> a<00:02:36.280> little<00:02:36.459> bit<00:02:36.550> more<00:02:36.670> speed<00:02:36.880> like

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
you have a little bit more speed like

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.970 
you have a little bit more speed like
again<00:02:37.660> i<00:02:37.690> said<00:02:38.080> you<00:02:38.380> get<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.620> compete<00:02:38.830> with

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
again i said you get to compete with

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.800 
again i said you get to compete with
those<00:02:39.070> SMG<00:02:39.490> is<00:02:39.550> a<00:02:39.580> little<00:02:39.730> easier<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:40.240> you<00:02:40.270> get

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
those SMG is a little easier and you get

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.000 
those SMG is a little easier and you get
to<00:02:40.900> just<00:02:41.050> run<00:02:41.140> around<00:02:41.230> these<00:02:41.440> new<00:02:41.560> maps<00:02:41.680> cap

objectives you know get dog tags things
like<00:02:44.410> that<00:02:44.560> so<00:02:44.830> that's<00:02:45.190> always<00:02:45.400> a<00:02:45.550> great

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
like that so that's always a great

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.310 
like that so that's always a great
ability<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.270> throw<00:02:46.420> one<00:02:46.600> and<00:02:46.840> now<00:02:46.989> onto<00:02:47.200> the

score<00:02:47.620> streaks<00:02:47.890> I<00:02:48.070> go<00:02:48.190> ahead<00:02:48.280> and<00:02:48.370> prefer<00:02:48.700> UAV

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
score streaks I go ahead and prefer UAV

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.420 
score streaks I go ahead and prefer UAV
in<00:02:49.630> system<00:02:50.140> half<00:02:50.290> I<00:02:50.500> don't<00:02:51.040> like<00:02:51.070> writing<00:02:51.340> the

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
in system half I don't like writing the

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.680 
in system half I don't like writing the
bigger<00:02:51.580> score<00:02:51.850> streak<00:02:52.060> because<00:02:52.390> it<00:02:52.510> seems

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
bigger score streak because it seems

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.120 
bigger score streak because it seems
when<00:02:52.810> I<00:02:52.840> call<00:02:53.050> it<00:02:53.140> a<00:02:53.200> warbird<00:02:53.590> or<00:02:53.860> anything

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
when I call it a warbird or anything

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.890 
when I call it a warbird or anything
like<00:02:54.160> that<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.850> enemies<00:02:55.120> instantly<00:02:55.510> back<00:02:55.660> out

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
like that the enemies instantly back out

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.270 
like that the enemies instantly back out
and<00:02:56.110> I<00:02:56.200> hate<00:02:56.320> having<00:02:56.590> to<00:02:56.620> play<00:02:56.680> a<00:02:56.800> game<00:02:56.890> against
