look<00:00:18.119> here<00:00:18.390> you<00:00:18.480> see<00:00:18.630> this<00:00:18.750> rubber<00:00:18.960> case<00:00:19.260> on

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
look here you see this rubber case on

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.439 
look here you see this rubber case on
top<00:00:19.740> sitting<00:00:20.640> around<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.000> back<00:00:21.180> you<00:00:21.210> can

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
top sitting around to the back you can

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.929 
top sitting around to the back you can
see<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.660> metal<00:00:21.900> backing<00:00:22.670> so<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.760> case

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
see the metal backing so the case

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.910 
see the metal backing so the case
actually<00:00:24.269> serves<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.600> couple<00:00:24.750> purposes<00:00:24.930> when

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
actually serves a couple purposes when

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.620 
actually serves a couple purposes when
it's<00:00:26.070> on<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.340> keyword<00:00:27.119> shuts<00:00:27.480> off

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
it's on the keyword shuts off

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.700

here's<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.099> keyboard<00:00:32.610> pretty

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
here's the keyboard pretty

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.450 
here's the keyboard pretty
straightforward<00:00:33.239> design<00:00:33.630> here<00:00:34.280> then<00:00:35.280> the

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
straightforward design here then the

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.060 
straightforward design here then the
case<00:00:35.700> also<00:00:36.210> doubles<00:00:36.600> as<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:37.110> stand<00:00:37.500> for<00:00:38.040> a

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
case also doubles as a stand for a

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.910 
case also doubles as a stand for a
tablet<00:00:40.969> so<00:00:41.969> I've<00:00:42.030> got<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.210> sample<00:00:42.620> iPad<00:00:43.620> here

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
tablet so I've got a sample iPad here

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.500 
tablet so I've got a sample iPad here
works<00:00:44.550> in<00:00:44.700> landscape<00:00:46.850> portrait<00:00:47.850> mode<00:00:48.270> and

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
works in landscape portrait mode and

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.060 
works in landscape portrait mode and
what's<00:00:49.140> nice<00:00:49.289> about<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:49.829> the

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
what's nice about it is that the

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.500 
what's nice about it is that the
keyboard<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.430> Bluetooth<00:00:50.820> so<00:00:51.059> it'll<00:00:51.239> work<00:00:51.390> with

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
keyboard is Bluetooth so it'll work with

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.790 
keyboard is Bluetooth so it'll work with
pretty<00:00:51.780> much<00:00:51.930> anything<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.320> supports

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
pretty much anything that supports

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.130 
pretty much anything that supports
Bluetooth<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.969> stand<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.510> designed<00:00:54.960> so

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
Bluetooth and the stand is designed so

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.240 
Bluetooth and the stand is designed so
that<00:00:55.170> will<00:00:55.320> work<00:00:55.350> with<00:00:55.620> pretty<00:00:55.829> much<00:00:55.949> any

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
that will work with pretty much any

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.279 
that will work with pretty much any
tablet<00:00:56.940> as<00:00:57.059> well<00:00:57.270> as<00:00:57.390> any<00:00:57.510> tablet<00:00:57.930> with<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.050> case

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
tablet as well as any tablet with a case

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.889 
tablet as well as any tablet with a case
on<00:00:58.699> so<00:00:59.699> for<00:00:59.879> the<00:00:59.940> keyboard<00:01:00.239> itself<00:01:00.719> it's

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
on so for the keyboard itself it's

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.479 
on so for the keyboard itself it's
actually<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.199> pretty<00:01:01.530> small<00:01:01.890> design<00:01:02.190> compared

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
actually a pretty small design compared

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.759 
actually a pretty small design compared
to<00:01:02.550> other<00:01:02.670> mobile<00:01:02.879> keyboards<00:01:03.480> but<00:01:04.409> still<00:01:04.650> it's

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
to other mobile keyboards but still it's

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.130 
to other mobile keyboards but still it's
pretty<00:01:04.949> satisfying<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.700> type<00:01:05.939> on<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.659> has<00:01:07.110> a

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
pretty satisfying to type on it has a

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.719 
pretty satisfying to type on it has a
nice<00:01:07.380> sturdy<00:01:07.710> feel<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.310> when<00:01:08.490> it's<00:01:08.610> on<00:01:08.700> a

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
nice sturdy feel to it when it's on a

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.750 
nice sturdy feel to it when it's on a
desk<00:01:09.049> keys<00:01:10.049> are<00:01:10.170> nice<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.500> responsive<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:11.700> the

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
desk keys are nice and responsive so the

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.190 
desk keys are nice and responsive so the
keyboard<00:01:12.090> gets<00:01:12.240> his<00:01:12.360> name<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:12.540> part<00:01:12.900> from<00:01:13.049> this

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
keyboard gets his name in part from this

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.020 
keyboard gets his name in part from this
wedge<00:01:13.500> on<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.799> bottom<00:01:14.130> side<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.640> serves
