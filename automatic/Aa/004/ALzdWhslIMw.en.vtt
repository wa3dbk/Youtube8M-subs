one that we sort of found I guess I was

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.720

people<00:00:15.089> but<00:00:15.299> I<00:00:15.540> was<00:00:16.260> quite<00:00:16.440> fortunate<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.949> get

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
people but I was quite fortunate to get

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.179 
people but I was quite fortunate to get
from<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.279> legit<00:00:17.520> TT<00:00:17.789> he<00:00:18.359> managed<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:18.980> let<00:00:19.980> me

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
from a legit TT he managed to let me

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.730 
from a legit TT he managed to let me
show<00:00:20.910> case<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.510> he<00:00:22.320> managed<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.619> get

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
show case it and he managed to get

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.950 
show case it and he managed to get
himself<00:00:22.949> so<00:00:23.430> this<00:00:24.150> comparison<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.779> pretty

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
himself so this comparison is pretty

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.279 
himself so this comparison is pretty
much<00:00:25.279> thanks<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.369> him<00:00:26.490> but<00:00:26.760> basically<00:00:27.480> you

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
essentially it's uh should be available

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.360 
essentially it's uh should be available
in<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.230> next<00:00:34.380> highest<00:00:34.620> coming<00:00:34.920> out<00:00:35.010> as<00:00:35.130> sort

atrocious put it that way the rail wants

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.729 
atrocious put it that way the rail wants

to stick her all the time horrible
traction<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:54.000> doesn't<00:00:54.270> want<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.480> turn

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
traction and it doesn't want to turn

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.350 
traction and it doesn't want to turn
even<00:00:54.840> though<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.110> brake<00:00:55.410> like<00:00:55.770> 100<00:00:56.399> miles<00:00:56.520> 100

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
even though you brake like 100 miles 100

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.510 
even though you brake like 100 miles 100
miles<00:00:57.539> back<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.989> know<00:00:58.140> North<00:00:58.800> Korea<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.250> you

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
miles back you know North Korea and you

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.979 
miles back you know North Korea and you
can't<00:00:59.730> have<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.879> turn<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.329> American<00:01:00.780> cities

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
can't have a turn in to American cities

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.599 
can't have a turn in to American cities
it<00:01:01.170> doesn't<00:01:01.379> really<00:01:01.469> make<00:01:01.649> sense<00:01:01.890> but<00:01:02.160> look<00:01:02.370> we

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
it doesn't really make sense but look we

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.810 
it doesn't really make sense but look we
have<00:01:03.110> we<00:01:04.110> have<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.890> loss<00:01:05.070> slamming<00:01:05.460> our<00:01:05.580> hands

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
have we have the loss slamming our hands

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.359 
have we have the loss slamming our hands
got<00:01:06.060> insane<00:01:06.420> traction

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
got insane traction

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.280 
got insane traction
that's<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.490> insurrection<00:01:08.729> but<00:01:09.270> it's<00:01:10.020> do<00:01:10.140> it

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
that's it insurrection but it's do it

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.440 
that's it insurrection but it's do it
does<00:01:10.650> tend<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.040> lose<00:01:11.490> rare<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:11.939> little<00:01:12.240> bit<00:01:12.360> but

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
does tend to lose rare a little bit but

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.730 
does tend to lose rare a little bit but
it's<00:01:12.570> got<00:01:12.659> more<00:01:12.990> control<00:01:13.170> over<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.619> actual

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
it's got more control over the actual

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.249 
it's got more control over the actual
slamming<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:15.270> version<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.810> much<00:01:16.049> better

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
slamming so this version is much better

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.630 
slamming so this version is much better
you<00:01:16.979> know<00:01:18.799> even<00:01:19.799> though<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:19.890> break<00:01:20.189> early<00:01:20.520> of

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
you know even though you break early of

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.330 
you know even though you break early of
course<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:21.600> car<00:01:21.780> doesn't<00:01:21.960> one<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.170> ton<00:01:22.409> that's

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
course the car doesn't one a ton that's

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.830 
course the car doesn't one a ton that's
great<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:23.909> can<00:01:24.030> get<00:01:24.150> some<00:01:24.299> nice<00:01:24.390> control

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
great and you can get some nice control

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.969 
great and you can get some nice control
obviously<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.320> lot<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.439> throttle<00:01:25.619> control

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
obviously a lot of throttle control

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.980 
obviously a lot of throttle control
involved<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.520> if<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.119> do<00:01:27.210> like<00:01:27.330> overall<00:01:27.840> the

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
involved and if you do like overall the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.660 
involved and if you do like overall the
nose<00:01:28.170> actually<00:01:28.560> respond<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.280> turning

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
nose actually respond and the turning

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.999 
nose actually respond and the turning
circle<00:01:30.079> becomes<00:01:31.079> greater<00:01:31.409> than<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.680> actual

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
circle becomes greater than the actual

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.499 
circle becomes greater than the actual
normal<00:01:32.070> version<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.490> slamming<00:01:32.850> also<00:01:33.450> you

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
normal version of slamming also you

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.109 
normal version of slamming also you
notice<00:01:33.689> here<00:01:33.869> acceleration<00:01:34.439> shoots<00:01:35.100> off<00:01:35.340> but

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
notice here acceleration shoots off but

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.910

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
both of them are quite hard to turn but

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.039 
both of them are quite hard to turn but
obviously<00:02:17.430> but<00:02:17.999> the<00:02:18.060> normal<00:02:18.450> Slam<00:02:18.629> men's<00:02:18.780> even

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
obviously but the normal Slam men's even

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.259 
obviously but the normal Slam men's even
harder<00:02:19.349> over<00:02:20.099> the<00:02:20.219> normal<00:02:20.549> sorry<00:02:20.939> the<00:02:21.090> lost

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
harder over the normal sorry the lost

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.690 
harder over the normal sorry the lost
version<00:02:21.689> so<00:02:21.959> normal<00:02:22.620> slam<00:02:22.829> man<00:02:22.980> had<00:02:23.189> zero

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
version so normal slam man had zero

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.819 
version so normal slam man had zero
customisation<00:02:24.480> options<00:02:24.540> but<00:02:25.139> the<00:02:25.379> lost<00:02:25.620> land

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829 
customisation options but the lost land

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:27.949 
customisation options but the lost land
man<00:02:25.950> has<00:02:26.189> three<00:02:26.849> options<00:02:27.239> for<00:02:27.299> the<00:02:27.450> custom

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
man has three options for the custom

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.179 
man has three options for the custom
liveries<00:02:28.260> you<00:02:28.349> can<00:02:28.500> choose<00:02:28.680> from<00:02:28.859> other<00:02:29.069> than

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:29.189 
liveries you can choose from other than

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:30.319 
liveries you can choose from other than
that<00:02:29.370> it's<00:02:29.549> pretty<00:02:29.670> much<00:02:29.819> the<00:02:30.000> same<00:02:30.120> as<00:02:30.269> the

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
that it's pretty much the same as the

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:31.910 
that it's pretty much the same as the
slamming<00:02:30.629> so<00:02:30.870> it's<00:02:31.349> gonna<00:02:31.439> give<00:02:31.590> a<00:02:31.680> point

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
slamming so it's gonna give a point

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.530 
slamming so it's gonna give a point
there<00:02:32.099> for<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.579> lost<00:02:32.760> version<00:02:33.150> anyway<00:02:33.329> just

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
there for the lost version anyway just

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.899 
there for the lost version anyway just
because<00:02:33.840> of<00:02:33.989> that<00:02:34.019> little<00:02:34.829> bit<00:02:34.920> of<00:02:35.010> variety<00:02:35.430> I

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
because of that little bit of variety I

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.300 
because of that little bit of variety I
guess<00:02:36.090> right<00:02:36.659> so<00:02:36.930> lap<00:02:37.560> time<00:02:37.769> test<00:02:38.010> of<00:02:38.129> course

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
guess right so lap time test of course

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.589 
guess right so lap time test of course
so<00:02:38.519> this<00:02:38.639> is<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:38.790> little<00:02:39.000> bit<00:02:39.090> self-explanatory

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
so this is a little bit self-explanatory

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.179 
so this is a little bit self-explanatory
I'm<00:02:39.900> not<00:02:39.989> gonna<00:02:40.109> say<00:02:40.230> much<00:02:40.290> about<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:40.889> I'm<00:02:41.040> sure

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:41.189 
I'm not gonna say much about it I'm sure

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:42.259 
I'm not gonna say much about it I'm sure

yeah<00:03:07.530> first<00:03:07.889> of<00:03:08.040> all<00:03:08.159> regarding<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:09.090> damage

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:09.449 
yeah first of all regarding the damage

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:12.140 
yeah first of all regarding the damage
test<00:03:09.719> where<00:03:09.930> is<00:03:10.049> it<00:03:10.199> quite<00:03:11.010> a<00:03:11.040> few<00:03:11.099> things<00:03:11.849> have

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
test where is it quite a few things have

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.879 
test where is it quite a few things have
actually<00:03:12.870> changed<00:03:13.049> with<00:03:13.379> that<00:03:13.590> in<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.769> game

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:13.889 
actually changed with that in the game

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:16.009 
actually changed with that in the game
after<00:03:14.189> the<00:03:14.400> heist<00:03:14.549> dlc<00:03:14.729> update<00:03:15.090> somebody's

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
after the heist dlc update somebody's

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.379 
after the heist dlc update somebody's
the<00:03:16.139> values<00:03:16.500> keep<00:03:16.769> changing<00:03:17.340> every<00:03:17.790> time<00:03:18.150> I

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
the values keep changing every time I

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.300 
the values keep changing every time I
repeat<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.079> tests<00:03:19.319> on<00:03:19.439> the<00:03:19.500> same<00:03:19.680> vehicle<00:03:19.919> so

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
repeat the tests on the same vehicle so

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.369 
repeat the tests on the same vehicle so
usually<00:03:21.150> if<00:03:21.329> it's<00:03:21.509> something<00:03:21.870> like<00:03:21.900> you<00:03:22.109> know

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
usually if it's something like you know

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:24.949 
usually if it's something like you know
a<00:03:22.409> city<00:03:22.709> career<00:03:22.979> most<00:03:23.150> $25<00:03:24.150> to<00:03:24.359> repair<00:03:24.750> right

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
a city career most $25 to repair right

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.409 
a city career most $25 to repair right
it<00:03:25.439> would<00:03:25.620> constantly<00:03:26.069> consistently<00:03:26.639> be<00:03:26.729> 295

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:27.419 
it would constantly consistently be 295

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:28.939 
it would constantly consistently be 295
every<00:03:27.689> time<00:03:27.870> repeat<00:03:28.199> the<00:03:28.319> same<00:03:28.530> tests<00:03:28.889> that

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:28.949 
every time repeat the same tests that

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:30.140 
every time repeat the same tests that
covering<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.400> same<00:03:29.489> distance<00:03:29.849> with<00:03:30.090> the

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
covering the same distance with the

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.909 
covering the same distance with the
weenie<00:03:30.299> SC<00:03:30.599> but<00:03:31.019> now<00:03:31.199> the<00:03:31.349> value<00:03:31.709> keeps

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:31.919 
weenie SC but now the value keeps

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:33.920 
weenie SC but now the value keeps
changing<00:03:32.250> for<00:03:32.639> the<00:03:32.759> vehicles<00:03:33.120> so<00:03:33.329> I<00:03:33.540> don't

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
changing for the vehicles so I don't

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:34.789 
changing for the vehicles so I don't
know<00:03:33.989> what<00:03:34.109> they've<00:03:34.229> done<00:03:34.349> over<00:03:34.379> that<00:03:34.620> I<00:03:34.650> don't

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
know what they've done over that I don't

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.039 
know what they've done over that I don't
know<00:03:34.859> if<00:03:34.919> it's<00:03:35.009> intended<00:03:35.340> maybe<00:03:35.669> you<00:03:36.419> know<00:03:36.540> I

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
know if it's intended maybe you know I

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.559 
know if it's intended maybe you know I
don't<00:03:37.590> know<00:03:37.650> they<00:03:37.799> might<00:03:37.829> broken<00:03:38.340> vows<00:03:39.239> what

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
don't know they might broken vows what

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.240 
don't know they might broken vows what
about<00:03:39.810> you<00:03:40.169> know<00:03:40.290> honestly<00:03:40.620> I<00:03:40.709> can't<00:03:41.040> really

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
about you know honestly I can't really

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.399 
about you know honestly I can't really
tell<00:03:41.609> right<00:03:41.849> now<00:03:41.879> but<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.599> damage<00:03:42.959> longer<00:03:43.290> why

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:43.409 
tell right now but the damage longer why

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:45.259 
tell right now but the damage longer why
but<00:03:43.620> it's<00:03:43.919> kind<00:03:44.159> of<00:03:44.220> broken<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.879> way<00:03:44.970> I<00:03:45.000> see

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
but it's kind of broken the way I see

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.449 
but it's kind of broken the way I see
you<00:03:45.389> so<00:03:45.780> I<00:03:46.019> might<00:03:46.979> bring<00:03:47.159> back<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.430> old

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
you so I might bring back the old

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.089 
you so I might bring back the old
durability<00:03:48.180> test<00:03:48.449> where<00:03:48.720> I<00:03:49.079> repeat<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:49.859> test

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
durability test where I repeat the test

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:51.499 
durability test where I repeat the test
instead<00:03:50.489> of<00:03:50.609> actually<00:03:50.879> checking<00:03:51.060> a<00:03:51.209> repair

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:51.509 
instead of actually checking a repair

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:53.179 
instead of actually checking a repair
cost<00:03:51.750> but<00:03:51.989> visually<00:03:52.169> tell<00:03:52.590> from<00:03:52.859> the<00:03:53.009> car

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:53.189 
cost but visually tell from the car

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:55.879 
cost but visually tell from the car
itself<00:03:53.719> which<00:03:54.719> one's<00:03:54.959> more<00:03:55.139> durable<00:03:55.560> for<00:03:55.620> just

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
itself which one's more durable for just

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:57.020 
itself which one's more durable for just
from<00:03:56.009> the<00:03:56.099> damage<00:03:56.370> because<00:03:56.579> that's<00:03:56.759> pretty

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
from the damage because that's pretty

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.390 
from the damage because that's pretty
much<00:03:57.120> what<00:03:57.239> matters<00:03:57.750> I<00:03:57.840> guess<00:03:58.049> you<00:03:58.949> know<00:03:59.069> which

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
much what matters I guess you know which

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.849 
much what matters I guess you know which
one<00:03:59.699> you<00:04:00.090> know<00:04:00.239> it's<00:04:00.959> the<00:04:01.079> first<00:04:01.290> to<00:04:01.560> get<00:04:01.739> the

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
one you know it's the first to get the

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.969 
one you know it's the first to get the
tires<00:04:02.099> rigged<00:04:02.549> from<00:04:03.509> the<00:04:03.870> bump<00:04:04.079> is<00:04:04.290> sort<00:04:04.949> of

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:04.979 
tires rigged from the bump is sort of

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:06.409 
tires rigged from the bump is sort of
the<00:04:05.069> collision<00:04:05.579> and<00:04:05.669> emotion<00:04:06.060> all<00:04:06.209> of<00:04:06.329> this

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:06.419 
the collision and emotion all of this

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:08.209 
the collision and emotion all of this
I'm<00:04:06.959> not<00:04:07.199> sure<00:04:07.349> if<00:04:07.530> I<00:04:07.590> want<00:04:07.769> to<00:04:07.829> go<00:04:07.889> into<00:04:08.099> that

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:08.219 
I'm not sure if I want to go into that

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:09.890 
I'm not sure if I want to go into that
much<00:04:08.370> detail<00:04:08.430> honestly<00:04:09.269> because<00:04:09.389> you<00:04:09.569> know<00:04:09.810> it

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
much detail honestly because you know it

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.170 
much detail honestly because you know it
is<00:04:09.930> GTA<00:04:10.259> 5<00:04:10.530> but<00:04:10.799> this<00:04:11.340> in<00:04:11.489> itself<00:04:11.789> is<00:04:12.030> going

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
is GTA 5 but this in itself is going

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.929 
is GTA 5 but this in itself is going
into<00:04:12.389> too<00:04:12.479> much<00:04:12.599> detail<00:04:12.959> anyway<00:04:13.289> but<00:04:13.669> I'm<00:04:14.669> sure

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:14.939 
into too much detail anyway but I'm sure

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:16.370 
into too much detail anyway but I'm sure
this<00:04:15.060> is<00:04:15.180> all<00:04:15.299> to<00:04:15.569> satisfy<00:04:16.049> people's

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
this is all to satisfy people's

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.990 
this is all to satisfy people's
curiosity<00:04:16.560> that's<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.609> reason<00:04:17.849> why<00:04:17.940> the

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
curiosity that's the reason why the

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.089 
curiosity that's the reason why the
series<00:04:18.359> exists<00:04:18.840> but<00:04:19.380> yeah<00:04:19.469> as<00:04:19.680> you<00:04:19.799> can<00:04:19.919> see

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099 
series exists but yeah as you can see

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:21.860 
series exists but yeah as you can see
right<00:04:20.310> now<00:04:20.340> the<00:04:20.579> lost<00:04:21.090> land<00:04:21.269> man<00:04:21.419> pretty<00:04:21.719> much

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
right now the lost land man pretty much

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.000 
right now the lost land man pretty much
annihilates<00:04:22.289> normal<00:04:22.680> boys

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
annihilates normal boys

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.010 
annihilates normal boys
and<00:04:23.130> that<00:04:23.280> is<00:04:23.370> sort<00:04:23.640> of<00:04:23.670> expected<00:04:24.210> but<00:04:24.810> now<00:04:24.960> you

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
and that is sort of expected but now you

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.360 
and that is sort of expected but now you
sort<00:04:25.290> of<00:04:25.350> see<00:04:25.500> a<00:04:25.530> perspective<00:04:26.010> between<00:04:26.160> the

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
sort of see a perspective between the

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.770 
sort of see a perspective between the
two<00:04:26.520> how<00:04:26.760> much<00:04:26.940> of<00:04:27.060> a<00:04:27.120> difference<00:04:27.450> there<00:04:27.630> is

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
two how much of a difference there is

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.690 
two how much of a difference there is
actually<00:04:28.170> and<00:04:28.350> it's<00:04:28.800> quite<00:04:29.070> a<00:04:29.100> bit<00:04:29.430> you<00:04:29.670> can

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
actually and it's quite a bit you can

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.040 
actually and it's quite a bit you can
just<00:04:30.060> sort<00:04:30.180> of<00:04:30.240> tell<00:04:30.510> right<00:04:30.690> now

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
just sort of tell right now

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.620 
just sort of tell right now
there<00:04:31.710> is<00:04:31.920> an<00:04:32.130> insane<00:04:32.730> gap<00:04:33.090> near<00:04:33.300> enough<00:04:33.510> from

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
there is an insane gap near enough from

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.600 
there is an insane gap near enough from
nine<00:04:33.840> seconds<00:04:34.440> between<00:04:34.770> the<00:04:35.070> two<00:04:35.250> put<00:04:35.460> it<00:04:35.520> that

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
nine seconds between the two put it that
