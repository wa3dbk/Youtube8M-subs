00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:17.150
 very good welcome to another video of 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:19.400
 history of japan with racing almost from 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.619
 because sometimes I put psychopathic boat today 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.690
 how do I usually do when 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.400
 Sometimes I talk about something very old then 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.930
 exchanged with something a little more modern 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.970
 and like the last video I made of 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.189
 history was the oldest of all that 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.840
 we went there the two extinct 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.940
 today I want to talk about a character 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.670
 pretty modern today I want to talk to you 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.180
 little one of the most directors 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.000
 famous of japan 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.680
 there are a few which can be I do not know 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.250
 why am I going to play if they put it on 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.050
 title weight and top top takeshi kitano hay 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.650
 others quite famous also as 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:56.379
 takashi miike or akira kurosawa but today 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.850
 I'm going to talk about Takenano Taiji because 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.290
 I'm going to talk about Takenano Taiji because 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.690
 the story of Takhi takeshi the truth 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.100
 is that it has had ups and downs and a whole 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.410
 little good for those who do not know 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.100
 Takenano Takhi is originally from Tokyo 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:11.950
 was born in the capital and is 68 years old 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.110
 he was born in 47 his career in 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.990
 television did not start as a director or 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:20.770
 as an actor he started being a humorist 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:23.560
 He made humor very different from others 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.780
 Japanese of the time and especially for 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.750
 the Spaniards became very famous thanks 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.660
 to the most famous takeshi's castle 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.979
 in Spain as a humor to Mauricio sure 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.320
 that many do not know but if not 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.000
 you knew that famous yellow humor that 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.430
 many of us thought it was from Chinese not 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.860
 It was Japanese and it was a Tahini Takehi 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.080
 the director and the one who created today the one who 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.230
 this Japanese idea occurred to him by giving himself 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.570
 of milk 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.340
 and has never seen in the time and the truth 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.690
 is that it attracted a lot of attention and good to 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.250
 tookhi kitano was made a little more 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.170
 famous although he was also criticized 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.930
 quite because it was a humor too 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.700
 crappy for the time his career 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.330
 we can truly say that it started with the 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.370
 violent movie that he was going to be the 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.230
 main actor and that's it but 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.030
 coincidences of life or destiny 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.560
 the director of that movie did not 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.570
 agreement if he had an accident he got wrong 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.270
 or what happened that in the end although it does remove 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:17.120
 I do not end up being the director at the same time 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.950
 that the actor of the film and the truth 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.170
 is that it was a success and seville or that 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.050
 tookhi kitano had the future then 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.270
 he started making many movies and 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.040
 sure many already know several of 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.780
 the most famous movies of takeshi 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.570
 Kitano, I'm thinking a little 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.000
 hanabi or the summer of cocuy and I do not think 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.620
 that has been downloaded to touch and also 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.720
 we have seen for example not as 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.040
 directors but the mat came out the royal 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.780
 one of the most famous 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.880
 international good enough or for 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.580
 example he also directed sonatine that was 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.400
 a movie like so many he did about 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.660
 yakuzas normally he is done on 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.870
 all jazz cinema 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.420
 chungos is very since you use problems of 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.490
 yakuza the hosts like loaves something 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.320
 yakuza and I am a super fan of the 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.800
 cat type games that will vote them since 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.510
 You will know that they specified vo to those of 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.910
 Molan bitches have to be recognized by 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.860
 many that are moore and recovering a 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.320
 Little story of Takenano Taiji 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.020
 after shooting the sonatine movie 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.290
 He had a pretty motorcycle accident 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.760
 crappy that left him paralyzed more or 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.530
 minus half of the face that's why 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.630
 I really do not know if you have noticed but 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.280
 whenever he leaves he has half 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.620
 of the face like to really give alone 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.500
 can move one half of the face 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.710
 curious and the most curious of all is that 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.950
 he confirmed that it had been an attempt to 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:39.050
 suicide was already thrown uncle this one 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.580
 It was peeling when it started to 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.680
 go perfect the race you try 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.000
 committing suicide is left with half of 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.640
 the face without moving and start doing 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.220
 many more more actor movies and 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.740
 of all kinds after in the head of 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.120
 takeshi kitano nobody knows but now 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.040
 same today takeshi kitano 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.840
 I still think that doing some movie 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.580
 the truth is that I'm not sure what 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.190
 I do see a lot on TV 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.230
 as the plan tertuliano leave heaps 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.580
 TV programs always plan 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.260
 opinion also sometimes a little 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.930
 I'm messing around too, so the guy with 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.120
 his almost 70 years is still laughing at himself 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.459
 himself continues to do serious things and the 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.770
 sometimes bullshit things you see posters 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.109
 advertising by the tele osa is a 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.680
 face that looks looks pretty around here 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:19.910
 for Japan 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.620
 Now I'm going to tell you some 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.060
 how many curiosities for example in 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.520
 all the movies that takeshi kitano 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.190
 he leaves as an actor in the credits never 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.470
 Tahiti takeshi if it does not appear 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.480
 beat takeshi happens to be the name 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.430
 I had when I had a comedy duo in 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.140
 the antiquity and it remained as a name 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.230
 artistic also tried to do 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.870
 videogames made four video games 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:44.419
 called takeshi shinjo or something like that 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.460
 They are considered the worst videogames 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.770
 of the history of mankind 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.480
 so the poor thing is that if you do not 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.880
 gave this very good to direct videogames 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.350
 and left the idea less bad 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.180
 and to finish one of the most 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.529
 interesting is that in his time of 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.519
 television between 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:03.259
 twice to your co2 hopefully you remember him or 

00:05:01.519 --> 00:05:05.749
 your name sounds if it should because I was 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:07.999
 talking about him makes a couple of videos the 

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:09.739
 leader of the sect super chunga true 

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:11.359
 supreme that they did the whole attack 

00:05:09.739 --> 00:05:13.459
 this can you takehi kitano was the 

00:05:11.359 --> 00:05:16.009
 few who interviewed him and also more 

00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:18.829
 at once which took him many, many 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:20.989
 criticism although he has never said 

00:05:18.829 --> 00:05:22.699
 publicly whether he was a supporter or not 

00:05:20.989 --> 00:05:24.229
 of this religion but good with the 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:25.729
 piraos that is a little sense this does not 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:28.009
 I would be surprised if he had also believed 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:30.709
 a little in religion is who knows 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:32.959
 but hey it's another curiosity it's more 

00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:34.399
 I like to be able to link my videos with 

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:36.919
 others or that now that has been spoken 

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:38.989
 of yoko atajada I recommend you also not 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:40.249
 I know if they do not put an appointment to prick and 

00:05:38.989 --> 00:05:41.929
 you must 

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:43.969
 and nothing else I think that has already been told 

00:05:41.929 --> 00:05:46.129
 Everything I know about Takenano Taiji 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:47.569
 so I hope you liked it 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:49.699
 you see some of his movies if you do not 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:54.609
 you have done and we see you in another 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:54.609
 History of Japan with almost practice 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.550
 one
