00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
energy but there's also some stability

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.349 
energy but there's also some stability

speaking<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.030> sensuality<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:43.050> if<00:00:43.290> we<00:00:43.500> can<00:00:43.710> use

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
speaking and sensuality is if we can use

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.970 
speaking and sensuality is if we can use
our<00:00:44.129> physical<00:00:44.879> senses<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:46.079> help<00:00:46.350> us<00:00:46.530> become

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
our physical senses to help us become

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.729 
our physical senses to help us become
more<00:00:47.010> aware<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:48.000> what's<00:00:48.420> worthwhile<00:00:48.780> well

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
more aware of what's worthwhile well

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.389 
more aware of what's worthwhile well
yeah<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.160> we<00:00:50.250> oddly<00:00:50.460> enough<00:00:51.120> after<00:00:51.989> some

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
yeah and we oddly enough after some

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.760 
yeah and we oddly enough after some
distractions<00:00:53.399> we're<00:00:54.030> also<00:00:54.239> getting<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:55.590> is

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
distractions we're also getting this is

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.920 
distractions we're also getting this is
odd<00:00:55.980> but<00:00:56.250> some<00:00:56.489> stability<00:00:56.760> from<00:00:57.360> Gemini<00:00:57.899> I

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
odd but some stability from Gemini I

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.290 
odd but some stability from Gemini I
think<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.680> Sun<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.129> geminis<00:00:59.579> coming<00:01:00.059> into<00:01:00.270> a

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
think the Sun and geminis coming into a

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.150 
think the Sun and geminis coming into a
trine<00:01:00.629> with<00:01:00.840> Mars<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:01.320> not<00:01:01.469> exact<00:01:01.800> for<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.039> day

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
trine with Mars it's not exact for a day

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.450 
trine with Mars it's not exact for a day
or<00:01:02.309> two<00:01:02.340> but<00:01:02.969> where<00:01:03.180> but<00:01:03.570> but<00:01:03.870> in<00:01:04.140> our<00:01:04.589> kind<00:01:05.250> of

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
or two but where but but in our kind of

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.730 
or two but where but but in our kind of
distracted<00:01:06.270> motions<00:01:07.020> we're<00:01:07.560> actually

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
distracted motions we're actually

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.410 
distracted motions we're actually
getting<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.549> think<00:01:08.580> we're<00:01:08.880> getting<00:01:09.000> things

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
getting I think we're getting things

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.410 
getting I think we're getting things
done<00:01:09.750> now<00:01:10.140> well<00:01:10.799> also<00:01:11.010> i<00:01:11.250> think<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.610> mind<00:01:12.150> is

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
done now well also i think the mind is

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.660 
done now well also i think the mind is
not<00:01:12.630> coming<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.290> point<00:01:13.619> but<00:01:13.830> it's<00:01:14.100> coming<00:01:14.369> to

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
not coming to a point but it's coming to

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.749 
not coming to a point but it's coming to
occur<00:01:15.500> mercury<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.770> planet<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.340> mind<00:01:17.549> or

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
occur mercury the planet of the mind or

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.609 
occur mercury the planet of the mind or

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
but it has a direction it's almost as if

but it has a direction it's almost as if
there's<00:01:33.990> been<00:01:34.170> this<00:01:34.790> intellectual

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
there's been this intellectual

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.109 
there's been this intellectual
collecting<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.900> ideas<00:01:37.680> that's<00:01:38.220> beginning<00:01:39.090> to

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
collecting of ideas that's beginning to

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.090 
collecting of ideas that's beginning to
find<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.900> current<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.560> it's<00:01:40.770> going<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:40.979> be

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
find a current that it's going to be

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.649 
find a current that it's going to be
following<00:01:41.610> for<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.880> next<00:01:42.150> couple<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.479> weeks

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
following for the next couple of weeks

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.230 
following for the next couple of weeks
yeah<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.079> i<00:01:43.140> think<00:01:43.170> also<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:44.250> fact<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.670> that

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
yeah and i think also the fact that that

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.200 
yeah and i think also the fact that that
the<00:01:45.540> Sun<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:45.810> in<00:01:46.140> gemini<00:01:46.619> mercury<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.520> geminis

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
mercury is ahead of the Sun now it's in

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.440 
mercury is ahead of the Sun now it's in
a<00:01:55.350> different<00:01:55.530> sign<00:01:56.040> it's<00:01:56.579> almost<00:01:56.969> like<00:01:57.240> our

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.639 
next round of change that we may be
facing<00:02:05.250> over<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.299> next<00:02:06.540> month<00:02:06.840> months<00:02:07.380> ahead

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
facing over the next month months ahead

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.339 
facing over the next month months ahead
is<00:02:08.429> really<00:02:08.910> about<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.479> inner<00:02:09.629> planets<00:02:10.110> moving

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
is really about the inner planets moving

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.130 
is really about the inner planets moving
into<00:02:10.770> watery<00:02:11.190> cancer<00:02:12.060> which<00:02:12.510> is<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.720> little<00:02:12.930> bit

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
into watery cancer which is a little bit

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.370 
into watery cancer which is a little bit
of<00:02:13.230> a

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
of a

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.500 
of a
different<00:02:13.710> flavor<00:02:14.010> than<00:02:14.190> then<00:02:15.150> where<00:02:15.330> we're

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
different flavor than then where we're

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.210 
different flavor than then where we're
coming<00:02:15.660> from<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.290> so<00:02:16.620> I<00:02:16.650> think<00:02:16.770> that<00:02:16.950> the

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
coming from and so I think that the

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.460 
coming from and so I think that the
image<00:02:17.580> of<00:02:17.790> this<00:02:17.940> curve<00:02:18.300> that<00:02:18.570> you<00:02:18.690> said<00:02:18.930> it's<00:02:19.320> a

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
image of this curve that you said it's a

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.090 
image of this curve that you said it's a
gentle<00:02:19.920> curve<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.550> and<00:02:21.450> it's<00:02:21.810> not<00:02:22.080> like<00:02:22.350> high

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
gentle curve and and it's not like high

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.760 
gentle curve and and it's not like high
tension<00:02:23.910> it's<00:02:24.360> more<00:02:24.810> of<00:02:24.930> just<00:02:24.960> like<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.350> feeling

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
tension it's more of just like a feeling

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.820 
tension it's more of just like a feeling
that<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.310> tide<00:02:26.610> is<00:02:27.000> changing<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.960> we<00:02:28.470> need<00:02:28.650> to

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
that the tide is changing and we need to

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.150 
that the tide is changing and we need to
change<00:02:29.070> with<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:29.610> I'm<00:02:30.480> Rick<00:02:30.780> Lavigne<00:02:31.110> I'm<00:02:31.770> Jeff

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
change with it I'm Rick Lavigne I'm Jeff

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.340 
change with it I'm Rick Lavigne I'm Jeff
