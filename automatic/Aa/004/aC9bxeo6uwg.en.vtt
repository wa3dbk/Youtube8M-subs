00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
far as the carburetor goes before i

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.670 
far as the carburetor goes before i
rebuilt<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.210> always<00:01:15.360> ran<00:01:15.720> good<00:01:15.990> i<00:01:16.290> mean

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
rebuilt it it always ran good i mean

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.789 
rebuilt it it always ran good i mean
after<00:01:16.950> i<00:01:17.220> rebuilt<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:17.970> always<00:01:18.119> ran<00:01:18.450> good

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
after i rebuilt it it always ran good

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.240 
after i rebuilt it it always ran good
but<00:01:19.799> there<00:01:19.950> was<00:01:20.070> only<00:01:20.159> one<00:01:20.520> problem<00:01:22.250> the

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
but there was only one problem the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.100 
but there was only one problem the
problem<00:01:23.430> was<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.939> high-speed<00:01:24.360> mixture<00:01:24.810> screw

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
problem was the high-speed mixture screw

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.890 
problem was the high-speed mixture screw
I<00:01:25.380> mean<00:01:25.770> when<00:01:26.340> he<00:01:26.430> would<00:01:26.549> screw<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.970> out<00:01:27.119> screw

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
I mean when he would screw it out screw

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.719 
I mean when he would screw it out screw
it<00:01:27.990> in<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.140> out<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:29.040> engine<00:01:29.430> would<00:01:29.549> do

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
it in and out the engine would do

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.429 
it in and out the engine would do
nothing<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.270> mean<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.570> was<00:01:30.659> like<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.810> cold<00:01:31.079> fish

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
nothing I mean it was like a cold fish

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.429 
nothing I mean it was like a cold fish
it<00:01:31.770> wouldn't<00:01:32.430> slow<00:01:32.700> down<00:01:32.939> when<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.420> chug<00:01:33.689> when

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
it wouldn't slow down when it chug when

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.039 
it wouldn't slow down when it chug when
installed<00:01:35.000> the<00:01:36.000> engine<00:01:36.060> wouldn't<00:01:36.450> do<00:01:36.630> nothing

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
installed the engine wouldn't do nothing

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.280 
installed the engine wouldn't do nothing
I<00:01:37.520> even<00:01:38.520> tried<00:01:38.759> different<00:01:39.090> mixture<00:01:39.960> screws

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
I even tried different mixture screws

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.770 
I even tried different mixture screws
and<00:01:41.329> that<00:01:42.329> didn't<00:01:42.630> help<00:01:42.750> at<00:01:42.930> all<00:01:44.689> but<00:01:45.689> i'm

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
and that didn't help at all but i'm

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
worked properly but uh when the angel

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.010 
worked properly but uh when the angel
would<00:03:18.640> be<00:03:18.850> running<00:03:19.300> when<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:19.630> engine<00:03:19.900> would

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
would be running when the engine would

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.250 
would be running when the engine would
get<00:03:20.260> hot<00:03:20.470> you<00:03:20.709> you<00:03:21.010> could<00:03:21.160> notice<00:03:21.520> that<00:03:21.700> the

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
get hot you you could notice that the

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260 
get hot you you could notice that the
you<00:03:23.260> notice<00:03:23.590> that<00:03:23.800> the<00:03:23.950> muffler<00:03:24.400> would<00:03:25.060> turn

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
you notice that the muffler would turn

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.479 
you notice that the muffler would turn
bright<00:03:25.630> orange<00:03:26.140> and<00:03:26.410> i<00:03:26.950> think<00:03:27.190> it's<00:03:27.340> because

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
bright orange and i think it's because

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.699 
bright orange and i think it's because
the<00:03:27.850> mixture<00:03:28.239> is<00:03:28.360> off<00:03:28.570> i<00:03:28.750> think<00:03:28.810> the<00:03:29.080> engine<00:03:29.560> is

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
the mixture is off i think the engine is

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.420 
the mixture is off i think the engine is
running<00:03:29.950> too<00:03:30.280> rich<00:03:30.959> I<00:03:32.160> think<00:03:33.160> that's<00:03:33.340> the

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
running too rich I think that's the

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.310 
running too rich I think that's the
reason<00:03:33.760> why<00:03:33.790> the<00:03:34.000> muffler<00:03:34.480> is<00:03:34.660> turning<00:03:35.050> bright

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
reason why the muffler is turning bright

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.680 
reason why the muffler is turning bright
orange<00:03:35.770> and<00:03:36.400> yeah<00:03:37.180> i'm<00:03:37.330> going<00:03:37.480> to<00:03:37.540> give<00:03:37.660> this

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
orange and yeah i'm going to give this

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.650 
orange and yeah i'm going to give this
carburetor<00:03:38.170> one<00:03:38.530> last<00:03:38.800> try<00:03:39.100> i<00:03:39.489> mean<00:03:40.150> if<00:03:40.600> the

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
carburetor one last try i mean if the

carburetor one last try i mean if the
paperclip<00:03:41.380> trick<00:03:42.100> does<00:03:42.310> not<00:03:42.489> do<00:03:42.670> the<00:03:42.820> trick

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090
