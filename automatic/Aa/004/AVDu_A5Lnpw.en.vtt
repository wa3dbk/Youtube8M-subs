00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
magnetic field the magnetic field also

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.630 
magnetic field the magnetic field also
improves<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.829> blood<00:01:55.979> flow<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.610> area

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
improves the blood flow to the area

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.300 
improves the blood flow to the area
increasing<00:01:57.479> oxygen<00:01:57.630> nutrients<00:01:58.500> this<00:01:58.950> all

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
increasing oxygen nutrients this all

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.480 
increasing oxygen nutrients this all
this<00:01:59.399> heat<00:01:59.700> helps<00:02:00.240> melt<00:02:00.719> fat<00:02:01.189> tighten<00:02:02.189> skin

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
this heat helps melt fat tighten skin

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.539 
this heat helps melt fat tighten skin
improve<00:02:03.149> cellulite<00:02:03.590> reduce<00:02:04.590> wrinkles<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.430> how

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
improve cellulite reduce wrinkles so how

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.100 
improve cellulite reduce wrinkles so how
does<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.729> work

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
does it work

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.290 
does it work
so<00:02:07.110> this<00:02:07.259> head<00:02:07.520> emits<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.640> magnetic<00:02:08.729> field

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
so this head emits a magnetic field

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.020 
so this head emits a magnetic field
mm-hmm<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.050> magnetic<00:02:10.500> field

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
mm-hmm the magnetic field

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.880 
mm-hmm the magnetic field
hate<00:02:11.450> ya<00:02:11.930> which<00:02:12.170> stimulates<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.770> formation

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
hate ya which stimulates the formation

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.670 
hate ya which stimulates the formation
of<00:02:13.430> new<00:02:13.610> collagen<00:02:14.030> yep<00:02:14.480> and<00:02:14.780> this<00:02:15.140> results<00:02:15.590> in

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
of new collagen yep and this results in

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.760 
of new collagen yep and this results in
tighter<00:02:16.040> skin<00:02:16.450> reduces<00:02:17.450> lines<00:02:17.660> and<00:02:18.080> reduces

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
tighter skin reduces lines and reduces

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.250 
tighter skin reduces lines and reduces
the<00:02:19.100> cellulite<00:02:19.550> as<00:02:19.700> well<00:02:19.880> right<00:02:20.390> so<00:02:20.690> you're

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
the cellulite as well right so you're

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.840 
the cellulite as well right so you're
basically<00:02:21.530> saying<00:02:21.680> it's<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.160> heat<00:02:22.459> that's

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
basically saying it's the heat that's

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.520 
basically saying it's the heat that's
gonna<00:02:23.150> cause<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.600> wrinkles<00:02:23.930> to<00:02:24.050> disappear

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
gonna cause the wrinkles to disappear

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.410 
gonna cause the wrinkles to disappear
through<00:02:25.520> the<00:02:25.700> formation<00:02:25.970> of<00:02:26.209> new<00:02:26.390> collagen

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
through the formation of new collagen

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.590 
through the formation of new collagen
yes<00:02:27.230> so<00:02:27.800> it<00:02:28.069> doesn't<00:02:28.370> burn<00:02:28.489> no<00:02:29.150> it<00:02:29.270> doesn't

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
yes so it doesn't burn no it doesn't

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.690 
yes so it doesn't burn no it doesn't
burn<00:02:29.750> it's<00:02:30.020> very<00:02:30.319> safe<00:02:30.590> device<00:02:30.980> so<00:02:31.430> I'm<00:02:31.489> just

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
burn it's very safe device so I'm just

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.979 
burn it's very safe device so I'm just
measuring<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:32.060> temperature<00:02:32.540> here<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:32.870> we've

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
measuring the temperature here and we've

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.370 
measuring the temperature here and we've
got<00:02:33.170> about<00:02:33.260> 42<00:02:33.920> degrees<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:34.630> now<00:02:35.630> and<00:02:35.989> that<00:02:36.170> I

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
got about 42 degrees and now and that I

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.750 
got about 42 degrees and now and that I
reach<00:02:36.680> that<00:02:36.709> temperature<00:02:37.010> very<00:02:37.400> quickly<00:02:37.610> in

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
reach that temperature very quickly in

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.100
