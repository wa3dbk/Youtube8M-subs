00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.090
 hello to all today we find ourselves 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.970
 for the presentation of a small box 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.390
 great practice at ati boxing is the 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.939
 ibm p400 1st so for the reference and 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.500
 what is the case for this case so it goes all 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.899
 simply you have come back to share 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.670
 your music via airplay on 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.829
 devices like hi-fi 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.870
 not having bluetooh so for example 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.190
 you have a geisha do not fit so wants 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.379
 not an old one a hi-fi all 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.460
 There are many who do not have the 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.899
 taste everything and it's quite disturbing 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.700
 because when you want to put some 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.010
 music with your iphone or your 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.160
 smartphone not necessarily iphone you 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.469
 are obliged to connect it via a cable 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.899
 jack in general and this little box 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.270
 you're going to plug me in jack 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.059
 3.5 to your hi-fi system you have 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.189
 connect your device to this 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.200
 wifi flight case of your device 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.900
 and you will have more than to spread a big 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.119
 with airplay it works with android 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.130
 also a ca ios and android media in 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.500
 Any case for iphone and ipad and ipod 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.640
 it works great with airplay and if 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.500
 you have an android no problem 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.970
 it's compatible too and you will not have 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.920
 more than to stream your music on 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.220
 your hi-fi system and it works great 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.780
 well 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.189
 the only little weak point that I 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.049
 give it is that takes everything you 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.119
 connect for example your phone into 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.060
 drops or at a for example a 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.530
 wireless speaker on 6 and instant 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.970
 that is, you mount the sound 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.500
 climbs directly on the speaker 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.939
 there you still have a tiny 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.460
 late shift in any case with the iphone 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.320
 of a few seconds but finally some 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.659
 seconds maybe one or two seconds 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.460
 but it still feels like nothing 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.290
 well disturbing in any case I hope that 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.640
