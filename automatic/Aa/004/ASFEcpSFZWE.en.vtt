around the hook it's tight up against
the<00:02:14.319> previous<00:02:14.590> wrap<00:02:15.489> that<00:02:15.730> went<00:02:15.910> around<00:02:16.090> the

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
the previous wrap that went around the

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.369 
the previous wrap that went around the
shank<00:02:16.599> of<00:02:16.720> that<00:02:16.870> hook

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
shank of that hook

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.190 
shank of that hook
once<00:02:18.190> you<00:02:18.280> have<00:02:18.400> all<00:02:18.519> 10<00:02:18.760> of<00:02:18.879> those<00:02:18.970> done<00:02:19.299> next

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
once you have all 10 of those done next

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.780 
once you have all 10 of those done next
step<00:02:20.440> is<00:02:20.590> pretty<00:02:20.739> simple<00:02:21.069> you're<00:02:21.610> going<00:02:21.730> to

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
step is pretty simple you're going to

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.490 
step is pretty simple you're going to
grab<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.269> line<00:02:22.480> right<00:02:22.870> at<00:02:22.959> the<00:02:23.080> very<00:02:23.290> bottom

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
grab the line right at the very bottom

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.229 
grab the line right at the very bottom
wall<00:02:23.860> all<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.069> wraps<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.730> make<00:02:24.879> sure<00:02:25.090> it

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
wall all the wraps to make sure it

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.600 
wall all the wraps to make sure it
doesn't<00:02:25.420> come<00:02:25.750> on<00:02:25.780> wound<00:02:26.200> once<00:02:27.129> you<00:02:27.250> have<00:02:27.400> that

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
doesn't come on wound once you have that

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.210 
doesn't come on wound once you have that
line<00:02:28.120> firmly<00:02:28.510> in<00:02:28.720> your<00:02:28.840> hand<00:02:29.079> you're<00:02:30.040> going<00:02:30.160> to

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
line firmly in your hand you're going to

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.580 
line firmly in your hand you're going to
grab<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.519> end<00:02:30.549> of<00:02:30.879> the<00:02:30.940> line<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:32.470> you're

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
grab the end of the line and you're

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.140 
grab the end of the line and you're
going<00:02:32.709> to<00:02:32.739> push<00:02:32.950> it<00:02:33.099> again<00:02:33.370> back<00:02:33.730> through<00:02:34.060> the

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
going to push it again back through the

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.500 
going to push it again back through the
eye<00:02:34.180> of<00:02:34.299> the<00:02:34.540> hook<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:35.910> little<00:02:36.910> tricky<00:02:37.209> once<00:02:37.390> in

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
eye of the hook a little tricky once in

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.819 
eye of the hook a little tricky once in
a<00:02:37.569> while<00:02:37.690> getting<00:02:37.930> through<00:02:38.230> that<00:02:38.319> eye<00:02:38.379> but

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
a while getting through that eye but

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:39.630 
a while getting through that eye but
you'll<00:02:38.950> figure<00:02:39.160> it<00:02:39.280> out

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
you'll figure it out

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.449 
you'll figure it out
once<00:02:40.060> you<00:02:40.150> do<00:02:40.299> that<00:02:40.950> you're<00:02:41.950> going<00:02:42.040> to<00:02:42.099> slowly

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
once you do that you're going to slowly

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:43.830 
once you do that you're going to slowly
pull<00:02:42.879> the<00:02:43.000> line<00:02:43.209> through<00:02:43.450> you<00:02:43.540> don't<00:02:43.660> want<00:02:43.780> a

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
pull the line through you don't want a

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.750 
pull the line through you don't want a
bunch<00:02:43.989> of<00:02:44.079> twists<00:02:44.470> in<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.680> line<00:02:44.890> you<00:02:45.489> want<00:02:45.610> to

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
bunch of twists in the line you want to

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.190 
bunch of twists in the line you want to
come<00:02:45.910> through<00:02:46.090> that<00:02:46.150> iodine<00:02:46.480> look<00:02:46.780> nice<00:02:46.989> and

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
come through that iodine look nice and

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.990 
come through that iodine look nice and
smoothly<00:02:47.590> and<00:02:47.980> then<00:02:48.400> once<00:02:48.640> you're<00:02:48.790> all<00:02:48.970> the

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
smoothly and then once you're all the

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.670 
smoothly and then once you're all the
way<00:02:49.180> through<00:02:49.540> near<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:49.840> end<00:02:50.019> you'll<00:02:50.410> slow

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
way through near the end you'll slow

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.170 
way through near the end you'll slow
down<00:02:50.890> and<00:02:51.099> you'll<00:02:51.190> just<00:02:51.310> pull<00:02:51.579> that<00:02:51.609> nice<00:02:51.940> and

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
down and you'll just pull that nice and

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.270 
down and you'll just pull that nice and
snug<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:52.840> then<00:02:53.440> what<00:02:53.680> will<00:02:53.769> happen<00:02:54.099> is

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
snug and then what will happen is

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.759 
snug and then what will happen is
actually<00:02:54.579> as<00:02:55.000> you<00:02:55.090> pull<00:02:55.390> that<00:02:55.569> line<00:02:55.810> more<00:02:56.620> and

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
actually as you pull that line more and

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.800 
actually as you pull that line more and
more<00:02:56.950> that's<00:02:57.190> that<00:02:57.730> snail<00:02:58.209> look<00:02:58.569> actually

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
more that's that snail look actually

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.120 
more that's that snail look actually
gets<00:02:59.139> tighter<00:02:59.410> and<00:02:59.500> tighter<00:02:59.680> there's<00:02:59.980> no

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
gets tighter and tighter there's no

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.920 
gets tighter and tighter there's no
danger<00:03:00.549> that<00:03:00.730> Snell<00:03:01.030> ever<00:03:01.269> coming<00:03:01.599> out<00:03:01.690> the

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
danger that Snell ever coming out the

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.259 
danger that Snell ever coming out the
last<00:03:02.139> step<00:03:02.410> of<00:03:02.560> this<00:03:02.680> process<00:03:03.400> is<00:03:03.819> you'll<00:03:03.970> grab

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
last step of this process is you'll grab

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.420 
last step of this process is you'll grab
your<00:03:04.510> Clippers<00:03:04.989> you'll<00:03:05.530> clip<00:03:05.799> off<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.010> line

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
your Clippers you'll clip off the line

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.509 
your Clippers you'll clip off the line
just<00:03:07.299> a<00:03:07.450> little<00:03:07.660> bit<00:03:07.810> behind<00:03:08.079> the<00:03:08.500> end<00:03:09.220> of<00:03:09.400> that

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
just a little bit behind the end of that

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.699 
just a little bit behind the end of that
wrap<00:03:09.760> that<00:03:10.000> you<00:03:10.030> just<00:03:10.239> put<00:03:10.450> on<00:03:10.569> the<00:03:10.690> hook<00:03:10.870> once

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
wrap that you just put on the hook once

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.500 
wrap that you just put on the hook once
you<00:03:11.829> have<00:03:11.919> your<00:03:12.010> black<00:03:12.310> octopus<00:03:12.970> hook<00:03:13.239> on<00:03:13.419> the

octopus hook on the line that's going to

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.159 
octopus hook on the line that's going to
become<00:03:17.380> your<00:03:17.680> front<00:03:18.040> look<00:03:18.930> then<00:03:19.930> you're<00:03:20.079> going

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:20.169 
become your front look then you're going

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:21.479 
become your front look then you're going
to<00:03:20.260> need<00:03:20.349> to<00:03:20.440> determine<00:03:20.560> how<00:03:20.919> big<00:03:21.069> of<00:03:21.160> a<00:03:21.280> gap

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489

to need to determine how big of a gap
you<00:03:21.700> want<00:03:21.849> between<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:22.329> back<00:03:22.540> hook<00:03:22.840> and<00:03:23.049> the

you want between the back hook and the
front<00:03:23.769> red<00:03:24.130> hook<00:03:24.430> somewhere<00:03:24.970> around<00:03:25.120> 3<00:03:25.510> to<00:03:25.599> 4

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
front red hook somewhere around 3 to 4

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.449 
front red hook somewhere around 3 to 4
inches<00:03:26.079> is<00:03:26.230> probably<00:03:26.590> about<00:03:26.709> right<00:03:27.010> we<00:03:27.280> made<00:03:27.430> a

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
inches is probably about right we made a

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.580 
inches is probably about right we made a
template<00:03:28.000> so<00:03:28.329> we<00:03:28.450> can<00:03:28.599> make<00:03:28.750> ours<00:03:28.959> exactly<00:03:29.470> the

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
template so we can make ours exactly the
