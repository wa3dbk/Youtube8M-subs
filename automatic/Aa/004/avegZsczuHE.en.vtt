about 30,000 threat to about 50,000
threat<00:03:23.840> pre-loaded<00:03:24.610> maybe<00:03:25.610> maybe<00:03:25.910> a<00:03:26.030> little

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
threat pre-loaded maybe maybe a little

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.060 
threat pre-loaded maybe maybe a little
bit<00:03:26.360> less<00:03:26.540> but<00:03:26.570> that's<00:03:27.470> just<00:03:27.560> depending<00:03:27.980> on

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
bit less but that's just depending on

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.720 
bit less but that's just depending on
here<00:03:28.280> so<00:03:29.800> encrypts<00:03:30.800> and<00:03:30.950> stuff<00:03:31.100> like<00:03:31.250> that<00:03:31.310> so

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
here so encrypts and stuff like that so

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.070 
here so encrypts and stuff like that so
I<00:03:31.760> mean<00:03:32.000> this<00:03:32.060> is<00:03:32.240> really<00:03:32.390> good<00:03:32.690> because<00:03:32.780> we

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
I mean this is really good because we

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.360 
I mean this is really good because we
need<00:03:33.260> to<00:03:33.410> initiate<00:03:33.590> as<00:03:33.890> much<00:03:34.070> stuff<00:03:34.340> as

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
need to initiate as much stuff as

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.270 
need to initiate as much stuff as
possible<00:03:34.489> while<00:03:35.060> we're<00:03:35.209> running<00:03:35.450> in<00:03:36.280> before

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
possible while we're running in before

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.770
