00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.009
 Balakovo history began with 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:19.039
 the seventies when in the Volga region 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:20.999
 started searching for a territory for 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:24.059
 future powerful and there and the station is capable 

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:27.039
 solve the problem identified throughout the region 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:28.849
 power shortage 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:30.489
 construction of Balakovo NPP 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:32.989
 marked the beginning of a new phase in 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.250
 development of the country's nuclear power industry 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.250
 construction m with 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.280
 commissioning of the first power unit 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.450
 Balakovo station held twenty 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.980
 December 8th, 1908 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.140
 from this year 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.170
 Now it is one of the best ee Russia and 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.940
 largest manufacturer 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.090
 electricity in the country 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.920
 first year of operation Balakovo NPP 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.140
 produced a little over five billion 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.260
 kilowatt hours of electricity 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.909
 akimova made up more than five 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.620
 among projects 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.670
 as new blocks were introduced 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.620
 improved professional 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.690

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.420
 highest revenue 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.780
 stations reached thousands of 900 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.400
 in the ninth year 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.040
 blocks were produced 19 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.000
 billion kilowatt hours of electricity 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.410

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.410
 installed capacity 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.130
 with you a valid 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.660
 forward if this process 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.940
 in the future for nuclear energy 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.890
 as for the whole industry 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.560
 hard times have come 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.890

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.040
 state device 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.860
 despite this, in 1995, it was possible 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.660
 to complete and even the fourth power unit 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.580
 stations 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.290
 since 2002 the station has been producing 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.040
 over twenty eight billion kilowatts 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.220
 electricity hours per year 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.600
 at the same time the impact of Balakovo NPP on 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.669
 environment g 

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:10.919
 radiation background in the city of Balakovo 

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.669
 on the site of the plant after so many years 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:15.099
 operation 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.680
 corresponds to the level of natural background 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.049
 values 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:20.930
 this is the result of a big 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:21.729
 work 

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:23.069

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.639
 supervision of the radiation department 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:26.879
 station security 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.809
 carries out constant control 

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:30.469
 behind the influence of technological 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:32.729
 process on the environment 

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:34.649
 and controlled exposure to harmful 

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:36.729
 substances resulting from 

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:38.659
 electricity generation at 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:41.469
 nuclear power plant of key projects 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:42.879
 in addition, a system has been developed 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.619
 polder protections provide 

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:48.489
 station emission parameters required 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.079
 the result is actually an emission 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.379
 through ventilation 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.730
 is tenths and hundredths of a percent 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.079

00:02:57.999 --> 00:03:00.019
 and support systems
