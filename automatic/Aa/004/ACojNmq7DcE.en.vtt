00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I’m going to be a volunteer today. 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:39.000
I’m very excited about that. I get to be up close with the animals and it’s a great opportunity. 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.000
I’m doing this because I love animals 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.000
and also it’s a great opportunity to actually be behind the scenes.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
One of the most important things again that we need to do every day is have a good look at our animals 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.000
and a good way of doing that is to come up and give them a little something to eat. 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.000
And that then gives us the opportunity 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.000
to just get in close and have a good look and make sure they’re all healthy.
It’s got very nice fur.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.000
Oh, they’re lovely and soft.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
So we’re just going to feed out Priya. If you want to grab some of these branches.
Yep, sure.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So we’re just going to feed out Priya. If you want to grab some of these branches.
Yep, sure.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:21.000
So we bring them in new food every single day. 
Is there any reason why the entire branch is being brought in or?

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.000
They’re really fussy so they like to pick and choose which of the leaves they want to eat. 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.000
So they’re much better at telling apart which ones are good for them and which ones aren’t, 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.000
so we tend to leave the choices to them.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
They’re much better at telling apart which ones are good for them and which ones aren’t, 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.000
so we tend to leave the choices to them. And they are quite picky.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.000
So there’s about 800 different kinds of eucalyptus.  They only eat about 60 of those.  

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.000
And of all the leaves on this they only really like those nice fresh tips at the top there.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
This tree kangaroo is the Goodfellow’s tree kangaroo. 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.000
They’re a kangaroo that has evolved to live up in the trees.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
They’re a kangaroo that has evolved to live up in the trees instead of on the ground.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Basically they have been hunted in their native habitat for their beautiful coat.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Today’s trip to the zoo was absolutely wonderful. 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:43.000
I’ve had so much interaction with the animals and I didn’t expect to work so close with the animals. 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:50.000
I got to pet them, I got to feed them and it was just absolutely amazing. 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:56.000
Coming to Taronga Zoo has just been such a wonderful experience and I’ll never forget it.
