00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:14.809
 because he felt 15- 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:16.349
 better yet again 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:21.019
 a triptych I hope someone is doing well to roll the mother of both 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.650
 elders 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.130
 I hope my ideals inspire you 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.130
 you are our project 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.330
 I will not introduce you to the days of the viie why in video a new 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.679
 page of my article l 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.059
 when I start by already having a good idea of ​​what I'm going to do everything 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:35.320
 in 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.790
 not knowing too badly 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.050
 at least what will give the results 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.390
 as usual I start with a mail jets will then 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.230
 I use Mastrou foot of the city 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.990
 to fill from the bottom of the page 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.720
 and then we erected shortly above 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.780
 then I decide to do it themselves 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.780
 geometric shapes in the forehead 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.790
 so without really knowing what will be judged what will it give what 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:02.840
 whether it is 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.160
 and then I start 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.320
 the little by little percent but but sarko 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.970
 it shows I sign that 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.970
 Limoux 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.310
 40 euros 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.240
 nothing is left 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.240
 this is how 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.840
 in the secondary but stone the same theme why seven 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.840
 this page e3 my money but it's working e 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.570
 the depth in the era she says whatever 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.860
 every time I go I trace my text no 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.500
 and every time he's Jewish and an Arab so I did 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.140
 it does not slice I add that the complaint some parades and especially of 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.409
 next game 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:12.679
 Yes and no 

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:15.100
 so the genesis of the second party 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.489
 of clerck 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.489
 but that it really allows me to work the depth 

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:23.489
 to really have a legion 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:24.959
 perspectives 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.299
 but you will tell me yes but why relapse subsist to a slight 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:29.389
 smile 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:31.559
 because it's as if I had 

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:35.679
 it seems to me a layer that I jump but slight sow tends to flatten 

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:38.769
 while with the callus that really has an effect of afp 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.769
 the limits of 3d 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:46.469
 but that's what I like a lot in the double in the work with 

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:49.469
 lucas 

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:59.119
 very young 

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:09.970
 the day 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.899
 3rd classic TV series 

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:14.899
 over all the country not right now 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:17.599
 novelty the last drawing 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.599
 5 

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:29.309
 and I continued so on until cannes 

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:32.309
 the fisc and that I am satisfied with my game 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:39.389
 - when i 

00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:01.529
 late wednesday 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:09.889
 lively marine life 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:44.770
 3 division 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.770
 It's a record 

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:12.249
 hansson to doubt 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.240
 5 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.150
 so once I'm satisfied with my chosen driving of 30 meters a 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.779
 Photo 

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:27.180
 she a walk in the forest 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.699
 that I had taken 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:30.879
 g 

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:34.639
 surrounded the photo and minck note that the oblique more than I used 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:36.490
 instead for m 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:37.809
 for us background 

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:43.419
 and I still framed petty telethon guests another 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:44.680
 with herringbone 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.389
 menouar and white 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:48.580
 eh yes 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.660
 finally I found that there were not enough branches on them 

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:54.779
 on the left 

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:56.830
 so I'm doing it again 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.830
 some colleagues 

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:11.189
 to finish at 2 

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:12.699
 this page 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:15.319
 the goal is my title on an island 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:16.779
 seiler 

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:19.849
 transportation between shortly hip 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:22.610
 a gesture falls in the poet 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.779
 and I write further m and what s 

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:29.129
 I will say 

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:32.129
 besides a breath 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:35.699
 belgacom europe 

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:44.309
 but I also write the rest wonders if he is being closely watched 

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:48.119
 it is new and transparent 

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:51.009
 creche 

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:54.009
 who said yesterday 

00:06:56.039 --> 00:06:59.570
