00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.840
 Hello dear viewers with you 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.519
 nefilim and cotton community and today in 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.580
 the next issue of winning strategy we 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.680
 look at a very, very unusual fight 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.960
 the battle is so unusual in turn 1 your card 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.410
 I think everyone knew you very well. 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.160
 see this we have province battle for 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.009
 edema disembarking 1 16 final departure against 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.989
 steel 7 on this map you can play 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.750
 only in two ways either riding on 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.690
 the so-called sand technology 1 2 3 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.210
 level or one global picture is 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.140
 in the world war map and on it can 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.629
 land and land so 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.670
 would we go to a quarter of its real 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.920
 speeds we see how slow the theater is 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.239
 sulfur let's take a look at our setup 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.309
 rivals and at the same time look at 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:01.980
 dislocation chooses 2 st stage very 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.489
 fast with the support of two heavy 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.560
 tanks e100 and 7 fallen that can 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.260
 home 268 is very good at 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.500
 throughout the battle constantly in trogir 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.950
 This thing gives out great damage to dpm 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.350
 in a short period of time 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.790
 fv215b 183 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.970
 great alpha guaranteed on cell 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.880
 even with a non-penetration of 780 points which is very and 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.590
 very good for that 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.420
 important in this map is this 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.320
 tsiferka which is now showing the mouse 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.900
 600 meters is our distance from 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.900
 square 1 to square 1 map 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.340
 very very small everyone knows it 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.229
 respectively, there is nowhere to hide and 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.810
 the fight must be very, very 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.409
 fast so continuing to look at 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.350
 minimap I turn on the first speed and we 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.350
 we see that the hood remained on its 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.729
 cutting two e100 and pvc 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.149
 historians descended when 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:03.390
 which can be nice to tank and st 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.630
 by all means go through the whole 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.700
 map and climb to the head to the side 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.340
 spawn 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.920
 Steel Clan 7 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.019
 gender setups rivals that we can 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.530
 see heavy tanks 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:20.120
 several batchatov artillery 1 open 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.400
 a little secret will be 2 though absolutely 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.530
 it is not clear why she is very map here 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.180
 little everything is very luminous and 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.980
 Accordingly, the tide is applied very and 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.160
 very difficult because it lit up 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.319
 at the very beginning at the junction 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.280
 here we will see 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.440
 convenient position for firing at 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.790
 anti-tank self-propelled guns 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.319
 belt 7 you we must hang down and 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.549
 accordingly receive from the guard in the soup 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.930
 from e100 and from the tanks here 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:50.569
 here but they are not good can add by 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.930
 light and see what more trillions 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.970
 very well asked for your add 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.450
 because of their speed they got already 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.430
 before 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.470
 sharply rivals sent that song 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.709
 chain wanga and now sent 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.790
 eat 60 deuce and artillery conquer 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:09.349
 avant-garde gareth 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:11.420
 British here at the same time from and 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:13.280
 the seventh below is actually dismantled 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.579
 allowed a small exchange of this 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.220
 absolutely not fundamentally, the score is already 71 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:22.639
 Two minutes of battle have passed and in principle already 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:26.420
 the outcome is clear let's try to figure it out. 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:29.090
 Why did it happen here ? 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.920
 everything is so I think only because of the choice not 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.510
 quite right you are on clans steel 7 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:38.060
 let's see what's in the arsenal of junction 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.919
 7 homemade cakes that can 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.739
 lit very, very good unit 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:44.540
 time damage and very fast 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.870
 batchat and that can kind of cut 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.579
 7 of this and the object is 268 watch 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.230
 a few sheets of becoming which you can 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.959
 say so neither fish nor meat no 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.790
 strong light is of course good 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.919
 armor well as we know cumulative 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.680
 and some skill allow this armor 

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:01.970
 ignore especially since 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.950
 support shot here weights and 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.540
 respectively, the angle for breaking through 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.410
 their own top was very very 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:12.290
 good bask in the tower in the hatches as sal 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.840
 in butter or rather like a knife in butter enters 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.030
 them shells even lugs here 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.700
 wrong setup for this card 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.650
 which led to such a fast 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.509
 defeat and now we already 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.720
 let's look at normal speed 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:29.520
 switch we see how finishes 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:34.169
 waffentur auf e100 discharges its 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:37.470
 drum fits through smoke and now 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:39.240
 will achieve 155 mince three minutes of battle 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.250
 passed another 14 2 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.550
 and all due to the fact that you are not quite right 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.410
 percent on minimap see how 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.880
 shrill greedy up to damage tanks who 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.430
 more on shoots enhanced treat 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.199
 damage to the waffenturger word 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.860
 whose we are watching the feet playo shot 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:58.320
 five thousand which is very, very good for 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:02.580
 This self-propelled gun implemented several 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:04.440
 the drums with you were nephilim and 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.970
 community boorish vault thanks for that 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.970
 see us all bye
