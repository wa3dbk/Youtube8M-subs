00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.360
 oh guys starting a video its short 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.970
 here to talk about habituei 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.500
 It seems the Bitrem left here in the 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.769
 mwl 4 channel your channel name 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.269
 face and does not have many subscribers he has 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:29.070
 659 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.330
 but I was analyzing here is the same 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.020
 face that posted 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.820
 some time ago it is pictures of the 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.329
 multiplayer changing 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:44.430
 certain that he was talking about the 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:47.910
 lights a little 2 in the window and such 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.969
 now there is a controversial video here too 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.860
 showing the double articulation here 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.250
 number 32 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.890
 and it looks like it's in testing there 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.399
 and as I said earlier videos 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.530
 this was not impossible is not a thing 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.020
 impossible to do because this is a 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.140
 feature that was locked inside the 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.970
 game of escs other than two is not one 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.130
 feature that was open for you to 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.950
 to move and was inside the flying 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.659
 I could not even unzip the game 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.030
 because as everyone knows how to 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.780
 to compile the game's home folder so that 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.820
 you can do the then trams and then 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.470
 I had a file that I could not 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.560
 unpack and it looks like they 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.079
 will achieve and is not a joint that 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.780
 You're going to say, man, it's beautiful because 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.009
 as you all know the itu are three axes is 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.310
 three axes 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:47.520
 instead of one but however it is already a 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.020
 great advance you see articulation in the 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.329
 two attack then you are 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.380
 waiting a lot of bi train can be 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.149
 Arriving there is one day I do not know, it's already here. 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.860
 arriving in the near future let's go 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.759
 Say well. 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:06.000
 I think you see this here I do not know if 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.979
 may be one thing in multiplayer is one 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.039
 What is there to stay there? 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.650
 question is no more than a little 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.110
 strange is still more 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.030
 can improve over time so 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.760
 keep an eye on the guy channel here 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.530
 what is a bmw r 4 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.420
 I'll leave the link in the description of the 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.170
 video for you to go there and see check everything 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.610
 right and see if this can or can not be 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.170
 some real 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.700
 remembering that is a lot of bi train 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.409
 even here it might be a 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.329
 may not be can be a 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:37.970
 exclusive multiplayer thing as well 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:40.829
 I can not rule out any hypothesis 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:44.459
 but it is not that Roman truck 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:46.680
 Julieta, the truck is already loaded 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.200
 and then you connect the trailer, not this 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.230
 here is a trailer that connects the other 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.680
 trailer even then we can expect this 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.040
 there 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:59.040
 Sometime soon, then a hug. 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.900
 for you to comment what you think 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.840
 leave a comment there too, I do not see 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.849
 expensive a Brazilian comment there for 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.220
 to see that we have our eyes on everything and it is 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:12.680
 That's a good hug for you guys 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.680
 we came back in the next video and Czech the 1
