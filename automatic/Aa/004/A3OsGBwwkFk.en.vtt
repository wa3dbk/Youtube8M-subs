00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.840
 two men 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.580
 a budget 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.670
 quickest from zero to hundred in going 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:17.980
 almost zero 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.980
 from a typical glands if there is this 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.570
 car week trip is beautiful 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.480
 edo and roland shop every week for one 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:32.890
 different budget 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.890
 this week's budget is 5,000 euros 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.910
 you smarter white think that longer 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:28.170
 I can go yes exactly because volvo 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:29.750
 240 gle sd do the wonderful low at the 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.500
 masks porridge 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:36.630
 290 1,000 km on uncertain and I like it 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.910
 This Volvo 240 is becoming more and more popular 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.740
 exist alongside a solid Mercedes 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.210
 the hare and absolutely out 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.030
 if that requires at least as good maintenance 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.620
 just not exactly pikey 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.680
 overviews and safety practical 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.120
 invisible to 4 tons of maria 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.580
 He also looks slightly lesser 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.320
 she jumps from her is in me 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.210
 but i have to say you really want your best 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.250
 what a beautiful copy and done 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.960
 4450 euros 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.610
 you see so much with young artists 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.240
 with little money that is still reliable 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.220
 way 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.560
 well that is that point they are actually already 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.420
 a little beyond the 240 that are 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.040
 they indeed have been a while but 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.900
 slowly but surely sees the prices too 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.490
 cars are increasingly rising 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.380
 be cherished by the 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.120
 enthusiasts and collectors 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.489
 we definitely look at cars if this is that 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.020
 just for 5000 euros for sale then I have 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:29.160
 also made 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.080
 look exactly the same i say 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.910
 cars only 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.010
 svensson is no doubt better run in 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.330
 so want me here in the 100 km 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.600
 yes but he is not entirely honest 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.060
 because you it about 14,000 kilometers 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.790
 reason he child a farmer and by one of 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.390
 my first time being the 42 year whose 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.860
 problem is that only through space 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.600
 wise choice is of course not to 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.530
 the hand because they are both even 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.300
 wise 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.670
 yes i would like a natural one there 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.050
 I fully agree, but I have to 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.720
 admit that you have done your best 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.310
 because with this type of car is how 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.270
 lower the mileage the better 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.860
 principle 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.570
 and you just have to look carefully at the 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.700
 maintenance history if that car is good 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.740
 is maintained then you can almost call 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.590
 fall and this has indeed more 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.970
 experience this has fewer kilometers 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.100
 but it has more and almost a ton 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.710
 fewer kilometers I think you have this 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:24.569
 are well deserved but I'm here too 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:26.819
 under it also agree and sweet 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:30.359
 you might not be as pretty as the 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:32.219
 other but we think it is crazy yes you 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:35.909
 are just forming as a family member 

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:37.240
 so we have to offer this 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:39.770
 do it for me 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.610
 do it for rauwerd 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.610
 target street weeks 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.710
 but 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.020
 from 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.550
 awnings 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.990
 haha 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.819
 Mr. car week 9 position is saved 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.600
 nuon yes yes and so I did my best 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.990
 at could not veins queen Elsa sorry 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.520
 no you can also do that where me 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.710
 am indeed quite happy that I have the 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.720
 gentleman of old know exactly but it 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:48.740
 is an idea that I had the first 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:50.150
 you have become the second amai i 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.630

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.630
 also with your fingers 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.210
 I would just listen seriously in both 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:58.370
 cars are not yet found dead 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.470
 its really the most sanrio baker out there 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.210
 but yes but good if I then 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.770
 yet we have to choose to look 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.990
 for which the car is the least 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.490
 striking about stickers is common and none 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.100

 feels a bit more is victory 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.130
 but still 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:25.070
