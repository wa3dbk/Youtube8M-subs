and I had PMS premenstrual syndrome
where<00:02:48.540> I<00:02:48.570> would<00:02:49.020> even<00:02:49.290> start<00:02:49.770> to<00:02:49.920> cramp<00:02:50.220> before

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
where I would even start to cramp before

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.450 
where I would even start to cramp before
I<00:02:50.820> had<00:02:51.240> my<00:02:51.270> period<00:02:51.840> I<00:02:52.380> knew<00:02:52.950> that<00:02:52.980> it<00:02:53.280> was

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
I had my period I knew that it was

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.660 
I had my period I knew that it was
coming<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:54.240> it<00:02:55.200> was<00:02:55.440> infrequent<00:02:55.920> but<00:02:56.340> when<00:02:56.550> it

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
coming and it was infrequent but when it

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.810 
coming and it was infrequent but when it
came<00:02:56.910> it<00:02:57.240> was<00:02:57.450> it<00:02:57.840> was<00:02:58.020> not<00:02:58.050> fun<00:02:58.500> and<00:02:59.750> so<00:03:01.550> when<00:03:02.550> I

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
came it was it was not fun and so when I

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.640 
came it was it was not fun and so when I
later<00:03:03.380> became<00:03:04.380> vegan<00:03:04.860> I<00:03:05.540> already<00:03:06.540> noticed<00:03:07.470> a

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
later became vegan I already noticed a

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.390 
later became vegan I already noticed a
difference<00:03:08.040> in<00:03:08.780> that<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:10.380> amount<00:03:11.220> of<00:03:11.340> blood

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
difference in that the amount of blood

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
difference in that the amount of blood
that<00:03:11.700> I<00:03:11.940> had<00:03:12.300> was<00:03:12.510> much<00:03:12.780> less<00:03:13.170> I<00:03:14.060> didn't<00:03:15.060> feel

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
that I had was much less I didn't feel

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.920 
that I had was much less I didn't feel
as<00:03:15.870> sick<00:03:16.500> I<00:03:16.890> wasn't<00:03:17.820> a<00:03:17.850> hundred<00:03:18.000> percent<00:03:18.209> yet

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
as sick I wasn't a hundred percent yet

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.770 
as sick I wasn't a hundred percent yet
for<00:03:19.290> sure<00:03:19.610> because<00:03:20.610> I<00:03:20.850> did<00:03:21.150> eat<00:03:21.420> processed

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.060
