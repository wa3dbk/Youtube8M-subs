here's one go in the same direction very
obvious<00:00:36.440> here's<00:00:37.440> one<00:00:37.879> very<00:00:38.879> very<00:00:39.239> obvious<00:00:39.809> one

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
obvious here's one very very obvious one

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.090 
obvious here's one very very obvious one
of<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.170> better<00:00:40.379> ones<00:00:42.230> going<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.410> same<00:00:43.680> way<00:00:43.710> as

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
of the better ones going the same way as

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:56.060 
of the better ones going the same way as
we're<00:00:44.309> going<00:00:44.730> here<00:00:53.180> there<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:55.070> possibly

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
we're going here there and possibly

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.340 
we're going here there and possibly
there<00:00:56.309> but<00:00:56.520> he<00:00:56.699> definitely<00:00:56.910> I'd<00:00:57.329> say<00:00:57.600> here<00:00:58.020> and

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
there but he definitely I'd say here and

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.060 
there but he definitely I'd say here and
then<00:00:59.010> here's<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.399> trot<00:00:59.760> Oh<00:00:59.840> again<00:01:00.840> he's<00:01:01.770> still

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
then here's the trot Oh again he's still

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.130 
then here's the trot Oh again he's still
moving<00:01:02.280> along<00:01:02.550> here<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.300> there's<00:01:03.539> his<00:01:03.719> next

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
moving along here and there's his next

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.270 
moving along here and there's his next
one<00:01:04.400> right<00:01:05.400> there<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.619> we<00:01:07.619> think<00:01:07.799> this<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.250> a

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
one right there and we think this is a

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.649 
one right there and we think this is a
big<00:01:08.670> one<00:01:08.909> here<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.659> middle<00:01:11.150> the<00:01:12.150> big<00:01:12.180> round

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
big one here in the middle the big round

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:23.990 
big one here in the middle the big round
one<00:01:18.320> we<00:01:19.320> follow<00:01:19.619> them<00:01:19.890> on<00:01:20.070> up<00:01:20.340> here<00:01:22.729> and<00:01:23.729> here

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
one we follow them on up here and here

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.319 
one we follow them on up here and here
he<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.119> again<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:29.990> another<00:01:30.990> one<00:01:31.229> right<00:01:31.439> there

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
he is again and another one right there

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:34.789 
he is again and another one right there
it's<00:01:33.329> in<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.659> mud<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.900> little<00:01:34.259> bit<00:01:34.380> we've<00:01:34.619> been

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
it's in the mud a little bit we've been

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.810 
it's in the mud a little bit we've been
walking<00:01:35.220> in<00:01:35.310> here<00:01:36.110> and<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.549> just<00:01:38.549> keeps

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
walking in here and so it just keeps

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:48.590 
walking in here and so it just keeps
going<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:40.070> here's<00:01:41.070> another<00:01:41.220> one

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.950 

and<00:01:49.600> that's<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:50.320> end<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:52.390> then<00:01:52.540> we<00:01:52.630> reached

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
and that's the end and then we reached

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.840 
and that's the end and then we reached
where<00:01:53.230> they<00:01:53.380> put<00:01:53.620> concrete<00:01:53.890> across<00:01:54.460> in<00:01:54.760> the

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
where they put concrete across in the

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.560 
where they put concrete across in the
riverbed<00:01:55.330> here<00:01:58.350> not<00:01:59.350> cool
