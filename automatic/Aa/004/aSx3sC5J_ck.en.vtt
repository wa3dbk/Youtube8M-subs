zoom out a little bit you have two
levels<00:01:04.040> of<00:01:04.189> memory<00:01:05.089> cleaning<00:01:05.920> level<00:01:06.920> one

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320

memory<00:01:19.130> so<00:01:20.500> let's<00:01:21.500> just<00:01:21.710> go<00:01:21.920> and<00:01:22.250> do<00:01:22.780> the<00:01:23.780> level

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
memory so let's just go and do the level

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.430 
memory so let's just go and do the level
one<00:01:24.530> cleaning<00:01:24.830> here<00:01:25.810> says<00:01:26.810> it<00:01:26.930> can<00:01:27.080> take<00:01:27.260> some

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
one cleaning here says it can take some

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.940 
one cleaning here says it can take some
time<00:01:27.710> so<00:01:28.210> let's<00:01:29.210> start<00:01:32.140> it<00:01:33.140> says<00:01:33.380> it<00:01:33.530> takes<00:01:33.680> 10

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
time so let's start it says it takes 10

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.510 
time so let's start it says it takes 10
to<00:01:33.979> 30<00:01:34.310> seconds<00:01:34.880> to<00:01:35.800> do<00:01:36.800> some<00:01:37.340> of<00:01:37.430> this

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
to 30 seconds to do some of this

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.630 
to 30 seconds to do some of this
cleaning<00:01:41.170> i'll<00:01:42.170> just<00:01:42.530> wait<00:01:42.710> and<00:01:43.040> before<00:01:43.610> we

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
cleaning i'll just wait and before we

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.730 
cleaning i'll just wait and before we
hit<00:01:43.790> that<00:01:43.850> with<00:01:44.240> 12.4<00:01:44.930> megabyte<00:01:45.350> and<00:01:45.560> free

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
hit that with 12.4 megabyte and free

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.510 
hit that with 12.4 megabyte and free
memory<00:01:47.500> i'm<00:01:48.500> sure<00:01:48.710> you<00:01:48.890> could<00:01:49.010> turn<00:01:49.190> off<00:01:49.370> your

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
memory i'm sure you could turn off your

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.330 
memory i'm sure you could turn off your
phone<00:01:49.729> and<00:01:49.760> turn<00:01:50.030> it<00:01:50.150> back<00:01:50.180> on<00:01:50.860> to<00:01:51.860> free<00:01:52.220> up

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
phone and turn it back on to free up

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.140 
phone and turn it back on to free up
memory<00:01:53.920> and<00:01:54.920> you'd<00:01:55.520> save<00:01:55.820> a<00:01:55.850> dollar

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
memory and you'd save a dollar

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.750 
memory and you'd save a dollar
ninety-nine<00:01:57.040> alright<00:01:58.040> so<00:01:58.310> let's<00:01:58.490> go<00:01:58.580> back

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
ninety-nine alright so let's go back

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.780 
ninety-nine alright so let's go back
here<00:01:59.560> now<00:02:00.560> you<00:02:01.520> zoom<00:02:01.820> in<00:02:02.000> at<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.450> difference

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
here now you zoom in at the difference

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.619 
here now you zoom in at the difference
we<00:02:04.790> now<00:02:05.030> have<00:02:06.430> 43<00:02:07.430> megabytes<00:02:08.030> of<00:02:08.149> free<00:02:08.390> memory

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 
we now have 43 megabytes of free memory
