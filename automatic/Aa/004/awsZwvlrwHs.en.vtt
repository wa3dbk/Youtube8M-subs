00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 you trader dot ru yellow and you go 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.400
 round-the-clock delivery in five minutes 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.980
 link to the description of all the good time 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.710
 days ladies and gentlemen risks with you then 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.609
 now we are on the version 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.670
 games archeage 1.2 and I will tell you my 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.730
 impressions after the test 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.910
 of this version that I am actually speaking to you 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.599
 I can say I liked it or not 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:34.649
 This version of client 1.2 to be honest 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:38.430
 I liked of course this change 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.640
 have their disadvantages they concern for example 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.200
 some mechanics skills ie 7 and 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.739
 naturally still can be 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.800
 redone as mail.ru will be with this 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.230
 work is no longer ours as they say 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.530
 Care I wanted to show you in mechanics 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.210
 gutting 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.670
 look how slow but now 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.690
 work back to what was on 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.820
 zbt 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.360
 most likely now is ping 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.080
 all skin type dependencies 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:12.960
 gutting the blades of death gambling and 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:17.250
 so what else do I want to tell you about 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.530
 pvp itself is actually dad version 1.2 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.340
 very diversified and 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.659
 the number of points we give you 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.950
 era of wars such builds here you can 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:33.130
 hack, I can not even imagine in 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.890
 really now that was when 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:39.700
 50 levels i'm actually real 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.539
 allocated for almost every class 2 3 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.780
 build version 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:48.119
 I was sure of them that is these here 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:54.310
 builds principle nothing else is needed 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:56.950
 but now 1.2 look and tested 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.619
 understand that there are builds here 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.619
 Mind them and you can’t even imagine 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:05.170
 how much I tested so far 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.030
 mercenary just tortured as I 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.929
 blocked the builds you just don't 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.470
 imagine 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:13.690
 and 55 skills and I want to take in these 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.870
 branches want to go to the other naturally 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.810
 that build which is now open to me 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.599
 definitely not a major plus now under 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:27.400
 the arena will need to do separate builds 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:29.650
 under bg separate beat added arena v 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.319
 1.2 videos from the arena 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.480
 in principle, the channel is already there and will be 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:37.239
 still laid out my fights in the arena 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.730
 so the build for the arena also has 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.290
 a certain scheme in general is exactly 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.090
 this is the most variation to me 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.299
 liked the number of hp 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.700
 as well as these fps it became much more 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:51.400
 the trick is that herd stamina 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.890
 now gives 12 health points 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.849
 You 'll see, I have 515 you on 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:01.810
 only 20,000 and n well understood at super 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:06.370
 Kaifu Bakhin of damage do not panic 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:10.329
 damage I think you all saw 434 with 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.939
 one-handed fi free spear in what chip 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:16.000
 I already told in the podcasts in 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:19.120
 that raised the damage all fluff that's what 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.099
 it poured 434 home before me 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.810
 so much was just under the ministry on 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:26.680
 glass of the tenth degree 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:30.430
 overload but am am cut off 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:33.519
 power of crit as much as twice 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.680
 critical melee damage 58 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.959
 percent is eight percent due 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.329
 the fact that I put the runes 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:43.720
 what is the rune but it is already bug TCP 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:50.139
 giving 16 gives 8 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:53.079
 written 16 gives 8 as it was so 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:55.000
 Dad became basically still give 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:57.180
 probably got longer 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.349
 that is what they wanted to achieve 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.169
 developers would like to achieve that 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:05.819
 that priests were long they basically 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:10.349
 this was achieved kp became more damage 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:13.299
 It would not be superfluous to cut it 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:16.209
 led in general all classes to a single 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:21.270
 50 percent power 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:24.210
 kretov so let's say since the balance 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:27.510
 what's next 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:30.960
 innovation but you know 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:33.800
 buffs yes there new this here it is all not 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.000
 scary thing 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.010
 In principle, this is ok. 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.500
 bafov much more will be that is what 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:44.150
 new I noticed it of course 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.419
 an abundance of buffs that is, there will be such 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.719
 elixir hot blood a lot of all sorts 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.990
 Buns can be purchased from the quartermaster 

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:56.150
 necessarily 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:58.569
 still talk about it well, that is not even 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:03.169
 I know write your questions in the comments 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:07.280
 Of course, I am very interested specifically 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:09.439
 find out what you don’t understand 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.050
 Version 1.2 I will gladly do this to you 

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:14.000
 answer but for now 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.699
 summing up the next dad become 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.830
 really longer it is good classes 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:22.400
 from the balance whether the mechanics of many, many 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:25.039
 skills pokromsali but not super too straight 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.849
 critical and of course now builds 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:28.340
 will be a bunch 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:29.930
 get used to protein will be unreal 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.150
 number and each character 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:35.599
 respectively, will be different this 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.699
 well there will be no clones this is the most important thing 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:39.800
 because I have not realistic and that infuriates 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:40.699
 there everyone runs around with one hitting the house and 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.770
 rejoice 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:44.360
 your character can not highlight 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.039
 now you can create a real tone 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.129
 build that will be right for you 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:51.500
 and that's what I'll tell you about the band I'm crazy 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:53.529
 I do not know how to bind 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:58.219
 this plan of course sinha came 

00:05:53.529 --> 00:06:00.889
 tortured is unreal if the brothers are very 

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:03.469
 I have a lot of new assets 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:06.560
 there is not enough idea how to bind everything here 

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:07.789
 both here to put everything Well 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.919
 dear friends with you was a fishing line 

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:13.870
 subscribe to the channel do not forget 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:13.870
 Like to meet again
