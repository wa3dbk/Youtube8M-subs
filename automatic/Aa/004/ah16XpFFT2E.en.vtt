about using taxpayer dollars to do that
here's<00:01:31.229> Congressman<00:01:31.950> Mike<00:01:32.100> Pence<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:33.350> think

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
here's Congressman Mike Pence I think

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.020 
here's Congressman Mike Pence I think
they're<00:01:34.500> destroying<00:01:34.920> an<00:01:35.159> innocent<00:01:35.310> human

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
they're destroying an innocent human

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.640 
they're destroying an innocent human
life<00:01:36.060> is<00:01:36.360> morally<00:01:36.750> wrong<00:01:36.930> but<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.200> also<00:01:37.409> think

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
life is morally wrong but I also think

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.469 
life is morally wrong but I also think
it's<00:01:37.860> morally<00:01:38.280> wrong<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.700> take<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.000> taxpayer

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
it's morally wrong to take the taxpayer

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.030 
it's morally wrong to take the taxpayer
dollars<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:40.079> millions<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.590> pro-life

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
dollars of millions of pro-life

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.910 
dollars of millions of pro-life
Americans<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:42.299> use<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.320> fund<00:01:43.500> research

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
Americans and use it to fund research

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.130 
Americans and use it to fund research
that<00:01:43.979> involves<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.759> destruction<00:01:45.329> of<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:46.020> human

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
that involves the destruction of a human

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.160 
that involves the destruction of a human
embryo<00:01:46.649> in<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:46.950> name<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.310> science<00:01:47.720> and<00:01:48.720> as<00:01:48.990> you

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
embryo in the name of science and as you

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.359 
embryo in the name of science and as you
mentioned<00:01:49.320> they're<00:01:49.590> very<00:01:49.770> busy<00:01:49.920> up<00:01:50.130> here<00:01:50.159> on

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.460 
mentioned they're very busy up here on
the<00:01:50.460> hill<00:01:50.549> so<00:01:50.759> we'll<00:01:50.909> see<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.570> very<00:01:52.229> short

time<00:01:52.590> they<00:01:52.740> have<00:01:52.890> whether<00:01:53.100> they<00:01:53.250> get<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.490> this

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
time they have whether they get to this
