higher<00:00:48.989> volume<00:00:49.500> situations<00:00:51.260> so<00:00:52.260> let's<00:00:52.410> start

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
higher volume situations so let's start

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.510 
higher volume situations so let's start
from<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.309> from<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.180> top<00:00:54.390> camp<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:55.520> tutors

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
from the from the top camp the tutors

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.810 
from the from the top camp the tutors
are<00:00:57.320> mini<00:00:58.320> tuners<00:00:58.739> sealed<00:00:59.070> with<00:00:59.280> large<00:00:59.520> kidney

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
are mini tuners sealed with large kidney

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.500 
are mini tuners sealed with large kidney
notes<00:01:00.180> they<00:01:00.449> work<00:01:00.660> very<00:01:00.930> well<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.800> neck<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.510> a

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
notes they work very well the neck is a

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.660 
notes they work very well the neck is a
mahogany<00:01:03.719> neck<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.470> think<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:04.920> doesn't<00:01:05.189> stay<00:01:05.640> on

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
mahogany neck I think it doesn't stay on

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.929 
mahogany neck I think it doesn't stay on
the<00:01:05.909> spectrum<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.720> looks<00:01:06.900> like<00:01:06.960> mahogany

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
the spectrum so it looks like mahogany

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:13.370 
the spectrum so it looks like mahogany
which<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:10.460> acoustic<00:01:11.460> guitar<00:01:11.970> shape<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.170> mean

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
which is a acoustic guitar shape I mean

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.950 
which is a acoustic guitar shape I mean
this<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.830> all<00:01:14.460> intense<00:01:14.909> purposes<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.509> acoustic

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
this is all intense purposes in acoustic

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.320 
this is all intense purposes in acoustic
guitar<00:01:16.229> do<00:01:16.409> not<00:01:16.590> get<00:01:16.970> fooled<00:01:17.970> by<00:01:18.119> the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
guitar do not get fooled by the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.080 
guitar do not get fooled by the
synthetic<00:01:19.049> back<00:01:19.320> it's<00:01:19.619> still<00:01:19.890> its<00:01:20.640> mission<00:01:21.000> in

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
synthetic back it's still its mission in

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.760 
synthetic back it's still its mission in
life<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.479> produce<00:01:21.720> an<00:01:22.020> acoustic<00:01:22.470> guitar

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
life is to produce an acoustic guitar

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.830 
life is to produce an acoustic guitar
sound<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.400> feel<00:01:23.759> like<00:01:23.970> an<00:01:24.150> acoustic<00:01:24.360> guitar

the<00:01:41.260> body<00:01:41.470> as<00:01:41.770> I<00:01:41.800> mentioned<00:01:42.400> synthetic<00:01:43.000> back

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
the body as I mentioned synthetic back

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.710 
the body as I mentioned synthetic back
but<00:01:44.170> on<00:01:44.290> top<00:01:44.470> of<00:01:44.530> that<00:01:44.830> is<00:01:45.070> setting<00:01:45.520> the<00:01:46.450> tone

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720

of<00:04:39.680> a<00:04:39.800> job<00:04:39.919> to<00:04:40.130> get<00:04:40.280> the<00:04:40.400> thing<00:04:40.610> back<00:04:41.210> out<00:04:41.389> and

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
of a job to get the thing back out and

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.680 
of a job to get the thing back out and
reconnected<00:04:42.800> so<00:04:43.580> as<00:04:44.240> far<00:04:44.479> as<00:04:44.599> your

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
reconnected so as far as your

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.659 
reconnected so as far as your
maintenance<00:04:45.050> routine<00:04:45.380> maybe<00:04:45.830> one<00:04:46.070> you<00:04:46.250> change

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
maintenance routine maybe one you change

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.730 
maintenance routine maybe one you change
the<00:04:46.789> strings<00:04:47.120> just<00:04:47.360> tighten<00:04:48.020> that<00:04:48.080> nut<00:04:48.409> there

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
the strings just tighten that nut there

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.879 
the strings just tighten that nut there
and<00:04:49.099> I'll<00:04:49.220> save<00:04:49.430> yourself<00:04:49.820> a<00:04:49.880> nightmare<00:04:50.360> but

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
and I'll save yourself a nightmare but

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:55.180 
and I'll save yourself a nightmare but
if<00:04:51.889> you<00:04:52.010> do<00:04:52.190> that<00:04:52.570> okay<00:04:53.570> so<00:04:53.630> the<00:04:54.470> sound<00:04:54.800> of<00:04:55.070> the

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
if you do that okay so the sound of the

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.839 
if you do that okay so the sound of the
thing<00:04:55.460> is<00:04:57.250> lean<00:04:58.250> its<00:04:58.610> it's<00:04:58.909> designed<00:04:59.840> for

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:00.849 
thing is lean its it's designed for

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:09.210 
thing is lean its it's designed for
amplification<00:05:01.849> so<00:05:02.659> it's<00:05:03.080> acoustic<00:05:03.680> sound

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.860 

although<00:05:10.220> Pleasants<00:05:10.910> listen<00:05:11.270> to<00:05:11.419> doesn't

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
although Pleasants listen to doesn't

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.370 
although Pleasants listen to doesn't
have<00:05:12.080> the<00:05:12.199> volume<00:05:12.590> that<00:05:12.919> a<00:05:13.210> conventional

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
have the volume that a conventional

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.370 
have the volume that a conventional
wooden<00:05:15.380> body<00:05:15.620> would<00:05:15.949> would<00:05:16.250> give<00:05:16.550> to<00:05:16.580> it<00:05:16.910> so

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
wooden body would would give to it so

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.230 
wooden body would would give to it so
it's<00:05:18.380> really<00:05:18.770> something<00:05:19.130> that<00:05:19.400> if<00:05:19.970> you're

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
it's really something that if you're

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.999 
it's really something that if you're
going<00:05:20.419> to<00:05:20.539> buy<00:05:20.720> an<00:05:20.780> electric<00:05:21.020> is<00:05:21.410> with<00:05:21.770> a<00:05:21.800> bowl

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:22.009 
going to buy an electric is with a bowl

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:24.040 
going to buy an electric is with a bowl
back<00:05:22.250> you<00:05:22.550> need<00:05:22.759> to<00:05:22.940> be<00:05:23.030> using<00:05:23.419> it<00:05:23.539> amplified

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
back you need to be using it amplified

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.590 
back you need to be using it amplified
for<00:05:24.380> the<00:05:24.620> majority<00:05:25.130> of<00:05:25.160> time<00:05:25.460> let's<00:05:26.180> find<00:05:26.419> the

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
for the majority of time let's find the

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.080 
for the majority of time let's find the
practice<00:05:27.110> reversals<00:05:27.889> and<00:05:28.550> you<00:05:28.669> might<00:05:28.850> get

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
practice reversals and you might get

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.960 
practice reversals and you might get
away<00:05:29.330> with<00:05:29.570> accompanying<00:05:30.110> one<00:05:30.410> voice<00:05:30.710> on<00:05:31.039> that

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
away with accompanying one voice on that

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.900 
away with accompanying one voice on that
volume<00:05:32.180> level<00:05:32.919> but<00:05:33.919> let's<00:05:34.130> put<00:05:34.460> it<00:05:34.520> through<00:05:34.759> an

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
volume level but let's put it through an

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.800 
volume level but let's put it through an
amplifier<00:05:35.030> now<00:05:35.509> and<00:05:36.789> let<00:05:37.789> you<00:05:37.910> listen<00:05:38.060> to<00:05:38.270> the

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
amplifier now and let you listen to the

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:51.350 
amplifier now and let you listen to the
to<00:05:39.259> the<00:05:39.380> true<00:05:39.590> voice<00:05:39.770> of<00:05:40.039> the<00:05:40.160> thing

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:06:01.090 

you

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:01.100 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:29.930 

hahaha

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.700 

I'm<00:06:30.940> running<00:06:31.270> that<00:06:31.450> flat<00:06:31.780> so<00:06:32.260> I'll<00:06:32.380> just<00:06:32.530> give

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:32.710 
I'm running that flat so I'll just give

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.690 
I'm running that flat so I'll just give
you<00:06:32.830> a<00:06:32.890> quick<00:06:33.190> idea<00:06:33.640> of<00:06:34.030> the<00:06:34.650> the<00:06:35.650> scope<00:06:36.280> of<00:06:36.520> the

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:36.700 
you a quick idea of the the scope of the

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:48.140 
you a quick idea of the the scope of the
EQ<00:06:37.120> so<00:06:39.690> nice<00:06:44.010> and<00:06:45.010> full<00:06:45.250> cut<00:06:45.580> on<00:06:45.760> the<00:06:45.850> base<00:06:46.030> but

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.150 
EQ so nice and full cut on the base but

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.970 
EQ so nice and full cut on the base but
that<00:06:49.150> back<00:06:49.570> flat<00:06:49.960> will<00:06:50.170> do<00:06:50.320> the<00:06:50.440> same<00:06:50.650> of<00:06:50.890> the

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:50.980 
that back flat will do the same of the

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:56.220 
that back flat will do the same of the
middle<00:06:51.310> full<00:06:52.300> boost<00:06:52.540> on<00:06:52.750> the<00:06:52.840> middle<00:06:54.900> or<00:06:55.900> top

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:56.230 
middle full boost on the middle or top

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:01.500 
middle full boost on the middle or top
of<00:06:56.290> the<00:06:56.500> middle

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:01.510 

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:08.689 

all<00:07:02.510> based<00:07:02.780> on<00:07:02.990> the<00:07:03.080> travel<00:07:06.460> beauty

00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:08.699 
all based on the travel beauty

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:15.559 
all based on the travel beauty
full<00:07:09.419> cut<00:07:09.719> on<00:07:09.930> the<00:07:09.990> travel<00:07:12.229> back<00:07:13.229> flat<00:07:14.569> give

00:07:15.559 --> 00:07:15.569 
full cut on the travel back flat give

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:18.080 
full cut on the travel back flat give
you<00:07:15.659> an<00:07:15.719> idea<00:07:15.870> that's<00:07:16.379> scoop<00:07:16.830> so<00:07:17.669> this<00:07:17.819> is<00:07:17.939> this

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:18.090 
you an idea that's scoop so this is this

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:20.959 
you an idea that's scoop so this is this
without<00:07:19.020> scoop<00:07:19.499> scoop<00:07:19.830> us<00:07:19.979> flat<00:07:20.310> which<00:07:20.669> screen

00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:20.969 
without scoop scoop us flat which screen

00:07:20.969 --> 00:07:25.249 
without scoop scoop us flat which screen
left<00:07:21.180> of<00:07:21.419> the<00:07:21.479> slider<00:07:23.629> and<00:07:24.629> this<00:07:24.779> is<00:07:24.960> to<00:07:25.139> the

00:07:25.249 --> 00:07:25.259 
left of the slider and this is to the

00:07:25.259 --> 00:07:31.920 
left of the slider and this is to the
extreme<00:07:25.529> right

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:31.930 

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:36.860 

I<00:07:33.240> think<00:07:34.240> it<00:07:34.570> gives<00:07:34.810> it<00:07:35.080> a<00:07:35.380> kind<00:07:35.889> of<00:07:36.220> studio

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:36.870 
I think it gives it a kind of studio

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:43.420 
I think it gives it a kind of studio
feel<00:07:37.870> to<00:07:38.470> the<00:07:38.560> Sun

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:43.430 

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:47.480 

they<00:07:44.430> mess<00:07:44.669> with<00:07:44.699> the<00:07:44.969> scheme<00:07:45.860> that's<00:07:46.860> it<00:07:47.159> for

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:47.490 
they mess with the scheme that's it for

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:51.740 
they mess with the scheme that's it for
the<00:07:47.669> for<00:07:48.330> the<00:07:48.479> crafter<00:07:49.110> FX<00:07:49.500> 550<00:07:50.280> it's<00:07:51.000> a<00:07:51.180> sweet

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:51.750 
the for the crafter FX 550 it's a sweet

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.779 
the for the crafter FX 550 it's a sweet
little<00:07:51.840> machine<00:07:52.469> if<00:07:52.710> it's<00:07:53.129> going<00:07:53.340> to<00:07:53.400> fill<00:07:53.639> the

00:07:53.779 --> 00:07:53.789 
little machine if it's going to fill the

little machine if it's going to fill the
job<00:07:54.030> that<00:07:54.180> you<00:07:54.300> want<00:07:54.419> it<00:07:54.629> to<00:07:54.750> do<00:07:54.990> and<00:07:55.169> I<00:07:56.129> remind

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:56.520 
job that you want it to do and I remind

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.080 
job that you want it to do and I remind
you<00:07:56.610> again<00:07:56.699> that<00:07:56.939> that<00:07:57.240> is<00:07:58.069> amplified

you again that that is amplified

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:02.119 
you again that that is amplified
acoustic<00:08:00.090> sounds<00:08:00.509> rather<00:08:01.199> than<00:08:01.560> just
