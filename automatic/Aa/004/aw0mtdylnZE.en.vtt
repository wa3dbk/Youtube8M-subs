00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.390
 hi to all and mobile test axel 

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.780
 point is made we are at cska las vegas 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.160
 and 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:13.650
 in the hand 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.629
 the catel one touch hd which is all 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.560
 last terminal announced by alcatel 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.210
 with 1 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.710
 big size it's 1.5 inches will have 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.370
 passed quickly on the specs were the 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.010
 it 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:26.650
 all hdi ps at the display level a 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.400
 quad core processor 1.2 yesterday 's tone in 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.620
 under jelly bean 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.820
 we have an 8 megapixel camera with 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.510
 flash led 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.300
 we have a front camera 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.699
 3 megapixel which also films in 720p 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.690
 it's a device that looks like dual sim in 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:42.079
 any case in this version the version 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.060
 why here 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.560
 and what else 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.240
 from game to only internal memory 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.750
 you can put a microsd increase 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.960
 up to 32 in addition to 34 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.450
 at the level of said 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.860
 and then alcatel the present as a 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:00.420
 extremely thin terminal and it's true 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.840
 that look at these pictures I believe that 45 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.670
 mm 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:08.130
 a sum he's my finer than 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.689
 f s is the largest which is tf1 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.130
 It was announced as the 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.600
 terminal finer apparently this would 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.060
 this one but hey that's not necessarily 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.870
 important at design level if enough 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.450
 pretty basic but I 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.750
 what makes rolex or english 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.810
 see that we 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.140
 COQUANT 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.360
 plastic here 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.550
 neither boli you see here the battery has not 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.290
 look to be removable and in this 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.970
 white version is rather nice 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.710
 there are other versions also with 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.140
 other colors and you 'll see it in 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.090
 the photos on test mobile.fr so there we 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.710
 has the big screen 5 inches with the camera 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.960
 frontal on the top we have no 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.159
 dedicated button 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.510
 downstairs since it was the tone that 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.290
 then add in the interface of 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.290
 this way 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.280
 nothing to report down by another 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.750
 we have the port 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.940
 pau sd 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.500
 volume the patent button one has all the 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.490
 button to lock it unlock the 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.580
 jack 3.5 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.380
 there we have two slots for 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.840
 the tops 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.720
 micro usb white micro usb the device 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.290
 8 megapixel photo 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.040
 and 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.970
 flash led talk to us downstairs and that's to 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.610
 just about everything we will get into 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.650
 the interface and I thought it according 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.250
 a first cancellation was made 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.490
 relatively interesting 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.490
 with 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.900
 all nice 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.760
 but pretty simple enough 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.260
 we knew 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.519
 we'll watch a little bit of it 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.049
 I discover in as many days so we 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.459
 the notifications drawer here with 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.980
 some features built in there 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.120
 notebook to quickly check 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.000
 different by May 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.290
 there we would have 2 slots sim that will rise from 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.530
 notification that show that there is 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.060
 two sim slots 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.739
 m 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.330
 jelly bean normally we can render in 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.730
 81 points 2 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.319
 pop the entrance in mine 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.030
 a little bit it's basic it's just 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.610
 that the icons have been changed are 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.739
 rather pretty there is a whole series 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.480
 installed application tricks that 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.019
 finally do that are relative to the market 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.840
 Chinese 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:06.340
 because we are on the tcl booth 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.769
 after man is the distributor 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.020
 10 million in China and I'm not too 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:14.340
 sure to be international 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.340
 we have different widgets here 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.300
 that of the year 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.300
 does not happen 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.319
 see the straw of blisters and so on 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.000
 it's all Chinese och in the aura 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.450
 surely not 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.450
 I go 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.730
 at 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.510
 like that I did not interfere with these guys 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.510
 ear lobes widgets 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.360
 we have some applications 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:39.159
 again if the applications 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.870
 China will not linger on it 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:42.140
 I'm really not sure we'll have them 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.190
 la France 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.959
 the paris photo interface that is 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.900
 rather nice years for a very video 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.470
 quickly here it looks like 80 in 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.510
 picture like that 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.250
 the plug and quickly that way there 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.170
 it's due to the project mode 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:02.340
 a little 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.340
 what do we have some titles 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.730
 what it is 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.340
 his profile 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.910
 we can change different options here 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.910
 also 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.070
 time lapse why not 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.940
 at 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.240
 it's pretty basic 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.600
 and what more can I say about what we did 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.160
 pretty much always go see equalizes 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.990
 do not 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.340
 the music player is basic 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.410
 also but it works pretty well 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.760
 bounce and for his bikes the script that 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.920
 seems like a term to a terminal 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.570
 a terminal with a big screen a 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.680
 nice resolution I do not know what you 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.270
 see there we do not really not 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.430
 distinguish the pixels on 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.520
 on a hd a game that's exactly where 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.720
 I 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.270
 and then after behind we have a 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.660
 little really light overcoat almost 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.460
 mine 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.280
 distant with here in any case beautiful 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.389
 icons it looks very fluid to me so 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.000
 no it must be a pretty device 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:03.270
 interesting and I saw that I have in 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.440
 is right next door 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.550
 you can not see it but wait 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.440
 it's OK 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.900
 m 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.880
 if we see a little pen and I believe 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.289
 that of course it will not be provided with my 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.169
 salads is an accessory 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:19.820
 with one side pens and the other side 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:21.260
 stylus for for 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.180
 it seems to be interesting that 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:26.009
 device looks good and 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.139
 thing but an error on the spectra 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:28.759
 his limits 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:30.160
 he is master leray quarantine so 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:32.409
 it's the ape 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.950
 an interesting sonia comes from 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:36.440
 series they hoped 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:38.450
 - and it's true that I could have 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.620
 realize myself and I looked 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.200
 aside I feel like they were 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.240
 Women and liabilities of that and I a 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.620
 think you may have noticed 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.050
 surely scream towards your screen 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.909
 of mistakes 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.670
 ok so that's how much you say sonia 1.8 

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:51.550
 point 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:55.510
 8 points 5 mm and passive for 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.800
 4 sorry for the small mistake of friends 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.700
 Corsican and another from alcatel who 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.110
 is very very hungry and we will see him 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.110
 surely just after May 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.330
 ok I hope this video has you 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.330
 more and I'll see you soon
