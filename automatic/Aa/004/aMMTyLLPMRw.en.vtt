00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.619
 whole control system with a transport 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:35.070
 even 3 inch display and this beautiful 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.079
 display has enough space to bailing out 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.000
 objectively display data so a 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.160
 integrated lens data display 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.870
 I also have the index of glendon 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.760
 slider here directly on the display 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.559
 I have my focus here 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.989
 I can marca for me 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.019
 the focus and if I have such a 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.239
 Marker Ride vibrates the handle lightly 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:58.589
 that means i feel this market too 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.079
 if I do not look at the others 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:03.030
 then I have an alexa here 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.250
 status display and it will also be possible 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.860
 be the alexa camera with this unit 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.300
 adjust so speak the framerate 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.520
 adjust the cutter angle 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.100

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.439

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.170
 So the focus button with a 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.630
 adjustable friction dazzle slider 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.189
 and here a little button on the 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.620
 side, the unit has a small 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.240
 red button so 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.520
 a freely assignable button because I could 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.320
 tell me that if I'm on it 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.200
 put a focus mark on me 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.180

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.840

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.120

 we have a sd-card slot here 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.270
 means if you update the hand unit 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.370
 you do not need special ones 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.310
 cable more for but you can do it completely 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.420
 simply over the sd map make 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.400
 at the same time you can get the 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.110

 tight is the slider here has none 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.140
