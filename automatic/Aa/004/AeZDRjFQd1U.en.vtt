engine failure landings I'm here to

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:06.039 
engine failure landings I'm here to
challenge<00:00:04.580> you<00:00:04.850> to<00:00:05.149> try<00:00:05.359> one<00:00:05.390> of<00:00:05.720> the<00:00:05.839> most

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:06.049 
challenge you to try one of the most

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:08.259 
challenge you to try one of the most
difficult<00:00:06.290> failures<00:00:06.950> out<00:00:07.129> there<00:00:07.370> a<00:00:07.549> double

difficult failures out there a double

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:22.640 
difficult failures out there a double

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.410 

for<00:00:23.650> this<00:00:23.770> tutorial<00:00:24.310> I<00:00:24.460> will<00:00:24.550> be<00:00:24.940> using<00:00:25.150> the

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420 
for this tutorial I will be using the

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.410 
for this tutorial I will be using the
Boeing<00:00:25.750> 787-8<00:00:26.620> in<00:00:26.890> the<00:00:27.400> previous<00:00:27.820> tutorial<00:00:28.270> I

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.420 
Boeing 787-8 in the previous tutorial I

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.600 
Boeing 787-8 in the previous tutorial I
used<00:00:28.720> the<00:00:28.960> triple<00:00:29.380> 7<00:00:29.680> because<00:00:30.040> it's<00:00:30.190> the<00:00:30.370> most

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.610 
used the triple 7 because it's the most

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.670 
used the triple 7 because it's the most
commonly<00:00:31.060> used<00:00:31.180> airliner<00:00:31.960> in<00:00:32.230> flight<00:00:32.470> gear

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
commonly used airliner in flight gear

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.340 
commonly used airliner in flight gear
but<00:00:33.310> I'm<00:00:33.430> using<00:00:33.670> the<00:00:33.940> 787<00:00:34.690> now<00:00:34.840> for<00:00:35.110> two

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
but I'm using the 787 now for two

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.190 
but I'm using the 787 now for two
reasons<00:00:35.920> one<00:00:36.340> is<00:00:36.580> because<00:00:37.000> the<00:00:37.450> plane<00:00:37.720> systems

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200 
reasons one is because the plane systems

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.440 
reasons one is because the plane systems
are<00:00:38.410> ahead<00:00:38.739> of<00:00:39.040> the<00:00:39.190> triple<00:00:39.610> 7<00:00:39.940> system<00:00:40.300> in

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450 
are ahead of the triple 7 system in

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.510 
are ahead of the triple 7 system in
flight<00:00:40.690> gear<00:00:40.900> and<00:00:41.110> 2<00:00:41.559> because<00:00:41.890> for<00:00:42.340> some

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
flight gear and 2 because for some

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.520 
flight gear and 2 because for some
reason<00:00:42.550> my<00:00:43.150> flight<00:00:43.480> gear<00:00:43.690> is<00:00:43.809> broken<00:00:44.110> and<00:00:44.380> will

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
reason my flight gear is broken and will

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.620 
reason my flight gear is broken and will
only<00:00:44.710> allow<00:00:44.980> me<00:00:45.309> to<00:00:45.340> use<00:00:45.640> certain<00:00:45.910> planes<00:00:46.330> and

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:46.630 
only allow me to use certain planes and

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.190 
only allow me to use certain planes and
the<00:00:47.200> triple<00:00:47.559> 7<00:00:47.830> is<00:00:48.010> not<00:00:48.309> on<00:00:48.489> that<00:00:48.700> list<00:00:49.050> it's<00:00:50.050> a

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.200 
the triple 7 is not on that list it's a

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.990 
the triple 7 is not on that list it's a
long<00:00:50.380> story<00:00:50.590> and<00:00:50.739> I<00:00:50.950> won't<00:00:51.100> try<00:00:51.309> to<00:00:51.430> bother<00:00:51.730> you

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
long story and I won't try to bother you

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.870 
long story and I won't try to bother you
with<00:00:52.180> it<00:00:52.239> in<00:00:52.570> this<00:00:52.780> video<00:00:53.490> there<00:00:54.490> are<00:00:54.640> many

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:54.880 
with it in this video there are many

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.970 
with it in this video there are many
ways<00:00:55.090> to<00:00:55.150> simulate<00:00:55.690> a<00:00:55.900> double<00:00:56.380> engine<00:00:56.650> failure

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
ways to simulate a double engine failure

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.970 
ways to simulate a double engine failure
and<00:00:57.130> flag<00:00:57.340> gear<00:00:57.550> some<00:00:58.390> planes<00:00:58.630> like<00:00:58.930> this<00:00:59.140> 787

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
and flag gear some planes like this 787

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.800 
and flag gear some planes like this 787
will<00:01:00.340> actually<00:01:00.730> simulate<00:01:01.180> the<00:01:01.360> breakdown<00:01:01.780> of

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
will actually simulate the breakdown of

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.530 
will actually simulate the breakdown of
engines<00:01:02.380> when<00:01:02.740> you<00:01:02.860> overheat<00:01:03.400> them<00:01:03.610> but<00:01:04.330> for

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
engines when you overheat them but for

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.870 
engines when you overheat them but for
all<00:01:04.660> planes<00:01:04.930> the<00:01:05.290> easiest<00:01:05.740> way<00:01:06.009> is<00:01:06.220> to<00:01:06.610> just

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
all planes the easiest way is to just

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.260 
all planes the easiest way is to just
use<00:01:07.030> the<00:01:07.450> failures<00:01:07.960> menu<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:09.729> will<00:01:09.910> very

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
use the failures menu that will very

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.570 
use the failures menu that will very
likely<00:01:10.390> work<00:01:11.020> for<00:01:11.530> every<00:01:11.860> single<00:01:12.100> plane<00:01:12.400> in

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
likely work for every single plane in

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.490 
likely work for every single plane in
flight<00:01:12.670> gear<00:01:13.000> so<00:01:13.540> I'm<00:01:13.780> going<00:01:14.110> ahead<00:01:14.200> and

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
flight gear so I'm going ahead and

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.820 
flight gear so I'm going ahead and
disable<00:01:14.830> my<00:01:15.220> two<00:01:15.280> engines<00:01:15.880> right<00:01:16.090> now<00:01:16.770> now<00:01:17.770> the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
disable my two engines right now now the

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.070 
disable my two engines right now now the
first<00:01:18.399> thing<00:01:18.670> you<00:01:18.910> will<00:01:19.090> have<00:01:19.180> to<00:01:19.240> do<00:01:19.570> as<00:01:19.810> the

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
first thing you will have to do as the

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.650 
first thing you will have to do as the
engine<00:01:20.440> failure<00:01:20.649> occurs<00:01:21.220> is<00:01:21.880> making<00:01:22.390> sure

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
engine failure occurs is making sure

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.170 
engine failure occurs is making sure
your<00:01:22.990> plane<00:01:23.259> is<00:01:23.470> flying<00:01:23.619> stable<00:01:24.280> if<00:01:24.640> the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
your plane is flying stable if the

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.900 
your plane is flying stable if the
autopilot<00:01:25.780> is<00:01:26.140> switched<00:01:26.380> on<00:01:26.700> disengage<00:01:27.700> it

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:27.910 
autopilot is switched on disengage it

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.809 
autopilot is switched on disengage it
and<00:01:28.030> fly<00:01:28.660> manually<00:01:29.229> on<00:01:29.410> many<00:01:30.100> planes<00:01:30.399> you<00:01:30.610> will

00:01:30.809 --> 00:01:30.819 
and fly manually on many planes you will

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:32.309 
and fly manually on many planes you will
lose<00:01:31.000> your<00:01:31.210> instruments<00:01:31.720> or<00:01:31.899> controls

00:01:32.309 --> 00:01:32.319 
lose your instruments or controls

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:34.350 
lose your instruments or controls
because<00:01:32.800> the<00:01:33.009> engines<00:01:33.369> are<00:01:33.580> not<00:01:33.789> providing

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
because the engines are not providing

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.320 
because the engines are not providing
any<00:01:34.450> electrical<00:01:35.110> power<00:01:35.350> anymore<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:37.119> make

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
any electrical power anymore so make

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.150 
any electrical power anymore so make
sure<00:01:37.360> you're<00:01:37.750> not<00:01:37.959> on<00:01:38.170> a<00:01:38.229> crash<00:01:38.530> course<00:01:38.890> and

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
sure you're not on a crash course and

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.040 
sure you're not on a crash course and
then<00:01:39.429> start<00:01:39.759> worrying<00:01:40.149> about<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.600> loss<00:01:40.899> of

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
then start worrying about the loss of

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.859 
then start worrying about the loss of
power<00:01:41.229> almost<00:01:41.920> always<00:01:42.459> airliners<00:01:43.330> have<00:01:43.539> a<00:01:43.569> so

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
power almost always airliners have a so

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.219 
power almost always airliners have a so
called<00:01:44.080> ram<00:01:44.470> air<00:01:44.800> turbine<00:01:45.280> or<00:01:45.580> rat<00:01:46.360> you<00:01:47.050> can

called ram air turbine or rat you can

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:48.960 
called ram air turbine or rat you can

activate the red on the overhead panel

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.889 
activate the red on the overhead panel

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
turbine it can provide power to make

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.699 
turbine it can provide power to make
sure<00:02:04.090> you<00:02:04.300> can<00:02:04.479> still<00:02:04.720> control<00:02:05.050> the<00:02:05.229> plane<00:02:05.470> and

00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:05.709 
sure you can still control the plane and

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:07.680 
sure you can still control the plane and
to<00:02:05.950> keep<00:02:06.099> the<00:02:06.280> instruments<00:02:06.759> working<00:02:06.970> but<00:02:07.569> to

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
to keep the instruments working but to

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.089 
to keep the instruments working but to
make<00:02:07.869> sure<00:02:08.110> the<00:02:08.319> instruments<00:02:08.800> keep<00:02:08.950> on

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
make sure the instruments keep on

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.220 
make sure the instruments keep on
working<00:02:09.459> you<00:02:10.119> will<00:02:10.270> have<00:02:10.450> to<00:02:10.599> switch<00:02:10.899> on<00:02:11.110> the

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
working you will have to switch on the

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.250 
working you will have to switch on the
APU<00:02:11.590> or<00:02:12.130> auxiliary<00:02:12.970> power<00:02:13.240> unit<00:02:13.780> of<00:02:13.990> the

so<00:02:16.590> now<00:02:16.800> do<00:02:16.860> you<00:02:17.130> have<00:02:17.310> enough<00:02:17.610> power<00:02:17.790> to

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
so now do you have enough power to

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.240 
so now do you have enough power to
control<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.569> plane<00:02:18.780> it<00:02:19.290> is<00:02:19.410> time<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.860> find<00:02:20.100> a

safe place to bring down the plane onto

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.170 
safe place to bring down the plane onto
a<00:02:22.290> flat<00:02:22.620> surface<00:02:22.890> I<00:02:23.280> don't<00:02:23.790> think<00:02:24.030> it's

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
a flat surface I don't think it's

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.210 
a flat surface I don't think it's
necessary<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.959> tell<00:02:25.170> you<00:02:25.350> that<00:02:25.740> it<00:02:25.890> would<00:02:26.069> be

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
necessary to tell you that it would be

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.449 
necessary to tell you that it would be
best<00:02:26.459> if<00:02:26.700> that<00:02:27.030> surface<00:02:27.480> were<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.900> be<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.080> runway

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
best if that surface were to be a runway

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.580 
best if that surface were to be a runway
but<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.700> Airbus<00:02:30.090> a320<00:02:30.600> showed<00:02:31.110> that<00:02:31.410> the

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
Hudson River is also an option anyways

you may know every plane has a maximum
landing<00:03:40.410> weight<00:03:40.850> this<00:03:41.850> is<00:03:42.060> because<00:03:42.420> of<00:03:42.540> stall

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
landing weight this is because of stall

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.040 
landing weight this is because of stall
speeds<00:03:43.170> and<00:03:43.440> braking<00:03:43.860> power<00:03:44.010> of<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.459> plane

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
also landing a light plane can be easier

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.780 
also landing a light plane can be easier
than<00:03:48.480> landing<00:03:48.870> a<00:03:48.989> heavy<00:03:49.200> plane<00:03:49.500> so<00:03:50.430> in<00:03:50.640> the

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790

I'm keeping an eye out for the fewer

the<00:04:11.310> runway<00:04:11.720> this<00:04:12.720> requires<00:04:13.200> even<00:04:13.530> more

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
the runway this requires even more

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.949 
the runway this requires even more
practice<00:04:14.340> than<00:04:14.610> for<00:04:15.000> example<00:04:15.090> learn<00:04:15.660> how<00:04:15.930> to

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
practice than for example learn how to

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.800 
practice than for example learn how to
your<00:04:16.229> crosswind<00:04:16.739> landings<00:04:17.160> I've<00:04:17.570> never<00:04:18.570> got

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
your crosswind landings I've never got

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.990 
your crosswind landings I've never got
this<00:04:18.989> perfectly<00:04:19.500> right<00:04:19.799> and<00:04:20.010> I'm<00:04:20.400> not<00:04:20.609> sure<00:04:20.820> if

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
this perfectly right and I'm not sure if

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.810 
this perfectly right and I'm not sure if
I'm<00:04:21.150> doing<00:04:21.540> exactly<00:04:21.750> what<00:04:22.820> professional

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
I'm doing exactly what professional

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.719 
I'm doing exactly what professional
pilots<00:04:24.240> would<00:04:24.419> do<00:04:24.890> but<00:04:25.890> it<00:04:26.010> works<00:04:26.250> and<00:04:26.520> you

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
pilots would do but it works and you

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:28.820 
pilots would do but it works and you
know<00:04:26.880> what<00:04:27.060> they<00:04:27.210> say<00:04:27.479> every<00:04:28.320> landing<00:04:28.650> you<00:04:28.800> can

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
know what they say every landing you can

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.210 
know what they say every landing you can
walk<00:04:29.040> away<00:04:29.220> from<00:04:29.729> is<00:04:30.000> a<00:04:30.419> good<00:04:30.570> landing

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
walk away from is a good landing

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.920 
walk away from is a good landing
actually<00:04:32.220> I<00:04:32.250> didn't<00:04:32.669> agree<00:04:32.850> on<00:04:33.120> that<00:04:33.300> at<00:04:33.510> all<00:04:33.660> I

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
actually I didn't agree on that at all I

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.350 
actually I didn't agree on that at all I
think<00:04:34.590> it<00:04:34.890> should<00:04:35.010> be<00:04:35.070> every<00:04:35.910> landing<00:04:36.180> you<00:04:36.330> can

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
think it should be every landing you can

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.110 
think it should be every landing you can
walk<00:04:36.540> away<00:04:36.720> from<00:04:37.340> was<00:04:38.340> apparently<00:04:38.880> good

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
walk away from was apparently good

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.300 
walk away from was apparently good
enough<00:04:39.419> but<00:04:40.229> maybe<00:04:40.560> that's<00:04:40.890> just<00:04:41.100> me

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
enough but maybe that's just me

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.030 
enough but maybe that's just me
I<00:04:42.540> think<00:04:43.540> all<00:04:43.690> I<00:04:43.720> can<00:04:44.020> say<00:04:44.200> from<00:04:44.440> here<00:04:44.590> on<00:04:44.770> is

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
I think all I can say from here on is

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.690 
I think all I can say from here on is
good<00:04:45.640> luck<00:04:46.590> okay<00:04:47.590> maybe<00:04:47.830> I<00:04:47.950> can<00:04:48.250> give<00:04:48.400> you<00:04:48.520> some

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
good luck okay maybe I can give you some

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.630 
good luck okay maybe I can give you some
more<00:04:48.850> tips<00:04:49.560> as<00:04:50.560> you<00:04:50.680> can<00:04:50.830> see<00:04:51.040> I'm<00:04:51.280> trying<00:04:51.460> to

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
more tips as you can see I'm trying to

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.390 
more tips as you can see I'm trying to
start<00:04:51.970> descending<00:04:52.360> rather<00:04:52.690> late<00:04:53.400> descend

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
start descending rather late descend

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.790 
start descending rather late descend
above<00:04:54.790> the<00:04:55.030> glideslope<00:04:55.390> path<00:04:55.750> and<00:04:55.990> experiment

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
above the glideslope path and experiment

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.850 
above the glideslope path and experiment
with<00:04:57.010> what<00:04:57.340> works<00:04:57.580> best<00:04:57.910> for<00:04:58.060> each<00:04:58.270> aircraft

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
with what works best for each aircraft

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.650 
with what works best for each aircraft
after<00:04:59.860> touchdown<00:05:00.310> you<00:05:00.670> will<00:05:00.880> not<00:05:01.060> be<00:05:01.240> able<00:05:01.360> to

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
after touchdown you will not be able to

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.250 
after touchdown you will not be able to
use<00:05:01.810> the<00:05:02.110> engines<00:05:02.620> reverses<00:05:03.310> quite<00:05:03.730> obviously

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
use the engines reverses quite obviously

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.230 
use the engines reverses quite obviously
so<00:05:05.260> use<00:05:05.590> the<00:05:05.800> normal<00:05:06.160> brakes<00:05:06.400> speed<00:05:06.940> brakes

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
so use the normal brakes speed brakes

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.280 
so use the normal brakes speed brakes
and<00:05:07.480> flaps<00:05:07.960> to<00:05:08.230> slow<00:05:08.470> the<00:05:08.680> plane<00:05:08.800> down

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
and flaps to slow the plane down

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.990 
and flaps to slow the plane down
so<00:05:11.290> good<00:05:11.590> luck<00:05:11.620> practicing<00:05:12.490> your<00:05:12.670> double

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
so good luck practicing your double

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.730 
so good luck practicing your double
