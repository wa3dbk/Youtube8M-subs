00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.449
 ziganda colleagues 

00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:13.079
 I am carol in 0 9 many already know who I am employed now I am going to 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:16.079
 show how to install the new head of household 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:19.829
 saying this let's start 

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:23.239
 The first thing we will do is open the exe file that I sent to my 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:26.539
 subscribers in this beautiful file 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.630
 we select the language enters exposed Spanish 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.510
 by logic it would be Spanish 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.150
 this is a typical installation you already know what to do 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.770
 next next instance 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.140
 so that they see that it is not tricky to advance the video to me I get a 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.310
 sign because I already had it installed 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.670
 we leave the two boxes checked 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.450
 and it will open two windows to us the first one is a notebook of information of the 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.360
 pact and the second one is a decompressor 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.560
 we can close the blog notes 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.190
 then we will work on the decompressor 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.020
 we select the button that says search 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.939
 i will open another window there we put desks subject 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.070
 after completed accept 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.970
 when you finish unzipping, you will leave all the tools on the desktop 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.320
 necessary are four folders 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.120
 I want to make it clear is that the gcba that I am going to modify this is clean 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.680
 they have no voice 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.410
 if yours have 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.130
 since if they do not 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.480
 this will not work 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.570
 good open the folder that says head of aparto ur 2011 amount the first step 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.960
 to follow would be to open the folder that brings the word written in capital letters 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.150
 and we copy the file called 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.960
 blunted and ft 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.960
 and we put it inside the folder 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.410
 it's going to come out that if we want to replace them 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.390
 we click here 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.150
 we continue with the full files 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.390
 for this we will install employment 4 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.880
 also has inside the pac 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.939
 is the folder that says that I read 4 that is on the desktop 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.860
 we run the installer 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.659
 we leave the first box selected only 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:12.189
 we put the directory of our objective 

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:15.159
 and we click on next until final 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:19.650
 if we copy all the files to the folder cleo dgt here he will not ask us 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.650
 that we replace since they are dead files 

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:26.609
 continue with the data folder in uppercase 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:28.539
 inside there is a file called 

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:31.779
 in front of future we will copy it to the folder 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:35.539
 date from the low gt, so ask us to replace, we click on 

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:37.909
 follow the folder 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:43.169
 models in uppercase copy the pk file 40 points and emergent 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:46.169
 inside the folder models of our gps 

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:49.999
 we will not get the sign to replace here either 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:52.249
 we continue with the folder that says 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:54.609
 jeter 3 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:55.589
 faithfully 

00:02:55.589 --> 00:03:00.439
 there are three files and fp these we are going to put in gt to three points and emerging 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:04.049
 to open this file we will need the tsx workshop 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:06.900
 which is in the folder called get 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.149
 speech 

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:09.739
 once executed 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.419
 we select where it says 

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:15.329
 josé miguel mercedes located below españa office for those who do not speak 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:16.709
 English 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.399
 we will leave a window of exploitation we go to the directory 

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:23.399
 gps root we select the folder 

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:27.749
 and within them we select the file president jeter 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:30.729
 the mosquito 

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:35.549
 after that we go to the button that says action by giving it order and mg and 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:36.909
 we select a 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:40.669
 we look for the three files and exercise the modín we click on and 

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:45.559
 that's how fast we're almost done, we're only one step away 

00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:51.639
 then once delivered the files we just closed the secrecy said that 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:54.639
 we are ready to run the game 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.519
 It is highly recommended that you make a backup copy of all the files before 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.119
 to replace them 

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:03.049
 once done this if I continued 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.060
 my instructions to the letter does not have to present said 

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:12.789
 I almost forgot to tell you that this tutorial also works to install 

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:14.869
 on motorcycles 

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:18.989
 then run the game to verify that no error arises and does not send the 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.329
 famous notice of 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:21.780
 fcc has presented 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.789
 a problem after closing in case it reaches them 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.729
 or do not despair and start from the beginning 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.310
 well with this it showed them that it is possible there is no train inc 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:38.189
 so if you do not boot them look well sales instruction 

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:44.189
 we go so far without any problem 

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:51.189
 He proposed to talk about what they would like us to do 

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:54.830
 I will also answer as soon as I can 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.860
 also keep in mind that my wishes are good 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.180
 therefore market 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.400
 little more luck 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.130
 since I've seen tutorials that do not have their scope and it's a guy that just 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.039
 they write 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:09.039
 yes it is true sense to what is 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.310
 you are inside the destructive folder good I have nothing left to wish 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.029
 luck 

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:19.039
 and have fun subscribe with less from my office 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.240
 until the next step 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:36.310
 creative idea open in the third 9
