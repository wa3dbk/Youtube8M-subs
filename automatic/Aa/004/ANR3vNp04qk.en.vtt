00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
quite often in this camera is that it'll

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.900 
quite often in this camera is that it'll
take<00:00:21.539> certain<00:00:22.199> options<00:00:22.920> away<00:00:23.279> when<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:23.760> have

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
take certain options away when you have

certain modes selected so right now the

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.769 
certain modes selected so right now the
camera<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:27.869> in<00:00:27.900> Auto<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.730> if<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.880> change<00:00:30.240> the

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
camera is in Auto and if I change the

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.880 
camera is in Auto and if I change the
mode<00:00:31.160> you'll<00:00:32.160> see<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.759> options<00:00:33.210> change<00:00:33.890> it

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
mode you'll see the options change it

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.970 
mode you'll see the options change it
especially<00:00:35.730> changes<00:00:36.360> when<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:37.410> go<00:00:37.710> in

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
especially changes when you go in

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.720 
especially changes when you go in
between<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.670> manual<00:00:39.120> modes<00:00:39.390> right<00:00:40.020> here<00:00:40.469> and

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
between the manual modes right here and

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.040 
between the manual modes right here and
some<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.879> more<00:00:42.000> automatic<00:00:42.180> modes<00:00:42.780> such<00:00:42.989> as

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
some of the more automatic modes such as

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.220 
some of the more automatic modes such as
scene<00:00:43.500> or<00:00:43.800> effects<00:00:44.270> so<00:00:45.270> here<00:00:45.870> we<00:00:45.989> are<00:00:46.020> in

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
scene or effects so here we are in

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.930 
scene or effects so here we are in
effects<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.860> you'll<00:00:46.950> notice<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.340> HDR<00:00:47.879> is

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
effects and you'll notice that HDR is

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.180 
effects and you'll notice that HDR is
not<00:00:48.090> available<00:00:48.570> but<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.559> manual<00:00:49.950> modes

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
not available but in the manual modes

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.970 
not available but in the manual modes
you'll<00:00:50.850> see<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.149> HDR<00:00:51.539> is<00:00:51.840> available<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:52.710> make

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
you'll see that HDR is available so make

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.619 
you'll see that HDR is available so make
sure<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.640> check<00:00:53.820> that<00:00:53.879> that's<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.420> first

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
sure you check that that's the first

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.350 
sure you check that that's the first
thing<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.899> check<00:00:54.960> say<00:00:55.770> okay<00:00:56.219> what<00:00:56.670> mode<00:00:57.120> am<00:00:57.149> I

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
thing you check say okay what mode am I

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.560 
thing you check say okay what mode am I
in<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:58.079> now<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.739> we're<00:00:59.010> on<00:00:59.100> program<00:01:00.000> mode<00:01:00.300> I

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
in so now that we're on program mode I

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.770 
in so now that we're on program mode I
can<00:01:01.440> go<00:01:01.500> into<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.739> shooting<00:01:02.010> menu<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.600> set<00:01:03.600> my

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
can go into the shooting menu and set my

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.510 
can go into the shooting menu and set my
HDR<00:01:04.260> settings<00:01:05.479> so<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.840> here<00:01:07.439> we<00:01:07.619> have<00:01:07.740> HDR<00:01:08.189> mode

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
HDR settings so in here we have HDR mode

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.570 
HDR settings so in here we have HDR mode
which<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.540> on<00:01:09.810> for<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.229> single<00:01:10.619> photo<00:01:10.830> or<00:01:11.100> on<00:01:11.280> for

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
which is on for a single photo or on for

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.580 
which is on for a single photo or on for
a<00:01:11.640> series<00:01:12.150> which<00:01:12.360> means<00:01:12.600> it'll<00:01:12.840> stay<00:01:13.049> on<00:01:13.260> and

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
a series which means it'll stay on and

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.140 
a series which means it'll stay on and
you<00:01:13.740> don't<00:01:13.920> have<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.159> keep<00:01:14.280> going<00:01:14.340> back<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:15.000> to

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
you don't have to keep going back in to

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.289 
you don't have to keep going back in to
set<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.710> and<00:01:16.710> we<00:01:16.890> also<00:01:17.040> have<00:01:17.189> HDR<00:01:17.820> strength

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
set it and we also have HDR strength

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.230 
set it and we also have HDR strength
which<00:01:18.780> basically<00:01:19.200> tells<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:20.030> camera<00:01:21.030> how

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
which basically tells the camera how

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.390 
which basically tells the camera how
much<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.840> blend<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.710> light<00:01:22.890> in<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.189> dark

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
much to blend the light in the dark

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.420 
much to blend the light in the dark
areas<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.090> photo<00:01:24.360> or<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:25.170> have<00:01:25.380> Auto<00:01:25.890> as

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
areas of the photo or you have Auto as

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.780 
areas of the photo or you have Auto as
an<00:01:26.549> option<00:01:27.650> one<00:01:28.650> other<00:01:28.890> thing<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.310> note<00:01:29.340> that

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
an option one other thing to note that

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.289 
an option one other thing to note that
when<00:01:30.659> you're<00:01:31.439> shooting<00:01:31.979> in<00:01:32.189> other<00:01:32.460> modes<00:01:32.820> such

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
when you're shooting in other modes such

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.340 
when you're shooting in other modes such
as<00:01:33.619> bracketing<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:35.280> won't<00:01:35.610> let<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.180> set<00:01:36.720> HDR

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
as bracketing it won't let you set HDR

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.980 
as bracketing it won't let you set HDR
mode<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.829> now<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.670> have<00:01:38.909> HDR<00:01:39.420> mode<00:01:39.630> set

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
mode and now that I have HDR mode set

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.380 
mode and now that I have HDR mode set
I'm<00:01:40.229> it's<00:01:40.829> not<00:01:40.979> letting<00:01:41.430> me<00:01:41.549> change<00:01:41.820> into

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
I'm it's not letting me change into

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.649 
I'm it's not letting me change into
bracketing<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.649> if<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.520> go<00:01:44.670> into<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.210> if<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.540> go

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
bracketing so if I go into so if I go

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.410 
bracketing so if I go into so if I go
into<00:01:45.780> menu<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.380> take<00:01:47.040> HDR<00:01:47.610> mode<00:01:47.850> off<00:01:50.060> and<00:01:51.060> then

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
into menu and take HDR mode off and then

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.410 
into menu and take HDR mode off and then
go<00:01:51.570> back<00:01:51.799> now<00:01:52.799> I'm<00:01:53.040> able<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.340> actually<00:01:53.579> set<00:01:54.090> my

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
go back now I'm able to actually set my

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.219 
go back now I'm able to actually set my
bracketing<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:56.270> HDR<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.509> one<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.840> those<00:01:57.960> modes

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
bracketing so HDR is one of those modes

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.749 
bracketing so HDR is one of those modes
that<00:01:58.500> interferes<00:01:59.009> with<00:01:59.219> quite<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> few<00:01:59.549> other

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
that interferes with quite a few other

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.999 
that interferes with quite a few other
modes<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:00.689> just<00:02:01.020> make<00:02:01.200> sure<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.649> have<00:02:01.829> all

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
modes so just make sure you have all

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.160
