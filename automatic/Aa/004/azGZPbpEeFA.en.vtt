of the oven you can see it's just golden
on<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.340> edges<00:01:55.700> I'm<00:01:56.240> just<00:01:56.390> going<00:01:56.600> to<00:01:56.660> let<00:01:56.810> it

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
on the edges I'm just going to let it

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.420 
on the edges I'm just going to let it
sit<00:01:56.960> there<00:01:57.140> while<00:01:57.470> we<00:01:57.620> mix<00:01:57.830> up<00:01:57.980> the<00:01:58.100> filling

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
sit there while we mix up the filling

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.700 
sit there while we mix up the filling
which<00:01:58.610> is<00:01:58.760> really<00:01:59.060> really<00:01:59.270> simple<00:01:59.630> so<00:02:00.380> in<00:02:00.590> this

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
which is really really simple so in this

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.250 
which is really really simple so in this
bowl<00:02:00.950> I've<00:02:01.130> got<00:02:01.310> 4a<00:02:01.720> and<00:02:02.720> I'm<00:02:02.810> just<00:02:02.960> going<00:02:03.110> to

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
bowl I've got 4a and I'm just going to

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.590 
bowl I've got 4a and I'm just going to
whisk<00:02:03.560> in<00:02:03.830> 2<00:02:04.130> cups<00:02:04.340> of<00:02:04.490> sugar<00:02:06.580> and<00:02:07.580> a<00:02:08.270> third<00:02:08.479> of

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
whisk in 2 cups of sugar and a third of

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.960 
whisk in 2 cups of sugar and a third of
a<00:02:08.690> cup<00:02:08.869> of<00:02:08.930> lemon<00:02:09.890> juice<00:02:10.070> and<00:02:10.280> I've<00:02:10.399> used<00:02:10.640> fresh

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
a cup of lemon juice and I've used fresh

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.400 
a cup of lemon juice and I've used fresh
lemon<00:02:11.390> juice<00:02:11.420> because<00:02:11.750> it<00:02:11.930> really<00:02:12.080> makes<00:02:12.320> a

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
lemon juice because it really makes a

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.780 
lemon juice because it really makes a
difference<00:02:14.110> and<00:02:15.110> I<00:02:15.710> just<00:02:15.950> graded<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:16.580> rind

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
difference and I just graded the rind

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.640 
difference and I just graded the rind
off<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.210> lemon<00:02:17.540> it's<00:02:18.170> not<00:02:18.260> really<00:02:18.380> in<00:02:18.590> the

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650

off the lemon it's not really in the
recipe<00:02:18.950> that<00:02:19.280> figures<00:02:19.910> can<00:02:20.090> only<00:02:20.270> add<00:02:20.510> more

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.670 
recipe and you can get them quite small
so<00:02:43.670> because<00:02:44.480> you're<00:02:44.600> making<00:02:44.870> a<00:02:44.930> nine<00:02:45.110> by<00:02:45.290> 13
