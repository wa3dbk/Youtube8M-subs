cowl and no one knows that's just

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.340 
cowl and no one knows that's just
impossible

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
impossible

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.960 
impossible
so<00:02:11.510> let's<00:02:12.510> not<00:02:12.780> suspend<00:02:13.290> belief<00:02:13.770> so<00:02:14.370> much<00:02:14.550> why

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
so let's not suspend belief so much why

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.870 
so let's not suspend belief so much why
don't<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.209> let<00:02:15.330> me<00:02:15.420> do<00:02:15.540> two<00:02:15.570> voices<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.880> let

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
don't you let me do two voices and let

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.430 
don't you let me do two voices and let
me<00:02:17.970> use<00:02:18.120> my<00:02:18.300> own<00:02:18.480> voice<00:02:18.780> for<00:02:19.760> Bruce<00:02:20.760> Wayne<00:02:20.880> and

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
me use my own voice for Bruce Wayne and

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.780 
me use my own voice for Bruce Wayne and
then<00:02:22.440> I'll<00:02:22.560> use<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.920> voices<00:02:23.280> that<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.489> used<00:02:23.640> in

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
then I'll use the voices that I used in

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.850 
then I'll use the voices that I used in
the<00:02:23.850> audition<00:02:24.000> for<00:02:24.600> that<00:02:24.630> have<00:02:25.350> water<00:02:25.650> why

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
the audition for that have water why

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.949 
the audition for that have water why
don't<00:02:25.920> we<00:02:26.040> try<00:02:26.250> that<00:02:26.450> so<00:02:27.450> they<00:02:27.570> thought<00:02:27.720> well

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
don't we try that so they thought well

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.240 
don't we try that so they thought well
that's<00:02:28.170> kind<00:02:28.590> of<00:02:28.620> interesting

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
that's kind of interesting

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.940 
that's kind of interesting
so<00:02:29.549> that's<00:02:30.060> where<00:02:30.269> the<00:02:30.360> two<00:02:30.540> voice<00:02:30.780> idea<00:02:31.709> came

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
so that's where the two voice idea came

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.240 
so that's where the two voice idea came
um<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:33.209> it<00:02:33.330> made<00:02:33.480> a<00:02:33.510> lot<00:02:33.720> of<00:02:33.780> sense<00:02:34.049> and<00:02:34.410> then

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
um and it made a lot of sense and then

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.030 
um and it made a lot of sense and then
we<00:02:35.280> did<00:02:35.670> like<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:35.910> first<00:02:36.269> six<00:02:37.140> episodes<00:02:37.350> and

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
we did like the first six episodes and

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.759 
we did like the first six episodes and
then<00:02:38.310> they<00:02:38.750> you<00:02:39.750> know<00:02:39.870> they're<00:02:40.080> things

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
then they you know they're things

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.830 
then they you know they're things
evolved<00:02:41.190> organically<00:02:41.610> any<00:02:42.209> kind<00:02:42.450> of<00:02:42.540> artistic

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
evolved organically any kind of artistic

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.740 
evolved organically any kind of artistic
endeavor<00:02:43.200> involves<00:02:44.010> it<00:02:44.400> evolves<00:02:45.120> organically

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
endeavor involves it evolves organically

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.180 
endeavor involves it evolves organically
so<00:02:47.060> in<00:02:48.060> animation<00:02:48.840> you<00:02:49.049> record<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.950> show

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
so in animation you record the show

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.080 
so in animation you record the show
first<00:02:50.670> like<00:02:51.510> a<00:02:52.130> like<00:02:53.130> a<00:02:53.160> radio<00:02:53.549> play<00:02:53.850> you're

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
first like a like a radio play you're

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
first like a like a radio play you're
all<00:02:54.239> in<00:02:54.329> the<00:02:54.390> room<00:02:54.510> together<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:55.019> you're

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
all in the room together and you're

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.170 
all in the room together and you're
recording<00:02:55.320> that<00:02:55.620> from<00:02:55.769> a<00:02:55.799> script<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:56.430> then

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
recording that from a script and then

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.910 
recording that from a script and then
they<00:02:57.269> take<00:02:57.450> those<00:02:57.660> recordings<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:58.530> they<00:02:58.680> send

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
they take those recordings and they send

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.880 
they take those recordings and they send
them<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.220> artists<00:02:59.640> and<00:03:00.140> then<00:03:01.140> they<00:03:01.530> paint

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
them to the artists and then they paint

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.979 
them to the artists and then they paint
to<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.489> recording<00:03:03.090> so<00:03:03.299> we<00:03:03.450> have<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.720> first

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
to the recording so we have the first

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:09.630 
to the recording so we have the first
input<00:03:04.290> real<00:03:06.290> then<00:03:07.290> the

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
input real then the

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.820 
input real then the
visuals<00:03:10.640> come<00:03:10.910> back<00:03:11.150> and<00:03:11.480> a<00:03:12.290> process<00:03:12.680> called

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
visuals come back and a process called

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.790 
visuals come back and a process called
ADR<00:03:13.460> is<00:03:13.790> syncing<00:03:14.540> up<00:03:14.690> the<00:03:15.020> visuals<00:03:15.440> to<00:03:15.680> the

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
ADR is syncing up the visuals to the

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.350 
ADR is syncing up the visuals to the
soundtrack<00:03:16.310> that's<00:03:16.550> been<00:03:16.700> recorded<00:03:17.150> and

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
soundtrack that's been recorded and

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.890 
soundtrack that's been recorded and
there's<00:03:17.750> always<00:03:18.730> extra<00:03:19.730> mouth<00:03:20.240> flaps<00:03:20.600> that

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
there's always extra mouth flaps that

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.680 
there's always extra mouth flaps that
they<00:03:21.050> painted<00:03:21.290> in<00:03:21.910> or<00:03:22.910> not<00:03:23.090> enough<00:03:23.390> mouth

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
they painted in or not enough mouth

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.080 
they painted in or not enough mouth
locks<00:03:24.020> and<00:03:24.320> so<00:03:25.040> then<00:03:25.250> you've<00:03:25.460> got<00:03:25.670> a<00:03:25.700> sort<00:03:26.030> of

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
locks and so then you've got a sort of

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.480 
locks and so then you've got a sort of
doctor<00:03:26.810> to<00:03:26.960> script<00:03:27.260> a<00:03:27.380> little<00:03:27.500> bit<00:03:27.740> to<00:03:28.190> fit

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 
doctor to script a little bit to fit

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.040 
doctor to script a little bit to fit
what<00:03:28.730> the<00:03:28.880> artists<00:03:29.270> have<00:03:29.360> actually<00:03:29.840> created

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
what the artists have actually created

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.100 
what the artists have actually created
and<00:03:30.470> then<00:03:31.310> it<00:03:31.430> gets<00:03:31.610> on<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:31.820> air<00:03:32.090> so<00:03:32.870> there's<00:03:33.050> a

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
and then it gets on the air so there's a

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.530 
and then it gets on the air so there's a
six-month<00:03:33.620> period<00:03:33.920> between<00:03:34.540> recording

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
six-month period between recording

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.420 
six-month period between recording
before<00:03:36.230> you<00:03:36.350> ever<00:03:36.470> see<00:03:36.830> anything<00:03:37.130> and<00:03:37.370> then

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
before you ever see anything and then

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.160 
before you ever see anything and then
there's<00:03:38.120> another<00:03:38.240> few<00:03:38.600> months<00:03:38.720> before<00:03:39.110> it

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
there's another few months before it

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.960 
there's another few months before it
actually<00:03:39.260> gets<00:03:39.560> on<00:03:39.770> there<00:03:40.010> so<00:03:40.580> during<00:03:40.910> that

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
actually gets on there so during that

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.760 
actually gets on there so during that
six<00:03:41.270> months<00:03:41.510> we<00:03:41.600> were<00:03:41.660> recording<00:03:41.990> shows<00:03:42.350> and

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
six months we were recording shows and

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.670 
six months we were recording shows and
then<00:03:43.670> they<00:03:44.480> started<00:03:44.900> seeing<00:03:45.260> the<00:03:45.380> artwork

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
then they started seeing the artwork

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.260 
then they started seeing the artwork
coming<00:03:45.950> back<00:03:46.070> and<00:03:46.220> it<00:03:46.310> was<00:03:46.400> much<00:03:46.850> darker

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 
coming back and it was much darker

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:48.490 
coming back and it was much darker
because<00:03:47.660> you<00:03:47.780> know<00:03:47.870> as<00:03:47.930> you<00:03:47.990> know<00:03:48.170> this<00:03:48.290> shows

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
because you know as you know this shows

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.620 
because you know as you know this shows
painted<00:03:48.950> on<00:03:49.010> a<00:03:49.070> black<00:03:49.310> background<00:03:49.640> which<00:03:50.510> was

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
painted on a black background which was

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.080 
painted on a black background which was
the<00:03:50.750> first<00:03:50.900> time<00:03:51.140> that<00:03:51.350> was<00:03:51.500> done<00:03:51.640> so<00:03:52.640> it<00:03:52.850> was

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
the first time that was done so it was

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.530 
the first time that was done so it was
very<00:03:53.960> noir<00:03:54.620> it<00:03:54.950> was<00:03:55.070> a<00:03:55.100> very<00:03:55.430> film<00:03:55.910> noir<00:03:56.240> feel

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
very noir it was a very film noir feel

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
Korea so they doubled the budget on this

Korea so they doubled the budget on this
show<00:04:07.430> that<00:04:07.610> they<00:04:07.700> usually<00:04:07.850> spent<00:04:08.330> on<00:04:08.510> a

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
show that they usually spent on a

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.060 
show that they usually spent on a
half-hour<00:04:08.900> show<00:04:09.170> and<00:04:09.470> look<00:04:09.560> and<00:04:09.830> it<00:04:09.920> look

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
that's why the show looked so rich is

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.970 
that's why the show looked so rich is
because<00:04:12.620> they<00:04:12.980> invested<00:04:13.310> in<00:04:14.060> it<00:04:14.680> it's<00:04:15.680> why

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
because they invested in it it's why

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
we're all here 22 years later is because

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.410

of sarcasm he had a real sarcastic Asian
which<00:04:52.190> i<00:04:52.280> thought<00:04:52.460> was<00:04:52.580> great<00:04:52.760> to<00:04:53.020> contrast<00:04:54.020> to

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
which i thought was great to contrast to

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.430 
which i thought was great to contrast to
the<00:04:54.350> Batman<00:04:54.710> character<00:04:55.540> and<00:04:56.540> it<00:04:56.660> was<00:04:56.690> but<00:04:57.290> it

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
the Batman character and it was but it

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.300 
the Batman character and it was but it
didn't<00:04:57.710> work<00:04:57.860> in<00:04:58.070> this<00:04:58.450> more<00:04:59.450> dark<00:05:00.230> world<00:05:01.070> of

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
didn't work in this more dark world of

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.370 
didn't work in this more dark world of
it<00:05:01.460> so<00:05:02.330> I<00:05:02.360> actually<00:05:02.570> had<00:05:02.810> to<00:05:02.840> go<00:05:02.990> back<00:05:03.110> and

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
it so I actually had to go back and

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.030 
it so I actually had to go back and
rerecord<00:05:03.919> the<00:05:04.430> first

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
rerecord the first

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.900 
rerecord the first
six<00:05:05.550> episodes<00:05:06.210> just<00:05:07.130> the<00:05:08.130> Bruce<00:05:08.340> Wayne<00:05:08.580> voice

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
six episodes just the Bruce Wayne voice

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.180 
six episodes just the Bruce Wayne voice
just<00:05:09.540> to<00:05:09.660> tone<00:05:09.870> him<00:05:10.110> down<00:05:10.320> to<00:05:10.590> make<00:05:10.740> him<00:05:10.890> closer

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
just to tone him down to make him closer

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.800 
just to tone him down to make him closer
to<00:05:11.370> the<00:05:11.580> Batman<00:05:11.940> voice<00:05:12.180> because<00:05:12.510> they<00:05:12.630> like

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
to the Batman voice because they like

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.140 
to the Batman voice because they like
the<00:05:12.960> distinction<00:05:13.350> ideal<00:05:13.860> but<00:05:14.610> it<00:05:14.700> just<00:05:14.910> had<00:05:15.060> to

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
the distinction ideal but it just had to

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.750 
the distinction ideal but it just had to
be<00:05:15.270> very<00:05:15.480> subtle
