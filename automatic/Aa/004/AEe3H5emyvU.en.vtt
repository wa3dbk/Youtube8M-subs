00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
your guy because you know this is

your guy because you know this is
science<00:00:54.290> and<00:00:54.560> and<00:00:54.800> and<00:00:55.310> we<00:00:55.460> have<00:00:55.640> our<00:00:55.790> we<00:00:56.240> have

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
science and and and we have our we have

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.760 
science and and and we have our we have
our<00:00:56.420> control<00:00:56.750> group<00:00:56.870> under<00:00:57.290> experimental

group<00:00:58.070> and<00:00:58.250> all<00:00:58.340> that<00:00:58.490> yeah<00:00:58.850> that'd<00:00:59.180> be<00:00:59.210> pretty

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
group and all that yeah that'd be pretty

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.500 
group and all that yeah that'd be pretty
heartless<00:00:59.930> but<00:01:00.560> in<00:01:00.710> 2006<00:01:01.550> the<00:01:01.940> answer<00:01:02.240> to<00:01:02.390> this

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
heartless but in 2006 the answer to this

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.780 
heartless but in 2006 the answer to this
question<00:01:02.750> that<00:01:03.320> we<00:01:03.470> scientifically<00:01:04.250> ring

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
question that we scientifically ring

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.640 
question that we scientifically ring
pretty<00:01:05.030> clearly<00:01:05.510> when<00:01:05.990> the<00:01:06.020> Templeton

study these were real heart patients in

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:19.990 
study these were real heart patients in
in<00:01:18.409> hospitals<00:01:18.980> that<00:01:19.159> were<00:01:19.280> recovering<00:01:19.730> so

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
in hospitals that were recovering so

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.190 
in hospitals that were recovering so
they<00:01:20.120> could<00:01:20.270> measure<00:01:20.480> everything<00:01:20.930> and

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
they could measure everything and

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.930 
they could measure everything and
control<00:01:21.320> for<00:01:21.770> all<00:01:21.890> these<00:01:22.040> other<00:01:22.100> intervening

prayer has consequences
independent<00:02:03.049> of<00:02:03.260> the<00:02:03.500> person

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
independent of the person

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.349 
independent of the person
spring<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:05.350> that's<00:02:05.590> a<00:02:06.060> complicated<00:02:07.060> question

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:07.359 
spring and that's a complicated question

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:10.139 
spring and that's a complicated question
about<00:02:08.080> divine<00:02:08.470> intervention<00:02:09.220> people<00:02:09.819> have<00:02:10.119> a

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
about divine intervention people have a

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.300 
about divine intervention people have a
lot<00:02:10.390> of<00:02:10.420> different<00:02:10.840> things<00:02:11.019> at<00:02:11.950> first<00:02:12.160> the

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
lot of different things at first the

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.670 
lot of different things at first the
research<00:02:12.640> that<00:02:12.790> people<00:02:13.090> get<00:02:13.180> all<00:02:13.620> stirred<00:02:14.620> up

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
research that people get all stirred up

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.550 
research that people get all stirred up
hot<00:02:14.920> hot<00:02:15.790> and<00:02:15.940> bothered<00:02:16.060> about<00:02:16.299> I<00:02:16.750> think<00:02:17.319> the

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
hot hot and bothered about I think the

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.650 
hot hot and bothered about I think the
research<00:02:17.950> we<00:02:18.160> really<00:02:18.459> need<00:02:18.640> to<00:02:18.760> do<00:02:18.940> more<00:02:19.239> of<00:02:19.269> is

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
research we really need to do more of is

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.199 
research we really need to do more of is
to<00:02:19.870> understand<00:02:20.349> how<00:02:20.620> prayer<00:02:21.220> changes<00:02:21.879> the

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
to understand how prayer changes the

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.320 
to understand how prayer changes the
person<00:02:22.660> who<00:02:22.810> prays<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:23.940> again<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:25.090> think

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
person who prays and again I think

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.229 
person who prays and again I think
there's<00:02:25.629> more<00:02:26.110> and<00:02:26.500> more<00:02:26.709> evidence<00:02:27.190> that<00:02:27.340> this

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
there's more and more evidence that this

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:35.520 
there's more and more evidence that this
practice<00:02:29.819> talking<00:02:30.819> to<00:02:31.980> God<00:02:32.980> or<00:02:33.940> at<00:02:34.209> least<00:02:34.530> the

person that you represent in the mind is

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.600 
person that you represent in the mind is

being at wise good loving person is has

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.030 
being at wise good loving person is has

has health effects both emotionally and

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.660 
has health effects both emotionally and
physically<00:02:46.319> okay<00:02:47.319> so<00:02:47.920> it<00:02:48.040> seems<00:02:48.280> there<00:02:48.459> may<00:02:48.640> be

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
physically okay so it seems there may be

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.059 
physically okay so it seems there may be
health<00:02:49.030> benefits<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:49.720> prayer<00:02:49.989> after<00:02:50.200> all<00:02:50.530> so

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
health benefits to prayer after all so

they're using the human mind human mind
is<00:03:43.260> human<00:03:44.260> and<00:03:44.470> so<00:03:45.450> when<00:03:46.450> I<00:03:46.480> saw<00:03:46.780> is<00:03:46.900> that

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
is human and so when I saw is that

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.710 
is human and so when I saw is that
people<00:03:47.349> were<00:03:47.609> training<00:03:48.609> their<00:03:48.880> imagination

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
people were training their imagination

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.900 
people were training their imagination
what<00:03:50.290> they're<00:03:50.440> really<00:03:50.650> doing<00:03:50.859> is<00:03:51.430> learning<00:03:51.639> to

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
what they're really doing is learning to

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.559 
what they're really doing is learning to
take<00:03:52.180> seriously<00:03:52.959> get<00:03:53.950> thoughts<00:03:54.430> anima<00:03:55.329> and

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
take seriously get thoughts anima and

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.670 
take seriously get thoughts anima and
the<00:03:55.870> and<00:03:56.109> images<00:03:56.680> that<00:03:56.950> they<00:03:57.459> might<00:03:57.700> otherwise

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
the and images that they might otherwise

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.199 
the and images that they might otherwise
dismiss<00:03:59.680> is<00:03:59.859> just<00:04:00.099> there's<00:04:00.340> so<00:04:01.000> they're

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
dismiss is just there's so they're

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:02.849 
dismiss is just there's so they're
paying<00:04:01.599> attention<00:04:01.870> to<00:04:02.560> their<00:04:02.680> inner

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
that inner experience becomes for them

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.719 
that inner experience becomes for them
it<00:04:10.989> allows<00:04:11.139> them<00:04:11.739> to<00:04:11.919> take<00:04:12.190> the<00:04:12.400> prayer

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:12.729 
it allows them to take the prayer

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:15.180 
it allows them to take the prayer
process<00:04:13.630> more<00:04:13.870> seriously<00:04:14.410> and

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
process more seriously and

researchers can't go there and instead

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.710 
researchers can't go there and instead
only<00:04:50.680> look<00:04:51.010> at<00:04:51.100> the<00:04:51.220> very<00:04:51.400> human<00:04:51.700> very<00:04:52.060> secular

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
with a deity something that scientists

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.680 
with a deity something that scientists
can't<00:05:00.430> touch<00:05:00.640> with<00:05:00.820> a<00:05:00.850> ten-foot<00:05:01.390> pole

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
meditative thought or you know just

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.600 
meditative thought or you know just
anything<00:05:10.990> is<00:05:11.200> the<00:05:11.470> problem<00:05:11.830> prayers<00:05:12.070> is<00:05:12.340> just

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
anything is the problem prayers is just

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.360 
anything is the problem prayers is just
so<00:05:12.790> wrapped<00:05:13.150> up<00:05:13.360> with<00:05:13.420> all<00:05:13.690> the<00:05:13.810> religious
