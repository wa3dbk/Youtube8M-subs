00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
so the one thing that I don't personally

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.570 
so the one thing that I don't personally
like<00:02:43.500> about<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:44.069> beretta<00:02:44.310> is<00:02:44.580> that<00:02:45.150> the

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
like about the beretta is that the

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.130 
like about the beretta is that the
safety<00:02:47.580> is<00:02:47.819> in<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.030> wrong<00:02:48.209> direction<00:02:48.420> in<00:02:48.930> my

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
safety is in the wrong direction in my

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.110 
safety is in the wrong direction in my
opinion<00:02:49.530> it's<00:02:49.709> swooping<00:02:50.190> up<00:02:50.310> it's<00:02:50.549> definitely

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
opinion it's swooping up it's definitely

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.559 
opinion it's swooping up it's definitely
