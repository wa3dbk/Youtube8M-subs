we'll go speakers with a bad amplifier
oh<00:00:49.240> maybe<00:00:49.660> now's<00:00:49.930> the<00:00:49.960> right<00:00:50.080> wire<00:00:50.680> you<00:00:51.100> know

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
oh maybe now's the right wire you know

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:06.450 
you turn the games down you know this
torture<00:01:05.229> rates<00:01:05.470> going<00:01:05.650> to<00:01:05.740> roll<00:01:05.860> down<00:01:06.009> you

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
torture rates going to roll down you

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.210

know<00:01:06.640> so<00:01:07.299> as<00:01:08.049> far<00:01:08.290> as<00:01:08.350> building<00:01:08.590> a<00:01:08.770> note<00:01:08.950> you

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
know so as far as building a note you

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.899 
know so as far as building a note you
know<00:01:09.340> like<00:01:09.490> the<00:01:09.990> foundation<00:01:10.990> for<00:01:11.710> me<00:01:12.130> it's<00:01:12.640> the

motorization but one of the motors broke

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:24.719 
motorization but one of the motors broke
down<00:01:22.810> you<00:01:23.079> can<00:01:23.229> get<00:01:23.469> to<00:01:23.590> so<00:01:24.219> now<00:01:24.399> as<00:01:24.579> I've

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
down you can get to so now as I've

thing at once you can punish the

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.900 
thing at once you can punish the
amplifier<00:01:52.720> then<00:01:53.290> he<00:01:53.500> came<00:01:53.680> by<00:01:53.860> and<00:01:54.190> a<00:01:54.460> donkey's

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
amplifier then he came by and a donkey's

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.120 
amplifier then he came by and a donkey's
I<00:01:54.970> can<00:01:55.300> go<00:01:55.420> into<00:01:55.780> that<00:01:56.140> into<00:01:56.800> the<00:01:56.920> amplifier

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
I can go into that into the amplifier

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.890 
I can go into that into the amplifier
make<00:01:57.700> you<00:01:57.820> look<00:01:57.910> cool<00:01:57.970> cool<00:01:58.330> which

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
was going to do when i was working at

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.560 
was going to do when i was working at
metra<00:02:02.890> and<00:02:03.130> it<00:02:03.460> never<00:02:03.610> happened<00:02:04.060> you<00:02:04.210> know<00:02:04.330> I

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
metra and it never happened you know I

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.540 
metra and it never happened you know I
think<00:02:05.020> man<00:02:05.440> affects<00:02:05.800> the<00:02:05.920> biggest<00:02:06.220> mistake

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
think man affects the biggest mistake

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.850 
think man affects the biggest mistake
that<00:02:06.580> tried<00:02:07.000> to<00:02:07.030> do<00:02:07.300> try<00:02:07.930> to<00:02:07.960> be<00:02:08.259> like<00:02:08.380> so<00:02:08.649> a

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
that tried to do try to be like so a

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.640 
that tried to do try to be like so a
noble<00:02:09.429> thing<00:02:09.460> instead<00:02:10.450> of<00:02:10.600> creating<00:02:10.899> hype<00:02:11.470> in

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
noble thing instead of creating hype in

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.980 
noble thing instead of creating hype in
the<00:02:11.770> industry<00:02:12.220> and<00:02:12.700> I<00:02:12.880> talked<00:02:13.209> to<00:02:13.330> I<00:02:13.420> asked<00:02:13.750> out

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
the industry and I talked to I asked out

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.980 
the industry and I talked to I asked out
15<00:02:14.590> years<00:02:14.860> ago<00:02:15.010> where<00:02:15.810> motorization<00:02:16.810> should

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
15 years ago where motorization should

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.199 
15 years ago where motorization should
be<00:02:17.140> a<00:02:17.170> real<00:02:17.530> big<00:02:17.740> part<00:02:18.040> of<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.790> same<00:02:19.000> because

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
be a real big part of the same because

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.690 
be a real big part of the same because
imagine<00:02:19.540> having<00:02:19.870> 50<00:02:20.350> on<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.680> cards<00:02:21.070> and<00:02:21.370> each

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
imagine having 50 on the cards and each

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.949 
imagine having 50 on the cards and each
one<00:02:21.970> of<00:02:22.000> those<00:02:22.209> got<00:02:22.480> all<00:02:22.600> this<00:02:22.690> great<00:02:22.750> stuff

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
one of those got all this great stuff

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.260 
one of those got all this great stuff
moving<00:02:23.530> and<00:02:24.190> I<00:02:24.280> really<00:02:24.520> feel<00:02:24.760> that<00:02:24.790> one<00:02:25.090> of
