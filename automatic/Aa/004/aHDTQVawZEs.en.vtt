we<00:01:31.590> would<00:01:31.709> have<00:01:31.799> done<00:01:31.979> but<00:01:32.310> when<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.549> was<00:01:32.789> there

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
we would have done but when I was there

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.580

it's<00:01:59.340> quite<00:01:59.579> leave<00:02:00.270> me<00:02:00.390> alone<00:02:00.659> get<00:02:01.020> out<00:02:01.110> my<00:02:01.229> way

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
it's quite leave me alone get out my way

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.199 
it's quite leave me alone get out my way
then<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.009> think<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.310> things<00:02:02.459> like<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.849> bricks

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:03.209 
then I think the things like the bricks

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:05.510 
then I think the things like the bricks
at<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.360> top<00:02:03.569> here<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.469> too<00:02:04.859> much<00:02:05.099> it<00:02:05.489> is

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
at the top here is it too much it is

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.490 
at the top here is it too much it is
making<00:02:05.969> too<00:02:06.119> much<00:02:06.270> there<00:02:06.539> so<00:02:06.780> maybe<00:02:07.349> I'll

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
making too much there so maybe I'll

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.910 
making too much there so maybe I'll
bring<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.739> down<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.920> little<00:02:08.340> bit<00:02:08.549> here<00:02:09.769> crop<00:02:10.769> in

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
bring it down a little bit here crop in

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.740 
bring it down a little bit here crop in
it<00:02:11.039> let's<00:02:11.340> see<00:02:11.519> if<00:02:11.549> I<00:02:11.700> can<00:02:11.849> mean<00:02:11.970> it's<00:02:12.420> cropping

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
it let's see if I can mean it's cropping

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.449 
it let's see if I can mean it's cropping
at<00:02:12.840> all<00:02:14.510> see<00:02:15.510> it's<00:02:15.690> quite<00:02:16.010> happen<00:02:17.010> as<00:02:17.130> well<00:02:17.340> may

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
at all see it's quite happen as well may

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.990 
at all see it's quite happen as well may
have<00:02:17.489> just<00:02:17.790> become<00:02:18.239> in<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.569> bit<00:02:19.700> she's<00:02:20.700> rushing

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
have just become in a bit she's rushing

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.270 
have just become in a bit she's rushing
by<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.420> bring<00:02:21.599> it<00:02:21.690> outside<00:02:21.950> so<00:02:22.950> will<00:02:23.069> crop<00:02:23.250> it

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
by to bring it outside so will crop it

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.629 
by to bring it outside so will crop it
there<00:02:24.950> straightening<00:02:25.950> don't<00:02:26.459> need

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:26.639 
there straightening don't need

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:28.280 
there straightening don't need
straighten<00:02:27.000> it<00:02:27.090> that<00:02:27.239> much<00:02:27.450> but<00:02:27.690> because

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
straighten it that much but because

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.479 
straighten it that much but because
we've<00:02:28.530> got<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.650> brick<00:02:28.859> wall<00:02:29.010> it's<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.250> great

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
we've got a brick wall it's a great

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.490 
we've got a brick wall it's a great
guide<00:02:29.730> line<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.209> see<00:02:30.480> how<00:02:30.989> straight<00:02:31.349> the

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
guide line to see how straight the

bad<00:02:38.690> and<00:02:39.690> we've<00:02:39.930> got<00:02:40.019> other<00:02:40.230> out<00:02:40.470> other<00:02:40.799> little

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
bad and we've got other out other little

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.710 
bad and we've got other out other little
bits<00:02:41.160> here<00:02:41.310> so<00:02:41.730> some<00:02:42.450> of<00:02:42.480> them<00:02:42.630> I<00:02:42.660> don't

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
bits here so some of them I don't

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.319 
bits here so some of them I don't
usually<00:02:43.079> do<00:02:43.319> like<00:02:43.349> selectively<00:02:44.190> adjust<00:02:45.120> so<00:02:45.299> I

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
usually do like selectively adjust so I

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:50.000 
usually do like selectively adjust so I
can<00:02:45.569> select<00:02:46.349> part<00:02:46.709> of<00:02:46.889> the<00:02:47.150> photo<00:02:48.980> say<00:02:49.980> I

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
can select part of the photo say I

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.879 
can select part of the photo say I
wanted<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.370> select<00:02:50.549> the<00:02:51.480> floor<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.709> I<00:02:52.769> can

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:52.889 
wanted to select the floor and I can

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:54.830 
wanted to select the floor and I can
just<00:02:53.069> spread<00:02:53.220> it<00:02:53.280> out<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:53.940> can<00:02:54.150> pretty<00:02:54.750> much

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
just spread it out and I can pretty much

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.319 
just spread it out and I can pretty much
just<00:02:54.959> do<00:02:55.319> the<00:02:55.440> floor<00:02:55.940> and<00:02:56.940> then<00:02:57.030> I<00:02:57.090> can<00:02:57.239> do

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
just do the floor and then I can do

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.150 
just do the floor and then I can do
things<00:02:57.510> like<00:02:57.690> brightness<00:02:58.349> again<00:02:58.799> really

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
things like brightness again really

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.140 
things like brightness again really
practice<00:02:59.519> down<00:02:59.639> on<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.790> floor

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
practice down on the floor

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.680 
practice down on the floor
raise<00:03:00.299> it<00:03:01.069> the<00:03:02.069> contrast<00:03:02.609> again<00:03:03.389> and

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
raise it the contrast again and

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.839 
raise it the contrast again and
saturation<00:03:04.349> if<00:03:04.590> I<00:03:04.650> make<00:03:04.799> the<00:03:04.859> floor<00:03:05.069> black<00:03:05.669> and

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
saturation if I make the floor black and

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:10.460 
saturation if I make the floor black and
white<00:03:05.940> or<00:03:06.120> wanted<00:03:06.329> to<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:08.150> quite<00:03:09.150> moody<00:03:09.480> quite

dark<00:03:10.769> but<00:03:11.099> I<00:03:11.669> don't<00:03:12.239> really<00:03:12.329> think<00:03:12.450> I<00:03:12.660> need<00:03:12.780> to

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
dark but I don't really think I need to

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.289 
dark but I don't really think I need to
anything<00:03:13.109> with<00:03:13.200> that<00:03:13.230> one<00:03:13.440> so<00:03:13.530> let's<00:03:13.680> go<00:03:13.829> back

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
makes it come out a little bit again so

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.580 
makes it come out a little bit again so
there<00:03:34.060> you<00:03:34.120> go<00:03:34.240> these<00:03:34.450> bricks<00:03:34.690> come<00:03:35.020> out<00:03:35.170> a<00:03:35.380> bit

there you go these bricks come out a bit

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.120 
there you go these bricks come out a bit
more<00:03:35.740> and<00:03:36.370> with<00:03:36.970> that<00:03:37.180> you<00:03:37.330> can<00:03:37.650> make<00:03:38.650> it<00:03:38.830> more

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
more and with that you can make it more

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.710 
more and with that you can make it more
colorful<00:03:39.400> and<00:03:39.790> more<00:03:39.880> saturation<00:03:40.360> in<00:03:40.600> it

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720

down<00:03:43.390> to<00:03:43.510> nothing

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:43.990 
down to nothing

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.870 
down to nothing
all<00:03:44.710> right<00:03:44.800> I<00:03:45.100> think<00:03:45.250> we've<00:03:45.490> had<00:03:45.640> a<00:03:45.700> bit

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
all right I think we've had a bit

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:53.390 
all right I think we've had a bit
withdrawn<00:03:46.090> into<00:03:46.540> this<00:03:46.660> quite<00:03:47.590> cool<00:03:48.480> about<00:03:50.850> 47%

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
withdrawn into this quite cool about 47%

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.130 
withdrawn into this quite cool about 47%
so<00:03:54.400> I<00:03:54.430> feel<00:03:54.640> like<00:03:54.670> in<00:03:54.970> that<00:03:55.000> app<00:03:55.330> it's<00:03:55.660> done

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
so I feel like in that app it's done

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.630 
so I feel like in that app it's done
I'll<00:03:56.430> save<00:03:57.430> it<00:03:57.570> to<00:03:58.570> my<00:03:58.600> photo<00:03:58.840> library<00:03:59.080> and

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
I'll save it to my photo library and

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.160 
I'll save it to my photo library and
then<00:04:00.640> open<00:04:00.910> it<00:04:00.940> up<00:04:01.090> and<00:04:01.360> another<00:04:01.780> one<00:04:02.020> to

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
then open it up and another one to

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.470 
then open it up and another one to
process<00:04:02.800> a<00:04:02.920> bit<00:04:03.040> further<00:04:03.310> so<00:04:04.030> this<00:04:04.150> one<00:04:04.330> here

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
process a bit further so this one here

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.170 
process a bit further so this one here
if<00:04:04.600> we<00:04:04.690> want<00:04:04.840> to<00:04:04.900> do<00:04:05.170> depth<00:04:05.560> of<00:04:05.709> field<00:04:06.060> so<00:04:07.060> we'll

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
if we want to do depth of field so we'll

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.030 
if we want to do depth of field so we'll
open<00:04:07.300> up<00:04:07.540> this<00:04:07.780> is<00:04:07.930> a<00:04:07.959> app<00:04:08.410> called<00:04:08.440> big<00:04:08.830> lens

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
open up this is a app called big lens

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.540 
open up this is a app called big lens
and<00:04:09.489> this<00:04:10.450> one<00:04:10.720> basically<00:04:11.200> so<00:04:11.770> go<00:04:12.040> to<00:04:12.100> advanced

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
and this one basically so go to advanced

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.820 
and this one basically so go to advanced
I'm<00:04:13.360> going<00:04:13.660> to<00:04:13.750> adjust<00:04:13.989> that<00:04:14.140> sort<00:04:14.470> of<00:04:14.500> so<00:04:14.800> I

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
I'm going to adjust that sort of so I

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.560 
I'm going to adjust that sort of so I
want<00:04:15.010> to<00:04:15.040> make<00:04:15.160> her<00:04:15.310> more<00:04:15.550> blood<00:04:15.790> and<00:04:16.120> have<00:04:16.419> him

want to make her more blood and have him

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.949 
want to make her more blood and have him
in<00:04:16.690> focus<00:04:17.109> zoom<00:04:17.400> in<00:04:18.400> got<00:04:19.180> the<00:04:19.269> brush<00:04:19.450> selected

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
in focus zoom in got the brush selected

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.080 
in focus zoom in got the brush selected
here<00:04:20.169> we'll<00:04:20.350> have<00:04:20.500> it<00:04:20.680> my<00:04:21.340> size<00:04:21.579> and<00:04:21.850> then<00:04:22.060> you

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
here we'll have it my size and then you

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.290 
here we'll have it my size and then you
basically<00:04:22.390> just<00:04:22.690> mask<00:04:23.169> her<00:04:24.000> then<00:04:25.000> once<00:04:25.180> you

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
basically just mask her then once you

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.020 
basically just mask her then once you
master<00:04:25.720> and<00:04:25.900> then<00:04:26.610> again<00:04:27.610> she's<00:04:27.820> basically

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
master and then again she's basically

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.210 
master and then again she's basically
giving<00:04:28.450> in<00:04:28.570> the<00:04:29.260> closer<00:04:29.740> doing<00:04:29.979> the<00:04:30.070> fine

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
giving in the closer doing the fine

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.980 
giving in the closer doing the fine
details<00:04:30.640> so<00:04:30.910> go<00:04:31.030> to<00:04:31.150> blur<00:04:31.330> bring<00:04:31.600> a<00:04:31.690> brush<00:04:31.840> size

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
details so go to blur bring a brush size

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.640 
details so go to blur bring a brush size
down<00:04:32.050> a<00:04:32.290> bit

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.290 

I<00:04:34.680> thought<00:04:35.250> the<00:04:35.430> case<00:04:35.580> of<00:04:35.759> just<00:04:36.060> then<00:04:36.180> you've

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
I thought the case of just then you've

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.879 
I thought the case of just then you've
got<00:04:36.389> an<00:04:36.479> HDR<00:04:36.810> setting<00:04:37.320> up<00:04:37.410> here<00:04:37.560> which<00:04:37.710> you<00:04:37.770> can

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
got an HDR setting up here which you can

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:39.650 
got an HDR setting up here which you can
turn<00:04:38.040> on<00:04:38.100> and<00:04:38.430> it<00:04:38.669> brings<00:04:38.850> it<00:04:39.030> out<00:04:39.150> a<00:04:39.180> bit<00:04:39.300> more

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
turn on and it brings it out a bit more

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.210 
turn on and it brings it out a bit more
you<00:04:40.110> go<00:04:40.199> back<00:04:40.380> to<00:04:40.530> it<00:04:40.590> again<00:04:40.650> you<00:04:40.889> can<00:04:41.009> see<00:04:41.130> the

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
you go back to it again you can see the

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.950 
you go back to it again you can see the
difference

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
difference

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.260 
difference
switch<00:04:42.960> on<00:04:43.199> I<00:04:43.699> like<00:04:44.699> that<00:04:44.820> now<00:04:44.940> I<00:04:44.970> mean<00:04:45.180> the

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
switch on I like that now I mean the

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.670 
switch on I like that now I mean the
bricks<00:04:45.479> were<00:04:45.600> lighted<00:04:45.990> before<00:04:46.229> and<00:04:46.320> I<00:04:46.350> said<00:04:46.500> no

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
bricks were lighted before and I said no

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.379 
bricks were lighted before and I said no
but<00:04:46.889> now<00:04:47.009> I<00:04:47.039> think<00:04:47.160> yeah<00:04:47.639> despite<00:04:48.060> the<00:04:48.210> safety

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
but now I think yeah despite the safety

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.230 
but now I think yeah despite the safety
camera<00:04:48.840> roll<00:04:49.310> it<00:04:50.310> looks<00:04:50.460> quite<00:04:50.669> nice<00:04:50.789> I<00:04:51.060> like

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240

the I like the look out on here as still

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.040 
the I like the look out on here as still
quite<00:04:56.669> normal<00:04:56.970> in<00:04:57.060> some<00:04:57.180> places<00:04:57.389> that<00:04:57.810> brings

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
quite normal in some places that brings

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.909 
quite normal in some places that brings
out<00:04:58.169> the<00:04:58.259> bricks<00:04:58.500> a<00:04:58.710> lot<00:04:58.979> more<00:05:00.710> blowing<00:05:01.710> out

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
out the bricks a lot more blowing out

out the bricks a lot more blowing out
the<00:05:01.979> one<00:05:02.130> makes<00:05:02.340> a<00:05:02.550> lot<00:05:03.000> more<00:05:03.030> busier<00:05:03.389> as<00:05:03.509> well
