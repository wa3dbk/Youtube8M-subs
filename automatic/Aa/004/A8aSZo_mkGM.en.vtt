the yellow turn counter will highlight

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.990 
the yellow turn counter will highlight
me<00:04:47.620> and<00:04:48.620> it'll<00:04:48.800> say<00:04:49.010> turn<00:04:49.250> underneath<00:04:49.550> so<00:04:49.970> you

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
me and it'll say turn underneath so you

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.160 
me and it'll say turn underneath so you
know<00:04:50.180> that<00:04:50.360> it's<00:04:50.510> your<00:04:50.690> turn<00:04:52.480> now<00:04:53.480> my<00:04:53.690> turn<00:04:53.750> and

know that it's your turn now my turn and

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.460 
know that it's your turn now my turn and
I<00:04:54.260> get<00:04:54.500> to<00:04:54.620> build<00:04:54.830> again<00:04:56.110> again<00:04:57.110> it<00:04:57.350> is

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
I get to build again again it is

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:58.960 
I get to build again again it is
important<00:04:57.950> to<00:04:57.980> match<00:04:58.220> your<00:04:58.460> color<00:04:58.670> tabs

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
important to match your color tabs

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.700 
important to match your color tabs
because<00:04:59.330> if<00:04:59.720> your<00:04:59.840> color<00:05:00.050> tabs<00:05:00.350> are<00:05:00.530> matched

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
because if your color tabs are matched

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.540 
because if your color tabs are matched
up<00:05:01.330> you<00:05:02.330> can<00:05:02.930> keep<00:05:03.170> moving<00:05:03.650> throughout<00:05:04.100> any

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
up you can keep moving throughout any

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.950 
up you can keep moving throughout any
combos<00:05:05.270> so<00:05:06.160> I'll<00:05:07.160> show<00:05:07.370> you<00:05:07.400> here<00:05:07.900> where<00:05:08.900> I'm

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
combos so I'll show you here where I'm

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.310 
combos so I'll show you here where I'm
going<00:05:09.140> to<00:05:09.200> move<00:05:09.380> this<00:05:09.680> card<00:05:10.010> out<00:05:11.020> and<00:05:12.020> I'll

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
going to move this card out and I'll

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.730 
going to move this card out and I'll
rotate<00:05:12.770> it<00:05:12.980> so<00:05:13.190> the<00:05:13.340> blue<00:05:13.610> is<00:05:14.540> matching<00:05:15.080> I'll

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
rotate it so the blue is matching I'll

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.930 
rotate it so the blue is matching I'll
set<00:05:16.010> it<00:05:17.320> you<00:05:18.320> know<00:05:18.410> it's<00:05:18.950> important<00:05:19.400> to<00:05:19.700> match

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
set it you know it's important to match

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:26.160 
set it you know it's important to match
them<00:05:20.240> up<00:05:22.870> so<00:05:23.870> I'll<00:05:23.960> set<00:05:24.260> this<00:05:24.500> card<00:05:24.890> I<00:05:25.160> can<00:05:25.640> move

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:26.170 
them up so I'll set this card I can move

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:31.000 
them up so I'll set this card I can move
one<00:05:28.510> again<00:05:29.510> over<00:05:30.020> to<00:05:30.170> this<00:05:30.290> react<00:05:30.650> card

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
one again over to this react card

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.220 
one again over to this react card
because<00:05:31.460> they're<00:05:31.700> matching<00:05:31.940> if<00:05:32.900> they<00:05:33.080> weren't

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:33.230 
because they're matching if they weren't

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.860 
because they're matching if they weren't
matching<00:05:33.440> I<00:05:33.740> couldn't<00:05:34.070> keep<00:05:34.400> moving<00:05:34.820> it's<00:05:35.750> my

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870
