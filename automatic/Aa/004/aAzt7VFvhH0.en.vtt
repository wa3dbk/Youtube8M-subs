imagine how what if I could look at my

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.770 
imagine how what if I could look at my
stats<00:03:14.430> I<00:03:14.610> don't<00:03:14.790> know<00:03:14.880> it<00:03:15.120> would<00:03:15.239> be<00:03:15.420> like<00:03:15.599> a

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
stats I don't know it would be like a

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.050 
stats I don't know it would be like a
month<00:03:16.049> worth<00:03:16.470> of<00:03:16.680> hours<00:03:17.069> I'm<00:03:17.579> telling<00:03:17.910> you<00:03:18.000> I

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
played the game so much and I never got

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.039 
played the game so much and I never got
to<00:03:20.910> play<00:03:20.940> smash<00:03:21.329> that<00:03:21.540> much<00:03:21.660> because<00:03:21.750> I<00:03:21.840> played

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
to play smash that much because I played

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.020 
to play smash that much because I played

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
brawl like once or twice and that was

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.280 
brawl like once or twice and that was
about<00:03:26.130> it<00:03:26.400> and<00:03:26.609> so<00:03:27.239> I'm<00:03:27.660> really<00:03:27.780> excited<00:03:27.959> to

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
about it and so I'm really excited to

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.580 
about it and so I'm really excited to
get<00:03:28.410> into<00:03:28.769> the<00:03:29.430> new<00:03:29.549> Smash<00:03:29.850> Brothers<00:03:30.590> but

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
get into the new Smash Brothers but

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.289 
get into the new Smash Brothers but
anyways<00:03:31.980> back<00:03:32.280> back<00:03:32.579> on<00:03:32.730> track<00:03:32.910> the<00:03:33.090> Smash

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
anyways back back on track the Smash

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.140 
anyways back back on track the Smash
Brothers<00:03:33.510> if<00:03:33.900> this<00:03:34.290> game<00:03:34.530> came<00:03:34.859> to<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.609> Vita

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
Brothers if this game came to the Vita

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.729 
Brothers if this game came to the Vita
instead<00:03:37.109> of<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.290> 3ds

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
instead of the 3ds

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.009 
instead of the 3ds
it<00:03:38.190> would<00:03:38.400> probably<00:03:38.609> an<00:03:39.000> exact<00:03:39.359> replica<00:03:39.870> of

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
it would probably an exact replica of

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.960 
it would probably an exact replica of
the<00:03:40.109> Wii<00:03:40.380> U<00:03:40.590> version<00:03:40.890> and<00:03:41.250> that<00:03:41.700> would<00:03:41.819> be

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
the Wii U version and that would be

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.120 
the Wii U version and that would be
amazing<00:03:42.269> because<00:03:42.630> this<00:03:43.139> 3ds<00:03:43.620> version<00:03:44.010> is

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
amazing because this 3ds version is

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.520 
amazing because this 3ds version is
getting<00:03:44.370> so<00:03:44.609> dumbed<00:03:44.970> down<00:03:45.090> because<00:03:45.780> of<00:03:45.930> 3ds<00:03:46.290> is

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
getting so dumbed down because of 3ds is

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.770 
getting so dumbed down because of 3ds is
so<00:03:46.739> weak<00:03:47.069> you<00:03:47.100> know<00:03:47.370> like<00:03:48.030> I'm<00:03:48.180> surprised<00:03:48.630> it

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
so weak you know like I'm surprised it

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.599 
so weak you know like I'm surprised it
even<00:03:49.019> fits<00:03:49.230> on<00:03:49.470> it<00:03:49.620> and<00:03:49.829> I<00:03:50.010> don't<00:03:50.310> know<00:03:50.519> how

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
even fits on it and I don't know how

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.729 
even fits on it and I don't know how
it's<00:03:50.790> gonna<00:03:50.910> run<00:03:51.209> the<00:03:52.019> Wii<00:03:52.200> U<00:03:52.319> version<00:03:52.530> is

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
it's gonna run the Wii U version is

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.039 
it's gonna run the Wii U version is
gonna<00:03:52.889> run<00:03:53.069> at<00:03:53.220> 60fps<00:03:53.639> while<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.329> 3ds<00:03:54.959> version

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
gonna run at 60fps while the 3ds version

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.470 
gonna run at 60fps while the 3ds version
is<00:03:55.380> gonna<00:03:55.530> run<00:03:55.680> at<00:03:55.850> sort<00:03:56.850> of<00:03:56.940> I<00:03:57.120> think<00:03:57.180> they

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
is gonna run at sort of I think they

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.860 
is gonna run at sort of I think they
even<00:03:57.750> said<00:03:58.019> a<00:03:58.200> 30fps<00:03:59.040> n<00:03:59.430> or<00:03:59.549> drop<00:03:59.790> to<00:03:59.940> 20<00:04:00.209> FPS<00:04:00.660> at

even said a 30fps n or drop to 20 FPS at

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.780 
even said a 30fps n or drop to 20 FPS at
times<00:04:01.170> at<00:04:01.500> times<00:04:01.920> where<00:04:02.190> a<00:04:02.250> lot<00:04:02.400> of<00:04:02.489> stuff<00:04:02.700> is

times at times where a lot of stuff is

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.699 
times at times where a lot of stuff is
going<00:04:03.060> on<00:04:03.180> and<00:04:03.420> they<00:04:03.989> had<00:04:04.109> to<00:04:04.230> change<00:04:04.470> up<00:04:04.590> the

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
going on and they had to change up the

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.740 
going on and they had to change up the
maps<00:04:04.950> because<00:04:05.160> 3ds<00:04:05.819> couldn't<00:04:06.239> handle<00:04:06.480> all<00:04:06.569> the

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750

Lag in some netcode problems happen but
it's<00:04:26.960> not<00:04:27.110> all<00:04:27.350> because<00:04:27.590> of<00:04:28.040> the<00:04:28.190> video<00:04:28.430> to<00:04:28.550> ps3

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
very stable not as good which is another

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.880 
very stable not as good which is another
problem<00:04:35.390> that<00:04:35.690> playstation<00:04:36.350> also<00:04:36.590> has<00:04:36.680> had

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.100 
another problem but like I said like I'm
saying<00:04:42.500> like<00:04:42.710> I<00:04:42.800> was<00:04:42.980> saying<00:04:43.510> it<00:04:44.510> would<00:04:44.720> be<00:04:44.870> an

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
saying like I was saying it would be an

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.990 
saying like I was saying it would be an
exact<00:04:45.680> replica<00:04:46.130> of<00:04:46.190> the<00:04:46.280> Wii<00:04:46.400> U<00:04:46.550> version<00:04:46.730> on

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
exact replica of the Wii U version on

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.760 
exact replica of the Wii U version on
the<00:04:47.090> PS<00:04:47.420> Vita<00:04:47.660> and<00:04:48.020> you<00:04:48.140> probably<00:04:48.500> be<00:04:48.560> able<00:04:48.650> to

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
the PS Vita and you probably be able to

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.680 
the PS Vita and you probably be able to
do<00:04:48.860> cross<00:04:49.160> play<00:04:49.490> that's<00:04:49.880> the<00:04:50.030> first<00:04:50.300> that's

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
do cross play that's the first that's

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:51.910 
do cross play that's the first that's
the<00:04:50.840> first<00:04:50.900> cross<00:04:51.320> play<00:04:51.500> that<00:04:51.680> would<00:04:51.770> ever

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:51.920 
the first cross play that would ever

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.970 
the first cross play that would ever
happen<00:04:52.040> in<00:04:52.520> the<00:04:52.640> Nintendo<00:04:53.120> ecosystem<00:04:53.870> and<00:04:54.800> it

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
happen in the Nintendo ecosystem and it

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.800 
happen in the Nintendo ecosystem and it
would<00:04:55.100> probably<00:04:55.340> amazing<00:04:56.300> I'm<00:04:56.390> telling<00:04:56.720> you

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
would probably amazing I'm telling you

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.840 
would probably amazing I'm telling you
it<00:04:57.260> would<00:04:57.410> get<00:04:57.560> so<00:04:57.860> much<00:04:58.070> that<00:04:58.490> would<00:04:58.610> probably

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
it would get so much that would probably

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.360 
it would get so much that would probably
save<00:04:59.300> the<00:04:59.480> Vita<00:04:59.690> it<00:04:59.900> would<00:05:00.050> make<00:05:00.500> the<00:05:00.650> Vita<00:05:00.920> so

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
save the Vita it would make the Vita so

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:02.920 
save the Vita it would make the Vita so
big<00:05:01.610> people<00:05:01.820> would<00:05:02.000> buy<00:05:02.180> it<00:05:02.240> so<00:05:02.660> they<00:05:02.750> could

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
big people would buy it so they could

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.570 
big people would buy it so they could
practice<00:05:03.140> on<00:05:03.530> the<00:05:03.680> go<00:05:03.860> and<00:05:04.070> stuff<00:05:04.250> like<00:05:04.400> that

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
practice on the go and stuff like that

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.250 
practice on the go and stuff like that
they<00:05:04.730> could<00:05:04.880> practice<00:05:05.210> combos<00:05:05.900> on<00:05:06.050> the<00:05:06.140> go

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
they could practice combos on the go

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.570 
they could practice combos on the go
that's<00:05:06.530> exactly<00:05:06.980> what<00:05:07.130> would<00:05:07.280> happen<00:05:07.490> with

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
that's exactly what would happen with

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.830 
that's exactly what would happen with
places<00:05:07.910> and<00:05:08.030> all-stars<00:05:08.390> but<00:05:08.510> the<00:05:08.630> thing<00:05:08.810> is

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
places and all-stars but the thing is

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.080 
places and all-stars but the thing is
the<00:05:08.990> game<00:05:09.170> wasn't<00:05:09.410> very<00:05:09.680> big<00:05:10.010> and<00:05:10.340> that<00:05:10.970> that's

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
the game wasn't very big and that that's

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.960 
the game wasn't very big and that that's
what<00:05:11.330> really<00:05:11.360> really<00:05:11.690> heard<00:05:12.200> it<00:05:12.350> but<00:05:12.920> the<00:05:13.730> Vita

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
what really really heard it but the Vita

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.300 
what really really heard it but the Vita
has<00:05:14.210> enough<00:05:14.480> power<00:05:14.750> to<00:05:14.810> replicate<00:05:15.740> a<00:05:15.920> smash

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
has enough power to replicate a smash

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.040 
has enough power to replicate a smash
and<00:05:16.790> if<00:05:17.630> it<00:05:17.960> could<00:05:18.110> happen<00:05:18.350> oh<00:05:18.800> my<00:05:19.160> god<00:05:19.550> man<00:05:20.050> but

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
and if it could happen oh my god man but

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.200 
and if it could happen oh my god man but
of<00:05:21.170> course<00:05:21.200> they<00:05:21.650> put<00:05:21.800> it<00:05:21.920> on<00:05:21.980> the<00:05:22.100> crappy<00:05:22.730> 3ds

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
of course they put it on the crappy 3ds

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.120 
of course they put it on the crappy 3ds
that<00:05:23.600> can't<00:05:23.960> that<00:05:24.170> can<00:05:24.290> barely<00:05:24.680> handle<00:05:24.860> it

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
that can't that can barely handle it
