00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.430
 very good all guys proposal of 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.950
 demolition black ops all with the weapon 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.890
 that is possibly 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.360
 the most bipolar of the game does not suat and 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.860
 why do I say people pay before anything 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.480
 you have here without at the beginning I take it without 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.330
 look with silencer with stock because 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.490
 it kills a lot but luck has 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.080
 good things and bad things before bonuses 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.540
 nothing to tell you that this is the way 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.340
 demolition and how are you going to see it is not going 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.720
 to be Russian pulled out but obviously in a 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.700
 new port the map of what so for 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.700
 very small that it is and you have to have 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.260
 note that often is pilla 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:48.100
 a lot of respawn but good the truth that 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:51.070
 it's a game because it's brutal there 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.560
 that to say it is a game cojonuda me 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.420
 fans low many deaths too and 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.760
 we see say that the single stress more 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.510
 bipolar because it has a good thing and 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.510
 a bad thing 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.340
 the good thing is that at long distances 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.460
 It destroys the bad thing is that face to face 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.840
 you do not eat a damn colin this 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.180
 it means to get a remove fit 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.560
 with swat is not very bad is not very difficult 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.210
 to witness online with three bullets 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.729
 that loads all but is it 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:19.270
 nuclear and to get a nuclear what 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:22.359
 complicated is that you will say 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.340
 because I say because you can deduce that 

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:26.229
 is starting to try to get me the 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.390
 nuclear with the suat and be seen with some 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.700
 how many odd streaks because I'm 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.039
 trying to get her out playing almost alone with 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.920
 a player with a maximum of 2 and 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.539
 clear the lack of having uve schatz is going to 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.159
 make the enemy take many 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:40.479
 flags like I want to play dominoes and 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.310
 I do not want to play demolition because I do not 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.689
 I want to catch respawn obviously 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.600
 whatever happens, the 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:47.979
 You get a streak of 20 out of 25 not 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.360
 he has his attractive looks all the time and 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.709
 obviously they kill you in the back 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.200
 they wait for the remainder to do any 

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:54.710
 thing then that has good things and 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.330
 bad things 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.799
 go up to the next chapter of 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.479
 nuclear subscriber with the suat and 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.130
 surely and surely he was very 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.030
 cool and for me it will have much merit 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.650
 and I'm doing it to me 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.500
 costing quite two days 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.030
 trying for about 23 hours and still not 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.950
 has fallen I hope it falls soon because 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.360
 I annoy me a lot of me out right now 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.940
 representations to nuclear cable because 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.260
 I'm a lot luckier but I do not think 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.670
 It takes a long time and it is true that 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.959
 continue with the nuclear series of 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.310
 subscriber because I know that those that 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.620
 are few are many are very 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.360
 repetitive but the nuclear ones 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.400
 have nuclear telita have abrupt 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.959
 Clouds can be used a lot though 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.220
 right now I'm getting my streak in 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.720
 the car is worth not judge me is 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.540
 demolition I'm trying to do 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.600
 I prefer to get the truth because good 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.360
 You already know the or many acts as 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.519
 you are seeing now not saying a soft 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.269
 silencer cylinder head what I always carry 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:47.300
 comes out with hard line scavenger hardness 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.700
 and tactical mask that can carry most 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.370
 so as not to improve the performance 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.800
 Well, if they throw you many pm it's if we 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.140
 they throw many Uruguayans of answer then 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.610
 maybe they could take I do not know I think 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.420
 what electronic resistance would come from 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.769
 luxury that these advantages can remove to 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.959
 change of electronic resistance by 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.959
 I would say scavenger, not because 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.160
 you need to get us out the nuclear 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.690
 hardness you can remove if you know how to play 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.860
 without hardness we can become a scavenger and 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.230
 electronic resistance more in the 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.670
 tactics then there would go today is cured 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.130
 of terror one hundred percent not 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.829
 they could put grenades because you had the 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.140
 vest or stress ligatures ni pm es 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.980
 nor guaguas of answer in general is 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.920
 a pretty chet class 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.629
 I do not know how many things that are done in the 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.760
 heading to the best 4 I have no idea 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:33.870
 how many 4 ago I think two are one thing 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.780
 yes but any of killing four 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.750
 followed with the suat 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.340
 and a good game what happens that no 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.170
 they started as I said in a super video 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.890
 hard to be wat suite as I said in 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.690
 a video is difficult if perhaps more nuclear 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.520
 to Russia with weapons as complicated as 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.870
 they have to have patience 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.520
 keep in mind that at the beginning the 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.860
 game was much easier at the beginning 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.840
 of the game he simply picked up the pse or 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.010
 they brought out people of all kinds people who 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.750
 it takes us from the parties people who 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.100
 it held up what people chats 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.590
 I got in all the time because there were so many 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.150
 people playing however now now 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.280
 the thing changes a lot, people leave 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.170
 the games in 90 new people as soon as 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.180
 people hear cubesat is going this 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.709
 complicated 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.840
 playing with the leaves this complicates 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.479
 take off nuclear and combine the two things 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.829
 it's quite difficult that's why it's equal to 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:20.959
 I like to talk to the two of them in fact 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.280
 I like the best almost more than the cost and 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.889
 as I know you're liking them much 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.720
 two whites because I want to upload it and 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.009
 I want to have good games and how do 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.259
 time we do not have a good departure 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:33.590
 then fuck part of the special 5000 that 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:35.419
 will be then in a few days I do not know 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.280
 what to say or how many days but I hope that 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:39.590
 be soon because I want it to be luxury 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.570
 be a montage a compilation of this 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.000
 departure is a similar thing of my 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.199
 beginnings because the special cucumber 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.030
 cucumber is going to be special 10,000 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:48.979
 subscribers as I told you not to 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.539
 I think to expect nothing that will be in 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:52.340
 months and months I hope that as soon as possible 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:54.470
 better not but I'm sure you like it and 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.470
 a lot of what I 'm seeing is killing me 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:00.110
 a lot but a lot but I swell with the 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.419
 suat this weapon kills a lot kills a lot 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.310
 long distances kills a short shit 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:05.479
 distances you see in new upside down that 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.310
 he copied the courts the short ones 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:08.569
 distances is lethal to the most distances 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.009
 it leaves much to be desired 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:12.889
 but obviously a weapon can not 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:14.389
 have everything for yourself we already have 124 of 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:17.149
 everyone who thinks is in that aspect 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:18.860
 you think the same as me the 94 long l 

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:21.080
 distances is the support agrees 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.910
 distances is not bad and that makes it 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.760
 the best of the game in public 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.770
 better balance every forgiveness cadence 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.100
 damage scope of everything that is very 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.890
 complete 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:36.280
 a swatch of ammunition swat something 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.780
 different weapon different black ops 2 yo 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.130
 I think you will thank him tomorrow 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.530
 upload the league video in the call of 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:44.260
 duty cost the best in whites 2 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.090
 I still do not know everything to see it and I hope 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.640
 that the next game of white my 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:51.040
 two that goes up or the next streak that 

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:54.100
 come up with the weapon be a nuclear with the 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.620
 suat and it's more of a 40s streak or if 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.910
 not a 30- card super streak that is what 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.140
 what I want and I want 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.460
 enjoy with her so good 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.740
 I promise to bring him in that with the 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.060
 I will take time but devote all the 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.040
 time you have to play call of duty 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.600
 to get me the nuclear tail sun 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.190
 I hope you liked the video I hope 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.530
 that has not been true either 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.060
 roaming and catching respawn but I wanted to 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.890
 you want 6 how is this time to do 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.330
 how much does it kill I hope you liked the 

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:19.320
 video guys, I do not have anything here 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.320
 the favorites already this morning
