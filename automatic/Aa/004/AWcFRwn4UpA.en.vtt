00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.220
 how about friends transforming into this 

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:07.730
 I bring you the revision of the 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:11.120
 line reality show star frame that is like this 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.460
 as a commemoration of which one 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.639
 as you can see it is identical 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.639
 to the 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.800
 al councilman these win of the g1 very 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:23.789
 similar in its physiognomy colors 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.170
 etc 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:31.160
 it is very similar to what he is 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.850
 the classics that I have at hand 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.620
 and this then from there we see the 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.680
 difference in size but also very 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.870
 important and we see the great resemblance that 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:46.760
 It has the figurine south cooperation 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:51.210
 on the other hand in this case 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:53.010
 but well this is the way you see it 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.570
 what are the feet and what are the feet 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:00.989
 the color the red the cabin the breasts 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:05.129
 everything is practically identical even 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.920
 even in what is the little tip 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:12.590
 also this will be yours will be this so 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.679
 even in that you can see he looks very good 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.979
 the being good this little one is 

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:20.840
 very well done sincerely is of the 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.969
 best figures that I have seen in the 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.679
 tiny one mainly because its 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:27.590
 transformation is not as simple as 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:29.000
 It may seem but it is very good and very 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.700
 ingenious the first thing we're going to do 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.240
 is to put obstacles in this and we are going to 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.659
 bend it to fold it like this so that 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.399
 stay in the cabin and already what are the 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.350
 arms what are the arms already what 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.319
 we can separate forward we put 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.599
 well this one way is that they are like this 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:49.719
 are going to form these same arms are going to 

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:53.539
 form part of the turbines of 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:56.840
 plane and start like this we can already put the 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.610
 cabin these things that are the rays 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.789
 who bring their hands is artfully 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:05.270
 they are also what is for this part 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:06.560
 from here of the area and it has holes 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.989
 so you do not have to be struggling 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.849
 any that does not look good and everything does not 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.950
 because it has some holes and I've already done 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:15.349
 The whole idea does not look very good 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.750
 bring your heat sign and like you 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.060
 you can see there are two east of here and one of 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.860
 that there is another little box that comes like this but 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.629
 Well this is because when we put the 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.440
 wings first we separate what is of this 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.930
 part of here from the wing 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.050
 then so that it can happen and they're going 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.910
 putting this way we are going it folding and here 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.620
 is this this little picture that is here in 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.020
 this room is the one that is going to go here 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.690
 so you just have to find that 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.120
 run out of staple and that makes the plane 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.160
 it is staying and logically they are already 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.470
 the two rear wings and then see with 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.950
 the next one does exactly what 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.930
 the same one looks for an airplane is tightened and 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:57.550
 good in this way that the 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:03:00.010
 airplane be swing of the line 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:04.299
 this left rebel 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:08.230
 small edition pocket edition and no 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:10.239
 it's been very very very good I know 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.939
 I recommend hyper recommend this peace of 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.430
 design also like my megatron 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:17.920
 I could not get it at the time this 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.489
 if even I still did not see him 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.739
 the only thing I never saw was the pro bowl and 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.360
 the hype because the stick so 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.560
 get to see here in the super but not 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.200
 he reaches it to buy the same thing 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.109
 I thank my friend very much and next 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.329
 nor gerardo friend to and of relation of 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:38.079
 mexico that got it and well then 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:40.209
 this one is very unique father defect this 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:42.340
 this is the only defect is the little ball 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.310
 I feel that it was not very good but good 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.540
 It was too much but not too good 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.329
 is the transform behind your 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.269
 download decal as well as if 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:54.099
 outside one of the important and good 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.019
 something that I did not show very well then what 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:56.950
 is the head but we must adapt the 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.630
 is 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.580
 see the good looks of a garment of 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:06.120
 of paint and then I'm going to remove it or 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:08.340
 it was painted in black and it is already very 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.700
 father the figure and I recommend them 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:14.490
 well this has been my review of this 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.170
 excellent star figure and I hope that 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:20.660
 you liked it we are pending for 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.660
