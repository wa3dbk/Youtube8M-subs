the most challenging times in my
romantic<00:00:34.690> relationship<00:00:35.620> it's<00:00:35.859> because<00:00:36.190> we

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
romantic relationship it's because we

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.709 
romantic relationship it's because we
stopped<00:00:36.609> being<00:00:36.850> compassionate<00:00:37.239> for<00:00:37.600> each

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:37.719 
stopped being compassionate for each

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:39.180 
stopped being compassionate for each
other<00:00:37.929> it's<00:00:38.140> because<00:00:38.409> we<00:00:38.530> were<00:00:38.679> stressed<00:00:38.949> out
