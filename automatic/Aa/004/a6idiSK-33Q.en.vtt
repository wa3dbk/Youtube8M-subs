time<00:00:15.570> of<00:00:15.750> this<00:00:15.900> recording<00:00:16.080> I'll<00:00:16.529> be<00:00:16.650> using<00:00:16.830> a

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119 
time of this recording I'll be using a

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.189 
time of this recording I'll be using a
review<00:00:18.119> copy<00:00:18.330> that<00:00:18.600> was<00:00:18.720> sent<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.410> me<00:00:19.590> but<00:00:21.199> so

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
review copy that was sent to me but so

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.070 
review copy that was sent to me but so
there<00:00:22.410> may<00:00:22.529> be<00:00:22.560> some<00:00:22.920> changes<00:00:23.990> to<00:00:24.990> the

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
there may be some changes to the

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.810 
there may be some changes to the
interface<00:00:25.289> or<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:26.010> know<00:00:26.130> functionality

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
interface or you know functionality

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.400 
interface or you know functionality
there<00:00:27.029> maybe<00:00:27.180> even<00:00:27.599> be<00:00:27.779> one<00:00:27.990> or<00:00:28.109> two<00:00:28.140> little

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
there maybe even be one or two little

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.370 
there maybe even be one or two little
glitches<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.189> see<00:00:29.490> along<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.570> way<00:00:30.689> but

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
glitches that you see along the way but

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.620 
glitches that you see along the way but
what<00:00:32.070> I'm<00:00:32.160> going<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.460> do<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.669> talk<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.300> through

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
what I'm going to do is talk you through

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.560 
what I'm going to do is talk you through
the<00:00:34.350> uses<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.430> limitations<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.420> the

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
the uses and the limitations and the

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.590 
the uses and the limitations and the
basics<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.170> morphing<00:00:37.800> which<00:00:38.550> as<00:00:39.149> you'll<00:00:39.390> see

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
basics of morphing which as you'll see

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.869 
basics of morphing which as you'll see
is<00:00:39.809> kind<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.440> like<00:00:40.620> if<00:00:40.739> you're<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:40.920> flash<00:00:41.579> user

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
is kind of like if you're a flash user

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.450 
is kind of like if you're a flash user
it's<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.540> if<00:00:42.809> it's<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.620> flash<00:00:43.829> equivalent<00:00:44.370> of

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
it's the if it's the flash equivalent of

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.510 
it's the if it's the flash equivalent of
shape<00:00:44.700> tweening<00:00:45.030> which<00:00:45.710> can<00:00:46.710> take<00:00:46.920> two<00:00:47.250> key

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
shape tweening which can take two key

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.279 
shape tweening which can take two key
drawings<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.390> do<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.870> it

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
drawings that you do and it

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.729 
drawings that you do and it
automatically<00:00:49.860> in-betweens<00:00:50.460> those<00:00:50.730> for<00:00:51.090> you

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
automatically in-betweens those for you

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.860 
automatically in-betweens those for you
but<00:00:52.739> most<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.610> time<00:00:53.820> or<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.239> lot<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.809> the

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
but most of the time or a lot of the

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.369 
but most of the time or a lot of the
time<00:00:55.079> especially<00:00:55.770> with<00:00:56.219> more<00:00:56.460> complex<00:00:56.940> shapes

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
time especially with more complex shapes

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.549 
time especially with more complex shapes
a<00:00:58.379> morph<00:00:59.039> or<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.309> shape<00:00:59.609> tween<00:00:59.820> can<00:01:00.449> often<00:01:00.960> screw

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
a morph or a shape tween can often screw

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.770 
a morph or a shape tween can often screw
up<00:01:01.710> badly<00:01:02.039> because<00:01:02.460> what<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.300> computer<00:01:03.690> is

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
up badly because what the computer is

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.570 
up badly because what the computer is
trying<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.080> do<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.350> guess<00:01:04.650> what<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.100> mean<00:01:05.339> and

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
trying to do is guess what you mean and

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.250 
trying to do is guess what you mean and
if<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.299> have<00:01:07.189> one<00:01:08.189> shape<00:01:08.689> you<00:01:09.689> know<00:01:09.900> how<00:01:10.200> you

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
if you have one shape you know how you

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260 
if you have one shape you know how you
want<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.979> move<00:01:11.159> into<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.729> second<00:01:12.060> shape

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
want it to move into the second shape

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.390 
want it to move into the second shape
but<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.320> computer<00:01:13.680> doesn't<00:01:13.830> necessarily

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
but the computer doesn't necessarily

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.710 
but the computer doesn't necessarily
know<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.000> might<00:01:15.119> guess<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.570> wrong

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
know that and it might guess the wrong

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.510 
know that and it might guess the wrong
way<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:15.990> it's<00:01:16.380> automatic<00:01:17.090> tweening<00:01:18.090> could

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
way so it's automatic tweening could

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.560 
way so it's automatic tweening could
could<00:01:20.520> be<00:01:20.670> completely<00:01:21.119> different<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.540> what

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
could be completely different to what

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.210 
could be completely different to what
you<00:01:21.780> expect<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.409> there<00:01:22.590> are<00:01:22.680> ways<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.890> control

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
you expect so there are ways to control

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.179 
you expect so there are ways to control
them<00:01:23.670> off<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:24.720> tune<00:01:24.960> boom<00:01:25.229> just<00:01:25.890> like<00:01:26.040> there

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
them off in tune boom just like there

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.230 
them off in tune boom just like there
are<00:01:26.220> in<00:01:26.460> flash<00:01:27.890> using<00:01:28.890> hints<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.460> things<00:01:29.670> so

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
are in flash using hints and things so

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.969 
are in flash using hints and things so
this<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:31.110> series<00:01:31.470> we're<00:01:31.590> going<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.740> quickly

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
this this series we're going to quickly

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.640 
this this series we're going to quickly
talk<00:01:32.369> about<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:33.360> basics<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.900> morphing<00:01:34.380> the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
talk about the basics of morphing the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:41.140 
talk about the basics of morphing the
the<00:01:34.860> uses<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.340> limitations<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.619> so<00:01:37.619> forth<00:01:39.380> so

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
the uses the limitations and so forth so

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.330 
the uses the limitations and so forth so
let's<00:01:42.150> open<00:01:42.360> up<00:01:42.799> animate<00:01:43.799> pro<00:01:44.040> 2<00:01:44.329> and<00:01:45.329> make<00:01:46.020> pro

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
let's open up animate pro 2 and make pro

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.490 
let's open up animate pro 2 and make pro
it<00:01:47.340> says<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:47.729> i'm<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.909> pro<00:01:48.180> but<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.350> the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
it says that i'm a pro but this is the

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.450 
it says that i'm a pro but this is the
review<00:01:49.920> copy<00:01:51.049> now<00:01:52.049> let's<00:01:52.320> see<00:01:52.530> more<00:01:52.920> patoot

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
review copy now let's see more patoot

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.109 
review copy now let's see more patoot
might<00:01:53.850> do<00:01:54.119> i've<00:01:55.340> been<00:01:56.340> doing<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.640> few<00:01:59.119> playing

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
might do i've been doing a few playing

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.609 
might do i've been doing a few playing
with<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.299> few<00:02:00.509> files<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:01.079> is<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.320> one<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.560> I

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
with a few files this is the one that I

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.249 
with a few files this is the one that I
want<00:02:01.860> that's<00:02:02.040> got<00:02:02.219> nothing<00:02:02.490> in<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:02.869> right<00:02:03.869> so

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
want that's got nothing in it right so

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.520 
want that's got nothing in it right so
jumping<00:02:04.920> right<00:02:05.070> into<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.490> I'm<00:02:05.640> going<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:06.530> the

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
jumping right into it I'm going to the

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.190 
jumping right into it I'm going to the
example<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.099> like<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.340> use<00:02:08.660> straight<00:02:09.660> off<00:02:09.840> the

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
example I like to use straight off the

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.309 
example I like to use straight off the
bat<00:02:10.349> when<00:02:10.590> teaching<00:02:10.830> people<00:02:11.160> morphing<00:02:11.879> is

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
about doing to two key drawings what

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:46.759 
about doing to two key drawings what
you've<00:02:45.750> got<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.049> do<00:02:46.169> what<00:02:46.379> you've<00:02:46.500> got<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:46.739> keep

in<00:02:47.010> mind<00:02:47.250> is<00:02:47.459> that<00:02:47.669> even<00:02:47.879> with<00:02:48.510> traditional

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
in mind is that even with traditional

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.319 
in mind is that even with traditional
animation<00:02:49.349> where<00:02:49.769> you've<00:02:50.269> you're<00:02:51.269> an

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
animation where you've you're an

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.659 
animation where you've you're an
animator<00:02:51.659> and<00:02:51.840> you<00:02:52.560> do<00:02:52.769> the<00:02:52.889> key<00:02:53.069> drawings<00:02:53.489> and

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:53.669 
animator and you do the key drawings and

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:55.189 
animator and you do the key drawings and
then<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:53.909> in<00:02:54.060> between<00:02:54.359> it<00:02:54.510> comes<00:02:54.689> along<00:02:54.989> and

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:55.199 
then and in between it comes along and

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:57.129 
then and in between it comes along and
fills<00:02:55.709> in<00:02:55.889> the<00:02:55.980> gaps<00:02:56.189> between<00:02:56.370> your<00:02:56.549> drawings

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:57.139 
fills in the gaps between your drawings

00:02:57.139 --> 00:02:59.209 
fills in the gaps between your drawings
the<00:02:58.139> in-betweener<00:02:58.620> isn't<00:02:58.859> going<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.099> do

00:02:59.209 --> 00:02:59.219 
the in-betweener isn't going to do

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:00.619 
the in-betweener isn't going to do
something<00:02:59.459> completely<00:03:00.060> random<00:03:00.239> they're

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
something completely random they're

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.199 
something completely random they're
going<00:03:00.840> to<00:03:00.959> see<00:03:01.169> how<00:03:01.469> you<00:03:01.699> you<00:03:02.699> plan<00:03:03.030> the

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
going to see how you you plan the

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.089 
going to see how you you plan the
movement<00:03:03.659> how<00:03:03.810> you<00:03:03.870> want<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.439> movement<00:03:04.859> to<00:03:04.949> go

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
movement how you want the movement to go

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.429 
movement how you want the movement to go
so<00:03:05.430> when<00:03:06.269> you're<00:03:06.419> doing<00:03:06.540> your<00:03:06.689> drawings<00:03:07.169> for

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:07.439 
so when you're doing your drawings for

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:12.140 
so when you're doing your drawings for
morphing<00:03:07.859> make<00:03:08.459> sure<00:03:08.699> that<00:03:08.909> you<00:03:10.760> that<00:03:11.760> you<00:03:11.909> put

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
morphing make sure that you that you put

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:18.319 
morphing make sure that you that you put
that<00:03:13.819> you<00:03:14.819> make<00:03:15.000> it<00:03:15.379> kind<00:03:16.379> of<00:03:17.000> what<00:03:18.000> do<00:03:18.060> you<00:03:18.150> say

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
that you make it kind of what do you say

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.689 
that you make it kind of what do you say
you<00:03:18.389> make<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:19.099> understandable<00:03:20.099> you<00:03:20.370> make<00:03:20.549> it

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:20.699 
you make it understandable you make it

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:23.390 
you make it understandable you make it
reasonable<00:03:21.269> so<00:03:21.959> in<00:03:22.139> my<00:03:22.259> second<00:03:22.709> drawing<00:03:23.040> here

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
reasonable so in my second drawing here

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.619 
reasonable so in my second drawing here
you<00:03:23.970> can<00:03:24.120> see<00:03:24.359> how<00:03:24.599> with<00:03:25.379> each<00:03:25.939> curve<00:03:26.939> or<00:03:27.299> a

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
you can see how with each curve or a

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.170 
you can see how with each curve or a
little<00:03:28.019> lump<00:03:28.290> or<00:03:28.650> whatever<00:03:29.009> in<00:03:29.579> the<00:03:29.849> first

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
little lump or whatever in the first

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.069 
little lump or whatever in the first
drawing<00:03:30.870> I'm<00:03:31.579> making<00:03:32.579> it<00:03:32.729> continue<00:03:33.269> and<00:03:33.509> kind

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
drawing I'm making it continue and kind

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.780 
drawing I'm making it continue and kind
of<00:03:34.139> resolve<00:03:34.319> to<00:03:34.829> something<00:03:35.220> in<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.400> second

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
of resolve to something in the second

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.550 
of resolve to something in the second
drawing<00:03:35.970> these<00:03:36.269> aren't<00:03:36.509> just<00:03:36.810> random<00:03:37.019> shapes

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
drawing these aren't just random shapes

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.770 
drawing these aren't just random shapes
I'm<00:03:37.859> animating<00:03:38.189> here<00:03:38.759> and<00:03:38.939> that's<00:03:39.569> what<00:03:39.720> you

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
I'm animating here and that's what you

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.210 
I'm animating here and that's what you
should<00:03:39.810> be<00:03:40.049> doing<00:03:40.079> when<00:03:40.439> you<00:03:40.620> when<00:03:41.099> you're

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
should be doing when you when you're

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.030 
should be doing when you when you're
doing<00:03:41.430> your<00:03:41.459> key<00:03:41.759> drawings<00:03:42.180> for<00:03:42.449> morphing<00:03:43.040> you

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
doing your key drawings for morphing you

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.819 
doing your key drawings for morphing you
should<00:03:44.280> be<00:03:44.989> you<00:03:45.989> should<00:03:46.019> be<00:03:46.229> bearing<00:03:46.590> that<00:03:46.680> in

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
should be you should be bearing that in

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.229 
should be you should be bearing that in
mind<00:03:46.859> that<00:03:47.189> you<00:03:47.340> want<00:03:47.549> the<00:03:47.759> software<00:03:48.120> to

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
mind that you want the software to

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.719 
mind that you want the software to
easily<00:03:48.900> understand<00:03:49.409> what<00:03:49.590> you<00:03:49.919> are<00:03:50.189> trying<00:03:50.609> to

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:50.729 
easily understand what you are trying to

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:55.879 
easily understand what you are trying to
do<00:03:53.840> so<00:03:54.840> what<00:03:54.989> I've<00:03:55.109> done<00:03:55.290> there<00:03:55.500> let's<00:03:55.709> have<00:03:55.799> a

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
do so what I've done there let's have a

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:59.089 
do so what I've done there let's have a
look<00:03:56.099> at<00:03:56.549> the<00:03:56.699> two<00:03:56.879> two<00:03:57.239> drawings<00:03:57.540> I'll<00:03:58.099> go

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
look at the two two drawings I'll go

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.729 
look at the two two drawings I'll go
back<00:03:59.219> to<00:03:59.430> this<00:03:59.579> one<00:04:00.109> now<00:04:01.109> you<00:04:01.169> can<00:04:01.349> see<00:04:01.560> that

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
back to this one now you can see that

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.059 
back to this one now you can see that
I've<00:04:01.919> got<00:04:03.079> we've<00:04:04.079> got<00:04:04.290> a<00:04:04.319> lump<00:04:04.590> on<00:04:04.739> the<00:04:04.859> left

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
I've got we've got a lump on the left

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.459 
I've got we've got a lump on the left
then<00:04:05.430> then<00:04:06.060> it<00:04:06.180> curves<00:04:06.389> over<00:04:06.810> to<00:04:06.959> the<00:04:07.049> right<00:04:07.259> in

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:07.469 
then then it curves over to the right in

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:09.379 
then then it curves over to the right in
a<00:04:07.560> kind<00:04:07.769> of<00:04:07.799> a<00:04:07.889> number<00:04:08.159> three<00:04:08.430> shape<00:04:08.729> and<00:04:09.000> then

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
a kind of a number three shape and then

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:11.990 
a kind of a number three shape and then
going<00:04:09.989> up<00:04:10.109> its<00:04:10.650> got<00:04:10.739> another<00:04:10.979> lump<00:04:11.250> on<00:04:11.430> on<00:04:11.789> the

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
going up its got another lump on on the

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.209 
going up its got another lump on on the
left<00:04:12.269> and<00:04:12.569> then<00:04:13.109> it<00:04:13.199> curves<00:04:13.379> back<00:04:13.650> over<00:04:13.949> to<00:04:14.099> the

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:14.219 
left and then it curves back over to the

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:16.729 
left and then it curves back over to the
right<00:04:14.430> and<00:04:14.819> now<00:04:15.120> if<00:04:15.269> I<00:04:15.389> go<00:04:15.599> to<00:04:15.659> my<00:04:15.870> second<00:04:16.560> key

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
right and now if I go to my second key

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.219 
right and now if I go to my second key
drawing<00:04:17.159> the<00:04:17.940> same<00:04:18.150> thing<00:04:18.419> happens<00:04:18.840> but<00:04:19.079> it's

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
drawing the same thing happens but it's

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.080 
drawing the same thing happens but it's
in<00:04:19.349> a<00:04:19.440> different<00:04:20.719> different<00:04:21.719> kind<00:04:22.109> of<00:04:22.169> design

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
in a different different kind of design

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.840 
in a different different kind of design
but<00:04:24.090> you'll<00:04:24.300> see<00:04:24.570> that<00:04:24.800> number<00:04:25.800> one<00:04:26.010> here

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
but you'll see that number one here

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.720 
but you'll see that number one here
is<00:04:26.930> number<00:04:27.930> one<00:04:28.110> there<00:04:28.410> I'll<00:04:29.370> turn<00:04:29.580> on<00:04:29.610> the

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
is number one there I'll turn on the

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.710 
is number one there I'll turn on the
onion<00:04:30.000> skin<00:04:30.240> so<00:04:30.390> you<00:04:30.450> can<00:04:30.510> see<00:04:30.750> that<00:04:32.720> this

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
onion skin so you can see that this

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.850 
onion skin so you can see that this
number<00:04:34.710> three<00:04:35.010> shape<00:04:35.310> this<00:04:35.550> three<00:04:35.850> shape<00:04:36.120> is

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
number three shape this three shape is

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.770 
number three shape this three shape is
continued<00:04:37.860> up<00:04:38.040> and<00:04:38.250> back<00:04:39.150> here<00:04:39.360> on<00:04:39.420> the<00:04:39.510> first

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
continued up and back here on the first

continued up and back here on the first
key<00:04:40.080> this<00:04:41.040> one<00:04:41.310> number<00:04:41.490> two<00:04:41.850> number<00:04:42.630> two<00:04:42.780> so

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
key this one number two number two so

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.470 
key this one number two number two so
what<00:04:43.620> we've<00:04:43.770> got<00:04:44.040> from<00:04:44.700> each<00:04:44.880> drawing<00:04:45.210> we've
