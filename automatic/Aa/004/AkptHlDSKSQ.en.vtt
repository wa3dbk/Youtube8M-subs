particular video I will introduce you to

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.100 
particular video I will introduce you to
the<00:00:06.660> concept<00:00:07.170> of<00:00:07.319> view<00:00:07.950> model<00:00:08.340> okay<00:00:09.000> so<00:00:09.809> the

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
the concept of view model okay so the

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.320 
the concept of view model okay so the
best<00:00:10.320> way<00:00:10.530> to<00:00:10.800> understand<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.880> concept<00:00:11.910> of

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
best way to understand the concept of

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.930 
best way to understand the concept of
view<00:00:12.540> model<00:00:12.900> is<00:00:13.080> to<00:00:13.500> check<00:00:13.799> up<00:00:14.009> or<00:00:14.190> check<00:00:14.910> a

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
view model is to check up or check a

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.560 
view model is to check up or check a
view<00:00:15.420> that<00:00:16.260> will<00:00:16.710> need<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.430> view<00:00:17.520> model<00:00:17.850> so

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
view that will need a view model so

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.330 
view that will need a view model so
here's<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.869> view<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:19.890> you<00:00:20.010> can<00:00:20.130> see

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
here's the view and that you can see

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.790 
here's the view and that you can see
it's<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.640> registration<00:00:21.090> page<00:00:21.420> very<00:00:21.720> simple<00:00:22.140> you

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
it's a registration page very simple you

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.679 
it's a registration page very simple you
have<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.980> username<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.550> have<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.730> password<00:00:24.119> and

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
have a username you have a password and

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.589 
have a username you have a password and
you<00:00:25.140> have<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.350> reenter<00:00:26.189> password<00:00:26.760> now<00:00:27.480> if

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
you have a reenter password now if

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.769 
you have a reenter password now if
you're<00:00:27.750> using<00:00:27.949> the<00:00:28.949> binding<00:00:29.910> mechanism<00:00:30.599> of

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
you're using the binding mechanism of

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.670 
you're using the binding mechanism of
asp.net<00:00:31.289> MVC<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:33.149> want<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.450> bind<00:00:33.750> these

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
asp.net MVC and you want to bind these

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.000 
asp.net MVC and you want to bind these
three<00:00:35.190> fields<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:36.480> an<00:00:36.630> object<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.680> cannot

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
three fields to an object you cannot

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.610 
three fields to an object you cannot
really<00:00:38.340> bind<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.090> user<00:00:39.390> object<00:00:39.960> because

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
really bind it to a user object because

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.010 
really bind it to a user object because
a<00:00:40.649> user<00:00:41.070> object<00:00:41.190> does<00:00:41.700> not<00:00:41.730> contain<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.300> reenter

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
a user object does not contain a reenter

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.840 
a user object does not contain a reenter
password<00:00:43.440> field<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.890> mean<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.399> course<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.700> can

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
password field I mean of course you can

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.790 
password field I mean of course you can
go<00:00:45.120> ahead<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.510> add<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:46.230> re-enter<00:00:46.680> password

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
go ahead and add the re-enter password

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.389 
go ahead and add the re-enter password
field<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.480> user<00:00:49.079> object<00:00:49.559> but<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.829> wouldn't

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
field to the user object but it wouldn't

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.170 
field to the user object but it wouldn't
really<00:00:50.520> make<00:00:50.700> any<00:00:50.879> sense<00:00:50.969> right<00:00:52.670> so<00:00:53.670> my<00:00:53.879> user

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
really make any sense right so my user

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.720 
really make any sense right so my user
object<00:00:54.980> contain<00:00:55.980> just<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.280> username<00:00:56.520> and

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
object contain just a username and

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.599 
object contain just a username and
password<00:00:57.170> most<00:00:58.170> probably<00:00:58.500> this<00:00:58.890> will<00:00:59.070> be<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
password most probably this will be the

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.389 
password most probably this will be the
rakul<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.449> only<00:01:00.809> basis<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.920> attributes

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
rakul the only basis of the attributes

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.039 
rakul the only basis of the attributes
or<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.730> properties<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.539> will<00:01:03.690> contain

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
or the properties that it will contain

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.380 
or the properties that it will contain
right<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:06.590> so<00:01:07.590> how<00:01:07.830> can<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.220> capture<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:09.060> user

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
right and so how can I capture a user

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.260 
right and so how can I capture a user
name<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:10.100> password<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.310> re-enter<00:01:11.820> password

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
name and password and re-enter password

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.039 
name and password and re-enter password
or<00:01:12.869> how<00:01:13.650> can<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:15.770> create<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.890> class<00:01:17.810> that<00:01:18.810> will

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
or how can I create a class that will

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.410 
or how can I create a class that will
control<00:01:19.560> how<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.220> view<00:01:20.670> actually<00:01:21.000> works<00:01:21.210> or

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
control how the view actually works or

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.109 
control how the view actually works or
how<00:01:21.990> can<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.380> create<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.740> class<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.490> will

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
how can I create a class that will

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.929 
how can I create a class that will
represent<00:01:24.270> how<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.799> view<00:01:26.040> will<00:01:26.460> look<00:01:26.670> like

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
represent how the view will look like

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.410 
represent how the view will look like
okay<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.439> called<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.829> view<00:01:29.070> model<00:01:29.420> so

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
okay so that is called a view model so

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.630 
okay so that is called a view model so
if<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.630> go<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.799> just<00:01:31.829> created<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.340> view<00:01:32.490> model

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
if I go and I just created a view model

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.330 
if I go and I just created a view model
folder<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.360> I'm<00:01:33.450> going<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.780> say<00:01:34.110> add<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.009> class

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
folder and I'm going to say add a class

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.980 
folder and I'm going to say add a class
and<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:36.630> will<00:01:36.840> say<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.500> my<00:01:38.990> registration

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
and I will say this is my registration

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.510 
and I will say this is my registration
view<00:01:40.920> model

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
view model

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.600 
view model
okay<00:01:42.170> so<00:01:43.170> registration<00:01:43.680> view<00:01:43.979> model<00:01:44.369> will

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
okay so registration view model will

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.120 
okay so registration view model will
contain<00:01:45.000> all<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.360> fields<00:01:45.840> all<00:01:46.229> the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
contain all the fields all the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.730 
contain all the fields all the
attributes<00:01:47.420> that<00:01:48.420> your<00:01:48.720> registration<00:01:48.869> view

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
attributes that your registration view

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.649 
attributes that your registration view
will<00:01:49.950> require<00:01:50.369> for<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:50.970> first<00:01:51.210> thing<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.450> it

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
will require for the first thing that it

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.370 
will require for the first thing that it
will<00:01:51.810> requiring<00:01:52.229> in<00:01:52.500> what<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.979> username

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
will requiring in what is username

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.510 
will requiring in what is username
so<00:01:54.950> I'm<00:01:55.010> just<00:01:55.130> going<00:01:55.310> to<00:01:55.430> add<00:01:55.640> a<00:01:55.670> username<00:01:56.470> and

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
now this particular view model which is

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.559 
now this particular view model which is
a<00:02:16.940> registration<00:02:17.569> view<00:02:18.080> model<00:02:18.880> represents<00:02:19.880> the

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
a registration view model represents the

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.520 
a registration view model represents the
view<00:02:20.870> which<00:02:21.380> is<00:02:21.530> a<00:02:21.560> registration<00:02:22.069> view<00:02:22.480> okay

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
view which is a registration view okay

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.840 
view which is a registration view okay
now<00:02:24.530> if<00:02:24.620> you<00:02:24.739> don't<00:02:25.010> want<00:02:25.250> to<00:02:25.340> take<00:02:25.489> that<00:02:25.640> route

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
now if you don't want to take that route

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.990 
now if you don't want to take that route
you<00:02:26.239> want<00:02:26.900> to<00:02:27.319> change<00:02:27.769> your<00:02:27.980> entities<00:02:28.610> your

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
you want to change your entities your

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.479 
you want to change your entities your
user<00:02:29.300> entity<00:02:29.780> to<00:02:29.989> hold<00:02:30.319> this<00:02:30.530> reenter<00:02:30.950> value<00:02:31.280> I

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
user entity to hold this reenter value I

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.420 
user entity to hold this reenter value I
would<00:02:32.060> advise<00:02:32.480> you<00:02:32.510> to<00:02:32.959> do<00:02:33.260> to<00:02:33.739> against<00:02:34.130> that

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
would advise you to do to against that

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.059 
would advise you to do to against that
the<00:02:35.060> reason<00:02:35.480> is<00:02:35.630> that<00:02:35.930> if<00:02:36.350> you<00:02:36.500> go<00:02:36.830> that

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
the reason is that if you go that

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.520 
the reason is that if you go that
particular<00:02:37.730> route<00:02:38.090> you<00:02:38.810> will<00:02:38.930> be<00:02:39.140> adding

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
particular route you will be adding

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.070 
particular route you will be adding
different<00:02:40.100> fields<00:02:40.850> different<00:02:41.239> properties<00:02:41.690> to

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
different fields different properties to

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.320 
different fields different properties to
your<00:02:42.290> user<00:02:42.560> object<00:02:43.100> to<00:02:43.190> your<00:02:43.280> domain<00:02:43.730> object

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
your user object to your domain object

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.160 
your user object to your domain object
which<00:02:45.040> doesn't<00:02:46.040> necessarily<00:02:46.569> need<00:02:47.569> them<00:02:47.900> and

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
which doesn't necessarily need them and

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.970 
which doesn't necessarily need them and
you<00:02:48.769> will<00:02:49.160> just<00:02:49.489> overcrowd<00:02:50.209> it<00:02:50.239> with<00:02:50.989> useless

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
you will just overcrowd it with useless

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.530 
you will just overcrowd it with useless
properties<00:02:52.760> okay

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
properties okay

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.690 
properties okay
and<00:02:53.720> also<00:02:54.170> if<00:02:54.470> you're<00:02:54.650> using<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:55.489> wrong

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
and also if you're using the wrong

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.880 
and also if you're using the wrong
approach<00:02:55.760> which<00:02:56.540> is<00:02:56.780> you<00:02:57.019> are<00:02:57.319> trading<00:02:57.650> your

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
approach which is you are trading your

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.259 
approach which is you are trading your
domain<00:02:58.340> objects<00:02:58.850> has<00:02:59.540> a<00:03:00.100> to<00:03:01.100> reflect<00:03:01.579> what<00:03:02.090> is

domain objects has a to reflect what is

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.920 
domain objects has a to reflect what is
on<00:03:02.390> the<00:03:02.480> page<00:03:03.190> then<00:03:04.239> what<00:03:05.239> you're<00:03:05.390> doing<00:03:05.420> is

on the page then what you're doing is

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.840 
on the page then what you're doing is
you<00:03:06.260> are<00:03:06.730> allowing<00:03:07.730> your<00:03:08.150> view<00:03:08.660> to<00:03:09.049> control

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
the entity or the domain and you should

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.210 
the entity or the domain and you should
never<00:03:13.430> do<00:03:13.640> that<00:03:13.820> your<00:03:14.600> domain<00:03:14.900> is<00:03:15.410> the<00:03:15.920> heart

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
never do that your domain is the heart

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.130 
never do that your domain is the heart
of<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.459> application<00:03:17.060> we<00:03:17.660> should<00:03:17.840> control

a class or a model that reflects what is
on<00:03:29.120> the<00:03:29.209> view<00:03:29.480> then<00:03:30.079> you're<00:03:30.230> looking<00:03:30.560> for<00:03:30.769> a

view model that we just created

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.949 
view model that we just created
let's<00:03:32.900> call<00:03:33.109> registration<00:03:33.709> view<00:03:33.890> model<00:03:34.220> okay

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
let's call registration view model okay

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.789 
let's call registration view model okay
and<00:03:35.959> I<00:03:36.049> will<00:03:36.109> go<00:03:36.410> to<00:03:37.190> my<00:03:38.170> let's<00:03:39.170> see<00:03:39.410> where<00:03:39.650> is

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
and I will go to my let's see where is

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:45.460 
and I will go to my let's see where is
my<00:03:40.690> views<00:03:41.690> and<00:03:43.690> you'll<00:03:44.690> see<00:03:44.900> if<00:03:45.019> we<00:03:45.140> go<00:03:45.260> to<00:03:45.320> the

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
my views and you'll see if we go to the

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.319 
my views and you'll see if we go to the
index<00:03:45.799> that's<00:03:46.040> going<00:03:46.220> to<00:03:46.310> fire<00:03:46.549> this<00:03:46.730> register

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
index that's going to fire this register

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.360 
index that's going to fire this register
action<00:03:47.720> and<00:03:47.930> you<00:03:48.470> can<00:03:48.620> simply<00:03:48.950> go<00:03:49.100> to<00:03:49.130> your

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
action and you can simply go to your

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.090 
action and you can simply go to your
controller<00:03:49.820> and<00:03:50.709> registration<00:03:51.709> controller

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
controller and registration controller

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.610 
controller and registration controller
you<00:03:52.730> can<00:03:52.760> create

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.400 

you<00:03:56.310> know<00:03:56.480> you<00:03:57.480> can<00:03:57.630> create<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:57.960> register

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
you know you can create the register

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.880 
you know you can create the register
action<00:03:58.970> and<00:04:00.110> instead<00:04:01.110> of<00:04:01.170> taking<00:04:01.350> a<00:04:01.560> user

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
action and instead of taking a user

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.150 
action and instead of taking a user
object<00:04:02.190> it's<00:04:02.550> just<00:04:02.850> going<00:04:03.180> to<00:04:03.300> take<00:04:03.570> a

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
object it's just going to take a

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:12.820 
object it's just going to take a
religious<00:04:06.920> registration<00:04:07.920> view<00:04:08.790> model<00:04:11.300> okay

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
religious registration view model okay

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:23.870 
religious registration view model okay
via<00:04:13.830> model

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.640 

now<00:04:24.880> the<00:04:25.389> question<00:04:25.780> now<00:04:25.900> becomes<00:04:26.080> that<00:04:26.410> how<00:04:26.590> do

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
now the question now becomes that how do

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.839 
now the question now becomes that how do
you<00:04:26.770> transfer<00:04:27.550> from<00:04:27.759> a<00:04:27.849> view<00:04:28.270> model<00:04:28.509> to<00:04:29.440> a

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:29.849 
you transfer from a view model to a

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:33.689 
you transfer from a view model to a
domain<00:04:30.849> model<00:04:31.419> or<00:04:31.599> an<00:04:31.750> entity<00:04:32.139> okay<00:04:32.860> there<00:04:33.669> are

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699 
domain model or an entity okay there are

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:35.820 
domain model or an entity okay there are
many<00:04:33.819> different<00:04:34.330> ways<00:04:34.569> in<00:04:35.080> this<00:04:35.259> one<00:04:35.560> I'm<00:04:35.800> just

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
many different ways in this one I'm just

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.589 
many different ways in this one I'm just
going<00:04:36.190> to<00:04:36.430> say<00:04:36.789> that<00:04:37.120> after<00:04:37.449> you<00:04:37.569> have

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:37.599 
going to say that after you have

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:39.510 
going to say that after you have
validated<00:04:38.199> the<00:04:38.470> view<00:04:38.680> model<00:04:38.860> approach<00:04:39.310> I'll

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
validated the view model approach I'll

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.820 
validated the view model approach I'll
eat<00:04:39.699> up<00:04:39.940> to<00:04:40.090> the<00:04:40.210> view<00:04:40.389> model<00:04:40.539> is<00:04:40.780> valid<00:04:41.020> I'm

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
eat up to the view model is valid I'm

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.260 
eat up to the view model is valid I'm
just<00:04:42.099> going<00:04:42.220> to<00:04:42.250> say<00:04:42.370> our<00:04:42.430> validation

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
just going to say our validation

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.469 
just going to say our validation
everything<00:04:44.259> is<00:04:44.770> okay<00:04:45.310> what<00:04:46.060> you're<00:04:46.210> going<00:04:46.389> to
