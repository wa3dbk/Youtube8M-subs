00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:08.610
 what's up with people zero tv with one 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.040
 new video to destiny the lego seekers 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.269
 regime has the judges award at bric 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.290
 world won this year 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.790
 very many do not have it 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.220
 gotten low two months ago 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.250
 the such as regime in an excellent way 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.680
 and fashioned with lego bricks 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.340
 So really in detail 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.470
 went 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.869
 and yes this year was chicago too 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.279
 again the brigg world awards and there 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.529
 He has his search from regime with 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.380
 and then it became official 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.239
 also awarded the jazz award 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.290
 definitely deserves how do you see that 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.030
 because out there 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.770
 So I personally think the thing sees 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.879
 1 and I really would have something like that 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.010
 like to stand here 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.210
 I would say even rebuild me 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.940
 I honestly but I have the 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.530
 rising not yes i want to everyone 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.719
 always very interesting 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.770
 the passion the people there these things 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.690
 I do not think there are any 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.940
 instruction that turns everything upside down 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.300
 out you take a template and 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.820
 then build it as well as possible and that 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.229
 is by no means easy and it is 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.090
 are always the opinion of 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.189
 all lego is something for little kids 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.020
 and then there are the people 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.330
 say nee it is not that something 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.530
 for adults and not my okay 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.830
 Now you can see how you want me 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.390
 Personally, I think everything with it 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.979
 creativity can be promoted so 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.320
 which expresses creativity 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.330
 can bring art is and ultimately 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.189
 There's nothing childish about it now 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.659
 I can paint a picture of my children 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.640
 also paint pictures but there is also one 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.630
 Picasso I say there was now 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.329
 not childish either 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.710
 So there are really many ways 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:36.329
 to show creativity to the outside and me 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.549
 Definitely find it here again 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.920
 masterpiece of nick brig by the way 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.750
 in contrast to say if this is only 5000 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.299
 abos has and with the description finds 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.369
 her the original video to suchers directing 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.689
 and where he gets the award 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.970
 we can definitely do one 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.220
 let thumb up there because that has 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.979
 a lot of effort cost okay people 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.719
 if this video was interesting here 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.829

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.110

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.420
