really<00:03:50.410> fast<00:03:50.799> that's<00:03:51.519> the<00:03:51.760> danger<00:03:52.269> one<00:03:52.510> which

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
really fast that's the danger one which

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.170 
really fast that's the danger one which
might<00:03:52.930> force<00:03:53.290> firefighters<00:03:54.069> to<00:03:54.220> reassess<00:03:54.910> how

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
might force firefighters to reassess how

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.819 
might force firefighters to reassess how
they<00:03:55.329> battle<00:03:55.690> a<00:03:55.780> blaze<00:03:56.019> to<00:03:56.380> take<00:03:56.530> a<00:03:56.560> more

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
they battle a blaze to take a more

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.819 
they battle a blaze to take a more
defensive<00:03:57.519> approach<00:03:57.760> and<00:03:58.120> perhaps<00:03:58.810> take<00:03:59.470> less

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
defensive approach and perhaps take less

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.580 
defensive approach and perhaps take less
risk<00:04:00.010> entering<00:04:00.670> a<00:04:00.940> building<00:04:01.150> and<00:04:01.510> that<00:04:02.260> could

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
risk entering a building and that could

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.770 
risk entering a building and that could
pose<00:04:02.799> a<00:04:02.829> danger<00:04:03.160> to<00:04:03.609> anyone<00:04:04.000> it's<00:04:04.420> not<00:04:04.569> just

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
pose a danger to anyone it's not just

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.270 
pose a danger to anyone it's not just
firefighters<00:04:05.350> they're<00:04:05.590> at<00:04:05.709> risk<00:04:05.889> here<00:04:06.160> it's

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
firefighters they're at risk here it's

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.009 
firefighters they're at risk here it's
homeowners<00:04:06.760> too<00:04:07.000> it's<00:04:07.269> the<00:04:07.359> general<00:04:07.630> public

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
homeowners too it's the general public

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.110 
homeowners too it's the general public
that<00:04:08.139> has<00:04:08.319> the<00:04:08.950> house<00:04:09.130> has<00:04:09.430> to<00:04:09.459> be<00:04:09.609> consigned

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
that has the house has to be consigned

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.809 
that has the house has to be consigned
because<00:04:10.900> that<00:04:11.380> means<00:04:11.620> they're<00:04:12.340> building<00:04:12.670> like

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
because that means they're building like

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.250 
because that means they're building like
burning<00:04:13.150> a<00:04:13.209> little<00:04:13.329> bit<00:04:13.569> longer<00:04:13.780> because<00:04:14.049> it's

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
burning a little bit longer because it's

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.900 
burning a little bit longer because it's
going<00:04:14.350> to<00:04:14.470> take<00:04:14.590> me<00:04:14.739> that<00:04:14.859> much<00:04:15.069> longer<00:04:15.280> to<00:04:15.790> get

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
going to take me that much longer to get

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.629 
going to take me that much longer to get
up<00:04:16.030> that<00:04:16.209> staircase

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.099 

so<00:04:19.639> what's<00:04:20.090> being<00:04:20.299> done<00:04:20.569> well<00:04:20.780> we<00:04:20.900> checked

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109

anything that can be done to make this

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:14.140 
anything that can be done to make this
you<00:05:11.539> know<00:05:11.629> safer<00:05:12.050> not<00:05:12.770> the<00:05:13.099> beam<00:05:13.279> specifically

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
you know safer not the beam specifically

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.209 
you know safer not the beam specifically
but<00:05:14.419> some<00:05:14.779> fire<00:05:14.990> officials<00:05:15.379> say<00:05:15.439> residential

00:05:16.209 --> 00:05:16.219 
but some fire officials say residential

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:18.700 
but some fire officials say residential
sprinklers<00:05:16.460> are<00:05:17.120> a<00:05:17.150> great<00:05:17.479> safety<00:05:17.810> tool<00:05:18.139> but

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
sprinklers are a great safety tool but

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.290 
sprinklers are a great safety tool but
really<00:05:19.039> the<00:05:19.129> best<00:05:19.310> advice<00:05:19.639> for<00:05:19.699> anyone<00:05:20.089> is

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
really the best advice for anyone is

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.089 
really the best advice for anyone is
just<00:05:20.330> practice<00:05:20.990> good<00:05:21.139> fire<00:05:21.379> safety<00:05:21.740> because

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:22.099 
just practice good fire safety because

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:23.829 
just practice good fire safety because
you<00:05:22.189> know<00:05:22.279> these<00:05:22.430> beams<00:05:22.639> can<00:05:23.210> pose<00:05:23.449> a<00:05:23.479> hazard

00:05:23.829 --> 00:05:23.839 
you know these beams can pose a hazard

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:27.399 
you know these beams can pose a hazard
several<00:05:24.710> minutes<00:05:25.069> into<00:05:25.729> a<00:05:25.759> home<00:05:26.089> fire<00:05:26.419> after

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:27.409 
several minutes into a home fire after

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:28.990 
several minutes into a home fire after
the<00:05:27.529> fire<00:05:27.710> breaks<00:05:28.039> out<00:05:28.250> but<00:05:28.639> by<00:05:28.819> that<00:05:28.939> time

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
the fire breaks out but by that time

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.300 
the fire breaks out but by that time
smoke<00:05:29.719> can<00:05:30.080> be<00:05:30.110> the<00:05:30.289> real<00:05:30.500> problem<00:05:30.979> an<00:05:31.069> even

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
smoke can be the real problem an even

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.429 
smoke can be the real problem an even
