00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
real but that's not too much of a

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.610 
real but that's not too much of a
problem<00:01:58.300> because<00:01:58.660> I<00:01:58.900> don't<00:01:59.050> think<00:01:59.230> anybody

00:01:59.610 --> 00:01:59.620 
problem because I don't think anybody

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.000

we<00:02:03.070> go<00:02:03.190> that's<00:02:03.340> part<00:02:03.610> of<00:02:03.670> this<00:02:03.730> thing<00:02:03.940> on

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.339 

the<00:02:14.250> stats<00:02:14.549> say<00:02:14.849> that<00:02:15.030> it's<00:02:15.209> running<00:02:15.420> 256

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
the stats say that it's running 256

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:23.240 
the stats say that it's running 256
megabytes<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:20.090> four<00:02:21.090> gigs<00:02:21.500> storage<00:02:22.500> but<00:02:23.219> uh

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
megabytes and four gigs storage but uh

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.130 
megabytes and four gigs storage but uh
when<00:02:23.939> I<00:02:23.969> hooked<00:02:24.150> it<00:02:24.329> up<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.569> Internet<00:02:25.019> it

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
when I hooked it up to the Internet it

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.649 
when I hooked it up to the Internet it
was<00:02:25.260> actually<00:02:25.650> quite<00:02:26.400> fast<00:02:26.879> those<00:02:27.299> loading

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
was actually quite fast those loading

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:32.449 
was actually quite fast those loading
pages<00:02:27.900> in<00:02:28.290> less<00:02:28.500> than<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.799> second<00:02:29.750> so<00:02:30.750> I<00:02:31.459> think

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
pages in less than a second so I think

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.149 
pages in less than a second so I think
the<00:02:32.609> round<00:02:32.819> might<00:02:33.030> actually<00:02:33.269> be<00:02:33.739> even<00:02:34.739> higher

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159 
the round might actually be even higher

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:48.130 
the round might actually be even higher
than<00:02:35.760> what<00:02:36.450> stated<00:02:36.959> in<00:02:37.109> the<00:02:37.260> end

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.530 

another<00:02:48.860> cool<00:02:49.100> thing<00:02:49.160> is<00:02:49.790> that<00:02:49.820> it<00:02:50.150> has<00:02:50.330> the

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
another cool thing is that it has the

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.080 
another cool thing is that it has the

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.360 

one<00:02:59.960> thing<00:03:00.140> I<00:03:00.200> didn't<00:03:00.410> really<00:03:00.620> care<00:03:00.830> for<00:03:00.860> is

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
one thing I didn't really care for is

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.840 
one thing I didn't really care for is
