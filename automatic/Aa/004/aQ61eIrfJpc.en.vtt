Michael and the reason that Michael

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.810 
Michael and the reason that Michael
melero<00:03:03.840> one<00:03:04.140> in<00:03:04.440> Berlin<00:03:04.920> was<00:03:05.250> because<00:03:05.580> of<00:03:05.610> this

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
melero one in Berlin was because of this

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.100 
melero one in Berlin was because of this
quarter<00:03:06.180> pipe<00:03:06.360> that<00:03:06.510> we<00:03:06.570> have<00:03:06.690> standing

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
quarter pipe that we have standing

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.890 
quarter pipe that we have standing
behind<00:03:07.230> us<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.950> thing<00:03:08.160> is<00:03:08.190> so<00:03:08.580> steep<00:03:08.940> so<00:03:09.510> tall

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
behind us the thing is so steep so tall

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.350 
behind us the thing is so steep so tall
and<00:03:10.260> it<00:03:10.770> takes<00:03:10.980> so<00:03:11.160> much<00:03:11.310> concentration<00:03:12.090> to

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
and it takes so much concentration to

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.690 
and it takes so much concentration to
get<00:03:12.510> that<00:03:12.690> rotation<00:03:13.350> around<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:13.860> to<00:03:14.250> land<00:03:14.490> and

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
get that rotation around and to land and

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.400 
get that rotation around and to land and
that's<00:03:15.090> why<00:03:15.240> the<00:03:15.300> judges<00:03:15.630> give<00:03:15.930> a<00:03:15.960> little<00:03:16.290> bit

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
that's why the judges give a little bit

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.080 
that's why the judges give a little bit
extra<00:03:16.620> points<00:03:16.980> for<00:03:17.010> extra<00:03:17.400> course<00:03:17.610> use<00:03:17.880> and

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
extra points for extra course use and

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:27.560 
extra points for extra course use and
for<00:03:18.120> such<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:18.750> difficult<00:03:19.260> trick<00:03:26.120> after<00:03:27.120> these

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
for such a difficult trick after these

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.510 
for such a difficult trick after these
outstanding<00:03:27.990> performances<00:03:28.860> we<00:03:29.040> saw<00:03:29.220> in

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
outstanding performances we saw in

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.490 
outstanding performances we saw in
Berlin<00:03:29.940> who<00:03:30.420> could<00:03:30.660> possibly<00:03:30.840> get<00:03:31.230> to<00:03:31.410> the

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
Berlin who could possibly get to the

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.070 
Berlin who could possibly get to the
podium<00:03:31.680> here<00:03:32.040> in<00:03:32.250> Cracow<00:03:32.880> my<00:03:33.420> guess<00:03:33.720> is<00:03:33.960> it

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
podium here in Cracow my guess is it

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.650 
podium here in Cracow my guess is it
could<00:03:34.290> be<00:03:34.440> liebl<00:03:35.010> Padma<00:03:35.490> at<00:03:35.820> the<00:03:36.240> moment<00:03:36.600> he

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
could be liebl Padma at the moment he

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.780 
could be liebl Padma at the moment he
doesn't<00:03:37.110> have<00:03:37.200> a<00:03:37.230> body<00:03:37.470> varial<00:03:37.920> of<00:03:38.070> his<00:03:38.220> own<00:03:38.370> in

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
doesn't have a body varial of his own in

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.820 
doesn't have a body varial of his own in
saying<00:03:39.180> that<00:03:39.420> he<00:03:39.570> does<00:03:39.840> have<00:03:40.080> the<00:03:40.230> surfer<00:03:40.620> take

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
saying that he does have the surfer take

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.310 
saying that he does have the surfer take
off<00:03:41.010> to<00:03:41.460> tsunami<00:03:41.820> backflip<00:03:42.330> and<00:03:42.450> for<00:03:43.110> the<00:03:43.170> Li

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
off to tsunami backflip and for the Li

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.440 
off to tsunami backflip and for the Li
ball<00:03:43.380> he<00:03:44.070> is<00:03:44.130> so<00:03:44.430> unpredictable<00:03:44.880> he<00:03:45.300> could

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
ball he is so unpredictable he could

00:03:45.450 --> 00:04:01.560 
ball he is so unpredictable he could
come<00:03:45.630> out<00:03:45.660> with<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:45.930> new<00:03:46.020> trick<00:03:46.410> at<00:03:46.560> any<00:03:46.890> time

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.750 

so<00:04:02.570> in<00:04:02.750> addition<00:04:02.870> we<00:04:03.260> also<00:04:03.620> have<00:04:04.130> Remi<00:04:04.460> biz

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
so in addition we also have Remi biz

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.000 
so in addition we also have Remi biz
