00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.580
 If you move around a lot, then the stroller cane 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.860
 "Bertoni I-MOOVE" for you would be a suitable option. 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:11.860
 Why cane? 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.660
 It is a lightweight compact stroller that folds easily. 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.299
 with one hand, turning into a "cane." 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.030
 In this form, it will be easy for her to move around in public. 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.130
 transport or put in the car. 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.020
 Among the strollers "Bertoni" there are a number of strollers 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.839
 type "cane": "Sporty", "Sun", "Piccadilly", "Trip". 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:32.110
 In general, they have the same foundation as I-Move, but they can 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.210
 differ only in small nuances in design. 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.210
 Together with the unpacking of the assembly "Bertoni I-MOOVE" I 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.210
 It took about four minutes. 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.210
 We put on wheels (it turned out to be done very simply) 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.210
 lay out the design, and almost done. 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.210
 If necessary, a soft protective bumper quickly 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.530
 dressed and removed, the roof-visor is folded 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.240
 and decomposed. 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.540
 The angle of the back can be adjusted manually in 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.800
 several positions, from the position - sitting, to - lying 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.800
 provisions. 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.680
 The angle of inclination of the footboard is also regulated. 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.870
 For the full safety of the baby, five-point are provided. 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.180
 seat belts. 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.610
 With them you will not have to worry that a fidget will come out of 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.460
 strollers on the go (five-point belts, in contrast to the three-point, 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.979
 fix the whole figure of the child). 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.150
 Luggage basket plays an important role. 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.800
 This thing is just necessary for moms who themselves 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.950
 buy products. 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.110
 Carrying bags and rolling a stroller is not an option, here is a basket 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.730
 will be more than ever. 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.960
 Also here you can fold children's toys! 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.500
 There is a pocket for small accessories (perfect 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.830
 for keys and mobile phone). 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:25.830
 Wheels! 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.390
 This is one of the most important aspects of the stroller, it depends on them 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.240
 ease of movement, the ability to overcome irregularities 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.330
 roads, in general - comfort when walking with a baby. 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.810
 Front and rear wheels are double, material 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:38.810
 - plastic. 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.180
 Small wheels make the stroller more maneuverable 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.900
 easy to operate (and still inconvenient to use 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.790
 for walking in the snow). 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.630
 Floating front wheels (spinning around 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.130
 axles), provide good maneuverability, but only 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.500
 on a flat surface. 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.390
 On a bumpy road, floating wheels will only get in the way, 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.520
 clamps are provided for this. 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.690
 Fix the wheels, now they do not turn (small change, 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.940
 but it is very important). 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.369
 The stroller has a brake on the rear wheels. 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.110
 This device you will appreciate when a child 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.899
 he will learn to climb into the stroller. 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.620
 The handles are soft and very comfortable, even a long walk 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.260
 will not tire. 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.170
 In cool weather, a very useful addition will be 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.599
 cover on the legs. 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.191
 In warm weather it is better not to use the cover, since 

00:02:22.191 --> 00:02:26.090
 he lets out a little air and thereâ€™s no point in walking. 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.040
 If mom has any technical questions, 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.230
 then there is a manual with pictures on this, so the answers 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.010
 always is!
