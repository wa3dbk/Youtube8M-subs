Hey, it's Ando again from SenseiAndo.com.

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.230
Today, I want to talk about something
that really drives me nuts.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.120
I'm talking about bad side kicks. It's
like a plague. You see these everywhere.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.279
Models, actors, so-called certified
fitness instructors. All these

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.570
good-looking people with their hips
sticking out, their knee crooked,

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.650
toes pointing up, and sometimes even their thumbs up and a tongue hanging out.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.810
Look, if that sounds like you, I'm
sorry. But the good news is, I think

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.620
I can help you. Today, I've got three tips to
make your sidekick stronger,

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.260
balanced, and ultimately, better for your
body.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.100
Let's take a look.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.379
Okay. If you want to learn how to throw a
powerful sidekick,

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.719
I don't want you to listen to your
teacher. I don't even want you to listen to me.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.270
I only want you to listen to your body.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.270
Ask your body these two simple questions--

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.640
Question number one: Hey, body, do you
like it better when I swing my leg

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.060
forwards and backward, or do you like it
when I swing side to side?

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.979
I'll bet one of those feels better than
the other. Question number two:

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.779
Hey, body, do you like it better when I
stomp on my heels

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.320
or when I stomp on the sides of my feet?

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.390
In fact, don't even try that one.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.259
If your body is anything like mine and
you're not built like a jellyfish,

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.380
I'll bet your body just told you
something about throwing sidekicks.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.060
It probably just told you that your body is
built to deliver and receive pressure

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.770
and force along the joints, not across
the joints.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.020
That's the way you've been walking, and
running, jumping, and climbing your entire life.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.770
Which brings us to an interesting
discovery-- the sidekick is not actually

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.040
thrown to the side of your body.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:03.200
If you put pressure across your ankle,
across your knee, or even across your hips,

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.789
You're just asking for pain and problems.
Now, yeah, you can get away with not

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.260
turning your body if you're just hacking
away at low targets like ankles and shins

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.480
and maybe alligators, but as a general
rule, I want you to remember this--

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.569
the higher you kick, the more you have to
pivot. I'll say that again--

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.969
the higher you kick, the more you have to
pivot.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.470
Okay. Listening to our bodies, here come
three tips to throw a more powerful side kick.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.050
Tip number one: Make sure you turn your
support foot. Make sure that force is

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.410
running along your foot, not across it.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.860
On offense, it's not so easy to throw a powerful kick if you're driving in off the side of your knee or

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.800
the side of your foot. On defense,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.130
if you get jammed up because your timing is off, or they catch your foot and throw this back at you,

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.170
all that pressure coming in is going to cause you to roll your ankle or tear your knee.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.220
So, if you're going to throw a side kick, make sure you turn that support foot.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.270
That's going to give you the power to
really cause some damage. And if things

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.090
go wrong, it's going to give you the ability to absorb it and hopefully walk away and reset.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.890
Tip number two: Kick with your heel, not the blade of your foot.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.490
I know. There's lots of people out there
who will tell you go ahead and kick with

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.210
the blade of your foot. I'm just not one of them.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.000
If you're kicking with the blade of your foot and it's working for you, keep it up.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.740
But for me, when I stick the
blade of my foot onto a target,

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.430
all I feel is pressure on my ankle and my
knee. I don't want any part of that.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.140
What I prefer is to make sure my heel is digging straight into that target like throwing a spear.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.830
I can feel the alignment of my bone and
my muscle right behind that. It feels no

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.610
different than stomping on the ground.
And that's good for me and bad for the other guy.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.400
Tip number three may be the only one you
need, because if you do this one right,

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.610
both of your feet will take care of
themselves. Here's the tip--

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.650
Get your butt in line. This is what I
mean. You've got three parts to this kick--

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.380
your heel, your butt, and your torso. Try
to line those up as best as you can for

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.820
a really good side kick.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.880
Here's the wrong way to do it. Foot is up,

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.700
you're looking cool, but your butt is not
in alignment at all. Your butt is sticking out.

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.340
Why is that a problem? Well, on offense,
you're not using the biggest muscles

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.669
that you've got to deliver power. 
On defense,

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.570
if this gets crushed and pushed back into
you, all that power is going to get stuck

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.790
right here and pinch your 
ribs and your hip.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.790
That's uncomfortable and will probably
knock you off balance.

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:36.140
So, here's what I think-- aim your butt to
kick their butt. Meaning--I aim my butt

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.720
then I can kick their butt. That's probably
why I like it.

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:42.999
Because it feels like there's trash talk built
right into the technique.

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:47.579
I don't even have to open my mouth. 
I just turn, kick, enjoy.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.140
So, now you know the secret to a
powerful side kick is making that full pivot.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.400
Now there are three ways that you
can time that pivot.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.080
The first way would be to make the pivot first and then send out the kick second.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.699
The second way would be just to
pivot halfway and then while you're

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.060
finishing the kick, crank over the supporting foot.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.339
The third way is more for speed,

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:12.639
where you're just going to send that foot up as fast as you can in a straight line and

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:14.229
right at the moment of impact,

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:17.710
crank over your support foot. 
Now, they're all fine.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.469
There's a time and a place for
everything. Just make sure that at the

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:26.919
moment of impact, your body has turned
fully and this leg feels just as strong

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:32.359
as when you were swinging it or when you
were stomping the heel. If you don't do that,

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:35.589
I promise you-- one, your kick is not going
to be very strong,

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:38.860
two, you're probably going to get knocked off balance a lot more than you should,

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.649
three, you look ridiculous, especially if
your tongue is hanging out of your mouth,

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:45.249
and four, there's a good chance you're
going to end up with injuries in your

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:47.740
ankles, your knees, and your hips.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.880
So, listen to your body and let it tell
you how to throw a sidekick.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.969
Okay, that's it. If you like that tip, guess
what? I've got more coming.
