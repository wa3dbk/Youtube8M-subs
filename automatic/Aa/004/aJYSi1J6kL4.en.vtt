00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
does this mean well it means that you

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.900 
does this mean well it means that you
don't<00:00:43.860> have<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.820> use<00:00:45.059> your<00:00:45.539> home<00:00:45.960> button<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:47.280> go

back<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.239> home<00:00:48.420> screen<00:00:48.800> so<00:00:49.800> if<00:00:50.780> the<00:00:51.780> ipad<00:00:52.140> is

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
back to home screen so if the ipad is

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.500 
back to home screen so if the ipad is
getting<00:00:52.890> these<00:00:53.039> becomes<00:00:53.370> features<00:00:53.789> that

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
getting these becomes features that

means that iphone and ipod us as well is
probably<00:00:59.010> going<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.250> get<00:00:59.340> these<00:00:59.550> these<00:01:00.090> kinds

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300

probably going to get these these kinds
of<00:01:00.449> features<00:01:00.629> in<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.949> future<00:01:02.460> because<00:01:02.789> most

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
of features in the future because most

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.990

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
bad thing though is that it when you

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.479 
bad thing though is that it when you
need<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.230> use<00:02:37.319> multi<00:02:37.650> touch<00:02:37.829> you<00:02:38.310> know<00:02:38.430> you
