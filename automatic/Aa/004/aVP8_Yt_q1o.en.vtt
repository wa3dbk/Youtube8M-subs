00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
and you may want to start off by just

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.420 
and you may want to start off by just
trying<00:05:13.510> waving<00:05:14.139> without<00:05:14.889> putting<00:05:15.160> a<00:05:15.250> finger

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
trying waving without putting a finger

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.520 
trying waving without putting a finger
down<00:05:15.840> here's<00:05:16.840> where<00:05:16.960> it<00:05:17.050> gets<00:05:17.169> really<00:05:17.380> tricky

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
down here's where it gets really tricky

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.150 
down here's where it gets really tricky
because<00:05:18.490> your<00:05:18.760> arm<00:05:18.940> starts<00:05:19.419> to<00:05:19.600> wanna<00:05:19.780> move

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
because your arm starts to wanna move

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.560 
because your arm starts to wanna move
once<00:05:21.160> you<00:05:21.280> get<00:05:21.400> rid<00:05:21.520> of<00:05:21.610> that<00:05:21.699> space<00:05:22.030> or<00:05:22.270> keep

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
once you get rid of that space or keep

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.960 
once you get rid of that space or keep
your<00:05:22.750> arm<00:05:22.990> in<00:05:23.320> the<00:05:23.470> same<00:05:23.710> place<00:05:26.699> and<00:05:27.699> then<00:05:27.820> when

your arm in the same place and then when

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.719 
your arm in the same place and then when
you<00:05:28.060> feel<00:05:28.240> ready<00:05:28.419> put<00:05:29.410> a<00:05:29.440> finger<00:05:29.770> down<00:05:29.889> not

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729 
you feel ready put a finger down not

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:32.550 
you feel ready put a finger down not
pushing<00:05:31.330> down<00:05:31.449> a<00:05:31.479> string<00:05:31.810> yet<00:05:31.960> just<00:05:32.229> touching

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
pushing down a string yet just touching

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:40.439 
pushing down a string yet just touching
the<00:05:32.650> fingerboard<00:05:38.940> remember<00:05:39.940> you're<00:05:40.090> moving

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:40.449 
the fingerboard remember you're moving

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:44.370 
the fingerboard remember you're moving
parallel<00:05:40.900> to<00:05:41.590> the<00:05:41.740> fingerboard<00:05:43.050> or<00:05:44.050> to<00:05:44.229> your

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
parallel to the fingerboard or to your

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.589 
parallel to the fingerboard or to your
strings<00:05:44.710> not<00:05:45.460> side-to-side<00:05:46.590> the<00:05:47.590> parallel

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:48.599 
strings not side-to-side the parallel

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:53.659 
strings not side-to-side the parallel
see<00:05:49.599> how<00:05:49.690> I<00:05:49.750> still<00:05:50.050> have<00:05:50.169> that<00:05:50.289> space<00:05:50.500> in<00:05:50.710> there

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:55.920 

then<00:05:54.669> when<00:05:54.820> you<00:05:54.940> feel<00:05:55.090> comfortable<00:05:55.599> with<00:05:55.750> this

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
then when you feel comfortable with this

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.310 
then when you feel comfortable with this
you<00:05:56.349> can<00:05:56.530> try<00:05:56.680> pushing<00:05:57.039> down<00:05:57.340> a<00:05:57.370> string<00:05:58.320> here's

00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.320 
you can try pushing down a string here's

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.629 
you can try pushing down a string here's
the<00:05:59.530> thing<00:05:59.740> though<00:05:59.889> you<00:05:59.919> don't<00:06:00.280> need<00:06:00.400> to<00:06:00.460> push

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 
the thing though you don't need to push

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:02.010 
the thing though you don't need to push
down<00:06:00.669> your<00:06:00.910> strings<00:06:01.210> as<00:06:01.360> hard<00:06:01.570> as<00:06:01.690> you<00:06:01.810> think

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
down your strings as hard as you think

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.159 
down your strings as hard as you think
you<00:06:02.169> do<00:06:02.380> so<00:06:03.160> just<00:06:03.400> find<00:06:03.669> how<00:06:03.940> far<00:06:04.210> how<00:06:04.720> much<00:06:04.990> do

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:05.169 
you do so just find how far how much do

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:06.719 
you do so just find how far how much do
you<00:06:05.229> have<00:06:05.289> to<00:06:05.440> push<00:06:05.650> before<00:06:06.070> the<00:06:06.190> string

down<00:06:10.210> too<00:06:10.479> far<00:06:10.720> if<00:06:10.930> you<00:06:11.020> squeeze<00:06:11.349> on<00:06:11.530> it<00:06:11.680> it's

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
down too far if you squeeze on it it's

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.230 
down too far if you squeeze on it it's
gonna<00:06:11.889> be<00:06:12.070> too<00:06:12.280> hard<00:06:12.460> to<00:06:12.550> get<00:06:12.669> your<00:06:12.849> wrist<00:06:13.060> to

comfortable<00:06:23.560> with<00:06:23.919> this<00:06:24.190> and<00:06:24.970> then<00:06:25.120> we're

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240 
comfortable with this and then we're

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.310 
comfortable with this and then we're
ready<00:06:25.360> to<00:06:25.510> add<00:06:25.720> bow<00:06:27.599> adding<00:06:28.599> bow<00:06:28.750> can't<00:06:29.020> be<00:06:29.169> get

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:29.320 
ready to add bow adding bow can't be get

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.810 
ready to add bow adding bow can't be get
a<00:06:29.349> little<00:06:29.590> bit<00:06:29.740> tricky<00:06:29.979> because<00:06:30.010> we're<00:06:30.490> moving

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:30.820 
a little bit tricky because we're moving

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:32.790 
a little bit tricky because we're moving
our<00:06:31.090> left<00:06:31.330> hand<00:06:31.630> a<00:06:31.840> lot<00:06:32.050> faster<00:06:32.530> than<00:06:32.680> we're

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 
our left hand a lot faster than we're

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.950 
our left hand a lot faster than we're
moving<00:06:33.130> our<00:06:33.250> bow<00:06:33.400> so<00:06:34.150> while<00:06:34.330> you<00:06:34.479> start<00:06:34.810> and

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 
moving our bow so while you start and

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.240 
moving our bow so while you start and
get<00:06:35.050> your<00:06:35.169> vibrato<00:06:35.440> ready<00:06:35.770> to<00:06:35.889> go

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.250 
get your vibrato ready to go

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.310 
get your vibrato ready to go
you<00:06:37.150> should<00:06:37.330> be<00:06:37.419> at<00:06:37.510> a<00:06:37.539> point<00:06:37.750> where<00:06:37.990> you<00:06:38.110> can

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:38.320 
you should be at a point where you can

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.830 
you should be at a point where you can
do<00:06:38.470> vibrato<00:06:38.650> you<00:06:39.010> can<00:06:39.250> do<00:06:39.400> this<00:06:39.580> motion<00:06:39.820> for<00:06:40.270> at

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:40.840 
do vibrato you can do this motion for at

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.670 
do vibrato you can do this motion for at
least<00:06:40.990> a<00:06:41.199> minute<00:06:43.199> you<00:06:44.199> shouldn't<00:06:44.590> be

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 
least a minute you shouldn't be

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.409 
least a minute you shouldn't be
squeezing<00:06:45.010> you<00:06:45.729> should<00:06:45.880> still<00:06:46.120> have<00:06:46.150> your

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:46.419 
squeezing you should still have your

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:49.830 
squeezing you should still have your
space<00:06:47.099> hang<00:06:48.099> and<00:06:48.280> the<00:06:48.490> first<00:06:48.760> step<00:06:49.090> is<00:06:49.360> just<00:06:49.419> to

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 
space hang and the first step is just to

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.159 
space hang and the first step is just to
air<00:06:50.140> bow<00:06:51.390> usually<00:06:52.390> when<00:06:52.539> people<00:06:52.570> start<00:06:53.080> out

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:53.169 
air bow usually when people start out

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:55.320 
air bow usually when people start out
with<00:06:53.320> vibrato<00:06:53.530> they<00:06:54.520> get<00:06:54.700> this<00:06:55.000> kind

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:55.330 
with vibrato they get this kind

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:56.790 
with vibrato they get this kind
thing<00:06:55.539> where<00:06:56.139> they're<00:06:56.289> trying<00:06:56.470> to<00:06:56.500> move<00:06:56.620> the

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 
thing where they're trying to move the

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.980 
thing where they're trying to move the
bow<00:06:57.189> back<00:06:57.849> and<00:06:58.120> forth<00:06:58.330> the<00:06:58.509> same<00:06:58.539> way<00:06:58.870> that

00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:58.990 
bow back and forth the same way that

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:00.990 
bow back and forth the same way that
their<00:06:59.139> fingers<00:06:59.470> are<00:06:59.620> moving<00:06:59.650> so<00:07:00.610> you<00:07:00.699> have<00:07:00.819> to

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 
their fingers are moving so you have to

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.520 
their fingers are moving so you have to
practice<00:07:01.210> until<00:07:01.689> you<00:07:01.840> can<00:07:01.960> move<00:07:02.259> your<00:07:02.349> bow

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:02.530 
practice until you can move your bow

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:06.450 
practice until you can move your bow
very<00:07:02.860> smoothly<00:07:04.560> while<00:07:05.560> your<00:07:05.710> fingers<00:07:06.039> go<00:07:06.250> back

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:06.460 
very smoothly while your fingers go back

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.730 
very smoothly while your fingers go back
and<00:07:06.729> forth<00:07:07.199> you<00:07:08.199> also<00:07:08.349> want<00:07:08.560> to<00:07:08.590> make<00:07:08.710> sure

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:08.740 
and forth you also want to make sure

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:10.529 
and forth you also want to make sure
that<00:07:09.280> you're<00:07:09.370> not<00:07:09.460> getting<00:07:09.819> like<00:07:09.969> jerky

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:10.539 
that you're not getting like jerky

00:07:10.539 --> 00:07:13.709 
that you're not getting like jerky
motions<00:07:10.900> out<00:07:11.110> of<00:07:11.229> your<00:07:11.349> bow<00:07:11.939> it's<00:07:12.939> just<00:07:13.419> ear

00:07:13.709 --> 00:07:13.719 
motions out of your bow it's just ear

00:07:13.719 --> 00:07:20.249 
motions out of your bow it's just ear
bow<00:07:18.479> when<00:07:19.479> you<00:07:19.569> feel<00:07:19.780> really<00:07:20.080> comfortable

00:07:20.249 --> 00:07:20.259 
bow when you feel really comfortable

00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:21.779 
bow when you feel really comfortable
with<00:07:20.680> that<00:07:20.740> you're<00:07:21.129> ready<00:07:21.310> to<00:07:21.430> start<00:07:21.639> making

00:07:21.779 --> 00:07:21.789 
with that you're ready to start making

00:07:21.789 --> 00:07:24.659 
with that you're ready to start making
some<00:07:22.000> sounds<00:07:22.599> do<00:07:23.289> not<00:07:23.530> try<00:07:23.800> to<00:07:23.830> do<00:07:24.039> vibrato<00:07:24.219> too

00:07:24.659 --> 00:07:24.669 
some sounds do not try to do vibrato too

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:27.059 
some sounds do not try to do vibrato too
fast<00:07:24.969> otherwise<00:07:25.569> you'll<00:07:25.900> end<00:07:25.990> up<00:07:26.199> with<00:07:26.379> too

00:07:27.059 --> 00:07:27.069 
fast otherwise you'll end up with too

00:07:27.069 --> 00:07:28.709 
fast otherwise you'll end up with too
much<00:07:27.219> tension<00:07:27.490> in<00:07:27.729> your<00:07:27.849> hand<00:07:28.090> it<00:07:28.300> won't<00:07:28.509> sound

00:07:28.709 --> 00:07:28.719 
much tension in your hand it won't sound

00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:36.830 
much tension in your hand it won't sound
very<00:07:29.050> good<00:07:29.080> just<00:07:29.800> do<00:07:29.949> a<00:07:29.979> slow<00:07:30.370> vibrato

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:36.840 

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.140 

eventually<00:07:37.800> you<00:07:38.070> can<00:07:38.250> speed<00:07:38.490> it<00:07:38.520> up<00:07:38.730> but<00:07:39.000> only

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:39.150 
eventually you can speed it up but only

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:40.909 
eventually you can speed it up but only
when<00:07:39.540> you<00:07:39.630> feel<00:07:39.660> comfortable<00:07:40.290> moving<00:07:40.470> to<00:07:40.800> the

00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:40.919 
when you feel comfortable moving to the

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:42.920 
when you feel comfortable moving to the
next<00:07:41.100> speed<00:07:41.430> and<00:07:42.180> if<00:07:42.300> you<00:07:42.419> practice<00:07:42.600> this

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:42.930 
next speed and if you practice this

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.230 
next speed and if you practice this
every<00:07:43.260> day<00:07:43.290> you<00:07:43.950> will<00:07:44.070> be<00:07:44.220> a<00:07:44.250> vibrato<00:07:44.639> pro<00:07:45.060> in

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:45.240 
every day you will be a vibrato pro in

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.660 
every day you will be a vibrato pro in
no<00:07:45.270> time
