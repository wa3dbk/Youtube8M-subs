00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
bad to the bronze and a crease brush and

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.949 
bad to the bronze and a crease brush and
I<00:01:52.679> just<00:01:52.859> place<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.219> in<00:01:53.579> my<00:01:53.759> crease<00:01:54.149> focusing

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:57.590 
I just place that in my crease focusing
on<00:01:55.109> the<00:01:55.319> outer<00:01:55.499> corner<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.520> even<00:01:57.270> go<00:01:57.389> a<00:01:57.420> little

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
on the outer corner I even go a little

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.539 
on the outer corner I even go a little
bit<00:01:57.810> down<00:01:58.049> into<00:01:58.409> like<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.709> outer<00:01:58.859> V<00:01:59.219> place

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
bit down into like the outer V place

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:00.739 
bit down into like the outer V place
that<00:01:59.729> in<00:01:59.850> there<00:01:59.999> a<00:02:00.030> little<00:02:00.179> bit<00:02:00.389> but<00:02:00.569> just

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:00.749 
that in there a little bit but just

that in there a little bit but just
focus<00:02:01.049> it<00:02:01.200> on<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.439> crease<00:02:01.679> and<00:02:01.950> then<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.100> don't

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
focus it on the crease and then I don't

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.309 
focus it on the crease and then I don't
always<00:02:02.609> blend<00:02:03.149> too<00:02:03.509> well<00:02:03.659> because<00:02:03.929> I<00:02:04.049> go<00:02:04.170> back

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
always blend too well because I go back

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:06.019 
always blend too well because I go back
in<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.679> later<00:02:04.889> with<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.189> clean<00:02:05.579> blending<00:02:05.850> brush

in the later with a clean blending brush
and<00:02:06.270> blend<00:02:06.719> it<00:02:08.450> I'm<00:02:09.450> just<00:02:09.600> mainly<00:02:09.899> focusing<00:02:10.470> on

and blend it I'm just mainly focusing on

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.080 
and blend it I'm just mainly focusing on
getting<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.950> color<00:02:11.250> in<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.730> crease

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.150 

once<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:17.050> colors<00:02:17.349> in<00:02:17.379> the<00:02:17.590> crease<00:02:17.830> I<00:02:17.860> take<00:02:18.129> a

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
once the colors in the crease I take a

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.220 
once the colors in the crease I take a
clean<00:02:18.610> fluffy<00:02:19.000> brush<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.420> I<00:02:19.750> pick<00:02:19.989> up<00:02:20.140> a

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
clean fluffy brush and I pick up a

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.780 
clean fluffy brush and I pick up a
little<00:02:20.530> bit<00:02:20.650> of<00:02:20.739> the<00:02:20.890> color<00:02:20.920> from<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.310> Naked<00:02:21.640> 2

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
little bit of the color from the Naked 2

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.910 
little bit of the color from the Naked 2
palette<00:02:21.819> called<00:02:22.510> foxy<00:02:23.140> which<00:02:23.379> is<00:02:23.530> just<00:02:23.739> a

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
palette called foxy which is just a

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.009 
palette called foxy which is just a
light<00:02:24.459> color<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:24.879> I<00:02:25.060> use<00:02:25.269> that<00:02:25.300> to<00:02:25.569> blend<00:02:25.870> out

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
light color and I use that to blend out

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.140 
light color and I use that to blend out
my<00:02:26.230> crease<00:02:26.590> I'm<00:02:26.890> just<00:02:27.459> make<00:02:27.670> sure<00:02:27.849> that<00:02:27.879> it's

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
my crease I'm just make sure that it's

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.210 
my crease I'm just make sure that it's
not<00:02:28.330> too<00:02:28.780> harsh<00:02:28.959> of<00:02:29.110> a<00:02:29.230> line<00:02:29.440> I<00:02:29.680> think<00:02:29.709> that<00:02:30.099> the

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
not too harsh of a line I think that the

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.740 
not too harsh of a line I think that the
snake<00:02:30.430> by<00:02:30.640> color<00:02:30.849> is<00:02:30.970> really<00:02:31.269> pretty<00:02:31.450> for

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
snake by color is really pretty for

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.150 
snake by color is really pretty for
spring<00:02:32.019> and<00:02:32.230> summer<00:02:32.319> because<00:02:32.709> it's<00:02:32.890> just<00:02:32.950> like

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
spring and summer because it's just like

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.670 
spring and summer because it's just like
a<00:02:33.250> perfect<00:02:33.700> bronzy<00:02:34.180> color<00:02:34.390> then<00:02:35.379> when<00:02:35.560> I'm

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.530 
a perfect bronzy color then when I'm
done<00:02:35.709> doing<00:02:36.040> that<00:02:36.160> I<00:02:36.310> like<00:02:36.640> to<00:02:36.760> take<00:02:37.000> just<00:02:37.209> a

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540

nothing too crazy just to draw some
light<00:03:41.410> there<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:41.859> then<00:03:42.310> use<00:03:42.489> it<00:03:42.609> as<00:03:42.730> a

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
2 palette and kind of like a dense

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.280 
2 palette and kind of like a dense
crease<00:03:54.880> brush<00:03:55.090> almost<00:03:55.599> not<00:03:55.900> crease<00:03:56.139> brush

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290

as<00:03:58.389> eyeliner<00:03:58.900> I'm<00:03:59.260> definitely<00:03:59.709> a<00:04:00.069> fan<00:04:00.130> of

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
as eyeliner I'm definitely a fan of

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.970 
as eyeliner I'm definitely a fan of
liquid<00:04:00.880> liner<00:04:01.090> and<00:04:01.450> gel<00:04:02.260> liner<00:04:02.500> but<00:04:02.739> in<00:04:02.859> the

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
liquid liner and gel liner but in the

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.589 
liquid liner and gel liner but in the
summer<00:04:03.220> and<00:04:03.310> the<00:04:03.700> spring<00:04:03.970> sometimes<00:04:04.329> you<00:04:04.450> just

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
summer and the spring sometimes you just

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:06.089 
summer and the spring sometimes you just
want<00:04:04.780> something<00:04:04.959> a<00:04:05.139> little<00:04:05.319> bit<00:04:05.530> lighter<00:04:05.799> so

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
want something a little bit lighter so

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:08.699 
want something a little bit lighter so
I've<00:04:06.220> been<00:04:06.340> using<00:04:06.579> this<00:04:06.970> eyeliner<00:04:07.840> or<00:04:08.200> this

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
I've been using this eyeliner or this

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.740 
I've been using this eyeliner or this
eyeshadow<00:04:09.160> as<00:04:09.459> eyeliner<00:04:10.060> because<00:04:10.329> I<00:04:10.540> think

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
eyeshadow as eyeliner because I think

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.030 
eyeshadow as eyeliner because I think
it's<00:04:10.840> a<00:04:10.930> little<00:04:11.049> bit<00:04:11.169> more<00:04:11.410> subtle<00:04:11.680> and<00:04:11.980> you

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
it's a little bit more subtle and you

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.589 
it's a little bit more subtle and you
can<00:04:12.190> kind<00:04:12.370> of<00:04:12.549> blend<00:04:12.849> it<00:04:13.000> out<00:04:13.090> a<00:04:13.120> little<00:04:13.389> bit

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 
can kind of blend it out a little bit

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:15.780 
can kind of blend it out a little bit
better<00:04:13.840> I<00:04:14.200> also<00:04:14.620> use<00:04:14.889> it<00:04:15.010> on<00:04:15.069> the<00:04:15.220> upper<00:04:15.579> lash

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
better I also use it on the upper lash

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.670 
better I also use it on the upper lash
line<00:04:15.819> and<00:04:16.510> then<00:04:17.019> I<00:04:17.049> think<00:04:17.320> when<00:04:17.470> you<00:04:17.560> add

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
line and then I think when you add

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.409 
line and then I think when you add
mascara<00:04:18.190> it<00:04:18.340> darkens<00:04:18.760> it<00:04:18.849> up<00:04:19.000> a<00:04:19.120> little<00:04:19.269> bit

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
mascara it darkens it up a little bit

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.080 
mascara it darkens it up a little bit
but<00:04:19.870> I<00:04:20.049> go<00:04:20.500> all<00:04:20.680> the<00:04:20.829> way<00:04:20.859> all<00:04:21.519> the<00:04:21.940> way<00:04:21.970> from

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
but I go all the way all the way from

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.940 
but I go all the way all the way from
the<00:04:22.270> inner<00:04:22.419> corner<00:04:22.510> to<00:04:23.110> the<00:04:23.289> outer<00:04:23.440> corner

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
the inner corner to the outer corner

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.800 
the inner corner to the outer corner
then<00:04:24.430> I've<00:04:24.640> really<00:04:24.880> been<00:04:24.969> loving<00:04:25.120> this<00:04:25.390> super
