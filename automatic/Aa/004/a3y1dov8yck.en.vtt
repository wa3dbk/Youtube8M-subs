 CHICKEN WITH CASH OF NUTS 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.200
 Hi, there's Bo` on the road and Authentic World Food. 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.980
 We are at Khao Lak in Thailand at one of hundreds of beautiful waterfalls. 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.440
 And Thailand is not just beautiful nature, but it also has amazing cuisine 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.560
 which not only tastes great, but also super fast. 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.500
 Let's go to a small street restaurant to cook cashew chicken. 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.680
 Food that is fast, delicious and Thailand, surprisingly, non-burning. 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:47.480
 First prepare the vegetables. Green and red pepper, onion and tomato. 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.880
 Clean the wok, heat it and pour some oil into it. 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.560
 Fry chicken breast in it for 1 minute. 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:10.420
 Add the garlic and add cashew nuts, peppers, tomatoes and onions in about 20 seconds. 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.260
 Fry for about 20 seconds. 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.280
 Then add the oyster sauce that the lady has already pre-mixed with the fish sauce 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:30.840
 sugar, glutasol - if you use it and dark soy sauce. 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.640
 Stir well, pour in broth and let boil for about a minute. 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.440
 And meanwhile, we put rice on the plates. 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.760
 Just before serving, add spring onion, fresh coriander leaves and pepper. 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.840
 Mix and serve. 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.240
 So it went fast as you say;) 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.900
