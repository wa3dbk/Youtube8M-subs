00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.179
 our service is both dangerous and difficult and on 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:16.430
 first glance as if not visible if 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:20.400
 someone here and there sometimes honestly and here 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:28.349
 so with them we lead an invisible battle so 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:29.720
 appointed by fate for us all again 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.510
 Hello 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:38.579
 successful game as always here with the new 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:41.850
 base of 6 base which is not sitting not 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:47.820
 I remember where it's not Don Don where 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:52.500
 then this is the altar on which 110 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:55.680
 caught well here you see passivka bers 25 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:01.010
 Iâ€™m still trying to try a little 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:04.979
 accumulates change 49 ctivka too 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:11.400
 sweet yet she planted 5 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:14.850
 blue on the tower for as for l waves for 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.400
 I will become the bombers, that is, in general 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.280
 all this manned here 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.210
 the only thing that's planted in this tower 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.460
 this is to raise the strength which then either 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.320
 before that I will beat tell either after 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:36.689
 the essence is not in it let now about swing 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:44.299
 trivia Well, what do we try in my time? 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:44.299
 so ando here she is already come on hhh 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:50.690
 purely for the sake of principle again I want 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.610
 try to go watched videos and mine 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.120
 subscribers and on which I channel 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.770
 signed they pass there magically 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.610
 towers of course need to change probably all 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.610
 still on the small 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:12.000
 let's see what comes out of it now 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:15.140
 take the arrangement rather even sort of 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.140
 I watched her go 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.860
 put out a try 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:35.500
 so well 1 passed and he did not immediately demolished 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:45.310
 everything is not all right two towers yes 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:48.490
 it turns out even rises to 2 and me 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.600
 pro Nikita ponastavil course infix 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:55.810
 let's see now will be gone 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:58.660
 I did not expect that and so will probably 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.590
 Cupid still helps me so long ago 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.590
 started doubting 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.870
 this all want to want as though pumpkin 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.160
 They write precisely that he with a pumpkin well 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:16.350
 Okay right now, it will be clear that the cyclone in general 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:19.680
 just fire so alright fig with this 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.680
 Stream towers let's guys 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.680
 try to 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.160
 principle so I understand that only from that 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.940
 that I planted a trip to someone 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.940
 there is no business 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:43.080
 but rumors seem to be all so far alive 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:48.410
 a little bit like our 4, I understand that here 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:54.510
 just the same it will be easier like as at 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:56.730
 you will be seen settled important 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.079

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:09.230

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:12.590

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.250

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:03.600
 it worked but it doesn't matter very much 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:08.100
