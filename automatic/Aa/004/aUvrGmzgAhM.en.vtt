so<00:01:59.170> the<00:01:59.409> federal<00:01:59.740> government<00:02:00.219> stepped<00:02:00.579> in<00:02:00.759> and

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
so the federal government stepped in and

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.810 
so the federal government stepped in and
mandated<00:02:01.749> to<00:02:01.960> make<00:02:02.289> sure<00:02:02.499> that<00:02:02.799> all<00:02:03.009> the<00:02:03.520> oils

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
mandated to make sure that all the oils

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.700 
mandated to make sure that all the oils
can<00:02:03.999> be<00:02:04.119> mixed<00:02:04.359> because<00:02:04.780> when<00:02:05.020> synthetics

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
can be mixed because when synthetics

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.020 
can be mixed because when synthetics
first<00:02:05.950> came<00:02:06.159> out<00:02:06.189> they<00:02:06.579> weren't<00:02:06.700> available

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
first came out they weren't available

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.940 
first came out they weren't available

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:09.529

it

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539

particular oil is a 50-50 mixture if you

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.830 
particular oil is a 50-50 mixture if you

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
ever see any oil that actually says it

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.979 
ever see any oil that actually says it
is<00:02:42.989> a<00:02:43.019> semi<00:02:43.590> synthetic<00:02:44.129> oil<00:02:44.819> it's<00:02:45.480> actually

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
is a semi synthetic oil it's actually

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.319 
is a semi synthetic oil it's actually
just<00:02:46.200> half<00:02:46.500> regular<00:02:46.859> oil<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.489> half<00:02:47.970> full

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
just half regular oil and half full

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:49.640 
just half regular oil and half full
synthetic<00:02:48.599> so<00:02:49.049> that<00:02:49.200> makes<00:02:49.439> it<00:02:49.530> a

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
synthetic so that makes it a

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.379 
synthetic so that makes it a
semi-synthetic<00:02:50.189> and<00:02:50.669> they<00:02:50.819> are<00:02:50.939> completely

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:51.389 
semi-synthetic and they are completely

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:53.720 
semi-synthetic and they are completely
mixable<00:02:51.959> so<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.620> full<00:02:53.010> synthetic<00:02:53.280> to<00:02:53.700> a

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
mixable so a full synthetic to a

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.640 
mixable so a full synthetic to a
semi-synthetic<00:02:54.329> is<00:02:54.750> always<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.319> way<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.500> go

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
semi-synthetic is always the way to go

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.979 
semi-synthetic is always the way to go
and<00:02:56.010> again<00:02:56.609> if<00:02:56.760> you<00:02:56.849> put<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.090> full<00:02:57.329> synthetic<00:02:57.569> in

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
and again if you put a full synthetic in

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.229 
and again if you put a full synthetic in
your<00:02:58.139> bike<00:02:58.319> there<00:02:58.919> is<00:02:59.220> no<00:02:59.430> worry<00:02:59.760> about<00:03:00.090> the

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
your bike there is no worry about the

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.879 
your bike there is no worry about the
clutch<00:03:00.480> slipping<00:03:00.989> that's<00:03:01.200> not<00:03:01.590> going<00:03:01.799> to

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:01.889 
clutch slipping that's not going to

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:03.170 
clutch slipping that's not going to
happen<00:03:02.010> because<00:03:02.370> of<00:03:02.639> the<00:03:02.700> high<00:03:02.849> phosphorus

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
happen because of the high phosphorus

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.580 
happen because of the high phosphorus
count<00:03:03.750> that<00:03:03.959> they<00:03:04.079> put<00:03:04.260> in<00:03:04.379> special

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
count that they put in special

count that they put in special
motorcycle<00:03:05.310> oils<00:03:05.639> and<00:03:05.849> the<00:03:06.389> fact<00:03:06.629> that<00:03:06.780> there

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
motorcycle oils and the fact that there

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.379 
motorcycle oils and the fact that there

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:11.210 
are not the additive friction packages
like<00:03:09.540> there<00:03:09.720> is<00:03:09.810> in<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.989> car<00:03:10.200> oil<00:03:10.230> we<00:03:11.040> don't

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
like there is in the car oil we don't

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.250

up<00:03:42.239> like<00:03:42.269> a<00:03:42.419> piece<00:03:42.720> of<00:03:42.750> spring<00:03:43.199> it<00:03:43.470> actually

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
up like a piece of spring it actually

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.069 
up like a piece of spring it actually
flows<00:03:44.549> quicker<00:03:45.090> because<00:03:45.329> it's<00:03:45.629> smaller

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
flows quicker because it's smaller

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.800 
flows quicker because it's smaller
through<00:03:46.949> the<00:03:47.129> orifices<00:03:47.940> and<00:03:48.000> through<00:03:48.569> the

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
through the orifices and through the

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.409 
through the orifices and through the
system<00:03:49.019> of<00:03:49.349> the<00:03:49.500> vehicle<00:03:49.949> that<00:03:49.979> it's<00:03:50.280> in<00:03:50.489> as

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.419 
system of the vehicle that it's in as

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:54.080 
system of the vehicle that it's in as
the<00:03:51.810> heat<00:03:52.019> increases<00:03:52.349> the<00:03:52.919> thing<00:03:53.099> relaxes<00:03:53.819> and

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
the heat increases the thing relaxes and

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.679 
the heat increases the thing relaxes and
it<00:03:54.239> gets<00:03:54.389> longer<00:03:54.689> so<00:03:55.500> it<00:03:55.979> flows<00:03:56.489> thicker<00:03:57.299> so

00:03:57.679 --> 00:03:57.689 
it gets longer so it flows thicker so

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:59.869 
it gets longer so it flows thicker so
that's<00:03:57.900> what<00:03:58.199> increases<00:03:58.709> the<00:03:59.129> viscosity<00:03:59.280> of

00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 
that's what increases the viscosity of

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:02.119 
that's what increases the viscosity of
the<00:03:59.970> oil<00:04:00.090> here<00:04:00.930> in<00:04:01.109> Southern<00:04:01.379> California<00:04:01.439> we

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
the oil here in Southern California we

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.580 
the oil here in Southern California we
get<00:04:02.310> up<00:04:02.459> to<00:04:02.639> 100<00:04:03.449> hundred<00:04:03.720> and<00:04:03.930> tens<00:04:04.139> during

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
get up to 100 hundred and tens during

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.559 
get up to 100 hundred and tens during
the<00:04:04.709> summertime<00:04:05.040> so<00:04:05.729> you<00:04:05.790> definitely<00:04:06.030> want<00:04:06.299> to

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
the summertime so you definitely want to

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.710 
the summertime so you definitely want to
run<00:04:06.750> a<00:04:07.019> much<00:04:07.349> thicker<00:04:07.680> oil<00:04:07.829> like<00:04:08.310> a<00:04:08.340> 20w50<00:04:09.329> in

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
run a much thicker oil like a 20w50 in

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.679 
run a much thicker oil like a 20w50 in
the<00:04:10.379> summertime<00:04:11.069> so<00:04:11.489> that<00:04:11.729> the<00:04:11.879> oil<00:04:11.909> actually

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:12.689 
the summertime so that the oil actually

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:15.920 
the summertime so that the oil actually
maintains<00:04:13.319> its<00:04:13.939> self<00:04:14.939> on<00:04:15.120> the<00:04:15.269> cylinder<00:04:15.599> walls
