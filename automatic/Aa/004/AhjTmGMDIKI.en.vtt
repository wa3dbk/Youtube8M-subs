but now you can stack it um so this is a
very<00:00:31.609> easy<00:00:31.730> tutorial<00:00:32.569> and<00:00:33.079> I<00:00:34.039> will<00:00:34.190> prove<00:00:34.339> it

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
very easy tutorial and I will prove it

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.790 
very easy tutorial and I will prove it
by<00:00:34.670> opening<00:00:35.030> it<00:00:35.149> and<00:00:35.300> it's<00:00:35.690> only<00:00:35.870> got<00:00:36.109> three

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
by opening it and it's only got three

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.879 
by opening it and it's only got three
dot<00:00:37.129> class<00:00:37.429> files<00:00:37.839> but<00:00:38.839> then<00:00:39.109> again<00:00:39.260> you<00:00:39.409> still

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:39.889 
dot class files but then again you still

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:41.770 
dot class files but then again you still
do<00:00:40.100> need<00:00:40.309> the<00:00:40.339> modloader<00:00:40.850> that's<00:00:41.449> the<00:00:41.600> only

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
do need the modloader that's the only

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.689 
do need the modloader that's the only
thing<00:00:41.960> I<00:00:42.260> guess<00:00:42.589> that<00:00:42.769> a<00:00:42.920> little<00:00:43.280> challenging

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:43.699 
thing I guess that a little challenging

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:46.989 
thing I guess that a little challenging
but<00:00:43.760> it's<00:00:44.449> not<00:00:44.600> challenging<00:00:44.780> at<00:00:45.079> all<00:00:45.199> so<00:00:45.999> first

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:46.999 
but it's not challenging at all so first

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:49.779 
but it's not challenging at all so first
we're<00:00:47.209> going<00:00:47.329> to<00:00:47.389> go<00:00:47.569> to<00:00:48.049> is<00:00:48.350> luckily<00:00:49.339> they<00:00:49.699> are

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
we're going to go to is luckily they are

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.109 
we're going to go to is luckily they are
both<00:00:49.940> on<00:00:50.209> the<00:00:50.329> same<00:00:50.359> exact<00:00:51.109> page<00:00:51.909> I'll<00:00:52.909> have<00:00:53.089> a

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:53.119 
both on the same exact page I'll have a

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:55.090 
both on the same exact page I'll have a
link<00:00:53.329> in<00:00:53.479> the<00:00:53.539> description<00:00:53.929> below<00:00:54.049> you<00:00:54.920> need

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
link in the description below you need

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.279 
link in the description below you need
the<00:00:55.219> modloader<00:00:55.670> and<00:00:56.179> slower<00:00:56.659> down<00:00:56.929> and<00:00:56.989> is

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
the modloader and slower down and is

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:59.559 
the modloader and slower down and is
much<00:00:57.499> more<00:00:57.889> stackables<00:00:58.519> now<00:00:59.179> the<00:00:59.329> only<00:00:59.479> thing

00:00:59.559 --> 00:00:59.569 
much more stackables now the only thing

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:02.079 
much more stackables now the only thing
that<00:01:00.139> happened<00:01:00.319> when<00:01:00.889> that<00:01:01.069> little<00:01:01.729> is<00:01:02.059> that

download direct which works fine so
either<00:01:33.320> or<00:01:33.590> just<00:01:33.890> try<00:01:34.280> both<00:01:34.520> if<00:01:34.820> one<00:01:35.240> of<00:01:35.329> them

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
either or just try both if one of them

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.149 
either or just try both if one of them
does<00:01:35.509> it<00:01:35.600> work<00:01:35.780> and<00:01:36.020> then<00:01:36.740> you<00:01:36.829> also<00:01:36.950> need

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
does it work and then you also need

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.249 
does it work and then you also need
modloader<00:01:37.369> so<00:01:38.210> download<00:01:39.049> both<00:01:39.350> of<00:01:39.380> these<00:01:39.619> ok

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
modloader so download both of these ok

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.620 
modloader so download both of these ok
so<00:01:42.340> once<00:01:43.340> you're<00:01:43.520> done<00:01:43.729> downloading<00:01:44.060> both<00:01:44.450> of

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
so once you're done downloading both of

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.469 
so once you're done downloading both of
them<00:01:44.799> put<00:01:45.799> say<00:01:46.310> that<00:01:46.460> save<00:01:47.030> them<00:01:47.179> both<00:01:47.299> to

justify<00:01:47.899> up<00:01:48.049> my<00:01:48.289> mo<00:01:48.439> more<00:01:48.829> stackables<00:01:49.490> here

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
justify up my mo more stackables here

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.230 
justify up my mo more stackables here
and<00:01:50.020> I've<00:01:51.020> got<00:01:51.469> my<00:01:51.619> modloader<00:01:52.039> here<00:01:52.609> and<00:01:53.179> i

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
and I've got my modloader here and i

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.760 
and I've got my modloader here and i
also<00:01:53.479> installed<00:01:53.719> to<00:01:54.020> me<00:01:54.140> item<00:01:54.469> so<00:01:54.740> that

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
also installed to me item so that

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.399 
also installed to me item so that
obviously<00:01:55.280> i<00:01:55.789> can<00:01:56.030> get<00:01:56.240> it<00:01:56.359> right<00:01:56.479> away<00:01:56.569> so

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
obviously i can get it right away so

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.440 
obviously i can get it right away so
