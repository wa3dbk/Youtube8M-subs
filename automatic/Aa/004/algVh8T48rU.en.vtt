00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:07.850
 Hello everyone 

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:14.930
 The World Rubber Market is also a lesson . 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:15.889
 I would like to introduce two types of development from receive in terms of the development of bag table software 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.140
 I will 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.720
 so 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:25.580
 This time I received back back but 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:29.210
 We will introduce two developments from aggressive receive 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:32.689
 Is an introduction video of the technology of the major software 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:38.690
 As there are very few top players of table software now 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:39.720
 I think that it may be helpful because there are few things that are explained in that kind of part 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:45.330
 I will 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:50.160
 I'm using it for this softback and I'm worried about how I should fight 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:55.230
 Those who are worried about who they are and what kind of receive technology they have 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:57.350
 I would like to attack more aggressively, but I have been practicing that but I have to go well 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:04.009
 Those who have such troubles 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:06.020
 In this way, deployment from before back to before receive back 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:09.960
 I think that is Do not want to 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.990
 First of all, two types of development 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.110
 I think that would like to introduce from the receive method 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.140
 The first First 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.740
 It will be a Chiquita Even with this software 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:25.310
 The Chiquita 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:29.630
 Players to take advantage has been increasing quite just that 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.710
 By firmly Chiquita also to remember not just attack flick and bought I mean 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.140
 For example 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:41.630
 It 's difficult to lift a flick when it's broken, though. 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:43.220
 By all means in the even become such a the rotation measures because the rise in the fairly simple it was Chiquita 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.330
 The table software players also 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.950
 I think that I want to finish the Chiquita 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.800
 I will 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.270
 Another receive is 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:54.979
 Become a flick 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:57.570
 I think this is no longer necessary to explain, but I put it flat and hit it 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:02.330
 It becomes the reception of the image 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:06.350
 Then I will explain the development from the person of Chiquita 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:11.570
 If you heard that even the major software 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:15.860
 You can be the rotation took Chiquita course takes the rotation of the table software 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:17.390
 Where she can is Dechotto of there is that cheap rubber takes hard rubber 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.690
 I'm there is a 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.319
 Rotation of the extent to which Well there Well if multiplied firmly 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.099
 Especially the tension rubber now 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:30.540
 I think that it is easy to take turns in the situation that is going 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:35.280
 I'd effective to say development from Chiquita because 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.540
 The expansion of the Chiquita is that a side turn comes in the returned ball for a while and comes back 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.620
 There are many 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:44.370
 But that side class is rather 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:47.640
 It is almost always returned to the back than the fore 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:52.379
 First of all , about eighty percent physically 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:56.530
 But I think that I think we come to the back side, but say a sphere that contains the lateral rotation 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:57.250
 The other because quite difficult Tteyuu depression Te Pan Table software 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.750
 Ah ah ah 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.500
 With the breath that it will come back to the back, I plunge around and sell the Dawn 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.280
 End up 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:12.100
 In the case of from Chiquita , turn around to the fore to aim 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:19.600
 I think a good idea to make the deployment in the image 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:25.180
 In the case of flicks, it's pan and play so a fast ball goes on 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:29.740
 Because tend to be obedient ball Henkyu of feeling I mean path Pa' even in fast pitch the other party 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:32.120
 It is very often because you can not put in a side turn like a chikita 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:35.420
 The course is a little limited 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:38.760
 It will be hard to receive 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:43.290
 However, table software is fast 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:47.530
 Because expansion of the pitch was flick it is possible to bring 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.380
 Please go back soon and do an image with a smile for fast deployment 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.830
 so 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:56.180
 After the big, the other party also 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:04:02.420
 Desperately case of the in Tteyuu the next four-ball eyes quite often has to catch up both 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:03.500
 It is good to practice the fourth ball with an image that aims at the fourth ball for a bill of taste while doing a hand street 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.270
 I think 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.370
 Either put it on the forehead and put it on the forehead by shaking it. 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.970
 I 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:17.310
 Like shaking the other party 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:19.320
 If it is the front team haste, it will be developed using speeding up the pitch already 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.410
 It is recommended that you go to do 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:27.890
 So here are two types of receive before this back 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.890
 Please see the development from aggressive receive 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.620
 You have 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.620
 Hmm 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:21.830
 I'm waiting 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.830
 Is not 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.690
 Hmm 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.840
 Hmm 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.840
 2
