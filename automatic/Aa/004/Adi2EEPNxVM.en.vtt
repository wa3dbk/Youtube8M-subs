00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.110
 6 tomatoes 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.429
 I took them because I was small 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.000
 one red onion 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.920
 2 cloves of garlic also took a bit 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.310
 more because i had small 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.470
 one chili spicy 2 tablespoons 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.529
 tomato paste 2 tablespoons 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.929
 balsamic vinegar and a half tablespoons 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.360
 2 tablespoons butter 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:39.930
 vegetable salt pepper to taste 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:43.200
 proceed to cooking I will cut 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.710
 now we need to cut onion tomatoes and 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:51.989
 pepper into large pieces 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:54.329
 if the tomatoes are small you can absolutely them 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:59.570
 do not cut if this example is quite small 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.570
 if this happiness is larger by 4 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.210
 cut out the middle so they do not interfere 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.610
 there is not much and small so that they 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.770
 broke up 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.280
 they will be in our oven I remind you that 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.200
 oven you reheat 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.840
 before cooking the oven must be 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.850
 already warmed up 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:28.880
 you will send tomatoes 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:32.009
 with onions and peppers in the oven for half an hour and 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.820
 there will have to languish 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:38.220
 they will not have to fry no no 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.990
 think they will be fresh just 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:47.909
 slightly with each other by connecting Celsius 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:51.110
 the smell is why it turns out very 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.020
 delicious because they prepare foil and 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.330
 together 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:03.319
 unite smells and so they 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:06.319
 get fresh almost no 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:06.319
 tired 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.090

 so that nothing is left from the bowl and his 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:43.639
 no need to fold paper 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.669

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:22.740
 so our vegetables cooked baked I 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:47.889
 added another raw red onion 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:51.219
 not so much more like you can score 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:54.300
 they cool a little but hot 

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:54.300
 menu here to work 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:06:02.260

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:07.240

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:13.510

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:13.510

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:37.620
 do not bring to a state of mashed potatoes 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:51.370
