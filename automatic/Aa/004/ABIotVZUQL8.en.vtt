00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
5v5 66 game to a 99 because i'm playing

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.219 
5v5 66 game to a 99 because i'm playing
with<00:01:56.369> almost<00:01:56.790> half<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.360> normal<00:01:57.540> players<00:01:57.840> here

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
with almost half the normal players here

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.319

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329

and to be honest the entire time on
running<00:02:00.570> around<00:02:00.869> i'm<00:02:01.369> wondering<00:02:02.369> if<00:02:02.430> i<00:02:02.549> should

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:08.729 
really really slow I don't know why I

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:12.379 
really really slow I don't know why I
move<00:04:09.000> so<00:04:09.209> slow<00:04:10.609> it's<00:04:11.609> hard<00:04:11.760> to<00:04:11.819> be<00:04:11.909> accurate<00:04:12.060> on

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
move so slow it's hard to be accurate on

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:14.420 
move so slow it's hard to be accurate on
console<00:04:12.930> easy<00:04:13.409> to<00:04:13.590> be<00:04:13.709> accurate<00:04:13.829> here<00:04:14.250> but

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
console easy to be accurate here but

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.860 
console easy to be accurate here but
like<00:04:14.519> look<00:04:14.639> how<00:04:14.790> slow<00:04:15.060> the<00:04:15.209> mouse<00:04:15.389> is<00:04:15.419> moving

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
like look how slow the mouse is moving

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.990 
like look how slow the mouse is moving
across<00:04:15.959> the<00:04:16.169> screen<00:04:16.470> like<00:04:16.680> I'm<00:04:16.799> pushing<00:04:17.039> like

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
across the screen like I'm pushing like

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.789 
across the screen like I'm pushing like
my<00:04:18.180> entire<00:04:18.269> length<00:04:18.750> across<00:04:19.019> my<00:04:19.289> mouse<00:04:19.469> kinda

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
my entire length across my mouse kinda

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.170 
my entire length across my mouse kinda
have<00:04:19.889> no<00:04:20.070> idea<00:04:20.310> why<00:04:20.430> it's<00:04:20.549> moving<00:04:20.820> so<00:04:20.969> slow

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
have no idea why it's moving so slow

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.750 
have no idea why it's moving so slow

because<00:06:33.850> this<00:06:34.450> is<00:06:34.600> the<00:06:34.660> kind<00:06:34.810> of<00:06:34.870> stuff<00:06:34.990> that

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:35.140 
because this is the kind of stuff that

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.440 
because this is the kind of stuff that
basically<00:06:36.100> this<00:06:36.430> is<00:06:36.490> what<00:06:36.580> happens<00:06:36.940> on<00:06:37.030> PC

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:37.450 
basically this is what happens on PC

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:38.850 
basically this is what happens on PC
this<00:06:37.660> is<00:06:37.750> what<00:06:37.900> the<00:06:37.990> mouse<00:06:38.140> and<00:06:38.170> keyboard<00:06:38.470> let

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:38.860 
this is what the mouse and keyboard let

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.970 
this is what the mouse and keyboard let
somebody<00:06:39.070> do<00:06:40.470> people<00:06:41.470> that<00:06:41.560> are<00:06:41.650> very<00:06:41.830> very

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:41.980 
somebody do people that are very very

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.440 
somebody do people that are very very
good<00:06:42.130> at<00:06:42.250> the<00:06:42.310> mouse<00:06:42.460> and<00:06:42.670> keyboard<00:06:42.790> I<00:06:43.240> think

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:43.450 
good at the mouse and keyboard I think

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:47.220 
good at the mouse and keyboard I think
there's<00:06:43.630> a<00:06:43.690> much<00:06:43.960> greater<00:06:44.430> potential<00:06:45.430> to<00:06:46.230> have

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:47.230 
there's a much greater potential to have

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:48.990 
there's a much greater potential to have
a<00:06:47.290> bigger<00:06:47.680> skill<00:06:48.190> differential<00:06:48.670> between<00:06:48.760> the

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:49.000 
a bigger skill differential between the

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.450 
a bigger skill differential between the
good<00:06:49.180> players<00:06:49.450> and<00:06:49.600> okay<00:06:50.170> players<00:06:50.460> versus

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.460 
good players and okay players versus

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:52.710 
good players and okay players versus
console<00:06:51.910> i<00:06:51.970> think<00:06:52.120> the<00:06:52.210> controller<00:06:52.510> like<00:06:52.660> i

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 
console i think the controller like i

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.940 
console i think the controller like i
said<00:06:52.870> in<00:06:52.960> itself<00:06:53.200> is<00:06:53.410> a<00:06:53.440> bit<00:06:53.590> of<00:06:53.680> a<00:06:53.740> skill

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:53.950 
said in itself is a bit of a skill

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.860 
said in itself is a bit of a skill
equalizer<00:06:54.310> and<00:06:54.760> if<00:06:55.330> this<00:06:55.450> is<00:06:55.570> the<00:06:55.600> kind<00:06:55.810> of

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:55.870 
equalizer and if this is the kind of

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.510 
equalizer and if this is the kind of
stuff<00:06:55.960> that<00:06:56.080> happens<00:06:56.560> that<00:06:56.650> might<00:06:56.950> be<00:06:57.130> some<00:06:57.400> of

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 
stuff that happens that might be some of

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.490 
stuff that happens that might be some of
the<00:06:57.610> thought<00:06:57.820> behind<00:06:58.000> making<00:06:58.510> larger<00:06:59.110> servers

00:06:59.490 --> 00:06:59.500 
the thought behind making larger servers

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.740 
the thought behind making larger servers
in<00:06:59.710> general<00:07:00.070> to<00:07:00.640> minimize<00:07:01.120> the<00:07:01.330> effects<00:07:01.600> of

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:01.750 
in general to minimize the effects of

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.050 
in general to minimize the effects of
better<00:07:01.960> players<00:07:02.370> so<00:07:03.370> just<00:07:03.820> one<00:07:03.910> of<00:07:03.970> my

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:04.060 
better players so just one of my

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.780 
better players so just one of my
thoughts<00:07:04.260> but<00:07:05.260> anyway<00:07:05.860> yeah<00:07:06.310> they<00:07:06.490> were<00:07:06.580> cheap

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:06.790 
thoughts but anyway yeah they were cheap

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:08.730 
thoughts but anyway yeah they were cheap
killstreaks<00:07:07.360> but<00:07:07.720> it's<00:07:07.840> a<00:07:07.900> lot<00:07:08.020> of<00:07:08.080> fun<00:07:08.320> just

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:08.740 
killstreaks but it's a lot of fun just

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.750 
killstreaks but it's a lot of fun just
laying<00:07:09.610> it<00:07:09.700> down<00:07:09.730> so<00:07:10.240> as<00:07:11.100> usual<00:07:12.100> learn<00:07:12.730> what

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:12.760 
laying it down so as usual learn what

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.390 
laying it down so as usual learn what
you<00:07:12.910> guys<00:07:13.060> think<00:07:13.330> and<00:07:14.100> see<00:07:15.100> you<00:07:15.160> guys<00:07:15.250> next
