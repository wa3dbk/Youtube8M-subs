the deepest indentations here which are

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:10.009 
the deepest indentations here which are
probably<00:02:05.479> on<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.750> order<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:08.690> maybe<00:02:09.690> two

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
probably on the order of maybe two

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:14.949 
probably on the order of maybe two
inches<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.860> an<00:02:10.920> amp<00:02:11.099> inches<00:02:12.769> off<00:02:13.769> a<00:02:14.040> pavement

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
inches to an amp inches off a pavement

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.509 
inches to an amp inches off a pavement
but<00:02:15.959> nothing<00:02:16.379> that<00:02:16.410> you<00:02:16.829> would<00:02:17.010> expect<00:02:17.400> to

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
but nothing that you would expect to

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.880 
but nothing that you would expect to
cause<00:02:17.849> the<00:02:18.120> kind<00:02:18.299> of<00:02:18.480> grinding<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.410> clanging

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
cause the kind of grinding and clanging

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.390 
cause the kind of grinding and clanging
in<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:21.209> front<00:02:21.450> end<00:02:21.629> of<00:02:21.720> this<00:02:21.840> motorcycle<00:02:22.400> this

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
in the front end of this motorcycle this

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.520 
in the front end of this motorcycle this
is<00:02:23.579> very<00:02:23.819> typical<00:02:24.090> it<00:02:24.810> will<00:02:24.989> make<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.290> same

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
is very typical it will make the same

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.340 
is very typical it will make the same
kind<00:02:25.799> of<00:02:25.860> noise<00:02:26.069> going<00:02:26.099> over<00:02:26.840> some<00:02:27.840> manhole

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
kind of noise going over some manhole

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.490 
kind of noise going over some manhole
covers<00:02:28.799> or<00:02:29.180> any<00:02:30.180> imperfection<00:02:31.019> in<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.230> road

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
covers or any imperfection in the road

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.069 
covers or any imperfection in the road
like<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:32.160> ones<00:02:32.370> we've<00:02:32.549> got<00:02:32.730> here<00:02:33.120> so<00:02:33.900> these

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
like the ones we've got here so these

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.890 
like the ones we've got here so these
are<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.440> bumps<00:02:35.040> I<00:02:35.130> just<00:02:35.340> went<00:02:35.519> over<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:36.030> I

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
are the bumps I just went over and I

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.750 
are the bumps I just went over and I
think<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.350> foot<00:02:37.590> video<00:02:37.920> picked<00:02:38.250> it<00:02:38.370> up<00:02:38.459> pretty

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
think the foot video picked it up pretty

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.360 
think the foot video picked it up pretty
well<00:02:39.230> so<00:02:40.230> I<00:02:40.260> you<00:02:40.680> know<00:02:40.739> you<00:02:40.859> judge<00:02:41.130> for

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
well so I you know you judge for

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.099 
well so I you know you judge for
yourself<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:41.970> think<00:02:42.420> there's<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:42.599> big<00:02:42.750> problem

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.109 
yourself I think there's a big problem

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:45.980 
yourself I think there's a big problem
with<00:02:43.200> this<00:02:43.290> motorcycle
