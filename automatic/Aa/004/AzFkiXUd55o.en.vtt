today I'm going to be showing you how to

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.810 
today I'm going to be showing you how to
cut<00:00:06.569> down<00:00:06.779> a<00:00:07.140> tree<00:00:07.259> in<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:08.040> forest<00:00:08.309> I<00:00:08.550> know<00:00:08.610> it

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
cut down a tree in the forest I know it

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.959 
cut down a tree in the forest I know it
can<00:00:08.940> be<00:00:08.970> a<00:00:09.090> little<00:00:09.269> bit<00:00:09.450> tricky<00:00:09.929> so<00:00:10.679> first<00:00:11.490> off

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
can be a little bit tricky so first off

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.609 
can be a little bit tricky so first off
what<00:00:12.480> you're<00:00:12.630> gonna<00:00:12.780> need<00:00:13.019> is<00:00:13.290> this<00:00:14.250> axe<00:00:14.910> and

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:15.619 
what you're gonna need is this axe and

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:17.960 
what you're gonna need is this axe and
then<00:00:16.619> another<00:00:17.100> thing<00:00:17.460> that<00:00:17.670> you're<00:00:17.760> gonna

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
then another thing that you're gonna

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.490 
then another thing that you're gonna
need<00:00:18.210> is<00:00:19.220> first<00:00:20.220> you<00:00:20.369> need<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.640> eat<00:00:20.910> so<00:00:21.840> then<00:00:22.050> on

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
need is first you need to eat so then on

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.330 
need is first you need to eat so then on
the<00:00:22.830> bottom<00:00:23.220> right<00:00:23.760> you<00:00:24.510> see<00:00:24.539> your<00:00:25.080> hunger<00:00:26.039> and

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
the bottom right you see your hunger and

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.200 
the bottom right you see your hunger and
then<00:00:27.300> right<00:00:27.599> next<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.260> stomach<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.550> blue

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
then right next to the stomach is a blue

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.420 
then right next to the stomach is a blue
bar<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:31.920> blue<00:00:32.219> bar<00:00:32.660> is<00:00:33.660> your<00:00:33.960> energy<00:00:34.440> and

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
bar and this blue bar is your energy and

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.180 
bar and this blue bar is your energy and
if<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.180> don't<00:00:36.510> have<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.899> much<00:00:37.110> energy<00:00:37.320> then

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
if you don't have that much energy then

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.069 
if you don't have that much energy then
you<00:00:38.219> won't<00:00:38.730> have<00:00:38.820> enough<00:00:39.270> energy<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.719> chop

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
you won't have enough energy to chop

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.850 
you won't have enough energy to chop
down<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.320> tree<00:00:40.640> so<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.700> can<00:00:42.210> either<00:00:42.450> eat<00:00:42.930> on<00:00:43.530> the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
down a tree so you can either eat on the

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.369 
down a tree so you can either eat on the
plane<00:00:43.980> when<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.610> first<00:00:44.789> get<00:00:44.969> off<00:00:45.120> twice<00:00:45.450> but

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
plane when you first get off twice but

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.459 
plane when you first get off twice but
if<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.770> have<00:00:47.100> everything<00:00:47.399> off<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.480> plane<00:00:48.750> you

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
if you have everything off the plane you

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.459 
if you have everything off the plane you
can<00:00:49.680> go<00:00:49.980> into<00:00:50.129> your<00:00:50.489> inventory<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:51.480> then<00:00:52.260> when

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
can go into your inventory and then when

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.860 
can go into your inventory and then when
you<00:00:52.590> pick<00:00:52.770> up<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:53.070> soda<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:54.030> refills<00:00:54.600> your

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
you pick up a soda it refills your

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.799 
you pick up a soda it refills your
energy<00:00:55.350> all<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.699> way<00:00:57.260> so<00:00:59.270> to<00:01:00.270> cut<00:01:00.480> down<00:01:00.660> the

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
energy all the way so to cut down the

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.920 
energy all the way so to cut down the
tree<00:01:01.050> it's<00:01:01.829> pretty<00:01:02.129> simple<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:03.420> go<00:01:03.570> up<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.899> a

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
tree it's pretty simple you go up to a

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.840 
tree it's pretty simple you go up to a
tree<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.379> then<00:01:05.159> you

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
tree and then you

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
tree and then you
left<00:01:07.570> click<00:01:07.810> on<00:01:08.320> it<00:01:08.830> and<00:01:08.980> then<00:01:09.640> wood<00:01:10.600> chips

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:10.870 
left click on it and then wood chips

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.890 
left click on it and then wood chips
should<00:01:11.140> fly<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:13.090> doesn't<00:01:13.510> always<00:01:13.720> happen

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
should fly this doesn't always happen

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.130 
should fly this doesn't always happen
right<00:01:14.380> away<00:01:14.620> you<00:01:14.800> have<00:01:14.950> to<00:01:15.010> UM<00:01:15.810> work<00:01:16.810> it<00:01:17.050> a

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
right away you have to UM work it a

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.050 
right away you have to UM work it a
little<00:01:17.320> bit<00:01:17.470> but<00:01:17.770> if<00:01:18.070> it<00:01:18.310> doesn't<00:01:18.520> keep

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
little bit but if it doesn't keep

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.450 
little bit but if it doesn't keep
cutting<00:01:19.480> like<00:01:20.140> in<00:01:20.320> the<00:01:20.440> same<00:01:20.620> spot<00:01:20.950> just<00:01:21.220> move

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
cutting like in the same spot just move

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.370 
cutting like in the same spot just move
a<00:01:21.580> little<00:01:21.730> bit<00:01:21.970> and<00:01:22.180> then<00:01:22.960> it<00:01:23.080> will<00:01:23.170> start

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
a little bit and then it will start

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.170 
a little bit and then it will start
cutting<00:01:23.740> like<00:01:24.640> that<00:01:24.880> and<00:01:25.600> then<00:01:26.140> a<00:01:26.350> tree<00:01:27.180> a

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
cutting like that and then a tree a

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.570 
cutting like that and then a tree a
certain<00:01:28.660> way<00:01:28.870> if<00:01:29.170> you<00:01:29.350> stand<00:01:29.710> there<00:01:29.979> and<00:01:30.190> then

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
certain way if you stand there and then

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.400 
certain way if you stand there and then
if<00:01:31.360> you<00:01:31.840> can<00:01:32.050> um<00:01:32.460> yeah<00:01:33.460> just<00:01:33.490> push<00:01:33.970> it<00:01:34.120> and<00:01:34.660> then

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
if you can um yeah just push it and then

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.640 
if you can um yeah just push it and then
boom<00:01:35.979> you<00:01:36.400> have<00:01:36.580> a<00:01:36.640> tree<00:01:36.970> trees<00:01:37.840> usually<00:01:38.229> give

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
boom you have a tree trees usually give

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.180 
boom you have a tree trees usually give
you<00:01:38.680> four<00:01:39.160> logs<00:01:39.460> you<00:01:40.030> can<00:01:40.330> pick<00:01:41.020> up<00:01:41.050> two<00:01:41.920> logs

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
you four logs you can pick up two logs

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:51.180 
you four logs you can pick up two logs
at<00:01:42.460> a<00:01:42.490> time<00:01:42.759> and<00:01:45.900> right<00:01:46.900> here<00:01:47.200> we<00:01:47.350> have<00:01:49.950> if<00:01:50.950> you

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
at a time and right here we have if you

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.390 
at a time and right here we have if you
cut<00:01:51.490> down<00:01:51.520> oh<00:01:52.119> and<00:01:53.110> another<00:01:53.350> thing<00:01:53.619> if<00:01:54.070> you

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
cut down oh and another thing if you

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.370 
cut down oh and another thing if you
chop<00:01:55.030> it<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:55.360> first<00:01:55.570> time<00:01:55.780> you'll<00:01:56.110> see<00:01:56.350> a

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
chop it the first time you'll see a

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.650 
chop it the first time you'll see a
little<00:01:56.680> texture<00:01:57.070> mess-up<00:01:57.670> and<00:01:57.820> that<00:01:58.450> means

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
little texture mess-up and that means

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.770 
little texture mess-up and that means
you're<00:01:58.869> chopping<00:01:59.200> it<00:02:00.000> see<00:02:01.000> I'll<00:02:01.270> chop<00:02:01.600> down

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
you're chopping it see I'll chop down

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.990 
you're chopping it see I'll chop down
this<00:02:02.470> little<00:02:02.830> tree<00:02:03.160> real<00:02:03.520> quick

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
this little tree real quick

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.460 
this little tree real quick
and<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:05.710> I<00:02:06.070> don't<00:02:06.759> think<00:02:07.030> it<00:02:07.210> depends<00:02:07.690> on<00:02:08.020> the

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
and it I don't think it depends on the

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.229 
and it I don't think it depends on the
size<00:02:08.709> of<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:08.979> tree<00:02:09.220> actually<00:02:09.610> I<00:02:09.880> think<00:02:10.119> it

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
size of the tree actually I think it

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.470 
size of the tree actually I think it
does<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:11.470> how<00:02:11.680> long<00:02:11.890> it<00:02:12.100> takes<00:02:12.400> a<00:02:12.700> bit<00:02:12.940> to<00:02:13.120> chop

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
does of how long it takes a bit to chop

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.900 
does of how long it takes a bit to chop
down

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.910 

you<00:02:18.270> can<00:02:18.510> try<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.810> push<00:02:19.110> this<00:02:19.290> one<00:02:19.500> but<00:02:19.770> it's

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
you can try to push this one but it's

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.190 
you can try to push this one but it's
already<00:02:20.250> falling<00:02:20.490> off<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.910> stuff<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.810> the

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
already falling off the stuff and the

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.570 
already falling off the stuff and the
little<00:02:22.470> trees<00:02:22.710> give<00:02:23.070> you<00:02:23.190> sticks<00:02:24.650> like<00:02:25.650> that

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.150 

and<00:02:28.670> then<00:02:29.270> some<00:02:29.660> trees<00:02:29.960> like<00:02:30.350> this<00:02:30.620> tree<00:02:30.980> you

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
and then some trees like this tree you

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.480 
and then some trees like this tree you
cannot<00:02:31.520> cut<00:02:31.850> down<00:02:32.090> I<00:02:32.420> don't<00:02:33.050> know<00:02:33.200> why<00:02:35.290> but

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
cannot cut down I don't know why but

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.730 
cannot cut down I don't know why but
yeah<00:02:37.490> it's<00:02:37.760> a<00:02:37.880> pretty<00:02:38.120> simple<00:02:38.450> task<00:02:38.660> see<00:02:39.530> that

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
yeah it's a pretty simple task see that

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.790 
yeah it's a pretty simple task see that
extra<00:02:40.310> change<00:02:40.580> right<00:02:40.760> there<00:02:41.170> of<00:02:42.170> cutting<00:02:42.620> down

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
extra change right there of cutting down

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.460 
extra change right there of cutting down
a<00:02:42.830> tree<00:02:42.980> just<00:02:43.460> some<00:02:43.880> left<00:02:44.120> clicks<00:02:44.420> and<00:02:44.750> you

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
a tree just some left clicks and you

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.210 
a tree just some left clicks and you
cannot<00:02:45.740> hold<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.220> left-click<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:47.650> once<00:02:48.650> your

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.950 

energy<00:02:52.220> bar<00:02:52.430> is<00:02:52.610> about<00:02:52.880> halfway<00:02:53.240> down<00:02:53.630> you

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960 
energy bar is about halfway down you

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.550 
energy bar is about halfway down you
cannot<00:02:54.230> cut<00:02:54.530> down<00:02:54.740> these<00:02:55.540> giant<00:02:56.540> trees<00:02:56.630> you

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
cannot cut down these giant trees you

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.180 
cannot cut down these giant trees you
can<00:02:57.740> cut<00:02:58.010> down<00:02:58.190> this<00:02:59.000> tree<00:02:59.620> which<00:03:00.620> I<00:03:00.860> believe

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
can cut down this tree which I believe

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.480 
can cut down this tree which I believe
will<00:03:01.370> give<00:03:01.520> you<00:03:01.670> wood<00:03:01.880> for<00:03:02.630> this<00:03:02.750> tree<00:03:03.370> but<00:03:04.370> you

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
will give you wood for this tree but you

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.290 
will give you wood for this tree but you
cannot<00:03:04.820> cut<00:03:05.210> down<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:05.690> giant<00:03:06.200> trees<00:03:06.500> like

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
cannot cut down the giant trees like

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.780 
cannot cut down the giant trees like
these<00:03:08.300> ones<00:03:08.740> but<00:03:09.740> that's<00:03:09.980> it<00:03:10.220> for<00:03:10.250> this<00:03:10.610> video

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
these ones but that's it for this video

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.250 
these ones but that's it for this video
and<00:03:11.360> I<00:03:12.020> will<00:03:12.260> see<00:03:12.950> you<00:03:13.040> guys
