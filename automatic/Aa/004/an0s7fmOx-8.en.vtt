00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.880
 staying 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.030
 now we need 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.030
 baking powder and flour 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:11.700
 and gradually add it month 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.700

 I will add flour with baking powder and 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.170
 continue to stir the spatula 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:40.310
 we need the consistency of thick cream I 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:44.349
 I guess, that 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.349
 we have added enough flour with ripper 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:54.280

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.590
 I personally are 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:33.240
 inclination to fill them with paper 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:38.450
 by three fourths 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.450
 because the oven dough lift 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:46.730
 get a beautiful hat shape i 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.540
 filled in three fourths and send in 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:53.870
