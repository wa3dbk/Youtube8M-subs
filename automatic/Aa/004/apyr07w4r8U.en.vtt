can loving is my Beauty Blender every
time<00:03:18.900> I'm<00:03:19.019> done<00:03:19.230> with<00:03:19.260> it<00:03:19.500> I<00:03:19.560> always<00:03:19.799> wash<00:03:20.220> it

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
time I'm done with it I always wash it

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.430 
time I'm done with it I always wash it
because<00:03:21.000> it<00:03:21.540> does<00:03:21.780> collect<00:03:22.079> a<00:03:22.230> lot<00:03:22.350> of

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
because it does collect a lot of

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.559 
because it does collect a lot of
bacteria<00:03:22.859> so<00:03:23.340> I<00:03:23.370> wash<00:03:23.730> it<00:03:23.760> after<00:03:24.030> every<00:03:24.299> use

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
bacteria so I wash it after every use

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.690 
bacteria so I wash it after every use
and<00:03:24.810> what<00:03:25.109> you<00:03:25.230> do<00:03:25.350> is<00:03:25.380> you<00:03:25.620> soak<00:03:26.220> it<00:03:26.400> in<00:03:26.459> water

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
and what you do is you soak it in water

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.789 
and what you do is you soak it in water
and<00:03:26.819> it<00:03:27.030> actually<00:03:27.269> expands<00:03:28.019> and<00:03:28.470> then<00:03:28.650> you
