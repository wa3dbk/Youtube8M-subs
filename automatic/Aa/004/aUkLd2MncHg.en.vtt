00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.390 
you want to first attach your wheels to
the<00:01:00.929> servos<00:01:02.269> so<00:01:03.269> it<00:01:03.390> just<00:01:03.600> snip<00:01:04.409> goes<00:01:05.159> right

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
the servos so it just snip goes right

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:13.280 
the servos so it just snip goes right
into<00:01:05.550> the<00:01:05.790> servo<00:01:06.030> horn<00:01:06.300> both<00:01:06.840> ends<00:01:10.040> so

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:30.469 

you<00:01:14.220> want<00:01:14.370> to<00:01:14.430> screw<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.790> in

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.969 

next<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.350> want<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.710> attach<00:01:32.159> your<00:01:32.399> battery

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
next you want to attach your battery

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.560 
next you want to attach your battery
this<00:01:34.979> battery<00:01:35.039> I've<00:01:35.549> already<00:01:35.820> put<00:01:36.000> velcro<00:01:36.240> on

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
this battery I've already put velcro on

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.010 
this battery I've already put velcro on
the<00:01:36.600> back<00:01:36.840> here<00:01:37.229> so<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.890> could<00:01:38.039> easily<00:01:38.189> just<00:01:39.020> put

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
the back here so I could easily just put

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.910 
the back here so I could easily just put
it<00:01:40.140> on<00:01:40.259> like<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:42.049> now<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.079> have<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.469> off-center

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
it on like this now I have it off-center

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.059 
it on like this now I have it off-center
the<00:01:44.369> mass<00:01:44.549> is<00:01:44.729> off-center<00:01:45.030> for<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> reason<00:01:45.780> and

00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:46.069 
the mass is off-center for a reason and

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:50.059 
the mass is off-center for a reason and
you'll<00:01:47.069> see<00:01:47.369> why<00:01:47.520> later<00:01:48.500> you<00:01:49.500> also<00:01:49.679> have<00:01:49.920> the

00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:50.069 
you'll see why later you also have the

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:53.929 
you'll see why later you also have the
on/off<00:01:50.490> switch<00:01:50.630> so<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.720> want<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.110> attach<00:01:52.939> the

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
on/off switch so you want to attach the

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:00.969 
on/off switch so you want to attach the
on/off<00:01:54.270> switch<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.929> the<00:01:55.049> battery<00:01:58.789> like<00:01:59.789> so

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
on/off switch to the battery like so

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:08.660 
on/off switch to the battery like so
flip<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.130> around<00:02:05.000> now<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.959> VR<00:02:07.200> bot<00:02:07.979> module<00:02:08.489> I

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
flip it around now the VR bot module I

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.140 
flip it around now the VR bot module I
also<00:02:09.000> put<00:02:09.329> velcro<00:02:09.720> here<00:02:10.610> so<00:02:11.610> that<00:02:11.760> will<00:02:11.849> easily

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
also put velcro here so that will easily

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.930 
also put velcro here so that will easily
connect<00:02:14.180> right<00:02:15.180> there<00:02:16.310> so<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:17.340> module<00:02:17.910> is

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
connect right there so that module is

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.370 
connect right there so that module is
connected<00:02:18.349> and<00:02:19.349> it<00:02:19.410> will<00:02:19.530> wire<00:02:19.709> it<00:02:21.140> do<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.260> like

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
connected and it will wire it do it like

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.770 
connected and it will wire it do it like
this<00:02:22.680> so<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.400> white<00:02:23.610> wire<00:02:23.849> goes<00:02:24.180> on<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.510> far

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
this so the white wire goes on the far

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.479 
this so the white wire goes on the far
left<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:26.400> blue<00:02:26.610> wire<00:02:26.849> in<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.209> middle<00:02:28.489> like

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
left the blue wire in the middle like

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.630 
left the blue wire in the middle like
that<00:02:30.440> now<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.530> other<00:02:31.769> wire<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.160> comes<00:02:32.340> with

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
that now the other wire that comes with

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.460 
that now the other wire that comes with
it<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:33.510> black<00:02:33.720> wire<00:02:33.959> goes<00:02:33.989> on<00:02:34.349> the<00:02:34.440> outside

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
it the black wire goes on the outside

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.430 
it the black wire goes on the outside
that's<00:02:35.010> ground<00:02:35.540> while<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.780> red<00:02:36.959> goes<00:02:37.170> in<00:02:37.350> the

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
that's ground while the red goes in the

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.460 
that's ground while the red goes in the
middle<00:02:38.269> like<00:02:39.269> that<00:02:41.269> then<00:02:42.269> we<00:02:42.420> want<00:02:42.630> to<00:02:42.690> knot

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
middle like that then we want to knot

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.199 
middle like that then we want to knot
the<00:02:43.500> axon<00:02:44.069> there<00:02:44.459> are<00:02:44.549> many<00:02:44.670> ways<00:02:44.819> you<00:02:44.880> could

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
the axon there are many ways you could

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.449 
the axon there are many ways you could
do<00:02:45.359> it<00:02:45.480> you<00:02:45.600> could<00:02:45.630> either<00:02:45.840> velcro<00:02:46.440> it<00:02:46.560> on<00:02:46.709> or

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
do it you could either velcro it on or

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.300 
do it you could either velcro it on or
you<00:02:47.549> could<00:02:47.670> use<00:02:47.819> the<00:02:48.000> screw<00:02:48.269> mount<00:02:48.510> like<00:02:49.079> so

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
you could use the screw mount like so

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.050 
you could use the screw mount like so
today<00:02:50.310> I'm<00:02:50.400> going<00:02:50.549> to<00:02:50.609> do<00:02:50.700> it<00:02:50.790> really<00:02:50.910> fast

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
today I'm going to do it really fast

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.710 
today I'm going to do it really fast
because<00:02:51.660> we<00:02:51.900> don't<00:02:52.079> have<00:02:52.260> time<00:02:52.760> so<00:02:53.760> I<00:02:53.819> just<00:02:54.000> sit

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
because we don't have time so I just sit

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:03.080 
because we don't have time so I just sit
it<00:02:54.840> there<00:02:56.090> now<00:02:57.090> we<00:02:57.150> connect<00:02:57.750> the<00:03:00.410> module<00:03:02.090> so

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
it there now we connect the module so

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.250 
it there now we connect the module so
the<00:03:03.450> black<00:03:04.350> and<00:03:04.590> red<00:03:04.620> go<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:06.260> regulated

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
the black and red go to the regulated

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.699 
the black and red go to the regulated
line<00:03:07.590> on<00:03:07.859> the<00:03:08.250> exon2<00:03:08.989> so<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.109> red<00:03:10.260> lines<00:03:10.470> in

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
line on the exon2 so the red lines in

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.289 
line on the exon2 so the red lines in
the<00:03:10.799> center<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.549> black<00:03:11.790> is<00:03:12.000> on<00:03:12.180> the

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
the center and the black is on the

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.530 
the center and the black is on the
outside<00:03:13.340> we<00:03:14.340> then<00:03:14.519> want<00:03:14.700> to<00:03:14.760> connect<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.180> UART

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
outside we then want to connect the UART

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.430 
outside we then want to connect the UART
so<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.560> white<00:03:16.739> is<00:03:17.069> the<00:03:17.609> transmitted<00:03:18.349> so<00:03:19.349> it

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
so the white is the transmitted so it

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.770 
so the white is the transmitted so it
goes<00:03:19.650> to<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.310> receive<00:03:20.730> on<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.150> exon2<00:03:21.540> and

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
goes to the receive on the exon2 and

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.530 
goes to the receive on the exon2 and
we're<00:03:21.870> going<00:03:21.989> to<00:03:22.019> connect<00:03:22.349> it<00:03:22.470> -<00:03:22.680> you<00:03:22.980> are<00:03:23.160> -

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
we're going to connect it - you are -

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.210 
we're going to connect it - you are -
like<00:03:24.540> so<00:03:27.440> now<00:03:28.440> we<00:03:28.500> want<00:03:28.769> to<00:03:28.799> connect<00:03:29.130> the

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
like so now we want to connect the

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.199 
like so now we want to connect the
servos<00:03:30.230> so<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.440> left<00:03:31.650> wheel<00:03:31.889> we<00:03:32.669> are<00:03:32.790> going<00:03:33.060> to

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
servos so the left wheel we are going to

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:39.970 
servos so the left wheel we are going to
connect<00:03:33.660> it<00:03:33.810> to<00:03:35.120> b5<00:03:37.909> like<00:03:38.909> that

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
connect it to b5 like that

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:51.660 
connect it to b5 like that
and<00:03:40.069> the<00:03:40.670> right<00:03:40.819> servo<00:03:41.349> will<00:03:42.349> connect<00:03:42.680> to<00:03:42.830> b7

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.300 

voltage<00:03:52.540> the<00:03:53.440> battery<00:03:54.180> you<00:03:55.180> will<00:03:55.330> connect<00:03:55.690> to

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
voltage the battery you will connect to

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:04.410 
voltage the battery you will connect to
battery<00:03:58.770> simple<00:04:02.430> now<00:04:03.430> gather<00:04:03.760> up<00:04:04.030> your<00:04:04.180> wires

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
battery simple now gather up your wires

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:10.560 
battery simple now gather up your wires
a<00:04:04.540> little<00:04:08.430> now<00:04:09.430> they'll<00:04:09.580> hold<00:04:09.700> the<00:04:09.820> axon<00:04:10.209> often

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
a little now they'll hold the axon often

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.360 
a little now they'll hold the axon often
we're<00:04:11.230> going<00:04:11.380> to<00:04:11.440> use<00:04:11.590> order<00:04:11.890> bands<00:04:12.130> today

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
we're going to use order bands today

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.730 
we're going to use order bands today
because<00:04:12.670> I'm<00:04:12.790> lazy<00:04:13.060> I<00:04:13.440> just<00:04:14.440> want<00:04:14.590> to<00:04:14.650> make

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
because I'm lazy I just want to make

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.140 
because I'm lazy I just want to make
this<00:04:14.860> quick<00:04:15.160> for<00:04:15.340> the<00:04:15.430> tutorial<00:04:15.910> but<00:04:16.060> you

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
this quick for the tutorial but you

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.099 
this quick for the tutorial but you
should<00:04:16.329> use<00:04:16.450> a<00:04:16.480> proper<00:04:16.959> mounting<00:04:17.320> method

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
should use a proper mounting method

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:28.700 
should use a proper mounting method
here's<00:04:20.109> rubberband<00:04:25.620> rubberband

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.560 

so<00:04:29.710> now<00:04:29.860> the<00:04:29.919> axon<00:04:30.370> is<00:04:30.400> a<00:04:30.580> firmly<00:04:31.360> on<00:04:31.660> there<00:04:33.570> now

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
so now the axon is a firmly on there now

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:40.800 
so now the axon is a firmly on there now
you<00:04:34.630> want<00:04:34.900> to<00:04:34.960> gather<00:04:35.290> up<00:04:35.500> your<00:04:35.680> wires<00:04:39.810> notice

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
you want to gather up your wires notice

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.290 
you want to gather up your wires notice
the<00:04:41.020> microphone<00:04:41.530> here<00:04:41.970> you<00:04:42.970> want<00:04:43.120> to<00:04:43.150> make

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
the microphone here you want to make

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.659 
the microphone here you want to make
sure<00:04:43.330> that<00:04:43.660> the<00:04:43.810> microphone<00:04:44.380> stays<00:04:45.310> up<00:04:45.640> there

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
sure that the microphone stays up there

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:54.660 
sure that the microphone stays up there
lard

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:02.850 

and<00:04:55.670> finally<00:04:56.180> twist-tie

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.350 

so<00:05:03.400> tie<00:05:03.940> all<00:05:04.240> your<00:05:04.479> wires<00:05:04.690> on<00:05:04.960> there<00:05:06.030> now<00:05:07.030> I've

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
so tie all your wires on there now I've

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.260 
so tie all your wires on there now I've
already<00:05:07.750> programmed<00:05:07.960> the<00:05:08.379> axon<00:05:08.889> to<00:05:09.340> run<00:05:09.550> voice

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
already programmed the axon to run voice

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.760 
already programmed the axon to run voice
recognition<00:05:10.539> software<00:05:11.020> and<00:05:11.319> you<00:05:11.379> can<00:05:11.530> find

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
recognition software and you can find

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.040 
recognition software and you can find
that<00:05:11.979> on<00:05:12.370> my<00:05:12.479> website<00:05:15.539> so<00:05:16.539> you<00:05:16.599> just<00:05:16.870> flip<00:05:17.020> it

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
that on my website so you just flip it

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:23.309 
that on my website so you just flip it
on<00:05:19.169> and<00:05:20.789> it<00:05:21.789> should<00:05:21.940> run<00:05:22.060> automatically<00:05:22.870> to

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:23.319 
on and it should run automatically to

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:27.839 
on and it should run automatically to
test<00:05:23.590> it<00:05:24.690> there's<00:05:25.690> a<00:05:25.810> status<00:05:26.590> LED<00:05:27.099> can't

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:27.849 
test it there's a status LED can't

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:30.830 
test it there's a status LED can't
really<00:05:28.090> see<00:05:28.270> it<00:05:28.360> here<00:05:28.629> but<00:05:29.020> if<00:05:29.139> I<00:05:29.259> say<00:05:29.440> LED

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
really see it here but if I say LED

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.080 
really see it here but if I say LED
it'll<00:05:31.840> turn<00:05:32.020> off<00:05:32.080> and<00:05:32.530> then<00:05:32.710> back<00:05:32.860> on<00:05:33.099> which

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
it'll turn off and then back on which

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:43.550 
it'll turn off and then back on which
means<00:05:34.330> it's<00:05:34.569> working<00:05:36.569> so<00:05:38.190> left<00:05:40.889> left<00:05:41.889> right

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
means it's working so left left right

00:05:43.560 --> 00:06:08.420 
means it's working so left left right
right<00:05:48.599> forward<00:05:49.599> left<00:05:55.680> forward<00:06:00.030> left<00:06:03.030> forward

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.360 

it<00:06:09.430> also<00:06:09.789> understands<00:06:10.569> the<00:06:10.630> Thai<00:06:11.020> language<00:06:11.370> so

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
it also understands the Thai language so

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:15.950 
it also understands the Thai language so
that<00:06:12.400> command<00:06:13.360> it<00:06:13.479> to<00:06:13.659> speak<00:06:14.050> Thai<00:06:14.319> I<00:06:14.620> just<00:06:14.979> say

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
that command it to speak Thai I just say

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.920 
that command it to speak Thai I just say
Passat<00:06:16.960> Thai<00:06:17.259> and<00:06:18.029> then<00:06:19.029> I<00:06:19.180> can<00:06:19.360> send<00:06:19.599> it<00:06:19.719> any

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930 
Passat Thai and then I can send it any

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:29.540 
Passat Thai and then I can send it any
