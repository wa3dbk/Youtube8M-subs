00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.370
 hello to all children, welcome to me 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:07.430
 YouTube channel today I bring here finally 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.050
 the psuv sandwich 2014 review and before 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.670
 to start talking about the wheels themselves 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.380
 and others I see fit to make a brief 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.599
 Review of the history of surf sam's 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.609
 because it is very likely that all 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.960
 who are watching this video know what 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:19.699
 brand I'm talking about but it's also 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.130
 There may be some people who do not 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:25.070
 know the susan brand so a brief 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.080
 reviewing never comes bad your stand is a 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.660
 brand coming from france its wheel 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.759
 They have always been manufactured mainly 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.070
 there in France they were also manufactured 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.630
 sometime in Germany and finally if 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.340
 I'm not mistaken they were manufactured in 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.860
 indonesia but it really is a brand 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.050
 French its wheels have always been 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.520
 positioned on a line or high 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.400
 quality that is to say has always been the 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.640
 level of wheels like winkler guys flat 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.530
 face weeks etcetera has always been a 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.230
 work of the highest quality in the world of 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.300
 end group and in this case in 2014 have 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.850
 taken a single model although in free 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.470
 edition as you can see there are available 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.480
 two different models on the one hand 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:06.200
 we have the flows 6 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.630
 are available for 24 95 euros and for 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:13.130
 another side we have these that are the dual 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:16.040
 white for 29.95 euros make a brief 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.490
 point on flow 6 are some wheels 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.400
 with a 6 a little more elongated is 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.160
 to say they do not have a 6 for nothing is that they do not 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.619
 are nobody realistic wheels to many 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.660
 may seem the horrible I do not know but they are 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.450
 some wheels that go amazingly we go 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.490
 to arrive I have tried them and one more 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.490
 skates those wheels 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.950
 You really do not feel that you're 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.420
 rolling on some wheels it seems that 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.909
 you're not skating, it looks like you 're 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.950
 flying I do not know how but it's amazing the 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.439
 filming that have those wheels so 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.090
 they are very good wheels despite 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:52.600
 that is not the most beautiful in the world nor 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.600
 the most realistic 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.969
 but in which we are going to focus on 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.079
 this new 2014 model and we're 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:01.810
 talking about a double wheels 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:04.509
 bearing are some wheels that are worth 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.310
 both for these as author ie 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.869
 both to use them inside footwear 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.360
 surfaces like granite to wood 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.209
 etc. so as to use them outside of 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.700
 home either cement or a lot of 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.290
 materials I think are the weapons that 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.910
 more I've tried out of home before 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.400
 do the review because I gave them 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.260
 pretty cane out on the street in 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.560
 heap on surface and towards cement 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.360
 metal 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.520
 because there are no surfaces 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.000
 I have patinated them differently and 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.349
 liked as they give although personally 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.900
 I think they are some wheels that should be 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:38.000
 to use rather as wheels for inside 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.700
 of house is to say I like more how it goes in 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.130
 wood granite etcetera that as they go 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.660
 in cement or metal although it behaves 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.090
 very well and really does not spoil 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.430
 I do not even get dirty, I think that wheels 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.459
 much better for author as are the 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.709
 wills among others and I would place more 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.350
 well to scare for more anything from within 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.840
 from home the surface of the wheel is 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.900
 pretty hard are not as hard as a 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.890
 winkler wins but neither are they so 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:10.099
 soft as a wilson or wheels 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:13.720
 but you can appreciate by the sound 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.720
 that are quite hard 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.379
 as for the grip they have a grip 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:22.469
 intermediate is also saying can you 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:23.579
 do backhand and everything perfectly without 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:26.120
 no kind of problems 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.120
 also 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.890
 they respond quite well when the 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.500
 tricks and so on but they do not have so little 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.260
 gray like the winkler wheels that you see 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.110
 maybe some point not so much April as 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.550
 an amy for example that is to say is a thing 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.239
 intermediate but rather pulling to 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.920
 winkler wheel so we understand the 6 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.480
 they have is super is that I think that 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.960
 there you can appreciate it a lot in the 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.660
 The shape of the wheel is quite realistic 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.090
 Y 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.040
 and I was re-documented what is it to be 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.440
 Two double-bearing wheels are 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.930
 only for there are three that is to say neither 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.670
 happens to you montal in black river nor you 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.040
 happen to ride them on stage 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.830
 missing probably can be 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.140
 ride on a platoon axis but where 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.270
 better will go without a doubt in haiti tracks 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.239
 they are wheels designed for back like this 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:19.269
 I recommend you only mount it in 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.120
 tracks 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.800
 then comment last when 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.470
 we ask for the wheels we get a 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.669
 packaged like this since I'm going to 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.949
 stop a bit because it's very important 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:32.560
 make a clarification about something that I 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:35.110
 they have asked a lot of jope I have 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.659
 bought scared her in 2014 but for that 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.740
 they put their so louis 2012 they are me 

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:41.449
 cheating what happens here 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.970
 to see the wheels are one hundred percent 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:46.940
 new be a completely new design 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:50.060
 for 2014 the only thing is that I do not know why 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.400
 have decided to reuse the design of the 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.220
 2012 packaging for wheels 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.900
 where the 14 but well I do more good 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.069
 unimportant because to the fencing what 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.139
 matter are the wheels spin 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:01.819
 incredibly well in fact if you 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:04.190
 you fix here he puts black river after 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:05.870
 edition and no joke or is not you 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.780
 happen to ride this exemplary river 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.639
 because they're going to go very well for us if it's that 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.490
 we get to mount them properly they are 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:15.919
 wheels back like I just said 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.479
 in stocking the packaging inside us 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:19.910
 the four wheels would come with the 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:21.740
 movements mounted and would come 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.330
 substance stickers these stickers 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.340
 They are incredible because the mounts 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.830
 I was here at the table 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.780
 here you can skate with the table 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.270
 provide etcetera and you will see how a 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.860
 sticker is not scratch is amazing because 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.770
 we know that the tingui stickers are not 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.479
 very good because they take on ryans but 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.759
 we know that they have cold at the end it is not 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:42.349
 they stay white and so on but you're 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:44.330
 sustenance stickers are great 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:46.520
 for this because they do not crack are some 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:49.479
 stickers as you can see here 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.479
 transparent 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:56.039
 and I do not know how then what the drawing is not 

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:57.629
 we are going to shut up or anything so they are 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:59.240
 very good to put them in setup 

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:01.400
 etc 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.960
 and well I think this is all if I 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.580
 I left something behind you can leave me 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.849
 in the comments if you have any left 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.800
 doubt 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:08.449
 can you ask me without any kind of 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.949
 problem that I will try to answer what 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:14.270
 as possible as always and nothing 

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:16.759
 I recommend these wheels although they are not 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:20.539
 armed as cheap as others 

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:22.069
 there are very good there and the 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:24.349
 filming they have is super good 

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:27.020
 paramentos are very very good 

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:29.930
 are some off-road wheels are worth so much 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.669
 for between home like outside I think that 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.139
 little more can you ask for a wheel 

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:36.110
 maybe they entered bieber blanes 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:37.699
 trans but good being a model of 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.319
 double treatment because I think that 

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:41.449
 complies with everything you have to meet 

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:44.479
 so I recommend nothing 

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:45.860
 some I leave the link friday or for 

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:50.449
 down in the description so you can 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:52.130
 get these wheels for 29.95 euros and 

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:53.509
 nothing this has been all 

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:56.120
 I leave you now with some tricks for 

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:57.979
 that you see how nothing behaves and nothing 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.550
 if you liked the lyrics like 

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:00.550
 subscribe 

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:09.690
