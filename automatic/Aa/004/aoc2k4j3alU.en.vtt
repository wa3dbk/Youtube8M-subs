00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
in my previous videos I described how

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.360 
in my previous videos I described how

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
little further than the legs and it

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.490 
little further than the legs and it
starts<00:01:16.450> to<00:01:16.600> look<00:01:16.720> a<00:01:16.870> little<00:01:16.990> like<00:01:17.320> the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
starts to look a little like the

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.780 
starts to look a little like the

my arms and legs in different planes at
the<00:01:24.520> same<00:01:24.730> time<00:01:25.090> I'm<00:01:25.510> building<00:01:26.320> strength<00:01:26.740> and

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
the same time I'm building strength and

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.540 
the same time I'm building strength and
balance<00:01:27.160> in<00:01:27.730> a<00:01:27.940> greater<00:01:28.210> range<00:01:28.600> of<00:01:28.930> movement

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.700 

these<00:01:33.550> squats<00:01:34.030> focus<00:01:34.870> my<00:01:35.050> training<00:01:35.590> on

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
these squats focus my training on

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.890 
these squats focus my training on
building<00:01:36.190> strength<00:01:36.580> for<00:01:36.970> the<00:01:37.060> load<00:01:37.270> explode

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
building strength for the load explode

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.070 
building strength for the load explode
in<00:01:38.229> a<00:01:38.320> Tanner<00:01:38.560> stroke<00:01:39.360> but<00:01:40.360> I<00:01:40.420> need<00:01:40.630> to<00:01:40.780> train

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
in a Tanner stroke but I need to train

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.020 
in a Tanner stroke but I need to train
with<00:01:41.320> my<00:01:41.500> feet<00:01:41.800> in<00:01:41.830> a<00:01:42.100> variety<00:01:42.250> of<00:01:42.729> positions

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
with my feet in a variety of positions

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.109 
with my feet in a variety of positions
to<00:01:43.750> prepare<00:01:44.260> me<00:01:44.470> properly<00:01:44.890> for<00:01:45.369> a<00:01:45.400> stroke<00:01:45.760> like

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
to prepare me properly for a stroke like

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.200 
to prepare me properly for a stroke like
the<00:01:46.300> volley

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
the volley

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.520 
the volley
this<00:01:49.210> is<00:01:49.390> starting<00:01:49.750> to<00:01:49.870> look<00:01:49.990> more<00:01:50.050> like<00:01:50.290> a

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
this is starting to look more like a

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.670 
this is starting to look more like a
lunge<00:01:50.860> than<00:01:51.310> a<00:01:51.400> squat<00:01:51.810> but<00:01:52.810> really<00:01:53.170> a<00:01:53.200> lung<00:01:53.440> is

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
lunge than a squat but really a lung is

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
lunge than a squat but really a lung is
just<00:01:53.920> a<00:01:54.040> squat<00:01:54.370> going<00:01:54.970> somewhere<00:01:55.420> this

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
just a squat going somewhere this

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.680 
just a squat going somewhere this
movement<00:01:57.700> would<00:01:57.850> have<00:01:57.910> been<00:01:58.150> far<00:01:58.420> less

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
movement would have been far less

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.200 
movement would have been far less
successful<00:01:58.900> if<00:01:59.650> I'd<00:01:59.950> only<00:02:00.100> trained<00:02:00.670> with<00:02:01.060> my

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
successful if I'd only trained with my

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.830 
successful if I'd only trained with my
feet<00:02:01.480> side<00:02:01.840> by<00:02:02.140> side<00:02:02.440> shoulder<00:02:03.220> width<00:02:03.430> apart

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.380 

extending<00:02:07.840> my<00:02:07.960> arms<00:02:08.410> in<00:02:08.590> these<00:02:08.770> positions

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
extending my arms in these positions

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.910 
extending my arms in these positions
increases<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.570> load<00:02:10.750> for<00:02:11.260> my<00:02:11.350> glutes<00:02:11.680> and

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
increases the load for my glutes and

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.550 
increases the load for my glutes and
hamstrings<00:02:12.600> training<00:02:13.600> them<00:02:13.810> to<00:02:14.080> cope<00:02:14.290> with

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
hamstrings training them to cope with

hamstrings training them to cope with
the<00:02:14.680> load<00:02:14.890> explode<00:02:15.490> you<00:02:16.210> can<00:02:16.420> see<00:02:16.660> in<00:02:16.810> this

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
the load explode you can see in this

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.670 
the load explode you can see in this
back<00:02:17.200> hand<00:02:18.240> it's<00:02:19.240> really<00:02:19.570> a<00:02:19.600> single<00:02:20.050> leg<00:02:20.260> squat

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
back hand it's really a single leg squat

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.370 
back hand it's really a single leg squat
with<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.370> glutes<00:02:21.610> in<00:02:21.850> my<00:02:22.030> right<00:02:22.270> leg<00:02:22.380> working

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
with the glutes in my right leg working

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.699 
with the glutes in my right leg working
hardest<00:02:24.030> by<00:02:25.030> raising<00:02:25.450> my<00:02:25.570> arms<00:02:25.600> further<00:02:26.200> to<00:02:26.620> an

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
hardest by raising my arms further to an

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.770 
hardest by raising my arms further to an
overhead<00:02:26.980> position<00:02:27.640> in<00:02:27.820> these<00:02:28.030> squats<00:02:28.480> I

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
overhead position in these squats I

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.680 
overhead position in these squats I
start<00:02:29.440> to<00:02:29.650> work<00:02:29.860> my<00:02:30.220> hip<00:02:30.459> flexors<00:02:31.090> and<00:02:31.300> arms
