00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.650
 hernán sillero 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.210
 the audi r8 is almost finished yet the technicians put back the 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.210
 doors in the body 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.259
 seen from the side the car does not look like a r8 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:24.259
 it lacks its distinctive wings 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:28.099
 they fulfill both a practical and design function 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.190
 in my state we saw that for the r8 we need the spoiler to solve the 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.540
 problem of the long visual appearance of the base of the wheel 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.510
 we use it as a design trick or and then with another function 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.290
 john foos we also use it to contrast the painting work of the 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.940
 author people of copeco using colors and materials different acts in the 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.960
 sports like carbon fiber to show that the car is clivia not 9 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.160
 Ailerons are one of the many options that buyers can 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.160
 order a factory at the dealership 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.159
 there the car admirers can have a tactile experience with each 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.159
 option 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.090
 they can sit in the driver's seat 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.750
 feel the soft leather 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.990
 and the incrustations entity 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.170
 poper the different kinds of wheels and wheels 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.249
 some customers are lucky to pick up a new r8 at the factory 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.430
 I waited a long time for this car is perfect I like to have the steering wheel 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.680
 now in my hands 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.680
 it's great once 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.500
 This is not a family environment 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.500
 and it's certainly not economical 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.500
 the version of 8 costs about 82 thousand euros 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.150
 but if you still want more 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.590
 the 10 will cost 1 140 thousand euros 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.350
 from the factory they can drive it at high speed on the highway 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.879
 just strolling through the historical area of ​​germany 

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:17.729
 efe in germany we have no speed limit and this car goes to more than 300 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:20.729
 kilometers per hour I'm dying to try it 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:29.939
 but the r8 will not go anywhere unless it has its privileges 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.480
 this final touch celebrates the company's long history of victories 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.480
 at the finish line 

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:47.239
 for all this when we saw the tests of the r8 we wanted as designers 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.319
 give them a unique touch 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.039
 evoking in a certain way the past so that they had a relation with subjects 

00:02:54.039 --> 00:03:00.309
 of the race cars of the 1930s and 1940s 

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:03.309
 we wanted to give it a modest historical touch 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:13.699
 in the last assembly station the r8 rests for the first time on its own 

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:18.429
 the vital fluids of the car are already running 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.329
 then a review to the electrical system light the steering wheel 

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:32.650
 finally the technician takes the car to his first driving test 

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:36.179
 they do not go to highway 

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:38.099
 a cotillion goes 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:44.059
 pum pum pum pum pum pum the most wonderful step in the assembly of 

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:46.039
 author is the final test bank 

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:51.089
 what you hear the engine that works for the first time with all the 

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:54.589
 car factories have a roller where the car is driven at a speed 

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:56.259
 moderate 

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:58.499
 the r8 technicians shoot it 

00:03:58.499 --> 00:04:01.889
 accelerate it at a speed of up to 190 kilometers per hour 

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:08.330
 there verify the systems like the address 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.519
 the transmission and the brakes 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.519
 efe 

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:18.349
 for the last time the insurgent inspectors of the r8 make a revision 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:20.719
 fast 

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:23.719
 at this point it is very unusual to find something bad 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.510
 eight days after the r8 started as raw aluminum 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.240
 left the road for a final test the factory requires a 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.240
 perfect performance 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:43.699
 the numbers to complete it are amazing 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:46.759
 more than five thousand pieces 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:50.059
 70 manufacturing hours 

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:53.449
 and 120 of the best audi operators 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:56.449
 only for an adult 

00:04:57.559 --> 00:05:01.779
 this debate is good to be able to manufacture a car with a small group of workers 

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:03.759
 so know how to know them all 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:08.460
 Chávez who works in the building and who put his hands on abortion by 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.460
 example said 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.789
 there is no doubt 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:18.629
 operators are proud to be the team allows that manufactures a car 

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:21.150
 this caliber 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.910
 When the day ends the audi technicians leave the facility knowing 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.130
 that manufactured a car that achieved maximum performance 

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:33.629
 to make this wonderful sports car r8 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:35.919
 you need a megafactory
