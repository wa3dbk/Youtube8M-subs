change so I think that whore deal was
just<00:01:48.380> kind<00:01:48.619> of<00:01:48.709> went<00:01:49.369> left<00:01:49.579> that<00:01:49.789> way<00:01:49.969> so<00:01:50.030> what

weight on his shoulders and i felt like

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.530 
weight on his shoulders and i felt like
it<00:03:14.860> was<00:03:15.010> just<00:03:15.220> his<00:03:15.400> his<00:03:15.670> time<00:03:15.939> where<00:03:16.239> he<00:03:16.390> was

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
it was just his his time where he was

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.149 
it was just his his time where he was
ready<00:03:16.780> to<00:03:16.840> go<00:03:17.319> make<00:03:17.530> something<00:03:17.769> different

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:18.159 
ready to go make something different

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:19.949 
ready to go make something different
where<00:03:18.280> he<00:03:18.370> didn't<00:03:18.579> have<00:03:18.700> to<00:03:18.849> you<00:03:19.420> know<00:03:19.540> be<00:03:19.720> that

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.500 
where he didn't have to you know be that
that<00:03:20.500> star<00:03:20.769> player<00:03:21.040> so<00:03:21.280> I<00:03:21.310> think<00:03:22.060> it<00:03:22.180> was<00:03:22.299> just

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510
