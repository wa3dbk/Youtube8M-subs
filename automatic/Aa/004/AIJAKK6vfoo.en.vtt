 conclusion of a long process of 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.720
 development managed silently 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.309
 without clamor on which in the last 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.680

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.990
 required for technical skills 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.420
 necessary for the lack of a network 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.759
 distribution of the brand at the level 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.320

 done silently in ghost sheds 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.340
 around Italy for two years 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.580

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.860
 the hospitality it deserves and have created 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.630
 something extraordinary Julia 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.370
 represents the starting point of 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.459
 this process of reconstruction of the 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.170
 mark on the basis of his DNA of those 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.930
 elements that define the code 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.540
 alpha genetic and today is ready to perform 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.849

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:52.420
 carried with a sense of incompleteness 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:54.239
 who shouted revenge to leave her as she was to 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.500
 compete with generalist brands 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:03:00.130
 it would have meant to betray its spirit 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.050
 and values ​​also betray all women and 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.900

 our brand and the mechanics of 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.489
