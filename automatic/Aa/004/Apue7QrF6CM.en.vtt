standard<00:00:17.940> time<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.539> i<00:00:18.990> found<00:00:19.320> out<00:00:19.380> that<00:00:19.710> the

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
standard time and i found out that the

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.160 
standard time and i found out that the
games<00:00:20.460> were<00:00:20.670> not<00:00:20.880> live<00:00:21.090> stream<00:00:21.449> so<00:00:21.930> i<00:00:21.960> thought

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
games were not live stream so i thought

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.900 
games were not live stream so i thought
i<00:00:22.230> would<00:00:22.289> try<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.650> record<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.279> now

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
i would try and record it and now

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.990 
i would try and record it and now
luckily<00:00:24.210> i<00:00:24.390> got<00:00:24.570> into<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.050> very<00:00:25.320> last<00:00:25.560> game

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
luckily i got into the very last game

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.800 
luckily i got into the very last game
initially<00:00:27.000> they<00:00:27.119> say<00:00:27.330> they<00:00:27.449> were<00:00:27.510> going<00:00:27.599> to

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
initially they say they were going to

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.259 
initially they say they were going to
send<00:00:28.140> out<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.349> game<00:00:28.619> advice<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.220> everyone<00:00:29.429> but<00:00:30.210> i

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
send out a game advice to everyone but i

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.120 
send out a game advice to everyone but i
think<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:30.810> got<00:00:31.109> out<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.289> control<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.740> everyone

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
think it got out of control and everyone

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.470 
think it got out of control and everyone
just<00:00:32.160> started<00:00:32.460> joining<00:00:32.790> so<00:00:33.090> they<00:00:33.180> could<00:00:33.329> get<00:00:33.450> a

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
just started joining so they could get a

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.420 
just started joining so they could get a
game<00:00:33.719> in<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:34.530> i'm<00:00:34.590> not<00:00:34.739> sure<00:00:34.800> if<00:00:35.070> everyone<00:00:35.309> got
