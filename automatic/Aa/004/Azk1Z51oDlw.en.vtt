00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.889 
increase flexibility and mobility so
that's<00:00:38.910> exactly<00:00:39.239> what<00:00:39.420> we're<00:00:39.600> going<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.750> do

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
hips from side to side and this will

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.020 
hips from side to side and this will
help<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.670> warm<00:00:48.629> up<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.160> increase<00:00:50.160> mobility<00:00:50.460> in

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
help to warm up and increase mobility in

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.540 
help to warm up and increase mobility in
the<00:00:51.210> hip<00:00:51.420> joint<00:00:51.719> itself<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.949> as<00:00:53.250> you're<00:00:53.460> doing

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
doing some hip circles

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.020 
doing some hip circles
we<00:01:04.199> actually<00:01:04.350> rotate<00:01:04.949> your<00:01:05.070> hips<00:01:05.339> clockwise

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
for about 10 or 20 rotations and then do

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.870 
for about 10 or 20 rotations and then do
them<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.930> counterclockwise<00:01:10.640> for<00:01:11.640> another

10<00:01:12.090> or<00:01:12.119> 20<00:01:12.450> rotations<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:13.229> as<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.979> do<00:01:14.159> these

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
10 or 20 rotations and as you do these

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.090 
10 or 20 rotations and as you do these
hip<00:01:14.790> circles<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.869> may<00:01:16.020> even<00:01:16.229> feel<00:01:16.590> your<00:01:16.860> hips

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
hip circles you may even feel your hips

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.700 
hip circles you may even feel your hips
pop<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.820> crack<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.119> little<00:01:18.360> bit<00:01:18.630> because<00:01:19.290> again

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
pop and crack a little bit because again

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.429 
pop and crack a little bit because again
you're<00:01:19.860> working<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.759> hip<00:01:21.600> joint<00:01:21.900> moving<00:01:22.350> it

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
you're working the hip joint moving it

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.260 
you're working the hip joint moving it
around<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:22.979> socket<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.520> limbering<00:01:24.240> up

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
around in the socket and limbering up

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.940 
around in the socket and limbering up
all<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.840> muscles<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.470> connective<00:01:25.590> tissue

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
all the muscles and connective tissue

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.179 
all the muscles and connective tissue
around<00:01:26.670> your<00:01:26.880> hips<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.020> kind<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.680> visualize

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
around your hips so I kind of visualize

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.640 
around your hips so I kind of visualize
yourself<00:01:29.369> doing<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:30.000> virtual<00:01:30.479> hula-hoop<00:01:31.409> here

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
yourself doing a virtual hula-hoop here

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.679 
yourself doing a virtual hula-hoop here
as<00:01:31.860> you're<00:01:32.070> swinging<00:01:32.820> your<00:01:33.090> hips<00:01:33.270> around<00:01:33.420> and

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
as you're swinging your hips around and

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.569 
as you're swinging your hips around and
you<00:01:33.750> try<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:33.990> keep<00:01:34.110> your<00:01:34.290> head<00:01:34.579> stationary

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
you try and keep your head stationary

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.899 
you try and keep your head stationary
and<00:01:35.790> simply<00:01:36.450> move<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.900> hips<00:01:37.140> in<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.250> rotational

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
and simply move the hips in a rotational

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.149 
and simply move the hips in a rotational
fashion<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.600> again<00:01:39.810> it's<00:01:39.990> it's<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.680> weird<00:01:40.920> move

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
fashion and again it's it's a weird move

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.310 
fashion and again it's it's a weird move
but<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.909> works<00:01:42.150> really<00:01:42.420> good<00:01:42.570> for<00:01:42.750> limbering

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
but it works really good for limbering

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.899 
but it works really good for limbering
up<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.590> hip<00:01:43.770> joint<00:01:46.189> now<00:01:47.189> after<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.700> we're

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
up the hip joint now after that we're

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.660 
up the hip joint now after that we're
going<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.119> do<00:01:48.299> some<00:01:48.689> leg<00:01:49.200> swings<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.950> this<00:01:50.430> is

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
going to do some leg swings and this is

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.030 
going to do some leg swings and this is
a<00:01:50.909> form<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.479> dynamic<00:01:51.630> stretching<00:01:52.560> where

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
a form of dynamic stretching where

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.590 
a form of dynamic stretching where
you're<00:01:53.220> going<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.399> swing<00:01:53.700> your<00:01:53.820> leg<00:01:54.000> forwards

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
you're going to swing your leg forwards

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.929 
you're going to swing your leg forwards

really activate the hips so the idea of
squatting<00:05:44.390> in<00:05:44.720> front<00:05:45.020> of<00:05:45.140> the<00:05:45.200> wall<00:05:45.380> is<00:05:45.650> that

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
squatting in front of the wall is that

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.219 
squatting in front of the wall is that
the<00:05:46.580> wall<00:05:46.729> is<00:05:47.150> going<00:05:47.390> to<00:05:47.510> keep<00:05:47.750> you<00:05:47.930> in<00:05:48.140> a

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:48.229 
the wall is going to keep you in a

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:50.800 
the wall is going to keep you in a
perfect<00:05:48.800> upright<00:05:49.220> posture<00:05:49.520> it's<00:05:50.479> going<00:05:50.750> to

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
perfect upright posture it's going to

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.010 
perfect upright posture it's going to
force<00:05:51.110> your<00:05:51.350> hips<00:05:51.590> out<00:05:51.830> wide<00:05:52.190> and<00:05:52.550> as<00:05:53.300> you<00:05:53.660> sink

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
force your hips out wide and as you sink

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.690 
force your hips out wide and as you sink
down<00:05:54.080> you're<00:05:54.500> really<00:05:54.950> going<00:05:55.130> to<00:05:55.220> feel<00:05:55.460> your

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700

hips<00:05:55.970> activate<00:05:56.750> as<00:05:56.930> you're<00:05:57.620> doing<00:05:57.830> the<00:05:57.919> squat

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.040 
hips activate as you're doing the squat

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.850 
hips activate as you're doing the squat
