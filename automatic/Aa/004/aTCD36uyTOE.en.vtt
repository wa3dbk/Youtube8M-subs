more activities than you originally

more activities than you originally
think<00:04:35.150> you<00:04:35.270> are<00:04:35.450> in<00:04:35.840> this<00:04:36.380> case<00:04:36.620> the<00:04:36.800> resume

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
think you are in this case the resume

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.800 
think you are in this case the resume
allows<00:04:37.460> you<00:04:37.610> to<00:04:37.730> include<00:04:37.940> additional

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
activities and to group them in a way

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:47.740 
activities and to group them in a way
that<00:04:40.760> makes<00:04:40.970> sense<00:04:46.150> here<00:04:47.150> we've<00:04:47.419> included

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
that makes sense here we've included

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.159 
that makes sense here we've included
some<00:04:48.080> examples<00:04:48.650> of<00:04:49.000> schools<00:04:50.000> that<00:04:50.240> don't<00:04:50.780> take

some examples of schools that don't take

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:52.720 
some examples of schools that don't take
the<00:04:51.320> common<00:04:51.650> application<00:04:52.220> the<00:04:52.400> way<00:04:52.520> that

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:52.730 
the common application the way that

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.390 
the common application the way that
their<00:04:52.970> activities<00:04:53.570> sections<00:04:53.990> look<00:04:54.280> here<00:04:55.280> we

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
their activities sections look here we

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.890 
their activities sections look here we
have<00:04:55.520> the<00:04:55.640> University<00:04:56.060> of<00:04:56.150> Michigan<00:04:56.540> which<00:04:56.720> as

have the University of Michigan which as

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.470 
have the University of Michigan which as
you<00:04:57.050> can<00:04:57.080> see<00:04:57.260> is<00:04:57.710> is<00:04:58.040> different<00:04:58.730> in<00:04:59.060> some<00:04:59.300> ways

00:04:59.470 --> 00:04:59.480 
you can see is is different in some ways

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.120 
you can see is is different in some ways
from<00:04:59.660> the<00:04:59.810> common<00:05:00.110> app<00:05:00.230> but<00:05:00.440> it's<00:05:00.560> generally

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
from the common app but it's generally

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.030 
from the common app but it's generally
the<00:05:01.280> same<00:05:01.460> idea<00:05:01.850> we've<00:05:02.840> also<00:05:03.110> included<00:05:03.560> here<00:05:03.980> a

the same idea we've also included here a

the same idea we've also included here a

different from the common app in that

different from the common app in that
they<00:05:09.380> simply<00:05:09.740> ask<00:05:09.919> students<00:05:10.520> to<00:05:10.760> attach<00:05:11.120> a

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
which is of course what we're talking

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.670 
which is of course what we're talking
about<00:05:15.650> tonight

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.110 

now<00:05:20.680> it<00:05:20.740> may<00:05:20.949> seem<00:05:20.979> like<00:05:21.460> we're<00:05:21.699> encouraging

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
now it may seem like we're encouraging

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.939 
now it may seem like we're encouraging
everyone<00:05:22.240> to<00:05:22.660> explore<00:05:22.900> the<00:05:23.169> thesbian<00:05:23.590> within

but<00:05:26.949> the<00:05:27.190> this<00:05:27.580> grouping<00:05:28.030> could<00:05:28.330> work<00:05:28.509> for

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
but the this grouping could work for

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.320 
but the this grouping could work for
sports<00:05:29.139> or<00:05:29.380> musical<00:05:30.009> activities<00:05:30.520> something
