 Four 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.990

 What I do not understand English I'd like to enter the clan to its overseas if there is a request 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:34.670
 Should I do 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:39.890
 I kinda watch the replay Well in a it a little play star of people overseas 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.700
 Fun Rutteyuu tried to enter the Well quite overseas clan also on to learn roots play style 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.680
 With things 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.610
 a Mars and its How the the I mean there are teeth positive 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.000
 Little concrete ne 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:54.580
 I would like to explain it while showing an example 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:59.170
 This time, I'm actually in a clan called 'Ok Poker Lips' 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:05.440
 Is that it has entered a picture Well heard is the place were I originally a 10th place 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.600
 Very ne Well dare that the it is my Well, I'd have become a high-level's clan 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.110
 To 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:12.229
 Because I would like to tell you simply to put in easily 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.950
 Well I think I would like to see how I entered it 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:21.579
 It is a bus dare a 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:28.480
 Another really default message in this manner without that the strange hen stinking 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:34.390
 Nothing's good, well that's not the state's default 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:35.140
 May be little or Crans Tteyuu enter write properly their own sound feelings originally many 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.850
 I'm not 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:42.030
 First, it mainly to normally I tried to apply for leave of default 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.840
 It is straight yeah 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.280
 We were meeting approved 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.180
 The first point is stone a 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:55.440
 Properly to the greeting this is I think it's earlier than tomorrow I where carried out even if the value midas 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:59.549
 But it's really easy to say hello it's halo d 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:05.220
 Well if you really do n't say anything here 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:07.270
 But it is good if I put it in . Why is it let me put it in once? 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:12.010
 I mean that ask them properly recognized 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.420
 Also a pretty little even if it will not or can I be kick at that time from 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.989
 I think you should wait for the bat 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:20.970
 It's almost like you've entered it 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:25.200
 Suck a crown low with Puri 3 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:30.510
 Please choose a road and you can see it from the information of that clan. 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.980
 So my recommendation is to read the description of the clan you want to enter first 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.610
 I think that is important 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.470
 It's not a little idea who to understand even if you read firm 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:42.040
 Do the key properly 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.030
 Enter If you think Emerson does not protect such a way Well, it's be properly 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.380
 Let's go 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.040
 so 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:51.550
 Said to Once Well usually easy to already really good and id 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:56.069
 a is also good and easy usually like this it is say I read 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:59.370
 Apart from the other it as it is when you are obtained is simple, but the back business 3 km 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:04.139
 It sounds like it really wo n't fall in a century. 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:08.819
 It's not fun, but it's a little bit hem but I 'm going to put it in here separately 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:11.770
 Well, there were cases when I was told variously and I was told something 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:17.380
 Thank you very much about 3 types 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:19.890
 In the worst case, in this case, in some cases, assuming that case 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.390
 a There are many written 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.240
 For example Well really if Lou is important 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.540
 But thanks for reading 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.890
 It's like being donated perfectly decent like a Ne has a profile 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.910
 Because it feels like 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:38.080
 Abe- san's key and one cat point but I dare not say thank you 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:43.390
 It makes me think that this person lives in English by writing ty 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:45.230
 Then I ca n't communicate properly and I ca n't get in trouble 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:49.730
 Dare One because I do not think to say was it was somethin so 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:51.769
 I'd use slang specific also I would like to teach in this one a few slang 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:56.299
 It is the third eye 39 in the ty 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:57.319
 It doesn't matter because it's a real song, but let's talk about how to communicate 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:03.129
 It means that we will go 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:05.250
 Theme Here I was told that I saw how much food you had 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:08.940
 Nyan is it like a thing 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.760
 The answer will you do so and Soshitara softening this person most 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.810
 Or epiglottis 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.950

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:51.130

 Really it's also you can see that it 's are welcome Well and upset 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:02.470
 We think that it was good to put in well well 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:07.220
 In this way we'd have been described this time in the distribution feeling 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:11.210

 I think you said Toka 1009 So for that in we have decided Speaking here at the np is 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:30.460
 After that I think that one can say with serious so take the I communication is there only 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.580
 Is it 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.580
 When 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:41.260

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:56.900
 It feels like 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:59.990

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.790

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:06.050

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:17.320
 That's why it's takex, right? 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:19.030
 It's really a story It is the moon that has entered now that it is better to remember 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:25.390
 Until it really enters 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:26.830
 Nothing eh read properly rear of the rules contained I feel be the first thing that rule 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:31.390
 I think it is important 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:36.340
 In order to get with the Kanta that good image was the ne properly after image 

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:39.020
 If you feel like you donate properly and you're feeling clan playing for that 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:45.740
 And it swelled improvement It is often received from mate 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:48.919
 If you check email sent to Adakarasu and do exactly that 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.620
 I think that I want to it to be able to attack Nezu 2 times 

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:54.060
 If so 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:59.620
 Because I think that there is nothing to be solved 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:07:03.850
