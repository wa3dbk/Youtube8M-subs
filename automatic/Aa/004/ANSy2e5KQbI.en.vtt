00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.230 
here on top what I like to do is pinch
the<00:01:44.080> thread<00:01:44.320> in<00:01:44.410> between<00:01:44.680> my<00:01:44.830> fingers<00:01:45.220> for<00:01:46.150> the

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
the thread in between my fingers for the

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.490 
the thread in between my fingers for the
first<00:01:46.450> strap<00:01:46.660> and<00:01:46.870> then<00:01:46.960> pull<00:01:47.170> straight<00:01:47.200> down

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
first strap and then pull straight down

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.010 
first strap and then pull straight down
what<00:01:47.770> that<00:01:47.800> does<00:01:48.130> it<00:01:48.310> doesn't<00:01:48.430> allow<00:01:48.790> the

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
what that does it doesn't allow the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.200 
what that does it doesn't allow the
marabou<00:01:50.020> to<00:01:50.230> wrap<00:01:50.440> around<00:01:50.860> and<00:01:51.310> start

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
marabou to wrap around and start

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.510 
marabou to wrap around and start
spinning<00:01:52.570> around<00:01:52.780> your<00:01:53.080> hook<00:01:53.230> but<00:01:54.160> we'll<00:01:54.310> cut

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
spinning around your hook but we'll cut

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.730 
spinning around your hook but we'll cut
off<00:01:54.550> this<00:01:54.820> excess<00:01:55.270> here<00:01:55.570> cut<00:01:56.200> it<00:01:56.230> at<00:01:56.440> an<00:01:56.560> angle

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
off this excess here cut it at an angle

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.230 
off this excess here cut it at an angle
what<00:01:57.130> that<00:01:57.280> will<00:01:57.400> do<00:01:57.550> is<00:01:57.580> your<00:01:57.850> tying<00:01:58.090> it<00:01:58.210> down

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
what that will do is your tying it down

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.170 
what that will do is your tying it down
it<00:01:58.540> gives<00:01:58.720> you<00:01:58.810> kind<00:01:58.930> of<00:01:59.050> a<00:01:59.140> sloped<00:01:59.500> groove

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
it gives you kind of a sloped groove

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.360 
it gives you kind of a sloped groove
rather<00:02:01.180> than<00:02:01.390> a<00:02:01.420> sharp<00:02:01.810> edge<00:02:02.070> makes<00:02:03.070> it<00:02:03.190> look<00:02:03.310> a

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
rather than a sharp edge makes it look a

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.640 
rather than a sharp edge makes it look a
little<00:02:03.460> more<00:02:03.580> realistic<00:02:04.230> what<00:02:05.230> I'm<00:02:05.320> doing<00:02:05.560> now

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
little more realistic what I'm doing now

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.639 
little more realistic what I'm doing now
with<00:02:05.800> my<00:02:05.950> fingers<00:02:06.220> just<00:02:06.250> kind<00:02:06.580> of<00:02:06.610> ripping<00:02:06.970> off

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
with my fingers just kind of ripping off

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.990 
with my fingers just kind of ripping off
giving<00:02:08.649> myself<00:02:08.800> probably<00:02:09.250> about<00:02:09.520> I<00:02:09.700> don't

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
giving myself probably about I don't

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.790 
giving myself probably about I don't
know<00:02:10.090> half<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.600> length<00:02:10.780> 3/4<00:02:11.470> of<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.650> length

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
know half the length 3/4 of the length

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.059 
know half the length 3/4 of the length
of<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.040> hook<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:13.330> a<00:02:13.450> tail<00:02:13.690> there

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
of the hook of a tail there

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.349 
of the hook of a tail there
like<00:02:15.159> to<00:02:15.280> rip<00:02:15.430> it<00:02:15.549> off<00:02:15.640> rather<00:02:15.819> and<00:02:16.060> cut<00:02:16.209> in<00:02:16.299> a

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:16.359 
like to rip it off rather and cut in a

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:18.660 
like to rip it off rather and cut in a
straight<00:02:16.420> square<00:02:17.140> edge<00:02:17.379> gives<00:02:18.249> it<00:02:18.400> more<00:02:18.519> of<00:02:18.609> a

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
straight square edge gives it more of a

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.699 
straight square edge gives it more of a
realistic<00:02:19.209> look<00:02:19.420> I<00:02:19.540> feel<00:02:19.810> once<00:02:20.230> it's<00:02:20.439> a<00:02:20.530> little

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
realistic look I feel once it's a little

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.470 
realistic look I feel once it's a little
bit<00:02:20.829> easier<00:02:20.859> so<00:02:21.430> it<00:02:21.519> makes<00:02:21.700> it<00:02:21.790> nice<00:02:21.939> we're

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
bit easier so it makes it nice we're

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.720 
bit easier so it makes it nice we're
gonna<00:02:22.540> tighten<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:22.989> silver<00:02:23.260> wire<00:02:23.439> now<00:02:23.730> you

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
gonna tighten the silver wire now you

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.119 
gonna tighten the silver wire now you
don't<00:02:25.060> have<00:02:25.329> to<00:02:25.389> do<00:02:25.719> this<00:02:25.900> step<00:02:26.290> I<00:02:26.590> would

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
don't have to do this step I would

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:30.119 
don't have to do this step I would
recommend<00:02:27.579> having<00:02:28.290> this<00:02:29.290> fly<00:02:29.560> with<00:02:29.859> and

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
recommend having this fly with and

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.990 
recommend having this fly with and
without<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.999> silver<00:02:31.450> wire<00:02:32.019> I<00:02:32.650> learned<00:02:33.459> of<00:02:33.879> the

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
without the silver wire I learned of the

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.819 
without the silver wire I learned of the
fly<00:02:34.239> originally<00:02:34.810> without<00:02:35.139> the<00:02:35.319> silver<00:02:35.620> wire<00:02:35.799> I

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
fly originally without the silver wire I

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:39.629 
fly originally without the silver wire I
ended<00:02:36.189> up<00:02:36.280> at<00:02:36.489> it<00:02:36.670> and<00:02:36.819> on<00:02:37.290> to<00:02:38.290> kind<00:02:39.250> of<00:02:39.310> give<00:02:39.459> me

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:39.639 
ended up at it and on to kind of give me

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:42.059 
ended up at it and on to kind of give me
an<00:02:39.760> effect<00:02:40.209> kind<00:02:40.900> of<00:02:41.019> like<00:02:41.139> your<00:02:41.319> zebra<00:02:41.560> midgel

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
an effect kind of like your zebra midgel

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.309 
an effect kind of like your zebra midgel
have<00:02:42.299> but<00:02:43.299> I've<00:02:43.480> got<00:02:43.659> a<00:02:43.689> lot<00:02:43.840> of<00:02:43.900> fish<00:02:44.139> on<00:02:44.290> a

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
have but I've got a lot of fish on a

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:45.869 
have but I've got a lot of fish on a
zebra<00:02:44.560> edge<00:02:44.889> and<00:02:45.129> so<00:02:45.280> I<00:02:45.310> thought<00:02:45.609> this<00:02:45.730> would

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
zebra edge and so I thought this would

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.089 
zebra edge and so I thought this would
be<00:02:45.939> a<00:02:46.060> good<00:02:46.239> add<00:02:46.450> to<00:02:47.019> it<00:02:47.169> and<00:02:47.319> it<00:02:47.680> really<00:02:47.859> has

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
be a good add to it and it really has

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:49.649 
be a good add to it and it really has
been<00:02:48.340> it's<00:02:48.519> done<00:02:48.700> really<00:02:48.879> really<00:02:48.969> well<00:02:49.180> for<00:02:49.329> me

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:49.659 
been it's done really really well for me

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:53.839 
been it's done really really well for me
I'm<00:02:50.650> gonna<00:02:50.769> tie<00:02:51.099> on<00:02:51.219> this<00:02:51.459> red<00:02:52.139> vinyl<00:02:53.139> rib

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
I'm gonna tie on this red vinyl rib

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.580 
I'm gonna tie on this red vinyl rib
again<00:02:54.849> we're<00:02:55.299> leaving<00:02:55.870> ourselves<00:02:55.989> about<00:02:56.560> a

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
again we're leaving ourselves about a

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.849 
again we're leaving ourselves about a
quarter<00:02:57.209> length<00:02:58.209> of<00:02:58.389> the<00:02:58.480> hook<00:02:58.689> still<00:02:59.169> so<00:02:59.769> we

00:02:59.849 --> 00:02:59.859 
quarter length of the hook still so we

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:02.429 
quarter length of the hook still so we
have<00:02:59.980> time<00:03:00.219> or<00:03:00.519> enough<00:03:00.879> room<00:03:01.090> to<00:03:01.120> to<00:03:01.989> dub<00:03:02.199> and

have time or enough room to to dub and

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:05.119 
have time or enough room to to dub and
tie<00:03:02.980> off<00:03:03.219> and<00:03:03.489> and<00:03:03.760> not<00:03:04.000> get<00:03:04.209> too<00:03:04.359> close<00:03:04.540> and

tie off and and not get too close and
with<00:03:06.129> wrapping<00:03:06.519> it<00:03:06.609> we're<00:03:06.730> just<00:03:06.760> gonna<00:03:07.000> go

with wrapping it we're just gonna go

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.390 
with wrapping it we're just gonna go
around<00:03:07.590> side<00:03:08.590> by<00:03:08.799> side

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
around side by side

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
between this is going to give kind of

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.069 
between this is going to give kind of
the<00:03:32.400> imitation<00:03:33.400> of<00:03:33.609> segments<00:03:34.120> give<00:03:34.299> you<00:03:34.419> a<00:03:34.479> 3d

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
the imitation of segments give you a 3d

image for the fish to look at for

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:42.749 
image for the fish to look at for
segmentations<00:03:39.699> on<00:03:39.879> the<00:03:40.060> on<00:03:40.269> the<00:03:40.569> larva<00:03:41.759> get

segmentations on the on the larva get

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:45.059 
segmentations on the on the larva get
this<00:03:42.939> up<00:03:43.120> here<00:03:43.359> and<00:03:43.479> and<00:03:43.840> tie<00:03:44.560> it<00:03:44.620> off<00:03:44.769> what<00:03:45.040> I

here is it it's glossy effect really
makes<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:52.299> bug<00:03:52.449> look<00:03:52.750> transparent<00:03:53.819> which<00:03:54.819> is

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
makes the bug look transparent which is

just helps segment the bug make it

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.940 
just helps segment the bug make it
hopefully<00:04:33.820> look<00:04:34.210> more<00:04:34.390> realistic<00:04:34.720> catch<00:04:35.170> get
