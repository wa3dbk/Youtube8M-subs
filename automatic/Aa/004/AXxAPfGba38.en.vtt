have<00:02:00.990> them<00:02:01.229> like<00:02:01.409> two<00:02:01.619> gigabytes<00:02:02.130> bigger

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
have them like two gigabytes bigger

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.920

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
kills so i basically just used like one

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.140 
kills so i basically just used like one
shot<00:02:10.860> head<00:02:11.129> shots<00:02:11.459> instead<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:11.910> like

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
shot head shots instead of like

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.670 
shot head shots instead of like
when<00:02:12.269> I<00:02:12.299> missed<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.720> first<00:02:12.959> bullet<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.500> stuff

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
when I missed the first bullet and stuff

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.649 
when I missed the first bullet and stuff
like<00:02:13.829> that<00:02:13.890> because<00:02:14.250> that<00:02:14.640> kind<00:02:15.030> of<00:02:15.180> sucks<00:02:15.450> for

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
like that because that kind of sucks for

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.660 
like that because that kind of sucks for
the<00:02:15.750> most<00:02:15.959> part<00:02:16.170> like<00:02:16.739> clips<00:02:17.069> like<00:02:17.189> this<00:02:17.430> one

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
the most part like clips like this one

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.130 
the most part like clips like this one
when<00:02:17.849> I<00:02:17.879> missed<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.360> first<00:02:18.569> bullet<00:02:18.810> and

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
when I missed the first bullet and

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.990 
when I missed the first bullet and
basically<00:02:19.409> kind<00:02:19.799> of<00:02:19.950> kind<00:02:20.459> of<00:02:20.610> shit<00:02:20.790> load<00:02:20.970> of

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
basically kind of kind of shit load of

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.880 
basically kind of kind of shit load of
those<00:02:21.299> away<00:02:21.720> but<00:02:21.989> that<00:02:22.170> was<00:02:22.349> such<00:02:22.560> a<00:02:22.590> long

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
those away but that was such a long

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.490 
those away but that was such a long
range<00:02:23.220> so<00:02:23.610> I<00:02:23.849> was<00:02:24.360> like<00:02:24.540> ah<00:02:24.659> I<00:02:24.959> gotta<00:02:25.230> keep<00:02:25.439> that

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
range so I was like ah I gotta keep that

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.660 
range so I was like ah I gotta keep that
one<00:02:25.920> at<00:02:26.069> least<00:02:27.079> and<00:02:28.079> I<00:02:28.500> tried<00:02:28.769> to<00:02:28.980> put<00:02:29.250> them<00:02:29.489> in

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
one at least and I tried to put them in

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.849 
one at least and I tried to put them in
order<00:02:29.970> after<00:02:30.269> which<00:02:30.840> map<00:02:31.170> they're<00:02:31.560> all<00:02:31.680> wrong

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:31.859 
order after which map they're all wrong

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.339 
order after which map they're all wrong
because<00:02:32.340> some<00:02:32.819> time<00:02:32.970> I<00:02:33.090> asked<00:02:33.390> them<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:33.840> usually

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
because some time I asked them I usually

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:35.839 
because some time I asked them I usually
try<00:02:34.439> to<00:02:34.530> record<00:02:34.890> all<00:02:35.129> the<00:02:35.340> time<00:02:35.609> but<00:02:35.790> sometimes

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
try to record all the time but sometimes

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.500 
try to record all the time but sometimes
I<00:02:36.359> I<00:02:36.659> just<00:02:37.379> forget<00:02:37.739> to<00:02:37.890> record<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.609> this<00:02:39.060> was

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
I I just forget to record and this was

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.449 
I I just forget to record and this was
cool<00:02:39.989> because<00:02:40.170> I<00:02:40.620> couldn't<00:02:41.040> see<00:02:41.220> him<00:02:41.400> anymore

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
cool because I couldn't see him anymore

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.690 
cool because I couldn't see him anymore
and<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:43.049> could<00:02:43.470> guarantee<00:02:43.799> he<00:02:44.280> was<00:02:44.430> out<00:02:44.639> of

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
and you could guarantee he was out of

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.759 
and you could guarantee he was out of
sight<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.269> that<00:02:45.389> bullet<00:02:45.750> shouldn't<00:02:46.079> have<00:02:46.560> hit

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
sight and that bullet shouldn't have hit

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.300 
sight and that bullet shouldn't have hit
him<00:02:46.799> that's<00:02:47.639> the<00:02:48.060> worst<00:02:48.450> part<00:02:48.690> about

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
him that's the worst part about

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.890 
him that's the worst part about
battlefield<00:02:50.310> right<00:02:50.639> now<00:02:50.819> that's<00:02:51.359> the<00:02:51.450> only

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
battlefield right now that's the only

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.449 
battlefield right now that's the only
part<00:02:52.109> I<00:02:52.260> don't<00:02:52.319> like<00:02:52.530> otherwise<00:02:53.159> I<00:02:53.430> think

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
part I don't like otherwise I think

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.059 
part I don't like otherwise I think
everything<00:02:54.329> worked<00:02:54.569> fine<00:02:54.780> I<00:02:55.230> think<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.799> game

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
everything worked fine I think the game

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.149 
everything worked fine I think the game
is<00:02:56.099> kick-ass<00:02:56.909> I<00:02:57.120> mean<00:02:57.269> 10<00:02:57.540> out<00:02:57.720> of<00:02:57.750> 10<00:02:58.159> even

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 
is kick-ass I mean 10 out of 10 even

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:01.339 
is kick-ass I mean 10 out of 10 even
that<00:02:59.280> little<00:02:59.340> thing<00:02:59.849> wouldn't<00:03:00.359> destroy<00:03:01.049> that

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
that little thing wouldn't destroy that

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.129 
that little thing wouldn't destroy that
remove<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:01.859> player<00:03:02.069> 10<00:03:02.340> out<00:03:02.459> of<00:03:02.489> 10<00:03:02.730> score<00:03:03.139> but

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:04.139 
remove the player 10 out of 10 score but

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.979 
remove the player 10 out of 10 score but
it<00:03:04.379> is<00:03:04.739> annoying<00:03:05.220> sometimes<00:03:05.689> because<00:03:06.689> I<00:03:06.810> mean

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
it is annoying sometimes because I mean

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.410 
it is annoying sometimes because I mean
that<00:03:07.319> guy<00:03:07.560> should<00:03:08.159> clearly<00:03:08.549> not<00:03:08.939> have<00:03:09.180> died

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
that guy should clearly not have died

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.020 
that guy should clearly not have died
from<00:03:09.629> a<00:03:09.780> bullet<00:03:09.989> that<00:03:10.530> basically<00:03:10.950> would<00:03:11.700> pass

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
from a bullet that basically would pass

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.899 
from a bullet that basically would pass
two<00:03:12.810> or<00:03:13.019> three<00:03:13.349> decimeters<00:03:14.189> away<00:03:14.519> from<00:03:14.760> him

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
two or three decimeters away from him

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:17.270 
two or three decimeters away from him
that's<00:03:15.120> basically<00:03:15.599> like<00:03:15.689> a<00:03:16.049> foot<00:03:16.500> away<00:03:17.099> from

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
that's basically like a foot away from

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.099 
that's basically like a foot away from
him<00:03:17.579> you<00:03:17.609> shouldn't<00:03:18.150> die<00:03:18.329> from<00:03:18.540> a<00:03:18.660> bullet<00:03:18.810> that

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
him you shouldn't die from a bullet that

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:20.990 
him you shouldn't die from a bullet that
that<00:03:19.650> isn't<00:03:19.859> even<00:03:20.160> close<00:03:20.310> to<00:03:20.430> hitting<00:03:20.760> me<00:03:20.970> I

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
that isn't even close to hitting me I

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.939 
that isn't even close to hitting me I
mean<00:03:21.150> a<00:03:21.180> foot<00:03:21.449> is<00:03:21.599> pretty<00:03:21.900> pretty<00:03:22.500> formal

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:22.949 
mean a foot is pretty pretty formal

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:24.979 
mean a foot is pretty pretty formal
three<00:03:23.250> decimeters<00:03:23.819> sometimes<00:03:24.660> it's<00:03:24.840> even

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
three decimeters sometimes it's even

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.129 
three decimeters sometimes it's even
more<00:03:25.349> actually<00:03:25.889> but<00:03:26.069> that<00:03:26.220> was<00:03:26.430> a<00:03:26.459> good<00:03:26.730> and<00:03:27.419> a

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
more actually but that was a good and a

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.020 
more actually but that was a good and a
good<00:03:28.379> way<00:03:28.709> of<00:03:28.739> showing<00:03:29.250> it<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:29.459> could<00:03:29.609> see<00:03:29.639> him

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
good way of showing it you could see him

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.149 
good way of showing it you could see him
but<00:03:30.209> when<00:03:30.419> they<00:03:30.540> bullet<00:03:30.840> basically<00:03:31.349> hit<00:03:31.859> him

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 
but when they bullet basically hit him

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:33.849 
but when they bullet basically hit him
he<00:03:32.340> wasn't<00:03:32.519> even<00:03:32.879> close<00:03:33.120> and<00:03:33.510> it<00:03:33.629> actually

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859 
he wasn't even close and it actually

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.879 
he wasn't even close and it actually
registered<00:03:34.859> as<00:03:35.069> a<00:03:35.099> head<00:03:35.849> shot<00:03:36.150> too<00:03:36.299> so<00:03:37.139> that<00:03:37.859> I

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
registered as a head shot too so that I

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:39.649 
registered as a head shot too so that I
didn't<00:03:38.430> slow<00:03:38.819> move<00:03:39.030> it<00:03:39.150> because<00:03:39.510> it<00:03:39.629> was

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:39.659 
didn't slow move it because it was

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:42.619 
didn't slow move it because it was
awesome<00:03:40.260> just<00:03:40.409> because<00:03:40.829> I<00:03:41.419> slo-mo<00:03:42.419> this

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:42.629 
awesome just because I slo-mo this

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:44.210 
awesome just because I slo-mo this
because<00:03:43.079> that's<00:03:43.290> like<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.769> most<00:03:43.919> annoying

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
because that's like the most annoying

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.550 
because that's like the most annoying
part<00:03:44.579> of<00:03:44.760> all<00:03:44.909> in<00:03:45.209> battlefield<00:03:46.109> we're

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
part of all in battlefield we're

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.860 
part of all in battlefield we're
actually<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.919> only<00:03:47.099> no<00:03:47.430> import<00:03:47.790> right<00:03:47.970> now<00:03:48.120> to

actually the only no import right now to
be<00:03:48.989> honest<00:03:49.290> I<00:03:49.379> mean<00:03:49.590> sure<00:03:50.489> I<00:03:50.810> would<00:03:51.810> like<00:03:52.019> to

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
be honest I mean sure I would like to
