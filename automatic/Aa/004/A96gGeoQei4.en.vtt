 and with this lack going to the palm trees solved many bids of this type and 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.760
 of the turkey have as their starting point was very strong but with many 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:20.350
 faults 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.980
 the minister said several opportunities there to make the goal and striking effort 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.999
 overthrew everything 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:29.060
 started the whole big play was 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.210
 the goal of the cruise 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.050
 at a crossroads 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.050
 possibly the future of our state 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.750
 nothing can do 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.840
 which I ask in the 12 minutes of the first half 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.370
 I have to could the palm trees have come out with a concrete result 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.230
 It happened 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.700
 scored the maximum penalty and at 40 minutes 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.000
 the gunner did not stop 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.470
 and ended up losing 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.860
 I talked to the game controller 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.160
 the tie practically had only two chances of flu goal 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.400
 husband's tenure 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.370
 caught the ball badly 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.010
 then another at the end 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.630
 I repeat that the blows followed 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.640
 then as you heard very loud said the forms 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.090
 the fans 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.180
 made the goal 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.270
 ahead of the ipatinga 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.580
 he complained about the bid was because it reconcile the numerical advantage and 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:23.640
 scored well 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.400
 only until april 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.350

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.120
 with the beat is what happens 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.290
 I thought it was 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.210
 in the two days it is a duty of the palm trees managed but the match had the game 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.510

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.039
 to ally with gasoline 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.339
 in the second half the West team would not score that there was a catch-grab of the 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:15.539
