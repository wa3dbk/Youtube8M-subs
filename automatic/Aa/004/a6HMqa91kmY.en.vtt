00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:06.580
 Hello, good morning, have all of you 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:08.650
 today we are going to see the muscles of the abdomen 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.090
 well first of all let's have the 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.840
 muscle 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:16.240
 external oblique ok the action of this 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.130
 when it is unilateral it will cause 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.310
 trunk rotation where it is bilateral 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:24.099
 will cause trunk flexion and 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.920
 will also help the compression of 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:29.230
 the anterior wall of the abdomen and the 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.920
 visera this when this happens is going to 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:36.070
 increase the intra-abdominal pressure your 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:39.550
 origin is going to be from the ribs and from 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:42.520
 the cartilages from 5 to 2 the insertion 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.160
 is going to be on the line alba and on the crest 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.250
 of yaco and innervation is going to be 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:51.670
 central branches from 8 to one of the 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.010
 final nerves well now we have here 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.110
 what would be aligned as not 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.970
 we can see that it is in the middle part 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:02.380
 of the abdomen 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:05.510
 we have that it's going to be a fibrous coffee 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.910
 formed by the coverage of the rectum 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.070
 earlier here they are going to join the two 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.950
 hours and coverage of the anterior rectum 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.710
 so to speak they were going to form what 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.170
 is the line alba in you here 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.440
 we have what is being covered 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:25.090
 or the sheet you want to call the 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.090
 from the previous rectuses 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.740
 now we have here the inguinal ligament 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:33.740
 that as you will remember 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.280
 will form the channel floor of 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.820
 inguinal 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.820
 okay 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.439
 here we have the shallow ring 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.439
 inguinal 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.740
 and as we can see is an opening 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:59.890
 which will be able to pass the cord 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:03.010
 sperm in the male well 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:06.070
 now already stirring 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.440
 now the fiber of the coverage of 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.620
 The previous rectices may vary 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.200
 now if the right ones good the action of 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.380
 this is going to be to flex the trunk 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:22.190
 and the compression also equal d 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:25.220
 the anterior anterior abdominal wall the 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.330
 origin is going to be in the pubis on the crest 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.330
 and in the 106 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.739
 and the insertion is going to be in the sternum 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.930
 in the process that today and in the 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:38.209
 costal cartilages from 5 to 7 the 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:43.390
 innervation will be given by branches of 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.390
 from 7 to 12 ok 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.819
 and here we are going to have a disinsertion 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.819
 stand and you have us the straight abdominal 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.920
 and we are going to have that this is going to form 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.310
 well this is going to divide more than one saying 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:00.040
 to the muscle between three to four hours 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.410
 and the parties so to speak the 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.680
 little squares the tics parts like some 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.680
 they say 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:11.030
 now we have the internal oblique 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.970
 abdominal and in the action this is going to 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.640
 be if it is unilateral will cause the 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.670
 rotation of the trunk if it is bilateral goes to 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.470
 injure the trunk and and also 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.020
 obviously it's going to help compression 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:28.190
 of the anterior wall of the abdomen and 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:32.270
 increase the intra-abdominal pressure the 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:36.380
 origin will be of the inguinal ligament 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:38.390
 of the iliac crest and the fascia for 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.670
 ccoo lumbar this we will see when 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.160
 let's see the back insert 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.470
 is going to be on the line alba and on 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.540
 costal cartilages from 7 to 10 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.390
 the innervation is closed by branches 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:55.150
 central 8 to l 1 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.270
 well now we will move to another layer more 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.740
 deep 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.810
 the transverse muscle of the abdomen 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.750
 and the action of this is only going to be 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.460
 the compression of the anterior wall of the 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.990
 abdomen and the viscus that goes to 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:12.200
 increase as the others 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:14.450
 the intra-abdominal pressure the origin goes to 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.000
 be from the iliac crest of the ligament 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.160
 inguinal of the lumbar tower phase but 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.280
 let's go after and the postmen 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:25.040
 sacks from 7 to 12 the inserts go 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.380
 to be in the pubis in your body in the 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.500
 linea alba and on the sternum in the 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.080
 process and boyd is the innervation is going to be 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.260
 given by central branches is equal 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.180
 dt 8 to 1 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.710
 we're going to have to make these muscles equal 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.710
 than all the others who have helped us 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.170
 to increase intra-abdominal pressure 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:49.870
 they will help us in lifting things 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:52.510
 heavy in defecation in urination 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:56.910
 and also in women I have to help the 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.910
 process of giving birth 

00:04:57.249 --> 00:05:03.909
 well and here we have a coverage 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:06.069
 back of the right ones that's going to 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:09.599
 give so exactly behind the 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:09.599
 straight here we can see it 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.620
 we can see that it is an aponeurosis 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:18.689
 formed of flat tendons 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:21.239
 of the abdominal muscles 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:23.150
 internal oblique and transverse 

00:05:21.239 --> 00:05:25.080
 abdominal 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.939
 all right 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:31.050
 now we will go to another part more 

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:33.030
 deep here we have the lumbar square 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.300
 the action of this when it is unilateral 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:38.879
 will cause the trunk to flex 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:41.520
 bilateral extension of the trunk and 

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:44.080
 It can also help to depress 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.680
 rib number 2 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.350
 to depress to fix 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:52.200
 the origin is going to be from the iliac crest and 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:55.350
 the insertion is going to be in the rib 12 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:59.370
 and also in the transverse processes of 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:04.890
 l1 and l4 the innervation is going to be given by 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:06.480
 central branches of 12 to 4 function 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.540
 of this is going to be going to help in the 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:12.320
 breathing 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:17.410
 well now we will pass with the psoas greater 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.410
 the action of this is going to be bending 

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:24.780
 of the world lateral rotation of the thigh 

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:27.300
 also and lateral rotation of the trunk 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:31.620
 well let's have that its origin goes to 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:34.230
 be of the vertebrae l1 l5 of the 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:37.530
 bodies of adverse processes and of 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:40.800
 the discs are so they stay between 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:43.009
 those the insertion is going to be on the subject in 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:46.039
 the lesser trochanter 

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:50.449
 and we're going to have it going to be and snowy 

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:55.249
 by ventral branches of l2 l3 normally 

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:58.659
 this muscle joins the muscle of the 

00:06:55.249 --> 00:07:00.860
 iliac muscle and also going to form in 

00:06:58.659 --> 00:07:02.950
 when this happens it will form the 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:05.140
 muscle even more 

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:06.470
 this is going to be a powerful flexor of the 

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.770
 hip 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:11.139
 all right 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:14.830
 who lacks a last one that would come 

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:18.670
 being the muscle and how we remember this 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:22.160
 it will be universal psoas greater in its part 

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:24.670
 to be terminal so to speak 

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.720
 well the action of this day with 

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:30.040
 destroy what the fraction will be like 

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:34.520
 of the thigh and the medial rotation of the thigh 

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:37.960
 the origin is going to be from the celiac in his 

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.960
 pit and sacrum 

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:43.169
 and the insertion is going to be in the femur 

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:47.039
 just like him 

00:07:43.169 --> 00:07:49.219
 that the partner in the lesser trochanter and the 

00:07:47.039 --> 00:07:52.219
 Innervation based on the femoral nerve 

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:52.219
 all right 

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:59.259
 and well that would be all if they need 

00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:01.080
 some video do not hesitate to ask and so 

00:07:59.259 --> 00:08:03.210
 for the next one I think I'm going to do 

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:06.240
 this 

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:07.660
 I do not know yet I am among many bones 

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:11.130
 but good 

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:11.130
 until after they have a good day
