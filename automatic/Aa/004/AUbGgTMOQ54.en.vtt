knob<00:00:42.550> enough<00:00:42.850> fortress<00:00:43.359> and<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:44.649> merchant

00:00:45.029 --> 00:00:45.039 
knob enough fortress and the merchant

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:50.639

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:50.649 
outside will sell them um 430 I think

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:53.910 
outside will sell them um 430 I think
it'd<00:00:50.739> be<00:00:50.890> about<00:00:51.750> 4,000<00:00:52.750> Gil<00:00:53.050> something<00:00:53.710> around

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
it'd be about 4,000 Gil something around

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.700 
it'd be about 4,000 Gil something around
there<00:00:54.719> when<00:00:55.719> I<00:00:55.750> go<00:00:56.019> I<00:00:56.050> by<00:00:56.379> 99<00:00:56.980> for<00:00:57.429> 25,000<00:00:58.329> Gil

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
there when I go I by 99 for 25,000 Gil

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.500 
there when I go I by 99 for 25,000 Gil
but<00:00:59.710> you<00:01:00.280> haven't<00:01:00.460> done<00:01:00.699> this<00:01:00.820> mission<00:01:01.210> so<00:01:01.480> I

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
but you haven't done this mission so I

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.660 
but you haven't done this mission so I
don't<00:01:02.109> think<00:01:02.379> you'd<00:01:02.559> have<00:01:02.620> that<00:01:02.980> amount<00:01:03.280> feel

such<00:03:14.760> little<00:03:15.000> health<00:03:15.299> I<00:03:16.099> thought<00:03:17.099> the<00:03:17.250> same

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
such little health I thought the same

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.020 
such little health I thought the same
thing<00:03:18.739> the<00:03:19.739> answer<00:03:20.069> to<00:03:20.099> that<00:03:20.220> question<00:03:20.549> would

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
thing the answer to that question would

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:27.289 
thing the answer to that question would
have<00:03:21.090> to<00:03:21.480> be<00:03:24.920> you're<00:03:25.920> gonna<00:03:26.010> it's<00:03:26.610> an<00:03:26.880> undead

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299
