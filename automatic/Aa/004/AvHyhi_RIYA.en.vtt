00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 Welcome to the centenary 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:10.530
 again on our channel mister 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:12.059
 helfer syndrome this video is about 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.440
 the sony playing time i have it now 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.880
 for six weeks as my main mobile phone 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.619
 used and I have some things 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.529
 attract attention the minis like and how 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.750
 Let's talk, let's go to point one 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.189
 the battery with the old tiresome topic 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.779
 smartphones again here 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.320
 we just do not have that strong 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.539
 get food 1 2330 mirko sits 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.189
 in the back the hero actually too 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.410
 through the day more but definitely not 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.930
 if you really like his cellphone many times 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.270
 uses as whatsapp plays all day 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.230
 in mails retrieves surf then becomes 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.230
 probably all day long 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.910
 The real choice also has 2300 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.010
 milliard hours but get that 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.480
 the software optimized so well that the 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.530
 a little better than here 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.270
 sonic suite z 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.059
 the second complaint is the battery 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.590
 simply that he firmly installed the scanner 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.969
 that is if you have problems with it 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.260
 has after somehow one and a half years 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.120
 two years three years he will 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.620
 worse or completely broken then you can 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.329
 you can knock the cell phone that is 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.619
 just a pity 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.600
 Point number two is the handiness 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.799
 This phone is just not nice 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.270
 in the hand and I say that as someone 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.680
 not necessarily the smallest end 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.229
 I have the world for example 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.689
 is it yvonne is not completely behind 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.970
 hide because it's just very wide 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.290
 is also still negative to that 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.630
 the edges are not rounded 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.360
 that's why it's just not nice to wear 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.070
 for hand in hand very nice hand 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.659
 comfort is not good you might have 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.549
 one or two millimeters in the 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.400
 to give up wide simply that 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.250
 better in the hand lies 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.020
 Three of the sound quality sound at x4 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.490
 z is not so good and what ever 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.840
 I'm what it's easy 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.280
 way too quiet if you like the 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.259
 Handsfree used and it one 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.850
 a little louder in the car or something 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.170
 It's really hard to get here first 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.390
 I'll play one now to illustrate 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:53.050
 song on the xpc and then with the aec 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:02:01.570
 won with the sound like that 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:02:06.190
 now we go from volume and now 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.900
 the same thing with the fc one happened aloud 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:16.840
 and much better at fuller here now 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:19.330
 volume that already a clear clear 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.400
 difference of the two parts complaint 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.480
 in girls , the speakers are here 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.870
 above and below 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.490
 Here is the speaker on the right 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.940
 down on this little sled man 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.730
 zoom 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.280
 out of this little slit comes here 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.200
 the sound out the problem is if you 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.790
 in time as I said petrow 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.790
 speaker then you hold the phone 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.590
 her right hand and almost obscured 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.330
 I always have to be angry 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.980
 embrace remediation somehow 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.110
 behave unnaturally so when I am with 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.710
 speaker does not define this 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.420
 close 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.790
 by a stupid positioning of the 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.770
 spokesman did not find point number four 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.090
 the heat development when you're in five 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.980
 minutes of video you look in the long 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.690
 Internet surfs and kills a clear one 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.489
 heat development in the upper area of ​​the 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.470
 back I would say that 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.120
 jessica alba gets hot but it is already 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.709
 at michelle hunziker level clearly 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.780
 superimposed the life of my mobile phone 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.700
 is that angela merkel is you 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.190
 should be angela merkel 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.050
 point number five dust and fingers 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.340
 axis susceptibility I'm not 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.660
 sure if you can see in the camera 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.520
 can and I have it before the video 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.320
 cleaned but especially the back 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.050
 is really prone to finger brave 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.360
 and dust so worth it 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:29.739
 as clean as possible sandy is then should 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.870
 The more often times you were in it 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.190
 So the five points I export 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.810
 not like that 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.670
 One thing I have to say before the video 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.959
 This is really a top mobile phone 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.970
 i like it a lot and the advantages 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.620
 by no means outweigh 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.520
 sometimes important also about the disadvantages 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.540
 to speak 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.400
 That's also in the comments 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.110
 Do not just discuss what you find 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.000
 this cell phone is trying objectively too 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.220
 No one will not insult any 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.220
 stay super nice 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.989
 right of me and left of you 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.700
 I listed three more videos 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:01.030
 for example, like the disadvantages 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.160
 from the htcs north channel that was 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.930
 first video still likes subscribing to it 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.800
 Do not miss the next 100 videos 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.800
 Until next time
