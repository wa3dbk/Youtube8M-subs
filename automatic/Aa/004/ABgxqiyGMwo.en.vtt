00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:13.759
 these days the field bull team that was around the institute 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:15.289
 national agronomic 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:19.509
 where the fruit department is working 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:22.789
 always in the discussion of materials in the research 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.150
 and also with the technical guidelines according to each day 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.170
 they were just left out of these birds there tells us that this is 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:37.430
 the best is little to carry out the pruning of l'hospitalet to obtain a better 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.580
 production 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.830
 we go to the special report to any citizen or with arsenal 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.719
 the pruning 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.370
 is a very important action ruth and culture this practice seeks that the 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.810
 fruit plant with good quality 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.070
 In our country 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.180
 this time is the recommended 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.350
 to make it in most fruit crops 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.330
 about techniques methods 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.870
 types of pruning and technical recommendations we talk to a technician 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.060
 national agronomic institute 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.200
 there are different types of pruning entrust to which it is made 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.200
 according to 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.659
 the species of fruit that we have 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.969
 then it has little subway we are in full epoch of doing all be 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:21.050
 fruity expression 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.620
 he has in his 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.000
 your system also according to the ones you give from the plant i 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.790
 at 13 of the plant then we have to do a well balanced pruning 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.410
 according to the type of plant that we are going afp 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.170
 perform them by then 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.310
 and it matters a lot the the portal was because at this time of the year you can 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.200
 perform 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.270
 for the fruit they like citrus 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.570
 When the border is finished, it is necessary to carry out the pruning of the td inns 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.770
 plant cleaning that are in production in order other cases are 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:57.540
 can do 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.289
 in plants that deep 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.009
 the cut still pruning cup formation training 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.620
 i in photo case raises that they are in was verbal that has many problems 

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:12.759
 edet the agasp can be done a more drastic pruning a pruning 

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:18.109
 rejuvenation I be different type of pruning according to the type of 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:21.109
 plant and according to light problems that one has 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:23.800
 fruit plants 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.189
 the time of the stern 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:28.129
 it is a very important delivery for the production 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:28.940
 thus 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.280
 fruit growers must carry it out at the right time to 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.159
 get more benefits 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:39.269
 of the plants at this time of year in the winter season is in recess for 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.969
 the sharia for 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:44.939
 is in recess not much salt circulates and then you have to take advantage of that 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:47.720
 time of year to perform all the 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.739
 It can be done by as of May 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.689
 as I told you normally in some species of fruit trees have still 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:57.599
 fruit at that time of year then you have to wait 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.859
 finish those fruit and then performed them by then normally 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:04.859
 the equestrian ending type of species 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:07.290
 by the way, you must also 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.430
 the early 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.819
 they finish having fruit 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.039
 in two months of June-July then at that time 

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:18.569
 ideally to be in citi colloto fruit species as I mentioned 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:19.719
 as well 

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:22.890
 the problem we have is that they are tropical fruits 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.089
 by his own talent then 

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:28.169
 the stupor of molledo that 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:32.659
 the vega luna the afternoon that affects you why have once a year ends of June 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:34.369
 between august 

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:38.839
 e in all this time of year I knew about the plants both in recess 

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:40.500
 then you have to take advantage at that time 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.560
 and all the species moment to the forest pc 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.699
 can be done from May 

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:48.379
 -June July to August pruning 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:52.060
 When the spring begins, the sharia begins to circulate and at that time 

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:54.729
 It is recommended spores in 

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:58.519
 I expressed Fortany and also expressed the loan because it affects him a lot 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:03:59.610
 and to the plant 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.600
 when one reviews wound at that time percent is very complicated it can be 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.930
 inclusive that 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.279
 the plants can approach if one reviews a very drastic pruning 

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:11.370
 another issue that must be highlighted 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.689
 is the importance of the technique used in pruning 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:15.889
 did some 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:17.959
 per cent pruning 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:18.979
 avda 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:20.439
 decade 

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:22.319
 percent is the most 

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:24.749
 of the main stem true 

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:28.789
 leave it little the little tips of the green branch then 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:34.059
 neither do it with machete by burning the roth when performing with machete 

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:38.029
 he can crack the plant and when the plant breaks down there and 

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:40.340
 that's why by air 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.529
 any kind of disease that will be caused by how not 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:46.090
 and that can hunt down the damage 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.740
 the main branches 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.740
 cough very important wants to know the right tool 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:54.289
 i the quota pruning system 

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:56.749
 training pruning 

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:58.919
 determines the development of the cup 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:03.139
 then the cleaning pruning is carried out and when the plant reaches its maximum 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:07.659
 development and rejuvenation pruning is done eliminating all the 

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:11.219
 dry and diseased branches to get new ones 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:15.739
 an interesting factor that supports with pruning is also the capture of light 

00:05:15.739 --> 00:05:20.729
 that is very important to guarantee the quality the quantity and the 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:22.439
 continuity of the fruits 

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:26.800
 another important issue has disinfection that must be done both 

00:05:26.799 --> 00:05:31.119
 to the approach that used as the plants after the work of pruning 

00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:34.569
 it is very important also they perform the teeth 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:39.539
 and have very well disinfected euros element of the tool that one is going to 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:40.289
 use 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:45.000
 because with the tools is if one does not disinfect the tool can 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.670
 reads take a lot of trouble other plants and a plant is with problems 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.420
 sick or with viper problems 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.869
 to be able to transmit with the tool used so far 

00:05:54.869 --> 00:05:56.169
 another healthy plant 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:00.360
 I put very important the disinfection of bitches lying to be used with 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.809
 sodium hypochlorite 

00:06:01.809 --> 00:06:06.580
 and also and of the porta very much the system and after the cut that one 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:07.659
 I was the saint 

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:12.119
 and that after that is to that court or would you appreciate that regulates the 

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:13.400
 make the plant 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.400
 it is very important to carry out a disinfection 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:20.400
 so that they plant them so that in those 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.810
 life do not penetrate 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.409
 disease has especially produced by gÃ³ngora 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:26.800
 has very important disinfection 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.180
 I played is discovered 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.770
 the copper more 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:35.870
 the lime the hydrated lime nds is called broth of brothels a kilo of copper more 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.029
 two kilos of lime 

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:40.740
 and the liter of water looked like briquette broth paint well 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.690
 the affected parts for the wound that some 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:45.169
 isa the plant then 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:48.020
 kuriles well with the dryer them 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.650
 Heal well that wound that made the plant
