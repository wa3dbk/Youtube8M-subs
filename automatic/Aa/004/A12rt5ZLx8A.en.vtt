00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:07.850
 that there are people who are watching us in 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.040
 youtube here we have another video where 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.040
 We will learn how to download the 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.679
 cns emulator and some games like 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.990
 this one that is here in wallpaper 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:21.170
 and well, how smart we have to 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:25.720
 to do is to focus on Gador and we put 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.720
 on the page called free rounds 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.930
 just as it is there 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:44.960
 and here on the ground what we are going to do is 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:47.350
 enter this little eyelash they say is 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.960
 from here to download the emulator 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:54.650
 we have to chop here in this 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.530
 says the rum is blank 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:00.070
 this tab opens and goes to 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.070
 to download 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:08.950
 but not reach here is now 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.640
 now the winrar file opens 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:16.610
 let's extract the folder 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.610
 where do you want this folder to 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.250
 and that's the regulator now we're going to 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.250
 see the games 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.570
 the star minister of the dictate 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:39.579
 already download and here it is 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:42.640
 and for example this one can play 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:45.909
 with the colors what we have to do 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.680
 is to extract this file that ends with 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.680
 puntones 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.390
 and move it to the rocks folder because 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.110
 yes no no then you will not be able to find 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:02:00.870
 the file or it's going to be very complicated 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.870
 so what we are going to do is this 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:08.190
 going now the emulator 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.410
