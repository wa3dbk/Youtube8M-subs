now the way you do that is once you put

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.530 
now the way you do that is once you put

do this is we take ourselves a ladle we
take<00:02:21.910> a<00:02:21.940> section<00:02:22.270> of<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.569> mix<00:02:22.780> and<00:02:23.230> then<00:02:23.440> you

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
take a section of the mix and then you

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.260 
take a section of the mix and then you
put<00:02:23.680> in<00:02:23.830> whatever<00:02:24.280> you<00:02:24.550> want<00:02:24.580> into<00:02:25.180> the

some<00:02:33.040> dried<00:02:33.280> blueberries<00:02:33.760> you'll<00:02:34.330> find<00:02:34.540> her<00:02:34.600> a

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
some dried blueberries you'll find her a

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.420 
some dried blueberries you'll find her a
lot<00:02:34.930> lot<00:02:35.140> sweeter<00:02:35.380> and<00:02:35.830> a<00:02:35.950> lot<00:02:36.100> more<00:02:36.220> sugar

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
lot lot sweeter and a lot more sugar

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.250 
lot lot sweeter and a lot more sugar
rich<00:02:36.730> rather<00:02:37.330> than<00:02:37.480> on<00:02:37.540> normal<00:02:37.690> blueberries

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
rich rather than on normal blueberries

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.540 
rich rather than on normal blueberries
because<00:02:38.650> they've<00:02:38.860> been<00:02:38.950> dried<00:02:39.190> out<00:02:39.400> the

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
because they've been dried out the

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.949 
because they've been dried out the
sugars<00:02:39.819> obviously<00:02:40.120> a<00:02:40.150> lot<00:02:40.270> more<00:02:40.420> compact<00:02:40.750> in

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
sugars obviously a lot more compact in

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.930 
sugars obviously a lot more compact in
there<00:02:41.170> rather<00:02:41.709> than<00:02:41.950> when<00:02:42.550> they're<00:02:42.670> just<00:02:42.820> like

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
there rather than when they're just like

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.340 
there rather than when they're just like
this<00:02:43.060> state<00:02:43.330> and<00:02:43.660> these<00:02:43.780> are<00:02:43.930> just<00:02:44.110> slightly

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
this state and these are just slightly

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.870 
this state and these are just slightly
soft<00:02:44.739> which<00:02:44.920> is<00:02:45.040> perfect<00:02:45.519> for<00:02:45.580> a<00:02:45.670> pancake

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
soft which is perfect for a pancake

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.910 
soft which is perfect for a pancake
let's<00:02:46.630> get<00:02:46.750> some<00:02:46.870> flavors<00:02:47.230> going<00:02:47.380> together<00:02:47.739> so

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
let's get some flavors going together so

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.150 
let's get some flavors going together so
when<00:02:48.010> you<00:02:48.070> use<00:02:48.190> our<00:02:48.340> banana

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
when you use our banana
