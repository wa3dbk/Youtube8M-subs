cross it in once or twice because he's

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.790 
cross it in once or twice because he's

probably going to win that header once
or<00:03:20.130> twice<00:03:20.310> he's<00:03:20.700> very<00:03:21.000> very<00:03:21.030> big<00:03:21.480> and<00:03:21.690> strong

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
player somehow give up a penalty there

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.170 
player somehow give up a penalty there
but<00:03:25.620> we've<00:03:25.770> had<00:03:25.950> plenty<00:03:26.220> of<00:03:26.370> those<00:03:26.760> penalty

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
calls go for us in this patch power so

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.260 
calls go for us in this patch power so
i'm<00:03:29.220> not<00:03:29.370> going<00:03:29.489> to<00:03:29.580> complain<00:03:29.820> too<00:03:30.090> much<00:03:30.120> about

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
i'm not going to complain too much about

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.300 
i'm not going to complain too much about
it<00:03:30.660> though<00:03:30.780> I<00:03:31.200> did<00:03:31.560> guess<00:03:31.830> right<00:03:32.100> on<00:03:32.220> the

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
it though I did guess right on the

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.820 
it though I did guess right on the
penalty<00:03:32.580> i<00:03:32.700> was<00:03:32.910> a<00:03:32.940> bit<00:03:33.239> late<00:03:33.600> reacting<00:03:34.350> to<00:03:34.650> it

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
penalty i was a bit late reacting to it

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.060 
penalty i was a bit late reacting to it
so<00:03:35.430> a<00:03:35.459> little<00:03:35.790> bit<00:03:36.030> on<00:03:36.270> lucky<00:03:36.900> there<00:03:37.140> but<00:03:37.500> in<00:03:37.800> 80

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
so a little bit on lucky there but in 80

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.430 
so a little bit on lucky there but in 80
or<00:03:38.310> in<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.489> 90th<00:03:38.880> minute<00:03:39.000> now<00:03:39.360> why<00:03:39.840> not<00:03:40.110> one

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
or in the 90th minute now why not one

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.530 
or in the 90th minute now why not one
more<00:03:40.650> goal<00:03:40.830> let's<00:03:41.370> get<00:03:41.550> this<00:03:41.670> sequence<00:03:42.150> going

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540

sure<00:04:40.320> how<00:04:40.590> that<00:04:40.770> categorizes<00:04:41.160> is<00:04:41.580> an<00:04:41.699> own<00:04:41.880> goal

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910

I<00:04:42.090> would<00:04:42.419> have<00:04:42.510> thought<00:04:42.630> that<00:04:42.690> would<00:04:42.870> have

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
I would have thought that would have

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.740 
I would have thought that would have
been<00:04:43.050> given<00:04:43.500> to<00:04:43.710> the<00:04:44.100> center<00:04:44.430> back<00:04:44.610> but<00:04:45.300> it<00:04:45.510> was

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
actually quite good thought i was a bit

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.379 
actually quite good thought i was a bit
unlucky<00:05:16.979> not<00:05:17.280> to<00:05:17.340> steal<00:05:17.699> the<00:05:17.850> ball<00:05:18.000> from<00:05:18.060> him

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:18.389

right<00:05:18.600> there<00:05:18.810> but<00:05:19.410> he<00:05:19.560> finds<00:05:20.039> Tevez<00:05:20.400> he<00:05:20.610> was

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:20.699 
right there but he finds Tevez he was

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:22.219 
right there but he finds Tevez he was
never<00:05:21.120> gonna<00:05:21.330> miss<00:05:21.539> a<00:05:21.570> little<00:05:21.870> shot<00:05:22.020> like<00:05:22.199> that

never gonna miss a little shot like that

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:24.200 
never gonna miss a little shot like that
thought<00:05:22.590> I<00:05:22.650> almost<00:05:23.100> blocked<00:05:23.400> it<00:05:23.610> but<00:05:23.820> I<00:05:23.850> did

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
thought I almost blocked it but I did

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.990 
thought I almost blocked it but I did
not<00:05:24.570> and<00:05:25.500> shortly<00:05:25.949> after<00:05:26.460> that<00:05:26.490> I<00:05:26.639> knew<00:05:26.850> my

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
not and shortly after that I knew my
