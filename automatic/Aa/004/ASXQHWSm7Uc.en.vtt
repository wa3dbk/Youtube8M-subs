00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.320 

so<00:00:01.810> here<00:00:01.959> the<00:00:02.110> two<00:00:02.290> barrels<00:00:02.830> -<00:00:03.370> rain<00:00:03.639> barrels<00:00:04.150> I

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:04.330 
so here the two barrels - rain barrels I

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.839 
so here the two barrels - rain barrels I
got<00:00:06.150> it's<00:00:07.150> the<00:00:07.240> sometime<00:00:08.170> around<00:00:08.320> in<00:00:08.620> the<00:00:09.070> fall

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:09.849 
got it's the sometime around in the fall

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:11.339 
got it's the sometime around in the fall
to<00:00:10.059> see<00:00:10.179> if<00:00:10.240> we<00:00:10.299> can<00:00:10.419> retain<00:00:10.719> some<00:00:10.990> heat<00:00:11.169> in<00:00:11.290> the

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:11.349 
to see if we can retain some heat in the

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:16.199 
to see if we can retain some heat in the
greenhouse<00:00:11.830> and<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:13.269> what<00:00:14.669> what<00:00:15.669> I<00:00:15.700> found<00:00:15.999> on

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:16.209 
greenhouse and and what what I found on

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.900 
greenhouse and and what what I found on
these<00:00:16.360> guys<00:00:16.600> is<00:00:16.990> is<00:00:17.290> obviously<00:00:17.890> the<00:00:18.130> space<00:00:18.670> I'm

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:18.910 
these guys is is obviously the space I'm

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.930 
these guys is is obviously the space I'm
trying<00:00:19.240> to<00:00:19.450> heat<00:00:20.070> two<00:00:21.070> of<00:00:21.220> them<00:00:21.400> isn't<00:00:21.880> going

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:21.940 
trying to heat two of them isn't going

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.910 
trying to heat two of them isn't going
to<00:00:22.090> do<00:00:22.210> it<00:00:22.330> they're<00:00:23.110> just<00:00:23.140> basically<00:00:23.590> rain

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:23.920 
to do it they're just basically rain

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.090 
to do it they're just basically rain
barrels<00:00:24.400> god<00:00:24.730> I<00:00:24.760> think<00:00:25.230> for<00:00:26.230> about<00:00:26.380> 15<00:00:26.800> bucks

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.100 
barrels god I think for about 15 bucks

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.730 
barrels god I think for about 15 bucks
apiece<00:00:27.340> and<00:00:28.000> seems<00:00:28.630> everywhere<00:00:29.140> in<00:00:29.410> the

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:29.740 
apiece and seems everywhere in the

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.140 
apiece and seems everywhere in the
United<00:00:30.040> States<00:00:30.280> you<00:00:30.430> can<00:00:30.550> get<00:00:30.670> these<00:00:30.820> pretty

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
United States you can get these pretty

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.599 
United States you can get these pretty
cheaply

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:32.609 
cheaply

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:35.849 
cheaply
they're<00:00:33.609> food<00:00:33.910> grade<00:00:34.329> so<00:00:35.079> you<00:00:35.499> know<00:00:35.589> there<00:00:35.739> was

00:00:35.849 --> 00:00:35.859 
they're food grade so you know there was

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:38.729 
they're food grade so you know there was
there<00:00:36.070> was<00:00:36.249> a<00:00:36.420> some<00:00:37.420> sort<00:00:37.660> of<00:00:37.780> a<00:00:37.960> edible

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
there was a some sort of a edible

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.099 
there was a some sort of a edible
something<00:00:39.219> kept<00:00:39.519> them<00:00:39.760> and<00:00:40.120> I<00:00:40.359> think<00:00:40.839> this

00:00:41.099 --> 00:00:41.109 
something kept them and I think this

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:43.950 
something kept them and I think this
must<00:00:41.499> have<00:00:41.620> been<00:00:41.710> some<00:00:41.980> sort<00:00:42.159> of<00:00:42.280> server<00:00:42.960> syrup

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
must have been some sort of server syrup

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.599 
must have been some sort of server syrup
or<00:00:44.230> soda<00:00:44.440> or<00:00:44.710> something<00:00:45.039> like<00:00:45.159> that<00:00:45.399> so

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:45.609 
or soda or something like that so

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:47.369 
or soda or something like that so
eventually<00:00:46.329> down<00:00:46.480> the<00:00:46.539> road<00:00:46.870> if<00:00:47.019> you<00:00:47.140> choose

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
eventually down the road if you choose

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:50.309 
eventually down the road if you choose
to<00:00:47.409> use<00:00:47.800> them<00:00:47.949> for<00:00:48.129> our<00:00:48.999> rainwater<00:00:49.390> recovery

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:50.319 
to use them for our rainwater recovery

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:52.169 
to use them for our rainwater recovery
or<00:00:50.499> some<00:00:50.679> sort<00:00:50.859> of<00:00:50.920> multi-purpose<00:00:51.550> you<00:00:52.059> know

00:00:52.169 --> 00:00:52.179 
or some sort of multi-purpose you know

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:54.059 
or some sort of multi-purpose you know
you<00:00:52.239> can<00:00:52.479> do<00:00:52.659> that<00:00:52.899> as<00:00:53.440> opposed<00:00:53.829> to<00:00:53.890> getting

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:54.069 
you can do that as opposed to getting

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:56.750 
you can do that as opposed to getting
something<00:00:54.370> that<00:00:54.579> held<00:00:54.789> a<00:00:54.909> chemical<00:00:55.420> that

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
something that held a chemical that

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
something that held a chemical that
eventually<00:00:57.760> you<00:00:57.879> you<00:00:58.089> wouldn't<00:00:58.329> be<00:00:58.449> able<00:00:58.690> to

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
eventually you you wouldn't be able to

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.239 
eventually you you wouldn't be able to
clean<00:00:58.989> out<00:00:59.170> to<00:00:59.289> do<00:00:59.350> anything<00:00:59.530> with<00:00:59.769> so<00:00:59.949> anyway

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:00.249 
clean out to do anything with so anyway

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:01.860 
clean out to do anything with so anyway
got<00:01:00.579> these<00:01:00.789> two<00:01:00.969> to<00:01:01.089> try<00:01:01.210> to<00:01:01.300> keep<00:01:01.510> some<00:01:01.690> heat

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
got these two to try to keep some heat

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.200 
got these two to try to keep some heat
in<00:01:01.989> here<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:03.370> is<00:01:03.429> one<00:01:03.670> of<00:01:03.729> the<00:01:03.819> failures<00:01:03.999> of

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
in here this is one of the failures of

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.160 
in here this is one of the failures of
the<00:01:04.390> year

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
the year

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.950 
the year
in<00:01:05.799> terms<00:01:06.130> of<00:01:06.310> keeping<00:01:06.939> the<00:01:07.180> greenhouse<00:01:07.600> warm

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
in terms of keeping the greenhouse warm

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.249 
in terms of keeping the greenhouse warm
they<00:01:08.649> if<00:01:09.399> I<00:01:09.759> could<00:01:09.969> guessed<00:01:10.329> and<00:01:10.659> made<00:01:10.869> I<00:01:10.899> would

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
they if I could guessed and made I would

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.410 
they if I could guessed and made I would
say<00:01:11.500> they<00:01:12.189> probably<00:01:12.219> gave<00:01:12.790> me<00:01:12.939> a<00:01:12.969> percentage

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
say they probably gave me a percentage

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.600 
say they probably gave me a percentage
of<00:01:13.750> one<00:01:13.990> degree<00:01:14.229> difference<00:01:14.920> in<00:01:15.189> the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
of one degree difference in the

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.539 
of one degree difference in the
greenhouse<00:01:16.030> but<00:01:16.600> what<00:01:16.840> I<00:01:16.869> noticed<00:01:17.549> was

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
greenhouse but what I noticed was

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:20.130 
greenhouse but what I noticed was
something<00:01:18.909> interesting<00:01:19.090> thought<00:01:19.780> I'd<00:01:19.899> share

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
something interesting thought I'd share

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.100 
something interesting thought I'd share
the<00:01:20.350> amazing<00:01:20.530> power<00:01:21.009> of<00:01:21.219> the<00:01:21.430> Sun<00:01:21.700> in<00:01:22.110> passive

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
the amazing power of the Sun in passive

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.490 
the amazing power of the Sun in passive
heating<00:01:23.350> if<00:01:23.950> you<00:01:24.039> spend<00:01:24.369> time<00:01:24.610> is<00:01:25.350> got<00:01:26.350> my

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
heating if you spend time is got my

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.190 
heating if you spend time is got my
raspberry<00:01:27.009> down<00:01:27.280> there<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.689> I<00:01:28.780> think<00:01:28.840> they're

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
raspberry down there and I think they're

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.929 
raspberry down there and I think they're
Walmart<00:01:29.890> two<00:01:30.159> or<00:01:30.280> three<00:01:30.460> bucks<00:01:30.670> something

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
Walmart two or three bucks something

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:33.209 
Walmart two or three bucks something
like<00:01:31.090> that<00:01:31.420> but<00:01:32.109> the<00:01:32.439> raspberry<00:01:32.890> is<00:01:32.979> actually

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:33.219 
like that but the raspberry is actually

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:35.370 
like that but the raspberry is actually
quite<00:01:33.399> happy<00:01:33.759> in<00:01:33.969> between<00:01:34.570> the<00:01:34.689> barrels<00:01:35.049> but

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
quite happy in between the barrels but

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.450 
quite happy in between the barrels but
anyway<00:01:35.710> I<00:01:36.539> put<00:01:37.539> my<00:01:37.869> temperature<00:01:38.740> sensor<00:01:39.130> down

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
anyway I put my temperature sensor down

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.240 
anyway I put my temperature sensor down
here<00:01:39.729> between<00:01:39.880> the<00:01:40.210> barrels<00:01:40.570> and<00:01:41.159> for<00:01:42.159> the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
here between the barrels and for the

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.649 
here between the barrels and for the
last<00:01:42.549> three<00:01:43.509> days<00:01:44.399> we<00:01:45.399> basically<00:01:45.850> had<00:01:46.119> no<00:01:46.359> son

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
last three days we basically had no son

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:52.740 
last three days we basically had no son
it's<00:01:46.899> been<00:01:47.500> pure<00:01:50.549> pure<00:01:51.549> cloudy<00:01:52.030> days<00:01:52.359> and

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
it's been pure pure cloudy days and

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.709 
it's been pure pure cloudy days and
quite<00:01:53.590> cold<00:01:53.859> in<00:01:54.159> the<00:01:54.640> 40s<00:01:55.030> each<00:01:55.210> day<00:01:55.479> in<00:01:55.659> the

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:55.719 
quite cold in the 40s each day in the

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:58.139 
quite cold in the 40s each day in the
20s<00:01:56.109> each<00:01:56.200> night<00:01:56.469> but<00:01:57.249> that<00:01:57.399> sensor<00:01:57.939> right

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
20s each night but that sensor right

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.020 
20s each night but that sensor right
there<00:01:58.450> between<00:01:58.869> those<00:01:59.289> two<00:01:59.850> barrels<00:02:00.850> at

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
there between those two barrels at

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.359 
there between those two barrels at
trashcan<00:02:01.600> in<00:02:01.749> that<00:02:01.869> one<00:02:02.020> barrel<00:02:02.380> it<00:02:02.890> will<00:02:03.159> not

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
trashcan in that one barrel it will not

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.889 
trashcan in that one barrel it will not
drop<00:02:03.820> beneath<00:02:04.259> 38<00:02:05.259> degrees<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:07.299> I<00:02:07.329> find<00:02:07.749> it

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
drop beneath 38 degrees so I find it

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.089 
drop beneath 38 degrees so I find it
extremely<00:02:08.409> interesting<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.769> rest<00:02:11.980> of

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
extremely interesting the the rest of

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.270 
extremely interesting the the rest of
the<00:02:12.190> greenhouse<00:02:12.580> will<00:02:12.819> get<00:02:13.030> down<00:02:13.300> to

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
the greenhouse will get down to

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.710 
the greenhouse will get down to
basically<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.459> temperature<00:02:15.640> outdoors<00:02:16.390> and

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
basically the temperature outdoors and

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.320 
basically the temperature outdoors and
in<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.380> evening<00:02:17.830> I<00:02:17.890> did<00:02:18.069> not<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.459> worst<00:02:19.000> part

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
in the evening I did not the worst part

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.990 
in the evening I did not the worst part
of<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.450> evening<00:02:19.840> but<00:02:20.560> between<00:02:21.310> these<00:02:21.550> barrels

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
of the evening but between these barrels

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.140 
of the evening but between these barrels
in<00:02:22.150> and<00:02:22.270> around<00:02:22.480> these<00:02:22.630> barrels<00:02:23.080> it<00:02:23.260> is<00:02:23.980> uh

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
in and around these barrels it is uh

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.720 
in and around these barrels it is uh
it's<00:02:25.150> holding<00:02:25.600> around<00:02:26.230> 40<00:02:26.560> degrees

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
it's holding around 40 degrees

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.180 
it's holding around 40 degrees
I<00:02:27.959> watched<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.110> thermometer<00:02:29.620> all<00:02:29.740> night<00:02:30.010> one

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
I watched the thermometer all night one

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.520 
I watched the thermometer all night one
night<00:02:30.220> and<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:31.420> first<00:02:31.660> night<00:02:31.870> it<00:02:32.020> stayed<00:02:32.380> at

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
night and the first night it stayed at

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.770 
night and the first night it stayed at
45<00:02:33.010> and<00:02:33.040> it<00:02:33.459> wasn't<00:02:33.819> even<00:02:33.880> a<00:02:33.970> sunny<00:02:34.450> day<00:02:34.720> so

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
45 and it wasn't even a sunny day so

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.809 
45 and it wasn't even a sunny day so
it's<00:02:35.080> not<00:02:35.200> like<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.620> black<00:02:35.860> paint<00:02:36.160> absorbed<00:02:36.730> a

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
it's not like the black paint absorbed a

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.030 
it's not like the black paint absorbed a
lot<00:02:37.000> of<00:02:37.180> Sun<00:02:37.360> it<00:02:38.050> was<00:02:38.200> just<00:02:38.319> a<00:02:38.380> cloudy<00:02:38.650> day<00:02:38.800> so

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
lot of Sun it was just a cloudy day so

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.120 
lot of Sun it was just a cloudy day so
on<00:02:39.910> a<00:02:40.030> cloudy<00:02:40.420> day<00:02:40.600> with<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:41.200> clouds<00:02:41.470> shading

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
on a cloudy day with the clouds shading

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.410 
on a cloudy day with the clouds shading
and<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:43.180> greenhouse<00:02:44.489> shading<00:02:45.489> the<00:02:46.120> Sun

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
and the greenhouse shading the Sun

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.000 
and the greenhouse shading the Sun
because<00:02:46.720> I<00:02:46.780> didn't<00:02:47.050> come<00:02:47.110> out<00:02:47.260> here<00:02:47.320> and<00:02:47.650> knock

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
because I didn't come out here and knock

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.720 
because I didn't come out here and knock
the<00:02:48.220> mist<00:02:48.459> off<00:02:49.860> these<00:02:50.860> barrels<00:02:51.310> were<00:02:51.459> somehow

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
the mist off these barrels were somehow

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.660 
the mist off these barrels were somehow
able<00:02:52.630> to<00:02:53.080> hold<00:02:54.300> just<00:02:55.300> enough<00:02:55.660> heat<00:02:55.989> to<00:02:56.670> keep

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
able to hold just enough heat to keep

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.030 
able to hold just enough heat to keep
that<00:02:57.880> center<00:02:58.180> on<00:02:58.390> 45<00:02:58.810> degrees<00:02:59.230> so<00:02:59.410> I<00:02:59.440> would

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
that center on 45 degrees so I would

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.809 
that center on 45 degrees so I would
guess<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:01.000> barrels<00:03:01.360> are<00:03:01.480> probably<00:03:02.700> you<00:03:03.700> know

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
guess the barrels are probably you know

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:05.610 
guess the barrels are probably you know
holding<00:03:04.120> probably<00:03:04.480> around<00:03:04.660> 50<00:03:05.200> degrees<00:03:05.230> or

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
holding probably around 50 degrees or

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.350 
holding probably around 50 degrees or
something<00:03:06.130> like<00:03:06.250> that<00:03:06.310> maybe<00:03:06.700> a<00:03:06.850> little<00:03:07.060> less

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
something like that maybe a little less

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.050 
something like that maybe a little less
and<00:03:07.720> so<00:03:08.019> you<00:03:08.620> know<00:03:08.739> within<00:03:08.950> a<00:03:09.160> few<00:03:09.340> inches<00:03:09.400> off

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
and so you know within a few inches off

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.110 
and so you know within a few inches off
the<00:03:10.360> barrel<00:03:10.780> you<00:03:11.620> know<00:03:11.739> that<00:03:11.950> that<00:03:12.280> is<00:03:12.700> keeping

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
the barrel you know that that is keeping

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.470 
the barrel you know that that is keeping
the<00:03:13.239> temperature<00:03:13.750> out<00:03:14.019> at<00:03:14.709> a<00:03:14.739> steady<00:03:15.190> a<00:03:15.519> steady

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
the temperature out at a steady a steady

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.560 
the temperature out at a steady a steady
comfortable<00:03:17.470> degree<00:03:18.370> rate<00:03:18.519> so<00:03:18.970> anyway<00:03:19.239> I<00:03:19.269> just

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
comfortable degree rate so anyway I just

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.240 
comfortable degree rate so anyway I just
I<00:03:19.600> found<00:03:19.930> that<00:03:20.079> extremely<00:03:20.590> interesting

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
I found that extremely interesting

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.220 
I found that extremely interesting
something<00:03:21.640> I<00:03:21.730> want<00:03:21.880> to<00:03:21.940> try<00:03:22.090> to<00:03:22.150> expand<00:03:22.690> on<00:03:22.930> and

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
something I want to try to expand on and

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.640 
something I want to try to expand on and
I<00:03:24.269> think<00:03:25.269> I<00:03:25.329> saw<00:03:25.480> a<00:03:25.510> video<00:03:25.780> not<00:03:26.200> too<00:03:26.380> long<00:03:26.590> ago

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
I think I saw a video not too long ago

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.850 
I think I saw a video not too long ago
where<00:03:27.100> someone<00:03:27.299> planted<00:03:28.709> plants<00:03:29.709> right

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
where someone planted plants right

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.710 
where someone planted plants right
around<00:03:30.130> their<00:03:30.340> barrels<00:03:30.790> and<00:03:31.030> the<00:03:31.390> plants

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
around their barrels and the plants

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.210 
around their barrels and the plants
literally<00:03:32.140> hugged<00:03:32.470> the<00:03:32.650> barrel<00:03:33.010> because

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
literally hugged the barrel because

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.710 
literally hugged the barrel because
that's<00:03:33.519> where<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:33.790> heat<00:03:33.970> was<00:03:34.180> and<00:03:34.480> so<00:03:34.600> the

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
that's where the heat was and so the

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.350 
that's where the heat was and so the
plant<00:03:34.959> would<00:03:35.190> would<00:03:36.190> just<00:03:36.400> hold<00:03:36.579> hold<00:03:37.090> tight

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
plant would would just hold hold tight

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.990 
plant would would just hold hold tight
to<00:03:37.510> the<00:03:37.630> barrel<00:03:37.989> in<00:03:38.110> the<00:03:38.170> winter<00:03:38.709> so<00:03:39.430> I<00:03:39.730> might

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
to the barrel in the winter so I might

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.490 
to the barrel in the winter so I might
experiment<00:03:40.420> with<00:03:40.720> that<00:03:40.900> might<00:03:41.110> throw<00:03:41.350> some

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
experiment with that might throw some

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.900 
experiment with that might throw some
tomatoes<00:03:41.650> down<00:03:42.070> there<00:03:42.280> around<00:03:42.400> the<00:03:42.549> barrels

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
tomatoes down there around the barrels

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.420 
tomatoes down there around the barrels
but<00:03:43.120> anyway<00:03:43.930> it<00:03:44.320> was<00:03:44.380> a<00:03:44.560> failure<00:03:44.890> as<00:03:45.160> far<00:03:45.340> as

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
but anyway it was a failure as far as

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.880 
but anyway it was a failure as far as
keeping<00:03:45.700> the<00:03:45.760> greenhouse<00:03:46.239> warm<00:03:46.630> I<00:03:46.930> think<00:03:47.829> I

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
keeping the greenhouse warm I think I

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.920 
keeping the greenhouse warm I think I
need<00:03:48.040> a<00:03:48.070> lot<00:03:48.310> more<00:03:48.340> barrels<00:03:48.910> but<00:03:49.209> it<00:03:49.359> was<00:03:49.480> a<00:03:49.510> it

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
need a lot more barrels but it was a it

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.270 
need a lot more barrels but it was a it
was<00:03:49.989> a<00:03:50.109> major<00:03:50.320> success<00:03:51.010> for<00:03:51.340> uh<00:03:53.070> and<00:03:54.070> just

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
was a major success for uh and just

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.349 
was a major success for uh and just
learning<00:03:54.900> that<00:03:56.310> yeah<00:03:57.310> you<00:03:57.370> know<00:03:57.700> within<00:03:57.940> a<00:03:58.090> few

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
learning that yeah you know within a few

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:00.210 
learning that yeah you know within a few
inches<00:03:58.600> of<00:03:58.810> these<00:03:59.049> barrels<00:03:59.410> it<00:03:59.739> actually

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
inches of these barrels it actually

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.670 
inches of these barrels it actually
stays<00:04:00.579> it<00:04:01.329> can<00:04:01.510> stay<00:04:01.720> climbing<00:04:02.260> and<00:04:02.410> you<00:04:02.470> could

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
stays it can stay climbing and you could

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.729 
stays it can stay climbing and you could
probably<00:04:02.859> get<00:04:03.190> away<00:04:03.310> with<00:04:04.200> going<00:04:05.200> a<00:04:05.350> winter

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
probably get away with going a winter

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.880 
probably get away with going a winter
and<00:04:05.950> maybe<00:04:06.400> planting<00:04:07.410> plants<00:04:08.410> in<00:04:08.530> between

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
and maybe planting plants in between

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.550 
and maybe planting plants in between
those<00:04:09.100> barrels<00:04:09.549> that<00:04:09.989> that<00:04:10.989> require<00:04:11.350> a<00:04:11.380> little

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
those barrels that that require a little

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.440 
those barrels that that require a little
more<00:04:11.829> heat<00:04:12.040> now<00:04:12.459> would<00:04:12.700> would<00:04:12.880> be<00:04:13.030> interesting

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
more heat now would would be interesting

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.710 
more heat now would would be interesting
to<00:04:13.540> see<00:04:13.780> is<00:04:13.989> when<00:04:14.590> I<00:04:14.920> get<00:04:15.670> a<00:04:15.700> real<00:04:16.120> sunny<00:04:16.450> day

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
to see is when I get a real sunny day

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.190 
to see is when I get a real sunny day
here<00:04:17.400> how<00:04:18.400> much<00:04:18.579> heat<00:04:18.789> they<00:04:18.940> absorb<00:04:19.329> so<00:04:20.019> one<00:04:20.169> of

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
here how much heat they absorb so one of

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.930 
here how much heat they absorb so one of
the<00:04:20.289> things<00:04:20.440> I'll<00:04:20.590> probably<00:04:20.859> do<00:04:21.190> is<00:04:21.430> and

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
the things I'll probably do is and

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.580 
the things I'll probably do is and
trying<00:04:22.330> to<00:04:22.419> understand<00:04:22.900> and<00:04:23.110> learn<00:04:23.200> all<00:04:23.409> this

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
trying to understand and learn all this

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.850 
trying to understand and learn all this
stuff<00:04:23.650> and<00:04:24.099> maybe<00:04:24.700> put<00:04:24.970> a<00:04:25.000> little<00:04:25.210> bit<00:04:25.390> of

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
stuff and maybe put a little bit of

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.540 
stuff and maybe put a little bit of
science<00:04:26.860> to<00:04:27.070> it

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
science to it

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.939 
science to it
from<00:04:27.789> my<00:04:27.940> perspective<00:04:28.270> anyway<00:04:28.750> is<00:04:29.229> I<00:04:29.620> probably

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:29.949 
from my perspective anyway is I probably

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:31.379 
from my perspective anyway is I probably
throw<00:04:30.069> a<00:04:30.099> temperature<00:04:30.550> sensor<00:04:30.879> down<00:04:31.090> in<00:04:31.300> the

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
throw a temperature sensor down in the

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:32.909 
throw a temperature sensor down in the
barrel<00:04:31.750> and<00:04:31.900> maybe<00:04:32.319> throw<00:04:32.560> one<00:04:32.710> on<00:04:32.740> the

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
barrel and maybe throw one on the

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:34.860 
barrel and maybe throw one on the
outside<00:04:33.310> of<00:04:33.460> the<00:04:33.520> barrel<00:04:33.879> and<00:04:34.030> throw<00:04:34.599> a<00:04:34.629> few

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
outside of the barrel and throw a few

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.189 
outside of the barrel and throw a few
extra<00:04:35.229> around<00:04:35.379> the<00:04:35.560> greenhouse<00:04:35.949> to<00:04:36.129> try<00:04:36.310> to

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 
extra around the greenhouse to try to

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:40.230 
extra around the greenhouse to try to
understand<00:04:38.340> you<00:04:39.340> know<00:04:39.460> exactly<00:04:39.759> what<00:04:40.120> the

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
understand you know exactly what the

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.999 
understand you know exactly what the
temperatures<00:04:40.690> are<00:04:40.900> how<00:04:41.229> hot<00:04:41.440> they're<00:04:41.680> getting

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:42.009 
temperatures are how hot they're getting

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:43.290 
temperatures are how hot they're getting
how<00:04:42.129> well<00:04:42.370> they're<00:04:42.550> holding<00:04:42.849> heat<00:04:43.030> things

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
how well they're holding heat things

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.140 
how well they're holding heat things
like<00:04:43.539> that<00:04:43.720> but<00:04:43.930> anyway<00:04:44.020> so<00:04:44.979> I<00:04:45.009> would<00:04:45.729> vote

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
like that but anyway so I would vote

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.640 
like that but anyway so I would vote
a-plus<00:04:46.539> if<00:04:46.750> you<00:04:46.840> want<00:04:46.990> to<00:04:47.050> throw<00:04:47.169> some<00:04:47.319> barrels

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
a-plus if you want to throw some barrels

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.219 
a-plus if you want to throw some barrels
in<00:04:47.860> your<00:04:48.220> hoop<00:04:48.370> house<00:04:48.580> to<00:04:48.930> capture<00:04:49.930> a<00:04:49.960> little

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:50.229 
in your hoop house to capture a little

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:51.420 
in your hoop house to capture a little
more<00:04:50.349> heat<00:04:50.530> and<00:04:50.680> hold<00:04:50.830> a<00:04:50.889> little<00:04:50.979> more<00:04:51.159> heat<00:04:51.310> in

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
more heat and hold a little more heat in

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.159 
more heat and hold a little more heat in
the<00:04:51.490> night<00:04:51.669> just<00:04:52.150> make<00:04:52.389> sure<00:04:52.509> you<00:04:52.659> get<00:04:52.810> enough

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
the night just make sure you get enough

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:58.110 
the night just make sure you get enough
to<00:04:54.750> keep<00:04:55.770> climate<00:04:56.770> the<00:04:57.250> space<00:04:57.550> you're<00:04:57.789> trying

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
to keep climate the space you're trying

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.059 
to keep climate the space you're trying
to<00:04:58.240> heat<00:04:58.479> I'm<00:04:58.900> sure<00:04:59.110> someone<00:04:59.530> online<00:04:59.740> you'll

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:00.069 
to heat I'm sure someone online you'll

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:01.770 
to heat I'm sure someone online you'll
have<00:05:00.220> some<00:05:00.400> good<00:05:00.430> calculations<00:05:01.300> as<00:05:01.419> probably

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
have some good calculations as probably

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.300 
have some good calculations as probably
as<00:05:01.900> to<00:05:02.050> what<00:05:02.229> you<00:05:02.409> need<00:05:02.680> based<00:05:03.009> on<00:05:03.190> your

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
as to what you need based on your

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.330 
as to what you need based on your
climate<00:05:03.759> but<00:05:03.970> I<00:05:04.150> like<00:05:05.080> it<00:05:05.229> good<00:05:05.259> idea<00:05:05.889> I<00:05:06.099> think

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
climate but I like it good idea I think

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.589 
climate but I like it good idea I think
I'm<00:05:06.430> gonna<00:05:06.550> grab<00:05:06.729> some<00:05:06.759> more<00:05:07.090> barrels<00:05:07.419> for

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:07.599 
I'm gonna grab some more barrels for

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:10.050 
I'm gonna grab some more barrels for
next<00:05:07.840> winter<00:05:07.990> and<00:05:08.319> see<00:05:08.800> how<00:05:08.889> it<00:05:09.039> goes<00:05:09.220> thanks

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
next winter and see how it goes thanks

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.210 
next winter and see how it goes thanks
