it<00:00:21.630> was<00:00:21.689> pretty<00:00:21.900> boring<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.500> be<00:00:22.619> honest<00:00:23.100> I

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
it was pretty boring to be honest I

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.720 
it was pretty boring to be honest I
thought<00:00:24.380> we<00:00:25.380> we<00:00:25.800> found<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.130> way<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.310> win<00:00:26.400> we

competed<00:00:27.269> enough<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.289> win<00:00:28.439> but<00:00:28.710> there's<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.279> lot

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
competed enough to win but there's a lot

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.339 
competed enough to win but there's a lot

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
don't think we had that bad of a first

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.170 
don't think we had that bad of a first
period<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.430> don't<00:00:50.579> know<00:00:50.640> what<00:00:50.760> do<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.910> think

that<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.719> first<00:00:51.930> grade<00:00:52.170> was<00:00:52.320> okay<00:00:52.649> but<00:00:53.340> uh<00:00:53.870> the

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
that the first grade was okay but uh the

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.840 
that the first grade was okay but uh the
the<00:00:54.899> rest<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.710> game<00:00:55.890> maybe<00:00:56.520> wasn't<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
the rest of the game maybe wasn't the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.000 
the rest of the game maybe wasn't the
best<00:00:57.059> but<00:00:57.210> obviously<00:00:58.199> they<00:00:58.320> had<00:00:58.500> us<00:00:58.620> prepared

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
best but obviously they had us prepared

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.470 
best but obviously they had us prepared
