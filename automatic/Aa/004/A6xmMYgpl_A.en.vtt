00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.990 
like right before I've been falling
asleep<00:00:24.180> I've<00:00:24.720> been<00:00:25.710> waking<00:00:25.949> up<00:00:26.220> gasping<00:00:26.970> for

asleep I've been waking up gasping for
breath<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:28.439> think<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.710> has<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.920> do<00:00:29.010> with<00:00:29.099> all

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
breath and I think it has to do with all

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.569 
breath and I think it has to do with all
that<00:00:29.279> caffeine<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:31.040> I've<00:00:32.040> been<00:00:32.219> having<00:00:32.399> some
