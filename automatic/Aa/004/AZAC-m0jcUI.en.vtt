00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:12.760
 take 4 tubes 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.760
 from the magazine 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.150
 Start 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.960
 about 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:23.279
 here is the check or thread here 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.279
 so they don't move out 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:33.660
 four tubes on one side four 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:37.950
 tubules on the other hand take two 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:43.070
 loops from tubules here upper upper 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.070
 tubules start the right eyelet 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.090
 they are not the topic of the tube 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.329
 pass through these 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.350
 four 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.570
 we correct 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.850
 it turned out eight 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.480
 take two tubules 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.970
 we twist the string you can weave the tree 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.200
 top let's go 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.869
 cherry under his breath. 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.730
 here you can put another one 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.120
 I already pasted the tube 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:00.650
 I will substitute this for her here 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:07.790
 these four and under these four 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:07.790
 Substitute braid and you can leave it 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.660
 song under 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:53.840
 it's all we tighten tightly 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.739
 top under us 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.800
 upper 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.800
 density 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:45.220
 first row weaved 2 begin with this 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.220
 who started 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.840
 do not serve the upper width 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:20.889
 tightly pressed working strings 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.889
 such here that is 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:34.850
 the tubes are cut off at an angle 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.850
 points are increasing 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:40.009
 and weave on 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.000
 about how tightens 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:59.010
 and old people try to evenly 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:06.390
 to distribute between them 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:10.260
 about the same distance in a circle 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.260
 on the shaft do we believe 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:23.000
 substitute tubules here still here by 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.000
 one 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:49.310
 and now we weave and we connect one by one 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:49.310
 and we weave on 1 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.080
 by habit 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.210
 to the desired size bottom 

00:06:14.739 --> 00:06:18.610
 ended up increasing 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:33.990
 and up plus we get to 1 with which 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.400
 were starting 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:39.790
 set the form 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:42.220
 which we will distract raise 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:47.710
 up and continue to fly 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:51.540
 rope here is a low curb 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:53.740
 weaved how many here are four five rows 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:57.040
 can now another pattern 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:59.880
 some kind of openwork weave to be 

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:02.880
 beautiful here it turns out we have 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.880
 bottom
