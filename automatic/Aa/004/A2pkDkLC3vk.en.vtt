00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
is a ghost it's not the same effect

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.560 
is a ghost it's not the same effect
anymore<00:03:26.070> so<00:03:26.700> she<00:03:26.730> I<00:03:26.940> think<00:03:27.030> he's<00:03:27.269> also<00:03:27.390> trying

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.090 
anymore so she I think he's also trying
to<00:03:27.720> look<00:03:27.840> for<00:03:28.079> that<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.380> same<00:03:28.560> effect<00:03:28.859> again

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
to look for that the same effect again

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.819 
to look for that the same effect again
