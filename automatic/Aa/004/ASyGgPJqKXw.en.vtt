00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.619
 natural juices and debates are a 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.630
 creative way of engineers more fruit 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.939
 and vegetables but you have to know how to choose 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.369
 the right machine depending on the type of 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.630
 favorite drink is flip is undecided 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.650
 between a centrifuge a 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.380
 blender 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.029
 I went to the type of drink I prefer, I said 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.740
 What I liked about having a machine with 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.230
 allow it to make a natural juice with 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.450
 much more carrots and more liquid 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.370
 with less clothing but for me the club 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.500
 important is that the machine be very 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.180
 easy to remember why Felipe then 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.879
 Maybe it 's better if we're at the machines. 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.289
 we have here today with prices between 30 and 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.629
 180 euros 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.449
 the centrifuges make liquid and 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.520
 conserve nutrient baths as they separate 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.949
 spares the shells and investments 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.920
 we can put the whole food or 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.780
 in large pieces the greater the 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.969
 better opening because you do not lose time 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.159
 to cut the fruits and vegetables 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.260
 the size of the container 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.030
 some are small and have to be dumped 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.490
 waste and work environment 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.350
 a filter for the foam is useful for the 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.560
 sound comes out more translucent 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.540
 The biggest problem is cleaning the mount and 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.060
 removing debris is not easy 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.090
 besides experimenting with lots of fruit and 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.700
 vegetables to extract a little juice some 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.650
 centrifuges are called outdoors 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.590
 claim to conserve nutrients better 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.350
 but the difference is not significant in 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.600
 relation to centrifuges in the studio 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.299
 This has to cut the food because the 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.040
 small aperture and by default are more 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.439
 difficult to mount clean than the 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.360
 Centrifugal the normal 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.420
 blenders are cheaper than 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.130
 the centrifuges start at 20 euros 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.649
 peel the fruit and the 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.610
 vegetable field see this mind and cut 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.950
 In pieces 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.960
 but attention very hard foods such as 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.420
 Beets can be a very 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.250
 demanding for blenders has 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.380
 therefore add something natural 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.079
 Layton Water for Machine Mixing 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.989
 better the ingredients of the drink rich in 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.879
 fibers and spares some Jews have a glass 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.220
 with so much time to store in the 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.230
 refrigerator or try to work 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.120
 the blenders are easier to 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.520
 cleaning is with the washing machine 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.650
 dishwasher and wasted little fruit 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.020
 I think we 'll see the differences, let's go. 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.730
 have a pact with the same base 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.730
 of the ingredient in each of the machines 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.120
 then which of the two machines 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.950
 match what you look for if you look 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.960
 milk for those who like more sounds 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.550
 refinement as I think we get 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.560
 now they are more indicated 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:01.220
 however only slightly more difficult to 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.710
 clean as I see the loot gets two are 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.990
 good for people post some with pulp 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:09.890
 or to see kits just add the milk or 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:12.560
 yogurt and centrifuges can be a 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.550
 true challenge in cleaning up more 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.070
 on other models 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.880
 the task can be facilitated by visiting the 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.920
 our portal 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.140
 how can you find results from this 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.610
 complex a blender 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:27.500
 centrifuges and starts making drinks 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:29.330
 take into account to keep abreast of 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.610
 all our actions follow the link 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.660
