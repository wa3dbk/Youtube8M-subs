known<00:03:01.680> target<00:03:02.040> I<00:03:02.070> think<00:03:02.310> everyone<00:03:02.610> in<00:03:02.730> this

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
known target I think everyone in this

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.000 
known target I think everyone in this
group<00:03:03.000> strongly<00:03:03.360> trying<00:03:03.750> unsettling<00:03:04.230> I<00:03:04.350> think

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
group strongly trying unsettling I think

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.410 
group strongly trying unsettling I think
that<00:03:05.160> was<00:03:05.250> one<00:03:05.400> of<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.520> easiest<00:03:05.730> ways<00:03:05.940> in<00:03:06.090> 50

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
that was one of the easiest ways in 50

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.450 
that was one of the easiest ways in 50
for<00:03:06.750> me<00:03:06.780> just<00:03:07.140> get<00:03:07.260> alongside<00:03:07.440> him<00:03:07.740> it's<00:03:08.250> a<00:03:08.310> big

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
for me just get alongside him it's a big

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.070 
for me just get alongside him it's a big
two<00:03:08.610> week<00:03:08.730> right<00:03:08.910> now<00:03:09.090> so<00:03:09.360> he'll<00:03:09.840> be<00:03:09.900> watching
