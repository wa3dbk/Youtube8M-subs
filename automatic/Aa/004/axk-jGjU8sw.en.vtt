really<00:00:11.190> good<00:00:11.460> I<00:00:11.490> think<00:00:11.759> desk<00:00:12.360> or<00:00:12.599> coffee<00:00:12.809> table

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
really good I think desk or coffee table

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.720 
really good I think desk or coffee table

type puzzle or maybe even a classroom
puzzle<00:00:15.240> there<00:00:15.420> is<00:00:15.540> some<00:00:15.690> math<00:00:15.870> behind<00:00:16.139> it<00:00:16.379> what

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
puzzle there is some math behind it what

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.210 
puzzle there is some math behind it what
we've<00:00:17.340> got<00:00:17.580> here<00:00:18.000> is<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.480> board<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.470> we<00:00:20.039> have

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
we've got here is a board and we have

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.670 
we've got here is a board and we have
some<00:00:20.490> wooden<00:00:20.820> nickels<00:00:21.170> and<00:00:22.170> we<00:00:22.350> make<00:00:22.529> these

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
some wooden nickels and we make these

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.000 
some wooden nickels and we make these
wooden<00:00:22.980> nickels<00:00:23.070> they're<00:00:23.550> made<00:00:24.240> out<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.600> maple

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
wooden nickels they're made out of maple

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.730 
wooden nickels they're made out of maple
and<00:00:26.390> you<00:00:27.390> can<00:00:27.539> see<00:00:27.750> this<00:00:27.900> ahead<00:00:28.260> in<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.529> tail

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
and you can see this ahead in the tail

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.410 
and you can see this ahead in the tail
and<00:00:28.769> either<00:00:29.099> side<00:00:29.340> they're<00:00:29.580> 1/4<00:00:30.000> inch<00:00:30.150> thick

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
and either side they're 1/4 inch thick

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.650 
and either side they're 1/4 inch thick
so<00:00:30.869> quite<00:00:31.140> substantial<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:33.239> see<00:00:33.480> there

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
so quite substantial and you see there

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.180 
so quite substantial and you see there
are<00:00:33.780> nine<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.079> them<00:00:34.440> here<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.550> have

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
are nine of them here and I have

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.119 
are nine of them here and I have
arbitrarily<00:00:38.190> placed<00:00:38.460> some<00:00:39.120> heads<00:00:39.450> up<00:00:39.629> some

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
arbitrarily placed some heads up some

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.639 
arbitrarily placed some heads up some
tails<00:00:41.129> up<00:00:41.399> your<00:00:42.120> goal<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.719> collect<00:00:43.020> all<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
tails up your goal is to collect all the

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.600 
tails up your goal is to collect all the
nickels<00:00:43.829> now<00:00:44.820> here<00:00:45.510> are<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.809> rules<00:00:46.399> you<00:00:47.399> can

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
nickels now here are the rules you can

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.360 
nickels now here are the rules you can
pick<00:00:47.820> up<00:00:47.850> any<00:00:48.320> head<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.590> only<00:00:49.800> heads<00:00:50.190> you

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
pick up any head and only heads you

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.299 
pick up any head and only heads you
cannot<00:00:50.610> pick<00:00:50.850> up<00:00:50.879> tails<00:00:51.829> whatever<00:00:52.829> had<00:00:53.129> you

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
cannot pick up tails whatever had you

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.580 
cannot pick up tails whatever had you
choose<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.879> pick<00:00:54.030> up<00:00:54.270> let's<00:00:54.690> suppose<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.230> I

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
choose to pick up let's suppose that I

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.510 
choose to pick up let's suppose that I
pick<00:00:55.829> up<00:00:55.980> this<00:00:56.430> one<00:00:56.640> here<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.930> must<00:00:58.230> flip<00:00:58.739> over

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
pick up this one here you must flip over

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.939 
pick up this one here you must flip over
its<00:01:00.059> neighbors<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.379> one<00:01:01.559> has<00:01:01.710> two

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
its neighbors so this one has two

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.369 
its neighbors so this one has two
neighbors<00:01:02.300> that<00:01:03.300> both<00:01:03.510> happen<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.870> be<00:01:03.989> tails

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
neighbors that both happen to be tails

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.440 
neighbors that both happen to be tails
so<00:01:04.680> I'll<00:01:04.799> flip<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.549> head<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.240> to

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
so I'll flip that to a head and that to

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
so I'll flip that to a head and that to
the<00:01:06.540> head<00:01:07.070> now<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.100> continue<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:09.080> can<00:01:10.080> pick<00:01:10.380> up

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
the head now I continue I can pick up

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.830 
the head now I continue I can pick up
any<00:01:10.710> head<00:01:11.010> let's<00:01:11.340> suppose<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.909> pick<00:01:12.180> up<00:01:12.390> this

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
any head let's suppose I pick up this

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.310 
any head let's suppose I pick up this
head<00:01:13.400> I<00:01:14.400> flip<00:01:15.240> its<00:01:15.390> neighbors<00:01:15.780> now<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.110> only

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
head I flip its neighbors now it only

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.620 
head I flip its neighbors now it only
has<00:01:16.500> one<00:01:16.530> neighbor<00:01:17.130> once<00:01:17.790> there's<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.119> gap<00:01:18.360> this

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
has one neighbor once there's a gap this

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.510 
has one neighbor once there's a gap this
does<00:01:19.020> not<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.290> neighbor<00:01:19.650> so<00:01:19.920> I'll<00:01:20.009> flip<00:01:20.220> its

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
does not a neighbor so I'll flip its

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.230 
does not a neighbor so I'll flip its
neighbor<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:21.590> can<00:01:22.590> pick<00:01:22.770> up<00:01:22.920> any<00:01:23.100> head<00:01:23.430> let's

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
neighbor I can pick up any head let's

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.999 
neighbor I can pick up any head let's
pick<00:01:24.450> up<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:24.840> one<00:01:25.020> I'll<00:01:26.009> flip<00:01:26.250> its<00:01:26.460> neighbor

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
pick up this one I'll flip its neighbor

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.910 
pick up this one I'll flip its neighbor
I'll<00:01:29.009> pick<00:01:29.280> up<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:29.850> one<00:01:30.409> flip<00:01:31.409> both<00:01:31.710> its

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
I'll pick up this one flip both its

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.830 
I'll pick up this one flip both its
neighbors<00:01:32.400> I'm<00:01:32.610> not<00:01:32.759> doing<00:01:33.119> too<00:01:33.299> well<00:01:33.329> I'm

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
neighbors I'm not doing too well I'm

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.980 
neighbors I'm not doing too well I'm
looking<00:01:34.850> that's<00:01:35.850> okay<00:01:36.329> I'm<00:01:36.479> trying<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.840> show

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
looking that's okay I'm trying to show

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.380 
looking that's okay I'm trying to show
you<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.200> game<00:01:37.350> now<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.619> can<00:01:37.950> pick<00:01:38.130> up<00:01:38.159> this<00:01:38.490> head

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
you the game now I can pick up this head

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.160 
you the game now I can pick up this head
flip<00:01:39.750> this<00:01:39.960> one<00:01:41.119> this<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.360> head<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.869> has<00:01:42.960> no

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
flip this one this is a head that has no

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.780 
flip this one this is a head that has no
neighbors<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.740> can<00:01:43.920> take<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.250> out<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.759> a

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
neighbors I can take it out this is a

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.550 
neighbors I can take it out this is a

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
head it has no neighbors I can take it

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.069 
head it has no neighbors I can take it
out<00:01:46.759> to<00:01:47.759> pick<00:01:47.939> up<00:01:48.090> one<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.390> these<00:01:48.509> two<00:01:48.810> I'll

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
out to pick up one of these two I'll

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.080 
out to pick up one of these two I'll
pick<00:01:49.259> up<00:01:49.409> this<00:01:49.710> one<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.340> flip<00:01:50.640> this<00:01:50.820> one<00:01:51.030> over

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
pick up this one and flip this one over

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.960 
pick up this one and flip this one over
and<00:01:51.750> oh<00:01:52.079> no<00:01:52.110> it's<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.710> tail<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.369> got<00:01:53.549> them<00:01:53.759> all

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
and oh no it's a tail so I got them all

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.179 
and oh no it's a tail so I got them all
but<00:01:54.240> one<00:01:54.659> that's<00:01:55.320> pretty<00:01:55.680> good

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
but one that's pretty good

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.990 
but one that's pretty good
it<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.670> course<00:01:56.880> possible<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.719> get<00:01:57.899> them<00:01:58.110> all

and that is your goal this is made from
it's<00:02:03.899> quite<00:02:04.110> sturdy<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:04.700> used<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.820> floor<00:02:06.090> board

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
it's quite sturdy I used a floor board

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.320 
it's quite sturdy I used a floor board
material<00:02:06.780> on<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:06.990> base<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:07.799> it's<00:02:08.039> quite<00:02:08.849> quite

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
material on the base so it's quite quite

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.449 
material on the base so it's quite quite
and<00:02:09.479> rugged<00:02:09.750> almost<00:02:10.110> indestructible<00:02:10.500> and

and rugged almost indestructible and

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.309 
and rugged almost indestructible and
then<00:02:11.610> I<00:02:11.700> lasered<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.239> piece<00:02:12.480> in<00:02:12.840> this<00:02:12.959> case

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
then I lasered a piece in this case

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.349 
then I lasered a piece in this case
alder<00:02:13.769> yours<00:02:14.159> maybe<00:02:14.370> cherry<00:02:14.849> or<00:02:15.120> maple
