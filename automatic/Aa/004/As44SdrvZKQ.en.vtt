00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
little bit a little bit better way to

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.250 
little bit a little bit better way to
use<00:01:21.020> on<00:01:21.350> two<00:01:21.590> men<00:01:21.740> a<00:01:21.770> temple<00:01:22.190> wise<00:01:22.310> now<00:01:23.260> then

use on two men a temple wise now then
pinging<00:01:24.590> but<00:01:25.130> we<00:01:25.460> give<00:01:25.729> up<00:01:25.880> the<00:01:26.650> potential<00:01:27.650> of

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
pinging but we give up the potential of

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:28.899 
pinging but we give up the potential of
using<00:01:27.799> our<00:01:27.979> sheet<00:01:28.130> more<00:01:28.310> efficiently<00:01:28.640> later

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
using our sheet more efficiently later

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.910 
using our sheet more efficiently later
but<00:01:29.539> I<00:01:29.570> think<00:01:29.899> it's<00:01:30.049> worth<00:01:30.109> in<00:01:30.380> this<00:01:30.530> case<00:01:30.740> we

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
but I think it's worth in this case we

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.170 
but I think it's worth in this case we
get<00:01:31.009> to<00:01:31.130> see<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.399> es<00:01:31.520> beau<00:01:31.729> um<00:01:34.060> for<00:01:35.060> our

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
get to see the es beau um for our

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.130 
get to see the es beau um for our
acolyte<00:01:36.939> now<00:01:37.939> we<00:01:38.030> could<00:01:38.180> do<00:01:38.270> something<00:01:38.479> kind

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
acolyte now we could do something kind

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.779 
acolyte now we could do something kind
of<00:01:39.200> annoying<00:01:39.409> and<00:01:39.619> freeze<00:01:39.979> his<00:01:40.219> board<00:01:40.520> and

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789 
of annoying and freeze his board and

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:43.560 
of annoying and freeze his board and
then<00:01:41.509> force<00:01:42.079> the<00:01:42.229> sheep<00:01:42.409> on<00:01:42.590> his<00:01:42.619> next

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
then force the sheep on his next

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.399 
then force the sheep on his next
creature<00:01:44.570> that<00:01:44.689> he<00:01:44.780> was<00:01:44.899> light<00:01:45.079> which<00:01:45.289> would

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
creature that he was light which would

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:46.359 
creature that he was light which would
be<00:01:45.530> like<00:01:45.649> something<00:01:45.950> like<00:01:46.009> an<00:01:46.159> animal

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
be like something like an animal

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.249 
be like something like an animal
companion<00:01:46.820> and<00:01:47.509> we<00:01:47.630> can't<00:01:47.840> actually<00:01:47.929> deal

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
companion and we can't actually deal

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:49.749 
companion and we can't actually deal
with<00:01:48.320> any<00:01:48.619> animal<00:01:48.829> companions<00:01:49.460> although

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
with any animal companions although

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.609 
with any animal companions although
they're<00:01:50.659> kind<00:01:50.840> of<00:01:50.869> falling<00:01:51.079> out<00:01:51.170> of<00:01:51.200> fashion<00:01:51.380> I

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
they're kind of falling out of fashion I

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:52.749 
they're kind of falling out of fashion I
guess<00:01:51.740> would<00:01:51.859> be<00:01:51.890> more<00:01:52.130> like<00:01:52.280> a<00:01:52.310> piloted

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
guess would be more like a piloted

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.969 
guess would be more like a piloted
shredder<00:01:53.439> so<00:01:54.439> I<00:01:54.469> think<00:01:54.560> we'll<00:01:54.679> just<00:01:54.859> go<00:01:54.920> to

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
shredder so I think we'll just go to

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.950 
shredder so I think we'll just go to
acolyte<00:01:55.399> we're<00:01:55.759> okay<00:01:55.880> with<00:01:56.179> you<00:01:56.270> he<00:01:56.390> bows<00:01:56.719> that

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.300 
acolyte we're okay with you he bows that
I<00:01:57.049> believe<00:01:57.409> but<00:01:57.679> our<00:01:57.770> hand<00:01:57.890> is<00:01:57.979> looking<00:01:58.219> a

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
I believe but our hand is looking a

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.989 
I believe but our hand is looking a
little<00:01:58.460> bit<00:01:58.670> weak<00:01:58.850> but<00:02:00.549> using<00:02:01.549> the<00:02:01.640> frost<00:02:01.820> nova

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:01.999 
little bit weak but using the frost nova

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:06.249 
little bit weak but using the frost nova
to<00:02:03.100> get<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.189> Sheep<00:02:04.340> an<00:02:04.490> extra<00:02:04.729> turn<00:02:04.939> is<00:02:05.149> ok<00:02:05.899> but

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
to get the Sheep an extra turn is ok but

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:07.989 
to get the Sheep an extra turn is ok but
it's<00:02:06.409> um<00:02:06.679> it's<00:02:07.249> not<00:02:07.490> that<00:02:07.670> great<00:02:07.850> we

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:07.999 
it's um it's not that great we

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:09.760 
it's um it's not that great we
considering<00:02:08.390> we<00:02:09.020> have<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.259> frost<00:02:09.440> number<00:02:09.649> jim

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770

considering we have the frost number jim
suhr<00:02:09.890> combo<00:02:10.190> would<00:02:10.310> you'd<00:02:10.399> rather<00:02:10.580> do<00:02:11.500> um

suhr combo would you'd rather do um

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.680 
suhr combo would you'd rather do um
actually<00:02:13.910> I<00:02:14.060> think<00:02:14.090> we'll<00:02:14.300> just<00:02:14.330> take<00:02:14.540> the

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
actually I think we'll just take the

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.470 
actually I think we'll just take the
draw<00:02:14.870> now<00:02:15.280> it's<00:02:16.280> nice<00:02:16.430> because<00:02:16.580> his<00:02:17.000> makes<00:02:17.330> his

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
draw now it's nice because his makes his

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.380 
draw now it's nice because his makes his
bow<00:02:17.630> worse<00:02:18.550> took<00:02:19.550> me<00:02:19.670> too<00:02:19.850> long<00:02:19.880> to<00:02:20.030> see<00:02:20.240> that

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
bow worse took me too long to see that

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.460 
bow worse took me too long to see that
play<00:02:20.510> I<00:02:20.540> was<00:02:20.690> thinking<00:02:20.930> about<00:02:20.960> it<00:02:21.080> last<00:02:21.170> term

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
play I was thinking about it last term

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.720 
play I was thinking about it last term
but<00:02:21.650> I<00:02:21.680> didn't<00:02:21.950> think<00:02:22.040> he'd<00:02:22.190> actually<00:02:22.220> leave

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
but I didn't think he'd actually leave

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:34.190 
but I didn't think he'd actually leave
the<00:02:22.760> Sheep<00:02:23.030> up<00:02:23.150> like<00:02:23.300> that

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.520 

we<00:02:35.010> could<00:02:35.160> do<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:36.020> you<00:02:37.020> do<00:02:37.140> a<00:02:37.170> naked<00:02:37.349> dude

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
we could do it you do a naked dude

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.830 
we could do it you do a naked dude
instead<00:02:37.830> we<00:02:37.920> do<00:02:38.040> have<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.480> assume<00:02:39.480> we<00:02:39.599> get<00:02:39.750> off

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
instead we do have to assume we get off

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.180 
instead we do have to assume we get off
the<00:02:39.930> Acolytes<00:02:40.319> if<00:02:40.500> that<00:02:40.680> affects<00:02:41.040> your

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
the Acolytes if that affects your

the Acolytes if that affects your
decision<00:02:41.690> we<00:02:42.690> need<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:42.959> get<00:02:43.050> that<00:02:43.110> barrier<00:02:43.470> up

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.050 
decision we need to get that barrier up
we<00:02:44.010> had<00:02:44.129> a<00:02:44.160> few<00:02:44.370> games<00:02:44.519> today<00:02:44.760> where<00:02:44.970> our

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
we had a few games today where our

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.640 
we had a few games today where our
barrier<00:02:45.360> we<00:02:45.540> can<00:02:45.690> get<00:02:45.840> it<00:02:45.930> up<00:02:46.019> in<00:02:46.110> time<00:02:46.319> against

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
barrier we can get it up in time against

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.530 
barrier we can get it up in time against
a<00:02:46.940> hunter<00:02:47.940> this<00:02:48.690> did<00:02:49.140> nothing<00:02:50.150> but<00:02:51.150> I<00:02:51.209> like

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540

time to use all these expensive things
we<00:02:54.900> have<00:02:55.019> like<00:02:55.170> our<00:02:55.319> Kenyan<00:02:55.560> Tecna<00:02:55.860> barrier<00:02:59.150> it

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
we have like our Kenyan Tecna barrier it

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.210 
we have like our Kenyan Tecna barrier it
looks<00:03:00.330> like<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.450> pine<00:03:00.660> extern<00:03:01.019> barrier<00:03:01.380> I<00:03:01.620> can

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
looks like a pine extern barrier I can

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.910 
looks like a pine extern barrier I can
tuck<00:03:02.989> against<00:03:03.989> other<00:03:04.110> classes<00:03:04.470> usually<00:03:04.620> not

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
rushing to put Berry on it's just

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.580 
rushing to put Berry on it's just
against<00:03:06.480> hunter<00:03:06.720> that<00:03:06.870> you<00:03:06.930> are<00:03:07.019> ok<00:03:07.380> will<00:03:07.500> do

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
the frosting of a doomsayer it's fine

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.819 
the frosting of a doomsayer it's fine
Blizzard<00:03:11.400> is<00:03:11.519> also<00:03:11.790> fine<00:03:12.349> but<00:03:13.349> like<00:03:13.470> I<00:03:13.560> said<00:03:13.590> we

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
Blizzard is also fine but like I said we

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.020 
Blizzard is also fine but like I said we
need<00:03:13.950> a<00:03:13.980> full<00:03:14.250> turn<00:03:14.430> where<00:03:14.640> we<00:03:14.730> could<00:03:14.819> use<00:03:14.940> our

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
need a full turn where we could use our

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.870 
need a full turn where we could use our
mana<00:03:15.239> to<00:03:15.450> do<00:03:15.630> things<00:03:15.959> we<00:03:16.140> want<00:03:16.319> like<00:03:16.880> barrier

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
mana to do things we want like barrier

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.520 
mana to do things we want like barrier
um<00:03:20.299> we<00:03:21.299> could<00:03:21.450> take<00:03:21.569> this<00:03:21.690> turn<00:03:21.870> to<00:03:21.959> bear<00:03:22.140> pain

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
um we could take this turn to bear pain

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.199 
um we could take this turn to bear pain
one<00:03:22.739> forced<00:03:23.190> him<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.340> pop<00:03:23.700> Carberry<00:03:24.030> with

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
one forced him to pop Carberry with

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.780 
one forced him to pop Carberry with
something<00:03:24.480> somewhat<00:03:24.840> weak<00:03:25.489> but<00:03:26.489> it<00:03:26.640> looks

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
something somewhat weak but it looks

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.100 
something somewhat weak but it looks
like<00:03:26.819> he's<00:03:27.060> gonna<00:03:27.180> have<00:03:27.360> to<00:03:27.480> go<00:03:27.810> through<00:03:28.049> the

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
like he's gonna have to go through the

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:40.059 
like he's gonna have to go through the
barrier<00:03:28.319> at<00:03:28.380> some<00:03:28.590> point<00:03:28.799> anyways

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:48.790 

I<00:03:40.159> found<00:03:40.879> stew<00:03:41.150> it<00:03:41.209> now

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:59.020 

maybe<00:03:49.490> not

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.580 

it's<00:03:59.840> kind<00:04:00.020> of<00:04:00.050> messy<00:04:00.319> because<00:04:00.410> now<00:04:00.560> our

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
it's kind of messy because now our

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.710 
it's kind of messy because now our
barrier<00:04:00.950> only<00:04:01.160> grants<00:04:01.760> us<00:04:01.850> for<00:04:02.090> HP<00:04:02.420> because

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
barrier only grants us for HP because

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:15.920 
barrier only grants us for HP because
we're<00:04:02.810> going<00:04:02.900> to<00:04:02.959> take<00:04:03.110> two<00:04:03.319> hits

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.539 

alright<00:04:16.650> let's<00:04:16.769> just<00:04:16.919> get<00:04:16.979> the<00:04:17.100> first<00:04:17.280> barrier

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
alright let's just get the first barrier

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.180 
alright let's just get the first barrier
going<00:04:17.820> with<00:04:18.810> the<00:04:18.900> scientists<00:04:19.320> here<00:04:19.500> we'll<00:04:20.070> do

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
going with the scientists here we'll do

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.499 
going with the scientists here we'll do
a<00:04:20.220> frost<00:04:20.489> nova<00:04:20.639> doomsayer<00:04:21.120> or<00:04:21.209> something<00:04:21.419> like

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:21.509 
a frost nova doomsayer or something like

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:24.140 
a frost nova doomsayer or something like
that<00:04:21.570> and<00:04:21.720> follow<00:04:21.989> up<00:04:22.079> with<00:04:22.199> creatures<00:04:23.030> it<00:04:24.030> was

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
that and follow up with creatures it was

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.290 
that and follow up with creatures it was
kind<00:04:24.240> of<00:04:24.330> a<00:04:25.370> he<00:04:26.370> said<00:04:26.550> arcane<00:04:26.789> it's<00:04:26.940> a<00:04:26.970> little

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
kind of a he said arcane it's a little

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.400 
kind of a he said arcane it's a little
too<00:04:27.389> fast<00:04:27.570> I<00:04:27.750> thought<00:04:27.870> I<00:04:27.900> could<00:04:28.080> do<00:04:28.380> something

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
too fast I thought I could do something

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.999 
too fast I thought I could do something
better<00:04:29.780> are<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:31.080> ice-barrier<00:04:31.560> pain<00:04:31.860> was

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.009 
better are the ice-barrier pain was

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:34.340 
better are the ice-barrier pain was
better<00:04:32.190> than<00:04:32.340> that<00:04:32.520> arcane<00:04:32.910> luck<00:04:33.150> to<00:04:33.300> you<00:04:33.389> or

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
better than that arcane luck to you or

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.129 
better than that arcane luck to you or
berry<00:04:34.560> return<00:04:34.800> here<00:04:35.840> looks<00:04:36.840> like<00:04:36.930> he<00:04:37.020> had<00:04:37.110> a

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
berry return here looks like he had a

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:38.360 
berry return here looks like he had a
kind<00:04:37.350> of<00:04:37.410> slow<00:04:37.560> turn<00:04:37.740> so<00:04:37.889> we're<00:04:38.009> kind<00:04:38.130> of<00:04:38.160> happy

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
kind of slow turn so we're kind of happy

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:46.839 
kind of slow turn so we're kind of happy
with<00:04:38.430> that

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:46.849 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:49.419 

I<00:04:47.110> really<00:04:48.110> want<00:04:48.319> the<00:04:48.529> barrier<00:04:48.919> off<00:04:49.099> this<00:04:49.249> guy

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:49.429 
I really want the barrier off this guy

00:04:49.429 --> 00:04:52.359 
I really want the barrier off this guy
instead<00:04:49.610> of<00:04:49.729> the<00:04:49.789> block<00:04:50.619> but<00:04:51.619> there's<00:04:52.219> two

00:04:52.359 --> 00:04:52.369 
instead of the block but there's two

00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:53.769 
instead of the block but there's two
blocks<00:04:52.610> someone<00:04:52.879> Barry<00:04:53.089> left<00:04:53.330> so<00:04:53.419> chances<00:04:53.689> are

00:04:53.769 --> 00:04:53.779 
blocks someone Barry left so chances are

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:58.089 
blocks someone Barry left so chances are
look<00:04:53.929> at<00:04:54.050> the<00:04:54.520> block<00:04:56.229> that's<00:04:57.229> ok<00:04:57.439> we<00:04:57.559> have<00:04:57.649> Alex

00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:58.099 
look at the block that's ok we have Alex

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:01.179 
look at the block that's ok we have Alex
which<00:04:58.249> is<00:04:58.369> nice<00:04:58.520> we<00:04:58.759> have<00:04:58.849> a<00:04:58.879> lot<00:04:59.209> it<00:05:00.099> this<00:05:01.099> is

00:05:01.179 --> 00:05:01.189 
which is nice we have a lot it this is

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:03.269 
which is nice we have a lot it this is
probably<00:05:01.339> uses<00:05:01.789> removal<00:05:02.209> not<00:05:02.330> burn<00:05:02.539> though

00:05:03.269 --> 00:05:03.279 
probably uses removal not burn though

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:06.359 
probably uses removal not burn though
maybe<00:05:04.279> def<00:05:04.550> we<00:05:04.699> get<00:05:04.849> this<00:05:05.029> off<00:05:05.209> that's<00:05:05.599> on<00:05:05.779> 11

00:05:06.359 --> 00:05:06.369 
maybe def we get this off that's on 11

00:05:06.369 --> 00:05:15.110 
maybe def we get this off that's on 11
not<00:05:07.369> quite<00:05:07.580> enough<00:05:11.050> mmm<00:05:12.050> interesting

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.030 

I<00:05:15.240> guess<00:05:15.900> he<00:05:16.050> figures<00:05:16.380> he's<00:05:16.650> never<00:05:16.800> going<00:05:16.949> to

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
I guess he figures he's never going to

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.800 
I guess he figures he's never going to
get<00:05:17.160> more<00:05:17.280> than<00:05:17.430> three<00:05:17.699> Wolf's<00:05:18.090> off<00:05:18.240> unleash

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
get more than three Wolf's off unleash

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.180 
get more than three Wolf's off unleash
so<00:05:19.050> we'll<00:05:19.169> just<00:05:19.199> use<00:05:19.410> it<00:05:19.560> for<00:05:19.590> three<00:05:19.889> men<00:05:20.040> three

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
so we'll just use it for three men three

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:26.439 
so we'll just use it for three men three
damage<00:05:20.490> seems<00:05:20.760> fine

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:26.449 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:33.029 

um<00:05:27.520> you<00:05:28.520> got<00:05:28.669> the<00:05:28.759> icebox<00:05:29.120> we<00:05:29.270> can't<00:05:29.479> use<00:05:29.599> that

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:42.300 

okay<00:05:34.039> finally<00:05:34.370> something<00:05:34.639> we<00:05:34.669> can<00:05:34.729> use

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.610 

based<00:05:42.970> on<00:05:43.060> this<00:05:43.180> guy's<00:05:43.390> deck<00:05:43.660> this<00:05:43.900> could<00:05:44.320> it's

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
based on this guy's deck this could it's

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.040 
based on this guy's deck this could it's
probably<00:05:44.860> not<00:05:45.370> explosive<00:05:45.940> so<00:05:46.930> it's<00:05:47.020> probably

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
probably not explosive so it's probably

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.300 
probably not explosive so it's probably
freezing<00:05:48.570> okay<00:05:49.570> maybe<00:05:49.960> not<00:05:50.170> I<00:05:50.470> guess<00:05:51.070> you<00:05:51.160> got

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
freezing okay maybe not I guess you got

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.640 
freezing okay maybe not I guess you got
the<00:05:51.340> snapshot<00:05:51.850> off<00:05:52.030> the<00:05:52.150> web<00:05:52.330> spinner<00:05:52.650> that's

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
the snapshot off the web spinner that's

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.200 
the snapshot off the web spinner that's
the<00:05:53.770> reason<00:05:53.860> I<00:05:54.040> thought<00:05:54.190> he<00:05:54.430> wouldn't<00:05:55.120> be

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
the reason I thought he wouldn't be

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:56.460 
the reason I thought he wouldn't be
right<00:05:55.360> explicit<00:05:55.570> but<00:05:55.780> now<00:05:55.900> that<00:05:56.050> I<00:05:56.110> see<00:05:56.140> this

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
right explicit but now that I see this

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:08.330 
right explicit but now that I see this
its<00:05:56.880> most<00:05:57.880> likely<00:05:58.060> explosive<00:05:58.660> trap

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.950
