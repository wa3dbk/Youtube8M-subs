backwards and then like this go like

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:44.890 
backwards and then like this go like
this<00:03:41.080> so<00:03:42.080> that<00:03:42.500> kind<00:03:42.830> of<00:03:42.980> looks<00:03:43.220> bulky<00:03:43.900> but

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
this so that kind of looks bulky but

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.100 
this so that kind of looks bulky but
he's<00:03:45.050> still<00:03:45.290> really<00:03:45.470> cool<00:03:46.390> and<00:03:47.390> it's<00:03:47.420> fun<00:03:47.840> and
