00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
going to be a hundred percent no chance

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.340 
going to be a hundred percent no chance
of<00:00:32.730> winning<00:00:33.030> at<00:00:33.180> all<00:00:33.360> ever<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.170> was<00:00:34.260> very

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
of winning at all ever and it was very

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.979 
of winning at all ever and it was very
free<00:00:34.710> but<00:00:34.980> people<00:00:35.579> proved<00:00:35.760> me<00:00:35.880> wrong<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.300> don't

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.340 
blood I think we're overlooking the fact
that<00:01:26.000> Phoenix<00:01:27.000> had<00:01:27.240> almost<00:01:27.600> nothing<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:28.170> do

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
that Phoenix had almost nothing to do

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.430 
that Phoenix had almost nothing to do
with<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.530> match<00:01:29.150> yeah<00:01:30.150> like<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.750> mean<00:01:30.990> Justin

gave<00:01:31.680> up<00:01:31.800> a<00:01:31.830> lot<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.040> damage<00:01:32.220> opportunities

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
gave up a lot of damage opportunities

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.550 
gave up a lot of damage opportunities
because<00:01:33.090> he<00:01:33.180> was<00:01:33.300> that<00:01:33.480> Phoenix<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.230> well

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
no it's not even that you notice the

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.450

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
entire match came down to which

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.310 
entire match came down to which
Wolverine<00:01:38.940> did<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.300> otherworldly<00:01:39.840> first

yeah she sure i am at all came down to
it<00:01:43.410> basically<00:01:44.400> because<00:01:44.910> we<00:01:45.120> kill<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.870> other

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
it basically because we kill the other

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.719

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
even like coquito even though he had

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.860 
even like coquito even though he had
Phoenix<00:01:49.950> on<00:01:50.280> his<00:01:50.880> team<00:01:51.120> he<00:01:51.300> burned<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.630> level

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
Phoenix on his team he burned a level

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.050 
Phoenix on his team he burned a level
one<00:01:52.020> right<00:01:52.680> like<00:01:53.220> factory<00:01:53.640> had<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.820> killer

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
one right like factory had a killer

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.180 
one right like factory had a killer
right<00:01:54.300> so<00:01:54.630> dark<00:01:55.110> phoenix<00:01:55.320> was<00:01:55.620> almost<00:01:55.950> not

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
from this game I think that like um if

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.350 
from this game I think that like um if
you<00:02:43.140> look<00:02:43.290> at<00:02:43.410> it<00:02:43.440> in<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.709> context<00:02:44.220> of<00:02:44.360> super

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
you look at it in the context of super

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.990 
you look at it in the context of super
and<00:02:45.660> Vanilla's<00:02:46.440> metagame<00:02:47.010> balance<00:02:47.459> then<00:02:47.730> yeah

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
and Vanilla's metagame balance then yeah

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.090 
and Vanilla's metagame balance then yeah
he<00:02:48.269> was<00:02:48.390> nerfed<00:02:48.630> why<00:02:49.380> I<00:02:49.410> think<00:02:49.590> if<00:02:49.680> you<00:02:49.769> look<00:02:49.950> at

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
he was nerfed why I think if you look at

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.100 
he was nerfed why I think if you look at
it<00:02:50.130> like<00:02:50.459> I'm<00:02:50.700> in<00:02:50.940> terms<00:02:51.600> of<00:02:51.750> like<00:02:51.930> new
