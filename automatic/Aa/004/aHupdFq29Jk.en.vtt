00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
resources after that you're going to

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.080 
resources after that you're going to
head<00:00:40.350> on<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.620> this<00:00:40.800> little<00:00:41.340> kind<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:41.940> thing

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
head on to this little kind of thing

just to cover the door and again adds
definition<00:00:43.620> it's<00:00:44.010> turning<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.309> flat<00:00:44.520> wall<00:00:44.670> into

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
definition it's turning a flat wall into

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.850 
definition it's turning a flat wall into
a<00:00:45.000> not<00:00:45.300> flat<00:00:45.570> wall<00:00:45.809> you'll<00:00:46.289> make<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.410> gravel

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
a not flat wall you'll make a gravel

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.319 
a not flat wall you'll make a gravel
pathway<00:00:47.280> here<00:00:47.460> just<00:00:47.640> kind<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.850> randomly

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
pathway here just kind of randomly

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.670 
pathway here just kind of randomly
spaced<00:00:48.629> them<00:00:48.840> out<00:00:48.899> don't<00:00:49.140> make<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.350> look<00:00:49.530> like

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
spaced them out don't make it look like

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.740 
spaced them out don't make it look like
it's<00:00:49.890> supposed<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.250> be<00:00:50.340> anything<00:00:50.850> otherwise

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
couple actually here on the outside and

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.889 
couple actually here on the outside and
that<00:00:55.710> will<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.910> will<00:00:56.969> make<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:57.629> it's<00:00:57.750> not

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
that will that will make it so it's not

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.029 
that will that will make it so it's not
also<00:00:58.050> in<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.260> straight<00:00:58.500> line<00:00:58.680> which<00:00:58.890> it

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
also in a straight line which it

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.410 
also in a straight line which it
currently<00:00:59.370> is<00:01:01.940> alright<00:01:02.940> we're<00:01:03.059> all<00:01:03.149> it's

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
symmetrical don't make a perfect square

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.130 
symmetrical don't make a perfect square
try<00:01:08.400> not<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.580> have<00:01:08.700> any<00:01:08.729> perfect<00:01:09.060> corners<00:01:09.570> like

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
try not to have any perfect corners like

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.420 
try not to have any perfect corners like
that<00:01:10.170> one<00:01:10.560> there<00:01:10.770> would<00:01:10.860> just<00:01:11.100> was<00:01:11.220> for<00:01:11.400> a

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
that one there would just was for a

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.969 
that one there would just was for a
second<00:01:11.760> because<00:01:12.380> Lakes<00:01:13.380> don't<00:01:13.650> generally

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
second because Lakes don't generally

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.350 
second because Lakes don't generally
form<00:01:14.189> like<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.760> we<00:01:14.939> want<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.270> look

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
form like that and we want it to look

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.910 
form like that and we want it to look
