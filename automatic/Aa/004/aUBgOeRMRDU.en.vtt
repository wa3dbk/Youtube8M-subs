00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.970
 good these hominids to a new video 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.400
 good first of all before saying 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.950
 the news that we are going to comment and other 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.900
 today you will see a news item that is not 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.490
 news is neither a rumor nor anything by the 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.919
 basically everything has started with 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.590
 a one-page opinion article in 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:20.800
 which basically I would like 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.270
 my big theft auto ' 6 out in portland 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.050
 then I'm already seeing headlines in 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.860
 many gta 6 magazines 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.289
 could possibly bellies in 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.360
 portland or will be set in portland 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.219
 everything comes from an opinion article of mine 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.960
 it's not a rumor or anything like that 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:37.089
 make my fucking case the news that 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.769
 see today grand theft auto ' 6 of which 

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:40.210
 they will be by lan because they basically come 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:42.999
 of an opinion article is that it is not 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.010
 neither rumor nor anything is an opinion of a 

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:47.170
 Uncle who has been spreading and good 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.170
 It has been good in the typical word of mouth 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.079
 that ultimately ends badly is that 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.960
 I see headlines a little bit disgusting 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.249
 how good they put great photos 6 could 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.710
 set up in portland 

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:02.530
 as already assuring saying it is a 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.230
 Roman when it's a simple opinion but 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:09.970
 well basically it seems that it's not 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:12.490
 it's just good we go to what 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.610
 let's go gta 5 has already managed to sell 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.010
 40 million copies this has been 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.530
 thank you very much you will think with the 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.090
 exit of companies are 4 and xbox then 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.880
 There will be sold enough if it is like that but 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.580
 amps and they are 3 and xbox 360 has continued 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.250
 selling hatred as sales are 19 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.580
 like to 24 million in playstation 3 in 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.350
 the one that I showed 60 17 79 million in place 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.190
 and there are four there is a huge difference 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:42.430
 with equipment with 473 million and in xbox 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.980
 one 181 million and still needs to come out 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.630
 I started on January 27 we are before 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.390
 a game that is selling a quantity 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.000
 abysmal and what point it is 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.950
 totally awesome in this be great 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.560
 photo 5 and 40 million units in 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.990
 everyone and what is the truth 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.060
 I hope I started then it's over 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.310
 selling then also a few 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.520
 millions the truth surely very 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.630
 probably and is that this is quite 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.160
 flippant not in people already had it 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.149
 companies between good that 60 others will be 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.050
 has ended up catching in next 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.190
 generation 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.020
 and surely you will end up getting caught 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.360
 I started to also that is, there are people who 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.030
 will have two copies of great devotee 5 in me 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.770
 case in fact but as the 8 to record 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.960
 and others but there are many people who 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.320
 as I say it has game twice or 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.170
 we could say it 's the game that 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.000
 more quickly its 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.710
 remastering or more more people the 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.320
 buy twice of all we could 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:39.870
 say now if we could make a 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.490
 a survey or something ever of how much 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.170
 people have bought it again but 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.300
 good as I say by their authors is missing 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.280
 let fish come out and we will see even more 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.380
 copies sold 40 million is a whore 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.150
 the fashion variety I say so then 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.220
 declared that is to continue selling games 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.580
 flippant and will go on and on and on 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.530
 selling surely so good nothing 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.870
 more kids I do not know what you think about these 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.970
 sales I think that in deserved in 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.590
 certain place others will think that the game 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.050
 is overrated and the rest is the game 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.640
 Well really, it 's very good and good 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.360
 nothing guys see you in the next 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.360
