those<00:00:20.520> blades<00:00:21.050> up<00:00:22.050> off<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:23.070> windshield<00:00:23.550> and

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
those blades up off the windshield and

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.000 
those blades up off the windshield and
you<00:00:26.580> can<00:00:26.670> see<00:00:26.849> there<00:00:26.970> was<00:00:27.500> some<00:00:28.500> tape<00:00:28.740> use

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
you can see there was some tape use

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.010 
you can see there was some tape use
there<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:29.699> we're<00:00:29.820> gonna<00:00:29.910> get<00:00:30.090> rid<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.510> and
