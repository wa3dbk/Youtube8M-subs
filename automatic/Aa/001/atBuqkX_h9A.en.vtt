 This game came out in September 2009 and 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.250
 deserved the gratitude of many 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.130
 hack and slash lovers 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.649
 arpeggios and by the way many developers 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.530
 games participated in the creation of a series of diablo 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.110
 at first glance itâ€™s still the same diablo 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.489
 the beginning of the game we can choose 1 of 3 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.160

 conqueror conqueror or alchemist 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.739
 but I think you understand how each of them 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.850

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.100

 a bunch of arrows 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.430
 but the alchemist uses magic in order 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.000

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.150
 after turning the poor monsters stuffing 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.259
 you will collect copiously you falling 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.600
 weapons 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.720
 which can be sawed on in order 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.790
 kill even more after raising 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.840
 level you can distribute points 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.090
 characteristics 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.930
 and also learn some skill 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.799
 to quickly kill vrazhin shorter 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.799
 everything is standard 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.810
 your bloody wanderings you will be 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.490
 help your favorite sputnik on whom 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.750
 By the way, you can throw a part 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.300
 loot 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.940
 so as not to drag everything in your back 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.830
 unnecessary things can be sold and the necessary 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.930
 buy 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.110
 Also in the game, you can perform tasks but 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.399
 they are not very interesting killed then 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.550
 bring that 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.160
 but boring damn yes even though the ottoman we are not 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.739
 quests here do come and if you 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.390
 you want something sweet you can 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.070
 purchase portal scroll 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.670
 who will send you some 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:28.880
 dungeon there you take a good steam bath 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.250
 Matyugs will be many but you can knock out 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.870
 some cool little thing food 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.140
 I recommend to play at a high level 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.540
 difficulties are so much more interesting 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.820
 graphics in the game simpotnaya and even something 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.550
 reminds world of warcraft 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.920
 even though they are level generated 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.800
 consist of separate blanks which 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.060
 made by hand on locations will be many 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.370
 interactive objects 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.010
 for example levers opening passage to 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:59.600
 treasure or retractable bridges 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:01.900
 just in the game, seven types of locations and so 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.610
 if you come home after work day 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.100
 tired of bosses and other tinsel 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.890
 You want to relax and let off steam then 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.410
 this game is for you and also it will help 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.650
 brighten up lonely evenings in anticipation 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:18.530
