steps<00:00:09.240> on<00:00:09.450> how<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:09.599> use<00:00:09.809> it<00:00:10.429> so<00:00:11.429> this<00:00:11.849> one<00:00:12.059> I

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
steps on how to use it so this one I

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.970 
steps on how to use it so this one I
picked<00:00:12.420> up<00:00:12.660> now<00:00:12.870> this<00:00:13.019> is<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.170> heavy-duty<00:00:13.530> one<00:00:13.920> I

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
picked up now this is a heavy-duty one I

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.470 
picked up now this is a heavy-duty one I
really<00:00:14.190> like<00:00:14.460> this<00:00:14.639> because<00:00:14.820> it<00:00:15.210> has<00:00:15.299> an

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
really like this because it has an

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.540 
really like this because it has an
adjustable<00:00:15.870> handle<00:00:16.199> that'll<00:00:16.980> actually<00:00:17.310> push

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
adjustable handle that'll actually push

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.300 
adjustable handle that'll actually push
it<00:00:17.699> six<00:00:18.090> feet<00:00:18.480> up<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.260> in<00:00:19.470> through<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.830> toilet

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
it six feet up and in through the toilet

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.460 
it six feet up and in through the toilet
and<00:00:20.460> into<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.029> main<00:00:21.240> drain<00:00:21.630> so<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.260> first

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
and into the main drain so the first

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.550 
and into the main drain so the first
step<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.340> want<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.779> pull<00:00:24.779> out<00:00:24.930> your<00:00:25.260> rod

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
step is you want to pull out your rod

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.900 
step is you want to pull out your rod
and<00:00:25.890> we're<00:00:26.849> going<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:31.009> and<00:00:32.009> then<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.640> want<00:00:32.850> to

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
and we're going to and then you want to

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.680 
and we're going to and then you want to
set<00:00:33.210> that<00:00:33.480> rubber<00:00:34.399> bottom<00:00:35.399> into<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.329> bottom

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
set that rubber bottom into the bottom

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.209 
set that rubber bottom into the bottom
of<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.899> toilet<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.410> that's<00:00:37.590> gonna<00:00:37.710> keep<00:00:38.040> it

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
of the toilet and that's gonna keep it

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.729 
of the toilet and that's gonna keep it
from<00:00:38.300> scratching<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.989> porcelain<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.649> you

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
from scratching the porcelain and you

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.560 
from scratching the porcelain and you
wouldn't<00:00:41.010> want<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.219> use<00:00:41.280> just<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.850> regular<00:00:42.059> hand

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
wouldn't want to use just a regular hand

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.119 
wouldn't want to use just a regular hand
auger<00:00:42.870> because<00:00:43.410> you'll<00:00:43.530> actually<00:00:43.680> scratch

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
auger because you'll actually scratch

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.860 
auger because you'll actually scratch
the<00:00:44.309> porcelain<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:44.910> then<00:00:45.570> you're<00:00:45.719> going<00:00:45.809> to

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
the porcelain and then you're going to

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.750 
the porcelain and then you're going to
start<00:00:46.170> pushing<00:00:46.680> down<00:00:47.010> on<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.579> rod<00:00:49.640> until<00:00:50.640> it

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
start pushing down on the rod until it

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.490 
start pushing down on the rod until it
comes<00:00:51.149> in<00:00:51.329> contact<00:00:51.570> with<00:00:51.870> something<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.379> now

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
comes in contact with something and now

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.500 
comes in contact with something and now
it<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.280> now<00:00:53.610> we're<00:00:53.820> just<00:00:53.940> gonna<00:00:54.149> start

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
it is and now we're just gonna start

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.029 
it is and now we're just gonna start
pushing<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.320> turning<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:57.239> looking<00:00:57.800> the<00:00:58.800> rod

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
pushing and turning and looking the rod

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.029 
pushing and turning and looking the rod
pounds<00:00:59.730> up<00:00:59.940> into<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.510> toilets<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.230> true<00:01:01.530> and

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
pounds up into the toilets and true and

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.009 
pounds up into the toilets and true and
this<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.280> either<00:01:02.399> gonna<00:01:02.579> break<00:01:03.059> use<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.660> push

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
this is either gonna break use and push

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.500 
this is either gonna break use and push
through<00:01:04.320> whatever<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.979> clog<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.549> in<00:01:05.790> some

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
through whatever the clog is in some

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.570 
through whatever the clog is in some
cases<00:01:06.840> you're<00:01:07.290> actually<00:01:07.740> going<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.070> catch

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
cases you're actually going to catch

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.539 
cases you're actually going to catch
something<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.810> pull<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.229> back<00:01:10.470> out<00:01:10.710> now<00:01:11.310> this

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
something and pull it back out now this

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.240 
something and pull it back out now this
one's<00:01:11.760> really<00:01:12.030> neat<00:01:12.770> because<00:01:13.770> we<00:01:14.100> can

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
one's really neat because we can

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.390 
one's really neat because we can
actually<00:01:14.729> push<00:01:15.119> in<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:16.290> little<00:01:16.740> pin<00:01:17.040> here

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
actually push in this little pin here

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:26.620 
actually push in this little pin here
and<00:01:18.390> we<00:01:18.720> can<00:01:18.869> extend<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:20.310> handle<00:01:20.990> and<00:01:22.070> lock<00:01:23.070> it

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.480 

so<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.780> we<00:01:27.869> can<00:01:27.990> push<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.409> an<00:01:28.530> additional

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
so that we can push it an additional

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.340 
so that we can push it an additional
distance<00:01:29.880> down<00:01:30.180> into<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.509> main<00:01:30.659> drain<00:01:30.960> so

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
distance down into the main drain so

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.149 
distance down into the main drain so
just<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.650> very<00:01:31.860> unique<00:01:32.689> rod<00:01:33.689> it's<00:01:34.470> super

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
just a very unique rod it's super

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.020 
just a very unique rod it's super
effective<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.880> so<00:01:36.630> at<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:36.869> point<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:38.030> work

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
effective and so at this point it work

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.319 
effective and so at this point it work
the<00:01:39.210> students<00:01:39.750> break<00:01:39.990> loose<00:01:40.229> everything

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
the students break loose everything

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:46.000 
the students break loose everything
drain

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.500 

and<00:01:47.010> so<00:01:47.159> now<00:01:47.310> once<00:01:47.580> we've<00:01:47.729> routed<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.270> there

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
and so now once we've routed it there

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.550 
and so now once we've routed it there
we're<00:01:48.870> just<00:01:49.170> going<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.710> pull<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.250> back<00:01:50.940> up<00:01:51.560> so

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
we're just going to pull it back up so

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.290 
we're just going to pull it back up so
in<00:01:52.680> this<00:01:52.770> case<00:01:53.040> I'm<00:01:53.220> going<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.400> pull<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:53.880> here

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
in this case I'm going to pull it here

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:01.520 
in this case I'm going to pull it here
I'm<00:01:54.930> going<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.619> depress<00:01:56.250> this<00:01:56.520> pin<00:02:00.290> push<00:02:01.290> this

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
I'm going to depress this pin push this

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.680 
I'm going to depress this pin push this
up<00:02:02.450> into<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.600> handle<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.080> lock<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:05.540> and<00:02:06.540> I

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
up into the handle and lock it and I

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.880 
up into the handle and lock it and I
will<00:02:06.840> pull<00:02:07.110> this<00:02:07.259> entirely<00:02:08.009> up<00:02:09.679> and<00:02:10.679> then

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
will pull this entirely up and then

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.370 
will pull this entirely up and then
remove<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.370> so<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:11.790> want<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.150> have<00:02:12.270> a<00:02:12.380> bucket
