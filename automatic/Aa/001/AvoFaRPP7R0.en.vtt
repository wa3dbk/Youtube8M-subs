minute<00:05:13.000> and<00:05:13.180> now<00:05:13.720> they've<00:05:13.870> done<00:05:14.140> a<00:05:14.169> u-turn<00:05:14.320> to

minute and now they've done a u-turn to
I<00:05:15.120> think<00:05:16.120> if<00:05:16.240> they<00:05:16.360> start<00:05:16.660> putting<00:05:16.990> some<00:05:17.500> of

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
I think if they start putting some of

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.560 
I think if they start putting some of
the<00:05:17.680> road<00:05:17.860> tax<00:05:18.220> that<00:05:18.520> we<00:05:18.669> paid<00:05:18.910> back<00:05:19.240> into

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
the road tax that we paid back into

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.360 
the road tax that we paid back into
resurfacing<00:05:20.320> the<00:05:20.350> roads<00:05:20.620> we<00:05:21.010> did<00:05:21.190> a<00:05:21.220> lot

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
resurfacing the roads we did a lot

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.940 
resurfacing the roads we did a lot
better<00:05:21.550> off<00:05:21.790> I<00:05:22.030> think<00:05:22.210> a<00:05:22.630> lot<00:05:23.260> of<00:05:23.290> accidents<00:05:23.650> we

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
better off I think a lot of accidents we

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.800 
better off I think a lot of accidents we
hear<00:05:24.160> about<00:05:24.280> are<00:05:24.490> due<00:05:24.669> to<00:05:24.850> poor<00:05:25.090> surfaces<00:05:25.690> on
