there's the Teflon the pmc doesn't stick
to<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.680> Teflon<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:53.820> that's<00:01:54.119> great<00:01:54.329> work

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
to the Teflon so that's great work

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.389 
to the Teflon so that's great work
surface<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.500> it's<00:01:55.799> also<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.159> place<00:01:56.280> where

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
surface and it's also the place where

stick<00:02:45.940> to<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.210> roller<00:02:46.420> you<00:02:46.900> can<00:02:46.930> actually<00:02:47.140> use

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
stick to the roller you can actually use

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.320

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
a little bit of badger balm on that so

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.620 
a little bit of badger balm on that so
that's<00:02:49.510> your<00:02:49.690> spacer<00:02:50.140> and<00:02:50.740> rollers<00:02:51.630> you've

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
that's your spacer and rollers you've

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.350 
that's your spacer and rollers you've
got<00:02:52.900> two<00:02:53.530> different<00:02:53.740> designs<00:02:54.460> and<00:02:54.910> they<00:02:55.240> all

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
got two different designs and they all

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.170 
got two different designs and they all
vary<00:02:55.690> so<00:02:56.050> they're<00:02:56.200> all<00:02:56.290> slightly<00:02:56.620> different

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
vary so they're all slightly different

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.610 
vary so they're all slightly different
so<00:02:58.180> two<00:02:58.240> little<00:02:58.630> designs<00:02:59.020> that<00:02:59.470> you<00:02:59.590> can

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
got a little cutter so you can actually

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.390 
got a little cutter so you can actually
cut<00:03:07.150> a<00:03:07.390> perfect<00:03:08.170> circle<00:03:08.740> so<00:03:08.980> if<00:03:09.040> you<00:03:09.130> want<00:03:09.310> to

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.830 
cut a perfect circle so if you want to
make<00:03:09.520> a<00:03:09.550> disc<00:03:09.850> pendant<00:03:10.420> that's<00:03:10.540> fine

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
make a disc pendant that's fine

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.020 
make a disc pendant that's fine
obviously<00:03:11.140> also<00:03:11.890> you<00:03:12.130> can<00:03:12.280> just<00:03:12.430> cut<00:03:12.640> out<00:03:12.820> your

obviously also you can just cut out your
own<00:03:13.210> shape<00:03:13.630> but<00:03:14.170> this<00:03:14.260> is<00:03:14.410> a<00:03:14.440> great<00:03:14.710> way<00:03:14.980> of

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
own shape but this is a great way of

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.699 
own shape but this is a great way of
using<00:03:15.730> as<00:03:16.000> much<00:03:16.270> of<00:03:16.510> the<00:03:16.630> clay<00:03:16.870> before<00:03:17.290> it

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
using as much of the clay before it

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.910 
using as much of the clay before it

it to dry and you have a little bit of

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.060 
it to dry and you have a little bit of
sandpaper<00:03:50.680> to<00:03:51.430> sand<00:03:51.670> it<00:03:51.820> with<00:03:52.739> and<00:03:53.739> then<00:03:53.770> the

sandpaper to sand it with and then the
next<00:03:54.400> step<00:03:54.640> is<00:03:54.850> the<00:03:55.030> firing<00:03:55.360> so<00:03:56.200> you<00:03:56.290> get<00:03:56.440> a

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
next step is the firing so you get a

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.979 
next step is the firing so you get a
proper<00:03:57.190> torch<00:03:57.790> blocks<00:03:58.239> and<00:03:58.510> it's<00:03:58.630> actually<00:03:58.930> a

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
proper torch blocks and it's actually a

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.500 
proper torch blocks and it's actually a
soldering<00:03:59.500> block<00:03:59.770> it's<00:03:59.980> not<00:04:00.160> a<00:04:00.459> kiln<00:04:01.060> brick<00:04:01.360> or

soldering block it's not a kiln brick or
anything<00:04:01.660> like<00:04:01.900> that<00:04:01.959> so<00:04:02.320> it's<00:04:02.440> absolutely

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
anything like that so it's absolutely

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.310 
anything like that so it's absolutely
