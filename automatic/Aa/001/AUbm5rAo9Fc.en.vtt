00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.420
 I did not get to that point I said 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.860
 To you, where did I ask you to be? 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.890
 so to the talent 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.740
 I just arrived and it's now it's the next 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.250
 We are going to work on the front 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.940
 Your foot is fine, so it's like this time. 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.340
 to use the fantasy point is fine 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.120
 lace gives a very quiet look here 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.149
 O 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.090
 I'm going to skip the first point and I'm going 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:47.600
 pass the needle through the second, leaving 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:50.180
 open loop loop pull thrown out 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:54.760
 these bidders reports finishers 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:57.170
 making a high point okay again 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.010
 and remember that point that we left 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.730
 to do 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:05.360
 so it's okay, grandfather, turn the needle around 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:09.050
 he just there and pulls the point out 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.450
 them two concludes bidders them you 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:15.440
 made a high cross point 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:18.770
 ok again the loop on the first point 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:22.490
 go to the 2nd there is a high point 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:26.870
 normal there and back at that point that 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:29.840
 You jumped she knows how to pull it out. 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.220
 the pitchers pitch laces 2 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.730
 This is the speck that we are going to 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.820
 work on the drawing of the sock whom good 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:41.990
 again you will perform this 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:44.360
 fantasy point on the front then 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.940
 Will you do it here? 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.070
 and then you will stop the jewelry inside. 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.940
 evaluated at the front 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.310
 fantasy 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.960
 You will close working a point 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:59.270
 high for each career point 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:04.010
 and then closing 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:06.110
 this career with a slip stitch in 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.920
 the third chain you gave 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:13.069
 height here I close this career 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.650
 talent is that you are on the front 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:19.250
 the little speck 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:23.900
 Good people, we're going to work for this. 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:26.390
 also with a certain variation of 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.250
 amount of careers because if you 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.650
 have a foot 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:36.250
 I have 35 36 you work there for 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:39.360
 approximately 8 10 carreirinhos 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.700
 this way if brazil is bigger 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.890
 number of careers will increase 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.370
 then you will also have to adapt the 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.490
 that I'll leave it here to you as a 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.750
 direction is when you see that the 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:58.030
 foot is being reached or 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:01.810
 you will have to change the direction of your 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.590
 work up the leg is time to 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.280
 stop 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:10.030
 So, in this case always on your toes and 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:13.180
 saw that it is coming at the end of it 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.780
 where would the leg start then it's time to 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.720
 stop because we have to pay attention 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:22.630
 to the heel and that's what we 're going 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.040
 do it together as soon as I reach the 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.459
 here in the foot 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:31.120
 the jewel so I could already make the 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:33.430
 height needed to reach the chest 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.290
 of the foot so this is how it is in this 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:42.519
 moment that little bit of my sock who 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:45.269
 Now, what we're going to do is start the 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:48.790
 heel good 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:50.380
 usually we would work in this 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.500
 direction here is not 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.570
 look here oh would it not be here 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.970
 live your work 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:01.360
 Let's change the direction, then you will. 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:05.019
 work looking inside the 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.950
 Outside, you can not see. 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.549
 good 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:12.640
 You're going to cast me out here with me. 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:15.880
 pass the needle through the little loop and 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.200
 very low point of one pass only 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:23.680
 by the pin point and lowest point 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:26.790
 You'll do it three times as I did. 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.790
 here to whom
