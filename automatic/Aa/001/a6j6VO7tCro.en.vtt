range cards here and I'm and we talked

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:07.880 
range cards here and I'm and we talked
with<00:02:06.869> Brian<00:02:07.109> here<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.289> little<00:02:07.380> bit<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.619> he<00:02:07.680> said

what you guys are issued when you go to
the<00:02:11.340> range<00:02:11.489> right<00:02:11.790> right<00:02:12.269> as<00:02:12.780> soon<00:02:12.930> as<00:02:13.049> you<00:02:13.140> get

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
the range right right as soon as you get

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.319 
the range right right as soon as you get
on<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.769> rifle<00:02:14.130> range<00:02:14.160> about<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.150> day

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329 
on the the rifle range about a day

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:18.289 
on the the rifle range about a day
before<00:02:15.510> you're<00:02:16.140> issued<00:02:16.530> your<00:02:16.620> data<00:02:16.859> book<00:02:17.299> and

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
before you're issued your data book and

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.900 
before you're issued your data book and
that's<00:02:18.480> specifically<00:02:18.989> for<00:02:19.109> 556<00:02:20.070> although<00:02:20.880> a

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
that's specifically for 556 although a

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.620 
that's specifically for 556 although a
lot<00:02:21.239> of<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.480> data<00:02:22.079> crosses<00:02:22.620> over<00:02:23.510> we<00:02:24.510> have

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
lot of the data crosses over we have

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:25.940 
lot of the data crosses over we have
three<00:02:24.810> different<00:02:24.959> types<00:02:25.260> of<00:02:25.410> targets<00:02:25.739> in<00:02:25.890> the

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
three different types of targets in the

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.509 
three different types of targets in the
Marine<00:02:26.130> Corps<00:02:26.870> so<00:02:27.870> this<00:02:28.440> has<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.680> variety<00:02:29.489> of

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
Marine Corps so this has a variety of

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.030 
Marine Corps so this has a variety of
targets<00:02:29.760> in<00:02:30.060> it<00:02:30.209> and<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:31.680> meat<00:02:31.829> and<00:02:31.980> potatoes

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
targets in it and the meat and potatoes

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.770 
targets in it and the meat and potatoes
of<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.519> book<00:02:32.700> is<00:02:32.850> the<00:02:33.000> same<00:02:33.209> you<00:02:33.420> know<00:02:33.450> where

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
of the book is the same you know where

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.509 
of the book is the same you know where
you<00:02:33.959> where<00:02:34.350> you<00:02:34.470> think<00:02:34.709> you<00:02:34.799> brought<00:02:35.010> broke

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
you where you think you brought broke

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.390 
you where you think you brought broke
your<00:02:35.670> shot<00:02:36.109> versus<00:02:37.109> where<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.709> shot<00:02:37.920> actually

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
your shot versus where the shot actually

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.630 
your shot versus where the shot actually
went<00:02:38.900> and<00:02:39.900> you<00:02:40.350> save<00:02:40.590> all<00:02:40.739> that<00:02:40.769> data<00:02:41.100> so<00:02:41.519> that

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
went and you save all that data so that

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.880 
went and you save all that data so that
if<00:02:41.790> you<00:02:42.140> experience<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.260> same<00:02:43.290> atmospheric

if you experience the same atmospheric

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.860 
if you experience the same atmospheric
conditions<00:02:44.310> as<00:02:44.549> you<00:02:44.910> did<00:02:45.090> before<00:02:45.239> you<00:02:45.450> have<00:02:45.840> a

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
conditions as you did before you have a

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.210 
conditions as you did before you have a
reference<00:02:46.230> point<00:02:46.380> of<00:02:46.500> where<00:02:46.650> your<00:02:46.769> rounds

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
reference point of where your rounds

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.460 
reference point of where your rounds
going<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.430> impact<00:02:47.700> so<00:02:48.120> not<00:02:48.840> like<00:02:48.959> that<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:49.170> mean

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
going to impact so not like that I mean

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.259 
going to impact so not like that I mean
you<00:02:50.040> know<00:02:50.069> you<00:02:50.220> sit<00:02:50.489> down<00:02:50.579> some<00:02:50.910> night<00:02:51.090> and

you know you sit down some night and
you've<00:02:51.359> got<00:02:51.510> pages<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:51.959> pages<00:02:52.109> on<00:02:52.350> data<00:02:52.590> you

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
you've got pages and pages on data you

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.319 
you've got pages and pages on data you
know<00:02:53.250> you<00:02:53.310> can<00:02:53.489> start<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:53.819> develop<00:02:53.940> patterns

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
know you can start to develop patterns

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.240 
know you can start to develop patterns
and<00:02:54.750> things<00:02:54.840> like<00:02:55.079> that<00:02:55.290> so<00:02:55.590> you<00:02:56.040> know<00:02:56.069> just

a munition you know when it's cold what

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.430 
a munition you know when it's cold what
does<00:03:01.430> it<00:03:01.520> do<00:03:01.580> when<00:03:01.700> it<00:03:01.790> gets<00:03:01.940> cools<00:03:02.180> down

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
does it do when it gets cools down

only that you're just nice to know
especially<00:04:00.260> like<00:04:00.590> I<00:04:00.620> said<00:04:00.830> on<00:04:00.920> precision<00:04:01.250> gun

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
especially like I said on precision gun

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.330 
especially like I said on precision gun
you<00:04:02.840> know<00:04:02.930> those<00:04:03.200> barrel<00:04:03.560> lifes<00:04:03.769> and<00:04:04.100> things

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
you know those barrel lifes and things

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.660 
you know those barrel lifes and things
like<00:04:04.489> that<00:04:04.549> so<00:04:05.739> that's<00:04:06.739> one<00:04:07.040> of<00:04:07.070> them<00:04:07.280> I<00:04:07.489> think

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670

you've<00:04:07.760> also<00:04:07.910> got<00:04:08.090> a<00:04:08.120> maintenance<00:04:08.480> log<00:04:08.630> here

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
you've also got a maintenance log here

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.130 
you've also got a maintenance log here
the<00:04:08.989> maintance<00:04:09.260> log<00:04:09.350> I<00:04:09.440> don't<00:04:09.590> really<00:04:09.709> use

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
the maintance log I don't really use

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.870 
the maintance log I don't really use
kind<00:04:12.140> of<00:04:12.200> just<00:04:12.350> you<00:04:12.590> know<00:04:12.680> it's<00:04:13.370> dating<00:04:13.730> work

like this are out on the web and you can

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.080 
like this are out on the web and you can
make<00:04:23.990> these<00:04:24.140> yourselves<00:04:24.650> but<00:04:25.190> you<00:04:25.520> know<00:04:25.880> this

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
make these yourselves but you know this

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.520 
make these yourselves but you know this
kind<00:04:26.270> of<00:04:26.330> combines<00:04:26.870> it<00:04:27.050> all<00:04:27.140> for<00:04:27.380> you<00:04:27.500> and

creates a very nice package and I'd say

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.130 
creates a very nice package and I'd say
it's<00:04:30.770> definitely<00:04:30.800> worth<00:04:31.220> the<00:04:31.250> money<00:04:31.539> he<00:04:32.539> take
