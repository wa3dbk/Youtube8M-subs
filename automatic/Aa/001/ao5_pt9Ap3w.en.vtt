00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
you're in a position where you can

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.130 
you're in a position where you can
somehow<00:03:16.980> get<00:03:17.400> one<00:03:17.580> over<00:03:17.730> on<00:03:17.970> something<00:03:18.390> go<00:03:18.840> for

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
somehow get one over on something go for

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.600 
somehow get one over on something go for
it<00:03:19.290> it's<00:03:19.440> just<00:03:19.709> maybe<00:03:19.950> you<00:03:20.160> know<00:03:20.310> some<00:03:20.490> people

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
it it's just maybe you know some people

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.640 
it it's just maybe you know some people
don't<00:03:20.910> agree<00:03:21.090> with<00:03:21.270> it<00:03:21.450> I<00:03:21.660> think<00:03:22.260> a<00:03:22.320> lot<00:03:22.470> of<00:03:22.500> the

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
don't agree with it I think a lot of the

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.710 
don't agree with it I think a lot of the
cases<00:03:22.890> are<00:03:23.370> that<00:03:23.700> people<00:03:24.000> don't<00:03:24.270> agree<00:03:24.510> with

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
cases are that people don't agree with

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.080 
cases are that people don't agree with
it<00:03:24.870> because<00:03:25.020> they're<00:03:25.740> jealous<00:03:25.980> and<00:03:26.400> I<00:03:26.730> think

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
it because they're jealous and I think

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.400 
it because they're jealous and I think
that's<00:03:27.300> really<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.720> only<00:03:27.750> reason<00:03:28.290> I<00:03:28.350> could

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
that's really the only reason I could

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.190 
that's really the only reason I could
come<00:03:28.740> up<00:03:28.770> with<00:03:28.940> as<00:03:29.940> to<00:03:30.270> you<00:03:30.690> know<00:03:30.840> why<00:03:31.140> you

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
come up with as to you know why you

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.620 
come up with as to you know why you
might<00:03:31.560> test<00:03:32.190> somebody<00:03:32.640> for<00:03:32.970> having<00:03:33.300> a<00:03:33.390> game

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
might test somebody for having a game

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.570 
might test somebody for having a game

should be had of course I guess is is it
ethical<00:04:08.959> quote-unquote<00:04:09.959> is<00:04:10.140> it<00:04:10.260> right<00:04:10.500> is<00:04:10.890> it

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
ethical quote-unquote is it right is it

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.270 
ethical quote-unquote is it right is it
something<00:04:11.670> that<00:04:11.820> should<00:04:12.060> be<00:04:12.090> done<00:04:12.950> the<00:04:13.950> thing

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
something that should be done the thing

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.430 
something that should be done the thing
is<00:04:14.459> it's<00:04:14.790> the<00:04:15.000> vocality<00:04:15.570> of<00:04:15.870> these<00:04:16.049> people

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
is it's the vocality of these people

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.870 
is it's the vocality of these people
normally<00:04:16.830> if<00:04:16.919> you<00:04:17.040> were<00:04:17.070> to<00:04:17.220> give<00:04:17.400> somebody<00:04:17.640> an

all this I guess it's depending where
they've<00:05:14.630> got<00:05:14.840> it<00:05:14.990> from<00:05:15.200> if<00:05:15.590> they've<00:05:15.950> got<00:05:16.160> it

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
fact that people have it early it's

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.980 
fact that people have it early it's
really<00:05:34.729> interesting<00:05:35.000> to<00:05:35.330> me<00:05:35.360> I<00:05:35.450> think<00:05:35.570> it's

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
really interesting to me I think it's

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.779 
really interesting to me I think it's
it's<00:05:36.470> something<00:05:36.710> that<00:05:37.039> will<00:05:37.310> go<00:05:37.550> down<00:05:37.729> in

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:37.789 
it's something that will go down in

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:39.969 
it's something that will go down in
history<00:05:38.030> really<00:05:38.840> that<00:05:38.990> it's<00:05:39.169> it<00:05:39.470> was<00:05:39.590> gonna<00:05:39.770> go

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:39.979 
history really that it's it was gonna go

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:44.379 
history really that it's it was gonna go
leaked<00:05:40.370> anyway<00:05:40.820> but<00:05:42.039> yeah<00:05:43.039> it's<00:05:43.820> quite<00:05:43.970> sad<00:05:44.240> as

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:44.389 
leaked anyway but yeah it's quite sad as

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:46.240 
leaked anyway but yeah it's quite sad as
well<00:05:44.570> I<00:05:44.599> guess<00:05:44.690> cuz<00:05:45.020> it<00:05:45.139> takes<00:05:45.680> away<00:05:45.919> very

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
well I guess cuz it takes away very

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.339 
well I guess cuz it takes away very
miniscule<00:05:46.729> 'ya<00:05:46.880> from<00:05:47.210> the<00:05:47.450> the<00:05:47.840> actual<00:05:48.169> launch

miniscule 'ya from the the actual launch

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:49.750 
miniscule 'ya from the the actual launch
of<00:05:48.500> the<00:05:48.560> game<00:05:48.710> but<00:05:48.889> I<00:05:48.950> will<00:05:49.220> of<00:05:49.310> course<00:05:49.340> be
