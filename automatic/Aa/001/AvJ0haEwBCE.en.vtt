restarted<00:01:39.240> fear<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.740> know<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:40.860> guess<00:01:41.070> they

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
restarted fear and you know I guess they

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.530 
restarted fear and you know I guess they
were<00:01:41.280> keeping<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.670> name<00:01:41.820> alive<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.270> course<00:01:42.329> it

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
wasn't the same but because the players

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.670 
wasn't the same but because the players
were<00:01:44.549> they<00:01:44.670> were<00:01:44.909> they<00:01:45.390> were<00:01:45.720> still<00:01:46.020> just<00:01:46.439> as

until<00:01:54.030> I'd<00:01:54.240> say<00:01:54.390> about<00:01:54.420> yesterday<00:01:55.140> basically

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
until I'd say about yesterday basically

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.740 
until I'd say about yesterday basically
when<00:01:55.979> they<00:01:56.159> were<00:01:56.219> apparently<00:01:56.880> exposed<00:01:57.450> for

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
when they were apparently exposed for

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.620 
when they were apparently exposed for
viewbotting<00:01:58.439> their<00:01:58.770> streams<00:01:59.450> they<00:02:00.450> have

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
viewbotting their streams they have

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.649 
viewbotting their streams they have
gotten<00:02:01.079> so<00:02:01.619> much<00:02:02.040> shit<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.270> streaming

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
gotten so much shit so the streaming

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.719 
gotten so much shit so the streaming
side<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.170> apparently<00:02:04.350> they<00:02:05.310> were<00:02:05.430> view

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
side of it apparently they were view

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.370 
side of it apparently they were view
botting<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.299> they<00:02:06.600> were<00:02:06.659> doing<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:07.110> so<00:02:07.229> that

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
botting and they were doing it so that

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.660 
botting and they were doing it so that
they<00:02:07.500> could<00:02:07.649> actually<00:02:07.770> grow<00:02:08.099> their<00:02:08.369> streams

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
they could actually grow their streams

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.290 
they could actually grow their streams
to<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.879> parent

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
to the parent

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.850 
to the parent
you<00:02:09.360> know<00:02:09.479> they<00:02:09.630> were<00:02:09.690> holding<00:02:10.020> many<00:02:10.410> viewers

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
you know they were holding many viewers

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.410 
you know they were holding many viewers
they<00:02:11.460> weren't<00:02:11.580> getting<00:02:11.790> many<00:02:11.910> viewers<00:02:12.300> in

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
they weren't getting many viewers in

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.210 
they weren't getting many viewers in
general<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.080> so<00:02:13.410> this<00:02:13.560> other<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:13.950> kind<00:02:14.130> of

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
general and so this other the kind of

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.520 
general and so this other the kind of
you<00:02:14.820> bought<00:02:15.060> it<00:02:15.240> I<00:02:15.360> guess<00:02:15.600> in<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.810> sense<00:02:15.990> of<00:02:16.170> so

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
you bought it I guess in the sense of so

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.770 
you bought it I guess in the sense of so
that<00:02:16.680> they<00:02:16.800> can<00:02:17.040> grow<00:02:17.520> their<00:02:17.790> stream<00:02:18.240> of<00:02:18.450> more

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
that they can grow their stream of more

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.160 
that they can grow their stream of more
and<00:02:18.990> apparently<00:02:19.530> it's<00:02:20.100> working<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:21.600> so<00:02:21.930> keep

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
and apparently it's working and so keep

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.420 
and apparently it's working and so keep
starting<00:02:22.410> to<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.560> finding<00:02:22.890> out<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.220> he<00:02:23.280> made

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
starting to the finding out and he made

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.250 
starting to the finding out and he made
a<00:02:23.460> video<00:02:23.700> about<00:02:23.850> it<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:24.420> he<00:02:24.510> talked<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:25.230> know

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260

if<00:03:11.550> it<00:03:11.640> was<00:03:11.730> actually<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.090> sniping<00:03:12.480> side<00:03:12.660> I

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
if it was actually the sniping side I

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.440 
if it was actually the sniping side I
think<00:03:12.780> it<00:03:13.110> was<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.380> mo<00:03:13.800> g<00:03:14.040> side<00:03:14.310> of<00:03:14.459> fear<00:03:14.670> but

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
think it was the mo g side of fear but

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.050 
think it was the mo g side of fear but
the<00:03:16.140> sniping<00:03:16.920> side<00:03:17.100> was<00:03:17.250> getting<00:03:17.459> so<00:03:17.670> much

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
the sniping side was getting so much

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.960 
the sniping side was getting so much
shit<00:03:18.120> today<00:03:19.110> which<00:03:19.860> eventually<00:03:20.190> had<00:03:20.520> led<00:03:20.760> up

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
shit today which eventually had led up

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.449 
shit today which eventually had led up
to<00:03:21.150> team<00:03:21.810> fear<00:03:22.110> actually<00:03:22.560> releasing<00:03:23.190> I<00:03:23.280> guess

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
to team fear actually releasing I guess

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.220 
to team fear actually releasing I guess
the<00:03:23.640> sniping<00:03:24.060> side<00:03:24.360> of<00:03:24.510> it<00:03:24.600> meaning<00:03:25.200> that

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
the sniping side of it meaning that

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.870 
the sniping side of it meaning that
these<00:03:25.500> sniping<00:03:25.890> side<00:03:26.040> of<00:03:26.160> fear<00:03:26.310> is<00:03:26.489> no<00:03:26.670> longer

gonna keep the name fear because i'm

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.340 
gonna keep the name fear because i'm
pretty<00:03:33.000> sure<00:03:33.150> that<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.450> actual<00:03:33.660> pro<00:03:33.930> team<00:03:34.170> has

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
pretty sure that the actual pro team has

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.070 
pretty sure that the actual pro team has
that<00:03:34.560> name<00:03:35.000> trademarked<00:03:36.000> as<00:03:36.180> i'm<00:03:36.450> pretty<00:03:36.900> sure

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
that name trademarked as i'm pretty sure

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.930

they<00:03:37.200> do<00:03:37.320> because<00:03:37.470> i<00:03:37.530> think<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:37.770> reason<00:03:37.980> the

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
they do because i think the reason the

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.090 
they do because i think the reason the
team<00:03:39.120> fear<00:03:39.480> actually<00:03:40.200> really<00:03:40.440> started<00:03:40.920> and

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
team fear actually really started and

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.380 
team fear actually really started and
that<00:03:41.160> they<00:03:41.370> were<00:03:41.430> able<00:03:41.610> to<00:03:41.730> use<00:03:41.940> that<00:03:42.090> name<00:03:42.209> is

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
that they were able to use that name is

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.760 
that they were able to use that name is
because<00:03:42.660> pamaj<00:03:43.020> was<00:03:43.380> there<00:03:43.530> to<00:03:43.650> basically

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
because pamaj was there to basically

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.340 
because pamaj was there to basically
help<00:03:44.130> grow<00:03:44.520> the<00:03:45.060> sniping<00:03:45.510> side<00:03:45.720> as<00:03:45.989> well<00:03:46.230> as
