00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
this is just casting how do you know

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.870 
this is just casting how do you know
this<00:01:18.659> well<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.590> didn't<00:01:20.070> play<00:01:20.159> college<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.610> for<00:01:20.820> a

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
this well I didn't play college it for a

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.710 
this well I didn't play college it for a
while<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:22.020> don't<00:01:22.229> know<00:01:22.320> if<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.220> guys<00:01:23.340> know

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
while and I don't know if you guys know

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.960 
while and I don't know if you guys know
but<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:25.409> sort<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.890> looks<00:01:26.070> like<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.729> little

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
but it sort of looks like the little

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.219 
but it sort of looks like the little
drone<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.299> threw<00:01:27.479> up<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.750> air<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.110> it

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
drone you threw up in the air and it

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.050 
drone you threw up in the air and it
sort<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.409> bond<00:01:28.650> people<00:01:28.950> but<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.430> don't<00:01:29.820> think<00:01:29.909> it

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
sort of bond people but I don't think it

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.260 
sort of bond people but I don't think it
is<00:01:30.150> it's<00:01:30.360> just<00:01:30.829> take<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.860> little<00:01:31.979> stealth<00:01:32.460> plane

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
is it's just take a little stealth plane

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.990 
is it's just take a little stealth plane
um<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:34.079> might<00:01:34.200> be<00:01:34.350> similar<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.040> suav<00:01:35.579> but<00:01:35.970> I

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
um it might be similar to the suav but I

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.590 
um it might be similar to the suav but I
don't<00:01:36.540> think<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:36.900> it's<00:01:37.770> actually<00:01:38.600> something

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
don't think so it's actually something

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.319 
don't think so it's actually something
completely<00:01:40.350> different<00:01:40.640> I'm<00:01:41.640> not<00:01:41.759> just<00:01:42.000> to

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
completely different I'm not just to

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.719 
completely different I'm not just to
shore<00:01:42.600> as<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.869> what<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.140> does<00:01:43.320> I'm<00:01:43.740> but<00:01:44.280> once<00:01:44.579> I

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
shore as of what it does I'm but once I

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.050 
shore as of what it does I'm but once I
do<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:44.909> will<00:01:45.090> fine<00:01:45.420> I

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
do I will fine I

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.819 
do I will fine I
you<00:01:46.450> know<00:01:46.540> mentioned<00:01:46.869> you<00:01:46.960> guys<00:01:46.990> but<00:01:47.409> it

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
you know mentioned you guys but it

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:49.710 
you know mentioned you guys but it
looked<00:01:47.890> like<00:01:48.130> a<00:01:48.189> mini<00:01:48.460> UAB<00:01:48.970> that's<00:01:49.240> what<00:01:49.630> it

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
looked like a mini UAB that's what it

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.649 
looked like a mini UAB that's what it
looks<00:01:49.869> like<00:01:50.020> just<00:01:50.320> a<00:01:50.409> mini<00:01:50.649> you<00:01:50.740> lay<00:01:51.070> be<00:01:51.659> but

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
looks like just a mini you lay be but

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.880 
looks like just a mini you lay be but
yeah<00:01:53.200> in<00:01:53.770> a<00:01:53.920> smaller<00:01:54.369> version<00:01:54.579> that<00:01:54.970> the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
yeah in a smaller version that the

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.569 
yeah in a smaller version that the
operator<00:01:56.890> is<00:01:57.130> a<00:01:57.159> sniper<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.990> that's<00:01:59.500> what<00:02:00.430> I'm

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
operator is a sniper so that's what I'm

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:02.910
