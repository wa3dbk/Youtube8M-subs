barrel<00:02:01.540> right<00:02:01.780> along<00:02:02.110> the<00:02:02.200> last<00:02:02.409> crimp<00:02:02.710> that

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
barrel right along the last crimp that

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.950 
barrel right along the last crimp that
you've<00:02:02.920> created<00:02:03.100> and<00:02:03.790> that<00:02:04.479> way<00:02:04.630> you're<00:02:04.810> going

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
you've created and that way you're going

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.560 
you've created and that way you're going
to<00:02:05.049> keep<00:02:05.290> it<00:02:05.470> uniform<00:02:05.710> if<00:02:06.250> you<00:02:07.060> want<00:02:07.270> a<00:02:07.390> more

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
to keep it uniform if you want a more

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.779 
to keep it uniform if you want a more
kind<00:02:07.720> of<00:02:07.840> tousled<00:02:08.289> look<00:02:08.350> then<00:02:09.100> of<00:02:09.220> course<00:02:09.459> you

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
kind of tousled look then of course you

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.520 
kind of tousled look then of course you
don't<00:02:09.910> have<00:02:10.149> to<00:02:10.300> do<00:02:10.450> that<00:02:10.479> but<00:02:10.780> I<00:02:10.810> like<00:02:11.080> mine<00:02:11.290> to

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
don't have to do that but I like mine to

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.290 
don't have to do that but I like mine to
be<00:02:11.709> quite<00:02:12.040> defined<00:02:12.340> especially<00:02:12.880> at<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.030> front

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
be quite defined especially at the front

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.630 
be quite defined especially at the front
so<00:02:14.260> where<00:02:14.470> that<00:02:14.500> one<00:02:14.830> is<00:02:14.860> coming<00:02:15.220> out<00:02:15.370> here

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
so where that one is coming out here

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:25.680 
so where that one is coming out here
just<00:02:16.420> going<00:02:16.540> to<00:02:16.660> slide<00:02:17.020> it<00:02:17.170> along<00:02:17.260> and<00:02:24.600> as<00:02:25.600> you

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
just going to slide it along and as you

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.710 
just going to slide it along and as you
can<00:02:25.840> see<00:02:25.870> it<00:02:26.080> creates<00:02:26.380> really<00:02:26.800> quickly<00:02:27.190> and

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
can see it creates really quickly and

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.289 
can see it creates really quickly and
they're<00:02:28.720> very<00:02:28.750> much<00:02:29.310> defined<00:02:32.850> the<00:02:33.850> end<00:02:34.060> can<00:02:34.269> be

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
they're very much defined the end can be

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.059 
they're very much defined the end can be
a<00:02:34.420> little<00:02:34.569> bit<00:02:34.750> tricky<00:02:35.080> because<00:02:35.200> you<00:02:35.470> run<00:02:35.980> out

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
a little bit tricky because you run out

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.470 
a little bit tricky because you run out
of<00:02:36.100> hair<00:02:36.400> but<00:02:36.670> then<00:02:36.819> you<00:02:36.910> don't<00:02:37.090> want<00:02:37.269> to<00:02:37.330> leave

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
of hair but then you don't want to leave

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.840 
of hair but then you don't want to leave
it<00:02:37.630> to<00:02:37.900> straight<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:38.560> it's<00:02:39.220> quite<00:02:39.400> a<00:02:39.430> modern

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
it to straight and it's quite a modern

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.460 
it to straight and it's quite a modern
way<00:02:39.970> to<00:02:40.000> do<00:02:40.269> it<00:02:40.420> to<00:02:40.540> leave<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:40.810> end<00:02:40.989> astray<00:02:41.290> but

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
way to do it to leave the end astray but

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.500 
way to do it to leave the end astray but
I<00:02:41.530> quite<00:02:41.830> like<00:02:42.010> to<00:02:42.040> put<00:02:42.730> at<00:02:42.940> least<00:02:42.970> a<00:02:43.330> little

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
I quite like to put at least a little

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.600 
I quite like to put at least a little
bit<00:02:43.720> of<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:43.900> Crump<00:02:44.170> at<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.410> end<00:02:44.530> so<00:02:45.220> that's<00:02:45.430> the

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
bit of a Crump at the end so that's the

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.820 
bit of a Crump at the end so that's the
fasten<00:02:45.970> few<00:02:46.299> did<00:02:46.630> a<00:02:46.660> little<00:02:46.900> pin<00:02:47.200> here<00:02:47.590> it

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
fasten few did a little pin here it

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.949 
fasten few did a little pin here it
would<00:02:47.950> make<00:02:48.130> a<00:02:48.160> great<00:02:48.370> 20th<00:02:49.330> kind<00:02:49.690> of<00:02:49.810> look

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
would make a great 20th kind of look

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.030 
would make a great 20th kind of look
what<00:02:50.140> I<00:02:50.170> used<00:02:50.380> to<00:02:50.410> do<00:02:50.560> their<00:02:50.709> hair<00:02:50.860> like<00:02:51.010> that

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
what I used to do their hair like that

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.590 
what I used to do their hair like that
but<00:02:51.370> of<00:02:51.459> course<00:02:51.670> before<00:02:51.970> these<00:02:52.150> do<00:02:52.420> it<00:02:52.480> with

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
but of course before these do it with

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.289 
but of course before these do it with
pins<00:02:52.870> now<00:02:53.799> it<00:02:54.160> just<00:02:54.220> a<00:02:54.459> few<00:02:54.640> seconds<00:02:55.060> you<00:02:55.150> get

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
pins now it just a few seconds you get

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.660 
pins now it just a few seconds you get
back<00:02:55.739> so<00:02:56.739> I'm<00:02:56.799> going<00:02:56.859> to<00:02:57.010> do<00:02:57.160> another<00:02:57.280> section

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
back so I'm going to do another section

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.110 
back so I'm going to do another section
here<00:02:57.880> just<00:02:58.060> to<00:02:58.180> show<00:02:58.329> you<00:02:58.359> once<00:02:59.140> again<00:02:59.290> quite<00:03:00.010> a

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
here just to show you once again quite a

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.190 
here just to show you once again quite a
wide<00:03:01.120> section<00:03:01.600> but<00:03:02.049> quite<00:03:02.380> flat<00:03:03.989> and<00:03:04.989> then

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
wide section but quite flat and then

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.569 
wide section but quite flat and then
we're<00:03:05.350> just<00:03:05.380> going<00:03:05.560> to<00:03:05.650> go<00:03:05.769> over<00:03:05.799> in<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.370> roots

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
we're just going to go over in the roots

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:11.000 
we're just going to go over in the roots
and<00:03:08.070> then<00:03:09.070> just<00:03:09.250> move<00:03:09.370> down<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:09.790> hair<00:03:09.970> and<00:03:10.269> the

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
and then just move down the hair and the

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.229 
and then just move down the hair and the
thinning<00:03:12.010> section<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.489> faster<00:03:12.820> you<00:03:12.910> can<00:03:12.940> move

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
thinning section the faster you can move

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.380 
thinning section the faster you can move
down<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:13.720> hair<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:14.140> of<00:03:14.799> course<00:03:15.060> you<00:03:16.060> can<00:03:16.209> put

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
down the hair and of course you can put

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.240 
down the hair and of course you can put
it<00:03:16.480> on<00:03:16.600> a<00:03:16.630> higher<00:03:17.290> heat<00:03:17.650> setting<00:03:18.040> if<00:03:18.130> you're

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
it on a higher heat setting if you're

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:26.080 
it on a higher heat setting if you're
finding<00:03:18.459> it's<00:03:18.760> not<00:03:18.940> as<00:03:19.060> defined<00:03:19.420> as<00:03:19.570> you<00:03:19.690> like

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.130 

I<00:03:27.400> like<00:03:28.400> to<00:03:28.430> make<00:03:28.640> my<00:03:28.700> sections<00:03:29.269> as<00:03:29.450> wide<00:03:29.870> as

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
I like to make my sections as wide as

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.080 
I like to make my sections as wide as
the<00:03:30.290> plate<00:03:30.500> because<00:03:30.950> you<00:03:31.099> have<00:03:31.280> all<00:03:31.849> that

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
the plate because you have all that

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.750 
the plate because you have all that
space<00:03:32.300> there<00:03:32.750> and<00:03:33.019> it<00:03:33.110> just<00:03:33.430> makes<00:03:34.430> you<00:03:34.610> get

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
space there and it just makes you get

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.720 
space there and it just makes you get
the<00:03:34.849> look<00:03:35.000> much<00:03:35.239> faster<00:03:36.069> if<00:03:37.069> your<00:03:37.280> sections

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
the look much faster if your sections

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.059 
the look much faster if your sections
are<00:03:37.879> wider<00:03:41.170> so<00:03:42.170> as<00:03:42.260> you<00:03:42.379> can<00:03:42.470> see<00:03:42.620> it's<00:03:42.769> really

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
are wider so as you can see it's really

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.729 
are wider so as you can see it's really
really<00:03:43.489> easy<00:03:43.519> to<00:03:43.940> create<00:03:44.120> this<00:03:44.330> look<00:03:44.390> and<00:03:44.900> just

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
really easy to create this look and just

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.460 
really easy to create this look and just
less<00:03:46.580> than<00:03:46.610> a<00:03:46.849> minute<00:03:47.030> probably<00:03:47.540> I've<00:03:47.870> done

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
less than a minute probably I've done

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.289 
less than a minute probably I've done
two<00:03:48.709> big<00:03:48.890> sections<00:03:49.370> that<00:03:49.610> cover<00:03:49.910> quite<00:03:50.239> a

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
two big sections that cover quite a

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.930 
two big sections that cover quite a
large<00:03:50.599> part<00:03:50.930> of<00:03:50.989> my<00:03:51.080> hair<00:03:51.410> so<00:03:52.099> I'm<00:03:52.400> just<00:03:52.819> going

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
large part of my hair so I'm just going

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.100 
large part of my hair so I'm just going
to<00:03:53.000> carry<00:03:53.239> off<00:03:53.390> doing<00:03:53.629> that<00:03:53.660> off<00:03:53.840> camera

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
to carry off doing that off camera

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.270 
to carry off doing that off camera
because<00:03:54.500> I'm<00:03:54.620> going<00:03:54.709> to<00:03:54.769> be<00:03:54.860> doing<00:03:55.010> exactly

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
because I'm going to be doing exactly

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.009 
because I'm going to be doing exactly
the<00:03:55.489> same<00:03:55.549> thing<00:03:55.910> and<00:03:56.150> then<00:03:56.390> I'm<00:03:56.510> gonna<00:03:56.690> come

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
the same thing and then I'm gonna come
