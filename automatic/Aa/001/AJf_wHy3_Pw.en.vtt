at the booth of bozer and it's a

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.380 
at the booth of bozer and it's a
must-see<00:00:17.900> a<00:00:18.380> must<00:00:18.770> have<00:00:19.130> these<00:00:19.849> systems

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
must-see a must have these systems

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.819 
must-see a must have these systems
really<00:00:21.220> comfortable<00:00:22.660> not<00:00:23.660> heavy<00:00:23.989> very<00:00:24.559> light

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:24.829 
really comfortable not heavy very light

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:29.139 
really comfortable not heavy very light
great<00:00:25.640> sounds<00:00:26.000> and<00:00:26.380> we<00:00:27.380> have<00:00:27.590> here<00:00:28.279> the<00:00:28.759> system

00:00:29.139 --> 00:00:29.149 
great sounds and we have here the system

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:33.450 
great sounds and we have here the system
it<00:00:29.360> seems<00:00:29.599> to<00:00:29.809> be<00:00:29.930> the<00:00:30.079> l1<00:00:30.969> sb2<00:00:31.969> yeah<00:00:32.540> this<00:00:33.140> is<00:00:33.320> a

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
it seems to be the l1 sb2 yeah this is a

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.000 
it seems to be the l1 sb2 yeah this is a
perfect<00:00:34.460> bite<00:00:34.640> hard<00:00:34.910> perfect<00:00:35.870> so<00:00:36.379> this<00:00:36.590> is<00:00:36.620> an

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
perfect bite hard perfect so this is an

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.880 
perfect bite hard perfect so this is an
hour<00:00:37.510> we<00:00:38.510> say<00:00:38.690> this<00:00:38.870> is<00:00:38.960> our<00:00:39.080> performance<00:00:39.740> and

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
hour we say this is our performance and

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.130 
hour we say this is our performance and
mobility<00:00:40.180> package<00:00:41.180> here<00:00:41.420> what<00:00:41.630> we<00:00:41.750> see<00:00:41.900> here

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
mobility package here what we see here

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.410 
mobility package here what we see here
because<00:00:42.650> this<00:00:42.890> combines<00:00:43.310> high<00:00:43.940> grade<00:00:44.240> of

from the upper eyes to the mid-range to
the<00:00:50.450> lower<00:00:50.600> space<00:00:50.930> what<00:00:51.590> makes<00:00:51.829> this<00:00:52.040> system

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
the lower space what makes this system

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.729 
the lower space what makes this system
so<00:00:52.550> special<00:00:52.970> you<00:00:53.090> invented<00:00:53.720> this<00:00:54.110> portable

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
so special you invented this portable

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.520 
so special you invented this portable
line<00:00:55.040> array<00:00:55.310> system<00:00:55.640> many<00:00:56.300> years<00:00:56.570> ago<00:00:56.750> so

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
line array system many years ago so

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.490 
line array system many years ago so
you're<00:00:58.190> in<00:00:58.430> a<00:00:58.520> pole<00:00:58.760> position<00:00:59.329> but<00:00:59.690> still<00:01:00.020> well

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
you're in a pole position but still well

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.509 
you're in a pole position but still well
yes<00:01:00.829> a<00:01:01.239> comfortable<00:01:02.239> situation<00:01:02.360> thank<00:01:02.960> you<00:01:03.170> um

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
yes a comfortable situation thank you um

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:06.280 
yes a comfortable situation thank you um
just<00:01:04.540> what's<00:01:05.540> what<00:01:05.750> makes<00:01:05.960> the<00:01:06.140> system

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
just what's what makes the system

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.219 
just what's what makes the system
special<00:01:06.950> first<00:01:07.790> I<00:01:07.970> would<00:01:08.030> say<00:01:08.360> there<00:01:08.899> is<00:01:09.020> as

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
special first I would say there is as

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.709 
special first I would say there is as
far<00:01:09.950> as<00:01:10.069> I<00:01:10.159> can<00:01:10.219> see<00:01:10.429> this<00:01:10.789> nothing<00:01:11.539> in<00:01:11.630> the

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:11.719 
far as I can see this nothing in the

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:14.289 
far as I can see this nothing in the
market<00:01:12.079> that<00:01:12.170> combines<00:01:12.679> this<00:01:13.490> high<00:01:13.759> grade<00:01:14.090> of

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
market that combines this high grade of

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.859 
market that combines this high grade of
mobility<00:01:14.869> easy<00:01:15.679> transport<00:01:16.429> easy<00:01:16.759> Sarah<00:01:17.270> with

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
mobility easy transport easy Sarah with

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.080 
mobility easy transport easy Sarah with
such<00:01:18.049> a<00:01:18.079> performance<00:01:18.679> so<00:01:19.369> if<00:01:19.549> you<00:01:19.700> look<00:01:19.819> here

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
such a performance so if you look here

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.899 
such a performance so if you look here
at<00:01:20.299> some<00:01:20.719> like<00:01:20.959> some<00:01:21.679> figures<00:01:22.069> with<00:01:22.700> that

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
at some like some figures with that

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:24.609 
at some like some figures with that
system<00:01:23.179> here<00:01:23.600> in<00:01:23.780> combination<00:01:24.350> with<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:24.469> B

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
system here in combination with the B

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.340 
system here in combination with the B
tool<00:01:24.829> you<00:01:24.979> can<00:01:25.159> easily<00:01:25.569> entertained<00:01:26.569> up<00:01:27.079> to

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
tool you can easily entertained up to

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.219 
tool you can easily entertained up to
300<00:01:27.979> people<00:01:28.369> but<00:01:28.999> if<00:01:29.299> you<00:01:29.509> look<00:01:29.630> to<00:01:29.780> the<00:01:29.810> system

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
300 people but if you look to the system

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.919 
300 people but if you look to the system
here<00:01:30.439> you<00:01:30.920> come<00:01:31.130> like<00:01:31.729> chance<00:01:32.209> parties<00:01:32.689> like

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:32.929 
here you come like chance parties like

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:33.670 
here you come like chance parties like
now

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
now

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.310 
now
it<00:01:33.980> takes<00:01:34.340> you<00:01:34.460> two<00:01:34.670> minutes<00:01:35.060> to<00:01:35.960> break<00:01:36.110> down

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
it takes you two minutes to break down

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.010 
it takes you two minutes to break down
the<00:01:36.380> system<00:01:36.740> and<00:01:37.100> transport<00:01:37.940> gets<00:01:38.810> in<00:01:38.960> a

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
the system and transport gets in a

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.140 
the system and transport gets in a
fraction<00:01:39.260> of<00:01:39.500> the<00:01:39.560> time<00:01:39.650> so<00:01:40.520> these<00:01:40.880> line

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
fraction of the time so these line

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.110 
fraction of the time so these line
arrays<00:01:41.450> are<00:01:41.840> very<00:01:42.650> special<00:01:43.040> and<00:01:43.460> transporting

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.120 
arrays are very special and transporting

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.980 
arrays are very special and transporting
sound<00:01:44.480> from<00:01:45.080> one<00:01:45.290> point<00:01:46.010> to<00:01:46.370> another<00:01:46.840> what<00:01:47.840> is

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
sound from one point to another what is

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.110 
sound from one point to another what is
the<00:01:48.200> goal<00:01:48.410> what's<00:01:48.680> the<00:01:48.979> secret<00:01:49.520> behind<00:01:49.640> that

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
the goal what's the secret behind that

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.140 
the goal what's the secret behind that
well<00:01:50.360> I<00:01:50.660> think<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:51.410> most<00:01:52.220> important<00:01:52.700> part<00:01:52.910> of

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
well I think the most important part of

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.350 
well I think the most important part of
such<00:01:53.630> a<00:01:53.660> system<00:01:53.960> of<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.500> l1<00:01:54.860> is<00:01:54.890> and<00:01:55.460> the

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
such a system of the l1 is and the

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.170 
such a system of the l1 is and the
acoustic<00:01:56.960> behavior<00:01:57.500> so<00:01:58.160> what<00:01:58.340> you<00:01:58.460> get<00:01:58.580> is<00:01:58.850> you

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
acoustic behavior so what you get is you

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.300 
acoustic behavior so what you get is you
have<00:01:59.330> a<00:01:59.360> wide<00:01:59.780> angle<00:02:00.110> and<00:02:00.619> sound<00:02:00.890> dispersion

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
have a wide angle and sound dispersion

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.219 
have a wide angle and sound dispersion
of<00:02:01.520> almost<00:02:01.820> hundred<00:02:02.270> eighty<00:02:02.479> degrees<00:02:02.600> and

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
of almost hundred eighty degrees and

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.170 
of almost hundred eighty degrees and
this<00:02:03.770> is<00:02:03.920> like<00:02:04.100> unique<00:02:04.430> in<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:04.790> market<00:02:05.150> you

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
this is like unique in the market you

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.180 
this is like unique in the market you
don't<00:02:05.450> have<00:02:05.600> fun<00:02:05.750> anywhere<00:02:05.869> means<00:02:06.410> when<00:02:07.040> I'm

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
don't have fun anywhere means when I'm

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.979 
don't have fun anywhere means when I'm
playing<00:02:07.430> guitar<00:02:07.940> or<00:02:08.179> singing<00:02:08.570> whatever<00:02:08.720> I<00:02:08.929> do
