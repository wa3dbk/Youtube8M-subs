00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:10.699
This generation has been brought up on toys,
things that distract them from reality.

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:18.500
People are playing video games, continuously
looking for new toys, things to occupy themselves

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:27.390
with, forever unsatisfied and separated from
reality.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.260
They escape reality with their toys.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:39.040
They are always looking for a new "kick" in
life but they do not face reality.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.270
They never get to know Jesus Christ.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:52.270
Even Christians are playing around with studies,
ipads and new gizmos instead of getting to

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.650
know Jesus Christ.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:00.329
Relationships fall apart because people do
not really talk to each other.

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.469
They text, senseless messages.

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:09.979
They do not get to properly communicate and
they do not get to know God, listen to God,

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:16.049
be in His presence, be taught by Him, be led
by Him.

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.810
They are just looking for entertainment and
escape.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.429
Are you going after entertainment?

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:34.100
Are you for ever looking for a new"kick,"
stimulation or are you looking for Jesus Christ.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:43.249
He will say to many believers in that day:"Go
away I never knew you, you workers of wickedness."

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:45.729
Because they were always PLAYING.

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:55.270
They never got serious about Jesus Christ
Himself but they were looking for stimulation,

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.600
satisfaction and their own pleasure.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.689
Are you seeking reality?

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:14.700
Are you seeking Jesus Christ or do you occupy
yourself with TOYS and are you PLAYING?

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.420
Many people will miss eternity because they
PLAYED THEIR LIFE AWAY.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.170
May Jesus bless you.
