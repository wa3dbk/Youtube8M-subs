00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:03.439
 I'll tell you what 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.940
 I would like to speak today proved to be mainly the auxiliary verbs 

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:13.839
 You can see everyone on my page. 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:17.849
 and I want their attention because they are at the base of the language 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:20.849
 English 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.289
 I would not lose an idea of â€‹â€‹the importance of living 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.409
 It's impossible to make a square and I can not use one of them. 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.740
 it's impossible to ask a question to anyone who hurts 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.860
 without using one of those winters 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.270
 ii most of them 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.270
 also appears affirmative phrases 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.780
 would have been released semiarid 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.170
 also 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.170
 formed the English League verbal tenses 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.920
 even for use with a probable past 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.920
 another likely future 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.070
 to do 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.130
 the gift 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.130
 the future of the past I intend to do 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.100
 so the beginning 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.400
 in this long journey that is the learning of the language 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.830
 focused 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.260
 orbis vague 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.300
 concentrate 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.300
 in these periods 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.440
 more internally 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.590
 he has 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.100
 fourteen 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.300
 auxiliary verbs 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.580
 enough 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.030
 used in the language 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.300
 they are some more 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.440
 that are not so used I will not address here today 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.310
 and others that some authors consider the semi-arid 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.890
 So let's go squid 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.070
 to each tournament auxiliary burns 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.070
 educator released then 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.750
 the base 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.849
 collect learn a language without the knowledge of the desperate 

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:17.699
 is the new orleans columnist 

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:19.249
 without knowing 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:20.429
 to fat 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:23.219
 low grades 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:26.219
 so come on 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:32.499
 evident to move the semiarid 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.269
 of a category 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:36.469
 and 9 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:39.469
 from another 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.459
 nine global terms 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.929
 the government says 

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:47.799
 which are also used 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.799
 how would it be 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.949
 the first bourbon nephew hotel 

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:59.709
 in its forms 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.709
 of the present 

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:07.379
 the past 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.379
 balls 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.289
 serious and your past 

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:18.289
 face 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:28.449
 so we have here also the post with its five formats 

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:32.219
 text and in the past pop 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:39.899
 the manners 

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:42.899
 There are nine I'm going to quote 9 only 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.689
 are 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:50.979
 each 

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:53.979
 in your past 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:00.159
 best scorer 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:03.969
 in the law 

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:06.969
 and overturned 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:10.799
 general 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:11.979
 in your past 

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:14.979
 Juan 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:18.889
 and finally 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:23.509
 but we will see 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:24.849
 each one of them 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:27.849
 in isolation 

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:31.739
 blindness only at the end
