 screen recording video from the desktop of us 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.210

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.899
 a window appears in which we can 

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:59.809
 start this capture that is start recording 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.690
 screen we can choose the whole screen 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.680
 the region is now chosen exactly the region we 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:09.320
 we can also manually stretch it 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:13.880
 you can select a specific window for example 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:17.240
 you we select the window first press escape

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.400
 choose reduce its size 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.300
 so that you can show in more detail 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.700
 how to work with a window we select a window and we 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.910
 we can select a specific area for 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.970
 records for example we need the whole window 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:38.240
 google chrome browser here we have chosen 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:45.230
 Now we are recording this particular area. 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:47.090
 we can choose drawing and here there is 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.880
 tools we can 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.040
 enjoy while recording our 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.620
 video lesson for example let's put a window 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.180
 slightly higher 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.820
 to this window which 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:02.230
 where the tools were located 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:06.340
 conveniently located for use 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:09.229
 we can take a picture of our video 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.220
 instead of video we can take a picture 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.230
 start capture ie start recording 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.640
 look at the settings I think look 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.690
 independently everything works by default 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.400
 you can start working 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.760
 exactly 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:30.069
 default and so start capture 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:32.709
 click to stop later 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.560

 it is automatically added to us 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:50.169
 video that we recorded 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:53.440
 go to the current project section and here 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:57.190
 we can drag files to work with 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.709
 our video remind these files can 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:03.220
 be pictures sounds other some 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:06.250
 video and so on with the time scale we 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:09.190
 working this way we push the left 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:12.239
 right click this we stretch 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:15.040
 scale down to the left 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:18.370
 also we can do it right here 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.680
 socket we can share our project with 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:24.550
 using this function here now 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:29.770
 we get two video files and we can 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:31.300
 between them to do the transition set here 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.669
 such a transition and that 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.580
 edit this transition we need 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:38.360
 go to 1 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:40.220
 box do here click right 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.509
 click on this transition to select 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:50.419
 transition and put the duration of this 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:51.409
 transition for example 3 30 seconds is a lot 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:57.759
 03 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:57.759
 i.e. three seconds here ok 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:06.069
 further back to the timeline here 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:09.860
 we still have sound tracks 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:13.129
 adding text effects and working with 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.870
 sound already familiar in the following 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:18.080
 our video tutorials on the site 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:22.449
