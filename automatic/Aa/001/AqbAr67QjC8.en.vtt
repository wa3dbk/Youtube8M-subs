00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
stronger I am the longer I stay alive

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.520 
stronger I am the longer I stay alive
and<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.119> longer<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.479> stay<00:01:36.630> alive<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.290> more<00:01:37.470> I

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
and the longer to stay alive the more I

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.499 
and the longer to stay alive the more I
can<00:01:37.740> use<00:01:37.860> my<00:01:38.009> moves<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.850> by<00:01:39.030> using<00:01:39.210> one<00:01:39.390> move

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
can use my moves and by using one move

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.170 
can use my moves and by using one move
more<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.320> quicker<00:01:40.530> they<00:01:40.680> level<00:01:40.920> up<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.729> my

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
more the quicker they level up so my

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.969 
more the quicker they level up so my
usual<00:01:42.360> tactic<00:01:42.840> was<00:01:43.110> at<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.500> start<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.799> game

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
usual tactic was at the start the game

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.639 
usual tactic was at the start the game
to<00:01:44.280> use<00:01:44.430> be<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.700> crouch<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.270> still<00:01:45.840> pretty<00:01:46.320> far

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
to use be to crouch and still pretty far

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.350 
to use be to crouch and still pretty far
away<00:01:46.740> from<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.009> Stein<00:01:47.189> zone<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.970> way<00:01:48.119> it

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
away from the Stein zone that way it

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.730 
away from the Stein zone that way it
makes<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.600> harder<00:01:48.869> for<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.049> NPC<00:01:49.380> hunters<00:01:49.680> to

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
makes it harder for the NPC hunters to

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.260 
makes it harder for the NPC hunters to
try<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:49.979> find<00:01:50.159> me<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:50.880> way<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.000> can<00:01:51.180> take

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
try and find me so that way you can take

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.550 
try and find me so that way you can take
your<00:01:51.390> time<00:01:51.600> eating<00:01:51.810> on<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.229> monsters

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
your time eating on the monsters

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.050 
your time eating on the monsters
leveling<00:01:53.040> up<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.310> then<00:01:53.610> once<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:53.880> hit<00:01:54.000> level

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
leveling up and then once you hit level

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.149 
leveling up and then once you hit level
three<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.689> get<00:01:55.140> your<00:01:55.290> shield<00:01:55.470> maxed<00:01:55.829> out<00:01:55.920> and

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
three you get your shield maxed out and

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.700 
three you get your shield maxed out and
you<00:01:56.399> go<00:01:56.549> looking<00:01:56.850> for<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.030> hunters<00:01:57.409> then<00:01:58.409> it's

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
you go looking for the hunters then it's

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.260 
you go looking for the hunters then it's
a<00:01:58.770> simple<00:01:58.920> case<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.219> cycling<00:01:59.820> between<00:01:59.909> your

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
a simple case of cycling between your

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.060 
a simple case of cycling between your
moves<00:02:00.479> don't<00:02:01.170> worry<00:02:01.409> about<00:02:01.500> actually<00:02:01.710> winning

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
moves don't worry about actually winning

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.440 
moves don't worry about actually winning
the<00:02:02.219> round<00:02:02.340> that's<00:02:02.759> not<00:02:02.909> really<00:02:03.060> important

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
the round that's not really important

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.090 
the round that's not really important
you<00:02:03.960> just<00:02:03.990> want<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.290> focus<00:02:04.469> on<00:02:04.710> using<00:02:05.040> your

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
you just want to focus on using your

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.340 
you just want to focus on using your
moves<00:02:05.340> so<00:02:05.880> with<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.360> in<00:02:06.450> mind<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.810> tended<00:02:07.229> to

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
moves so with that in mind I tended to

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.749 
moves so with that in mind I tended to
avoid<00:02:07.439> using<00:02:07.890> my<00:02:07.950> right<00:02:08.129> trigger<00:02:08.310> moves<00:02:08.550> too

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
avoid using my right trigger moves too

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.609 
avoid using my right trigger moves too
much<00:02:08.940> just<00:02:09.270> simply<00:02:09.539> because<00:02:09.810> I'm<00:02:10.200> not<00:02:10.349> worried

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
much just simply because I'm not worried

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.080 
much just simply because I'm not worried
about<00:02:10.709> my<00:02:10.860> based<00:02:11.069> attacks<00:02:11.340> I'm<00:02:11.580> just<00:02:11.879> worried

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
about my based attacks I'm just worried

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.920 
about my based attacks I'm just worried
about<00:02:12.239> using<00:02:12.390> my<00:02:12.629> spear

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
about using my spear

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.990 
about using my spear
so<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:13.950> cycle<00:02:14.310> through<00:02:14.489> them<00:02:14.610> let<00:02:14.970> them

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
so you cycle through them let them

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.940 
so you cycle through them let them
recharge<00:02:15.390> go<00:02:15.780> again<00:02:16.079> and<00:02:16.470> once<00:02:16.769> you've<00:02:16.920> done

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
recharge go again and once you've done
