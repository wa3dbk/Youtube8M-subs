00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
each look like this is the coral ista

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.510 
each look like this is the coral ista
package<00:00:36.570> here<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:39.800> querulous<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.190> a

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
package here and querulous that is a

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.720 
package here and querulous that is a
sheer<00:00:42.030> coral<00:00:42.750> color<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:44.340> coordinates

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
sheer coral color and it coordinates

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.880 
sheer coral color and it coordinates
with<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.000> coral<00:00:45.360> list<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.719> blush<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.410> actually

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
with the coral list of blush I actually

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.680 
with the coral list of blush I actually
don't<00:00:47.129> have<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.550> coral<00:00:47.820> s<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.090> blush

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
don't have the coral s to blush

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.709 
don't have the coral s to blush
I<00:00:49.520> think<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.579> probably<00:00:50.789> will<00:00:51.149> purchase<00:00:51.420> the

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
I think I probably will purchase the

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.209 
I think I probably will purchase the
blush<00:00:51.899> actually<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.530> coordinate<00:00:52.920> with<00:00:53.070> the

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
blush actually to coordinate with the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.639 
blush actually to coordinate with the
lip<00:00:53.370> gloss<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.719> tube<00:00:54.899> looks<00:00:55.140> like<00:00:55.289> this<00:00:55.500> is

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
lip gloss so the tube looks like this is

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.810 
lip gloss so the tube looks like this is
the<00:00:55.680> squeeze<00:00:56.100> tube

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
a sheer nude lip gloss and you don't

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.250 
a sheer nude lip gloss and you don't
have<00:02:27.890> to<00:02:28.070> buy<00:02:28.190> hoola<00:02:28.790> to<00:02:29.090> get<00:02:29.239> that<00:02:29.510> same<00:02:29.959> look

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
have to buy hoola to get that same look

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.890 
have to buy hoola to get that same look
so<00:02:30.709> I<00:02:31.040> decided<00:02:31.940> to<00:02:32.060> pass<00:02:32.269> on<00:02:32.510> that<00:02:32.630> just

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
so I decided to pass on that just

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.240 
so I decided to pass on that just
because<00:02:33.110> I<00:02:33.140> didn't<00:02:33.440> think<00:02:33.590> it<00:02:33.709> was<00:02:33.830> unique

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
because I didn't think it was unique

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.180 
because I didn't think it was unique
enough<00:02:34.549> but<00:02:35.000> I<00:02:35.239> do<00:02:35.540> quite<00:02:35.989> like<00:02:36.019> these<00:02:36.799> for

I decided not to get the complementing
lip<00:02:52.310> gloss<00:02:52.519> just<00:02:52.880> because<00:02:53.120> I<00:02:53.180> didn't<00:02:53.450> think<00:02:53.630> it

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
lip gloss just because I didn't think it

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.810

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.690 
overall I do really like these lip
glosses<00:03:34.340> i<00:03:34.849> think<00:03:35.359> the<00:03:36.159> coralista<00:03:37.159> is

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
glosses i think the coralista is

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.440 
glosses i think the coralista is
probably<00:03:38.329> the<00:03:39.139> most<00:03:39.290> sheer<00:03:40.010> out<00:03:40.280> of<00:03:40.609> the<00:03:41.209> four

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
probably the most sheer out of the four

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.929 
probably the most sheer out of the four
that<00:03:41.659> I<00:03:41.689> have<00:03:42.019> if<00:03:42.590> you're<00:03:43.280> looking<00:03:43.609> something

00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:43.939 
that I have if you're looking something

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:47.740 
that I have if you're looking something
with<00:03:44.810> enough<00:03:45.819> pigmentation<00:03:46.819> and<00:03:47.000> color<00:03:47.450> with

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
with enough pigmentation and color with

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.629 
with enough pigmentation and color with
a<00:03:47.780> lot<00:03:48.049> of<00:03:48.139> pigmentation<00:03:48.530> in<00:03:48.769> color<00:03:48.950> then<00:03:49.609> I

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:49.639 
a lot of pigmentation in color then I

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:57.009 
a lot of pigmentation in color then I
think<00:03:50.349> either<00:03:51.349> the<00:03:51.620> sugar<00:03:51.889> bomb<00:03:52.900> or<00:03:54.730> the<00:03:56.019> Bella

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
think either the sugar bomb or the Bella

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:59.319 
think either the sugar bomb or the Bella
bamba'<00:03:57.409> would<00:03:57.739> be<00:03:57.889> a<00:03:58.159> good<00:03:58.549> purchase<00:03:58.760> for<00:03:59.150> you

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
bamba' would be a good purchase for you

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.830 
bamba' would be a good purchase for you
if<00:03:59.689> you<00:04:00.139> do<00:04:00.379> like<00:04:00.709> sheer<00:04:01.370> and<00:04:01.849> not<00:04:02.450> a<00:04:02.480> whole<00:04:02.689> lot

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
if you do like sheer and not a whole lot

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.589 
if you do like sheer and not a whole lot
of<00:04:02.930> color<00:04:03.109> then<00:04:03.739> either<00:04:04.370> the<00:04:04.730> coralista

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
of color then either the coralista

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:11.800 
of color then either the coralista
or<00:04:05.840> the<00:04:07.359> dandelion<00:04:08.359> would<00:04:08.629> be<00:04:08.780> a<00:04:08.810> good<00:04:08.989> pick<00:04:10.810> if

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
or the dandelion would be a good pick if

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.679 
or the dandelion would be a good pick if
you<00:04:12.500> have<00:04:12.919> cool<00:04:13.579> skin<00:04:14.090> tones

00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:14.689 
you have cool skin tones

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:17.499 
you have cool skin tones
I<00:04:14.780> think<00:04:15.290> the<00:04:15.530> sugar<00:04:15.829> bomb<00:04:16.039> or<00:04:16.549> the<00:04:16.880> dandelion

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:17.509 
I think the sugar bomb or the dandelion

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:19.360 
I think the sugar bomb or the dandelion
would<00:04:17.720> be<00:04:17.840> a<00:04:17.870> good<00:04:18.109> pick<00:04:18.289> for<00:04:18.530> you<00:04:18.620> if<00:04:18.829> you<00:04:19.070> are

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
would be a good pick for you if you are

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.339 
would be a good pick for you if you are
a<00:04:19.669> warmer<00:04:20.209> skin<00:04:20.510> tone<00:04:20.750> person<00:04:21.229> then

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:21.349 
a warmer skin tone person then

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:24.010 
a warmer skin tone person then
definitely<00:04:21.560> the<00:04:22.039> coralista<00:04:22.520> and<00:04:23.000> the<00:04:23.690> bella

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
definitely the coralista and the bella

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.939 
definitely the coralista and the bella
bomba<00:04:24.380> would<00:04:24.680> be<00:04:24.889> the<00:04:25.310> best<00:04:25.550> picks<00:04:25.849> for<00:04:26.240> you<00:04:26.360> so

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:26.949 
bomba would be the best picks for you so

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:29.980 
bomba would be the best picks for you so
that<00:04:27.949> is<00:04:28.130> it<00:04:28.310> that's<00:04:28.610> I<00:04:29.030> think<00:04:29.599> they're<00:04:29.960> a

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
that is it that's I think they're a

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:37.360 
that is it that's I think they're a
great<00:04:30.470> purchase<00:04:30.909> as<00:04:31.909> as<00:04:33.220> for<00:04:34.220> where<00:04:35.060> I<00:04:35.510> I<00:04:36.409> don't

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
great purchase as as for where I I don't

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.469 
great purchase as as for where I I don't
think<00:04:37.520> they<00:04:37.639> have<00:04:37.820> like<00:04:39.250> great<00:04:40.250> longevity<00:04:41.210> I

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
think they have like great longevity I

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.129 
think they have like great longevity I
don't<00:04:41.690> think<00:04:41.900> they<00:04:42.020> last<00:04:42.260> on<00:04:43.039> the<00:04:43.220> lips<00:04:43.460> a

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
don't think they last on the lips a

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:45.850 
don't think they last on the lips a
really<00:04:45.139> really<00:04:45.380> long<00:04:45.500> time

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
really really long time

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.100 
really really long time
I<00:04:46.159> haven't<00:04:46.400> actually<00:04:46.580> specifically<00:04:47.509> time<00:04:47.810> dip

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
I haven't actually specifically time dip

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.740 
I haven't actually specifically time dip
but<00:04:48.550> they're<00:04:49.550> certainly<00:04:49.729> not<00:04:49.940> long<00:04:50.210> lasting

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
but they're certainly not long lasting

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.680 
but they're certainly not long lasting

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.420 
you do need to reapply they feel really
comfortable<00:04:53.960> on<00:04:54.440> the<00:04:54.590> lips<00:04:54.620> they<00:04:55.190> are<00:04:55.250> not

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
comfortable on the lips they are not

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.909 
comfortable on the lips they are not
sticky<00:04:55.940> they're<00:04:56.210> not<00:04:56.240> tacky<00:04:56.530> they<00:04:57.530> actually

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
so for me that's really important in the

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.520 
so for me that's really important in the
lip<00:05:02.120> gloss<00:05:02.360> because<00:05:02.570> I<00:05:02.750> can't<00:05:02.990> stand<00:05:03.289> the
