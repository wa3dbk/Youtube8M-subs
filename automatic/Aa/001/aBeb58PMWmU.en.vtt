00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hectic life interesting work 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.839
 stress altolÃ  need a break 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.210
 regenerating but light at the same time 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.769
 so today I decided to offer you one 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.599
 recipe with one of the ingredients 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.089
 protagonists of spring and 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.940
 summer or strawberries we see 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.590
 how to prepare a strawberry mousse 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.449
 light, however, gluten-free 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.519
 also indicated for the feeding of 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.220
 vegans 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:29.970
 ingredients for 4 5 portions 300 grams 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.329
 of fresh strawberries 250 g of yogurt of 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.780
 strawberry soy 50 g saga syrup 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:40.050
 maple syrup 4 grams of agar 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.110
 agar 20 grams of cornstarch 150 g of milk 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.420
 of rice or soybean after assembling the 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.030
 properly washed dried strawberries 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.489
 the buffered or chopped 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.879
 gathered inside a baker we find 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.879
 in all 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.260
 Now let's transfer the strawberry smoothie 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.970
 inside a casserole we have it 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.340
 the container so to speak with del 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.110
 vegetable milk I chose the milk of 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.540
 rice no almond milk is fine too 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.540
 of soy or any other type of milk 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.270
 that we wish to use with del 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.979
 agar syrup of maple syrup 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:21.610
 it also depends on sweetness 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:24.940
 of strawberries so we add one 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.619
 Soy yogurt with strawberry flavor 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.090
 you can also use a neo taste 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.920
 on vaio selected from strawberries for 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.920
 relate flavor and aroma 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:43.990
 we mix with a fort and we play 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:52.509
 corn starch or any other 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:56.520
 type of starch in the agar agar that is says 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.520
 hot for us we want it cold 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.569
 we bring on the fire we deliver mix 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.780
 until reaching 80 85 degrees 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:12.030
 so that the tender will act and 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.030
 also the high thickening starch 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.440
 I advise you to dissolve starch and have 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.860
 always cold so that there are not 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.840
 lumps 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.840
 once it's full of everything 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.340
 having reached 85 degrees I turned off the 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.410
 fire you see that it is slightly raised 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.080
 but not entirely because the race from 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.660
 it acts hot but the result can be seen 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.489
 cold what we do here I have prepared 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.350
 I show you two ways of bowls 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:45.050
 the first presentation is this 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:48.860
 simpler more practical we pour one 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:52.880
 portion per bowl of the north of the 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.610
 our mus and we let them cool down there 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.560
 and to the rest we do not go inside into the 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.390
 casserole so that it cools o 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.430
 I 'd better get it finished 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.890
 however ambient temperature after 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.380
 which we will see how to present it inside 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.870
 of a bag carries after about an hour 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.290
 of les les murs is practically 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.620
 ready I show you different types of 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.430
 presentation 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.880
 this is the fine that I have overturned and I have 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.350
 put on a very nice saucer you see 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.900
 maybe we commit a strawberry on it 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.060
 also for decoration this is the mousse 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.160
 much more comfortable and practical 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.430
 Now here I have prepared two bowls 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.350
 with strawberries towards the mousse I have 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.900
 stored inside the saucepan 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:39.610
 you remember from verse inside one 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.610
 porsche bag with spout star 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.019
 and then I go to squeeze it over the 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.019
 strawberries 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.460
 learn to cuddle ourselves to carve out 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.230
 some time of day from 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.090
 dedicate ourselves just maybe 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.990
 tasting something we like that there 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.820
 arrived 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.530
 definitely this strawberry mousse e 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.930
 what we need to give us strength 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.820
 energy with a touch of lightness 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.170
 I hope you enjoyed my research 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.060
 maybe you like it 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.990
