probably maybe cause I should say Ashe
is<00:00:51.989> definitely<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.440> cause<00:00:52.620> for<00:00:53.100> Toby<00:00:54.030> Rama's

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530

we'll see from Madras by preview confirm
later<00:03:20.600> they<00:03:21.600> still<00:03:21.989> act<00:03:22.230> like<00:03:22.350> so<00:03:22.769> so

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
later they still act like so so

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.890 
later they still act like so so
childlike<00:03:23.760> around<00:03:24.120> each<00:03:24.209> other<00:03:24.359> and<00:03:24.690> I<00:03:24.870> think

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
childlike around each other and I think

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.420 
childlike around each other and I think
that's<00:03:25.230> because<00:03:25.500> they<00:03:25.590> hide<00:03:25.769> their<00:03:25.980> surnames

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
that's because they hide their surnames

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.770 
that's because they hide their surnames
because<00:03:26.670> when<00:03:26.850> that<00:03:26.940> wouldn't<00:03:27.390> always<00:03:27.480> kids

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
because when that wouldn't always kids

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.300 
because when that wouldn't always kids
talk<00:03:27.989> they<00:03:28.440> don't<00:03:28.470> say<00:03:28.769> their<00:03:28.950> surnames

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
talk they don't say their surnames

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.860 
talk they don't say their surnames

should say I had four brothers and that
is<00:03:49.410> very<00:03:49.920> weird<00:03:50.250> why<00:03:51.000> did<00:03:51.329> he<00:03:51.450> speak<00:03:51.720> about<00:03:52.019> his

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
is very weird why did he speak about his

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.830 
is very weird why did he speak about his
brothers<00:03:52.620> as<00:03:53.340> also<00:03:53.639> for<00:03:53.850> them<00:03:54.030> which<00:03:54.269> is<00:03:54.299> a<00:03:54.600> new

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
brothers as also for them which is a new

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.770 
brothers as also for them which is a new
reviewing<00:03:55.380> thought<00:03:55.560> of<00:03:55.650> one<00:03:56.569> why<00:03:57.569> is<00:03:57.630> he

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
reviewing thought of one why is he

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:58.640 
reviewing thought of one why is he
talking<00:03:57.900> about<00:03:58.019> them<00:03:58.230> if<00:03:58.319> they're<00:03:58.440> already

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
talking about them if they're already

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.770 
talking about them if they're already
dead<00:03:58.799> I<00:03:59.220> think<00:03:59.790> this<00:03:59.880> is<00:03:59.970> because<00:04:00.299> he's

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
dead I think this is because he's

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.319 
dead I think this is because he's
resigned<00:04:01.319> himself<00:04:01.560> to<00:04:02.040> think<00:04:02.670> right<00:04:03.000> they

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
resigned himself to think right they

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:04.220 
resigned himself to think right they
could<00:04:03.510> die<00:04:03.660> at<00:04:03.720> any<00:04:03.810> minute

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
could die at any minute

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.390 
could die at any minute
I've<00:04:04.380> just<00:04:04.560> got<00:04:04.709> to<00:04:04.769> assume<00:04:05.010> they're<00:04:05.220> dead<00:04:05.370> now

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
I've just got to assume they're dead now

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.849 
I've just got to assume they're dead now
and<00:04:05.819> not<00:04:06.180> only<00:04:06.209> bother<00:04:06.569> me<00:04:06.750> if<00:04:06.870> they<00:04:06.989> do<00:04:07.049> die<00:04:07.319> so

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
and not only bother me if they do die so

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:09.259 
and not only bother me if they do die so
I<00:04:07.889> think<00:04:07.950> that's<00:04:08.430> the<00:04:08.609> way<00:04:08.700> he's<00:04:08.819> thinking<00:04:09.180> of

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
I think that's the way he's thinking of

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:10.940 
I think that's the way he's thinking of
course<00:04:09.810> when<00:04:10.079> they<00:04:10.200> actually<00:04:10.319> eventually<00:04:10.560> do

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
course when they actually eventually do

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.470 
course when they actually eventually do
die<00:04:11.130> it<00:04:11.430> will<00:04:11.549> probably<00:04:11.760> out<00:04:11.940> of<00:04:12.030> his<00:04:12.150> mind<00:04:12.299> if

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
die it will probably out of his mind if

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.670 
die it will probably out of his mind if
you're<00:04:12.569> sharing<00:04:12.690> again<00:04:12.930> and<00:04:13.170> you'll<00:04:13.319> get<00:04:13.470> like

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
you're sharing again and you'll get like

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.479 
you're sharing again and you'll get like
really<00:04:13.859> crazy<00:04:14.600> and<00:04:15.600> also<00:04:15.840> this<00:04:16.019> like<00:04:16.500> by<00:04:17.159> death

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
really crazy and also this like by death

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.909 
really crazy and also this like by death
of<00:04:17.729> children<00:04:17.970> I<00:04:18.419> think<00:04:19.200> this<00:04:19.409> has<00:04:19.530> led<00:04:19.680> to<00:04:19.709> why

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
of children I think this has led to why

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.259 
of children I think this has led to why
there's<00:04:20.099> so<00:04:20.190> much<00:04:20.280> knowledge<00:04:20.549> about<00:04:20.729> man<00:04:21.150> you

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
there's so much knowledge about man you

there's so much knowledge about man you

could show

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.900 
could show
