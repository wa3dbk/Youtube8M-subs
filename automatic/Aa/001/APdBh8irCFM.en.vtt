you simply up stuck a three three three
and<00:00:19.590> then<00:00:19.680> come<00:00:19.859> back<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.130> beginning<00:00:20.189> and

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
and then come back to the beginning and

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.970 
and then come back to the beginning and
take<00:00:20.640> them<00:00:20.789> down<00:00:23.750> the<00:00:24.750> way<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:24.960> do<00:00:25.170> this<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.560> if

once you can do it and a full sequence
you<00:00:55.140> can<00:00:55.230> use<00:00:55.410> your<00:00:55.500> timer<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:55.920> see<00:00:56.129> what<00:00:56.219> you

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
you can use your timer and see what you

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:06.770 
you can use your timer and see what you
can<00:00:56.399> get<00:01:04.760> and<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.880> world<00:01:06.060> record<00:01:06.390> for<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.630> is

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.859 
can get and the world record for that is
one<00:01:07.020> point<00:01:07.290> four<00:01:07.560> eight<00:01:07.890> seconds<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.880> next

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
one point four eight seconds the next

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.350 
one point four eight seconds the next
stack<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.470> called<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.860> 363<00:01:11.520> which<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:12.090> a

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
stack is called the 363 which is a

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.570 
stack is called the 363 which is a
little<00:01:13.170> more<00:01:13.290> complex<00:01:13.740> than<00:01:13.860> fifty<00:01:14.340> three

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
little more complex than fifty three

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.730 
little more complex than fifty three
it's<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.299> three<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.869> then<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.020> up<00:01:16.110> stack<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.380> six

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
it's a three and then you up stack a six

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.130 
it's a three and then you up stack a six
in<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.950> middle<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.490> three

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
in the middle and a three

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.570 
in the middle and a three
so<00:01:19.140> when<00:01:19.560> you're<00:01:19.770> right-handed<00:01:20.040> you're<00:01:20.460> gonna

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
so when you're right-handed you're gonna

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.630 
so when you're right-handed you're gonna
take<00:01:20.790> one<00:01:21.000> from<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.330> right<00:01:22.009> on<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.280> right<00:01:23.310> and

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
take one from the right on the right and

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.130 
take one from the right on the right and
then<00:01:23.729> put<00:01:23.880> on<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.000> top<00:01:24.270> just<00:01:24.720> like<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.840> three

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
then put on the top just like a three

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.539 
then put on the top just like a three
and<00:01:25.590> you're<00:01:25.770> gonna<00:01:25.860> grab<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.189> three<00:01:26.340> with<00:01:26.460> the

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
and you're gonna grab the three with the

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.760 
and you're gonna grab the three with the
right<00:01:26.700> hand<00:01:27.000> two<00:01:27.869> with<00:01:27.990> your<00:01:28.110> left<00:01:28.290> hand<00:01:28.439> go

right hand two with your left hand go

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.749 
right hand two with your left hand go
right<00:01:28.939> left<00:01:29.939> right<00:01:30.210> left<00:01:30.810> right<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:32.040> then

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
right left right left right and then

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.310 
right left right left right and then
you're<00:01:33.119> gonna<00:01:33.210> do<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.630> same<00:01:33.810> for<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.110> three

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
you're gonna do the same for the three

you're gonna do the same for the three
and<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:34.979> come<00:01:35.159> back<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.460> beginning<00:01:35.579> same

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
and you come back to the beginning same

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.730 
and you come back to the beginning same
thing<00:01:36.420> for<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.659> three<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.020> then<00:01:37.619> you're

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.830 
was a best and then the most complex
sequence<00:02:00.570> of<00:02:00.960> all<00:02:01.110> them<00:02:01.649> is<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.130> cycle<00:02:02.759> what<00:02:03.719> it

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
sequence of all them is a cycle what it

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.200 
sequence of all them is a cycle what it
is<00:02:03.990> it's<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.350> three<00:02:04.710> six<00:02:05.009> three<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.520> then<00:02:06.090> you

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
is it's a three six three and then you

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.850 
is it's a three six three and then you
slide<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.479> three<00:02:06.780> over<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.290> do<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.409> six<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:08.599> six

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
slide the three over to do a six a six

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.510 
slide the three over to do a six a six
and<00:02:10.860> then<00:02:11.009> you<00:02:11.099> take<00:02:11.280> them<00:02:11.370> all<00:02:11.520> down

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
and then you take them all down

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.540 
and then you take them all down
and<00:02:12.670> to<00:02:13.540> a<00:02:13.570> 110:1<00:02:15.240> back<00:02:16.240> into<00:02:16.510> a<00:02:16.540> 360<00:02:17.430> when<00:02:18.430> you

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
and to a 110:1 back into a 360 when you

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.940 
and to a 110:1 back into a 360 when you
do<00:02:18.670> this<00:02:18.850> you<00:02:19.150> do<00:02:19.300> your<00:02:19.450> regular<00:02:19.570> 363<00:02:22.860> but<00:02:23.860> you

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
do this you do your regular 363 but you

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.620 
do this you do your regular 363 but you
take<00:02:24.130> your<00:02:24.190> right<00:02:24.400> hand<00:02:24.430> inside<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:25.060> hole<00:02:25.240> 3

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
take your right hand inside the hole 3

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.090 
take your right hand inside the hole 3
behind<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.650> 6<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:27.250> then<00:02:27.370> you<00:02:27.460> do<00:02:27.610> 6<00:02:28.140> 6<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.980> go

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
behind the 6 and then you do 6 6 and go

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.210 
behind the 6 and then you do 6 6 and go
back<00:02:30.280> inning<00:02:30.780> slide<00:02:31.780> like<00:02:32.080> a<00:02:32.200> 6<00:02:32.560> but<00:02:32.890> you<00:02:33.010> keep

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
back inning slide like a 6 but you keep

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.490 
back inning slide like a 6 but you keep
them<00:02:33.370> in<00:02:33.490> two<00:02:33.730> separate<00:02:34.360> threes<00:02:34.630> and<00:02:35.230> then<00:02:35.380> you

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
them in two separate threes and then you

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.160 
them in two separate threes and then you
do<00:02:35.790> slide<00:02:36.790> to<00:02:37.360> both<00:02:37.540> sides<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:38.020> then<00:02:38.140> take
