that<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.570> seems<00:00:24.810> that<00:00:24.900> with<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.109> leftovers

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
that it seems that with the leftovers

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
might have been able to do a lot of

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.460 
might have been able to do a lot of
damage<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.970> rest<00:03:12.150> of<00:03:12.240> his<00:03:12.330> team<00:03:12.570> but<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.290> fact

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
damage the rest of his team but the fact

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.960 
damage the rest of his team but the fact
that<00:03:13.530> he<00:03:13.620> did<00:03:13.800> stay<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:14.220> probably<00:03:14.520> tells<00:03:14.790> me

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
that he did stay and probably tells me

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.400 
that he did stay and probably tells me
that<00:03:15.120> he<00:03:15.180> does<00:03:15.360> I've<00:03:15.540> raw<00:03:15.750> unless<00:03:15.960> he<00:03:16.110> was<00:03:16.200> just

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
for during it which I doubt he'd do

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.390 
for during it which I doubt he'd do
since<00:03:19.260> he<00:03:19.410> had<00:03:19.910> Skarmory<00:03:20.910> and<00:03:22.190> seohyun<00:03:23.190> left
