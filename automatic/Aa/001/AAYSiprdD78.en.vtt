00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.920 
alcohol stove that I made and i'll make
a<00:02:01.229> video<00:02:01.439> on<00:02:01.829> making<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.969> i<00:02:03.509> like<00:02:03.750> that

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
a video on making that and i like that

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.139 
a video on making that and i like that
in<00:02:04.110> my<00:02:04.259> sink<00:02:04.649> when<00:02:05.100> i<00:02:05.130> open<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.610> hatch<00:02:05.790> and

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
in my sink when i open the hatch and

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.749 
in my sink when i open the hatch and
stick<00:02:06.509> my<00:02:06.659> head<00:02:06.840> out<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:07.200> smoke<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.759> that

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
stick my head out to smoke and that

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.780 
stick my head out to smoke and that
allows<00:02:09.030> enough<00:02:09.360> oxygen<00:02:09.959> in<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.440> where

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
allows enough oxygen in to where

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.260 
allows enough oxygen in to where
it<00:02:11.790> kind<00:02:12.090> of<00:02:12.180> offsets<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:13.550> cold<00:02:14.550> coming<00:02:14.970> in

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
it kind of offsets the cold coming in

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.180 
it kind of offsets the cold coming in
from<00:02:15.570> the<00:02:15.690> heat<00:02:15.900> things<00:02:16.410> of<00:02:16.620> that<00:02:16.740> nature<00:02:16.770> i

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
from the heat things of that nature i

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.910 
from the heat things of that nature i
would<00:02:17.550> i<00:02:17.700> would<00:02:17.850> like<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.330> think<00:02:18.510> i<00:02:18.920> haven't

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
would i would like to think i haven't

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.240 
would i would like to think i haven't
passed<00:02:20.100> out<00:02:20.340> yet<00:02:20.400> so<00:02:21.090> that's<00:02:21.360> kind<00:02:21.690> of<00:02:21.750> good<00:02:21.930> I

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
passed out yet so that's kind of good I

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
passed out yet so that's kind of good I
wouldn't<00:02:23.250> light<00:02:23.490> that<00:02:23.730> stove<00:02:24.030> with

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
wouldn't light that stove with

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.410 
wouldn't light that stove with
