to<00:01:27.570> tycoon<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.579> muscle<00:01:29.579> heals<00:01:30.060> faster<00:01:30.540> well<00:01:30.930> if

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
to tycoon so muscle heals faster well if

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.740 
to tycoon so muscle heals faster well if
we<00:01:31.770> have<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.280> ability<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:33.119> pay<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.540> money
