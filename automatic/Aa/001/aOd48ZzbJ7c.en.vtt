00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 have 

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:08.049
 in 30 years he has had a 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.259
 internationalization that starts in the 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:14.380
 curitiba team and then goes to the 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:16.119
 Botafogo hike a town to the south and comes 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.880
 Tigers team of autonomous 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:21.460
 stealing what already full of experience no longer 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.430
 thank God that he has lived in the 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.220
 football many experiences we had with 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.859
 luck in a child not the typical player 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.840
 what it says is that I need to adapt is 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.690
 that I need to adapt for a defenses 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.150
 a little easier to adapt to a style 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.339
 of play to a style that for a 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.040
 midfield player or forward 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:44.320
 because I think it is really easier 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.570
 play in defense there is not so much you have 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.530
 everything of exact front more when already 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.170
 have a little more experience 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.570
 try to learn and that adapt as 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.940
 fast possible as he felt for the first 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.220
 once Mexican football in terms of 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.619
 competition the level that I have 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.269
 surprised compared to what 

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:05.140
 do the Koreans do I think the 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:09.159
 Koreans run many think little but 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.170
 the Brazilian thinks a lot and runs for 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.810
 is the truth the first impression the 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.219
 first toner mainly here the 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.219
 technical capacity of the equipment 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:21.700
 it really made me very good with 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:23.920
 players of a lot of capacity this is a 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.539
 tournament very very even very level 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.469
 also Mexican football with teams 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:32.229
 of a lot of quality is something good that makes 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:33.969
 a very good competition in the in the 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.399
 tournament I do not think the Mexican tournament 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:39.039
 is very level with a lot of equipment 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:40.990
 Joint capacity is highly technical 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:42.909
 also what was the team that most 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.039
 surprised for good or bad here in 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.670
 Mexican football the first team that 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:50.860
 gave him this 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:55.390
 comes a message that here or you 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.939
 Strips or you are going to suffer we touched good 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.439
 teams out there this saints 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:03.189
 lagoon have given in great moment when 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:04.840
 come this chivas also wants the 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.460
 team that we knew a little more 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.640
 females Chivas and America are both 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.560
 teams that play more the liberators 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.110
 I think not then do not have the opportunity 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.240
 to know a little bit more from outside 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.150
 of 40 and less other countries so 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.940
 but if there were difficult teams all for 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.610
 me they started very complicated and they continue 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.830
 being very complicated to win not to the 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.720
 true Mexican football every year 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.690
 happens is is getting stronger 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.250
 it's even improving much more 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.680
 come golden players to play here 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.050
 here mix of 10 more then that 's 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.120
 very good for light mexican football 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.090
 for the exact level of competence 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.160
 correct in the in the armed of the team 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.310
 of tigers I remember in that first 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.460
 suddenly players appear as 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.130
 the jiménez pilot on the right side 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.620
 hugo ayala in the center nile towers in 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.530
 the left side and a child in the center 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.320
 of the pitch a totally defensive 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.610
 another thing the defensives that just 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.940
 they had gone from here to the city ​​of 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.810
 Monterrey with a number of doubts 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.730
 impressive in such a way when 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.190
 you arrived then if we were 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.710
 seeing with a magnifying glass this big no 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:19.520
 then suddenly appear with a 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:21.140
 defensive solid elegant always 4 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.480
 never 5 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.160
 few times 6 almost never saved in a 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.910
 corner 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.070
 true but 4 always holding on 4 a 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.200
 the ones that the opposing team gives me 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.660
 it seems that with 4 sometimes they have been 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.250
 surprised as for example I dare 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.740
 to say that the day that saint lagoon came 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.940
 and not 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:45.220
 alone the husband three open two two 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.550
 open to the band I do not do not the tip 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.590
 this day the defensive was surprised 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.960
 of the tiger team because it counts a lot 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.790
 also the rival what we face but 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.730
 we try to do it 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.850
 our always do not have us 464 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:03.710
 very very well always stop with the 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.660
 help from salcido and 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.070
 and always the gringo towers also that 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.770
 He is not throwing hand right now with 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.470
 d'angelo also that helps us a lot in 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.050
 the defensive too and of course 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.420
 there are times that they will grab us because 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:20.060
 the rivals have their ability too 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.920
 most of those in the 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.140
 games we try to do well the 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.910
 things are very well stopped so that the 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.770
 team have that peace of mind and know 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.740
 who can attack her after beating 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.470
 people who are able to 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.000
 hold the rival attack what do you think 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.540
 of the driver you sell when you saw it 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.070
 first time like that if he did not avoid 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:45.470
 silent with the look down here this 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.870
 world in defense has to be like that 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.870
 fourth and I do not know how much and yet it comes out 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.580
 a very international level player 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.070
 good very good player very good person 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.530
 from the first day it's good that I 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:00.500
 I arrived and I saw him training player 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.970
 He has a lot of technique and learning a lot 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.980
 in these market issues there has 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.140
 improved more 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.600
 and eat you came to the national team 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.640
 and is still playing at this level that is 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.830
 playing will surely have great 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.560
 chances of being in the world yes 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.960
 Yes of course until the World Cup Brazil 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.110
 I believe that the three that I am 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.270
 lucky to be playing with three 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:26.090
 good four with salcido selected 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:30.260
 there are beside me not the grape and the 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:31.820
 jiménez towers nilo and salcido and I am the 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.130
 I really feel lucky to have a 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.720
 my side and surely the 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.540
 level than the level that has been keeping 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:41.150
 are going to be in the world the fact 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:45.340
 that tigers the defense looks 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:48.250
 bound by the system by the technician 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:51.570
 more than anything by the technician leaving 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:56.199
 playing everything that touch her touch the 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:58.419
 and a child suddenly see the bottom and see 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:01.389
 the opposing defense I do not know or someone 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:04.600
 I send him a message and cross the field and 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:08.430
 send over there to tito villa or to 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:12.220
 damián or danilinho as seen or 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:14.800
 long balonazo that I do not see the a 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.870
 the Brazilian teams in brazil 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.400
 play differently if the measure of 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:21.250
 brasilia a little more space for 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:24.010
 to play not team pressure 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:26.139
 rival is not as big as here is the 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:28.479
 teams will have because you more than time 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:31.240
 to think with the ball so why 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:33.340
 this is not much this type of players 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.880
 not here not here around here 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.780
 or the teams endured not even 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.600
 generally against us in our 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.669
 stadium without being too behind there 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.610
 we have that really and have the 

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:47.620
 Patience is about continuing to play and 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:50.470
 have a lot of the ball to tempt 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.910
 enter the rival defense but already 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:54.000
 when we are going to play outside in our 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:57.100
 house that rivals try to 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.820
 press us to press a little more 

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.040
 there have of 

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:03.050
 to use since using this type of 

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.390
 play suddenly surprise the 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:09.170
 rival leadership with valuing for 

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:11.000
 our forwards perfect respect the 

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.500
 public we are going to present at the 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.050
 course of the program not only 

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:17.750
 talk there are also goals from juninho that 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:19.520
 they are historic goals for cannon shots and 

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:21.350
 had closed a header goal that 

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.460
 scored the team of the striped chivas 

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:24.620
 of Guadalajara 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:27.230
 there they call you the best defense 

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:30.020
 Central of Mexico, you consider yourself the 

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:34.670
 best central defense of mexico nothing 

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:36.590
 I consider 0 player who is capable 

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:38.180
 to do things well but very 

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:40.130
 quiet in everything I do I try to 

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:43.010
 well to do my job the best that 

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:45.430
 can train to improve itself 

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:51.040
 improves every perfect game 

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:51.040
 allows a break and we return
