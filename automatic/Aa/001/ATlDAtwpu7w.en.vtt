00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 received the applause applause that 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.189
 now heard they are turned to share 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.080

 made for us for what is certain for 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.080
 that epic to hire one 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.880
 more advanced position and then a 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.609
 also favor red goals 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.609
 girone d with flattered offer it 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.960
 cabri himself with the outside looking 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:31.320
 Platini admitted to the round of barcelona 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.980
 on the other hand he had nothing to 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.850
 to lose 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.130
 then an avid and authoritative type 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.400
 perhaps more determined than ready 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.000
 physically 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:45.510
 the player of the rest of the world who 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.510
 we see that the divine 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:55.120
 during not yet active 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.120
 great many beautiful people 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.050
 kao has been stopped by junior again 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.300
 platini and we know how to do it immediately 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.040
 although the climate naturally like 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.990
 repeatedly stressed is that 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.170
 the friendly rhythm is very bland 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.240
 however there are soft touches that 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.190
 really suggest ethically 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.440
 we are seeing the work of the great 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:22.570
 samples instead tarantini puts it of 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:26.860
 head out platini today you left 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:30.860
 Cabrini children for the Argentine one 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:36.700
 and then off platini steps well 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.700
 some of the two are peabody's meanwhile 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:48.380
 tree pass them by of history but that 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:50.810
 the fake the lob resolution and goal 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.000
 very nice but movie 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.170
 to thank here is that we see Latin again 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.810
 true 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.240
 Italian instinctive genius and I would do it again but 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.340
 then here are the dogs they would like 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.140
 sketch another part if it were 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.470
 released on the assets he would have pulled into a 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.470
 other way 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.610
 I wonder if among the many Turin applauses 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.610
 it is entrusted to cause 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.890
 the complete returned the launch 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:26.480
 through a repetition and they came out 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:31.910
 still through the fim the tv counts for 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:34.220
 this drove mad with la 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.440

 the direct 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.340
 we try the lob 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:15.849
 wonderful principle red diversity too 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:20.269
 at a time when latin people 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:23.209
 recovery still tardelli applause for 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:26.329
 for all of us forward platini PlatÃ¬ 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.790
 fake on corner graziani with 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:30.469
 blocks in wright platinum in breath 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.680
 of price according to time begins in this 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:35.950
 moment with the same formation of the 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.950
 first 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:43.660
 in back boniek and platinum thread the 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:48.370
 second day 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:52.360
 the goals of the rest of the world we see again 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.370
 the action here is the blogging cross with 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.340
 all dense with ponies is that which serves 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.860
 backward very precise platinum the 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:04.450
 shot down his falcao heel-shot 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:08.560
 exercised the action of our sirens is 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:10.900
 on the other hand it seems to me highlighted 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.270
 also from these early stages of recovery 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.299
 also configure ours but it is only 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.040
 I'm more consummate actor then than 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.920
 very often these scenes the benches 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:24.400
 of the official matches made of that 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:26.530
 set challenges again for now 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:31.740
 of the days heel malaga has 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.740
 the ball for quality 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.380
 giulio then the setting for the 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:41.340
 rest of the world platini in the case of 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:46.840
 quality the platini palette sees anchored 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:49.630
 Campese recovers it then says I see in the 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:53.070
 opposite side joined platinum but red the 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.070
 as too unselfish 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:03.830
 platini did not touch a 5-phlox balloon 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:07.230
 clarified to crawl to platelets 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:14.850
 to the arrest of the supply chain but michael 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:17.690
 platini that binds naval because 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.690
 typical everything 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.139
 pepper 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.370
 the ridiculous 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:26.090
 strong made by the head 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.289
 from the floor 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.210
 let's see to all that rigor to which 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:30.979
 it would have 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:35.240
 you should trust he already has to do 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:42.699
 forget that penalty taken out to 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:46.479
 madrid best for the champions are there 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:46.479

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:12.960
 carambola still succeed platini is 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.200
 remembered in this however practically 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.540
 when you play then 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.520
 you have taken 

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.980
 the rest of the world beaten by brighton r 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:25.030
 platini blocking on the left receives 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:33.960
