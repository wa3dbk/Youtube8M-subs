00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
pick but someone else dropped it so he

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.850

that<00:04:04.680> I<00:04:04.890> figured<00:04:05.459> I<00:04:05.610> would<00:04:05.850> know<00:04:06.209> just<00:04:06.239> upgrade

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
that I figured I would know just upgrade

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.420 
that I figured I would know just upgrade
to<00:04:06.959> overalls<00:04:07.440> and<00:04:07.709> stuff<00:04:07.860> like<00:04:07.980> that<00:04:08.160> just<00:04:08.190> to

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
to overalls and stuff like that just to

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.370 
to overalls and stuff like that just to
get<00:04:08.550> better<00:04:08.760> players<00:04:09.150> cuz<00:04:09.720> they're<00:04:09.900> good<00:04:10.080> I

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
get better players cuz they're good I

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.750 
get better players cuz they're good I
could<00:04:10.739> get<00:04:10.890> better<00:04:11.040> places<00:04:11.459> at<00:04:11.520> the<00:04:11.550> same<00:04:11.700> time

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
could get better places at the same time

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.729 
could get better places at the same time
so<00:04:12.060> that<00:04:12.180> was<00:04:12.270> my<00:04:12.360> mindset<00:04:12.540> when<00:04:13.230> I<00:04:13.260> got<00:04:13.500> a<00:04:13.530> few

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
though every single time I do look at

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.310 
though every single time I do look at
the<00:05:50.910> score<00:05:51.210> a<00:05:51.479> lot<00:05:51.870> of<00:05:51.930> times<00:05:52.080> there's<00:05:52.229> always

this season that's the way it's looking

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.950 
this season that's the way it's looking
every<00:06:17.849> single<00:06:18.150> game<00:06:18.360> has<00:06:18.539> been<00:06:18.660> a<00:06:18.690> ragequit

every single game has been a ragequit
this<00:06:19.229> game<00:06:19.530> is<00:06:19.650> looking<00:06:19.770> like<00:06:20.070> it's<00:06:20.280> about<00:06:20.370> to

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:20.669 
this game is looking like it's about to

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:22.310 
this game is looking like it's about to
be<00:06:20.820> the<00:06:20.849> same<00:06:21.210> 1st<00:06:21.510> down<00:06:21.750> and<00:06:21.960> 10

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.320 
be the same 1st down and 10

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.040 
be the same 1st down and 10
it<00:06:22.740> shucks<00:06:23.250> it<00:06:23.460> up<00:06:23.610> and<00:06:23.789> drop<00:06:24.539> picked<00:06:24.810> there<00:06:24.930> by

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
it shucks it up and drop picked there by

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.560 
it shucks it up and drop picked there by
Tracy<00:06:25.380> Porter<00:06:25.770> but<00:06:26.250> second<00:06:26.729> down<00:06:26.880> and<00:06:26.970> 10<00:06:27.210> this

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.570 
Tracy Porter but second down and 10 this

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.570 
Tracy Porter but second down and 10 this
ends<00:06:27.960> up<00:06:28.020> being<00:06:28.080> the<00:06:28.320> game<00:06:28.650> and<00:06:28.950> there<00:06:29.130> Patrick

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 
ends up being the game and there Patrick

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.879 
ends up being the game and there Patrick
Willis<00:06:30.000> on<00:06:30.270> the<00:06:30.479> interception<00:06:30.990> sad<00:06:31.650> thing<00:06:31.860> is

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:31.889 
Willis on the interception sad thing is

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:33.770 
Willis on the interception sad thing is
I<00:06:32.130> think<00:06:32.310> this<00:06:32.400> is<00:06:32.520> his<00:06:32.640> last<00:06:32.909> players<00:06:33.270> vulture

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:33.780 
I think this is his last players vulture

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.810 
I think this is his last players vulture
and<00:06:33.990> it's<00:06:34.229> an<00:06:34.349> interception<00:06:34.979> so<00:06:35.580> it's<00:06:35.729> like

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:35.820 
and it's an interception so it's like

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.700 
and it's an interception so it's like
why<00:06:35.969> actually<00:06:36.270> well<00:06:36.960> I<00:06:36.990> want<00:06:37.320> to<00:06:37.440> say
