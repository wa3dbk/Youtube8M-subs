00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
I still think Mario get through and then

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.350 
I still think Mario get through and then
the<00:01:19.210> long<00:01:19.390> run<00:01:19.630> it<00:01:19.750> could<00:01:19.869> be<00:01:19.960> true<00:01:20.140> but

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
the long run it could be true but

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.750 
the long run it could be true but
a<00:01:22.420> little<00:01:22.990> too<00:01:23.110> fast<00:01:23.650> little<00:01:24.010> too<00:01:24.100> consistent

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
a little too fast little too consistent
