00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.720
 remember that 7 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.449
 a well made pasta frola has to have 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:25.230
 the separation 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.949
 Between strip and strip 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:28.710
 of the same thickness 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.390
 what's wrong with it 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.390
 said help is always equal 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.880
 the president because he has a little bit of baking powder so he's going to grow 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.750
 bit 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.050
 but always this one has to be 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.790
 agree to look 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.630

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.280
 the order 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.100

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.130
 we are going to give it to you 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.730

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.120
 Swedish I'm going to do it not crossed in squares and not in diamonds 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.120
 so I'm going to work this diagonally 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.640
 always that the distance that rally 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.979
 between a store to another society 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.440
 the one that was wide when it serves the sweet 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.740
 even though it was always 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.970
 is going to close a little bit more 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.040
 that day 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.090
 the strips can 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.330
 perfectly cut them with a knife simply by the back part of a 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.430
 first quarter pulhac

 place 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.750

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:16.459
 with the jo knife sleeve can also be 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.659

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.589
 with the heat 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:28.989
 Well, it's softening 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.230
 we give it a termination as if it were a spike 

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:36.219
 after 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:39.219
