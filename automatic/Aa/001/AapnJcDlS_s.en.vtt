00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:08.610
 outclassed almost swept to the usap which 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:15.509
 has never left the elite since 1911 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:18.260
 and tonight on the edge of the precipice was going 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.260
 a lot more things needed 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
 here 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.920
 as long as it's not finished me I want to 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.260
 believe but now here we go we go 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.180
 see we'll digest that but hey it takes 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.560
 to be a little realistic 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.780
 two hours earlier the pressure is 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.730
 already there for sofiane guitoune the test 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.650
 Remote winger knew the 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.330
 duel between oyonnax and Toulouse will require 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.500
 fire is safe at the stadium 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.230
 olympic of barcelona 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.550
 as an echo to martin fourcade 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.960
 Catalan fans and double champion 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.590
 Olympic biathlon that gave the 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.960
 kick-off 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.330
 a first quarter of an hour padlocked 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.449
 until the usap takes advantage of its 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.860
 first opportunity to analyze with diouf 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.270
 right now to trigger the game 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.450
 dynamic off with rocky your 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.930
 data in the year 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.930
 very rich people 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:17.299
 8 6 then 11 9 perpignan holds the reins 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:20.080
 but that will only last for a moment with 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.080
 garfield monica 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.260
 2 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.150
 scathing european champions 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.770
 Toulon had some dangerous 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.060
 also for the team opposite so we have 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.080
 tried to disregard his from 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.150
 put our game in place 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.260
 and then after we have managed to 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.590
 release a little more we managed to 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.780
 scoring toulon tests leads 16 to 11 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.090
 after half an hour and virgile burnished 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.530
 clink to the health of his future ex 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.450
 teammates him who for a few 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.100
 month was the flagship recruit of perpignan 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.720
 Toulon did not come to stalemate 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.640
 but the usap plays its survival then the 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.470
 frames without a voice just five minutes 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.510
 after the test of bruni guillem guirado 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.550
 pass the line like last week 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.979
 against oyonnax the Catalan captain 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.920
 entered a try him the future player of 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.420
 Toulon which is a shame is that 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.220
 every time we have one has taken the score 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.619
 and that we put them to doubt the blow 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.390
 after his first try without hanging out 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.870
 high points on rue bÃ©teille 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.370
 match the usap leads 18 to 16 after 35 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.380
 minutes but this first act of madness 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.610
 is not finished all given to a 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.860
 week of their European semifinal 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.320
 are in dress rehearsal of this rugby 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.070
 total a highlight concretized by 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.720
 david smith 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.030
 but after consulting several 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.890
 slow down the test is refused 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.220
 the New Zealander winger goes into touch 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.220
 before flattening 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.990
 it's still toulon that comes in 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.670
 head 26 18 after a penalty of 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.040
 frederic michalak and especially after a 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.070
 new test a personal feat signed 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.120
 stephen armitage h in liem say teen is 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.440
 exceeded 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.430
 these mixed lands it is possible that we 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.900
 get caught like that at one minute 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.190
 from the end we make mistakes of 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.110
 defending the cadet on first three 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.239
 playing time so are rectified the 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.409
 defense and it passed or relentlessly the 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.310
 defense and it's going to be very hard for 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:01.200
 come dominated and led usap 29 21 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.670
 after 50 minutes the Catalans who do not 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.129
 owe their salvation that at mg / kg you 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.450
 rescuers on this decisive tackle which 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:09.060
 sends armitage in dead balloon 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.959
 a short-lived rescue in the 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.690
 minute that follows 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:16.099
 rudi wulf served by frederic michalak 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.750
 crossed the line toulon then leads 36 21 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:21.000
 jean pierre perret survivors of the last 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.010
 title in 2009 beats the reminder of the troops 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.790
 but the morale is gone and toulon in 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.379
 bringing in probing unfolds in leader 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:34.620
 of the sport that spreads fred michalak the 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:37.079
 combination and the decline seems to say 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.349
 in this Olympic stadium who could we 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:41.489
 to say wait for perpignan 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.989
 certainly today we had 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.480
 case by winning against positive word is 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:49.319
 certainly not against toulon so we 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.840
 had some that our courage to their 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.220
 propose that was not enough 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.140
 a quarter of an hour before the end of the match 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.390
 the usap will seek to get closer to the 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.489
 defensive bonus mg that you enrolling there 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.590
 the third Catalan try to give back 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.489
 to this defeat an honorable 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:08.640
 but wide defeat anyway 46 31 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:10.830
 when we leave on our hunger 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.799
 today thomas against champion 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.720
 of europe it's complicated 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.750
 more than complicated we know how to measure at this 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.310
 which was best we tried 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.150
 to raise our level of play at times 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.820
 we did it and by others go there we 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.139
 was not accurate on the small 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.540
 details in defense and small 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:34.740
 mistakes but hey they're engulfed from 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.630
 montjuic olympic stadium which often has 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.030
 brought luck to perpignan and maybe 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.419
 synonymous with terminus in top 14 because for 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.419
 save
