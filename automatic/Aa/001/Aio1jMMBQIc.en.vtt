00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
this pole and then this one and then

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.109 
this pole and then this one and then
once<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.400> get<00:01:41.610> those<00:01:41.909> two<00:01:42.240> out<00:01:43.250> this<00:01:44.250> the

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
once you get those two out this the

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.719 
once you get those two out this the
third<00:01:45.420> one<00:01:45.750> is<00:01:45.990> very<00:01:46.170> hard<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.619> get<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.250> if

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
third one is very hard to get to it if

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.550 
third one is very hard to get to it if

you use a flat screwdriver behind it and

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.109 
you use a flat screwdriver behind it and
then<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.490> can<00:01:53.729> remove<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.420> female<00:01:54.930> trade

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
then you can remove the female trade

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.959 
then you can remove the female trade
which<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:57.329> this<00:01:57.540> piece<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.670> then<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.790> whole

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
which is this piece and then the whole

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.560 
which is this piece and then the whole
screw<00:02:00.420> comes<00:02:00.719> out<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.799> without<00:02:02.360> opening<00:02:03.360> up

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570
