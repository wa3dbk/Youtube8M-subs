whole site but if you go to do that then

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.120 
whole site but if you go to do that then
you<00:01:44.939> only<00:01:45.060> think<00:01:45.360> with<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.659> link<00:01:45.869> in<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.649> in

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
you only think with the link in the in

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.219 
you only think with the link in the in
the<00:01:47.189> ASC<00:01:47.880> X<00:01:48.030> file<00:01:48.299> which<00:01:48.659> you'll<00:01:48.810> find<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:49.140> the

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
the ASC X file which you'll find in the

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.800 
the ASC X file which you'll find in the
skins<00:01:49.530> folder<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.070> I'd<00:01:51.000> recommend<00:01:51.299> using<00:01:51.630> the

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
skins folder and I'd recommend using the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.800 
skins folder and I'd recommend using the
styles<00:01:52.619> skin<00:01:53.100> object<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:54.210> details<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.689> this

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
styles skin object and details of this

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.749 
styles skin object and details of this
can<00:01:54.990> be<00:01:55.079> found<00:01:55.110> on<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.920> blog<00:01:56.189> post<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.579> I've
