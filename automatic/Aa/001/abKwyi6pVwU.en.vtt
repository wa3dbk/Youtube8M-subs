00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
of this you know I think it's somewhere

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.060 
of this you know I think it's somewhere
in<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.810> UK<00:02:28.290> crowd<00:02:29.270> and<00:02:30.270> still<00:02:30.690> find<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:31.560> way<00:02:31.590> for

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
in the UK crowd and still find a way for

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.430 
in the UK crowd and still find a way for
them<00:02:32.160> to<00:02:32.220> walk<00:02:32.880> out<00:02:33.150> Victor's<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:34.140> don't<00:02:34.320> want

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
them to walk out Victor's you don't want

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.590 
them to walk out Victor's you don't want
to<00:02:34.530> beat<00:02:34.680> either<00:02:34.890> one<00:02:35.040> of<00:02:35.220> these<00:02:35.430> guys<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:36.060> think

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
to beat either one of these guys I think

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.150 
to beat either one of these guys I think
the<00:02:36.690> big<00:02:36.900> thing<00:02:36.930> for<00:02:37.170> Ryback<00:02:37.470> is<00:02:37.830> you<00:02:37.950> don't

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
the big thing for Ryback is you don't

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.680 
the big thing for Ryback is you don't
want<00:02:38.370> him<00:02:38.460> to<00:02:38.580> be<00:02:38.730> Goldberg<00:02:39.180> you<00:02:39.330> don't<00:02:39.510> want

to<00:02:39.810> be<00:02:39.960> an<00:02:40.140> undefeated<00:02:40.830> but<00:02:40.980> once<00:02:41.670> he<00:02:41.820> gets<00:02:42.000> to

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
to be an undefeated but once he gets to

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.690 
to be an undefeated but once he gets to
a<00:02:42.150> point<00:02:42.240> where<00:02:42.570> he<00:02:42.750> has<00:02:42.960> to<00:02:43.200> lose<00:02:43.380> a<00:02:43.440> match<00:02:43.830> you

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
a point where he has to lose a match you

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.240 
a point where he has to lose a match you
I'm<00:02:45.300> trying<00:02:45.810> to<00:02:45.900> think<00:02:45.930> was<00:02:46.260> WrestleMania<00:02:46.890> 29

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250
