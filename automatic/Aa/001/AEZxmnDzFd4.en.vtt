the TK or attire cocon component and
well<00:00:55.050> like<00:00:55.290> you<00:00:55.680> could<00:00:55.830> pretty<00:00:56.100> much<00:00:56.190> figure

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.580 
well like you could pretty much figure

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.270 
well like you could pretty much figure
out<00:00:56.700> how<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:56.970> is<00:00:57.030> going<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.270> go<00:00:58.010> slap<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.220> on

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
out how this is going to go slap that on

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.240 
out how this is going to go slap that on
and<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.510> does<00:01:00.780> spin<00:01:02.420> put<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.570> together<00:01:04.250> fold

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
and it does spin put that together fold

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.870 
and it does spin put that together fold
that<00:01:05.460> down<00:01:05.519> over<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.060> shoulder<00:01:06.710> or<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:08.640> can

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
that down over a shoulder or you can

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.539 
that down over a shoulder or you can
have<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:10.080> section<00:01:10.530> on<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.770> side<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.430> this

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
have this section on a side and this

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.070 
have this section on a side and this
section<00:01:11.970> on<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.119> shoulder<00:01:12.540> doesn't<00:01:12.810> really

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
section on a shoulder doesn't really

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.660 
section on a shoulder doesn't really
matter<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.789> then<00:01:14.789> this<00:01:15.350> will<00:01:16.350> go<00:01:16.950> right<00:01:17.609> down

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
matter and then this will go right down

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.080 
matter and then this will go right down
