working on a very interesting project
that<00:01:50.700> will<00:01:50.909> allow<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.390> wake<00:01:51.659> your<00:01:51.930> windows

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
that will allow you to wake your windows

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.010 
that will allow you to wake your windows
send<00:01:52.740> computer<00:01:53.189> through<00:01:53.850> voice<00:01:54.149> commands<00:01:54.600> and

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
send computer through voice commands and

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.780 
send computer through voice commands and
yeah<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.799> voice<00:01:56.009> command<00:01:56.369> will<00:01:56.490> be<00:01:56.640> a

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
yeah that voice command will be a

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.240 
yeah that voice command will be a
Cortana<00:01:57.479> we're<00:01:58.079> not<00:01:58.170> sure<00:01:58.290> exactly<00:01:58.439> what

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
Cortana we're not sure exactly what

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.069 
Cortana we're not sure exactly what
specific<00:01:59.700> hardware<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.360> will<00:02:00.540> need<00:02:00.840> from

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
specific hardware you will need from

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.780 
specific hardware you will need from
Intel<00:02:01.469> for<00:02:01.680> this<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.950> work<00:02:01.979> but<00:02:02.369> most<00:02:02.579> likely

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
Intel for this to work but most likely

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.819 
Intel for this to work but most likely
what<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.659> will<00:02:03.780> need<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:03.990> do<00:02:04.290> next<00:02:04.560> year

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
what you will need to do next year

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:05.959 
what you will need to do next year
whenever<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.189> want<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.430> renew<00:02:05.790> your

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
whenever you want to renew your

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.639 
whenever you want to renew your
computers<00:02:06.390> look<00:02:06.689> ahead<00:02:06.990> for<00:02:07.020> Intel

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
computers look ahead for Intel

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.410 
computers look ahead for Intel
processors<00:02:08.190> as<00:02:08.670> hopefully<00:02:09.209> that<00:02:09.390> is

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
processors as hopefully that is

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.809 
processors as hopefully that is
compatible<00:02:09.959> with<00:02:10.319> devices<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.459> are<00:02:11.610> being

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
compatible with devices that are being

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.950 
compatible with devices that are being
sold<00:02:12.150> right<00:02:12.270> now

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
sold right now

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.170 
sold right now
soon<00:02:13.350> but<00:02:13.740> yeah<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.430> idea<00:02:14.790> is<00:02:14.880> that<00:02:14.970> your

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
soon but yeah the idea is that your

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.640 
soon but yeah the idea is that your
computer<00:02:15.510> will<00:02:15.630> be<00:02:15.750> on<00:02:15.900> deep<00:02:16.080> sleep<00:02:16.350> you<00:02:16.530> will

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
computer will be on deep sleep you will

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.650 
computer will be on deep sleep you will
say<00:02:16.860> hey<00:02:17.010> Cortana<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.850> it'll<00:02:18.030> wake<00:02:18.270> up<00:02:18.510> as

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
say hey Cortana and it'll wake up as

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.780 
say hey Cortana and it'll wake up as
your<00:02:19.170> power<00:02:19.410> button<00:02:19.650> let's<00:02:20.190> just<00:02:20.430> see<00:02:20.550> what<00:02:20.670> we
