we<00:04:12.510> give<00:04:12.690> a<00:04:12.720> little<00:04:13.140> bit<00:04:13.260> of<00:04:13.350> a<00:04:13.440> downward

a<00:04:22.170> little<00:04:23.170> downward<00:04:23.530> action<00:04:23.710> and<00:04:24.130> then

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
a little downward action and then

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.220 
a little downward action and then

moment<00:04:44.410> where<00:04:44.530> George<00:04:44.740> gives<00:04:45.220> me<00:04:45.370> the<00:04:45.490> lift<00:04:45.700> so

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
moment where George gives me the lift so

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.490 
moment where George gives me the lift so
we<00:04:45.970> have<00:04:46.210> the<00:04:46.330> two<00:04:46.510> empuja<00:04:47.020> days<00:04:47.320> or

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
we have the two empuja days or

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.380 
we have the two empuja days or
displacements<00:04:48.340> as<00:04:48.460> we<00:04:48.580> did<00:04:48.730> earlier<00:04:49.120> in<00:04:49.270> this

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
displacements as we did earlier in this

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.170 
displacements as we did earlier in this
video<00:04:49.570> and<00:04:49.990> then<00:04:50.620> as<00:04:50.860> I<00:04:51.010> step<00:04:51.310> back<00:04:51.520> I<00:04:51.790> receive

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
video and then as I step back I receive

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.030 
video and then as I step back I receive
one<00:04:52.390> more<00:04:52.420> displacement<00:04:53.020> but<00:04:53.620> this<00:04:53.800> time

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
one more displacement but this time

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.310 
one more displacement but this time
followed<00:04:54.490> by<00:04:54.520> a<00:04:54.670> lift<00:04:55.000> so<00:04:55.630> I<00:04:55.660> can<00:04:55.960> give<00:04:56.140> it<00:04:56.170> a

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
followed by a lift so I can give it a

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.230 
followed by a lift so I can give it a
little<00:04:56.590> jump<00:04:56.860> I<00:04:57.040> try<00:04:57.250> to<00:04:57.310> use<00:04:57.640> my<00:04:57.970> right<00:04:58.180> hand

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
little jump I try to use my right hand

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.020 
little jump I try to use my right hand
and<00:04:58.750> my<00:04:58.810> left<00:04:59.170> hand<00:04:59.320> to<00:04:59.680> give<00:05:00.100> a<00:05:00.130> little<00:05:00.610> lift

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
and my left hand to give a little lift

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.720 
and my left hand to give a little lift
myself<00:05:01.660> and<00:05:01.960> then<00:05:02.800> with<00:05:02.980> the<00:05:03.100> left<00:05:03.250> foot<00:05:03.460> free

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
myself and then with the left foot free

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.380 
myself and then with the left foot free
it<00:05:03.850> comes<00:05:04.060> down<00:05:04.390> and<00:05:04.720> goes<00:05:05.200> around<00:05:05.350> my<00:05:05.770> partner

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
it comes down and goes around my partner

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:11.460 
it comes down and goes around my partner
good<00:05:07.390> in<00:05:07.570> see<00:05:07.780> ya<00:05:07.900> side<00:05:08.560> three<00:05:09.520> four<00:05:10.210> five<00:05:10.870> six

good in see ya side three four five six

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.530 
good in see ya side three four five six
maybe<00:05:12.190> shout<00:05:12.520> it<00:05:12.610> from<00:05:12.640> this<00:05:12.940> direction

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:13.540 
maybe shout it from this direction

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.510 
maybe shout it from this direction
and<00:05:13.870> this<00:05:14.200> time<00:05:14.440> maybe<00:05:14.590> without<00:05:14.830> stopping

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
and this time maybe without stopping

and this time maybe without stopping
you'll<00:05:15.670> see<00:05:15.880> it<00:05:15.970> a<00:05:16.030> little<00:05:16.300> clearer<00:05:16.600> two<00:05:17.020> three

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
you'll see it a little clearer two three

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.520 
you'll see it a little clearer two three
into<00:05:18.100> the<00:05:18.220> empanada<00:05:18.730> and<00:05:19.000> for<00:05:19.270> her<00:05:19.530> empanadas

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
into the empanada and for her empanadas

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.010 
into the empanada and for her empanadas
that's<00:05:20.770> an<00:05:20.920> Argentine<00:05:21.490> meal

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
that's an Argentine meal

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.370 
that's an Argentine meal
this<00:05:23.020> is<00:05:23.200> empanadas<00:05:24.130> a<00:05:24.160> displacement<00:05:25.380> okay

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
this is empanadas a displacement okay

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.680 
this is empanadas a displacement okay
let's<00:05:27.010> do<00:05:27.130> it<00:05:27.190> again<00:05:29.640> so<00:05:30.640> nice<00:05:30.880> sharp<00:05:31.210> movement

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
let's do it again so nice sharp movement

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.530 
let's do it again so nice sharp movement
quick<00:05:32.260> quick<00:05:32.530> quick<00:05:33.340> quick<00:05:33.430> and<00:05:33.910> from<00:05:34.330> here<00:05:34.510> a

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:34.540 
quick quick quick quick and from here a

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:39.290 
quick quick quick quick and from here a
little<00:05:34.660> downward<00:05:35.470> and<00:05:35.650> up<00:05:35.770> action<00:05:36.250> a<00:05:37.920> check

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
little downward and up action a check

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:44.690 
little downward and up action a check
side<00:05:40.530> and<00:05:41.530> finish<00:05:42.780> with<00:05:43.780> the<00:05:43.870> end<00:05:43.990> of<00:05:44.050> the<00:05:44.110> box

side and finish with the end of the box

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.370 
side and finish with the end of the box
this<00:05:45.700> is<00:05:45.760> a<00:05:45.940> movement<00:05:46.480> that<00:05:46.690> we<00:05:46.870> would<00:05:47.020> do<00:05:47.140> only

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
this is a movement that we would do only

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.690 
this is a movement that we would do only
when<00:05:47.590> we<00:05:47.680> have<00:05:47.830> enough<00:05:48.070> space<00:05:48.310> and<00:05:48.580> them

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:48.700 
when we have enough space and them

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.610 
when we have enough space and them
crowded<00:05:49.060> me<00:05:49.330> longer<00:05:49.540> when<00:05:49.990> it's<00:05:50.110> not<00:05:50.350> crowded

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
crowded me longer when it's not crowded

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.940 
crowded me longer when it's not crowded

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 
to yourself to be sure that we don't

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.130 
to yourself to be sure that we don't
kick<00:05:56.980> others<00:05:57.340> around<00:05:57.610> us<00:05:57.820> but<00:05:58.540> it<00:05:58.660> certainly

00:05:59.130 --> 00:05:59.140

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
is a fun step to do when you know that

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.690 
is a fun step to do when you know that
there's<00:06:02.890> space<00:06:03.010> to<00:06:03.370> do<00:06:03.520> it<00:06:04.470> three<00:06:05.470> four<00:06:06.040> five

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:06.700
