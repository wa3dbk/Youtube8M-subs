00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.990
 French you then 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.080
 yo guests choose the seven nl here 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.730
 with a committee right away it is 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.699
 actually something special because if you 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.470
 looks at a month or two and three 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.760
 ago in the header community in the Netherlands 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.070
 was just 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.300
 live videos ok myself and not live me 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.340
 did not just have to do live id 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.329
 also just a lot of let's plays a 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.489
 gta 6 and scree too so that gave up on that 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.920
 a dead end in the cat criticism 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.579
 actually within the basket community want 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.070
 Yes 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.170
 work as two is common throughout the community 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.730
 one we failed that concerns we say int 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.140
 and the entire city the game just so it is 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.210
 for youtube something nice that you just 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.949
 not a moment i hear you could few 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.360
 I think making really good tip videos 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.010
 personally think that you have more like 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.199
 clean and kem strike or op him in the 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.730
 game is sometimes with mw3 then you just have 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.109
 more options if you like youtubers 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.780
 could say the food and you notice it 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.760
 just w31 could be a year in itself 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.200
 stay for a long time and with space or two 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.070
 it was not the case and people went 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.750
 make too many random crazy videos 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.549
 because your own start with me either 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.619
 knew what you had to do to make every day beautiful 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.090
 and nice video to upload and now 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.950
 you just see that i'm actually the only one 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.900
 where pixie is now has call of duty 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.180
 commentary taste right now is good 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.640
 I think I want to continue with syria 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.810
 ill also indicates year i make by one 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.549
 scene training is going to do house it 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.110
 I felt awkward on the ps4 now 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.299
 just play because nothing and 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.070
 Only then I can not get well 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.570
 I still do a budget for you and me 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.040
 I still have my old account 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.479
 it's nothing and built mine 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.369
 temporarily accountant you this too 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.040
 gameplay though this gameplay is from think 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.750
 about a day or three ago, because they are 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.640
 short gameplay sees it's teamweb 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.560
 people overlord or burr confused and 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.880
 is more to show that gets over 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.130
 maybe not i have to be real 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.009
 I finished jesus worse but the 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.630
 people are so high passive and this folder 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.729

 They first game the afternoon and afternoon 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.120
 that's a total of all four hours 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.680

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.000

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.010

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.220
 often just by random bullshit but 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.420

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.970
