connect this bitch fries click file open

00:01:54.079 --> 00:02:16.150 
connect this bitch fries click file open
find<00:01:55.079> your<00:01:55.200> BIOS<00:01:55.470> file

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.240 

so<00:02:17.030> after<00:02:17.360> that<00:02:17.510> it<00:02:17.810> should<00:02:17.870> be<00:02:18.260> green<00:02:18.620> it<00:02:18.980> will

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
so after that it should be green it will

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.100 
so after that it should be green it will
slow<00:02:19.460> down<00:02:19.490> quite<00:02:20.060> a<00:02:20.090> bit<00:02:20.210> so<00:02:20.540> speed<00:02:20.870> back<00:02:21.080> up

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
slow down quite a bit so speed back up

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:27.670 
slow down quite a bit so speed back up
adoptions<00:02:22.300> speed<00:02:23.300> throttle<00:02:24.790> 200<00:02:26.350> see<00:02:27.350> it<00:02:27.440> pops

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
adoptions speed throttle 200 see it pops

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.530 
adoptions speed throttle 200 see it pops
back<00:02:27.950> up<00:02:28.010> to<00:02:28.280> 100<00:02:28.640> so<00:02:28.850> same<00:02:29.150> thing<00:02:29.330> for<00:02:29.450> this

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
back up to 100 so same thing for this

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:58.160 
back up to 100 so same thing for this
one<00:02:30.670> except<00:02:31.670> same<00:02:31.850> thing

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.300 

so<00:02:59.170> at<00:02:59.290> this<00:02:59.469> point<00:02:59.739> you<00:02:59.920> should<00:02:59.950> get<00:03:00.280> that

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
so at this point you should get that

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.509 
so at this point you should get that
right<00:03:00.849> there<00:03:02.129> and<00:03:03.129> do<00:03:03.310> that<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:05.489> you<00:03:06.489> should

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
right there and do that and you should

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.449 
right there and do that and you should
be<00:03:06.969> linked<00:03:07.450> it<00:03:08.049> would<00:03:08.560> sort<00:03:08.980> go<00:03:09.099> a<00:03:09.129> little<00:03:09.310> bit

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
be linked it would sort go a little bit

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.149 
be linked it would sort go a little bit
slower<00:03:09.730> so<00:03:09.849> you<00:03:10.000> just<00:03:10.200> bump<00:03:11.200> it<00:03:11.379> up<00:03:11.469> with<00:03:11.739> a

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:12.159 
slower so you just bump it up with a

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:16.589 
slower so you just bump it up with a
throttle<00:03:13.030> put<00:03:13.480> it<00:03:13.540> back<00:03:13.689> of<00:03:13.840> 200<00:03:14.439> and<00:03:15.599> then

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
throttle put it back of 200 and then

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:23.280 
throttle put it back of 200 and then
you're<00:03:16.780> 100%<00:03:17.260> right<00:03:17.739> here<00:03:19.019> hopefully<00:03:22.290> and
