that<00:02:12.560> is<00:02:12.890> not<00:02:13.220> legal<00:02:13.700> you<00:02:14.360> get<00:02:14.570> two<00:02:14.900> faults<00:02:15.260> and

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
that is not legal you get two faults and

with<00:04:09.320> a<00:04:09.350> receiver<00:04:09.890> so<00:04:10.100> the<00:04:10.190> receiver<00:04:10.550> comes
