I've been working on it's a proof of

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.230 
I've been working on it's a proof of
concept<00:00:15.150> if<00:00:15.570> you<00:00:15.690> add<00:00:16.609> the<00:00:17.609> first<00:00:17.880> off<00:00:18.119> I<00:00:18.210> just

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
concept if you add the first off I just

or<00:00:21.210> character<00:00:21.779> design<00:00:22.609> it's<00:00:23.609> just<00:00:23.820> about

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
or character design it's just about

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.589 
or character design it's just about
possibilities<00:00:25.460> to<00:00:26.460> make<00:00:26.789> your<00:00:27.000> characters<00:00:27.449> in

because I'm just bored of doing
replacement<00:00:38.640> animation<00:00:39.170> drawing<00:00:40.170> loads<00:00:40.350> of

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
replacement animation drawing loads of

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.680 
replacement animation drawing loads of
stuff<00:00:40.680> I'd<00:00:40.890> rather<00:00:41.070> just<00:00:41.280> make<00:00:41.430> one<00:00:41.670> model<00:00:41.850> and

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
stuff I'd rather just make one model and

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.330 
stuff I'd rather just make one model and
be<00:00:42.809> able<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.170> position<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.770> wherever<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.190> like

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
be able to position it wherever I like

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.029 
be able to position it wherever I like
although<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.700> early<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:48.270> geez<00:00:48.739> still<00:00:49.739> it

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
although this is early so geez still it

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.340 
although this is early so geez still it
looks<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.460> bit<00:00:50.489> dead<00:00:50.940> when<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.809> use<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.199> which

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
looks a bit dead when you use it which

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.389 
looks a bit dead when you use it which
is<00:00:52.469> sum<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.620> money<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.980> work<00:00:53.100> on<00:00:53.899> it<00:00:54.899> proves

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
is sum of money to work on it proves

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.389 
is sum of money to work on it proves
that<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.550> can<00:00:56.579> be<00:00:56.850> done<00:00:57.079> with<00:00:58.079> quite<00:00:59.010> simple

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
that it can be done with quite simple

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.939 
that it can be done with quite simple
scripting<00:00:59.789> actually<00:01:02.840> you<00:01:03.840> just<00:01:03.870> few<00:01:04.710> shots

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
scripting actually you just few shots

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.830 
scripting actually you just few shots
I've<00:01:05.129> done<00:01:05.280> like<00:01:05.519> say<00:01:05.790> not<00:01:06.540> very<00:01:06.720> good

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
I've done like say not very good

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.080 
I've done like say not very good
animation<00:01:07.320> not<00:01:07.770> very<00:01:07.950> good<00:01:08.100> character<00:01:08.790> design

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
animation not very good character design

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.710 
animation not very good character design
but<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.810> just<00:01:09.960> proves<00:01:11.210> yeah<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:12.390> I'm<00:01:12.450> not<00:01:12.600> very

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
but it just proves yeah so I'm not very

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.350 
but it just proves yeah so I'm not very
good<00:01:12.780> at<00:01:12.900> emotion<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.680> proves<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.189> works<00:01:14.960> ok<00:01:17.360> so

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
good at emotion it proves it works ok so

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.030 
good at emotion it proves it works ok so
what<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.540> have<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:19.049> I've<00:01:19.320> made<00:01:20.100> my<00:01:20.280> model<00:01:20.610> in

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
what I have is I've made my model in

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.469 
what I have is I've made my model in
Maya<00:01:23.040> like<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.520> could<00:01:23.640> make<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.939> in<00:01:24.090> whatever

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
Maya like you could make it in whatever

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.840 
Maya like you could make it in whatever
and<00:01:25.110> I've<00:01:25.860> rendered<00:01:26.130> out<00:01:26.340> movies<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:28.820> kind<00:01:29.820> of

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
and I've rendered out movies of kind of

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.850 
and I've rendered out movies of kind of
turnarounds<00:01:30.630> basically

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
turnarounds basically

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.470 
turnarounds basically
then<00:01:34.130> there's<00:01:35.130> some<00:01:35.280> simple<00:01:35.670> scripting<00:01:36.120> I've

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:36.480 
then there's some simple scripting I've

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.350 
then there's some simple scripting I've
got<00:01:36.660> this<00:01:36.810> one<00:01:37.430> central<00:01:38.430> set<00:01:38.640> up<00:01:38.820> which<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.180> can

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
got this one central set up which I can

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.260 
got this one central set up which I can
drop<00:01:39.540> into<00:01:39.750> anything<00:01:40.050> in<00:01:40.260> anime<00:01:40.790> where<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:41.820> can

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
drop into anything in anime where I can

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.990 
drop into anything in anime where I can
control<00:01:43.040> things<00:01:44.040> like<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.460> blink<00:01:46.940> where<00:01:47.940> the

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
control things like the blink where the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.840 
control things like the blink where the
