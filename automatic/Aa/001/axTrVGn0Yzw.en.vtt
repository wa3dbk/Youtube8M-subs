00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.150 
right if you find something for 10 bucks
in<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.820> CBD<00:02:03.180> area<00:02:03.300> you<00:02:04.229> can<00:02:04.470> probably<00:02:04.710> guess

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
in the CBD area you can probably guess

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.340 
in the CBD area you can probably guess
that<00:02:05.190> the<00:02:05.460> original<00:02:05.940> price<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.180> like<00:02:06.660> 20<00:02:07.080> plus

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
that the original price is like 20 plus

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.669 
that the original price is like 20 plus
or<00:02:07.680> even<00:02:07.920> thirty<00:02:08.160> plus<00:02:08.429> cos<00:02:08.780> 10<00:02:09.780> for<00:02:10.259> original

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
or even thirty plus cos 10 for original

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.199 
or even thirty plus cos 10 for original
price<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:11.130> quite<00:02:11.280> impossible<00:02:11.489> because

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
price is quite impossible because

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.990 
price is quite impossible because
everything<00:02:12.750> there<00:02:12.930> is<00:02:13.110> expensive<00:02:13.850> from<00:02:14.850> my

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
everything there is expensive from my

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.680 
everything there is expensive from my
experience<00:02:15.830> and<00:02:16.830> I<00:02:16.950> got<00:02:17.190> this<00:02:17.430> baseball<00:02:18.420> cap

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690

only<00:02:22.440> is<00:02:22.800> that<00:02:23.130> even<00:02:23.459> boogies<00:02:23.880> you<00:02:24.030> need<00:02:24.180> to

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
only is that even boogies you need to

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.320 
only is that even boogies you need to
pay<00:02:24.510> at<00:02:24.720> least<00:02:25.019> five<00:02:25.380> or<00:02:25.680> six<00:02:25.950> so<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:26.790> thought<00:02:27.269> it

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
pay at least five or six so I thought it

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.620 
pay at least five or six so I thought it
was<00:02:27.420> quite<00:02:27.570> okay<00:02:27.989> and<00:02:28.230> you<00:02:28.500> can<00:02:28.620> adjust<00:02:29.100> the

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
was quite okay and you can adjust the

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.550 
was quite okay and you can adjust the
movies<00:02:31.340> like<00:02:32.340> at<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.760> back<00:02:32.910> with<00:02:33.120> Velcro<00:02:33.660> so<00:02:34.140> I

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
movies like at the back with Velcro so I

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.280 
movies like at the back with Velcro so I
tested<00:02:35.160> my<00:02:35.190> tester<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.150> I<00:02:36.360> had<00:02:36.600> to<00:02:36.750> go<00:02:36.930> here

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
tested my tester and I had to go here

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.430 
tested my tester and I had to go here
the<00:02:38.010> very<00:02:38.250> biggest<00:02:38.760> one<00:02:39.060> but<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.600> hope<00:02:39.900> it's<00:02:40.350> not

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
the very biggest one but I hope it's not

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.410
