multiplayer<00:02:22.840> is<00:02:23.170> very<00:02:23.500> much<00:02:23.710> like<00:02:23.890> Crysis<00:02:24.370> 2

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400

as I mentioned previously a lot of

to personally I really enjoyed the

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.270 
to personally I really enjoyed the
single-player<00:02:31.540> of<00:02:31.860> crisis<00:02:32.860> to<00:02:33.070> the

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
multiplayer wasn't quite my cup of tea

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.100

one<00:02:36.850> of<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.030> biggest<00:02:37.270> problems<00:02:37.720> I<00:02:37.780> had<00:02:37.960> with

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
one of the biggest problems I had with

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.440 
one of the biggest problems I had with
it<00:02:38.290> was<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.590> absolutely<00:02:39.430> insane<00:02:40.000> bullet

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
it was the absolutely insane bullet

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.290 
it was the absolutely insane bullet
damage<00:02:40.570> where<00:02:41.440> a<00:02:41.710> single<00:02:42.070> toe<00:02:42.400> shot<00:02:42.670> wood

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
damage where a single toe shot wood

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.910

floor<00:02:43.600> you<00:02:43.780> that<00:02:44.380> seem<00:02:44.620> so<00:02:44.770> you've<00:02:44.890> been

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
floor you that seem so you've been

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.220 
floor you that seem so you've been
adjusted<00:02:45.550> slightly<00:02:45.670> in<00:02:46.000> Crysis<00:02:46.420> 3<00:02:46.450> and<00:02:46.810> you

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
adjusted slightly in Crysis 3 and you

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.170 
adjusted slightly in Crysis 3 and you
can<00:02:47.380> now<00:02:47.560> take<00:02:47.620> a<00:02:47.830> few<00:02:48.160> more<00:02:48.400> rounds<00:02:48.610> you<00:02:48.970> could

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
can now take a few more rounds you could

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.050 
can now take a few more rounds you could
in<00:02:49.300> crisis<00:02:49.750> too<00:02:49.960> so<00:02:50.680> it's<00:02:50.980> not<00:02:51.280> as<00:02:51.460> frustrating

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
in crisis too so it's not as frustrating

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
in particular the insane bullet damage

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.580 
in particular the insane bullet damage
so<00:03:49.030> this<00:03:49.330> looks<00:03:49.780> like<00:03:50.020> it's<00:03:50.200> going<00:03:50.350> to<00:03:50.440> be<00:03:50.560> a

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
so this looks like it's going to be a

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.190 
so this looks like it's going to be a
more<00:03:50.890> enjoyable<00:03:51.120> joya<00:03:52.120> Balmora<00:03:52.570> play<00:03:52.900> a<00:03:52.930> game

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
more enjoyable joya Balmora play a game

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.800 
more enjoyable joya Balmora play a game
mode<00:03:53.410> to<00:03:53.560> play<00:03:53.760> my<00:03:54.760> favorite<00:03:55.209> game<00:03:55.330> mode<00:03:55.660> at

the<00:03:55.870> moment<00:03:55.930> is<00:03:56.410> crash<00:03:56.860> site<00:03:57.130> I<00:03:57.340> think<00:03:58.030> that

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
the moment is crash site I think that

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.910 
the moment is crash site I think that
comes<00:03:58.420> more<00:03:58.810> from<00:03:58.840> the<00:03:59.170> fact<00:03:59.380> that<00:03:59.470> it<00:03:59.680> kind<00:03:59.890> of

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
comes more from the fact that it kind of

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.500 
comes more from the fact that it kind of
feels<00:04:00.040> very<00:04:00.370> conquest<00:04:00.910> II<00:04:01.060> for<00:04:01.240> those<00:04:01.360> you

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
feels very conquest II for those you

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.510 
feels very conquest II for those you
guys<00:04:01.750> that<00:04:01.930> have<00:04:02.020> played<00:04:02.200> battlefield<00:04:02.620> where

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
guys that have played battlefield where

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.110 
guys that have played battlefield where
you<00:04:03.850> capture<00:04:04.300> and<00:04:04.450> hold<00:04:04.950> crash<00:04:05.950> pods<00:04:06.250> so<00:04:07.000> it

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
you capture and hold crash pods so it

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.060 
you capture and hold crash pods so it
kind<00:04:07.300> of<00:04:07.390> has<00:04:07.510> a<00:04:07.540> sort<00:04:08.080> of<00:04:08.110> conquest<00:04:08.560> feel<00:04:08.770> to

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
kind of has a sort of conquest feel to

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.040 
kind of has a sort of conquest feel to
it<00:04:09.100> so<00:04:09.970> if<00:04:10.270> you've<00:04:10.450> played<00:04:10.720> battlefield

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
it so if you've played battlefield

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.680

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.380 
run a amazingly demanding resolution and
I'm<00:05:04.770> noticing<00:05:04.980> that<00:05:05.520> there<00:05:06.060> are<00:05:06.120> quite<00:05:06.240> a<00:05:06.300> few

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
I'm noticing that there are quite a few

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.960 
I'm noticing that there are quite a few
times<00:05:06.750> during<00:05:07.050> the<00:05:07.290> game<00:05:07.470> where<00:05:08.130> GPU<00:05:08.670> usage

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
times during the game where GPU usage

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.330 
times during the game where GPU usage
just<00:05:09.630> seemed<00:05:09.870> to<00:05:10.020> drop<00:05:10.290> for<00:05:10.500> no<00:05:10.800> apparent

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
just seemed to drop for no apparent

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.030 
just seemed to drop for no apparent
reason<00:05:11.400> so<00:05:12.330> i<00:05:12.360> think<00:05:12.480> the<00:05:12.810> Crytek<00:05:13.410> stroke

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
reason so i think the Crytek stroke

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.670 
reason so i think the Crytek stroke
nvidia<00:05:14.520> may<00:05:15.120> still<00:05:15.420> have<00:05:15.570> some<00:05:15.600> up<00:05:15.930> optimizing

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
nvidia may still have some up optimizing

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.860 
nvidia may still have some up optimizing
to<00:05:16.800> do<00:05:16.920> for<00:05:17.310> the<00:05:17.430> game<00:05:17.610> as<00:05:17.820> there<00:05:18.600> are<00:05:18.720> more

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
to do for the game as there are more

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.960 
to do for the game as there are more
than<00:05:18.960> a<00:05:19.050> few<00:05:19.200> occasions<00:05:19.740> where<00:05:20.550> my<00:05:20.670> framerate

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
than a few occasions where my framerate

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.570 
than a few occasions where my framerate
took<00:05:21.450> a<00:05:21.540> dive<00:05:21.720> and<00:05:21.960> i<00:05:22.560> notice<00:05:22.920> that<00:05:23.040> my<00:05:23.130> GPU

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
took a dive and i notice that my GPU

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.580 
took a dive and i notice that my GPU
usage<00:05:23.790> was<00:05:24.090> taking<00:05:24.420> a<00:05:24.480> dive<00:05:24.690> as<00:05:24.840> well<00:05:24.990> so<00:05:25.560> i

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
usage was taking a dive as well so i

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:26.630 
usage was taking a dive as well so i
still<00:05:25.860> feel<00:05:26.070> that<00:05:26.130> there<00:05:26.400> are<00:05:26.490> more

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
still feel that there are more

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.460 
still feel that there are more
optimizations<00:05:27.210> that<00:05:27.540> can<00:05:27.810> be<00:05:27.900> made<00:05:28.080> for<00:05:28.320> the

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
optimizations that can be made for the

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.500 
optimizations that can be made for the
game<00:05:28.680> and<00:05:29.010> hopefully<00:05:29.850> those<00:05:30.210> optimizations

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
game and hopefully those optimizations

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.470 
game and hopefully those optimizations
will<00:05:31.200> take<00:05:31.470> me<00:05:31.710> from<00:05:31.920> the<00:05:32.460> sort<00:05:32.700> of<00:05:32.760> low<00:05:33.030> stroke

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:33.480 
will take me from the sort of low stroke

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.230 
will take me from the sort of low stroke

that<00:06:01.860> is<00:06:01.980> for<00:06:02.190> sure<00:06:02.220> but<00:06:03.150> there<00:06:03.330> is<00:06:03.450> some

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630 
that is for sure but there is some

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.330 
that is for sure but there is some

the performance of the game which is

the performance of the game which is
something<00:06:08.730> that<00:06:08.940> I'm<00:06:09.030> saying<00:06:09.300> a<00:06:09.420> lot<00:06:09.540> of

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:56.310 
in this game one of the problems that I

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.670 
in this game one of the problems that I
have<00:06:56.490> with<00:06:56.759> the<00:06:57.270> multiplayer<00:06:57.810> which<00:06:58.169> is<00:06:58.319> more

00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 
have with the multiplayer which is more

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.240 
have with the multiplayer which is more
me<00:06:59.099> is<00:06:59.849> the<00:07:00.210> the<00:07:00.960> kind<00:07:01.229> of<00:07:01.380> slowness<00:07:01.740> at<00:07:02.099> which

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:02.250 
me is the the kind of slowness at which

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:04.210 
me is the the kind of slowness at which
you<00:07:02.430> seem<00:07:02.639> to<00:07:02.669> move<00:07:02.940> I<00:07:03.150> know<00:07:03.270> that<00:07:03.539> you<00:07:03.599> can

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:04.220 
you seem to move I know that you can

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.159 
you seem to move I know that you can
increase<00:07:05.220> that<00:07:05.520> by<00:07:05.840> adjusting<00:07:06.840> your

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:07.169 
increase that by adjusting your

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:08.770 
increase that by adjusting your
sensitivity<00:07:07.770> and<00:07:07.889> things<00:07:08.099> like<00:07:08.250> that<00:07:08.310> but

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:08.780 
sensitivity and things like that but

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.059 
sensitivity and things like that but
generally<00:07:09.780> you<00:07:09.930> seem<00:07:10.139> to<00:07:10.319> be<00:07:10.590> able<00:07:10.650> to<00:07:10.860> only

00:07:11.059 --> 00:07:11.069 
generally you seem to be able to only

00:07:11.069 --> 00:07:13.730 
generally you seem to be able to only
turn<00:07:11.370> round<00:07:11.610> so<00:07:11.970> quick<00:07:12.300> and<00:07:12.509> that<00:07:13.409> kind<00:07:13.650> of

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:13.740 
turn round so quick and that kind of

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.499 
turn round so quick and that kind of
gets<00:07:13.919> me<00:07:13.979> killed<00:07:14.250> an<00:07:14.430> awful<00:07:14.789> lot<00:07:14.940> I<00:07:15.120> like<00:07:15.360> the

00:07:15.499 --> 00:07:15.509 
gets me killed an awful lot I like the

00:07:15.509 --> 00:07:18.740 
gets me killed an awful lot I like the
ability<00:07:15.690> to<00:07:16.530> be<00:07:16.650> able<00:07:16.770> to<00:07:16.949> do<00:07:17.039> a<00:07:17.069> 180<00:07:17.659> sort<00:07:18.659> of

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:18.750 
ability to be able to do a 180 sort of

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.740 
ability to be able to do a 180 sort of
just<00:07:19.139> like<00:07:19.319> that<00:07:19.620> you<00:07:19.830> know<00:07:19.949> when<00:07:20.130> I<00:07:20.159> feel<00:07:20.460> like

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:20.750 
just like that you know when I feel like

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:25.010 
just like that you know when I feel like
the<00:07:21.750> aiming<00:07:22.409> is<00:07:22.560> good<00:07:23.430> when<00:07:24.389> you're<00:07:24.539> firing<00:07:24.750> it

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:25.020 
the aiming is good when you're firing it

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.600 
the aiming is good when you're firing it
anything<00:07:25.289> more<00:07:25.590> than<00:07:25.680> close<00:07:25.889> quarters<00:07:26.430> though

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:26.610 
anything more than close quarters though

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:28.430 
anything more than close quarters though
and<00:07:26.880> you're<00:07:27.030> aiming<00:07:27.270> down<00:07:27.389> the<00:07:27.449> sights<00:07:27.599> it

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.440 
and you're aiming down the sights it

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.260 
and you're aiming down the sights it
becomes<00:07:28.740> a<00:07:28.889> bit<00:07:29.009> hit-and-miss<00:07:29.220> when<00:07:30.090> you're

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:30.270 
becomes a bit hit-and-miss when you're

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:52.830 
annoying but usually well that kind of

takes<00:07:53.009> advantage<00:07:53.580> of<00:07:53.699> the<00:07:53.820> fact<00:07:54.030> that<00:07:54.770> medium

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:55.770 
takes advantage of the fact that medium

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:57.890 
takes advantage of the fact that medium
range<00:07:55.979> shooting<00:07:56.460> is<00:07:56.759> so<00:07:57.000> so<00:07:57.270> unless<00:07:57.300> you<00:07:57.750> do<00:07:57.870> it

00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:57.900 
range shooting is so so unless you do it
