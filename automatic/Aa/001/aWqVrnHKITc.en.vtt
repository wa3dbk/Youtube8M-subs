00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.870 
to do a two inch thick well takes you 24

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.690 
to do a two inch thick well takes you 24
hours<00:01:26.900> you<00:01:27.740> do<00:01:27.920> it<00:01:28.040> with<00:01:28.160> a<00:01:28.190> thing<00:01:28.400> called<00:01:28.610> an

hours you do it with a thing called an

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.510 
hours you do it with a thing called an
orbital<00:01:29.150> welder<00:01:29.540> which<00:01:30.470> is<00:01:30.710> computer<00:01:31.490> driven

it<00:01:32.030> just<00:01:32.210> keeps<00:01:32.480> on<00:01:32.630> going

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
it just keeps on going

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
every platform and escalators so you

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:23.940 
every platform and escalators so you

platform's at this level here is roughly

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.110 
platform's at this level here is roughly
another<00:03:28.500> foot<00:03:29.500> of<00:03:29.830> concrete<00:03:31.140> plus<00:03:32.140> the<00:03:32.560> tracks

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
plus to the platform level we still got

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.880 
plus to the platform level we still got
a<00:03:49.000> little<00:03:49.120> do<00:03:49.390> yet<00:03:49.750> but<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:50.050> basement<00:03:50.230> so<00:03:50.680> far

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
a little do yet but the basement so far

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.560 
a little do yet but the basement so far
we've<00:03:51.070> poured<00:03:51.280> about<00:03:51.430> ninety<00:03:51.850> thousand<00:03:52.300> cubic

we've poured about ninety thousand cubic
yards<00:03:52.600> of<00:03:52.930> concrete<00:03:53.370> will<00:03:54.370> be<00:03:54.400> over<00:03:54.760> a<00:03:54.790> hundred

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150

yards of concrete will be over a hundred
thousand<00:03:55.540> when<00:03:55.660> we<00:03:55.780> finished<00:03:56.080> the<00:03:56.200> train<00:03:56.440> box

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:08.190 
thousand when we finished the train box
108,000<00:03:58.500> it<00:03:59.500> is<00:03:59.590> an<00:03:59.680> amazing<00:04:00.040> project<00:04:00.220> yeah

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.030 

I<00:04:09.930> started<00:04:10.930> meeting<00:04:11.080> with<00:04:11.379> a<00:04:11.410> high-speed<00:04:11.620> rail

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
I started meeting with a high-speed rail

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.210 
I started meeting with a high-speed rail
group<00:04:12.340> right<00:04:12.940> after<00:04:13.330> 2004<00:04:14.200> and<00:04:14.440> the

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
group right after 2004 and the

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.890 
group right after 2004 and the
relationship<00:04:15.730> basically<00:04:16.209> is<00:04:16.269> has<00:04:16.570> been<00:04:16.870> a

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
relationship basically is has been a

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.050 
relationship basically is has been a
pretty<00:04:17.410> cordial<00:04:17.859> one<00:04:18.070> it's<00:04:18.549> it's<00:04:18.790> a<00:04:18.910> long

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
pretty cordial one it's it's a long

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.120 
pretty cordial one it's it's a long
processes<00:04:19.660> a<00:04:19.840> lot<00:04:19.930> of<00:04:20.169> design<00:04:20.530> decisions<00:04:20.739> that

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
processes a lot of design decisions that

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.080 
processes a lot of design decisions that
have<00:04:21.340> to<00:04:21.370> be<00:04:21.519> made

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
have to be made

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.719 
have to be made
most<00:04:23.020> of<00:04:23.200> those<00:04:23.290> are<00:04:23.530> over<00:04:23.860> now<00:04:23.950> as<00:04:24.190> you<00:04:24.610> can

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
most of those are over now as you can

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.700 
most of those are over now as you can
see<00:04:24.790> when<00:04:25.450> you<00:04:25.540> go<00:04:25.660> on<00:04:25.720> this<00:04:25.900> trip<00:04:26.110> the

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
see when you go on this trip the

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.110 
see when you go on this trip the
concrete's<00:04:27.130> in<00:04:27.250> the<00:04:27.370> ground<00:04:27.580> it's<00:04:27.820> too<00:04:27.940> late

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
concrete's in the ground it's too late

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.260 
concrete's in the ground it's too late
to<00:04:28.270> change<00:04:28.450> now<00:04:28.740> this<00:04:29.740> is<00:04:29.950> where<00:04:30.160> it<00:04:30.310> has<00:04:30.910> to<00:04:31.120> go

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
to change now this is where it has to go

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.270 
to change now this is where it has to go
as<00:04:31.810> our<00:04:31.990> agency<00:04:32.440> is<00:04:32.530> actually<00:04:32.710> building<00:04:33.190> the

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
every good everybody fits in comfortable
and<00:04:41.190> so<00:04:42.190> sometimes<00:04:42.610> one<00:04:43.060> ends<00:04:43.389> up<00:04:43.479> as<00:04:43.780> the<00:04:43.990> as

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
and so sometimes one ends up as the as

and so sometimes one ends up as the as
the<00:04:44.889> negotiated<00:04:45.580> between<00:04:45.729> Caltrain<00:04:46.389> and

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
the negotiated between Caltrain and

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.200 
the negotiated between Caltrain and
high-speed<00:04:47.200> rail<00:04:47.229> so<00:04:47.950> they<00:04:48.160> both<00:04:48.340> get<00:04:48.820> the<00:04:49.060> map

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
high-speed rail so they both get the map
