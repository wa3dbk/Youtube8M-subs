PC wizkid here with the new ocz vertex
for<00:00:16.390> 60<00:00:16.930> so<00:00:17.440> this<00:00:17.800> is<00:00:18.010> the<00:00:18.280> second<00:00:18.820> in<00:00:18.910> line<00:00:18.940> I

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:19.180 
for 60 so this is the second in line I

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.929 
for 60 so this is the second in line I
guess<00:00:19.570> from<00:00:19.750> the<00:00:19.900> top<00:00:20.080> line<00:00:20.380> series<00:00:20.710> that<00:00:20.980> OCC

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:21.939

3<00:00:57.430> the<00:00:57.670> m10<00:00:58.149> of<00:00:58.660> course<00:00:58.870> this<00:00:59.020> is<00:00:59.140> using<00:00:59.500> a<00:00:59.649> 19

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
3 the m10 of course this is using a 19

3 the m10 of course this is using a 19
nanometer<00:01:00.910> technology<00:01:01.450> that<00:01:02.050> Toshiba

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089 
nanometer technology that Toshiba

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:05.550 
nanometer technology that Toshiba
memory<00:01:04.089> that<00:01:04.300> it's<00:01:04.479> using<00:01:04.780> keep<00:01:05.020> that<00:01:05.199> in<00:01:05.320> mind

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
memory that it's using keep that in mind

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.700 
memory that it's using keep that in mind
and<00:01:05.770> they<00:01:06.160> rate<00:01:06.460> this<00:01:06.729> at<00:01:07.000> 20<00:01:07.780> gigabytes<00:01:08.380> per

and they rate this at 20 gigabytes per

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.430 
and they rate this at 20 gigabytes per
day<00:01:09.190> for<00:01:09.729> three<00:01:10.000> years<00:01:10.390> guarantee<00:01:11.170> that's

day for three years guarantee that's

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.499 
day for three years guarantee that's
more<00:01:11.979> than<00:01:12.160> enough<00:01:12.190> so<00:01:12.910> it's<00:01:13.180> definitely

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
more than enough so it's definitely

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:15.150 
more than enough so it's definitely
gonna<00:01:13.630> last<00:01:13.869> longer<00:01:14.440> than<00:01:14.680> three<00:01:14.890> years

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
gonna last longer than three years

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.639 
gonna last longer than three years

unless you're like running a server of
some<00:01:22.300> sort<00:01:22.600> so<00:01:23.050> there<00:01:23.319> you<00:01:23.410> have<00:01:23.470> it<00:01:23.800> the<00:01:23.950> drive

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
some sort so there you have it the drive

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.260 
some sort so there you have it the drive
itself<00:01:24.550> we're<00:01:24.729> gonna<00:01:24.819> look<00:01:24.970> at<00:01:25.090> some

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
itself we're gonna look at some

00:01:28.199 --> 00:01:28.209 
benchmarks nice slim good size if you're

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:30.150 
benchmarks nice slim good size if you're
putting<00:01:28.420> it<00:01:28.599> in<00:01:28.690> a<00:01:28.750> very<00:01:28.929> thin<00:01:29.289> laptop<00:01:29.950> for

example if not if you're planning on
putting<00:01:32.110> this<00:01:32.470> in<00:01:32.649> a<00:01:32.740> desktop<00:01:33.130> no<00:01:33.789> problem<00:01:34.270> it

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
putting this in a desktop no problem it

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.339 
putting this in a desktop no problem it
comes<00:01:34.840> with<00:01:35.050> this<00:01:35.170> bracket<00:01:35.890> that<00:01:36.310> you<00:01:36.369> attach

00:01:37.339 --> 00:01:37.349 
comes with this bracket that you attach

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:39.719 
comes with this bracket that you attach
basically<00:01:38.349> the<00:01:38.470> SSD<00:01:38.860> to<00:01:39.069> with<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:39.459> screws

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
basically the SSD to with the screws

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.400 
basically the SSD to with the screws
that<00:01:39.940> it<00:01:40.030> provides<00:01:40.390> and<00:01:40.660> it's<00:01:40.780> very<00:01:40.959> easy<00:01:40.990> it's

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
that it provides and it's very easy it's

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.380 
that it provides and it's very easy it's
simple<00:01:41.979> straightforward<00:01:42.429> if<00:01:43.000> you<00:01:43.090> haven't

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
simple straightforward if you haven't

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.580 
simple straightforward if you haven't
done<00:01:43.479> that<00:01:43.539> already

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
done that already

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.589 
done that already
you<00:01:44.860> just<00:01:45.039> put<00:01:45.399> it<00:01:45.490> on<00:01:45.580> there<00:01:45.819> like<00:01:45.849> that<00:01:46.030> align

00:01:46.589 --> 00:01:46.599 
you just put it on there like that align

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:49.279 
you just put it on there like that align
the<00:01:46.780> holes<00:01:47.020> and<00:01:47.349> then<00:01:47.950> put<00:01:48.789> the<00:01:48.970> screws<00:01:49.240> in

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
the holes and then put the screws in

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:53.040 
the holes and then put the screws in
underneath<00:01:50.289> and<00:01:50.590> then<00:01:51.160> attach<00:01:51.520> it<00:01:51.550> to<00:01:51.940> the<00:01:52.119> to

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
underneath and then attach it to the to

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.350 
underneath and then attach it to the to
the<00:01:53.170> case<00:01:53.380> some<00:01:54.160> new<00:01:54.459> cases<00:01:54.729> today<00:01:54.910> you<00:01:55.209> don't

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
the case some new cases today you don't

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.999 
the case some new cases today you don't
even<00:01:55.479> need<00:01:55.660> the<00:01:55.810> back<00:01:55.959> plate<00:01:56.289> or<00:01:56.649> it<00:01:56.770> already

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
even need the back plate or it already

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.999 
even need the back plate or it already
comes<00:01:57.369> with<00:01:57.459> SSD<00:01:57.940> support<00:01:58.509> so<00:01:58.840> but<00:01:59.590> there<00:01:59.920> it

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
comes with SSD support so but there it

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.040
