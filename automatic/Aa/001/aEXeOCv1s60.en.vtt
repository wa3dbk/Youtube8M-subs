00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.709
 according to the lieutenant this is the proposal of the new study that there 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:13.610
 are back to reality finalist holland 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.610
 reputed physiotherapist 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:16.670
 and you want to know 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.900
 she went to the specific register of the residents 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.900
 my wife in the number 2 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.740
 where we do not take good care of the bottle with tyson very well 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.630
 We are working with medical-hospital care. 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.740
 a caretaker of the residence in the park lafaiete 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.280
 unbeaten long ago 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.500
 entrepreneurs 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.730
 We'll start with the museum in the country. 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.290
 I'm lighter 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.370
 he is an old man 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.440
 that the posture 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.290
 my head 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.950
 and with the increase in quota 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.460
 in this dorsal part 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.679
 and to compensate who also agrees 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:55.379
 she predicts 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.140
 in the inter milan 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.190
 menke april 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.120
 the caput verified in life 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.210
 on another front 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.210
 so let's follow 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.920
 would work in the game 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.170
 the highest jump 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.050
 I hope he 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.190
 of the Brazilian with a gari and put himself in the decade by decade 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.210
 extended until 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.540
 so those of marine science is what there is 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.790
 a team if it was a little different from our 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.790
 it's cool because the loga everywhere later 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.000
 in this phase that the weight of his body is on the shoulders that the weight of the body in 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.010
 shoulder to deny because it helps to position the cliffs in case 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.500
 has a company that did 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.940
 The weight of the cliffs also helps to relax the musculature 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.390
 in addition it immobilizes the vialonga column all posterior part of the thigh 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.040
 in the case of this movement we can see here what until April click here half 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.470
 inch if you had at the end of the exercise 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.860
 this means event 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.130
 the important concealment of the new area on the back of the leg 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.840
 which is what we need to do the same name 

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:15.769
 the question is whether this posture autarch 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.979
 in fact it strengthens paravertebrais that are 

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:22.249
 hugo is the muscle stays around our spine 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:25.399
 besides giving a greater emphasis to that in the modality 

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:29.359
 and I can not and should not be afraid to click here 

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:33.009
 in fact for those who have a hyperkyphosis is very important 

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:36.339
 to improve the positioning 

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:40.239
 Miguel, this posture here is cool because we also work with the scene. 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.049
 inside the head of the neck 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.250
 as it is to have a characteristic posture that leaves the neck internalized to 

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:48.059
 customer gets to the sea 

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:51.059
 improve the position in his head as well 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.959
 in this exercise that we will do 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.879
 as the boy appears strong the temperature stays there 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.879
 withdrawn that we will do an exercise for what 

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:11.649
 beyond the federal revenue 

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:15.749
 and to improve the positioning the falls is going on then in the first 

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:20.959
 stage the selections for the employee he takes the arms ahead in this phase 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.959
 strengthen arms 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.909
 and then a second phase he advances to be leveraged wins 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:28.739
 muscles that are relapsing 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.299
 against him also lamented the goal is to maintain the alignment of the street but also 

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:42.049
 are being afflicted by the physical therapist luciana and miguel paludo 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:43.389
 Giuliana 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.799
 What's inside your bar? 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.799
 better known as the combination chocolates 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:51.989
 victor d 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.509
 Pilates exercises have contributed a lot to the correction 

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:57.360
 of this equestrian site 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.579
 and also reducing the back pain of Juliana 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.200
 I also feel very interesting for those who are not afraid or the prison and the 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.859
 voluntary resignation 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:10.489
 for this moment to tell you what is happening so far 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.219
 bonbon and little things 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:15.139
 when cutting the barbed wire and otherwise 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:18.129
 the quest to quit completely 

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:21.129
 releasing the relative nothing and I am not usually 

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:24.150
 strengthening the posterior region 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.729
 it has a very interesting interface because we have passed away 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:29.349
 abdominal region 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:33.639
 the vertebratta elongation and also the entire course of the posterior region 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:38.819
 usually those who have pains in the lumbar region or the lumbar region 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:43.479
 is already in treatment of the river quotas well features in this region 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.309
 before reaching the goal 

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:47.539
 and for those who are in the abdominal region 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:52.289
 source cet very interesting that we act in the three points very important 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:55.289
 this paperwork 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.160
 still very interesting since each member of the 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.069
 Syndicate 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:11.069
 for the relegation an invitation was very special 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:16.509
 it is evident that yes and we do not follow our cases of virus benefit in 

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:17.610
 photo above 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.449
 the recovery is attracting more important nor does it know our work 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.240
 sure we will not accept 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.449
 note the address given to the starting team 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:29.430
 I do not know dilma 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:30.419
 7 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:32.870
 The telephone 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:33.660
