boom there's my arms so here's the the

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.150 
boom there's my arms so here's the the
pieces<00:00:23.850> that<00:00:24.119> you<00:00:24.240> actually<00:00:24.390> need<00:00:25.160> padding

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
pieces that you actually need padding

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.950 
pieces that you actually need padding
and<00:00:26.609> then<00:00:26.910> what<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.150> padding<00:00:27.510> does<00:00:27.720> you

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
and then what the padding does you

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.929 
and then what the padding does you
actually<00:00:28.320> don't<00:00:28.500> need<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.429> jump<00:00:29.699> on<00:00:29.849> the

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
actually don't need it to to jump on the

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.910 
actually don't need it to to jump on the
stuff<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.179> can<00:00:30.420> use<00:00:30.630> just<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.080> trampoline

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
stuff you can use just the trampoline

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.040 
stuff you can use just the trampoline
spring<00:00:32.279> but<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.579> padding<00:00:32.969> ensures<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.750> you

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
spring but the padding ensures that you

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.020 
spring but the padding ensures that you
take<00:00:34.230> no<00:00:34.440> fall<00:00:34.739> damage<00:00:35.219> which<00:00:35.460> believe<00:00:35.820> me<00:00:35.850> at

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
take no fall damage which believe me at

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.540 
take no fall damage which believe me at
these<00:00:36.210> Heights<00:00:36.420> if<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:37.260> if<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.890> land<00:00:38.219> on<00:00:38.430> the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
basic setup you just put the padding on

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.160 
basic setup you just put the padding on
the<00:00:44.460> outside<00:00:44.820> but<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.120> springs<00:00:45.360> in<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.899> don't

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170

the outside but the springs in you don't
actually<00:00:46.410> need<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.860> put<00:00:47.039> all<00:00:47.219> four<00:00:47.520> in<00:00:47.610> there

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
you could just put like a single spring

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.740 
you could just put like a single spring
and<00:00:49.590> boom<00:00:49.980> whoa<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:50.820> have<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.180> set<00:00:51.390> pretty<00:00:51.629> high

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
and boom whoa I have it set pretty high

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.930 
and boom whoa I have it set pretty high

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
destroy it so in order to actually

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.639 
destroy it so in order to actually
activate<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.480> once<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.719> have<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.930> mod<00:00:58.140> loaded

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
activate it once you have the mod loaded

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.130 
activate it once you have the mod loaded
all<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.579> do<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.820> right-click<00:01:00.059> on<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.809> then

all you do is right-click on it and then
there's<00:01:01.350> low<00:01:01.620> medium<00:01:02.489> high<00:01:03.320> extreme<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.739> then

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
there's low medium high extreme and then

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.990 
there's low medium high extreme and then
crew<00:01:05.790> I'm<00:01:06.479> done<00:01:06.810> dying<00:01:07.110> for<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.619> day<00:01:07.830> so<00:01:08.700> let's

crew I'm done dying for the day so let's

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.700 
crew I'm done dying for the day so let's
try<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.240> on<00:01:09.390> low<00:01:09.689> I'll<00:01:09.900> show<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.320> low

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
try it on low I'll show you the low

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.510 
try it on low I'll show you the low
setting<00:01:10.979> first<00:01:12.320> there<00:01:13.320> we<00:01:13.409> go<00:01:13.560> there<00:01:14.189> we<00:01:14.340> go

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
setting first there we go there we go

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.249 
setting first there we go there we go
don't<00:01:15.000> turn<00:01:15.180> around<00:01:15.330> actually<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.900> little<00:01:16.080> bit

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
don't turn around actually a little bit

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.289 
don't turn around actually a little bit
here<00:01:16.500> whoa<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.280> don't<00:01:17.670> know<00:01:17.729> what<00:01:18.000> does<00:01:18.210> this

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
here whoa I don't know what does this

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.820 
here whoa I don't know what does this
sometimes<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.810> like<00:01:18.930> amplifies<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.799> effect

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
sometimes it like amplifies the effect

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.030 
sometimes it like amplifies the effect
let's<00:01:20.670> see<00:01:20.790> if<00:01:20.880> we<00:01:21.000> can<00:01:21.229> do<00:01:22.229> we<00:01:23.210> there<00:01:24.210> we<00:01:24.390> go

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
let's see if we can do we there we go

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.890 
let's see if we can do we there we go
there's<00:01:26.040> some<00:01:26.220> dummy<00:01:26.430> action<00:01:28.159> so<00:01:29.159> that's<00:01:29.340> low

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
there's some dummy action so that's low

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.069 
there's some dummy action so that's low
let's<00:01:30.900> get<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.170> off<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.530> for<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.829> second<00:01:32.159> oh

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
let's get it off that for a second oh

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.569 
let's get it off that for a second oh
I'm<00:01:34.079> in<00:01:34.229> creative<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.799> won't<00:01:35.009> die<00:01:35.159> I'll<00:01:35.369> show

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
I'm in creative so I won't die I'll show

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.249 
I'm in creative so I won't die I'll show
you<00:01:35.640> how<00:01:35.820> how<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.180> die<00:01:36.390> after<00:01:36.570> here's<00:01:37.320> medium

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
you how how to die after here's medium

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.859 
you how how to die after here's medium
so<00:01:40.259> it's<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.619> bit<00:01:40.890> it's<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.400> bit<00:01:41.430> higher<00:01:41.869> let's

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
so it's a bit it's a bit higher let's

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:43.969 
so it's a bit it's a bit higher let's
get<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.140> other<00:01:43.259> view<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:43.680> can<00:01:43.770> get

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
get the other view so you can get

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.330 
get the other view so you can get
perspective<00:01:44.280> oh<00:01:44.670> there<00:01:45.509> we<00:01:45.659> go

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
perspective oh there we go
