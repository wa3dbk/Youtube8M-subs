it<00:00:19.050> that<00:00:19.199> much<00:00:19.320> but<00:00:20.359> as<00:00:21.359> far<00:00:21.570> as<00:00:21.630> like<00:00:21.869> guns<00:00:22.109> go

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
it that much but as far as like guns go

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.170 
it that much but as far as like guns go

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
mk14 there those are the two best ones

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.859 
mk14 there those are the two best ones

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
the gameplay this is kind of a trap I

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.030

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
statue alpha more like up top I kind of

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.760 
statue alpha more like up top I kind of
ran<00:00:42.540> down<00:00:42.750> there<00:00:42.960> whatever<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.350> wasn't<00:00:43.649> really

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
ran down there whatever I wasn't really

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.529 
ran down there whatever I wasn't really
like<00:00:43.950> trying<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.730> trap<00:00:44.969> or<00:00:45.149> anything<00:00:45.450> that's

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
like trying to trap or anything that's

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.540

just<00:02:59.160> got<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.400> be<00:02:59.490> game<00:02:59.700> audio<00:03:00.030> or<00:03:00.300> i<00:03:00.330> might

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
just got to be game audio or i might

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.020 
just got to be game audio or i might
talk<00:03:00.810> over<00:03:01.140> it<00:03:01.230> but<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:02.430> thing<00:03:02.580> about<00:03:02.610> career

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
talk over it but the thing about career

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.890 
talk over it but the thing about career
and<00:03:03.150> it<00:03:03.210> is<00:03:03.330> there's<00:03:03.510> nothing<00:03:03.690> for<00:03:03.780> me<00:03:03.840> to

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
and it is there's nothing for me to

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.150 
and it is there's nothing for me to
really<00:03:04.050> talk<00:03:04.290> over<00:03:04.620> so<00:03:04.800> I<00:03:04.830> approached<00:03:05.130> you

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
really talk over so I approached you

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.150 
really talk over so I approached you
have<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.460> do<00:03:05.520> game<00:03:05.760> audio<00:03:06.440> but<00:03:07.440> force<00:03:07.650> killcams

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
have to do game audio but force killcams

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.270 
have to do game audio but force killcams
obviously<00:03:08.850> I'm<00:03:09.000> gonna<00:03:09.120> keep<00:03:09.330> talking<00:03:09.570> over<00:03:09.990> it

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
obviously I'm gonna keep talking over it

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.640 
obviously I'm gonna keep talking over it
I<00:03:11.280> was<00:03:12.210> gonna<00:03:12.360> try<00:03:12.630> an<00:03:12.750> episode<00:03:13.110> with<00:03:13.200> music<00:03:13.530> to

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
I was gonna try an episode with music to

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.710 
I was gonna try an episode with music to
see<00:03:13.830> how<00:03:13.920> people<00:03:13.980> liked<00:03:14.430> it<00:03:14.610> but<00:03:14.820> obviously<00:03:15.630> I

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
see how people liked it but obviously I

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.230 
see how people liked it but obviously I
can't<00:03:15.900> do<00:03:16.020> that<00:03:16.110> now<00:03:16.320> and<00:03:16.620> I<00:03:17.430> thinks<00:03:17.880> killcams

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
can't do that now and I thinks killcams

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.820 
can't do that now and I thinks killcams
is<00:03:18.360> good<00:03:18.510> for<00:03:18.660> me<00:03:18.720> to<00:03:18.840> talk<00:03:19.140> over<00:03:19.530> I<00:03:19.590> think<00:03:19.650> it

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
is good for me to talk over I think it

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.830 
is good for me to talk over I think it
makes<00:03:19.920> it<00:03:20.100> better<00:03:20.220> if<00:03:20.430> I<00:03:20.490> talk<00:03:20.700> over<00:03:20.970> it<00:03:21.060> so<00:03:21.240> I'm

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
makes it better if I talk over it so I'm

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.210 
makes it better if I talk over it so I'm
gonna<00:03:21.990> continue<00:03:22.380> to<00:03:22.440> talk<00:03:22.590> over<00:03:22.800> that<00:03:22.980> and

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
gonna continue to talk over that and

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.760 
gonna continue to talk over that and
then<00:03:23.760> I<00:03:24.209> don't<00:03:25.110> think<00:03:25.260> I<00:03:25.290> have<00:03:25.410> any<00:03:25.530> more<00:03:25.650> shows

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
then I don't think I have any more shows

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.710 
then I don't think I have any more shows
that<00:03:25.980> would<00:03:26.130> really<00:03:26.250> like<00:03:26.459> depend<00:03:26.940> on<00:03:27.090> music<00:03:27.540> I

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
that would really like depend on music I

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.410 
that would really like depend on music I
did<00:03:28.200> have<00:03:28.320> like<00:03:28.440> that<00:03:28.590> turn<00:03:28.890> up<00:03:29.100> thing<00:03:29.370> but<00:03:29.670> I'm

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
did have like that turn up thing but I'm

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.030 
did have like that turn up thing but I'm
probably<00:03:30.600> not<00:03:30.810> gonna<00:03:30.959> do<00:03:31.200> that<00:03:31.230> for<00:03:31.620> ghosts<00:03:31.860> I

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
probably not gonna do that for ghosts I

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.230 
probably not gonna do that for ghosts I
was<00:03:32.190> just<00:03:32.310> going<00:03:32.430> like<00:03:32.520> a<00:03:32.640> league<00:03:32.820> play<00:03:33.000> type

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
was just going like a league play type

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.140 
was just going like a league play type
thing<00:03:33.480> so<00:03:34.310> other<00:03:35.310> than<00:03:35.340> that<00:03:35.550> I<00:03:35.850> don't<00:03:35.880> think

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
thing so other than that I don't think

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.060 
thing so other than that I don't think
it's<00:03:36.240> gonna<00:03:36.360> affect<00:03:36.420> me<00:03:36.780> too<00:03:36.810> much<00:03:37.050> oh<00:03:37.590> and

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
it's gonna affect me too much oh and

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.680 
it's gonna affect me too much oh and
then<00:03:38.220> I<00:03:38.430> do<00:03:38.610> occasionally<00:03:39.030> put<00:03:39.360> like<00:03:39.540> these

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
then I do occasionally put like these

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.510 
then I do occasionally put like these
little<00:03:40.140> mini<00:03:40.320> colleges<00:03:40.709> montages<00:03:41.220> and<00:03:41.250> stuff

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
little mini colleges montages and stuff

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.060 
little mini colleges montages and stuff
so<00:03:41.790> I<00:03:41.970> probably<00:03:42.720> won't<00:03:42.930> do<00:03:43.440> any<00:03:43.620> more<00:03:43.770> of<00:03:43.890> those

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
so I probably won't do any more of those

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.780 
so I probably won't do any more of those
so<00:03:45.060> just<00:03:45.959> overall<00:03:46.440> anything<00:03:46.800> with<00:03:46.890> music<00:03:47.220> is

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
so just overall anything with music is

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.220 
so just overall anything with music is
out<00:03:48.120> the<00:03:48.270> window<00:03:48.300> I<00:03:48.570> can't<00:03:48.870> do<00:03:48.930> it<00:03:48.990> like<00:03:49.200> that

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
out the window I can't do it like that

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.330 
out the window I can't do it like that
so<00:03:49.500> I<00:03:49.560> don't<00:03:49.680> know<00:03:49.770> what<00:03:49.890> like<00:03:50.010> some<00:03:50.190> of<00:03:50.280> these

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
so I don't know what like some of these

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.890 
so I don't know what like some of these
channels<00:03:50.640> like<00:03:50.730> phase<00:03:50.970> and<00:03:51.180> stuff<00:03:51.360> where

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
channels like phase and stuff where

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.600 
channels like phase and stuff where
every<00:03:52.170> single<00:03:52.410> video<00:03:52.500> and<00:03:52.890> they<00:03:52.950> put<00:03:53.130> music<00:03:53.280> on

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
every single video and they put music on

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.850 
every single video and they put music on
it<00:03:53.640> so<00:03:54.000> hi<00:03:54.780> I'm<00:03:55.170> sure<00:03:55.380> they're<00:03:55.560> having<00:03:55.800> a
