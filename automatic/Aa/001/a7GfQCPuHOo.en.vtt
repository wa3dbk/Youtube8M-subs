00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.800 
to a wrong posture all right so when I
learn<00:02:15.760> something<00:02:15.940> I<00:02:16.240> always<00:02:16.330> make<00:02:16.570> sure<00:02:16.600> that

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
learn something I always make sure that

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.110 
learn something I always make sure that
I<00:02:16.870> do<00:02:17.200> it<00:02:17.230> once<00:02:17.560> but<00:02:18.310> I<00:02:18.370> try<00:02:18.610> to<00:02:18.670> make<00:02:18.970> it

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
I do it once but I try to make it

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.660 
I do it once but I try to make it
perfect<00:02:19.570> for<00:02:19.630> us<00:02:19.780> after<00:02:20.400> that

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
perfect for us after that

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.730 
perfect for us after that
from<00:02:22.300> there<00:02:22.510> I<00:02:22.540> gonna<00:02:22.750> do<00:02:22.930> it<00:02:23.050> multiple<00:02:23.200> times

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
from there I gonna do it multiple times

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.570 
from there I gonna do it multiple times
all<00:02:24.580> right<00:02:24.730> so<00:02:25.090> again<00:02:25.270> make<00:02:26.200> sure<00:02:26.230> you<00:02:26.500> do<00:02:26.680> one

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
all right so again make sure you do one

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.980 
all right so again make sure you do one
hops<00:02:27.850> and<00:02:28.120> try<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.550> get<00:02:30.550> the<00:02:31.090> comfortable<00:02:31.510> hops

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
hops and try to get the comfortable hops

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.360 
hops and try to get the comfortable hops
or<00:02:32.880> two<00:02:33.880> hops<00:02:34.120> that<00:02:34.300> you<00:02:34.660> feel<00:02:34.960> you<00:02:35.890> feel<00:02:36.160> the

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
or two hops that you feel you feel the

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.560 
or two hops that you feel you feel the
balance<00:02:36.550> from<00:02:37.390> them<00:02:37.600> oh<00:02:37.750> okay<00:02:38.820> so<00:02:39.820> let's<00:02:40.210> do<00:02:40.480> it

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
balance from them oh okay so let's do it

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:49.320 
balance from them oh okay so let's do it
one<00:02:44.550> right<00:02:45.550> now<00:02:46.450> for<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.780> first<00:02:46.990> step<00:02:48.330> you're

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
one right now for the first step you're

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.300 
one right now for the first step you're
gonna<00:02:49.450> do<00:02:49.660> multiple<00:02:50.290> hops<00:02:50.670> okay<00:02:51.930> so<00:02:53.130> I'm<00:02:54.130> going

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
gonna do multiple hops okay so I'm going

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.840 
gonna do multiple hops okay so I'm going
to<00:02:54.340> try<00:02:54.520> to<00:02:54.959> do<00:02:55.959> a<00:02:55.989> few<00:02:56.170> hops<00:02:56.380> and<00:02:57.130> let's<00:02:57.790> see

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
to try to do a few hops and let's see

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:05.530 
to try to do a few hops and let's see
how<00:02:57.910> it<00:02:57.970> goes

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.199 

all<00:03:06.540> right<00:03:06.660> so<00:03:07.260> that's<00:03:08.160> it<00:03:08.340> for<00:03:08.459> this<00:03:08.580> tutorial

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
you know it's gonna quit pest curse if

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.770 
you know it's gonna quit pest curse if
you<00:03:12.900> already<00:03:12.990> master<00:03:13.440> hand<00:03:13.680> hubs<00:03:13.970> you'd<00:03:14.970> be<00:03:15.270> so

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
you already master hand hubs you'd be so

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.110 
you already master hand hubs you'd be so
much<00:03:15.810> easier<00:03:16.050> for<00:03:16.680> you<00:03:16.800> to<00:03:17.069> learn<00:03:17.670> this<00:03:17.880> whole
