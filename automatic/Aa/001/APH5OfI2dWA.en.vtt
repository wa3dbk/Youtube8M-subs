will produce the gas wearing the oxide
which<00:01:36.390> goes<00:01:36.630> in<00:01:36.870> there<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.140> cleans<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.440> up

which goes in there and cleans it up
this<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.250> very<00:01:38.610> mild<00:01:39.030> solution<00:01:39.480> a<00:01:40.020> very<00:01:40.050> weak

this is a very mild solution a very weak
gas<00:01:40.920> but<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.730> is<00:01:41.790> very<00:01:42.150> effective<00:01:42.510> in

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
gas but it is very effective in

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
these sources so it's important to

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.420 
these sources so it's important to

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
establish any hook and keep it clean it

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.890 
establish any hook and keep it clean it
doesn't<00:01:53.550> mean<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:53.910> the<00:01:54.120> horse<00:01:54.300> can<00:01:54.540> never<00:01:54.720> go

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
doesn't mean that the horse can never go

doesn't mean that the horse can never go
