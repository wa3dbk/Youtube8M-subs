 Let's do with soap and first we 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.260
 let's also use a knife 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.860
 some people take fear and we will make a 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.689

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:31.799

 Then we'll roll up 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:52.079
 After rolling up, we'll all go 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:52.079
 fit into our soap and 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:06.370

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:21.669

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.819

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.819
 hence we will use hot glue 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:41.680
 We're going to use hot glue on this one. 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:44.099
 moment and we'll put it right here in 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.099
 tip 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:59.270
 After you paste it, it will look like this. 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.270

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:25.650
 I do not know how to do it with a drunkard. 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.860

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:51.510
 soap will be right and if you know the 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:55.260
 who is it for you to put in boxes 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:57.930
 of five senses, for example in the 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.180
 of smell you can use soaps 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.800
 because besides feeling the smell you 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.120
 You can buy a scent of preference. 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:08.100
 the person you are going to give the gift 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:14.490

 will pull the little thing will spin here from 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.590
 side 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:26.010
 You'll pull until that's the message. 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:31.200
 complete the message against this person 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:33.920
 worth when it will save the message 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:40.020
 on the page 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:43.050
 The key is usually and when you finish 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:45.030
