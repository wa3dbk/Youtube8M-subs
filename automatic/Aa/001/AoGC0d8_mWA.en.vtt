 a video in which I'm going to teach a 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.240
 application that is fantastic 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.400
 it's about zeppelin with zeppelin let's go 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.140
 to be able to put a custom logo on 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.340
 image that we want in the 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.320
 carrier of our operator 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.909
 usually top left on 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.680
 where you have to put north usually put 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.649
 the name of our operator either 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.990
 orange movistar haiti anti telcel 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.090
 operator that you 6 but I this time 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.170
 has put part of the logo of my channel and 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.090
 in this video I will also teach you 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.710
 how to create our own logos 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.509
 personalized the first thing we have 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.729
 what to do is install zeppelin for it 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:56.450
 let's open cydia let's go find 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.800
 and we are going to look for zeppelin we will enter 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.360
 zeppelin of this application is 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.250
 totally free and is in the 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.020
 Mayan mods repository and where to me 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.240
 it puts me modify to you it will leave you 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.070
 install and once installed we're going to 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.050
 go backwards you will see that in the menu of 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.820
 adjustments you are going to have a new menu 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.220
 which is the zeppelin settings menu 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.410
 we enter inside and we can activate it or 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.030
 turn it off as you see if you deactivated it to 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.130
 I get the word from north that 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.900
 had constants and if we activate it we 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.610
 appears the custom logo that I have 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.590
 created and inside you are going to have several 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.810
 options that are already default 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.940
 you can put the android logo on 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.760
 apple logo the ingrid aces logo 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.830
 autobots batman that this one is great the 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.970
 nike logo the superman logo changes 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.680
 It is one of the ones I like how 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.030
 is and well now comes the most 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.470
 interesting of all that is to create 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.840
 our own custom logos 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.849
 For this we are going to choose an image 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.920
 that we want for example I have 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.599
 chosen the custom youtube logo 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.340
 I've put on my sweatshirts and my 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.590
 shirts that is this image from here 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.180
 as you can see it is a super image 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.650
 cool that is my youtube logo with 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.330
 the old logo that I used for myself 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.430
 channel and with my personalized address 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.410
 We are going to put this same image 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.940
 in the carrier of our iphone and now 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.349
 I'm going to teach you how to do this 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.660
 have photoshop or some tool 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.849
 that allows you to modify images 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.860
 to open this image with photoshop and 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.810
 let's click on where you put file and 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.849
 let's do a new project I'm going to 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.709
 call cardiel youtube and we're going to 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.230
 put some specific measures that are going to 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.599
 be a width of 140 pixels a 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.940
 height of 28 pixels and a resolution of 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.500
 300 pixels per inch according and you 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.470
 let's put the content of the fund be 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.090
 transparent and we give it to ok and here is 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.920
 where are we going to place our image 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.400
 personalized for it first I've 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.290
 taken away 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.540
 so you do not have the white background that 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.340
 we had before and now we're going to modify 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.819
 the size of the image agree that 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.790
 let's make it smaller 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.530
 let's make it very small more or less 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.299
 I believe that this size even 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.670
 surely have to be smaller 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.799
 we're still going to take it to the project 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.480
 our carrier to see how it fits and 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.499
 well more or less is there we are going to 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.499
 make it a little smaller 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.580
 and there it is, we have already fitted it in 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.470
 measures that have to be very well then 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.150
 now comes a very important part 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.500
 we are also going to have to save this 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.090
 same image with five names 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.220
 different that I am going to tell you now for 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.500
 it as if from file and save as 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.390
 the format has to be in png the 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.440
 First name has to be this one here 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.560
 black 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.390
 2x point png and let's give it to save 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.650
 all these names or I'll leave it for 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.790
 supposedly down in the description of 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.400
 video for us to go crazy 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.230
 copying the screen or trying 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.490
 decipher what it puts down in the section 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.900
 of the video as always in the part of 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.310
 below I will leave all the details 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.720
 and the five names with which they have 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.580
 have to save these files so that 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.030
 you just have to copy and paste from 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.440
 agreement 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.270
 well once we have our 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.430
 image with the five names saved 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.260
 we can already do the photoshop we have 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.210
 here in our five files and we're going 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.460
 to create a folder to put them inside 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.160
 we are going to put a name for example 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.020
 I'm going to name it YouTube 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.490
 obviously my five files here 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.919
 inside and now we're going to have to poke 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.630
 this folder by ssh within our 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:57.040
 iphone in the zeppelin folder for 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.440
 it is logical that we are going to have to 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.790
 enter by ssh to our device 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.590
 somehow you can enter from your 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.510
 favorite way or me for example always 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.190
 use 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.480
 today I will also leave of course in 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.830
 the bottom part in the description of 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.780
 video a link so you can 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.310
 download there are cam box for both windows 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.570
 as for mac this application is 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.000
 universal for the two platforms 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.830
 then we are going to go to the bookstore and 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.740
 we're going to go to zeppelin and we're going to 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.780
 drag our folder inside here 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.780
 we already have it copied here and we can 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.389
 get out of there we go 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.130
 then now let's go to adjustments we 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:30.560
 let's go to the zeppelin settings 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.480
 here in zeppelin and we get into the 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.220
 topics and as you see here in the part of 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.230
 down we have the subject that we 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.900
 we've got what's called youtube and how 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.310
 you can see this is wonderful 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.960
 As is normal, it is an example for 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.820
 you can see that you can create any 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.680
 type of logo to put with zeppelin 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.030
 and I highly recommend that you put it 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.590
 and I'm going to leave you of course below in 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.240
 the description of the video also the two 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.800
 logos that I created so much my 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.210
 north logo like this from youtube 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.830
 so you can download them and 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.900
 put in zeppelin if you like os 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.460
 I encourage that if you create a logo that 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.169
 be cool and want to share with the 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.820
