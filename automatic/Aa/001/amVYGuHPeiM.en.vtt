you get off the interstate or the
Turnpike<00:02:24.010> I<00:02:24.190> should<00:02:24.370> say<00:02:24.550> so

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
Turnpike I should say so

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.259 
Turnpike I should say so
we're<00:02:25.690> going<00:02:26.050> for<00:02:26.440> maybe<00:02:26.920> about<00:02:27.099> sixty<00:02:28.060> miles

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
we're going for maybe about sixty miles

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.449 
we're going for maybe about sixty miles
and<00:02:28.720> and<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.140> way<00:02:29.290> I<00:02:29.319> can<00:02:29.620> see<00:02:29.890> it<00:02:29.980> is<00:02:30.099> it<00:02:30.220> cost

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
and and the way I can see it is it cost

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.300 
and and the way I can see it is it cost
anywhere<00:02:30.910> from<00:02:30.970> about<00:02:31.959> five<00:02:32.620> dollars<00:02:33.160> to

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
anywhere from about five dollars to

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.400 
anywhere from about five dollars to
about<00:02:33.400> eight<00:02:33.819> dollars<00:02:34.120> for<00:02:34.390> that<00:02:34.750> sixty<00:02:35.200> miles

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
about eight dollars for that sixty miles

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.520 
about eight dollars for that sixty miles
in<00:02:35.769> tolls<00:02:36.069> that<00:02:36.489> seems<00:02:37.420> a<00:02:37.510> bit<00:02:37.540> ridiculous<00:02:38.349> but

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
in tolls that seems a bit ridiculous but

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:39.900 
in tolls that seems a bit ridiculous but
we'll<00:02:38.920> see<00:02:39.099> what<00:02:39.280> it<00:02:39.370> is<00:02:39.459> when<00:02:39.700> we're<00:02:39.819> getting

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
license plate that goes through there

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.400 
license plate that goes through there
and<00:04:19.070> then<00:04:20.070> I<00:04:20.280> guess<00:04:20.699> from<00:04:21.479> what<00:04:21.570> I<00:04:21.720> gathered

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
and then I guess from what I gathered

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.800 
and then I guess from what I gathered
you<00:04:22.620> get<00:04:22.979> your<00:04:23.659> charges<00:04:24.659> in<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.199> mail<00:04:25.409> and

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
you get your charges in the mail and

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.180 
you get your charges in the mail and
apparently<00:04:27.810> it<00:04:28.050> seems<00:04:28.349> that<00:04:28.560> it<00:04:28.740> does<00:04:28.949> make

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
apparently it seems that it does make

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.860 
apparently it seems that it does make
mistakes<00:04:29.430> even<00:04:30.030> if<00:04:30.090> the<00:04:30.240> license<00:04:30.630> plate<00:04:30.840> is

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
mistakes even if the license plate is

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.430 
mistakes even if the license plate is
dirty<00:04:31.409> or<00:04:31.889> or<00:04:32.490> not<00:04:32.849> that<00:04:33.120> visible<00:04:33.419> or<00:04:33.840> whatever

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
dirty or or not that visible or whatever

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.750 
dirty or or not that visible or whatever
it<00:04:34.740> has<00:04:34.949> made<00:04:35.250> a<00:04:35.280> mistake<00:04:35.789> and<00:04:37.520> it's<00:04:38.520> something

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
it has made a mistake and it's something

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.960 
it has made a mistake and it's something
that<00:04:38.909> should<00:04:39.030> be<00:04:39.180> watched<00:04:39.539> for<00:04:40.729> but<00:04:41.729> the<00:04:41.849> other

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
that should be watched for but the other

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.760 
that should be watched for but the other
thing<00:04:42.150> that<00:04:42.180> I<00:04:42.300> was<00:04:42.510> wondering<00:04:42.720> about<00:04:43.050> if<00:04:43.470> this

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
thing that I was wondering about if this

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.760 
thing that I was wondering about if this
is<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:44.130> case<00:04:44.310> that<00:04:44.370> the<00:04:45.320> payments<00:04:46.320> happen

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
is the case that the payments happen

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.200 
is the case that the payments happen
because<00:04:46.949> you<00:04:47.220> get<00:04:47.370> them<00:04:47.460> in<00:04:47.580> the<00:04:47.669> mail<00:04:47.820> first

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
because you get them in the mail first

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.370 
because you get them in the mail first
of<00:04:48.330> all<00:04:48.389> that's<00:04:48.539> gonna<00:04:48.750> be<00:04:48.960> about<00:04:49.169> as

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
of all that's gonna be about as

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.550 
of all that's gonna be about as
inefficient<00:04:50.010> as<00:04:50.750> you<00:04:51.750> can<00:04:51.900> imagine<00:04:52.020> I<00:04:52.530> mean

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
inefficient as you can imagine I mean

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.320 
inefficient as you can imagine I mean
it's<00:04:52.830> a<00:04:52.889> bureaucratic<00:04:53.159> nightmare<00:04:53.820> of<00:04:54.270> you

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
it's a bureaucratic nightmare of you

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.000 
it's a bureaucratic nightmare of you
know<00:04:54.449> having<00:04:54.659> to<00:04:54.840> all<00:04:54.930> the<00:04:55.139> photographs<00:04:55.470> you

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
know having to all the photographs you

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.740 
know having to all the photographs you
got<00:04:56.130> to<00:04:56.220> check<00:04:56.460> these<00:04:56.909> public<00:04:57.300> computers

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
got to check these public computers

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.399 
got to check these public computers
obviously<00:04:58.470> that<00:04:59.780> locate<00:05:00.780> them<00:05:01.050> and<00:05:01.080> then<00:05:01.320> you

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:01.409 
obviously that locate them and then you

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:03.740 
obviously that locate them and then you
got<00:05:01.560> to<00:05:01.680> find<00:05:01.860> out<00:05:02.099> the<00:05:02.400> registered<00:05:03.210> owners<00:05:03.570> of

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
got to find out the registered owners of

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.330 
got to find out the registered owners of
the<00:05:03.810> vehicle<00:05:04.289> incident<00:05:04.740> to<00:05:04.830> the<00:05:04.919> vehicle

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
the vehicle incident to the vehicle

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.000 
the vehicle incident to the vehicle
owners<00:05:05.699> I<00:05:05.940> don't<00:05:06.930> know<00:05:07.139> how<00:05:07.380> that<00:05:07.440> would<00:05:07.770> work

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
owners I don't know how that would work

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.580

here from California or Florida or
Saskatchewan<00:05:52.810> Ontario<00:05:53.550> they're<00:05:54.550> gonna<00:05:54.640> be

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
Saskatchewan Ontario they're gonna be

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.970 
Saskatchewan Ontario they're gonna be
sending<00:05:55.060> the<00:05:55.360> tickets<00:05:55.780> to<00:05:55.960> Ontario<00:05:56.530> I<00:05:56.770> mean

sending the tickets to Ontario I mean
think<00:05:57.220> about<00:05:57.280> how<00:05:57.460> inefficient<00:05:58.180> that<00:05:58.600> is<00:05:58.810> it

00:05:59.220 --> 00:05:59.230 
think about how inefficient that is it

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.980 
think about how inefficient that is it
just<00:05:59.260> boggles<00:05:59.650> the<00:05:59.920> mind
