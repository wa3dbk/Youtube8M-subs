00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
just put it on the flat end go right to

just put it on the flat end go right to
the<00:02:45.300> router<00:02:45.480> itself<00:02:45.860> at<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:46.980> bottom<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.400> the

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.670 
but I got it connected the next thing to
do<00:03:13.260> is<00:03:14.360> to<00:03:15.860> get<00:03:16.860> my<00:03:16.920> box<00:03:17.280> mounted<00:03:17.880> up<00:03:18.000> there<00:03:18.270> in

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
the gantry so that's it

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.600 
the gantry so that's it
