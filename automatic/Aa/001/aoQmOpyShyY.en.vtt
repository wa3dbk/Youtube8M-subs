 are divided into several categories 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.939

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:32.149

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:53.280
 several files at the same time 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.700
 so I cut the video for you 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.610
 avoid waiting for the whole 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.430

 so there 99% 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:11.370
 so it's going to be over soon the flow 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:14.310
 varies a lot on tf1 for example a 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.920
 good speed compared to France 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.160
 televisions you see it's not very 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.160
 fluid 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:27.640
 so that's it's going to end 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:32.140
 so we have 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:35.740
 ouch of the downloaded file the format so 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:41.050
