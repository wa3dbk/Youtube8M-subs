00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hey people the sebastian here from apple 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.850
 about fitness and today with a 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.830
 something different video and it goes in 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.019
 this video about this time nutrition 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.910
 and I will frame you in this frame 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.740
 in my opinion top 7 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.809
 introduce a nutritional base 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.000
 in the long term, the best results 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.680
 to achieve 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.510
 I have never had it myself 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.070
 a longer period of calories 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.019
 counted or determined the same 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.960
 I've done that at all 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.269
 I am not convinced that this is usually the case 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.120
 because you're good at a certain time 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.130
 look then wants to make a diet 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.860
 and of course back in 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.120
 his old behavior patterns field and that 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.100
 whole then of course back to the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.989
 the other direction will be what we want 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.989
 not that's why I advise you on this 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.370
 put the s7 nutritional rules in it 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.079
 to give this video 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.420
 step by step in your diet 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.539
 to simply install in the long term 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.710
 Everything went well then 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.899
 stay tuned 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.750
 have fun and here we go 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.340
 nutritional number one is enough 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.680
 Drink sounds at the first moment 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.420
 But of course itself is close by 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.270
 many people underestimated 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.250
 I myself drink between four on the day 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.320
 up to six liters of water tea or 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.320
 black tea and eighth especially at 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.540
 These temperatures also that my 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.000
 Water balance always nice 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.710
 not maintain irritate 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.659
 Diet number two strokes 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.850
 Foods industrial 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.650
 processed sugar contained and 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.860
 prefers to use a becker 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.390
 muesli or fresh fruits back 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.130
 Diet number three strokes 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.100
 the empty carbohydrates from yours 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.170
 For example, nutrition is everything 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.720
 baked with wheat flour will to 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.920
 example white bread or noodles attacks 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.560
 you prefer to dream of wholemeal products 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.850
 for example wholemeal pasta 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.060
 wholegrain bread brown rice or 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.159
 potatoes nutritional basis 04 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.750
 try all the animal fat 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.229
 to delete your diet 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.509
 for example greasy meat or 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.850
 finished milk products the finished milk 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.759
 for the yogurt if then I would 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.850
 everything reduced fat so eat as possible 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:12.430
 little fat or dough on healthy fed 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.840
 sources back vegetable fats as well 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.550
 nuts olive oil or lonely 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.739
 nutritional basis only increased five more 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.180
 your protein intake and the whole 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.250
 course in a balanced 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.440
 relationship between animal and 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.510
 herbal proteins fall as 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.290
 animal protein sources are considered 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.030
 for example, lean meat as well 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.370
 pork loin go in meat or 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.690
 Of course we have turkey breast as well 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:43.480
 The milk products lean quark lean 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.069
 milk or even lean yogurt on the 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.380
 we have another plant side 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:50.400
 Of course, also gate protein sources as well 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.390
 rice beans lentils or peas 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.940
 Nutrition number six 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.950
 tried the evening coals amounts to about 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.470
 reduce or even avoid 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.420
 because carbohydrates deliver us a lot 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.519
 a lot of energy we use during the day 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.620
 especially our daily needs 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.170
 work to do in the evening that is rather 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.260
 less the fall of the night sleep and 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.269
 The superfluous calories will then 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.739
 optionally a fat reserves of 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:18.030
 stored and of course we want that 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.660
 not so in the last and seventh 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.970
 food base is you can 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.520
 between your main meals breakfast 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.730
 lunch and dinner 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.310
 each 19, for example, in the form of 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.150
 fresh fruit nuts or in the evening 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.830
 beneficial natural lean quark and 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:38.100
 and that's just what we're about 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.770
 although distributed more often but is in 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.590
 total less because their constant one 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.300
 have longer satiety and 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.700
 by the reverse, of course, too 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.650
 less calories to calculate so i hope 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.470
 very much that this video about you 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.000
 diet basis fine tried 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.130
 as I said the nutritional and then 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.500
 not at once in your diet 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.940
 then pay attention to it 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.400

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.440
 long-term use of the best 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.960
