of fiber dandelion is now over here in
this<00:03:47.440> lon<00:03:48.900> they're<00:03:49.900> short<00:03:50.320> that's<00:03:50.800> because

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
this lon they're short that's because

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.450 
this lon they're short that's because
I'm<00:03:51.370> that's<00:03:51.670> because<00:03:52.090> I<00:03:52.120> mode<00:03:52.680> alright<00:03:53.680> I<00:03:53.860> mode

I'm that's because I mode alright I mode
all<00:03:54.640> around<00:03:54.970> here<00:03:55.120> so<00:03:55.360> they're<00:03:55.510> growing<00:03:55.780> short

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
all around here so they're growing short

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.800 
all around here so they're growing short
and<00:03:56.590> the<00:03:56.680> leaves<00:03:56.920> are<00:03:57.070> short<00:03:57.340> and<00:03:57.520> it<00:03:58.360> wants<00:03:58.660> to

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
and the leaves are short and it wants to

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.170 
and the leaves are short and it wants to
grow<00:03:59.230> up<00:03:59.260> a<00:03:59.470> flower<00:03:59.710> really<00:04:00.070> quickly<00:04:00.430> and<00:04:00.610> its

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
grow up a flower really quickly and its

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.290 
grow up a flower really quickly and its
leaves<00:04:01.420> it<00:04:01.600> grows<00:04:01.780> leaves<00:04:02.790> basil<00:04:03.790> leaves<00:04:03.970> and

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
leaves it grows leaves basil leaves and

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.180 
leaves it grows leaves basil leaves and
its<00:04:05.200> base<00:04:05.470> 22<00:04:06.220> to<00:04:07.350> shield<00:04:08.350> out<00:04:08.560> other<00:04:08.740> plants

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
its base 22 to shield out other plants

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.240 
its base 22 to shield out other plants
so<00:04:09.280> they<00:04:09.310> don't<00:04:09.580> grow<00:04:09.700> around<00:04:09.880> it<00:04:10.440> ok<00:04:11.440> and<00:04:11.680> if

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
so they don't grow around it ok and if

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.130 
so they don't grow around it ok and if
the<00:04:12.400> grass<00:04:12.610> is<00:04:12.640> high<00:04:12.910> or<00:04:13.480> if<00:04:13.630> the<00:04:13.750> plants<00:04:14.080> are

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
the grass is high or if the plants are

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.289 
the grass is high or if the plants are
high<00:04:14.320> around<00:04:14.620> it<00:04:14.770> it<00:04:14.920> grows<00:04:15.130> high<00:04:15.490> and<00:04:16.000> if<00:04:16.090> it's

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
high around it it grows high and if it's

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.400 
high around it it grows high and if it's
short<00:04:16.390> it<00:04:16.840> grows<00:04:17.110> short<00:04:17.470> and<00:04:18.390> it<00:04:19.390> will<00:04:19.570> go<00:04:20.380> to

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
short it grows short and it will go to

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.440 
short it grows short and it will go to
seed<00:04:20.709> as<00:04:20.859> quickly<00:04:21.100> as<00:04:21.310> a<00:04:21.340> can<00:04:21.670> and<00:04:21.910> every

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
seed as quickly as a can and every

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.440 
seed as quickly as a can and every

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
single one of these petals is actually a

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.260 
single one of these petals is actually a
flower<00:04:26.130> that's<00:04:27.130> why<00:04:27.370> I<00:04:27.400> can<00:04:27.670> produce<00:04:27.850> this

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
flower that's why I can produce this

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.020 
flower that's why I can produce this
many<00:04:28.570> seeds<00:04:28.990> and<00:04:29.170> they<00:04:29.890> blow<00:04:30.370> away<00:04:30.550> on<00:04:30.850> the

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
many seeds and they blow away on the

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.180 
many seeds and they blow away on the

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.120 
and sodium right because that's what's
in<00:06:42.580> the<00:06:42.640> plant<00:06:43.060> so<00:06:43.390> I<00:06:43.690> must<00:06:44.680> be<00:06:44.800> getting<00:06:45.040> it

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.130 
in the plant so I must be getting it

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:49.740 
in the plant so I must be getting it
from<00:06:45.160> somewhere<00:06:45.310> um<00:06:47.400> let's<00:06:48.400> see<00:06:48.700> and<00:06:49.000> it<00:06:49.630> also

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:49.750 
from somewhere um let's see and it also

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.690 
from somewhere um let's see and it also
has<00:06:49.870> a<00:06:49.990> deep<00:06:50.320> taproot<00:06:50.590> so<00:06:51.040> it<00:06:51.160> doesn't<00:06:51.430> compete

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:51.700 
has a deep taproot so it doesn't compete

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.510 
has a deep taproot so it doesn't compete
with<00:06:51.880> the<00:06:51.970> grasses<00:06:52.420> okay<00:06:53.170> so<00:06:54.160> like<00:06:54.370> I<00:06:54.460> said

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:54.520 
with the grasses okay so like I said

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.000 
with the grasses okay so like I said
it's<00:06:54.820> like<00:06:54.910> an<00:06:55.030> herbal<00:06:55.360> earthworm<00:06:55.900> it<00:06:56.170> aerates

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.010 
it's like an herbal earthworm it aerates

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:02.000 
it's like an herbal earthworm it aerates
the<00:06:57.310> soil<00:06:57.730> and<00:06:58.200> providing<00:06:59.200> drainage<00:07:00.810> helps

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.010 
the soil and providing drainage helps

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:05.340 
the soil and providing drainage helps
overworked<00:07:03.010> soil<00:07:03.430> by<00:07:04.030> soaking<00:07:04.810> nutrients

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:05.350 
overworked soil by soaking nutrients

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:06.960 
overworked soil by soaking nutrients
that<00:07:05.410> are<00:07:05.470> watched<00:07:05.770> downward<00:07:06.460> and<00:07:06.610> bringing

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:06.970 
that are watched downward and bringing

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:08.910 
that are watched downward and bringing
towards<00:07:07.270> the<00:07:07.540> surface<00:07:07.750> we're<00:07:08.350> short<00:07:08.620> rooted

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:08.920 
towards the surface we're short rooted

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.010 
towards the surface we're short rooted
plants<00:07:09.370> can<00:07:09.550> use<00:07:09.850> them<00:07:10.120> right<00:07:10.690> so<00:07:10.900> it's

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:11.020 
plants can use them right so it's

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.560 
plants can use them right so it's
helping<00:07:11.320> the<00:07:11.440> other<00:07:11.590> plants<00:07:12.270> and<00:07:13.270> when<00:07:13.450> it
