00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.350
 how much those moments you lived with 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.759
 your car 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.350
 I believe so many above all have been 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.150
 the car to travel with friends with 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.710
 the girlfriend with the family 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.540
 now imagine being able to tell the story 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.769
 your story to someone who can 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.769
 to turn it into a movie 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.240
 welcome to the set of a focus on your 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.100
 life time a web project designed by ford 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.869
 it is not a simple spot but a way 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.730
 different to tell stories about 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.750
 motorists turning them into 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.400
 short films 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.390
 the idea intrigued us and we came 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.390
 to see how it was born 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.470
 dinho remains to accompany her to the challenge from 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.030
 a unipol car tells many stories of 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.560
 go there we all have a little car 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.870
 of the heart the sense of freedom that 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.240
 activated a moment of life alive 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.600
 the car for me was the beginning of one 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.600
 new life 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.250
 right now the troops are turning 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.570
 the images that guide users to 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.330
 web site navigation 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.940
 we interview the portal of the 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.620
 site and so we make a unique one 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.970
 subjective that has held up by all 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.880
 other cars that you can then 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.530
 enter inside we will have a fake plan 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.150
 sequence while high inside leads to 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.070
 make choices in therapy 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.110
 the location you see is one of the areas 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.300
 most representative of the Roman quarter 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.770
 of the Eur huge in terms of space and 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.770
 in some ways alienating 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.130
 the focus protagonist does not need to 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.570
 presentations this is the first series but 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.980
 here on 7 there are also the third 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.840
 generation in sedan version e 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.640
 station wagon and down there too 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.750
 the last then the restyling with 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.750
 shark-shaped front 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.810
 but the most interesting aspect of this 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.680
 project and how they were selected 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.680
 the stories 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.950
 the idea is to build the site 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:19.519
 divided into several parts or there is a first 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.519
 phase which is the practically teaser phase 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.140
 teaser takes you to the site when you 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.830
 land on the site 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.770
 the first thing you will see is precisely the 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:42.319
 the teaser and the pilot of the operation 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.270
 what we will do is select the 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.220
 stories the most interesting and 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.220
 then script it practically create 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.620
 and enrich them by creating videos 5 that 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.220
 will be inserted into this in 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.220
 this site 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.960
 we have received many answers 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.330
 that reconstruction is done on 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.890
 stories that are sent by users 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.560
 or anyway owner of the focus then 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.240
 it is a free reworking 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.150
 inspired for example if this person 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.550
 talk about a journey we will see 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.650
 how cinematographically will be the 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.610
 best way to describe the journey 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.130
 of this person 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.410
 there is also an important part of the 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.110
 a car as focus that following its own 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.260
 the lives of these people first 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:38.660
 kiss strings venture stories or two friends 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.660
 that they rediscover their part of life 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.940
 we have collected through facebook 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.010
 stories and stories of people who 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.390
 spontaneously they could what 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.430
 they wished we didn't ask 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.050
 something in particular and you are 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.240
 all proved super enthusiastic 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.500
 the stories they wrote in the comments 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.020
 arrived through the comments to 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.290
 these woods and their comments 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.540
 we have drawn some cans 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.520
 tell the guidelines to create the 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.860
 stories while in other cases we have it 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.080
 they actually came around 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.359
 2,500 comments roughly have us 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.590
 told the most salient events that 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.170
 they lived in that situation 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.210
 the website will act as a container and a 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.100
 contribute to the narration of these 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.930
 video for which the site will be covered and yes 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.110
 they will see the various stories of these 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:34.080
 people but each story will be shared again 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.650
 and shareable on social media by people 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.650
 who look at it 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.730
 I liked this project because 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.350
 reminds us that the car is not a 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.330
 simple means of transport but can 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.220
 really become part of ours 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.140
 family and if you agree with me 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.030
 write us what your memory is most 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.450
 nice fun you lived in 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.450
 machine 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.970
 we can not lose a catchphrase not 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.970
 all around
