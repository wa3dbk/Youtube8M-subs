00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
I felt that he was much more prepared

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.050 
I felt that he was much more prepared
than<00:03:09.780> I<00:03:09.900> was<00:03:10.110> for<00:03:10.290> this<00:03:10.349> fight<00:03:10.560> I<00:03:10.920> know<00:03:11.700> he<00:03:11.940> has
