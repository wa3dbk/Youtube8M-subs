building ovens our in spiral oven is not
a<00:00:14.180> kind<00:00:14.510> of<00:00:14.660> evolution<00:00:15.440> it<00:00:15.650> is<00:00:16.070> really<00:00:16.460> a

00:00:16.569 --> 00:00:16.579 
a kind of evolution it is really a

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:22.269 
a kind of evolution it is really a
revolution<00:00:20.109> you<00:00:21.109> know<00:00:21.320> how<00:00:21.529> it<00:00:21.679> is<00:00:21.710> when<00:00:22.070> you

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 
revolution you know how it is when you

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:24.519 
revolution you know how it is when you
in<00:00:22.400> my<00:00:22.550> guests<00:00:22.999> and<00:00:23.150> then<00:00:23.929> you<00:00:24.079> want<00:00:24.289> to

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
in my guests and then you want to

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.729 
in my guests and then you want to
prepare<00:00:25.460> wonderful<00:00:26.179> meal<00:00:26.419> and<00:00:26.779> then<00:00:27.079> you<00:00:27.289> put

00:00:27.729 --> 00:00:27.739 
prepare wonderful meal and then you put

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:29.829 
prepare wonderful meal and then you put
everything<00:00:27.919> in<00:00:28.310> the<00:00:28.429> oven<00:00:28.460> and<00:00:28.909> then<00:00:29.269> you<00:00:29.449> ask

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:29.839 
everything in the oven and then you ask

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:33.250 
everything in the oven and then you ask
yourself<00:00:30.230> every<00:00:30.829> five<00:00:31.699> minutes<00:00:32.230> hopefully<00:00:33.230> I

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
yourself every five minutes hopefully I

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.510 
yourself every five minutes hopefully I
have<00:00:33.500> chosen<00:00:33.710> the<00:00:33.950> right<00:00:34.040> temperature

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
have chosen the right temperature

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.400 
have chosen the right temperature
hopefully<00:00:35.030> I've<00:00:35.180> chosen<00:00:35.420> the<00:00:35.630> right<00:00:35.780> time<00:00:36.050> we

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
hopefully I've chosen the right time we

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.430 
hopefully I've chosen the right time we
learn<00:00:36.710> how<00:00:37.010> to<00:00:37.070> cook<00:00:37.490> in<00:00:37.730> that<00:00:37.910> way<00:00:38.260> but<00:00:39.260> the

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
learn how to cook in that way but the

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.650 
learn how to cook in that way but the
inspire<00:00:39.920> relevant<00:00:40.460> is<00:00:40.580> doing<00:00:40.970> that<00:00:41.150> vice

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
inspire relevant is doing that vice

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.980 
inspire relevant is doing that vice
versa<00:00:41.990> so<00:00:42.800> it<00:00:42.950> means<00:00:43.160> the<00:00:43.700> concept<00:00:44.270> we<00:00:44.480> use<00:00:44.720> is

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:44.990 
versa so it means the concept we use is

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.480 
versa so it means the concept we use is
totally<00:00:45.770> different<00:00:46.070> to<00:00:46.580> an<00:00:47.290> normal<00:00:48.290> oven<00:00:48.680> you

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:49.490 
totally different to an normal oven you

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:57.070 
totally different to an normal oven you
and<00:00:49.820> I<00:00:50.180> know<00:00:54.580> jaan<00:00:55.580> is<00:00:55.910> sensing<00:00:56.690> the<00:00:56.930> load

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:57.080 
and I know jaan is sensing the load

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.590 
and I know jaan is sensing the load
inside<00:00:57.500> it<00:00:57.860> means<00:00:58.250> that<00:00:58.400> the<00:00:58.820> oven<00:00:59.090> measures

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
inside it means that the oven measures

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.590 
inside it means that the oven measures
the<00:01:00.079> tiny<00:01:00.680> to<00:01:01.280> heat<00:01:01.460> it<00:01:01.490> up<00:01:01.730> to<00:01:02.270> a<00:01:02.300> certain

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
the tiny to heat it up to a certain

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.550 
the tiny to heat it up to a certain
temperature<00:01:02.870> and<00:01:03.430> all<00:01:04.430> the<00:01:04.699> information<00:01:05.390> and

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
temperature and all the information and

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.530 
temperature and all the information and
here<00:01:06.560> we<00:01:06.920> come<00:01:07.100> to<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:07.400> intelligent<00:01:08.240> part<00:01:08.270> of

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
here we come to the intelligent part of

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.310 
here we come to the intelligent part of
the<00:01:08.720> oven<00:01:08.930> we<00:01:09.740> sense<00:01:10.640> the<00:01:10.970> energy<00:01:11.659> consumption

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
the oven we sense the energy consumption

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.969 
the oven we sense the energy consumption
we<00:01:12.770> sense<00:01:13.100> how<00:01:13.640> much<00:01:13.940> is<00:01:14.240> the<00:01:14.540> oven<00:01:14.979> needed

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
we sense how much is the oven needed

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.240 
we sense how much is the oven needed
just<00:01:16.280> blew<00:01:16.550> get<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:17.180> food<00:01:17.390> heated<00:01:17.750> up<00:01:17.930> and

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
just blew get the food heated up and

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.880 
just blew get the food heated up and
this<00:01:19.250> information<00:01:19.640> is<00:01:20.200> enough<00:01:21.200> for<00:01:21.470> the<00:01:21.590> oven

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
this information is enough for the oven

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.760 
this information is enough for the oven
to<00:01:22.190> calculate<00:01:22.850> how<00:01:23.630> much<00:01:23.870> time<00:01:24.170> is<00:01:24.320> needed<00:01:24.350> and

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
to calculate how much time is needed and

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.080 
to calculate how much time is needed and
how<00:01:25.010> much<00:01:25.220> temperature<00:01:27.340> the<00:01:28.340> first<00:01:28.610> heat<00:01:28.880> up

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
how much temperature the first heat up

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.080 
how much temperature the first heat up
is<00:01:29.330> a<00:01:29.360> very<00:01:29.659> fast<00:01:30.110> heat-up<00:01:30.470> we<00:01:31.400> use<00:01:31.580> the<00:01:31.850> fan

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
is a very fast heat-up we use the fan

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.750 
is a very fast heat-up we use the fan
and<00:01:32.330> we<00:01:32.570> use<00:01:32.750> two<00:01:33.290> elements<00:01:33.950> just<00:01:34.310> to<00:01:34.549> make<00:01:34.580> it

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
and we use two elements just to make it

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.270 
and we use two elements just to make it
quicker<00:01:35.120> but<00:01:36.049> after<00:01:36.409> five<00:01:36.650> minutes<00:01:36.950> we

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
quicker but after five minutes we

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.320 
quicker but after five minutes we
already<00:01:38.240> show<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:39.530> end<00:01:39.680> user<00:01:39.950> how<00:01:40.820> much<00:01:41.060> time

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
already show the end user how much time

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.109 
already show the end user how much time
is<00:01:41.600> needed<00:01:41.840> roughly<00:01:42.830> and<00:01:43.010> then<00:01:43.580> there<00:01:43.970> is<00:01:44.090> a

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
is needed roughly and then there is a

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.310 
is needed roughly and then there is a
second<00:01:44.600> heat<00:01:44.810> up<00:01:44.990> very<00:01:45.170> heat<00:01:45.920> up<00:01:46.100> very<00:01:46.340> slow

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
second heat up very heat up very slow

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.460 
second heat up very heat up very slow
just<00:01:48.320> to<00:01:48.560> to<00:01:49.520> get<00:01:49.700> a<00:01:49.729> very<00:01:50.299> precise<00:01:50.900> response

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
just to to get a very precise response

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.700 
just to to get a very precise response
from<00:01:52.100> the<00:01:52.280> oven<00:01:52.430> then<00:01:53.150> the<00:01:53.960> normal<00:01:54.440> cooking

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
from the oven then the normal cooking

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.149 
from the oven then the normal cooking
process<00:01:55.310> starts<00:01:55.729> it<00:01:55.880> means<00:01:56.270> for<00:01:56.720> each

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
process starts it means for each

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.630 
process starts it means for each
category<00:01:58.159> we<00:01:59.030> have<00:01:59.180> a<00:01:59.210> specific<00:01:59.710> profile

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
category we have a specific profile

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.560 
category we have a specific profile
and<00:02:02.200> just<00:02:03.200> before<00:02:03.380> ending<00:02:04.070> before<00:02:04.430> that<00:02:05.150> the

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
and just before ending before that the

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.350 
and just before ending before that the
process<00:02:05.930> is<00:02:05.960> finished<00:02:06.380> you<00:02:06.979> get<00:02:07.190> a<00:02:07.400> signal

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
process is finished you get a signal

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.029 
process is finished you get a signal
from<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.869> oven<00:02:09.020> that<00:02:09.350> you<00:02:09.530> have<00:02:09.709> to<00:02:09.830> check

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
from the oven that you have to check

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.210 
from the oven that you have to check
your<00:02:10.190> result<00:02:10.550> and<00:02:10.759> if<00:02:11.300> you<00:02:11.660> want<00:02:11.990> to<00:02:12.260> find<00:02:13.040> your

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
your result and if you want to find your

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.150 
your result and if you want to find your
net<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:14.330> you<00:02:14.450> have<00:02:14.600> the<00:02:14.750> chance<00:02:14.990> I<00:02:15.319> think<00:02:16.010> this

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
net and you have the chance I think this

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.790 
net and you have the chance I think this
is<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.490> cleverness<00:02:17.330> of<00:02:17.420> his<00:02:17.810> own<00:02:18.050> that<00:02:18.380> it's

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
is the cleverness of his own that it's

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.730 
is the cleverness of his own that it's
it's<00:02:19.490> fully<00:02:20.030> automatically<00:02:20.810> organized<00:02:21.470> but

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
it's fully automatically organized but

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.390 
it's fully automatically organized but
you<00:02:22.190> have<00:02:22.430> always<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:23.480> chance<00:02:23.770> to<00:02:24.770> find<00:02:25.160> you

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
you have always the chance to find you

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.270 
you have always the chance to find you
for<00:02:25.910> yourself<00:02:26.360> so<00:02:26.990> it<00:02:27.140> means<00:02:27.260> that<00:02:27.590> there<00:02:28.250> are

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
for yourself so it means that there are

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.120 
for yourself so it means that there are
two<00:02:28.550> very<00:02:29.030> important<00:02:29.600> segments<00:02:30.440> in<00:02:30.590> one<00:02:30.950> is

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
two very important segments in one is

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.580 
two very important segments in one is
that<00:02:31.370> we<00:02:31.520> have<00:02:31.640> a<00:02:31.670> very<00:02:31.880> intelligent

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
that we have a very intelligent

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.140 
that we have a very intelligent
technology<00:02:33.590> and<00:02:34.010> on<00:02:34.160> on<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.520> other<00:02:34.700> side<00:02:34.910> all

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
technology and on on the other side all

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.010 
technology and on on the other side all
the<00:02:35.780> knowledge<00:02:36.050> we<00:02:36.590> gather<00:02:36.830> over<00:02:37.130> years<00:02:38.020> it's

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
the knowledge we gather over years it's

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.590 
the knowledge we gather over years it's
fully<00:02:39.410> implemented<00:02:40.070> in<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:40.340> oven<00:02:40.640> so<00:02:41.390> this<00:02:41.570> is

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
fully implemented in the oven so this is

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.560 
fully implemented in the oven so this is
a<00:02:41.959> totally<00:02:42.560> different<00:02:43.100> approach<00:02:43.250> and<00:02:43.670> totally

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
a totally different approach and totally

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.540 
a totally different approach and totally
new<00:02:44.750> technology<00:02:46.930> using<00:02:47.930> an<00:02:48.080> in<00:02:48.260> spyro<00:02:48.739> is<00:02:48.890> even

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
new technology using an in spyro is even

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.960 
new technology using an in spyro is even
creating<00:02:50.480> fun<00:02:50.800> it<00:02:51.800> is<00:02:52.130> not<00:02:52.340> just<00:02:52.370> an<00:02:52.730> illness

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
creating fun it is not just an illness

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.320 
creating fun it is not just an illness
you<00:02:53.330> know<00:02:53.360> it<00:02:53.660> it<00:02:53.900> is<00:02:54.440> really<00:02:55.130> funny<00:02:55.580> yeah<00:02:56.060> you
