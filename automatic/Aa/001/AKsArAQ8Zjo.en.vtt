 About halfway between swing and modern jazz 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.910
 There is a style to dance 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:04.579
 I think it's the most crazy in jazz 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.579
 We play mainly on the music of that style 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:11.140

 say ag 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:28.789
 Because my ears are exactly the same, I feel this is selfishly fateful when I was a kid 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.789
 It 's an item I've always been Murai 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.420
 Hey That's right

 Communicate with customers after communication with Justy's nephew members 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:42.950
 It's music that I make while taking, but sometimes that communication is 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.409
 I have a chance to go around idlely 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.939
 Very good Aburaase exits 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.939
 I can not afford it 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:02:01.520
 Well conversation when you talk you that I am, for example, or go to your friends and your drinker is the 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.439
 It's good when you can catch a ball, but it seems like you're talking all alone 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.280
 Aren't there times 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:10.069
 Later I um 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.069
 I come home and fall into self-hate, but it feels like that 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.480
 When dating other than music 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.240
 Well it is that 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.720

 That it is not bad 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.390
 Do not only is that answer that with come so full of the head by the other dark net 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:17.660
 But there is one too 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:18.710
 I'm Jazz Daimyo I changed to the main character of Jazz Daimyo Shiri Rika, and I changed the clothes and the role of women 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.340
 I want to do it 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:27.290
 The other is Shanghai Bansking This is because the protagonist is a net 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.290

 About once every two days Re 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:49.170
 As we continue while thinking well 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:54.310
 But that's why I'll play back again and again 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:58.170
 It is but is constantly thinking Kaiserslautern to say if we Well Ya quit 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.170
 I think it will be doing music after all 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:05.160
 Pas or thing nickname manner 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:08.190
 There is a complex that I have a nickname for this. 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.430
 Really that kindergarten elementary school 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.440
 From myself 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:17.920
 I have never had a nickname 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:23.500
 This surely I am not familiar 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:25.080
 It's great for you and everyone , it 's a trauma and that complex 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:30.650
 I mean 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.650
 I really want a nickname I am looking for a nickname 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.150
 Sometimes I think about it 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:39.570
 that 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:43.380
 After all, what a big blow 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:46.680
 I will finish it tomorrow when I went 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:50.660
 Probably as always 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.660
 I think to practice the planet 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.129
 You do 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:05:03.110
 Well that's right from the point of view 

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:06.740
 Also been heard refreshing head a Hey music sound in that such 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:12.320
 I'm troubled, I felt a little wry about a little later 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:16.240
 I think it 's good to have them listen. Some people just don't have that drinker. 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:20.470
 Also that I we play I think you 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:24.730
 A jazz club is basically said to have you drink that liquor slowly 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:29.790
 Nde not have become that is to increase to a system timetable 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:35.740
 If you don't have a drink, you may end up with a good 5 branch slope . 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:39.789
 But we Mucha for when such went to the seat of the audience to quite break time 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:44.949
 I will talk to you if you are bored 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:48.060
 It is not an idea that you can not go to such places unless you have the drink 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:51.820
 I think it may be good 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:55.300
 I think I'm a I want is what to say to God 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:59.370
 That god is 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.370

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:11.039
 This is a bad place to make 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:16.800
 Jazz performance is often compared to sports 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:21.820
 And audience that is customers can now have been said to be another one of the players 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:28.720
 It's an important companion who will make the game live with us 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:30.400
 By all means come to our game place, the jazz club, and advance the game together 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:34.260
 I think if you can 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.260
