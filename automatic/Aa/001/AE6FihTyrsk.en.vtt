00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:08.490
 what's up with people zero tv with one 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.219
 new video to the teenager's news 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.410
 spokesman because of the new dlc 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.900
 updater because he becomes a dealer 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.740
 act or at least one more piece 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.810
 as previously 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.039
 he becomes your materials 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.600
 exchange this when we get this 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.640
 then it's whole 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.490
 interesting that one ascendant energy 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.199
 can convert to fragments as well 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.060
 then it goes with the luminous energy 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.250
 to shatter that 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.230
 interesting is that the speaker 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.600
 better prices offers first 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.059
 then no one wants to grow 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.920
 wax short so really interesting 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.809
 besides, you can not get particles 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.360
 acquire them by old ones 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.149
 fractions a swap how cool is that 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.129
 because please now that money here and 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.930
 can exchange materials 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.960
 that was actually the job 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.760
 by elvis and others in the tower but that 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.590
 Will you do it from now on? 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.840
 You can also get updates too 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.780
 For example, other dealers in the tower 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.280
 benji will forge the weapons around 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.110
 can and not only from the railroader 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.030
 also regular weapons that you so 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.060
 Buyers can buy right 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.430
 interesting as well will be bungie weapons 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.450
 he can sell telemetry that much 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.820
 Be interesting thing of 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.259
 Usually Jaxx Watch has it every 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.790
 friday to sunday 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.799
 he will probably take over 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.630
 is there still a change in the good 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.400
 for we are falling on you then 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.500
 keep it up , that would be it 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.049
 every case now first to the speaker 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.460

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.500
