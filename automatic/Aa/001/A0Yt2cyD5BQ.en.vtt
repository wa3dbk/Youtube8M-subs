00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.040
 good gadget addicts we have new 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.420
 gadget to check the web the company 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.910
 there is no such thing as the new 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.130
 device 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.570
 the extractor and 10,000 a battery 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.529
 external to load our 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.590
 gadgets the truth is that if the power 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.300
 which indicates is correct must give us 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.560
 enough charge for several devices 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.660
 for several loads of several 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.480
 devices is a matter of 10,000 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.430
 thousand empires 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.829
 and here we see the information of 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.170
 all the connectors that it brings 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.469
 has two ports a compound with 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.460
 my exit from the empire and another one with the 25 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.440
 2000 volts 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.950
 we will we will open it for you to see 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.950
 the content 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.430
 here we have all the connectors 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.430
 adapter account 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.690
 and the battery 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.300
 it's quite heavy but the kind of 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.500
 matter that has we did not expect that 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.030
 will weigh less as you see comes here with a 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.430
 with the two lawton connectors of 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.570
 On, it has a led 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.570
 indication of battery charge 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.369
 here it will indicate us in the camera that carries 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.960
 in this case it seems to indicate that 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.960
 everything fills 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.630
 and here we have the button on the connector 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.509
 USB charging and the two connectors in 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.150
 the back part indicates the exit 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.630
 5 volts a previous 5 volts 2 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.960
 amps 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.330
 let's proceed to plug in some 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.190
 terminal a mobile to see what works 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.860
 correctly but then we will go 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.940
 expanding the network and our website 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.950
 to show you the charges that 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.320
 we get with this battery is the 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.610
 third battery that we tested with this 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.850
 We hope to have more burdens than with the 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.850
 previous 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:44.330
 the connector you do not have to people 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.330
 we need 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.040
 in this case it indicates us it is colored 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.599
 green because the mobile is already charged 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.840
 but it is not giving charge if we go here 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.470
 in 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.730
 the icon is loading us well the 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.650
 tablet we have not managed to load it 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.489
 because he connected is not the same if not 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.489
 we have an adapter 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.010
 correct to load it 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.819
 we will need an additional usb cable with 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.950
 this type of connector by our tablet 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.750
 to be able to charge it depending on the type 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.780
 of load you know that there are tablets that 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.360
 can load mind the micro sd and others 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.209
 with a connector of this type we will have 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.760
 have to verify it before being able to 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:39.030
 load it we only have to do tests 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.430
 with the kind of loaded or how much 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.989
 We will load the phone will do the 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.930
 relevant things and then we will expand the 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:48.480
 information in the review the truth is 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.870
 which is the size is correct 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.970
 charger a fairly tight size 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.790
 especially for the expensive face the face that 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.340
 have 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.689
 we only have the wing the performance that 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.209
 can give us to give the valuation 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:05.780
 good logic to finish the review of the 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:07.909
 charger if he's in 10,000 we have not 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.349
 could do the test with the tablet that 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:11.390
 we wanted to do because we do not have the 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.530
 adapter cable we have asked for one but 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.569
 it will not arrive in time to be able 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.519
 do it with checking what yes 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.509
 have done is try it with 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.789
 we will expand 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:21.620
 the entry in the review we made a 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:23.810
 loading a blackberry curve with the 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.550
 battery of 1,150 million and then we have 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.690
 proceed to load twice in two 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:32.509
 occasions the child n 003 5 for the 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.880
 Battery 3,000 Total mining remains 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:36.919
 in a line now will change then here 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.830
 appears with two but one streak remains 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:42.229
 of cargo we think it can reach 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.110
 charge at best half half load of 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:46.510
 leo 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.000
 that in principle yes that is giving what 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.920
 that offers the 10,000 empires not 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.470
 so that it arrives a little less but in 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:56.590
 this case are three thousand and two times and 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:59.260
 seventeen account of the rich ship lara 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.120
 is that of the chargers he got 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.780
 try is the best performance is 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.700
 giving with a load we can have several 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.410
 charges of a terminal even if the 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.660
 battery is less many more 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.830
 loads not two like him like I read and in 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.630
 a tablet depending on the type of 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.760
 battery can give them a charge or 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.800
 two charged defended the ability of the 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.340
 battery that incorporates the tablet and 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:23.740
 We appreciate that there is the cession of 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.600
 battery and no further we will expand the 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.440
 review on our website a greeting 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.440
