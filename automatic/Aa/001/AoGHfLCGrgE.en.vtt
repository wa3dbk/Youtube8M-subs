00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.650
 hello everyone welcome and I took 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:15.450
 crafts in this tutorial we are going to 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.450
 teach how to make this beautiful box 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.600
 as always with newspaper 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.650
 we make a good amount of these 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.230
 little tubes and so we can start you have 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.439
 We will leave the link so you can see how it 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.880
 start how cubes are made 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.530
 we started 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.570
 we take out 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.260
 we started to roll up all the blogs 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.130
 because you can 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.050
 so we will be doing a good diameter 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.990
 we want it to be our size 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.450
 from our box we already have the diameter and 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.730
 we will have to give white tail for the 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.400
 two sides and let it dry has to do the 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.040
 wall of the box we take one of the 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.150
 tubes an enamel that we are going to use 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.150
 the layer 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.020
 we have made two tubes and we have arrived 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.259
 in the end because we wanted this what 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:20.100
 we hold well and we can hold it with 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.110
 a clamp so that it does not fall apart 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.070
 then once we have a 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.020
 good number of circles we started it to 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.659
 paste on our base we give the 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.490
 first we give a little bit of silicone what 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.860
 we hold well as we do not know the number 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.020
 Exactly what will fit us in this 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.149
 circle we are not going to stick them to the base 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.149
 but we are going to hit them with each other 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.360
 well before sticking it in a circle what 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.730
 let's do first is to paint 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.530
 then we have painted the base and we have 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.830
 have to paint all the circles that we have 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.830
 fact 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.630
 we have this way 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.159
 because then you have to let it dry before 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:05.159
 to paste 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.400
 we have already stuck with each other and we see that 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.070
 it gives us a good diameter because now 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.580
 we would go hitting the base with 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.580
 watch out 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.440
 well we have finished placing 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.350
 all the circles as you see has not been 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.020
 fitted perfectly and now we're going 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:35.320
 to put these two tubes stuck together and 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:38.620
 crushed above the circles 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:41.200
 to protect then we'll start good 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.840
 we'll give you some white tail here 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.560
 to hold 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.760
 we put here a clamp 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:54.490
 and we're sticking it with the glue or with 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.550
 silicone here for all 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.630
 we hold well 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.030
 we will go putting it 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.610
 now while it dries what we have 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.230
 I actually started doing again one 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.480
 snail just like the base but in this 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.300
 occasion is going to be the stage then we have 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.950
 started we rolled everything hard that 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.950
 we can so 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:20.720
 and so we will fit tubes until 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.640
 make the diameter of our box good 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.670
 we have already done our circumference 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.410
 that would be the cover we have already painted and 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.240
 now let's wait a bit to be 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.030
 dry and we will put the decoration for 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.610
 decorate the lid let's pick up the rolls 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:38.510
 of toilet paper once finished and 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:41.360
 with a ruler we mark a centimeter of 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.260
 wide on one side 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.260
 and on the other 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.250
 and we cut 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.250
 for this 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:56.519
 so this would be what the 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:59.269
 petals of our good flower we already have 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:02.400
 here our stage we have put another 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.719
 little circle of the same thing that leads 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.340
 on the walls we have put a 

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:07.739
 marble because on the walls it also 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.409
 let's put a marble in this hole 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.930
 and then this is what we have cut out of 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:15.560
 roll of toilet paper I would paste it 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:19.440
 shown with silicone and we would paint it 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.930
 then we would do it 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.010
 and so it would be now we teach you with 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.010
 all the complete work
