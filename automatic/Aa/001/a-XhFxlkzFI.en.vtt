going to be doing is we're going to be
removing<00:00:12.410> the<00:00:13.410> brake<00:00:13.860> fluid<00:00:14.309> in<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.790> clutch

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
removing the brake fluid in the clutch

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.660 
removing the brake fluid in the clutch
reservoir<00:00:17.480> what<00:00:18.480> happens<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.619> that<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.490> course

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
reservoir what happens is that of course

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.890 
reservoir what happens is that of course
the<00:00:21.090> brake<00:00:21.300> fluid<00:00:22.460> can<00:00:23.460> absorb<00:00:23.850> moisture<00:00:24.359> in

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
the brake fluid can absorb moisture in

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.080 
the brake fluid can absorb moisture in
over<00:00:25.650> ten<00:00:26.460> years

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
over ten years

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.080 
over ten years
there<00:00:27.359> could<00:00:28.019> be<00:00:28.050> moisture<00:00:28.710> in<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.070> fluid<00:00:29.340> now

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
there could be moisture in the fluid now

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.359 
there could be moisture in the fluid now
where<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:30.539> would<00:00:30.840> give<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.080> problems<00:00:31.679> is<00:00:31.920> in

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
where that would give you problems is in

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.010 
where that would give you problems is in
the<00:00:32.460> wintertime<00:00:32.790> when<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.360> gets<00:00:33.510> very<00:00:33.690> cold

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
the wintertime when it gets very cold

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.830 
the wintertime when it gets very cold
out<00:00:34.380> that<00:00:35.250> fluid<00:00:35.730> could<00:00:35.940> freeze<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.630> give<00:00:36.750> you

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
out that fluid could freeze and give you

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.630 
out that fluid could freeze and give you
problems<00:00:37.320> so<00:00:37.829> what<00:00:37.980> we're<00:00:38.100> going<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.250> do<00:00:38.460> is

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
problems so what we're going to do is

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.060 
problems so what we're going to do is
we're<00:00:38.790> going<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.969> remove<00:00:39.390> as<00:00:40.260> much<00:00:40.469> as<00:00:40.680> we<00:00:40.829> can

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:32.289 
the reservoir it's recorded of an inch
right<00:01:25.140> there

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.300

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
now before you take the cap off the

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.419 
now before you take the cap off the
reservoir<00:01:35.789> here<00:01:36.090> make<00:01:36.929> sure<00:01:36.960> it's<00:01:37.409> nice<00:01:38.399> and

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:38.429 
reservoir here make sure it's nice and

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:43.850 
reservoir here make sure it's nice and
cleaned<00:01:39.259> so<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.350> don't<00:01:40.530> knock<00:01:40.799> any<00:01:41.750> dirt<00:01:42.860> in

cleaned so you don't knock any dirt in

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:51.609 
cleaned so you don't knock any dirt in
there

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.280 

and<00:01:52.939> watch<00:01:53.939> out<00:01:54.150> for<00:01:54.270> this<00:01:54.360> cable<00:01:54.930> here<00:01:54.960> that

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
and watch out for this cable here that

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.880 
and watch out for this cable here that
runs<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.830> the<00:01:55.860> hood<00:01:56.750> and<00:01:57.750> then<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.049> can<00:01:58.259> take

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
runs to the hood and then you can take

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:13.059 
runs to the hood and then you can take
the<00:01:59.130> cap<00:01:59.400> right<00:01:59.670> off<00:02:11.600> now<00:02:12.600> you<00:02:12.660> need<00:02:12.989> a

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
the cap right off now you need a

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:21.020 
the cap right off now you need a
container<00:02:14.069> to<00:02:14.459> put<00:02:15.020> your<00:02:16.020> fluid<00:02:16.440> in<00:02:19.760> and<00:02:20.760> just

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
container to put your fluid in and just

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:48.080 
container to put your fluid in and just
go<00:02:21.239> right<00:02:21.480> in<00:02:21.690> there

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:03:02.520 

okay<00:02:49.090> take<00:02:49.660> a<00:02:49.690> little<00:02:49.930> bit<00:02:50.080> more<00:02:50.350> out<00:03:01.530> okay

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
okay take a little bit more out okay

about a quarter of an inch from the top

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.210 
about a quarter of an inch from the top
give<00:03:44.520> it<00:03:44.610> a<00:03:44.670> little<00:03:44.790> space<00:03:48.740> now<00:03:49.740> before<00:03:50.160> you
