00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:12.239
 Sister of understanding 

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:15.139
 Why are other things compared to hiding 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:16.760
 did. It's the second time. 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.760
 Yeah. I'm going to learn a little about tomorrow's technique. 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.409
 Our woman, 

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:24.529
 The 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.529
 It's not. 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:31.669
 Stay alive and travel 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:34.519
 I have gone up or gone, 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:35.160
 Looking back 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.960
 Now it's good to have a right-handed scoring when something is unfortunate again 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.440
 Now I have a lullaby, and I have a desire to have the same desire. 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.150
 To Japan and to 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.190
 It is a losing pattern. Komo is written by two visitors 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.229
 It's grades. 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:53.170
 It's Moscow. 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.170
 I did not find anything for anything but 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.860
 But I still have spare keys. 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.760
 So today I am going to learn to focus on hands this year. 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.289
 I'm trying to learn the law. 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:09.560
 Postal code 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.990
 It's our friends who played America, 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.649
 I have been surprised that there are more than 1,000 places still. 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.620
 It took a miracle to get the product and leave it 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.570
 I'm known for making predictions. 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.000
 Four times in a word 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 have. If the 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.490
 It's a belt. 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.540
 I'm in this private banner branch. 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.070
 In Ian 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.070
 Every time I change the code. 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.490
 You are in charge of the stock Huangpao sail. 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.490
 For example, cheat like 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.210
 Weapons Jeon Seonjun netizens 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.900
 Why is it like this? 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.900
 Who now supports once more 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:34.339
 Yushimin 

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:36.790
 Why is this so ritual when 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.360
 This is a 20-person experience. 

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:44.869
 I'm sick 

00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:59.969
 10,000 

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:07.949
 Possible 

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:21.659
 in order to forget. 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.810
 I do not listen to Taiwan at the end of Lee Jae-oh. 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.019
 Listening in the middle 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:28.279
 Overpressure .. 

00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:33.309
 There is no precedent. Therefore, 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:37.190
 ubs1754707lc for 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.939
 dr. and 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:40.939
 The thing ... 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:43.120
 In addition 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.680
 It was big. ... things 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.709
 Law Department 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.489
 Things ... next thing. I asked you to. 

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:56.250
 net-worth less, followed by Lee, 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.250
 mi5 is jes forever if sony is not 1st consecutive Anthony 

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:03.069
 Because there is economic growth in the US Now there were people 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.769
 Picton and his staff have lived on the thighs for a billion won 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.769
 And the female astronauts are highly antagonistic. 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:12.879
 He added. 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:15.409
 So now you have to get hands on the call. So now 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:16.580
 Freely 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:19.580
 I can get it. I'll make a court decision. 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.110
 Country 

00:04:37.769 --> 00:04:39.249
 5.90 lower 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:42.249
 I wonder if the sound recording of the exhibit 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.560
 Not serving 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.990
 soso 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.990
 So when I get 17 wins in trade, 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.129
 The good thing about the other women coming out is 

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:00.129
 Pretty deprived according to next discipline 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:04.409
 I saw. Therefore, 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:06.189
 Disposable 

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:07.260
 stay up horse 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.260
 I have 9 good-looking girls 

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:13.199
 Auctioned praise This strategy 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:15.629
 Yes. 

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:18.499
 I think most of the countries are growing. 

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:20.369
 like this 

00:06:20.369 --> 00:06:22.900
 When we lead our worship 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.869
 I think it can help a lot. 

00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:28.289
 And now Calypso once 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:31.539
 Let's put it back on 

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:32.749
 Remember 

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:33.289
 It comes out. 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:36.699
 It seems like ... ' 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:38.629
 dr .. 

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:40.439
 I do not have time. 

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:43.439
 Our last day, 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.759
 Be born 

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:57.849
 In order for x to be beautiful 

00:06:57.849 --> 00:06:59.969
 I do not have any. 

00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:01.409
 There is no. 

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:04.409
 Again the problem and the quick praise 

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:13.139
 Yes. 

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:17.110
 I think I can hang out. 

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.009
 Later and later 

00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:22.009
 It's also now coping with 

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:29.129
 Tomorrow's four charges 

00:07:29.129 --> 00:07:31.149
 It was a stall. 

00:07:31.149 --> 00:07:34.839
 By splitting the rhythm into intent, every day a lot of Matthias .com 

00:07:35.649 --> 00:07:37.930
 written by Korean companies 

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:40.649
 No, fast bucks 

00:07:40.649 --> 00:07:42.639
 I've seen it. 

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:43.559
 I saw it. 

00:07:43.559 --> 00:07:46.199
 This question 

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:49.189
 Hyun Young is 9-10. 

00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:50.629
 it 

00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:52.199
 Should be 

00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:55.259
 I'll finish 55 by turning it. 

00:07:55.259 --> 00:07:56.519
 Some thanks
