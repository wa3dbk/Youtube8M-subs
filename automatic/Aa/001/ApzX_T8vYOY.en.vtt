been<00:00:22.890> so<00:00:23.160> busy<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.810> actually<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:25.050> was<00:00:25.890> really

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
been so busy and actually I was really

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.679 
been so busy and actually I was really
sure<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.250> was<00:00:26.490> gonna<00:00:26.550> talk<00:00:26.820> about<00:00:26.970> video<00:00:27.449> night

sure I was gonna talk about video night
I<00:00:28.140> figured<00:00:28.320> it'd<00:00:28.740> be<00:00:28.830> really<00:00:29.039> important

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
I figured it'd be really important

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.460 
I figured it'd be really important
because<00:00:29.699> this<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.179> probably<00:00:30.929> one<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.320> best

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
because this is probably one of the best

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.510 
because this is probably one of the best
games<00:00:31.590> I'll<00:00:31.949> ever<00:00:32.130> get<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:34.370> thought<00:00:35.370> was

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
games I'll ever get so I thought was

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.680 
games I'll ever get so I thought was
really<00:00:35.579> important<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.000> pick<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.270> right<00:00:36.390> topic

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
really important to pick the right topic

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.010 
really important to pick the right topic
and<00:00:37.760> what<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.790> would<00:00:38.910> out<00:00:39.149> what<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.360> realized<00:00:39.780> was
