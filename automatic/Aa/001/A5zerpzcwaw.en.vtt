is another short version but this was

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.940 
is another short version but this was
done<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:38.430> heavier<00:01:39.180> worsted<00:01:39.960> weight<00:01:40.110> yarn<00:01:40.140> so

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
done in a heavier worsted weight yarn so

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.060 
done in a heavier worsted weight yarn so
it<00:01:41.310> came<00:01:41.790> out<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:42.000> little<00:01:42.210> bit<00:01:42.450> bigger<00:01:42.920> and<00:01:43.920> you

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
it came out a little bit bigger and you

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.039 
it came out a little bit bigger and you
could<00:01:44.280> play<00:01:44.520> around<00:01:44.610> with<00:01:45.090> your<00:01:45.240> yarns<00:01:45.810> or

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
could play around with your yarns or

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.460 
could play around with your yarns or
colors<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.490> get<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.869> you<00:01:48.869> know<00:01:48.990> endless

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
colors and get a you know endless

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.160 
colors and get a you know endless
possibilities<00:01:50.189> here<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.640> then<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.689> one<00:01:51.960> was

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
possibilities here and then this one was

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.920 
possibilities here and then this one was
done<00:01:52.439> with<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.460> edging<00:01:54.450> done<00:01:54.689> in<00:01:54.869> a

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
done with the edging done in a

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.850 
done with the edging done in a
contrasting<00:01:55.590> color<00:01:56.930> so<00:01:57.930> this<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.439> 100%

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
contrasting color so this is a 100%

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.190 
contrasting color so this is a 100%
cotton<00:01:59.399> yarn<00:01:59.790> that<00:02:00.030> we<00:02:00.119> used<00:02:00.329> on<00:02:00.509> this<00:02:00.689> one<00:02:00.930> I

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
cotton yarn that we used on this one I

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.929 
cotton yarn that we used on this one I
think<00:02:01.649> it<00:02:01.860> was<00:02:01.890> Burnett<00:02:02.310> cotton<00:02:02.729> tots

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
think it was Burnett cotton tots

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.319 
think it was Burnett cotton tots
actually<00:02:03.530> but<00:02:04.530> it's<00:02:04.710> really<00:02:05.640> nice<00:02:05.939> looking

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
actually but it's really nice looking

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.940 
actually but it's really nice looking
now<00:02:06.750> here's<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.439> longest<00:02:07.890> version<00:02:09.590> which<00:02:10.590> is

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
now here's the longest version which is

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.120 
now here's the longest version which is
the<00:02:11.250> same<00:02:11.520> yarn

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
the same yarn

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.340 
the same yarn
here<00:02:12.310> but<00:02:12.610> different<00:02:13.240> color<00:02:13.420> of<00:02:13.510> course<00:02:13.900> and

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
here but different color of course and

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.300 
here but different color of course and
this<00:02:15.010> is<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.460> long<00:02:15.670> version<00:02:16.000> right<00:02:16.360> here<00:02:17.310> so

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
this is the long version right here so

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.100 
this is the long version right here so
this<00:02:18.490> would<00:02:18.700> look<00:02:18.820> really<00:02:18.880> good<00:02:19.390> with<00:02:19.690> a<00:02:19.750> pair

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
this would look really good with a pair

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.380 
this would look really good with a pair
