Hello this is Brad Larkin and I am going
to show you how to do your DNA test

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.710
from Family Tree DNA.  
First thing to know is what to assemble.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.360
You have your kit that you received in the mail.

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.689
A pair of scissors is a nice way to open it.  Have a towel or napkin standing by.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:35.380
When you open the kit, the brown paper envelope will be your return envelope.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.180
It has padding in it so you will
want to retain that.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.500
Pull your kit out

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.040
It is going to have two or three of the swabs (or brushes).

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.760
These are what you're going to use to swab

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.690
the inside of your cheek to get your
DNA cells.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.040
It's going to have an Informed Consent release form

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.520
which is also a sign-up sheet.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.620
The release form, we will cover here shortly.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:11.260
So note that there are printed
instructions in the kit.
 [Your version may be different than the one pictured.]

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
Along with a letter from Family Tree DNA laboratory.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.960
Swabbing Section of Video

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.220
To open a swab package,

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.890
what you are going to do is take one of the swab package and identify the brush end.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.230
It has a sort of plastic bristles.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.520
The other end is a pull tab. [Your package may not have the thin line].

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.480
At the thin end without the bristles, peel back a corner like this

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.740
and open it up

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.780
Be sure that when you grab it, grab the fat section, not the push tab.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.400
Be sure to tear the paper all the way
down past the brush so that it doesn't

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.760
accidentally tear the brush head off

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.350
Open your mouth, insert the swab and
scrape the inside of your cheek with the

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.850
rough end of brush.  Again do not
scrape the gum or your teeth.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.890
Scrape your cheek.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.190
[After scrapping for the amount of time the instructions or your mentor indicate]
Open your sample container vial.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.190
Insert the brush into the vial.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.860
Be sure not to contaminate the
brush by touching to anything else.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.180
When you've got the brush head inside the vial, push the release pole like that.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.100
You should see the brush end came off into the vial.  That's what we want.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.100
Just set that [plunger pole] to the side.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.120
Screw the cap back on the vial [Firmly].

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.980
Put the vial bag in the bag to be sent back to the lab.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.460
Repeat that process for the other swabs in your kit

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.640
Again, put the brush into the vial.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.780
Then depress the plunger.  This action will cause the brush head to release into the vial.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.690
That way you get the brush head off without having to touch it.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.680
[Paperwork Section of Video]

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.370
Ok, let's do the paperwork.  First thing is
if you've got one, fill out your order form.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.670
Note at the top of the form, the Test
Kit Number from the lab.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.060
That's how your results
are going to be known at the laboratory.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.069
The Test Kit Number will be at the bottom of the bar code on your individual test vials

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.409
as well as on this label here on the bag.

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.229
It will also be on your release form 
which is your next piece of paper.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.400
On your release form in the top left, write your name.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.780
Sign your signature indicating that you are taking this test in an informed way

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.240
and that no one is holding your arm and twisting it [to obtain a sample].

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.650
[Mail Section of Video]

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.129
Now you've done all your paperwork, you have swabbed your cheek with all the swab brushes

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:29.229
and it's time to pack it up and mail it
back to the lab.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.159
First thing is we're going to fold up the consent form

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.500
put it in the plastic bag.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.580
Place our test vials inside.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.540
Fold up our Order Form, if we've got one.

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:50.040
As I close the bag,  I am going to try to squeeze the air out of the plastic bag

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.120
so that it will fold flat. Then seal the plastic bag.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.020
Put it into the brown bio-mailer envelope.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.220
Close the top.  
Remove the adhesive seal tape cover [if present].

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.580
Seal it up.  
[If shipping international also affix customs form for family history hobby kit]

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.800
Put a appropriate postage stamp on it [if one is not already present].

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.560
Then mail it off to Family Tree DNA laboratory.
