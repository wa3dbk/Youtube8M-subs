 customized provokers who 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.350
 specifically began to raise the national 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.720
 question 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.359
 people tired of migrant neighborhood 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.240

 Russia for Russians Moscow for Muscovites 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.270
 the main task of the nationalists who 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.520

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.899

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.229
 residents with visitors than to report for 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.790

 for those who are in the house who are drunk 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.079
 the thugs swept their fists 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.810
 riot once again fulfilled regulations 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.450

 vegetables base on demand of people closed 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.219
 but as soon as passions subside and and 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.300

 in turquoise sweat the news is turning 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.100
 attention to the behavior of riot police 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.380
 They did not appear immediately in Biryulyovo 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.080
 but only when the windows and doors of the merchant 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.660
 center turquoise flew stones and smoke 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.550
 checkers and fighters behaved on rare 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.450
 discreet neat compared to 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.450
 last year 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:51.100
 May events in the swamp area 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:55.630

 there is terrible sibiri lemons i hope in 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:12.220
 first that lessons were learned 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:15.580
 secondly, generally speaking, if you call something 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:18.700
 was happening in turquoise riots like 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:21.970
 now they call it by no means 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.380
 what happened on may 6 last year 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.370
 swamp area 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:31.350
 can not be called a mass of unrest 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:34.750
 here five policemen are hospitalized 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.700

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.130
 I am sure that the problem of Moscow is not at all 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.440
 migrants of the Russian capital with its 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.079
 needs cannot be done without 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.030
 cheap labor from neighboring 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:51.310
 republics in European countries 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.709
 migrant workers, too, but there is power 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.440
 inviting foreign employees to 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:04:01.360
 the job of taking care of their adaptation is not 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:04.959
 worse than about its citizens and we need 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:08.940
 teach new people to come 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:12.640
 they have other customs they would be different 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:17.410
 live but they are people like us 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.380
 and it is good that they did not come to us 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:23.840
 to help us be 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:28.740
 and we can and should live together live 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:30.900
 peacefully and for the benefit of Russia now as 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.090
 sore body and unrest in 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.820
 Biryulevo in konopopog in Pugachev 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.550
 only symptoms of a serious illness 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.310
 which can heal when society 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.710
 get real political authority 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.270
