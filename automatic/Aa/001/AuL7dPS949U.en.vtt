00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:22.650
 Hello, well, the modular source is not 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.900
 modular semi modular 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.450
 What difference does this make? 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.529
 really matters 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:34.530
 come on dollar is that source that 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.910
 you connect all their cables 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.120
 separately 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.180
 then you can use these cables by connecting 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.970
 on it connects on motherboard connects in hd books 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.660
 s and a book and video cards 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.870
 Here it goes 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.050
 so the modular source you use only the 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:56.699
 cables you need the others you 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.430
 right guard semi modulate the source 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.680
 the power cord that gives you 24 pins of the 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.649
 processor plus the power cord 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.740
 of the 24-pin motherboard 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:10.860
 Sorry you get those cars, they already 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.740
 are internment soldiers at the source 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.190
 sure then those that obviously you 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.890
 have to use them already come soldiers is the cm 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:23.310
 modular and other cables as pay 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.430
 cd room usb video card and so on 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.159
 you connect the ones you need and the 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.909
 source a non-modular that already has all 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:36.030
 internally welded on it 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.689
 source is that it is not modular what is the 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.329
 her aesthetic problem is you will have 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.460
 a somewhat greater difficulty for 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.909
 be able to organize these cars that you 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.799
 do not use you have to let it curled you 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.290
 hide inside form offices 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.140
 not break the aesthetics and of course the 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.659
 internal temperature of the cabinet also 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.880
 sometimes these cables depending 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.270
 obviously from each cabinet 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.920
 these cables harm this 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.160
 See ventilating 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.679
 it's clear that a cable stays well done 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.190
 equipment as I have done in several 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:18.329
 machines perfectly meets a 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:21.000
 non- modular source and the variation of 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:23.459
 values ​​of these sources 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.720
 is too high is too much oscillation 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:30.320
 large between modular font has not changed 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.350
 or semi- mudola nor is the source entirely 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.110
 modulate it only the most expensive sources of 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:39.170
 market sometimes you get a source 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:42.200
 with the same capacity and with price well 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.380
 more so because it is not modular and 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.650
 I particularly like is not 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:52.520
 modular to be a one less connection 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.500
 beautiful one in the least to be able to give the 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.560
 hand contact or anything like that 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:01.610
 right then in terms of the source not 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:05.030
 modularity is supposed to be more 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.670
 connections but of course this 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:11.300
 quality of caregiver 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.810
 that you have in the assembly of the equipment 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.760
 ok but no interested doubts or choose 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.660
 the ideal equipment, we 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.480
 consulting 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.140
 ok a big hug and even the 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.140
 next video
