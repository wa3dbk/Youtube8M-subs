you know like the car makers do you know

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.450 
you know like the car makers do you know
car<00:06:27.960> manufacturers<00:06:28.560> they<00:06:28.710> build<00:06:28.890> like<00:06:29.070> a<00:06:29.100> clay

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460

before<00:06:32.610> they<00:06:32.970> actually<00:06:33.180> make<00:06:33.600> it<00:06:33.780> they<00:06:33.930> do<00:06:34.230> the

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:34.470 
before they actually make it they do the

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.110 
before they actually make it they do the
similar<00:06:34.830> thing<00:06:35.010> with<00:06:35.370> their<00:06:35.520> knives<00:06:35.730> here<00:06:36.030> at

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 
similar thing with their knives here at

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.670 
similar thing with their knives here at
Mecosta<00:06:36.480> then<00:06:37.200> the<00:06:37.430> laser<00:06:38.430> cut<00:06:38.820> everything

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 
Mecosta then the laser cut everything

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.740 
Mecosta then the laser cut everything
they<00:06:40.680> machine<00:06:41.340> it<00:06:41.490> out<00:06:41.640> so<00:06:41.940> the<00:06:42.090> tolerances

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:42.750 
they machine it out so the tolerances

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.440 
they machine it out so the tolerances
are<00:06:42.930> just<00:06:43.500> absolutely<00:06:44.190> tight<00:06:44.520> and<00:06:44.760> then<00:06:45.300> if

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:45.450 
are just absolutely tight and then if

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:48.710 
are just absolutely tight and then if
they<00:06:45.570> assemble<00:06:46.050> it<00:06:46.140> by<00:06:46.290> hand<00:06:46.710> you<00:06:47.240> and<00:06:48.240> and<00:06:48.600> the

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 
they assemble it by hand you and and the

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.000 
they assemble it by hand you and and the
whole<00:06:48.870> thing<00:06:49.080> has<00:06:49.200> been<00:06:49.380> designed<00:06:49.740> with<00:06:49.860> a

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.010 
whole thing has been designed with a

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.490 
whole thing has been designed with a
traditional<00:06:50.670> you<00:06:51.480> know<00:06:51.600> with<00:06:51.750> a<00:06:51.780> nod<00:06:52.170> to
