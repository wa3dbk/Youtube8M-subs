drives<00:00:51.629> are<00:00:51.780> compatible<00:00:52.079> but<00:00:52.770> you're<00:00:52.860> going

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
drives are compatible but you're going

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.350 
drives are compatible but you're going
to<00:00:53.039> need<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.250> find<00:00:53.399> an<00:00:53.579> enclosure<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.270> will

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
to need to find an enclosure that will

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.229 
to need to find an enclosure that will
fit<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.660> smaller<00:00:54.960> drives<00:00:55.289> yeah<00:00:55.969> it<00:00:56.969> would<00:00:57.120> be

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
fit the smaller drives yeah it would be

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.610 
fit the smaller drives yeah it would be
a<00:00:57.270> good<00:00:57.480> idea<00:00:57.600> just<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.960> stick<00:00:58.350> tape<00:00:58.469> them

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
a good idea just to stick tape them

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.009 
a good idea just to stick tape them
together<00:01:00.199> they<00:01:01.199> look<00:01:01.379> good<00:01:02.570> both<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:03.960> I

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
together they look good both you and I

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.380 
together they look good both you and I
have<00:01:04.049> done<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:05.309> works<00:01:05.640> perfectly<00:01:06.180> it

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390
