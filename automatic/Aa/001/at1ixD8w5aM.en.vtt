00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 tu-tu-tu-tu I don't know what the night is why 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.640
 to begin 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.790
 hello to everyone this video is about us 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.660
 From America I had them whole 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.900
 2 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.910
 and one of them came to me even in winter 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.150
 I decided to combine this all in one video 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.490
 for you to be more interesting probably 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:25.710
 let's start that tu tour tu tu tu tu tu tu 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:28.890
 the the the the the the the the the the with hours 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.349
 I came and watch michael kors 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.750
 I probably already a year in our thought about 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.410
 what i want myself watch michael kors me 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.329
 there are only aviator glasses now I still 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.489
 obladatelnitsy chasikov itself 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.860
 michael kors is a brand but he 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.260
 pretty accessible seems to me 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.770
 if anyone wants can 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.230
 redeem 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.559
 I like this design first and he 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.039
 taken from masculine as in and classic style 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.410
 but all the same and feminine lotion in 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.480
 combination with roman numerals it all 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.640
 looks at the same time and just can 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.769
 wear it like an elegant business 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.600
 style so forest personal style that is 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.670
 model is the most that neither is universally 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.530
 that's why I stopped at it to me 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.439
 of course I liked them even more 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.780
 expensive models where there are different countries 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.299
 from the colored dial but I decided so far 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.790
 stop here on such a more strict 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.650
 more classic restrained 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.750
 anti so tell me really like that 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.240
 this clasp that when pressed only 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.790
 can unbutton strap naturally 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.670
 everywhere is written michael kors on various 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.190
 small parts I had to remove the link 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.560
 here too much they were very free and 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.130
 of course i have a wild delight i am very 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.580
 glad our mind now their happy 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.870
 combining with a different style and just 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.180
 I ordered them from the official site 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.700
 michael kors somehow I hesitate 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.979
 buy such brand things in our 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.780
 I honestly do not have stores 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.640
 absolutely no confidence 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.979
 I used the parcel site 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.259
 probably many have already heard you can 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.660
 order yourself anything that doesn't 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.060
 Comes to there in Russia and you can order 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.890
 in several online stores 45 days 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.050
 Parcels can wait for each other and then 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.180
 it is all staffed in one package 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.130
 and all this is already included in the free 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.739
 total cost on the site you have 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.660
 your personal address in the USA where everything is just 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.790
 it is packed I did not even choose 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.860
 I received all the extra packaging 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.540
 safe and sound if you choose them 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.000
 own content delivery method 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.430
 it turns out very much not even expensive 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.769
 if you cooperate with the girls and 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.110
 several packages to form one 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.299
 next we carry this cosmetics i 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.030
 also ordered from beauty site america 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:41.040
 join it probably already 1 4 when me 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.739
 order comes from there very quickly 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.930
 by the way i like the most important and 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.930
 the smallest, I found my ideal 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.810
 sharpener regret I do not see now 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.970
 this is a firm maybe this goal I do not know 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.280
 but I will definitely link if I find 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.860
 leave in infobox cool what's she 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.290
 fits now under all pencils under 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.220
 any form and most important that this one 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.100
 here's the thing 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.950
 abs wheellet if you pull out then fit 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.470
 even for mega thick pencils therefore 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.269
 I'm just my little and not happy 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.980
 Now the security forces on a pencil and we, too, 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:19.320
 than just and from and sharpener tu-tu-tu so 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.440
 what else from cosmetics and let me tell you 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.440
 I will show the base of the teeth will not but 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.870
 rather than speaking the base personally we are not particularly not 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.690
 I have no problems with skin 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.850
 no like enlarged pores and some 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.740
 roughness of the skin is therefore useful to us 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.560
 not exclusively for work and beyond 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:41.040
 here are 2 more tonal bases sisi cream about 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:46.620
 trigon now he is on my face 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:49.830
 then my color is 0 10 like enough 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:53.670
 light shade delicate light texture 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:57.270
 well absorbed hides small 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:00.900
 shortcomings deficiencies moisturizes the skin for 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.700
 dry skin would be a great option spf30 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.930
 you didn't like it for daily 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.370
 of use 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.050
 If there is any and delivery as 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.390
 let's say pigment spots 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.220
 pimples need extra use 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.040
 masking tool tone foundation 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.470
 Leblon photo raid I really wanted her 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:21.049
 try because we have a lot of good 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.049
 reviews about her and I'm in color 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:28.440
 2003 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:31.440
 kulash composition 20 is good to use it 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:35.850
 for photo shoots to be an effect 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:38.790
 matt finish but for dry skin in general 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:41.910
 I do not advise if several shows shen it 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.449
 emphasize and leaving a little pink 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.639
 for owners 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:48.159
 oily and normal and combined 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:51.400
 skin i say yes for dry basically 

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:53.770
 possible but i think you can find a better one 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.870
 alternative for every day I probably 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.449
 I chose something easier to 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.509
 let's say this is a secret guys and a little 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:04.150
 I did not forget these headphones came already 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:06.789
 probably in the fall I constantly forget about 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.490
 tell them because they are constantly in 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:11.740
 using shore Nenko and all that 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.289
 pretty high quality here with us 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:21.669
 the cover sound is awesome to you now 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:24.460
 show you hear what sound here if you take 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:26.889
 apple iphone headset and stand up 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.960
 I feel better every day I know 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:32.050
 how clogged are you there but not so much 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:35.649
 Husband I specifically check out this site 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.300
 I owe you, I think that you will be Astana 

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:39.399
 or he specializes in exactly 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.409
 hardware so if there are hung 

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:44.379
 among such technology for write what you 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:46.509
 think heard or not so sad that 

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:48.639
 girls on this probably write what 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:50.589
 watch models you prefer more 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:52.839
 thin feminine or maybe you too 

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:54.969
 like such a massive version of it 

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:55.930
 tasted cosmetics in general, waiting for everyone 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:57.909
