00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
this summer I've got a Ying ding light

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.990 
this summer I've got a Ying ding light
which<00:00:16.109> is<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.350> cheap<00:00:16.980> Chinese<00:00:17.010> copy<00:00:17.699> light

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
which is a cheap Chinese copy light

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.590 
which is a cheap Chinese copy light
basically

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
basically

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.390 
basically
this<00:00:19.500> one's<00:00:19.710> from<00:00:19.830> dealextreme<00:00:20.520> it<00:00:21.240> quotes

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
this one's from dealextreme it quotes

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.849 
this one's from dealextreme it quotes
1,200<00:00:23.400> lumen<00:00:23.670> output<00:00:24.439> it's<00:00:25.439> reasonably

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
1,200 lumen output it's reasonably

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.589 
1,200 lumen output it's reasonably
bright<00:00:26.070> this<00:00:26.279> one<00:00:26.460> but<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:26.730> have<00:00:26.880> no<00:00:27.060> idea<00:00:27.390> about

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
bright this one but I have no idea about

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.740 
bright this one but I have no idea about
the<00:00:28.109> actual<00:00:28.380> output<00:00:29.119> beam<00:00:30.119> shots<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.539> follow

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
the actual output beam shots to follow

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.280 
the actual output beam shots to follow
at<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:30.990> end<00:00:31.489> it<00:00:32.489> came<00:00:33.120> with<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.390> bit<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:33.989> damage

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
at the end it came with a bit of damage

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.940 
at the end it came with a bit of damage
there<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.340> annotation<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.469> the<00:00:37.469> front<00:00:37.770> is

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
there to the annotation and the front is

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.970 
there to the annotation and the front is
loose<00:00:38.430> here<00:00:38.930> and<00:00:39.930> there's<00:00:40.410> actually<00:00:40.649> no<00:00:40.770> I

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
loose here and there's actually no I

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.069 
loose here and there's actually no I
rings<00:00:41.309> for<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.969> optics<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.629> this<00:00:42.780> entire

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
rings for the optics of this entire

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.440 
rings for the optics of this entire
front<00:00:43.379> end<00:00:43.530> if<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.430> rained<00:00:44.700> would<00:00:45.030> take<00:00:45.239> on

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
front end if it rained would take on

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.869 
front end if it rained would take on
water<00:00:45.739> that's<00:00:46.739> all<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.640> looks<00:00:47.820> like

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
water that's all so it looks like

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.360 
water that's all so it looks like
reasonably<00:00:48.510> poor<00:00:48.780> ceiling<00:00:49.260> just<00:00:49.920> here<00:00:50.219> as

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
reasonably poor ceiling just here as

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.450 
reasonably poor ceiling just here as
well<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:52.340> it<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.550> very<00:00:53.820> compact<00:00:54.629> tiny<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.680> mean

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
well so it is a very compact tiny I mean

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.250 
well so it is a very compact tiny I mean
when<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.699> say<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.239> tiny<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.750> really<00:00:58.170> is

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
when I say this is tiny it really is

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.610 
when I say this is tiny it really is
small<00:00:58.699> head<00:00:59.699> unit<00:01:00.120> it's<00:01:00.780> just<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.320> the

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
small head unit it's just that the

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.470 
small head unit it's just that the
quality<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.280> fit<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.579> finish<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:03.210> is

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
quality and the fit and finish is is

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.530 
quality and the fit and finish is is
quite<00:01:03.899> low<00:01:04.220> but<00:01:05.220> it's<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.060> want<00:01:06.210> pounds

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
quite low but it's that you want pounds

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.350 
quite low but it's that you want pounds

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.670 
and there's the plug there comes with
the<00:01:50.310> two<00:01:50.759> eye<00:01:50.790> rings<00:01:51.180> for<00:01:52.110> roughing<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.530> around

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
the two eye rings for roughing it around

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.510

so<00:01:57.710> although<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:59.040> am<00:01:59.310> worried<00:01:59.640> about<00:01:59.700> the<00:02:00.030> the

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
so although I am worried about the the

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.969 
so although I am worried about the the
ceiling<00:02:00.780> on<00:02:00.899> this<00:02:01.049> light<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.530> taking<00:02:01.890> on

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
ceiling on this light and it taking on

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.370 
ceiling on this light and it taking on
water<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:03.390> rest<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:03.899> actually<00:02:04.170> quite

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
water the rest of it is actually quite

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.950 
water the rest of it is actually quite
nice<00:02:04.530> it's<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.430> very<00:02:05.610> tiny<00:02:05.909> compact<00:02:06.479> head<00:02:06.689> I

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
nice it's a very tiny compact head I

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.830 
nice it's a very tiny compact head I
really<00:02:07.530> do<00:02:07.740> like<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.009> color<00:02:08.220> as<00:02:08.429> well<00:02:08.840> very

really do like the color as well very
simple<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.349> use<00:02:10.530> with<00:02:10.739> three<00:02:11.039> modes

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
simple to use with three modes

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.370 
simple to use with three modes

very very poor but all in all for the

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.120 
very very poor but all in all for the

quality that's really good choice

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.599 
quality that's really good choice
because<00:03:28.470> it's<00:03:28.680> not<00:03:28.829> something<00:03:29.190> I<00:03:29.430> would

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
because it's not something I would

point out there's no shielding on these

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.259 
point out there's no shielding on these
plugs<00:03:38.880> either<00:03:39.239> so<00:03:39.480> on<00:03:39.750> a<00:03:40.049> standard<00:03:40.590> kind<00:03:40.980> of

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
off-road plug for these lights you'd see

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.120 
off-road plug for these lights you'd see
a<00:03:45.090> bit<00:03:45.930> of<00:03:45.959> shield<00:03:46.320> round<00:03:46.620> here<00:03:46.859> that<00:03:47.040> will

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
a bit of shield round here that will

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.650 
a bit of shield round here that will
just<00:03:47.310> help<00:03:47.370> stop<00:03:48.079> watering<00:03:49.079> grass<00:03:49.200> as<00:03:49.470> well
