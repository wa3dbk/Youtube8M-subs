00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.980
 Battlefield 3 is not fair and should not 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.990
 be it after all it's supposed to be 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.719
 the war the curious reality of this 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.579
 game is that there are many games that already 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.440
 they have decided before facing 

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:18.600
 teams that go with the ideas much more 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.100
 clear and much more prepared and are 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.170
 better in general or get in 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.080
 patrol and do not give him any chance 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.820
 the other to win especially from your 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.090
 stance as a player if you simply 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.309
 you get in a game without any more there are some 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.490
 high chances that you finish 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.290
 eating pp and is that really what 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.540
 You can do when I go by helicopter 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.239
 above ventilates and maybe not 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.890
 take the engineer class or if it happens 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.510
 a patrol of four players that are 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.030
 more or less good maybe even 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.370
 kill two because you are very good but 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.320
 they kill you between the two that remain and they 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.239
 they rise up among themselves and what you have done 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.130
 he has not had an accused or a deceitful 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.260
 that falls on your head or suddenly 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.110
 a tank passed by there are many 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.259
 possibilities of dying in a way that 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.600
 it feels quite unfair as if not 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:07.350
 you could have done nothing to avoid it 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.729
 or for 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.400
 do some damage to the team 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.460
 otherwise I have decided to start this new 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.890
 series of steps to become a 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.930
 authentic male in battlefield 3 with 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.780
 this statement even without so 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.159
 pessimistic because I think that this game 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.259
 you have to approach with another mentality 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.570
 with the mentality of learning with 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.060
 mentality of drawing conclusions from everything 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.950
 what happens and try not to feel 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.990
 too frustrated when things do not 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.970
 they go out as we want every time 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.979
 to kill us we have to take out the 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.960
 conclusion of why they killed us and 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.369
 if the conclusion is that there was no way 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.590
 to avoid it we have to take out the 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.810
 conclusion of why there was no way to 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.399
 avoid it you have to get up to that 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.229
 point because that's how this works 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.179
 game that's another reason why 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.130
 that I have decided to start with this 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:55.110
 series you have to learn many things in 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.580
 battlefield and you have to learn them well 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.679
 because even the weapons are 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.170
 unbalanced thing that may seem 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:03.299
 unfair and to a certain extent it is but 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.190
 that's how the game works and things 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.170
 very detailed that it's hard to see how 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.330
 for example the people are 3 when the 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.709
 you shoot still is one of the best and 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.450
 when you start moving a bit towards 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.140
 the sides suddenly loses all the 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.819
 precision 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.740
 Well, those things I think it's convenient 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.810
 have someone to go 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.600
 explaining and did not hesitate at any time 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.810
 in awarding me the title of professor 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.270
 music with many are among the 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.650
 words to try good to teach you 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.390
 how to play battlefield is what 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.180
 I want to do with the series from things 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.620
 very outside like in which games 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.840
 get in and how to use the minimap 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.720
 even how to move how to use the 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.970
 vehicles or with what people get me what 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.380
 classes use what weapons everything that is 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.910
 I can pose 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.410
 while you play in your games 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.810
 even the situations that I have raised 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.820
 in the beginning how to solve them or 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.530
 how to prepare before a game 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.570
 to solve them 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.910
 once you are involved in that 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.769
 situation so nothing this is a bit 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.720

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.269
