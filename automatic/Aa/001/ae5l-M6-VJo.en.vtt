a<00:00:38.850> fuzz<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.180> picked<00:00:39.449> up<00:00:39.540> used<00:00:39.900> and<00:00:40.260> decided<00:00:41.250> to

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
a fuzz I picked up used and decided to

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.910 
a fuzz I picked up used and decided to
give<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.489> dry<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:42.120> do<00:00:42.390> have<00:00:42.750> some<00:00:43.110> general<00:00:43.680> love

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
give a dry I do have some general love

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.310

for<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.699> super<00:00:45.030> fuzz<00:00:45.239> line<00:00:45.479> in<00:00:45.690> general<00:00:46.080> so<00:00:46.290> I

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
for the super fuzz line in general so I

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.619 
for the super fuzz line in general so I
figured<00:00:46.739> I'd<00:00:46.890> give<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.040> a<00:00:47.190> run<00:00:47.370> things<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.449> note

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
figured I'd give it a run things to note

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.680

plastic Jax has this very weird put

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.649 
plastic Jax has this very weird put
together<00:00:54.930> mechanism<00:00:55.830> of<00:00:56.299> there's<00:00:57.299> just<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.510> big

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:57.659 
together mechanism of there's just a big

00:00:57.659 --> 00:00:59.600 
together mechanism of there's just a big
rubber<00:00:57.900> band<00:00:58.229> that<00:00:58.680> holds<00:00:58.860> the<00:00:59.220> whole<00:00:59.400> thing

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
rubber band that holds the whole thing

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.060 
rubber band that holds the whole thing
in<00:00:59.729> place<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.330> bitch<00:01:01.290> about<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.620> battery

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
in place I bitch about the battery

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.799

switching<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.729> lot<00:01:02.879> on<00:01:03.030> some<00:01:03.239> pedals<00:01:03.600> but

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
switching a lot on some pedals but

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.380 
switching a lot on some pedals but
that's<00:01:04.619> not<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.799> problem<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.519> it's<00:01:05.909> pretty

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
that's not a problem on this it's pretty

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.640 
that's not a problem on this it's pretty
damn<00:01:06.600> easy<00:01:07.010> so<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.610> TZ<00:01:09.060> 2<00:01:09.360> we've<00:01:09.990> got<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.409> right

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
damn easy so the TZ 2 we've got it right

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.100 
damn easy so the TZ 2 we've got it right
here<00:01:10.680> notice<00:01:11.670> there<00:01:11.850> are<00:01:11.970> only<00:01:12.150> two<00:01:12.570> knobs<00:01:12.810> on

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
here notice there are only two knobs on

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.590 
here notice there are only two knobs on
it<00:01:13.140> we've<00:01:13.530> got<00:01:13.799> volume<00:01:14.220> which<00:01:14.940> you<00:01:15.360> should

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
it we've got volume which you should

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.389 
it we've got volume which you should
just<00:01:16.049> sit<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.619> volume<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.219> you're

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
just sit to a volume that you're

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:18.889 
just sit to a volume that you're
comfortable<00:01:17.579> with<00:01:17.850> when<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.210> turn<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.539> on<00:01:18.630> and

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
comfortable with when you turn it on and

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:22.760 
comfortable with when you turn it on and
depth<00:01:19.829> def<00:01:20.250> just<00:01:20.640> controls<00:01:21.270> how<00:01:22.140> much<00:01:22.200> fuzz

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
depth def just controls how much fuzz

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.800 
depth def just controls how much fuzz
you<00:01:23.039> get<00:01:23.219> out<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.640> now<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.240> kind<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.719> a

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
you get out of it now this is kind of a

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.800 
you get out of it now this is kind of a
high<00:01:25.049> octave<00:01:25.590> eat<00:01:25.770> glitch<00:01:26.100> fuzz<00:01:26.570> it's<00:01:27.570> not<00:01:27.780> a

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
high octave eat glitch fuzz it's not a

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.740 
high octave eat glitch fuzz it's not a
smooth<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:29.310> does<00:01:29.549> bite<00:01:29.820> quite<00:01:30.090> well<00:01:30.299> the

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
smooth it does bite quite well the

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.959 
smooth it does bite quite well the
bottom<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.200> retention<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.890> decent<00:01:32.520> but<00:01:32.789> i

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:32.969 
bottom and retention is decent but i

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:35.029 
bottom and retention is decent but i
would<00:01:33.299> definitely<00:01:33.750> throw<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.320> more<00:01:34.560> into<00:01:34.890> the

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
would definitely throw it more into the

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.630 
would definitely throw it more into the
lead<00:01:35.310> line<00:01:35.520> fuzz<00:01:36.000> then<00:01:36.950> not<00:01:37.950> you're<00:01:38.369> not<00:01:38.490> going

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
lead line fuzz then not you're not going

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.560 
lead line fuzz then not you're not going
to<00:01:38.700> hold<00:01:38.789> down<00:01:38.969> the<00:01:39.119> bottom<00:01:39.450> and

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
to hold down the bottom and

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.630 
to hold down the bottom and
significantly<00:01:40.170> with<00:01:40.289> this<00:01:40.469> but<00:01:41.009> i<00:01:41.219> got<00:01:41.490> this

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
significantly with this but i got this

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.679 
significantly with this but i got this
one<00:01:41.820> used<00:01:42.090> for<00:01:42.649> $45<00:01:43.649> i<00:01:43.859> think<00:01:44.369> they're<00:01:44.549> like<00:01:44.850> 70

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
one used for $45 i think they're like 70

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.499 
one used for $45 i think they're like 70
or<00:01:45.869> 65<00:01:46.380> brand<00:01:46.799> new<00:01:47.009> so<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.030> on<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
or 65 brand new so it is on the

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.020 
or 65 brand new so it is on the
extremely<00:01:49.020> cheap<00:01:49.439> side<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.789> something

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
extremely cheap side and it is something

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.050 
extremely cheap side and it is something
fun<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.509> play<00:01:51.689> with<00:01:51.840> so<00:01:52.289> as<00:01:53.189> soon<00:01:53.369> as<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.640> can<00:01:53.850> get
