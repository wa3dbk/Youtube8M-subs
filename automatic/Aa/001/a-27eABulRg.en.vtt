recent history you see it wasn't because
of<00:00:16.010> the<00:00:16.519> axial<00:00:16.999> boxing<00:00:17.449> skills<00:00:17.749> that<00:00:18.019> they

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
of the axial boxing skills that they

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.870

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:22.339 
of their sheer brutality is because the

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:25.569 
of their sheer brutality is because the

another<00:04:37.520> guy<00:04:37.700> was<00:04:38.270> provoking<00:04:38.830> the<00:04:39.830> only

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
another guy was provoking the only

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.120 
another guy was provoking the only
problem<00:04:40.190> is<00:04:40.460> I<00:04:40.700> think<00:04:41.030> Tyson<00:04:41.450> Fury<00:04:41.950> will<00:04:42.950> get

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
problem is I think Tyson Fury will get

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.010 
problem is I think Tyson Fury will get
drawn<00:04:43.580> into<00:04:43.820> the<00:04:43.970> wrong<00:04:44.120> type<00:04:44.390> of<00:04:44.420> fight<00:04:44.750> there

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
drawn into the wrong type of fight there

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.110 
drawn into the wrong type of fight there
and<00:04:45.230> I<00:04:45.350> think<00:04:45.620> he<00:04:45.770> could<00:04:46.010> get<00:04:46.190> beat<00:04:46.430> don't

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
and I think he could get beat don't

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.430 
and I think he could get beat don't
think<00:04:47.270> he'd<00:04:47.360> be<00:04:47.450> stopped<00:04:47.750> but<00:04:47.930> I<00:04:47.990> think<00:04:48.230> we

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
think he'd be stopped but I think we

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.060 
think he'd be stopped but I think we
beat<00:04:49.310> heavily<00:04:50.090> on<00:04:50.330> point<00:04:50.630> and<00:04:51.020> last<00:04:51.800> but<00:04:51.860> not

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
beat heavily on point and last but not

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.580 
beat heavily on point and last but not
least<00:04:52.130> the<00:04:52.520> Klitschko<00:04:52.970> brothers<00:04:53.590> unfortunate

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
least the Klitschko brothers unfortunate

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.550 
least the Klitschko brothers unfortunate
thing<00:04:54.710> that<00:04:54.860> would<00:04:55.010> be<00:04:55.130> an<00:04:55.220> awful<00:04:55.880> fight

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
thing that would be an awful fight

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.680 
thing that would be an awful fight
because<00:04:57.560> I<00:04:57.590> don't<00:04:57.980> think<00:04:58.010> Tyson<00:04:58.310> would<00:04:58.970> last

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
because I don't think Tyson would last

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.410 
because I don't think Tyson would last
at<00:05:00.500> all<00:05:00.800> four<00:05:01.490> or<00:05:01.580> five<00:05:01.760> rounds<00:05:02.210> at<00:05:02.300> this

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:02.420 
at all four or five rounds at this

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.850 
at all four or five rounds at this
minute<00:05:02.720> he's<00:05:03.200> got<00:05:03.380> no<00:05:03.410> defense<00:05:04.450> en<00:05:05.860> bothame

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
minute he's got no defense en bothame

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.830 
minute he's got no defense en bothame
and<00:05:07.070> Vitaly<00:05:07.370> wouldn't<00:05:07.790> allow<00:05:08.060> him<00:05:08.240> to<00:05:08.450> get<00:05:08.660> on

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
and Vitaly wouldn't allow him to get on

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.930 
and Vitaly wouldn't allow him to get on
the<00:05:09.080> inside<00:05:09.440> where<00:05:09.740> he<00:05:09.860> does<00:05:10.010> his<00:05:10.040> good<00:05:10.370> work<00:05:10.580> I

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
the inside where he does his good work I

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.760 
the inside where he does his good work I
think<00:05:11.600> his<00:05:11.720> best<00:05:11.930> chance<00:05:12.020> for<00:05:12.350> a<00:05:12.500> world<00:05:12.620> title

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
think his best chance for a world title

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.010 
think his best chance for a world title
through<00:05:13.400> provoking<00:05:14.000> I<00:05:14.150> don't<00:05:14.420> think<00:05:14.660> he's<00:05:14.840> got

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
through provoking I don't think he's got

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.630 
through provoking I don't think he's got
a<00:05:15.080> chance<00:05:15.170> against<00:05:15.740> the<00:05:15.890> push<00:05:16.070> girls<00:05:16.310> in<00:05:16.460> any
