uninspired as its name Department

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.150 
uninspired as its name Department
evidently<00:01:42.050> was<00:01:42.350> throughout<00:01:42.740> the<00:01:42.890> entire

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
evidently was throughout the entire

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.850 
evidently was throughout the entire
project<00:01:43.490> but<00:01:44.090> surprisingly<00:01:44.690> there<00:01:45.500> is<00:01:45.530> some

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
project but surprisingly there is some

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.550 
project but surprisingly there is some
cool<00:01:46.070> stuff<00:01:46.340> here<00:01:46.520> not<00:01:46.880> the<00:01:47.000> least<00:01:47.210> of<00:01:47.420> which

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
cool stuff here not the least of which

00:01:47.560 --> 00:02:03.260 
cool stuff here not the least of which
David<00:01:48.560> Bowie<00:01:48.740> from<00:01:49.070> labyrinth

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.060 

so<00:02:04.270> the<00:02:04.360> first<00:02:04.600> cool<00:02:04.900> thing<00:02:05.170> is<00:02:05.350> that<00:02:05.380> it's

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
so the first cool thing is that it's

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.040 
so the first cool thing is that it's
kind<00:02:06.280> of<00:02:06.370> set<00:02:06.550> up<00:02:06.670> like<00:02:06.820> Mega<00:02:07.060> Man<00:02:07.300> you<00:02:07.720> have<00:02:07.870> to

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
kind of set up like Mega Man you have to

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.320 
kind of set up like Mega Man you have to
plays<00:02:08.259> Joe<00:02:08.649> because<00:02:09.100> honestly<00:02:09.759> who<00:02:09.970> else<00:02:10.149> is

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
plays Joe because honestly who else is

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.570 
plays Joe because honestly who else is
there<00:02:10.360> but<00:02:10.780> Joe<00:02:11.290> you<00:02:11.560> actually<00:02:12.280> get<00:02:12.430> to<00:02:12.550> choose

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
there but Joe you actually get to choose

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.370 
there but Joe you actually get to choose
your<00:02:12.820> opponents<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.810> path<00:02:14.020> you<00:02:14.200> take

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
your opponents and the path you take

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.990 
your opponents and the path you take
through<00:02:14.710> them<00:02:14.890> so<00:02:15.280> if<00:02:15.370> one<00:02:15.490> of<00:02:15.610> them<00:02:15.700> is<00:02:15.760> giving

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
through them so if one of them is giving

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.850 
through them so if one of them is giving
you<00:02:16.090> trouble<00:02:16.270> you<00:02:16.960> just<00:02:16.990> choose<00:02:17.410> someone<00:02:17.710> else

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
you trouble you just choose someone else

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.470 
you trouble you just choose someone else
to<00:02:18.100> go<00:02:18.220> back<00:02:18.370> to<00:02:18.490> them<00:02:18.640> later<00:02:18.850> which<00:02:19.360> is

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
to go back to them later which is

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.270 
to go back to them later which is
actually<00:02:19.840> effective<00:02:20.380> because<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:21.130> other

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
actually effective because the other

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.890 
actually effective because the other
interesting<00:02:21.850> thing<00:02:22.030> about<00:02:22.060> deadly<00:02:22.690> moves

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
interesting thing about deadly moves

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.500 
interesting thing about deadly moves
after<00:02:23.650> each<00:02:23.800> fight<00:02:24.130> Joe<00:02:24.790> automatically

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
after each fight Joe automatically

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.630 
after each fight Joe automatically

terms<00:02:50.110> of<00:02:50.260> how<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:50.410> game<00:02:50.620> plays<00:02:50.860> it's<00:02:51.250> just

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
terms of how the game plays it's just

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.150 
terms of how the game plays it's just
it's<00:02:52.240> a<00:02:52.330> pretty<00:02:52.540> standard<00:02:52.900> fighter<00:02:53.410> I<00:02:53.709> guess

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
it's a pretty standard fighter I guess

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.470 
it's a pretty standard fighter I guess
the<00:02:54.280> one<00:02:54.370> thing<00:02:54.580> that<00:02:54.730> does<00:02:54.910> set<00:02:55.150> it<00:02:55.240> apart

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
the one thing that does set it apart

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.060 
the one thing that does set it apart
from<00:02:55.570> street<00:02:55.959> fighter<00:02:55.990> is<00:02:56.350> that<00:02:56.560> it<00:02:56.950> was

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
from street fighter is that it was

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.710 
from street fighter is that it was
actually<00:02:57.220> some<00:02:57.580> depth<00:02:57.820> to<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:58.180> playing<00:02:58.420> field

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
actually some depth to the playing field

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.480 
actually some depth to the playing field
so<00:02:59.020> you<00:02:59.080> have<00:02:59.170> multiple<00:02:59.620> planes<00:02:59.920> to<00:03:00.130> work<00:03:00.250> with

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
so you have multiple planes to work with

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.670 
so you have multiple planes to work with
and<00:03:00.970> I<00:03:01.030> mean<00:03:01.180> I<00:03:01.360> guess<00:03:02.230> that's<00:03:02.470> something

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
and I mean I guess that's something

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.440 
and I mean I guess that's something
otherwise<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:03.640> game<00:03:03.760> is<00:03:03.820> kind<00:03:03.970> of<00:03:04.090> a<00:03:04.180> plane

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
otherwise the game is kind of a plane

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.270 
otherwise the game is kind of a plane
crash<00:03:04.870> in<00:03:05.290> fact<00:03:05.739> I<00:03:05.830> think<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.100> games

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
crash in fact I think the games

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.130 
crash in fact I think the games
backgrounds<00:03:07.000> are<00:03:07.090> indicative<00:03:07.330> of<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:07.870> entire

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.229 
package usually pretty empty pretty
boring<00:03:11.019> not<00:03:11.769> much<00:03:11.980> seems<00:03:12.430> to<00:03:12.640> have<00:03:12.760> gone<00:03:12.970> into

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
boring not much seems to have gone into

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.449 
boring not much seems to have gone into
it<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:13.900> game<00:03:14.050> looks<00:03:14.350> awful<00:03:14.620> sounds<00:03:15.220> even

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
it the game looks awful sounds even

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.190 
it the game looks awful sounds even
worse<00:03:15.489> I<00:03:16.000> guess<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:16.570> best<00:03:16.720> thing<00:03:16.930> you<00:03:17.019> can<00:03:17.140> say

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
worse I guess the best thing you can say

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.259 
worse I guess the best thing you can say
about<00:03:17.410> it<00:03:17.650> is<00:03:17.920> that<00:03:17.980> it<00:03:18.190> plays<00:03:18.400> okay<00:03:18.820> it's

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
about it is that it plays okay it's

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.080 
about it is that it plays okay it's
generic<00:03:19.810> and<00:03:20.200> uninspired<00:03:20.920> but<00:03:21.459> functionally

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
generic and uninspired but functionally

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.930 
generic and uninspired but functionally
it<00:03:22.810> plays<00:03:23.260> okay

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
it plays okay

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.820 
it plays okay
alright<00:03:24.940> maybe<00:03:25.330> calling<00:03:25.720> it<00:03:25.840> a<00:03:25.870> plane<00:03:26.200> crashes

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
alright maybe calling it a plane crashes

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.890 
alright maybe calling it a plane crashes
a<00:03:27.070> little<00:03:27.459> extreme<00:03:27.850> it's<00:03:28.150> not<00:03:28.330> that<00:03:28.480> bad

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
a little extreme it's not that bad

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.060 
a little extreme it's not that bad
it's<00:03:29.140> one<00:03:29.260> of<00:03:29.290> those<00:03:29.440> games<00:03:29.709> that's<00:03:29.890> so

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
it's one of those games that's so

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.520 
it's one of those games that's so
average<00:03:30.580> and<00:03:30.970> nondistinct<00:03:31.450> it's<00:03:32.230> almost
