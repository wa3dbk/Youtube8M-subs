00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
it just for that so I'm trying to like

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.530 
it just for that so I'm trying to like
find<00:01:59.040> some<00:01:59.280> external<00:01:59.549> microphone<00:02:00.090> options

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
find some external microphone options

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.080 
find some external microphone options
for<00:02:00.869> other<00:02:01.560> things<00:02:02.100> but<00:02:02.310> it's<00:02:02.490> not<00:02:02.729> really

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
for other things but it's not really

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.359 
for other things but it's not really
working<00:02:03.240> out<00:02:03.540> so<00:02:04.380> i've<00:02:04.619> also<00:02:04.829> been<00:02:04.979> looking

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
working out so i've also been looking

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.760 
working out so i've also been looking
into<00:02:05.520> getting<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:06.210> camera<00:02:07.200> holder<00:02:07.469> for<00:02:07.619> this

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
into getting a camera holder for this

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.390 
into getting a camera holder for this
camera<00:02:07.979> right<00:02:08.160> here<00:02:08.220> that<00:02:08.940> will<00:02:09.600> allow<00:02:09.899> me<00:02:10.110> to

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.400 
camera right here that will allow me to

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.070 
camera right here that will allow me to
suction<00:02:11.400> cup<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.150> my<00:02:12.300> window<00:02:12.660> i<00:02:12.690> guess

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
suction cup it to my window i guess

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.630 
suction cup it to my window i guess
because<00:02:13.379> i<00:02:13.560> can't<00:02:13.800> really<00:02:13.890> take<00:02:14.069> a<00:02:14.099> trifle

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
because i can't really take a trifle

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.580 
because i can't really take a trifle
in<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.970> car<00:02:15.210> it's<00:02:15.840> going<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.080> fall<00:02:16.260> over<00:02:16.290> and

in the car it's going to fall over and

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.890 
in the car it's going to fall over and
not<00:02:17.280> look<00:02:17.490> nice<00:02:17.700> at<00:02:17.880> all<00:02:17.970> unfortunately<00:02:18.210> but

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
not look nice at all unfortunately but

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.600 
not look nice at all unfortunately but
yeah<00:02:19.380> I<00:02:19.410> want<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.650> get<00:02:19.709> those<00:02:19.860> out<00:02:20.010> as<00:02:20.220> soon<00:02:20.490> as

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
yeah I want to get those out as soon as

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.460 
yeah I want to get those out as soon as
possible<00:02:21.120> i'm<00:02:21.540> planning<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:21.930> go<00:02:21.990> and<00:02:22.200> do<00:02:22.290> some

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
possible i'm planning to go and do some

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.220 
possible i'm planning to go and do some
amazon<00:02:22.920> searching<00:02:23.370> after<00:02:23.459> this<00:02:23.730> for<00:02:24.000> a

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
amazon searching after this for a

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.640 
amazon searching after this for a
suction<00:02:25.230> cup<00:02:25.410> sort<00:02:26.100> of<00:02:26.220> mount<00:02:26.580> for<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.060> camera

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
suction cup sort of mount for the camera

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.630 
suction cup sort of mount for the camera
this<00:02:28.650> would<00:02:28.770> be<00:02:28.800> better<00:02:29.010> quality<00:02:29.459> than<00:02:29.490> a

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
this would be better quality than a

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.390 
this would be better quality than a
GoPro<00:02:29.940> as<00:02:30.090> well<00:02:30.240> so<00:02:30.390> that'd<00:02:30.510> be<00:02:30.660> cool<00:02:31.280> but<00:02:32.280> the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
GoPro as well so that'd be cool but the

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.980 
GoPro as well so that'd be cool but the
microphone<00:02:32.880> might<00:02:33.090> not<00:02:33.240> be<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.480> best<00:02:33.660> on<00:02:33.810> this

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
microphone might not be the best on this

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.780 
microphone might not be the best on this
so<00:02:34.200> my<00:02:34.560> problem<00:02:35.190> stems<00:02:35.490> back<00:02:35.490> to<00:02:36.020> stage<00:02:37.020> one

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
so my problem stems back to stage one

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.830 
so my problem stems back to stage one
unfortunately<00:02:38.790> another<00:02:39.240> thing<00:02:39.570> I'm<00:02:39.660> going<00:02:39.780> to
