these<00:05:47.430> like<00:05:47.730> effect<00:05:48.060> features<00:05:48.390> and<00:05:48.900> as<00:05:49.110> you

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
these like effect features and as you

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.190 
these like effect features and as you
can<00:05:49.350> see<00:05:49.380> as<00:05:49.800> I<00:05:50.460> move<00:05:50.490> the<00:05:51.420> animation<00:05:51.960> moves

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
can see as I move the animation moves

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.320 
can see as I move the animation moves
with<00:05:52.440> me<00:05:52.650> so<00:05:53.070> the<00:05:53.190> life<00:05:53.400> affects<00:05:53.760> actually

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
with me so the life affects actually

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.540 
with me so the life affects actually
basically<00:05:54.540> then<00:05:54.990> based<00:05:55.290> on<00:05:55.470> very<00:05:55.860> good<00:05:55.920> period

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
basically then based on very good period

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.450 
basically then based on very good period
and<00:05:56.730> it<00:05:57.230> sophisticated<00:05:58.230> graphical<00:05:59.130> filters

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
and it sophisticated graphical filters

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.820 
and it sophisticated graphical filters
that<00:06:00.180> allows<00:06:00.450> us<00:06:00.630> to<00:06:00.750> kind<00:06:00.840> of<00:06:00.990> implement<00:06:01.590> this

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
that allows us to kind of implement this

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.320 
that allows us to kind of implement this
feature<00:06:02.070> while<00:06:02.430> the<00:06:02.670> person<00:06:02.820> is<00:06:03.030> actually

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
feature while the person is actually

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.200 
feature while the person is actually
moving<00:06:03.710> so<00:06:04.710> this<00:06:04.830> is<00:06:04.860> live<00:06:05.070> effects<00:06:05.370> Amy<00:06:06.000> turns

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
moving so this is live effects Amy turns

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.030 
moving so this is live effects Amy turns
off<00:06:06.390> I<00:06:06.690> don't<00:06:07.020> like<00:06:07.140> myself<00:06:07.320> this<00:06:07.590> way

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:09.040 
off I don't like myself this way

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.050 
off I don't like myself this way
the<00:06:10.040> other<00:06:10.160> cool<00:06:10.280> feature<00:06:10.490> is<00:06:10.610> called

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.060 
the other cool feature is called

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.600 
the other cool feature is called
panorama<00:06:11.630> mode<00:06:11.840> so<00:06:12.830> let's<00:06:13.010> assume<00:06:13.130> I<00:06:13.370> want<00:06:13.490> to

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
panorama mode so let's assume I want to

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.940 
panorama mode so let's assume I want to
take<00:06:13.700> a<00:06:13.730> panoramic<00:06:14.270> picture<00:06:14.710> used<00:06:15.710> to<00:06:15.770> be<00:06:15.830> the

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:15.950 
take a panoramic picture used to be the

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
take a panoramic picture used to be the
case<00:06:16.130> that<00:06:16.220> you<00:06:16.280> have<00:06:16.460> to<00:06:16.580> stitch<00:06:16.790> these

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:16.970 
case that you have to stitch these

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.030 
case that you have to stitch these
pictures<00:06:17.360> together<00:06:17.510> not<00:06:18.320> anymore<00:06:18.590> and<00:06:18.889> now

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:19.040 
pictures together not anymore and now

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.820 
pictures together not anymore and now
what<00:06:19.220> I<00:06:19.310> can<00:06:19.490> do<00:06:19.639> I<00:06:19.850> can<00:06:20.090> just<00:06:20.330> I<00:06:20.630> could<00:06:21.620> just

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:21.830 
what I can do I can just I could just

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.660 
what I can do I can just I could just
move<00:06:22.100> the<00:06:22.340> camera<00:06:23.020> in<00:06:24.020> one<00:06:24.080> smooth

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:25.670 
move the camera in one smooth

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.950 
move the camera in one smooth
like<00:06:26.330> that

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:36.070 

it<00:06:30.960> even<00:06:31.290> tells<00:06:31.410> me<00:06:31.590> when<00:06:31.710> I'm<00:06:31.800> going<00:06:32.040> too<00:06:32.160> fast

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.480 

what

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:40.490 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.460 

we<00:06:41.490> go<00:06:41.639> and<00:06:42.540> I<00:06:42.630> have<00:06:42.780> a<00:06:42.810> panoramic<00:06:43.080> picture

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:43.470 
we go and I have a panoramic picture

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:46.939 
we go and I have a panoramic picture
nothing<00:06:44.340> to<00:06:44.460> do<00:06:44.610> just<00:06:44.790> one<00:06:45.360> sweet<00:06:45.660> one<00:06:45.949> sweep

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:46.949 
nothing to do just one sweet one sweep

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:48.290 
nothing to do just one sweet one sweep
and<00:06:47.220> I<00:06:47.310> have<00:06:47.430> the<00:06:47.520> camera<00:06:47.820> automatically

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:48.300 
and I have the camera automatically

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.820 
and I have the camera automatically
experiment<00:06:49.050> pictures<00:06:49.350> and<00:06:49.500> stitches

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:49.830 
experiment pictures and stitches

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.719 
experiment pictures and stitches
everything<00:06:50.190> together<00:06:50.550> properly

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:51.729 
everything together properly

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:53.820 
everything together properly
so<00:06:52.180> that's<00:06:52.360> panorama<00:06:52.719> mode<00:06:52.900> these<00:06:53.620> are<00:06:53.770> the

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:53.830 
so that's panorama mode these are the

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.969 
so that's panorama mode these are the
key<00:06:54.009> the<00:06:54.460> key<00:06:54.639> features<00:06:54.999> of<00:06:55.029> android<00:06:55.449> 4.0<00:06:55.979> if

00:06:56.969 --> 00:06:56.979 
key the key features of android 4.0 if

00:06:56.979 --> 00:06:58.739 
key the key features of android 4.0 if
the<00:06:57.159> devotionals<00:06:57.490> getting<00:06:58.150> involved<00:06:58.330> in<00:06:58.599> that

00:06:58.739 --> 00:06:58.749 
the devotionals getting involved in that

00:06:58.749 --> 00:07:02.640 
the devotionals getting involved in that
and<00:06:59.050> the<00:06:59.319> OS<00:06:59.589> you<00:07:00.520> multitasking<00:07:01.529> so<00:07:02.529> the

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:02.650 
and the OS you multitasking so the
