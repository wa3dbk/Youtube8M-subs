like I confused and that yes I do get
confused<00:02:26.610> with<00:02:26.850> scientific<00:02:27.420> calculators<00:02:28.020> I

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
confused with scientific calculators I

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.670 
confused with scientific calculators I
know<00:02:29.100> I'm<00:02:29.460> just<00:02:29.700> kind<00:02:30.090> of<00:02:30.210> like<00:02:30.330> a<00:02:30.420> caveman<00:02:30.680> so

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
know I'm just kind of like a caveman so

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.700 
know I'm just kind of like a caveman so
um<00:02:31.950> here<00:02:32.940> are<00:02:32.970> my<00:02:33.300> erasers<00:02:33.960> so<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.320> just<00:02:34.590> keep

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
um here are my erasers so I just keep

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.440 
um here are my erasers so I just keep
them<00:02:34.860> like<00:02:34.980> that<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:35.850> I<00:02:36.030> like<00:02:36.180> that<00:02:36.330> because

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
them like that and I like that because

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.780 
them like that and I like that because
then<00:02:36.630> I<00:02:36.690> don't<00:02:36.720> have<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:36.960> have<00:02:37.140> one<00:02:37.350> of<00:02:37.380> those

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
then I don't have to have one of those

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.920 
then I don't have to have one of those
pencil<00:02:38.790> cases<00:02:38.910> that<00:02:39.150> attach<00:02:39.390> into<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.690> binder

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
pencil cases that attach into the binder

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.570 
pencil cases that attach into the binder
so<00:02:40.140> I<00:02:40.170> find<00:02:40.500> those<00:02:40.650> really<00:02:40.860> distracting

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
so I find those really distracting

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.090 
so I find those really distracting
I<00:02:41.610> just<00:02:42.480> keep<00:02:42.630> dividers<00:02:43.440> I<00:02:43.590> don't<00:02:43.740> like<00:02:43.890> sheet

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.550 
I just keep dividers I don't like sheet
protectors<00:02:44.610> because<00:02:44.990> they<00:02:45.990> just<00:02:46.140> take<00:02:46.380> too

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
protectors because they just take too

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.770 
protectors because they just take too
long<00:02:46.800> to<00:02:46.860> put<00:02:47.280> into<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.730> sheet<00:02:48.330> things<00:02:48.540> and

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
long to put into the sheet things and

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.840 
long to put into the sheet things and
take<00:02:48.960> up<00:02:49.050> a<00:02:49.110> lot<00:02:49.260> of<00:02:49.290> time<00:02:49.560> so<00:02:50.430> I<00:02:50.460> don't<00:02:50.610> take

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
take up a lot of time so I don't take

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.400 
take up a lot of time so I don't take
those<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:51.390> then<00:02:51.480> I<00:02:51.510> love<00:02:51.900> this<00:02:52.470> thing<00:02:53.460> here

the nutrition Tuesday I have humanities
computer<00:04:43.460> lab<00:04:43.639> lunch<00:04:44.180> uh<00:04:45.460> it's<00:04:46.460> kind<00:04:46.699> of<00:04:46.729> weird

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
computer lab lunch uh it's kind of weird

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.790 
computer lab lunch uh it's kind of weird
because<00:04:46.970> I<00:04:47.240> have<00:04:47.360> mass<00:04:47.690> health<00:04:48.139> and<00:04:48.350> art<00:04:48.560> all

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
because I have mass health and art all

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.379 
because I have mass health and art all
in<00:04:48.949> the<00:04:49.039> same<00:04:49.190> room<00:04:49.250> and<00:04:49.639> by<00:04:49.759> the<00:04:49.820> same<00:04:50.090> teacher

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
in the same room and by the same teacher

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.659 
in the same room and by the same teacher
so<00:04:51.289> I<00:04:51.320> don't<00:04:51.590> actually<00:04:51.710> know<00:04:52.070> what<00:04:52.280> class<00:04:52.490> that

so I don't actually know what class that

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:55.420 
so I don't actually know what class that
is<00:04:52.759> I'm<00:04:52.850> guessing<00:04:53.000> it's<00:04:53.300> math<00:04:53.780> and<00:04:54.229> then<00:04:55.190> some

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
is I'm guessing it's math and then some

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.340 
is I'm guessing it's math and then some
days<00:04:55.610> it'll<00:04:55.820> be<00:04:55.940> health<00:04:56.600> and<00:04:56.810> edge<00:04:56.900> I<00:04:57.169> don't

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350
