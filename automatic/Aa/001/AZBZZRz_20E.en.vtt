two Stratocasters you might recognize
the<00:00:09.630> one<00:00:09.780> on<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:09.990> right<00:00:10.170> that<00:00:10.740> is<00:00:10.769> my<00:00:11.130> American

the one on the right that is my American

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.879 
the one on the right that is my American

specials in and the one on the left is a

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.890 
specials in and the one on the left is a
Mexican<00:00:17.670> strat<00:00:17.940> that<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.180> picked<00:00:18.449> up<00:00:18.570> tonight

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
Mexican strat that I picked up tonight

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.260 
Mexican strat that I picked up tonight
got<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.350> really<00:00:19.619> good<00:00:19.890> deal<00:00:20.160> on<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.760> I<00:00:21.240> just

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
got a really good deal on it and I just

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.269 
got a really good deal on it and I just
brought<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:21.750> home<00:00:21.869> this<00:00:22.050> evening<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:23.220> I

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
brought it home this evening so I

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.859 
brought it home this evening so I
thought<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:23.760> would<00:00:23.939> be<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.090> good<00:00:24.300> time<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.570> do

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
thought this would be a good time to do

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.410 
thought this would be a good time to do
a<00:00:24.900> little<00:00:25.080> bit<00:00:25.289> of<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.500> comparison<00:00:26.070> between<00:00:26.880> a

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
a little bit of a comparison between a

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.500 
a little bit of a comparison between a
Mexican<00:00:28.170> made<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.619> an<00:00:28.800> American<00:00:29.699> made<00:00:29.880> guitar

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
Mexican made and an American made guitar

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.959 
Mexican made and an American made guitar
I'm<00:00:30.810> not<00:00:31.470> going<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.800> plug<00:00:32.009> them<00:00:32.219> in<00:00:32.399> because<00:00:32.940> I

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
I'm not going to plug them in because I

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.430 
I'm not going to plug them in because I
wouldn't<00:00:33.420> be<00:00:33.480> comparing<00:00:33.960> apples<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.350> apples

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
wouldn't be comparing apples to apples

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.970 
wouldn't be comparing apples to apples
because<00:00:34.920> like<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.610> mentioned<00:00:36.059> I've<00:00:36.180> got

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
because like I mentioned I've got

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.619 
because like I mentioned I've got
non-stock<00:00:37.980> pickups<00:00:38.489> on<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.879> American<00:00:39.420> and

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
non-stock pickups on the American and

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.130 
non-stock pickups on the American and
what's<00:00:40.620> on<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.070> Mexican<00:00:41.610> are<00:00:41.820> stock<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:42.840> it

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
what's on the Mexican are stock so it

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.500 
what's on the Mexican are stock so it
wouldn't<00:00:43.320> be<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.469> fair<00:00:43.680> comparison<00:00:44.510> we're

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
wouldn't be a fair comparison we're

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.170 
wouldn't be a fair comparison we're
going<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.809> look<00:00:46.020> instead<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.969> materials<00:00:47.969> and

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
going to look instead and materials and

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.900 
going to look instead and materials and
construction<00:00:49.010> so<00:00:50.010> starting<00:00:50.640> with<00:00:50.760> the

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
construction so starting with the

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.119 
construction so starting with the
headstock<00:00:51.420> well<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.110> can<00:00:52.260> see<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.559> color<00:00:52.860> is

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
headstock well you can see the color is

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.459 
headstock well you can see the color is
different<00:00:53.340> on<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.760> two<00:00:53.910> guitars<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.570> really

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
different on the two guitars I really

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.380 
different on the two guitars I really
haven't<00:00:55.860> looked<00:00:56.039> up<00:00:56.280> how<00:00:56.520> old<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.910> Mexican

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
haven't looked up how old the Mexican

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.139 
haven't looked up how old the Mexican
one<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.780> but<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.530> believe<00:00:59.039> it's<00:00:59.370> at<00:00:59.520> least<00:00:59.730> 10

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
one is but I believe it's at least 10

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.779 
one is but I believe it's at least 10
years<00:01:00.329> old<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:01.800> know<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.520> American

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
years old and I know that the American

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.219 
years old and I know that the American
one<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.750> about<00:01:04.080> 14<00:01:04.680> years<00:01:04.920> old<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:06.020> they<00:01:07.020> both

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
one is about 14 years old so they both

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.250 
one is about 14 years old so they both
have<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.470> little<00:01:07.680> bit<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.040> age<00:01:08.159> on<00:01:08.430> them<00:01:08.520> now

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
have a little bit of age on them now

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.740 
have a little bit of age on them now
everything<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.380> shaped<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.070> same<00:01:11.390> the<00:01:12.390> bodies

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
everything is shaped the same the bodies

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.390 
everything is shaped the same the bodies
are<00:01:12.930> shaped<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.290> same<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.770> necks<00:01:14.010> are<00:01:14.189> shaped

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
are shaped the same the necks are shaped

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.359 
are shaped the same the necks are shaped
the<00:01:14.549> same<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.140> we're<00:01:16.140> kind<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.409> fuzzy<00:01:16.650> it'll

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
the same and we're kind of fuzzy it'll

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.969 
the same and we're kind of fuzzy it'll
come<00:01:17.549> back<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.450> head<00:01:18.630> stalks<00:01:19.049> are<00:01:19.619> shaped

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
come back and the head stalks are shaped

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.359 
come back and the head stalks are shaped
the<00:01:20.130> same<00:01:21.200> come<00:01:22.200> on<00:01:22.350> back<00:01:22.530> there<00:01:22.950> we<00:01:23.070> go

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
the same come on back there we go

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.760 
the same come on back there we go
auto<00:01:24.000> focus<00:01:24.270> for<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.930> okay<00:01:25.560> on<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.570> American

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
auto focus for you okay on the American

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.649 
auto focus for you okay on the American
you<00:01:28.770> can<00:01:28.920> see<00:01:29.130> we've<00:01:29.340> got<00:01:29.549> two<00:01:29.939> string<00:01:30.299> trees

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
you can see we've got two string trees

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.300 
you can see we've got two string trees
and<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:30.990> can<00:01:31.170> see<00:01:31.350> they're<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.590> little<00:01:31.680> nicer

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
and you can see they're a little nicer

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.940 
and you can see they're a little nicer
when<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.820> compare<00:01:33.390> them<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:34.259> single

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
when you compare them to the single

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
when you compare them to the single
string<00:01:35.369> tree<00:01:35.700> on<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.090> Mexican<00:01:37.490> if<00:01:38.490> we<00:01:38.610> can<00:01:38.820> get

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
string tree on the Mexican if we can get

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.999 
string tree on the Mexican if we can get
that<00:01:39.150> in<00:01:39.329> focus<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.930> would<00:01:40.110> be<00:01:40.259> SuperDuper

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
that in focus that would be SuperDuper

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.530 
that in focus that would be SuperDuper
there<00:01:41.880> we<00:01:42.090> go

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
there we go

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.020 
there we go
you<00:01:43.530> see<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.860> difference<00:01:44.250> there<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.729> little

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
you see the difference there a little

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.080 
you see the difference there a little
nicer

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
nicer

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.530 
nicer
and<00:01:48.090> those<00:01:48.990> are<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.579> keep<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.820> angle<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.390> the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
and those are to keep the angle of the

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.590 
and those are to keep the angle of the
string<00:01:51.869> in<00:01:52.049> relation<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.829> nut<00:01:53.070> at<00:01:53.820> you

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
string in relation to the nut at you

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.429 
string in relation to the nut at you
know<00:01:54.720> an<00:01:54.899> optimum<00:01:55.409> angle<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:56.570> see<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.960> was<00:01:58.290> too

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
know an optimum angle I see I was too

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.429 
know an optimum angle I see I was too
close<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:58.950> I'm<00:01:59.430> gonna<00:01:59.549> back<00:01:59.759> up<00:01:59.820> a<00:02:00.090> bit

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439

off because the tremolo isn't something
that<00:04:32.840> I<00:04:32.990> use<00:04:33.340> the<00:04:34.340> metal<00:04:34.820> of<00:04:35.030> the<00:04:35.090> two<00:04:35.720> tremolo

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380

blocks<00:04:36.680> is<00:04:36.950> different<00:04:37.490> I<00:04:37.670> don't<00:04:38.330> know<00:04:38.420> what

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
blocks is different I don't know what

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.230

they're<00:04:38.720> made<00:04:38.870> of<00:04:39.080> but<00:04:39.760> they<00:04:40.760> look<00:04:41.090> different

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.160 

anyway<00:04:45.580> overall<00:04:46.580> I<00:04:46.910> really<00:04:47.450> like<00:04:47.810> strats

anyway overall I really like strats

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.080 
anyway overall I really like strats
because<00:04:48.620> you<00:04:48.800> can<00:04:48.980> use<00:04:49.220> them<00:04:49.400> to<00:04:49.610> play<00:04:49.760> just

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
because you can use them to play just

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.900 
because you can use them to play just
about<00:04:50.300> any<00:04:50.570> style<00:04:50.900> of<00:04:51.020> music<00:04:51.250> blues<00:04:52.250> country

rock metal some people may disagree with
that<00:04:57.260> I<00:04:57.470> think<00:04:57.860> if<00:04:58.040> you<00:04:58.160> put<00:04:58.340> the<00:04:58.610> proper

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.180 
that I think if you put the proper
pickups<00:04:59.360> on<00:04:59.510> it<00:04:59.630> you<00:04:59.720> can<00:04:59.900> play<00:05:00.020> just<00:05:01.010> about
