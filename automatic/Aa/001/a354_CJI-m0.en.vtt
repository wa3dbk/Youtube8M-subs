the first will need to understand how
rotor<00:00:21.210> blades<00:00:21.449> can<00:00:21.689> move<00:00:21.900> they<00:00:22.199> can<00:00:22.320> move<00:00:22.439> in

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
rotor blades can move they can move in

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.630 
rotor blades can move they can move in
three<00:00:22.949> main<00:00:23.550> ways<00:00:23.900> they<00:00:24.900> can<00:00:25.140> twist<00:00:25.590> or<00:00:26.130> pitch

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
three main ways they can twist or pitch

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.960 
three main ways they can twist or pitch
or<00:00:27.300> feather<00:00:27.689> as<00:00:27.900> it's<00:00:28.050> known<00:00:28.230> as<00:00:28.789> they<00:00:29.789> can

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
or feather as it's known as they can

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.269 
or feather as it's known as they can
also<00:00:30.150> move<00:00:31.080> up<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.439> down<00:00:31.590> when<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.859> flapping

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
also move up and down when a flapping

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.690 
also move up and down when a flapping
motion<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.290> they<00:00:34.290> can<00:00:34.410> also<00:00:34.530> seek<00:00:35.070> forward

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
motion and they can also seek forward

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.060 
motion and they can also seek forward
and<00:00:35.820> backwards<00:00:36.239> along<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.290> tip<00:00:37.500> plane<00:00:37.800> in

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
and backwards along the tip plane in

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.459 
and backwards along the tip plane in
what's<00:00:38.730> known<00:00:38.940> as<00:00:39.000> lead<00:00:39.780> lag<00:00:40.110> or<00:00:40.440> hunting<00:00:42.469> so

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
what's known as lead lag or hunting so

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.660 
what's known as lead lag or hunting so
now<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.649> understand<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.190> different<00:00:44.489> ways<00:00:44.640> a

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
now you understand the different ways a

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.580

Lac and we'll go through the examples of
each<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.270> a<00:01:09.270> little<00:01:09.420> bit<00:01:09.510> more<00:01:09.630> detail<00:01:10.189> so

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
each and a little bit more detail so

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.620 
each and a little bit more detail so
here<00:01:11.340> we<00:01:11.430> have<00:01:11.520> an<00:01:11.610> example<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.210> rigid<00:01:12.420> rotor

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
here we have an example of a rigid rotor

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.140 
here we have an example of a rigid rotor
system<00:01:13.110> it's<00:01:13.229> on<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> bo<00:01:13.680> 105<00:01:14.070> otherwise<00:01:14.939> known

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
system it's on a bo 105 otherwise known

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.450 
system it's on a bo 105 otherwise known
as<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.360> red<00:01:15.540> ball<00:01:15.689> helicopter<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.250> idea

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
as the red ball helicopter and the idea

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.940 
as the red ball helicopter and the idea
with<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.640> rigid<00:01:17.939> rotor<00:01:17.970> system<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.720> the

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
with the rigid rotor system is that the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.920 
with the rigid rotor system is that the
rotor<00:01:19.950> blades<00:01:20.640> themselves<00:01:20.850> can<00:01:21.420> individually

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
rotor blades themselves can individually

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.100 
rotor blades themselves can individually
feather<00:01:22.259> but<00:01:23.009> any<00:01:23.189> other<00:01:23.939> motion<00:01:24.479> in<00:01:24.630> terms<00:01:24.869> of

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
feather but any other motion in terms of

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.460 
feather but any other motion in terms of
lead<00:01:25.619> lag<00:01:25.920> or<00:01:26.330> flapping<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.509> done<00:01:27.990> by<00:01:28.170> bending

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
lead lag or flapping is done by bending

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.420 
lead lag or flapping is done by bending
of<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.979> blades<00:01:30.409> so<00:01:31.409> here's<00:01:31.650> an<00:01:31.740> example<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.220> a

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
of the blades so here's an example of a

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.640 
of the blades so here's an example of a
semi<00:01:32.729> rigid<00:01:32.939> rotor<00:01:33.240> system<00:01:33.689> this<00:01:33.960> one's<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.380> the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
semi rigid rotor system this one's a the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.060 
semi rigid rotor system this one's a the
r44<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:36.000> r22<00:01:36.540> is<00:01:36.810> very<00:01:37.229> similar<00:01:37.619> just<00:01:37.799> they're

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
r44 the r22 is very similar just they're

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.429 
r44 the r22 is very similar just they're
smaller<00:01:38.400> components<00:01:39.049> this<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.290> main

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
smaller components this is the main

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.270 
smaller components this is the main
rotor<00:01:40.650> system<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.310> r22

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
rotor system of the r22

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.980 
rotor system of the r22
as<00:01:42.850> we<00:01:43.000> talked<00:01:43.150> about<00:01:43.240> earlier<00:01:43.570> this<00:01:43.720> is<00:01:43.780> a

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
as we talked about earlier this is a

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.640 
as we talked about earlier this is a
semi-rigid<00:01:44.619> system<00:01:45.220> and<00:01:46.080> we<00:01:47.080> had<00:01:47.260> I'll<00:01:47.500> just

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
semi-rigid system and we had I'll just

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.640 
semi-rigid system and we had I'll just
go<00:01:47.799> through<00:01:47.979> the<00:01:48.040> parts<00:01:48.369> here<00:01:49.409> this<00:01:50.409> is<00:01:50.560> the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
go through the parts here this is the

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.260 
go through the parts here this is the
main<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.170> hinge<00:01:53.380> and<00:01:53.950> this<00:01:54.070> allows<00:01:54.340> this

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
main to the hinge and this allows this

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.330 
main to the hinge and this allows this
system<00:01:55.780> to<00:01:55.990> flap<00:01:56.229> as<00:01:56.380> one<00:01:56.560> unit<00:01:56.920> so<00:01:57.070> as<00:01:57.190> one

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
system to flap as one unit so as one

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.540 
system to flap as one unit so as one
goes<00:01:57.580> up<00:01:57.790> the<00:01:57.909> other<00:01:57.970> one<00:01:58.090> goes<00:01:58.240> down<00:01:59.460> then<00:02:00.460> we

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
goes up the other one goes down then we

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.790 
goes up the other one goes down then we
also<00:02:00.670> have<00:02:00.880> these<00:02:01.030> additional<00:02:01.840> hinges<00:02:02.590> here

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
also have these additional hinges here

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.080 
also have these additional hinges here
these<00:02:02.920> are<00:02:03.040> the<00:02:03.100> coning<00:02:03.550> hinges<00:02:03.880> or<00:02:04.000> the

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
these are the coning hinges or the

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.389 
these are the coning hinges or the
secondary<00:02:04.479> flapping<00:02:05.020> may<00:02:05.680> allow<00:02:05.890> these<00:02:06.070> to

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
secondary flapping may allow these to

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:09.809 
secondary flapping may allow these to
move<00:02:06.520> up<00:02:06.700> a<00:02:06.850> little<00:02:07.090> bit<00:02:07.330> by<00:02:07.570> themselves<00:02:08.819> then

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
move up a little bit by themselves then

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.720 
move up a little bit by themselves then
we<00:02:09.850> have<00:02:10.119> this<00:02:11.050> brown<00:02:11.380> piece<00:02:11.650> here<00:02:11.920> this<00:02:12.580> is

the pitch bearing housing this allows

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.270 
the pitch bearing housing this allows
this<00:02:15.459> entire<00:02:15.910> blade<00:02:16.209> to<00:02:17.080> rotate<00:02:17.680> get<00:02:18.070> your

this entire blade to rotate get your
feather<00:02:19.410> here<00:02:20.410> we<00:02:20.470> have<00:02:20.590> an<00:02:20.650> example<00:02:20.980> of<00:02:21.340> a

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
feather here we have an example of a

fully articulated rotor system so
Schweitzer<00:02:23.980> 300<00:02:24.610> helicopter<00:02:25.600> any<00:02:26.140> idea<00:02:26.440> like

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
Schweitzer 300 helicopter any idea like

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.170 
Schweitzer 300 helicopter any idea like
we<00:02:26.739> already<00:02:26.950> said<00:02:27.160> with<00:02:27.310> a<00:02:27.340> fully<00:02:27.610> articulated

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
we already said with a fully articulated

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.720 
we already said with a fully articulated
system<00:02:28.569> is<00:02:28.690> that<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:29.019> blades<00:02:29.730> individually

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
system is that the blades individually

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.040 
system is that the blades individually
flap<00:02:31.470> feather<00:02:32.470> and<00:02:32.769> lead<00:02:33.550> lag<00:02:34.050> sometimes

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
flap feather and lead lag sometimes

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.420 
flap feather and lead lag sometimes
there<00:02:35.350> may<00:02:35.440> be<00:02:35.470> more<00:02:35.709> than<00:02:35.769> one<00:02:36.010> hinge<00:02:36.250> for

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
there may be more than one hinge for

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.520 
there may be more than one hinge for
each<00:02:36.519> one<00:02:36.700> of<00:02:36.790> those<00:02:37.170> obviously<00:02:38.170> this<00:02:38.230> makes<00:02:38.380> a

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
each one of those obviously this makes a

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:39.960 
each one of those obviously this makes a
little<00:02:38.620> bit<00:02:38.739> more<00:02:38.830> complex<00:02:39.400> and<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:39.730> little<00:02:39.880> bit

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
little bit more complex and a little bit

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.030 
little bit more complex and a little bit
more<00:02:40.830> heavy<00:02:41.830> and<00:02:42.400> expensive<00:02:43.650> but<00:02:44.650> there's

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
more heavy and expensive but there's

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.120 
more heavy and expensive but there's
obviously<00:02:45.310> performance<00:02:45.959> benefits<00:02:46.959> and<00:02:47.260> a<00:02:47.980> lot

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
obviously performance benefits and a lot

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.740 
obviously performance benefits and a lot
of<00:02:48.160> helicopters<00:02:48.670> use<00:02:48.820> that<00:02:49.000> system<00:02:49.420> of<00:02:49.630> a

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
of helicopters use that system of a

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.800 
of helicopters use that system of a
