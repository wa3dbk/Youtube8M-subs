00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:06.730
 how about a good night we started 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.730
 talking about the tropics but this time 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:12.430
 about the pacific noten we have two 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.380
 cyclones first is the the storm 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.510
 July tropical july will continue 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.340
 moving to the west 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:21.220
 intensifying but we also have to 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.960
 hurricane and celis he has winds of more 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.660
 of 100 miles per hour is in fact a 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.210
 hurricane category 4 with winds of more 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.590
 of 130 miles per hour and notice is very 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.720
 well defined this is what 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.839
 meteorologically we call it a 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.870
 Perfect storm has a good eye 

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:40.360
 generated and of course its circulation 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.250
 also well defined continues 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.750
 moving to the west this could 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.420
 be impacting the Hawaiian Islands 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.640
 during almost the end of this week 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.350
 labor but fortunately as of 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.089
 that is moving towards the west the 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.970
 winds in height and dry air goes to 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:57.670
 start interacting with this hurricane and 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.140
 will start to weaken it a bit 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.030
 currently as a need it has winds 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.489
 of 130 miles per hour moving towards 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.490
 the west but from here to Thursday by the 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:09.550
 afternoon hawaii hour will be arriving 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.100
 possibly touching the island 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.600
 and will have winds at 65 miles per 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.420
 so maybe it's happening 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.160
 like a good tropical storm this is 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.530
 a very beautiful ark but also in the 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.900
 Atlantic we have a hurricane not also 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.510
 defined this alone ercan berta noten 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.480
 as it is totally scattered there 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.550
 you know if circular or not circular I think 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.770
 that already for the next bulletin that comes out 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.920
 at five in the morning they could already 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.750
 be lowering him and his intensity a bit 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.460
 more to make a very tropical storm 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.650
 little notice will continue on water is the 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.300
 Atlantic without affecting the coasts 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.590
 Americans, you are good 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.940
 news good news for us 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.550
 also because tonight the situation 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.900
 it is quite calm yes 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.300
 we continue with the humidity enough 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.950
 present therefore the temperatures still at 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.440
 this time of night they feel as if 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.630
 they were almost almost 90 degrees 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.880
 at least on katy and noten in houston 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.980
 at the intercontinental airport the 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.650
 temperature marks about 78 degrees but it 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.150
 feel like 81 degrees do not have the 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.950
 downpours we had this afternoon 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.890
 quickly 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.930
 and they lost so to speak once 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.610
 the sun was hidden for tomorrow the same 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.530
 meteorological pattern some of these 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.360
 showers will be very short 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.950
 duration I'm not expecting high 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.290
 accumulated in if we are going to have a 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.120
 Quite calm morning we will continue 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.530
 with a high pressure system but the 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.239
 local effects such as 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.250
 daytime heating and sea breeze 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.170
 are the ones that are going to be causing the 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.940
 risk of having some downpours and 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.799
 showers during the course of the 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.450
 late temperatures that were going to go 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:40.060
 the increase notice that for Friday 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.680
 I have no chance of rain 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.880
 but the heat will be intense 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.250
 temperatures that are going to be 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.930
 approaching the three digits so 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.930
 start to hydrate happy
