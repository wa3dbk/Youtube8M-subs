00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.799 

hi<00:00:05.680> my<00:00:05.950> name<00:00:06.099> is<00:00:06.129> Marc<00:00:06.490> with<00:00:06.879> Michigan<00:00:07.299> biochar

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:07.809 
hi my name is Marc with Michigan biochar

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:11.430 
hi my name is Marc with Michigan biochar
we're<00:00:08.709> on<00:00:08.889> part<00:00:09.190> three<00:00:09.670> of<00:00:09.910> our<00:00:10.539> biochar

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:11.440 
we're on part three of our biochar

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.029 
we're on part three of our biochar
experiment<00:00:12.129> with<00:00:12.459> tomato<00:00:13.029> plants<00:00:14.039> we're

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:15.039 
experiment with tomato plants we're

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:17.040 
experiment with tomato plants we're
already<00:00:15.309> at<00:00:15.520> step<00:00:15.820> three<00:00:16.180> we're<00:00:16.720> probably

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.050 
already at step three we're probably

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.830 
already at step three we're probably
just<00:00:17.289> gonna<00:00:17.590> run<00:00:17.830> this<00:00:17.980> to<00:00:18.220> step<00:00:19.029> five<00:00:19.330> or<00:00:19.539> six

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840 
just gonna run this to step five or six

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.380 
just gonna run this to step five or six
and<00:00:20.080> that<00:00:20.199> should<00:00:20.410> be<00:00:20.590> it<00:00:20.800> so<00:00:21.160> hopefully<00:00:22.000> this

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390 
and that should be it so hopefully this

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.910 
and that should be it so hopefully this
whole<00:00:22.600> thing<00:00:22.810> will<00:00:22.990> culminate<00:00:23.289> at<00:00:23.530> the<00:00:23.770> end

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:23.920 
whole thing will culminate at the end

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.390 
whole thing will culminate at the end
where<00:00:24.190> we'll<00:00:24.369> show<00:00:24.730> you<00:00:24.810> where<00:00:25.810> the<00:00:26.680> plants

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.400 
where we'll show you where the plants

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.349 
where we'll show you where the plants
that<00:00:28.170> have<00:00:29.170> been<00:00:29.619> planted<00:00:30.130> in<00:00:30.520> a<00:00:31.330> compost<00:00:32.050> soil

00:00:33.349 --> 00:00:33.359 
that have been planted in a compost soil

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:37.200 
that have been planted in a compost soil
biochar<00:00:34.359> combination<00:00:35.340> will<00:00:36.340> prove<00:00:36.699> itself<00:00:36.879> to

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
biochar combination will prove itself to

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.770 
biochar combination will prove itself to
be<00:00:37.449> superior<00:00:37.989> to<00:00:39.089> plants<00:00:40.089> that<00:00:40.269> otherwise<00:00:40.719> are

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
be superior to plants that otherwise are

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.110 
be superior to plants that otherwise are
not<00:00:40.979> so<00:00:41.979> I<00:00:42.010> just<00:00:42.219> want<00:00:42.609> to<00:00:42.699> do<00:00:42.819> a<00:00:42.850> real<00:00:43.089> quick

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
not so I just want to do a real quick

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.180

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
over here there should be four but there

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.739

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.630 
grow
soil<00:02:12.340> these<00:02:13.060> plants<00:02:13.780> came<00:02:14.080> out<00:02:14.260> very<00:02:15.250> very

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
soil these plants came out very very

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.330 
soil these plants came out very very
strong<00:02:16.390> and<00:02:16.629> we<00:02:16.750> expected<00:02:17.290> that<00:02:17.440> because<00:02:17.620> it's

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
strong and we expected that because it's

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.000 
strong and we expected that because it's
very<00:02:18.610> rich<00:02:18.940> in<00:02:18.970> nitrogen<00:02:19.390> so<00:02:20.200> it<00:02:20.530> really<00:02:20.769> took

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
very rich in nitrogen so it really took

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.369 
very rich in nitrogen so it really took
off<00:02:21.159> very<00:02:21.489> quickly<00:02:21.780> when<00:02:22.780> compared<00:02:23.290> to

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
off very quickly when compared to

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.530 
off very quickly when compared to

Scott's Scott's

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.699 
Scott's Scott's
obviously<00:02:27.390> they<00:02:28.390> don't<00:02:28.660> have<00:02:29.019> nearly<00:02:29.349> as<00:02:29.500> much

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
obviously they don't have nearly as much

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.530 
obviously they don't have nearly as much
nitrogen<00:02:30.370> and<00:02:30.519> some<00:02:30.670> other<00:02:30.819> elements<00:02:31.030> so<00:02:31.390> it's

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
nitrogen and some other elements so it's

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.100 
nitrogen and some other elements so it's
not<00:02:31.690> growing<00:02:32.040> nearly<00:02:33.040> as<00:02:33.129> quickly<00:02:33.400> as<00:02:33.610> the

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
not growing nearly as quickly as the

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.690 
not growing nearly as quickly as the
miracle<00:02:35.110> girl<00:02:35.319> that<00:02:35.799> doesn't<00:02:36.099> mean<00:02:36.310> anything

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
miracle girl that doesn't mean anything

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.699 
miracle girl that doesn't mean anything
right<00:02:36.849> this<00:02:37.060> point<00:02:37.360> is<00:02:38.049> probably<00:02:38.290> growing

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
right this point is probably growing

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.069 
right this point is probably growing
healthier<00:02:39.220> this<00:02:39.400> way<00:02:39.640> then<00:02:40.269> this<00:02:40.510> way<00:02:40.569> anyway

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
healthier this way then this way anyway

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.369 
healthier this way then this way anyway
so<00:02:41.140> we'll<00:02:41.680> see<00:02:41.890> this<00:02:42.040> time<00:02:42.250> goes<00:02:42.459> by<00:02:42.870> but<00:02:43.870> this

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
so we'll see this time goes by but this

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:46.619 
so we'll see this time goes by but this

darker green if you compare that with

any of the rest of these plants you can

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139 
see the foliage on it is much darker I

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:36.809 
see the foliage on it is much darker I
don't<00:03:35.319> know<00:03:35.500> what's<00:03:35.799> going<00:03:36.160> on<00:03:36.280> with<00:03:36.489> Scotts

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
don't know what's going on with Scotts

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.960 
don't know what's going on with Scotts
but<00:03:37.150> we<00:03:37.299> see<00:03:37.510> it<00:03:37.630> with<00:03:38.590> this<00:03:38.739> row<00:03:38.980> as<00:03:39.130> well<00:03:39.370> so<00:03:39.700> I

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
but we see it with this row as well so I

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.420 
but we see it with this row as well so I
don't<00:03:40.599> know<00:03:40.959> what<00:03:41.380> that<00:03:41.560> means<00:03:41.799> at<00:03:41.950> this<00:03:42.069> point

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
don't know what that means at this point

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.479 
don't know what that means at this point
but<00:03:43.079> it<00:03:44.079> certainly<00:03:44.349> doesn't<00:03:44.769> look<00:03:45.010> like<00:03:45.069> it's

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
but it certainly doesn't look like it's

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.330 
but it certainly doesn't look like it's
growing<00:03:46.450> in<00:03:46.959> either<00:03:47.200> category<00:03:47.470> as<00:03:47.889> vigorous

organic the Miracle Grow
is<00:04:08.730> is<00:04:09.090> growing<00:04:09.360> much<00:04:09.660> more<00:04:09.720> vigorously<00:04:10.410> so

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
is is growing much more vigorously so

is is growing much more vigorously so
like<00:04:11.970> I<00:04:12.090> said<00:04:12.150> hats<00:04:12.570> off<00:04:12.780> to<00:04:12.960> the<00:04:13.050> local<00:04:13.230> farmer

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:13.710 
like I said hats off to the local farmer

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.300 
like I said hats off to the local farmer
with<00:04:13.890> his<00:04:14.100> compost<00:04:14.600> and<00:04:15.709> it's<00:04:16.709> looking<00:04:17.160> right

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
with his compost and it's looking right

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.170 
with his compost and it's looking right
now<00:04:17.549> that<00:04:18.290> overall<00:04:19.290> we've<00:04:19.769> got<00:04:19.799> a<00:04:20.370> pretty<00:04:21.060> good

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
now that overall we've got a pretty good

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.480 
now that overall we've got a pretty good
growth<00:04:21.600> rate<00:04:21.900> on<00:04:22.049> both<00:04:22.230> sides<00:04:22.560> and<00:04:22.920> we'll<00:04:23.160> see

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
growth rate on both sides and we'll see

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.490 
growth rate on both sides and we'll see
in<00:04:23.730> the<00:04:23.880> upcoming<00:04:24.180> weeks<00:04:24.780> and<00:04:25.020> months<00:04:25.320> as

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
in the upcoming weeks and months as

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.400 
in the upcoming weeks and months as
these<00:04:26.340> plants<00:04:26.550> get<00:04:26.910> much<00:04:27.120> larger<00:04:27.390> we'll<00:04:28.140> see

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
these plants get much larger we'll see

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.440 
these plants get much larger we'll see
how<00:04:28.590> the<00:04:28.650> yield<00:04:29.090> comes<00:04:30.090> out<00:04:30.390> with<00:04:31.110> the<00:04:32.450> soils

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
how the yield comes out with the soils

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.600 
how the yield comes out with the soils
with<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:34.080> biochar<00:04:34.680> versus<00:04:35.100> the<00:04:35.190> ones<00:04:35.370> that

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
with the biochar versus the ones that

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.160 
with the biochar versus the ones that
don't<00:04:35.790> so<00:04:36.210> we'll<00:04:36.960> be<00:04:37.170> talking<00:04:37.800> soon
