00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.449

 at least that was what you saw 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.150
 I invited there right on the spot too 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.400
 to be there and watch 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.410
 You must know that I am full of poker 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.150
 fan and samples and therefore from this 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.250
 Grund really wanted to go there 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.399
 I can not even handle the rules 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.480
 I have to honestly say the topic I can 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.040
 I now still full of it because 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.940
 Go to case youtuber area too 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.079
 see and so on 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.820
 forgiven briefly with them and again 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.020
 some are soon to life again 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.590
 Of course there is nothing to see 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.200
 cool thing 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.000

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.160

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.469
 free drinks what more could you want 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.390
 who the fuck would that says no such ak 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.430
 something is also good in the live show 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.260
 but it's also a bit funny 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.000
 embarrassing happened to me when 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.530
 people of you must have been watching her 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.210
 have seen the well and that it was 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.769
 The following were the poker table behind the 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.020
 played was just such an area 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.369
 So almost everyone was standing around where the 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.880
 Loser on so easily interviewed 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.530
 will be etc 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.530
 there were two on one side 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.150
 sofas on the back is behind kelly 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.350
 the blog that moderates everything 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.180
 and suddenly there was another 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.740
 Hundreds of people cancel the break 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.299
 players can go to the toilet and 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.909
 ask and what do I know I was sitting 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.860
 calmly on my sofa until 46 so 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.420
 to get two employees yes here 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.159
 agree on the couch on which you sit 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.720
 they we have to stand behind me so 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.490
 a tv and a tripod and the 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.350
 they wanted to turn around and needed them 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.030
 the spacey we have to a coach like that 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.799
 So I have a short lead 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.659
 for the time where my couch around devices 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.340
 on the length of the coach law the before 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.110
 So it was me again the form is 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.619
 the only way is to agree kelly because of 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.399
 Employees who stood behind 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.330
 additionally back to the checkout streeps 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.770
 seconds over 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.119
 funny like those of my coaching government 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.380
 the employees are currently in 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.310
 wanted to take care of this window my 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.100
 account tension whether suddenly 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.720
 Rogers disappeared the live shows 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.369
 Just keep going and kelly started 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.680
 modeling and I still say totally 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.119
 awkward on this fucking life of 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.369
 This couch with the back to the camera 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.399
 changed what I should do meant 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.090
 kelly so what what is that here is 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.550
 because go here 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.470

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.060
 asked and mostly babble microphone 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.590
 and that was all live was already rather 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.000
 funny you can even do that 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.709

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.820
