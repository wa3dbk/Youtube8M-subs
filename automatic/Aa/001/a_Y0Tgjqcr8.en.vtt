known as a dark heart so what I'm going

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.930 
known as a dark heart so what I'm going
to<00:00:44.150> do<00:00:44.270> is<00:00:45.640> fortunately<00:00:46.640> there<00:00:46.790> have

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
to do is fortunately there have

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.820 
to do is fortunately there have
incredibly<00:00:47.630> strong<00:00:47.720> roots<00:00:48.320> and<00:00:48.560> they<00:00:48.650> also

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:48.830 
incredibly strong roots and they also

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.670 
incredibly strong roots and they also
will<00:00:49.160> grow<00:00:49.400> from<00:00:49.790> their<00:00:50.060> stems<00:00:50.530> simply<00:00:51.530> by

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
will grow from their stems simply by

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.190 
will grow from their stems simply by
cutting<00:00:51.920> at<00:00:52.130> an<00:00:52.220> angle<00:00:52.660> which<00:00:53.660> I<00:00:53.780> will<00:00:53.930> do<00:00:54.020> in<00:00:54.140> a

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
cutting at an angle which I will do in a

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.990 
cutting at an angle which I will do in a
moment<00:00:54.320> I<00:00:54.590> will<00:00:54.650> cut<00:00:54.860> an<00:00:54.950> angle<00:00:55.130> so<00:00:55.730> that<00:00:55.760> it

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
moment I will cut an angle so that it

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.240 
moment I will cut an angle so that it
knows<00:00:56.510> it's<00:00:56.840> supposed<00:00:56.930> to<00:00:57.140> grow<00:00:57.380> basically

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
knows it's supposed to grow basically

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.830 
knows it's supposed to grow basically
need<00:00:58.430> about<00:00:58.610> four<00:00:58.910> inches<00:01:01.030> of<00:01:02.030> growing<00:01:02.510> space

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
need about four inches of growing space

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.980 
need about four inches of growing space
so<00:01:03.230> you<00:01:03.920> have<00:01:04.129> to<00:01:04.220> trim<00:01:04.460> some<00:01:04.730> of<00:01:04.760> the<00:01:04.990> leaves

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
so you have to trim some of the leaves

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.720 
so you have to trim some of the leaves
off<00:01:06.260> to<00:01:06.470> get<00:01:06.590> as<00:01:06.680> much<00:01:06.920> space<00:01:07.190> as<00:01:07.250> you<00:01:07.490> want

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:07.730 
off to get as much space as you want

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.900 
off to get as much space as you want
this<00:01:07.970> is<00:01:08.120> about<00:01:08.420> exactly<00:01:08.990> four<00:01:09.230> inches<00:01:09.470> tall

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:09.910 
this is about exactly four inches tall

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.380 
this is about exactly four inches tall
so<00:01:10.910> I'm<00:01:11.870> going<00:01:12.050> to<00:01:12.110> basically<00:01:12.260> put<00:01:12.800> it<00:01:12.980> about

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
so I'm going to basically put it about

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.020 
so I'm going to basically put it about
this<00:01:14.390> far<00:01:14.630> down<00:01:16.780> the<00:01:17.780> first<00:01:18.080> thing<00:01:18.260> you<00:01:18.350> need

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
this far down the first thing you need

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.880 
this far down the first thing you need
means<00:01:20.030> a<00:01:20.270> potting<00:01:20.990> soil

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.010 

like<00:01:24.890> this<00:01:25.180> this<00:01:26.180> is<00:01:26.330> just<00:01:26.450> dollar<00:01:26.720> tree

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
like this this is just dollar tree

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.960 
like this this is just dollar tree
potting<00:01:27.380> soil<00:01:27.620> yes<00:01:27.860> Dollar<00:01:28.130> Tree<00:01:28.220> has<00:01:28.520> potting

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
potting soil yes Dollar Tree has potting

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.170 
potting soil yes Dollar Tree has potting
soil<00:01:29.210> bleep<00:01:29.420> or<00:01:29.570> not<00:01:30.580> you<00:01:31.580> just<00:01:31.790> kind<00:01:32.000> of<00:01:32.060> get

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
soil bleep or not you just kind of get

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.140 
soil bleep or not you just kind of get
that<00:01:32.300> in<00:01:32.480> there<00:01:33.250> and<00:01:34.250> then<00:01:34.400> you<00:01:34.820> want<00:01:34.970> to<00:01:35.000> get<00:01:35.120> a

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
that in there and then you want to get a

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.030 
that in there and then you want to get a
watering<00:01:35.570> can<00:01:35.600> which<00:01:35.960> I'm<00:01:36.080> going<00:01:36.170> to<00:01:36.230> do

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.080 

okay<00:01:40.040> we're<00:01:40.190> basically<00:01:40.430> just<00:01:40.730> going<00:01:40.850> to<00:01:40.940> take

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
okay we're basically just going to take

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.290 
okay we're basically just going to take
the<00:01:41.210> root<00:01:41.470> or<00:01:42.470> the<00:01:42.590> base<00:01:42.940> we're<00:01:43.940> going<00:01:43.970> to<00:01:44.120> cut

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
the root or the base we're going to cut

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.850 
the root or the base we're going to cut
an<00:01:44.390> angle<00:01:44.540> like<00:01:44.810> this<00:01:46.030> so<00:01:47.030> that<00:01:47.060> it's<00:01:47.800> at<00:01:48.800> a

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
an angle like this so that it's at a

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.740 
an angle like this so that it's at a
point<00:01:50.530> and<00:01:51.530> then<00:01:51.710> all<00:01:51.800> you're<00:01:51.920> going<00:01:52.010> to<00:01:52.070> do<00:01:52.750> is

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
point and then all you're going to do is

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.650 
point and then all you're going to do is
you're<00:01:53.840> going<00:01:53.930> to<00:01:53.990> put<00:01:54.200> it<00:01:54.320> in<00:01:54.440> here<00:01:55.480> this<00:01:56.480> is<00:01:56.630> a

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
you're going to put it in here this is a

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.500 
you're going to put it in here this is a
little<00:01:56.900> tricky<00:01:57.700> but<00:01:58.700> you<00:01:58.850> basically<00:01:58.970> put<00:01:59.420> it

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
little tricky but you basically put it

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.990 
little tricky but you basically put it
in<00:01:59.630> here<00:02:00.280> I'm<00:02:01.280> going<00:02:01.460> to<00:02:01.520> pack<00:02:01.760> the<00:02:02.000> dirt<00:02:04.000> in

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
in here I'm going to pack the dirt in

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.790 
in here I'm going to pack the dirt in
over<00:02:05.960> we're<00:02:06.650> still<00:02:06.860> leaking<00:02:07.160> some<00:02:07.340> water<00:02:07.550> and

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
over we're still leaking some water and

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:16.210 
over we're still leaking some water and
over<00:02:09.800> there<00:02:10.690> so<00:02:11.690> that<00:02:11.840> it's<00:02:11.990> standing<00:02:12.350> up<00:02:15.220> just

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
over there so that it's standing up just

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.430 
over there so that it's standing up just
like<00:02:16.400> so<00:02:17.350> she's<00:02:18.350> just<00:02:18.380> barely<00:02:19.070> over<00:02:19.550> it<00:02:19.670> so<00:02:20.440> I'm

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
like so she's just barely over it so I'm

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.840 
like so she's just barely over it so I'm
actually<00:02:21.470> gonna<00:02:21.890> throw<00:02:22.070> a<00:02:22.100> little<00:02:22.220> dry<00:02:22.490> soil

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
actually gonna throw a little dry soil

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.520 
actually gonna throw a little dry soil
this<00:02:23.270> is<00:02:23.450> definitely<00:02:23.840> wet<00:02:24.080> enough<00:02:24.320> at<00:02:24.440> the

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
this is definitely wet enough at the

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.240 
this is definitely wet enough at the
base<00:02:25.330> just<00:02:26.330> so<00:02:26.480> it<00:02:26.630> has<00:02:26.780> some<00:02:26.960> support<00:02:27.250> and

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
base just so it has some support and

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.990 
base just so it has some support and
you're<00:02:28.970> going<00:02:29.090> to<00:02:29.150> put<00:02:29.360> it<00:02:29.500> where<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:31.489> Sun<00:02:31.760> can

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
you're going to put it where the Sun can

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.030 
you're going to put it where the Sun can
get<00:02:32.180> to<00:02:32.360> it<00:02:35.020> now<00:02:36.020> this<00:02:36.200> was<00:02:36.380> an<00:02:36.500> unintentional

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
get to it now this was an unintentional

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.979 
get to it now this was an unintentional
clipping<00:02:37.970> I<00:02:38.060> normally<00:02:38.390> wouldn't<00:02:38.570> do<00:02:38.780> this<00:02:38.930> to

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
clipping I normally wouldn't do this to

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:45.220 
clipping I normally wouldn't do this to
a<00:02:39.200> plant<00:02:39.770> this<00:02:39.980> uh<00:02:40.330> this<00:02:41.330> young<00:02:42.760> but<00:02:43.989> just<00:02:44.989> push

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
a plant this uh this young but just push

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.770 
a plant this uh this young but just push
down<00:02:45.260> where<00:02:46.070> where<00:02:46.580> the<00:02:46.730> stem<00:02:47.180> reaches<00:02:47.600> the

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
down where where the stem reaches the

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.710 
down where where the stem reaches the
ground<00:02:48.459> with<00:02:49.459> your<00:02:49.580> thumbs<00:02:49.880> and<00:02:50.180> that<00:02:50.630> will

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
ground with your thumbs and that will

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.540 
ground with your thumbs and that will
still<00:02:51.050> firm<00:02:51.380> up<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.650> dirt<00:02:51.860> around<00:02:52.010> it<00:02:52.250> so<00:02:52.430> it

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
still firm up the dirt around it so it

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.050 
still firm up the dirt around it so it
stands<00:02:52.820> up<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:53.750> then

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.520 

I'm<00:02:56.569> going<00:02:56.720> to<00:02:56.780> take<00:02:56.930> that<00:02:57.110> and<00:02:57.230> put<00:02:57.349> it<00:02:57.440> in

I'm going to take that and put it in

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:58.780 
I'm going to take that and put it in
direct<00:02:57.770> sunlight<00:02:58.010> where<00:02:58.280> you<00:02:58.340> can<00:02:58.430> get<00:02:58.550> lots

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
direct sunlight where you can get lots

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.570 
direct sunlight where you can get lots
of<00:02:59.150> light<00:02:59.390> and<00:02:59.770> it'll<00:03:00.770> start<00:03:01.010> growing<00:03:01.130> on<00:03:01.430> its

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
of light and it'll start growing on its

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:12.790 
of light and it'll start growing on its
own<00:03:01.700> again<00:03:01.940> and<00:03:02.330> that's<00:03:02.480> it
