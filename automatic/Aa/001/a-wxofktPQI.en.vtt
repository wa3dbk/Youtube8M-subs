00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
towards the front of the bike then you

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.920 
towards the front of the bike then you
could<00:00:50.670> probably<00:00:50.910> go<00:00:51.180> ahead<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.480> lower<00:00:51.809> it

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
could probably go ahead and lower it

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.260 
could probably go ahead and lower it

then<00:00:57.870> obviously<00:00:58.199> you're<00:00:58.680> gonna<00:00:58.980> change<00:00:59.280> the

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
then obviously you're gonna change the

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.029 
then obviously you're gonna change the
swing<00:00:59.969> arm<00:01:00.149> angle<00:01:00.719> as<00:01:01.199> you're<00:01:01.379> going<00:01:01.559> for<00:01:01.829> last

swing arm angle as you're going for last

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.750 
swing arm angle as you're going for last
it's<00:01:02.489> for<00:01:02.789> faster<00:01:03.480> lap<00:01:03.750> times<00:01:04.080> excuse<00:01:04.619> me<00:01:04.769> then

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
it's for faster lap times excuse me then

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.820 
it's for faster lap times excuse me then

an accelerate away from the corner it's

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.490 
an accelerate away from the corner it's
clearly<00:01:14.729> critical<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.509> faster<00:01:15.900> lap<00:01:16.049> times<00:01:16.320> and

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
clearly critical to faster lap times and

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.940 
clearly critical to faster lap times and

swing<00:01:48.420> arm<00:01:48.540> will<00:01:48.720> go<00:01:48.869> flat<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.590> therefore<00:01:49.920> the

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
swing arm will go flat and therefore the

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.020 
swing arm will go flat and therefore the
tire<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:50.670> more<00:01:50.970> likely<00:01:51.799> to<00:01:52.799> spin<00:01:53.250> depending<00:01:53.880> on

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
tire is more likely to spin depending on

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.850 
tire is more likely to spin depending on
how<00:01:54.450> aggressive<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:55.229> are<00:01:55.259> with<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.619> throttle

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
how aggressive you are with the throttle

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.859 
how aggressive you are with the throttle
if<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.759> tire<00:01:56.969> spinning<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.659> don't

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
if the tire spinning and you don't

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.420 
if the tire spinning and you don't
control<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.320> properly<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.829> then<00:01:58.890> obviously

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
control it properly and then obviously

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.920 
control it properly and then obviously
out<00:01:59.759> comes<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.360> frequent<00:02:00.810> flyer<00:02:01.079> card

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
out comes the frequent flyer card

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.630 
out comes the frequent flyer card
you're<00:02:02.170> off<00:02:02.350> the<00:02:02.530> high<00:02:02.680> side<00:02:02.980> and<00:02:03.010> we<00:02:03.370> want<00:02:03.460> to

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
you're off the high side and we want to

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.560 
you're off the high side and we want to
avoid<00:02:04.000> that<00:02:04.330> at<00:02:04.900> all<00:02:05.080> possible<00:02:05.590> cost<00:02:05.890> so<00:02:06.570> what

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
avoid that at all possible cost so what

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.529 
avoid that at all possible cost so what
I<00:02:07.600> would<00:02:07.750> suggest<00:02:07.990> is<00:02:08.380> this<00:02:08.970> go<00:02:09.970> ahead<00:02:10.090> and

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
I would suggest is this go ahead and

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:11.850 
I would suggest is this go ahead and
ride<00:02:10.929> the<00:02:11.080> bike<00:02:11.260> in<00:02:11.440> its<00:02:11.590> current

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
ride the bike in its current

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.420 
ride the bike in its current
configuration<00:02:12.510> then<00:02:13.510> each<00:02:14.050> session<00:02:14.620> reduce

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
configuration then each session reduce

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.840 
configuration then each session reduce
your<00:02:15.640> ride<00:02:15.880> height<00:02:16.180> on<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.690> shock<00:02:17.100> by<00:02:18.100> turning

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
your ride height on the shock by turning

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.970 
your ride height on the shock by turning
half<00:02:19.240> a<00:02:19.540> turn<00:02:19.900> to<00:02:20.230> make<00:02:20.320> the<00:02:20.380> shock<00:02:20.709> lower

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
half a turn to make the shock lower

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.160 
half a turn to make the shock lower
which<00:02:21.310> would<00:02:21.610> if<00:02:21.880> you're<00:02:22.180> adjusting<00:02:22.570> a<00:02:22.870> shark

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
which would if you're adjusting a shark

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.510 
which would if you're adjusting a shark
facing<00:02:23.830> it<00:02:24.040> be<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:24.910> clockwise<00:02:25.420> direction<00:02:26.520> you

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
facing it be a clockwise direction you

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.880 
facing it be a clockwise direction you
need<00:02:27.790> to<00:02:27.970> sit<00:02:28.330> set<00:02:28.750> up<00:02:28.900> a<00:02:28.990> series<00:02:29.260> of<00:02:29.410> corners

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
need to sit set up a series of corners

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.310 
need to sit set up a series of corners
where<00:02:30.430> you<00:02:30.580> have<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:30.940> same<00:02:31.150> entry<00:02:31.510> speed<00:02:31.870> the

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
point in terms of where you pick the

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.610 
point in terms of where you pick the
throttle<00:02:39.940> up<00:02:40.030> and<00:02:40.300> you'll<00:02:40.810> roll<00:02:41.110> on<00:02:41.350> for

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
throttle up and you'll roll on for

you remove yourself and create yourself

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.740 
you remove yourself and create yourself
as<00:02:47.950> a<00:02:47.980> control<00:02:48.160> mechanism<00:02:48.640> to<00:02:49.239> see<00:02:49.450> what<00:02:49.630> the

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
as a control mechanism to see what the

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.650 
as a control mechanism to see what the
bike<00:02:49.900> is<00:02:50.110> doing<00:02:50.440> now<00:02:51.100> as<00:02:51.340> we<00:02:51.760> are<00:02:51.790> human<00:02:52.390> beings

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
bike is doing now as we are human beings

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.660 
bike is doing now as we are human beings
that<00:02:52.720> is<00:02:52.930> incredibly<00:02:53.650> difficult<00:02:53.830> to<00:02:54.250> do<00:02:54.430> so

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
that is incredibly difficult to do so

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.880 
that is incredibly difficult to do so
what<00:02:55.239> I<00:02:55.270> would<00:02:55.480> suggest<00:02:55.720> there<00:02:56.170> is<00:02:56.230> that<00:02:56.650> you

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
what I would suggest there is that you

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.270 
what I would suggest there is that you
pick<00:02:57.520> one<00:02:57.910> corner<00:02:58.480> to<00:02:58.600> focus<00:02:59.020> on<00:02:59.200> remember<00:03:00.190> at

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
pick one corner to focus on remember at

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.920 
pick one corner to focus on remember at
this<00:03:00.370> point<00:03:00.489> you're<00:03:00.820> testing<00:03:01.300> so<00:03:01.480> lap<00:03:01.630> times

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
this point you're testing so lap times

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.920 
this point you're testing so lap times
are<00:03:02.250> completely<00:03:03.250> irrelevant<00:03:03.790> and<00:03:04.510> what

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
are completely irrelevant and what

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.449 
are completely irrelevant and what
you're<00:03:05.050> trying<00:03:05.260> to<00:03:05.320> do<00:03:05.410> here<00:03:05.920> is<00:03:06.070> figure<00:03:06.400> out

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
you're trying to do here is figure out

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.670 
you're trying to do here is figure out
in<00:03:07.209> lowering<00:03:07.630> a<00:03:07.750> shark<00:03:08.019> do<00:03:08.290> you<00:03:08.410> lose<00:03:08.680> grip<00:03:09.360> so

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
in lowering a shark do you lose grip so

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.440 
in lowering a shark do you lose grip so
figure<00:03:11.680> out<00:03:11.739> how<00:03:12.040> that<00:03:12.370> will<00:03:12.670> best<00:03:12.880> work<00:03:13.180> for

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
figure out how that will best work for

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.240 
figure out how that will best work for
you<00:03:13.570> there's<00:03:13.959> a<00:03:14.019> protocol<00:03:14.530> for<00:03:14.860> you<00:03:14.950> to<00:03:15.070> follow
