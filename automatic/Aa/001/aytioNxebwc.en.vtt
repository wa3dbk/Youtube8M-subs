others attacked the biggest gt3 race in
the<00:01:14.270> world<00:01:14.420> I<00:01:14.690> think<00:01:15.020> for<00:01:15.200> them<00:01:15.409> it's<00:01:15.650> quite

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
the world I think for them it's quite

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.200 
the world I think for them it's quite
different<00:01:17.420> to<00:01:17.960> what<00:01:18.560> they're<00:01:18.800> used<00:01:19.070> to

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
different to what they're used to

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.540 
different to what they're used to
because<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:21.020> difference<00:01:21.440> between<00:01:21.680> an<00:01:22.220> LNP

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
because the difference between an LNP

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.960 
because the difference between an LNP
one<00:01:23.060> was<00:01:23.360> harboring<00:01:23.750> power<00:01:24.040> and<00:01:25.040> the<00:01:25.190> gt3<00:01:25.729> car

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
one was harboring power and the gt3 car

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:34.389 
one was harboring power and the gt3 car
for<00:01:26.540> sure<00:01:26.750> is<00:01:27.380> quite<00:01:27.920> important<00:01:33.039> but<00:01:34.039> I<00:01:34.160> think

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
for sure is quite important but I think

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:36.850 
for sure is quite important but I think
they<00:01:35.000> like<00:01:35.300> this<00:01:35.570> challenge<00:01:35.990> that's<00:01:36.470> why<00:01:36.679> they

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
they like this challenge that's why they

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:51.070 
they like this challenge that's why they
go<00:01:37.009> for<00:01:37.280> it

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.380 

and<00:01:52.080> each<00:01:52.350> face<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.920> goal<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.280> win<00:01:53.550> I<00:01:53.850> don't

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
and each face the goal is to win I don't

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.630 
and each face the goal is to win I don't
want<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.720> give<00:01:54.900> any<00:01:55.080> prognosis<00:01:55.380> but<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:56.340> deep

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
want to give any prognosis but it deep
