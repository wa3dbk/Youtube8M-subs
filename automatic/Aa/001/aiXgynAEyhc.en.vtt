I'm going over another loop back in the

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:58.850 
I'm going over another loop back in the
opposite<00:00:47.920> direction<00:00:55.470> and<00:00:56.470> cut<00:00:56.769> off<00:00:56.890> the<00:00:57.100> tail

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
opposite direction and cut off the tail

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.110 
opposite direction and cut off the tail
right<00:00:59.860> here<00:00:59.920> where<00:01:00.370> there's<00:01:00.519> a<00:01:00.579> couple<00:01:00.820> of

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:05.649 
tails together you can take and make a

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:09.290 
tails together you can take and make a
knot<00:01:06.000> like<00:01:07.000> that<00:01:07.330> you<00:01:08.320> do<00:01:08.470> want<00:01:08.649> to<00:01:08.740> make<00:01:08.979> sure
