and see if that works somebody told me
that<00:02:40.080> that<00:02:40.110> should<00:02:40.440> work<00:02:40.590> so<00:02:40.770> I'm<00:02:40.860> going<00:02:40.980> to

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.260 
good before I went rafting because it
started<00:03:01.220> kind<00:03:01.400> of<00:03:01.430> losing<00:03:01.700> its<00:03:01.819> shape<00:03:01.970> even

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
started kind of losing its shape even

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.090 
started kind of losing its shape even
before<00:03:02.450> that<00:03:02.650> so<00:03:03.650> so<00:03:04.520> far<00:03:04.730> so<00:03:05.090> good<00:03:05.120> on<00:03:05.599> the<00:03:05.720> Hat

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100
