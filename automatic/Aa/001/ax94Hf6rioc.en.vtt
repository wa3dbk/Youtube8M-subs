00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
that it's got pretty good protection so

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.250 
that it's got pretty good protection so
it's<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:23.970> soft<00:00:24.210> rubber<00:00:24.480> material<00:00:25.080> on<00:00:25.170> the

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260

inside<00:00:25.380> hard<00:00:25.920> plastic<00:00:26.400> on<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.609> outside<00:00:26.670> and

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
inside hard plastic on the outside and

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.240 
inside hard plastic on the outside and
then<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.599> soft<00:00:27.900> rubber<00:00:28.289> comes<00:00:28.680> up<00:00:28.890> around

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
then that soft rubber comes up around

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.299 
then that soft rubber comes up around
the<00:00:29.820> edges<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.510> creates<00:00:31.260> this<00:00:31.500> nice<00:00:31.830> grip

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
the edges and creates this nice grip

the edges and creates this nice grip
that's<00:00:32.610> really<00:00:32.910> going<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.059> prevent<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.570> from

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
that's really going to prevent it from

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.720 
that's really going to prevent it from
slipping<00:00:34.530> out<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:34.950> your<00:00:35.100> hand

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
material so that's gonna work well as

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.120

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
far as screen protectors go with this it

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.920 
far as screen protectors go with this it
does<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.490> lip<00:01:11.700> does<00:01:11.939> come<00:01:12.210> up<00:01:12.240> over<00:01:12.689> quite<00:01:12.900> a

does that lip does come up over quite a

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.020 
does that lip does come up over quite a
bit<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:14.010> it's<00:01:14.130> not<00:01:14.250> gonna<00:01:14.430> work<00:01:14.610> with<00:01:14.820> all

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
bit so it's not gonna work with all

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.670 
bit so it's not gonna work with all
screen<00:01:15.420> protectors<00:01:15.930> if<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.170> have<00:01:16.290> questions
