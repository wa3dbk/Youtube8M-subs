ideas<00:02:05.450> because<00:02:05.509> in<00:02:06.170> honest<00:02:06.619> i'm<00:02:06.740> making<00:02:07.490> this

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
ideas because in honest i'm making this

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.430 
ideas because in honest i'm making this
because<00:02:07.909> I<00:02:08.000> want<00:02:08.030> my<00:02:08.269> constella<00:02:08.810> deck<00:02:09.109> to<00:02:09.289> be

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
because I want my constella deck to be

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.479 
because I want my constella deck to be
like<00:02:09.709> the<00:02:09.890> best<00:02:10.130> no<00:02:10.399> one<00:02:10.549> has<00:02:10.670> ever<00:02:10.820> seen<00:02:10.970> now

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.610 
like the best no one has ever seen now
so<00:02:13.489> far<00:02:13.790> two<00:02:14.269> cards<00:02:14.750> that<00:02:14.900> I've<00:02:15.049> been<00:02:15.200> testing

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
so far two cards that I've been testing

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.710 
so far two cards that I've been testing
in<00:02:15.709> my<00:02:15.799> dad<00:02:15.980> protecting<00:02:16.549> Pleiades<00:02:17.030> better

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
in my dad protecting Pleiades better

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.430 
in my dad protecting Pleiades better
than<00:02:17.930> anything<00:02:18.230> else<00:02:18.410> is<00:02:19.180> safe<00:02:20.180> zone<00:02:20.540> like<00:02:21.410> you

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
than anything else is safe zone like you

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.160 
than anything else is safe zone like you
see<00:02:21.680> safe<00:02:21.920> zone<00:02:22.160> safe<00:02:22.760> zone<00:02:22.970> has<00:02:23.180> is<00:02:23.420> you<00:02:24.019> know

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
see safe zone safe zone has is you know

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.289 
see safe zone safe zone has is you know
its<00:02:24.440> ups<00:02:24.799> and<00:02:24.980> downs<00:02:25.070> because<00:02:25.489> it<00:02:26.030> can't

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
its ups and downs because it can't

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.140 
its ups and downs because it can't
attack<00:02:26.389> directly<00:02:27.049> and<00:02:27.440> it<00:02:27.590> can<00:02:27.709> easily

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
attack directly and it can easily

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.970 
attack directly and it can easily
you<00:02:28.540> know<00:02:28.659> destroy<00:02:28.930> your<00:02:29.110> monster<00:02:29.290> with<00:02:29.769> you

you know destroy your monster with you
know<00:02:30.069> an<00:02:30.220> MST<00:02:30.700> but<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.599> only<00:02:31.750> good<00:02:31.930> thing<00:02:31.959> is

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
know an MST but the only good thing is

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.509 
know an MST but the only good thing is
with<00:02:32.439> something<00:02:32.680> like<00:02:32.769> m7<00:02:33.220> you<00:02:33.310> could<00:02:33.430> just

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
with something like m7 you could just

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:34.800 
with something like m7 you could just
put<00:02:33.700> it<00:02:33.790> right<00:02:33.819> on<00:02:34.030> top<00:02:34.209> of<00:02:34.269> play<00:02:34.480> these<00:02:34.629> are

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
put it right on top of play these are

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.270 
put it right on top of play these are
putting<00:02:35.049> it<00:02:35.110> on<00:02:35.200> top<00:02:35.379> of<00:02:35.439> any<00:02:35.680> other<00:02:35.860> constella

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
putting it on top of any other constella

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.240 
putting it on top of any other constella
card<00:02:36.579> and<00:02:36.849> pretty<00:02:37.450> much<00:02:37.510> bring<00:02:37.930> out<00:02:38.260> m7<00:02:39.069> as

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
card and pretty much bring out m7 as

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.420 
card and pretty much bring out m7 as
long<00:02:39.730> as<00:02:39.879> it's<00:02:40.030> an<00:02:40.120> XYZ<00:02:40.569> constellar<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.470> I

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
long as it's an XYZ constellar and I

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.130 
long as it's an XYZ constellar and I
like<00:02:43.000> that<00:02:43.180> because<00:02:43.329> you<00:02:43.569> know<00:02:43.599> any<00:02:43.870> time<00:02:44.019> of

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
like that because you know any time of

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.390 
like that because you know any time of
your<00:02:44.230> opponent<00:02:44.560> thinks<00:02:44.650> he's<00:02:44.890> gonna<00:02:45.010> you<00:02:45.310> know

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
your opponent thinks he's gonna you know

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.710 
destroy Pleiades or any of my kinsella
cause<00:02:47.769> I<00:02:47.950> was<00:02:48.129> just<00:02:48.310> like<00:02:48.459> it<00:02:48.760> saves<00:02:49.390> them<00:02:49.659> from

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
cause I was just like it saves them from

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.220

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
that inch of destruction and I always

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.259 
that inch of destruction and I always
found<00:02:53.560> that<00:02:53.769> to<00:02:53.829> be<00:02:53.920> good<00:02:54.250> I'm<00:02:54.489> been<00:02:54.909> testing

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
found that to be good I'm been testing

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.420 
found that to be good I'm been testing
one<00:02:55.480> testing<00:02:55.689> to<00:02:56.079> I'm<00:02:56.409> kind<00:02:56.739> of<00:02:56.829> iffy<00:02:57.099> with<00:02:57.280> it

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
one testing to I'm kind of iffy with it

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.490
