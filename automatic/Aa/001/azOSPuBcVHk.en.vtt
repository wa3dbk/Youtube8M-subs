00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
the osseous crests right here so we have

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.760 
the osseous crests right here so we have
two<00:01:10.590> options<00:01:10.830> we<00:01:11.159> can<00:01:11.189> either<00:01:12.409> crown<00:01:13.409> lengthen

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770

a crown leaking from here we can either

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.870 
a crown leaking from here we can either
re<00:01:15.420> crank<00:01:15.930> them<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.650> gain<00:01:17.009> more<00:01:17.189> tooth<00:01:17.520> for

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.590 
so just to prevent the provisional from
fracturing<00:01:53.940> so<00:01:54.120> this<00:01:54.240> is<00:01:54.360> what<00:01:54.510> the

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
fracturing so this is what the

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.280 
fracturing so this is what the
provisional<00:01:55.080> looks<00:01:55.260> like<00:01:55.470> for<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.640> canine<00:01:57.290> so

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
provisional looks like for the canine so

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.859 
provisional looks like for the canine so
we're<00:01:58.440> going<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.619> do<00:01:58.800> is<00:01:59.070> now<00:01:59.940> I'm<00:02:00.660> going<00:02:00.810> to

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
it's self adhesive so it means that we

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.880 
it's self adhesive so it means that we
don't<00:02:17.760> have<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.060> actually<00:02:18.239> talk<00:02:18.630> to<00:02:18.660> bond<00:02:19.050> so
