00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.259
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:14.340
 I am an artic and today I would like you 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:20.300
 show my foot homemade this ford 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:24.119
 pickup somewhere in the mid 90s 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:29.460
 I also ran a little ahead, I think 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:34.350
 where is the end of the 80s so but its me 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:38.670
 collected so let's say for a long time 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:42.870
 because as he is massive in himself 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:46.440
 and the details it took me so let's say 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:51.090
 a bit much but if of course someone wants 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:53.129
 so I recorded the tutorial as his 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.730
 of course you can write 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.039
 comments I will try to shoot 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.430
 tutorial 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:05.700
 that is , it was difficult to collect it 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:12.540
 sense of what to think 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:17.720
 his equipment but perhaps we start here 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:20.810
 So given this looks homemade 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:30.540
 here's the side 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:35.670
 design is such a black blue so 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:41.340
 Looks like the front here. 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:45.540
 massive grille here we have 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:49.200
 there is a big v-shaped engine 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.659
 on all pickups from ford principle now 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:57.590
 I'll try to pull it out and show it. 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:02:01.490
 separately so 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:07.970
 here is the engine itself 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:10.709
 so here it all looks like this engine 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:15.000
 principle for this homemade he 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:19.590
 big enough but I somehow managed it 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:24.500
 put here to be more beautiful 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:26.720
 looked like so let's say here we have such 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:31.170
 hood valves 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:41.100
 so here we open the door 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:45.440
 Naturally there are such wheels so here at 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:48.690
 this model is present such 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:52.430
 massive enough trunk that is 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:56.100
 here you can put a lot of things 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:59.010
 let's say he is such a log of the court very 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:08.730
 just fit in or say it from 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:11.010
 shotguns so from behind it also looks like 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.940
 all ford pickup 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:17.340
 here are the dimensions 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:22.829
 here is a small stand so that 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:27.680
 it was possible to get here but here I am 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:31.230
 of course did this pickup so let's say with 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:35.790
 the law on the mouth course and so i have 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:41.100
 here here are the silencers stranglers i 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:45.650
 did they just made from here such 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:52.109
 here are the binoculars and their just court enough 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:57.560
 so he put so the bottom construction 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:04:00.269
 not so simple but still 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:06.310
 over this design of course had 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:12.720
 think how to do it in general but 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:16.900
 I found a way out of this situation 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:23.800
 Now consider the salon now I'm all 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:26.100
 clean it up so it looks like this 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.620
 Salon I mean 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:34.570
 space is nenko and just that is here 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:37.389
 us glove box is here speedometer here 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.520
 here is such a gear lever and 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:44.290
 steering wheel 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:50.530
 everything in blue is such a strong salon 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:54.400
 so let's say a little exotics given 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:58.860
 the model can put two 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:00.070
 minifigurki now show it 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:05.680
 here 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:10.169
 1 minifigure so let's put it behind the wheel 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.169
 and 2 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:17.950
 but of course the only drawback of this 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:23.830
 models that need to plant a minifigure 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:26.590
 one that's the way it is, but the sides 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:33.039
 still it all looks i think 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:41.229
 pretty good here and so all this 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:46.840
 looks like and as I said the trunk 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:50.110
 This model has a trunk 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:53.320
 this model is very roomy that is 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:56.100
 he can also put himself two 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:59.789
 minifigures or even three 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:03.000
 that is, you can also put 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:07.169
 all sorts of accessories 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:11.680
 type of such a log can mount 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:14.800
 well, it's basically still going to repeat 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.760
 if you want me to release a tutorial 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.190
 by this myself 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:21.550
 finishes of course write in the comments 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:24.490
 I will try to make it advise 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:29.820
 subscribe to my channel like 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:33.880
 under the video and of course I 'm sorry that I 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:38.160
 so let's say for a long time did not release the video to everyone 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.160
 thanks for watching everyone bye
