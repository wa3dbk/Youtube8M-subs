 net boat forgiveness let's perform what 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.850
 who talked to Oscar Díaz with this 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.850
 referring to national handball 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.320
 is the maximum reference of the red of the 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.750
 handball one of the best players to 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.820
 International champion of Europe 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.399
 with Barcelona he has played in the league 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.379
 asobal de españa ' with the veszprém in 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.660
 hungary and currently the mend in of the 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.610
 germany bundesliga strut with the 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.979
 selection that this year participated in the 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.989
 qatar world cup for the third time 

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:49.500
 consecutive is present on a date 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.420
 planetary the objectives are others in 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.339
 soon they will seek to reach the gold medal 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.489
 to the Olympic date of river to the rematch 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:58.920
 of Guadalajara is paramount 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.010
 course there is a 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.719
 a feeling of revenge I think that 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.040
 we have to prove to ourselves first that 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.600
 nothing ourselves that we are 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.040
 able to improve that we are capable of 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.450
 get what we want and that's what 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.520
 let's go to toronto 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.520
 I think we have evolved we see 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.200
 managed to get a little closer to the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.540
 candidates to be champions 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.770
 Pan American but we still have in 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.490
 realize that as we have 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.020
 improved they also have to go to 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.080
 fight the tournament with the greatest humility 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.000
 possible the passage through Qatar was a point 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.940
 of inflection so that the establishment 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.600
 grow professionally us 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.400
 we are clear that Qatar was one more step 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.050
 to get to this 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.920
 we were clear that there were seven or eight 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:52.740
 players who premiered in this type 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.560
 of international competitions and me 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.300
 I think obviously we kept the same 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.720
 classification that we have achieved 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.220
 last two world but we stayed 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.370
 with pleasure less we do not think that 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.070
 we could have been better shared 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.250
 how he was with slovenia or how with 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.650
 Brazil or the match with Iran will also not 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.049
 we were 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.409
 the serious ones in the serious ones necessary for 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:20.750
 be able to fight for the positions plus a 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:22.849
 little bit later his season in the 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.799
 Maitén had some setbacks 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:27.519
 pressures had it between cottons 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:29.720
 but he was able to leave with his team 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.849
 good one a season ago a little 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.909
 complicated by the issue of nations 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:36.799
 this year I had a subluxation of 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:40.760
 shoulder that has kept me almost two 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:43.010
 months out then I went back directly two 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.489
 weeks later I came with the selection 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:50.120
 and I finished in a month playing 15 games 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:55.740
 with three trips between europe and 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:57.960
 South America and a half of Emirates 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.690
 which led me to have another injury 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.690
 muscle in the twin is a break in 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.360
 a vein which kept me again a 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.580
 bit a bit removed then there was no 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.380
 a continuity for that part frame 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.690
 Oneto is the most experienced player 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.730
 of the team the withdrawal option does not 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.430
 scares now wants to take advantage of their 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.500
 last years of career enjoying in 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.710
 The best league of the world 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.720
 next season the key or as a 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.930
 season to enjoy 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.800
 one of the few that I'm staying and 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.500
 I'm trying our season 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.720
 last enjoying each each game that 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.300
 I have in the bundesliga that at last and 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.800
 is the best league in the world are 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.960
 matches to which we go to full stadium 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.670
 in all places 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.310
 and that is something that I will not be able to return 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.950
 to enjoy when I retire frame oneto 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.200
 the emblematic Chilean handball that 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:53.450
 wants to leave the red on the highest 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.450
 of the podium in Toronto 2015
