00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
here it is right here now there's a

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.109

bunch of different settings and you can
set<00:00:21.449> them<00:00:21.539> up<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.689> be<00:00:22.380> in<00:00:22.590> any<00:00:22.800> kind<00:00:23.100> of

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
set them up to be in any kind of

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.250 
set them up to be in any kind of
combination<00:00:23.519> you<00:00:23.970> want<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:24.869> literally

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
combination you want so I literally

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.380 
combination you want so I literally
can't<00:00:25.830> show<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:26.220> every<00:00:26.730> single<00:00:26.970> combination

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
can't show you every single combination

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.050 
can't show you every single combination
because<00:00:27.810> this<00:00:28.050> would<00:00:28.170> probably<00:00:28.289> be<00:00:28.470> like<00:00:28.710> a

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
because this would probably be like a

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.099 
because this would probably be like a
10-15<00:00:30.060> minute<00:00:30.090> video<00:00:30.570> just<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:30.900> show<00:00:30.960> you

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
10-15 minute video just to show you

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.770 
10-15 minute video just to show you
every<00:00:31.500> combination<00:00:32.420> so<00:00:33.420> I'm<00:00:33.510> just<00:00:33.600> going<00:00:33.719> to

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
every combination so I'm just going to

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.819 
every combination so I'm just going to
go<00:00:33.870> through<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.110> list<00:00:34.200> here<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.559> guys<00:00:34.649> will

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
go through the list here you guys will

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.440 
go through the list here you guys will
get<00:00:34.920> an<00:00:35.040> idea<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.370> how<00:00:35.880> this<00:00:36.000> works<00:00:36.210> basically

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
get an idea of how this works basically

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.490 
get an idea of how this works basically
so<00:00:37.380> first<00:00:37.620> we<00:00:37.800> have<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.840> banner<00:00:39.840> animations

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
so first we have the banner animations

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.260 
so first we have the banner animations
which<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.890> different<00:00:41.190> slides<00:00:41.700> here<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.180> you

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
which is different slides here so you

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.930 
which is different slides here so you
can<00:00:42.440> slide<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.739> banner<00:00:44.160> notification<00:00:44.820> and

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
can slide the banner notification and

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.170 
can slide the banner notification and
from<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.510> left<00:00:45.780> just<00:00:46.710> like<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:46.969> so<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.059> can

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
from the left just like that so you can

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.819 
from the left just like that so you can
do<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.480> show<00:00:48.719> test<00:00:48.960> button<00:00:49.200> at<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.620> bottom

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
do the show test button at the bottom

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.610 
do the show test button at the bottom
right<00:00:50.010> there<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.370> test<00:00:50.610> all<00:00:50.789> these<00:00:50.910> out<00:00:51.059> as<00:00:51.239> you

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
right there to test all these out as you

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.840 
right there to test all these out as you
basically<00:00:52.620> change<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.430> way<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.579> like

is zoom in now keep in mind i have slide
from<00:01:45.899> bottom<00:01:46.229> fade<00:01:46.530> in<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.770> then<00:01:47.130> zoom<00:01:47.579> in<00:01:47.790> all

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
from bottom fade in and then zoom in all

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.420 
from bottom fade in and then zoom in all
on<00:01:48.329> as<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:49.259> can<00:01:49.409> see<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.740> could<00:01:49.920> switch<00:01:50.220> these

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
on as you can see you could switch these

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.249 
on as you can see you could switch these
on<00:01:50.640> any<00:01:50.939> combination<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.570> can<00:01:51.780> think<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.079> and

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
on any combination you can think of and

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.060 
on any combination you can think of and
you're<00:01:52.350> going<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.530> get<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.649> different<00:01:52.829> result

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
you're going to get a different result

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.060 
you're going to get a different result
for<00:01:53.430> every<00:01:53.939> different<00:01:54.649> different<00:01:55.649> set<00:01:55.950> up

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
for every different different set up

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.830 
for every different different set up
basically<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:57.149> there's<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.329> lot<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.509> free<00:01:57.719> play

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
basically so there's a lot of free play

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.209 
basically so there's a lot of free play
with<00:01:58.020> this<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.320> get<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:59.009> banner

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
with this to get the the banner

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.069 
with this to get the the banner
animations<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.360> look<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.630> way<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.750> really

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
animations to look the way you really

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.130 
animations to look the way you really
like<00:02:01.229> them<00:02:01.439> so<00:02:02.070> here<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.490> zoom<00:02:03.119> in<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.420> fade<00:02:03.840> in

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
like them so here is zoom in a fade in

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.399 
like them so here is zoom in a fade in
and<00:02:04.380> then<00:02:05.040> slide<00:02:05.490> from<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.790> bottom<00:02:06.320> so<00:02:07.320> I'm

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
and then slide from the bottom so I'm

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.630 
and then slide from the bottom so I'm
gonna<00:02:07.530> go<00:02:07.680> ahead<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.950> I'm<00:02:08.220> going<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.429> actually

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
gonna go ahead and I'm going to actually

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.160 
gonna go ahead and I'm going to actually
switch<00:02:09.060> this<00:02:09.239> up<00:02:09.420> I'm<00:02:09.569> going<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.780> do<00:02:09.840> slide

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
switch this up I'm going to do slide

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.619 
switch this up I'm going to do slide
from<00:02:10.410> center<00:02:10.739> switch<00:02:11.160> that<00:02:11.370> off<00:02:11.450> I'm<00:02:12.450> going<00:02:12.569> to

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
from center switch that off I'm going to

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.200 
from center switch that off I'm going to
turn<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.870> fade-in<00:02:13.110> off

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
turn the fade-in off

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.190 
turn the fade-in off
and<00:02:15.210> then<00:02:15.390> I'm<00:02:15.630> going<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:15.810> switch<00:02:15.960> this<00:02:16.140> to

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
and then I'm going to switch this to

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.180 
and then I'm going to switch this to
zoom<00:02:16.680> out<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.100> snap<00:02:18.470> so<00:02:19.470> very<00:02:19.830> cool<00:02:20.070> looking

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
zoom out and snap so very cool looking

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.450 
zoom out and snap so very cool looking
right<00:02:20.460> there<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:20.940> then<00:02:21.660> here<00:02:21.930> is<00:02:22.050> fancy<00:02:22.530> you

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
right there and then here is fancy you

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.590 
right there and then here is fancy you
can<00:02:23.610> have<00:02:23.760> it<00:02:23.880> spin<00:02:25.880> so<00:02:26.880> it<00:02:27.030> came<00:02:27.180> in<00:02:27.330> from<00:02:27.510> the

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
can have it spin so it came in from the

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.970 
can have it spin so it came in from the
center<00:02:27.990> it<00:02:28.520> zoom<00:02:29.520> out<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:29.940> snapped<00:02:30.300> and<00:02:30.570> then

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
center it zoom out and snapped and then

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.570 
center it zoom out and snapped and then
did<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.100> spin<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.670> then<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.880> next<00:02:33.030> here<00:02:33.480> is<00:02:33.630> a

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
did the spin and then the next here is a

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.070 
did the spin and then the next here is a
infinite<00:02:35.580> spin<00:02:35.880> so<00:02:36.510> go<00:02:36.630> ahead<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:36.840> turn<00:02:36.930> that

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
infinite spin so go ahead and turn that

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.660 
infinite spin so go ahead and turn that
on<00:02:37.140> its<00:02:37.230> basically<00:02:37.680> just<00:02:37.890> going<00:02:38.070> to<00:02:38.130> spin<00:02:38.400> real

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
on its basically just going to spin real

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.880 
on its basically just going to spin real
slow<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.030> then<00:02:39.360> eventually<00:02:39.510> fade<00:02:40.050> out<00:02:40.200> which

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
slow and then eventually fade out which

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.410 
slow and then eventually fade out which
is<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.040> really<00:02:41.340> cool<00:02:41.490> looking<00:02:41.850> kind<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.120> effect

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
is a really cool looking kind of effect

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:49.370 
is a really cool looking kind of effect
as<00:02:42.600> well<00:02:45.620> so<00:02:46.620> that<00:02:46.800> is<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:47.030> infinite<00:02:48.030> spin<00:02:48.380> go

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
as well so that is a infinite spin go

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.600 
as well so that is a infinite spin go
ahead<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.650> switch<00:02:49.830> these<00:02:49.980> off<00:02:50.250> I'm<00:02:50.490> actually

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
ahead and switch these off I'm actually

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.440 
ahead and switch these off I'm actually
going<00:02:50.820> to<00:02:50.910> turn<00:02:51.420> zoom<00:02:51.960> out<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.470> snap<00:02:52.890> off<00:02:53.450> and

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
going to turn zoom out and snap off and

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.880 
going to turn zoom out and snap off and
I'm<00:02:54.540> going<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:54.690> turn<00:02:54.870> off<00:02:55.020> slide<00:02:55.500> up<00:02:55.650> from

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
I'm going to turn off slide up from

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.640 
I'm going to turn off slide up from
Center<00:02:56.780> I'm<00:02:57.780> going<00:02:57.960> to<00:02:58.020> go<00:02:58.080> ahead<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.380> turn<00:02:58.500> on

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
Center I'm going to go ahead and turn on

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.640 
Center I'm going to go ahead and turn on
slide<00:02:59.040> right<00:02:59.400> in<00:02:59.580> bounce<00:03:00.320> so<00:03:01.320> as<00:03:01.380> you<00:03:01.440> can<00:03:01.530> see

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
slide right in bounce so as you can see

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.780 
slide right in bounce so as you can see
it<00:03:01.770> came<00:03:01.890> in<00:03:02.010> from<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.220> right<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.550> it<00:03:02.640> did<00:03:02.760> a

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
it came in from the right and it did a

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.590 
it came in from the right and it did a
little<00:03:02.940> bounce<00:03:03.180> there<00:03:04.130> and<00:03:05.130> then<00:03:05.820> slide<00:03:06.180> left

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
little bounce there and then slide left

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.330 
little bounce there and then slide left
in<00:03:06.870> bounce<00:03:07.230> would<00:03:07.500> be<00:03:07.650> obviously<00:03:08.190> the

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
in bounce would be obviously the

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.250 
in bounce would be obviously the
opposite<00:03:08.850> actually<00:03:09.360> really<00:03:09.840> like<00:03:09.990> this<00:03:10.110> one

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
opposite actually really like this one

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.020 
opposite actually really like this one
it<00:03:10.380> kind<00:03:10.440> of<00:03:10.530> reminds<00:03:10.860> me<00:03:10.920> of<00:03:11.010> OSX<00:03:11.760> when<00:03:11.970> you

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
it kind of reminds me of OSX when you

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.080 
it kind of reminds me of OSX when you
get<00:03:12.150> notifications<00:03:12.750> so<00:03:13.650> there<00:03:13.980> you<00:03:14.010> go<00:03:14.130> there

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
get notifications so there you go there

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.480 
get notifications so there you go there
is<00:03:15.240> slide<00:03:15.540> left<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:15.960> bounce<00:03:16.200> now<00:03:17.070> here<00:03:17.340> these

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
is slide left and bounce now here these

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:18.979 
is slide left and bounce now here these
last<00:03:17.730> three<00:03:18.000> options<00:03:18.360> are<00:03:18.540> just<00:03:18.810> kind<00:03:18.900> of

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
last three options are just kind of

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.990 
last three options are just kind of
miscellaneous<00:03:19.410> things<00:03:19.650> you<00:03:20.520> can<00:03:20.670> actually

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
miscellaneous things you can actually

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.330 
miscellaneous things you can actually
have<00:03:21.150> your<00:03:21.360> notifications<00:03:22.020> be<00:03:22.709> spoken<00:03:23.040> to<00:03:23.250> you

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
have your notifications be spoken to you

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.740 
have your notifications be spoken to you
which<00:03:23.520> is<00:03:23.550> very<00:03:23.880> very<00:03:24.060> cool<00:03:24.239> so<00:03:24.480> I'll<00:03:24.600> do<00:03:24.720> a

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
which is very very cool so I'll do a

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.930 
which is very very cool so I'll do a
test<00:03:27.230> so<00:03:28.230> there<00:03:28.410> you<00:03:28.530> go<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:28.920> then<00:03:29.700> you<00:03:29.790> also

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
test so there you go and then you also

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.750 
test so there you go and then you also
do<00:03:30.180> have<00:03:30.420> a<00:03:30.450> hog<00:03:30.930> fade<00:03:31.320> for<00:03:32.100> your<00:03:32.220> volume<00:03:32.580> HUD

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
do have a hog fade for your volume HUD

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
your notification center as you can see

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.770 
your notification center as you can see
right<00:03:58.709> there<00:03:59.010> which<00:03:59.190> is<00:03:59.239> really<00:04:00.239> quite<00:04:00.420> cool

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
right there which is really quite cool

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.170 
right there which is really quite cool
in<00:04:00.989> my<00:04:01.050> opinion<00:04:01.200> so<00:04:01.739> that<00:04:02.310> is<00:04:02.430> transparent<00:04:02.820> and

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
in my opinion so that is transparent and

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.460 
in my opinion so that is transparent and
see<00:04:03.450> basically<00:04:03.870> where<00:04:04.080> there's<00:04:04.230> going<00:04:04.380> to<00:04:04.440> be

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
see basically where there's going to be

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.800 
see basically where there's going to be
a<00:04:04.560> background<00:04:05.160> in<00:04:05.850> your<00:04:06.000> notification<00:04:06.209> center

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
a background in your notification center

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.540 
a background in your notification center
not<00:04:06.989> where<00:04:07.140> widgets<00:04:07.470> are<00:04:07.620> you<00:04:08.220> can<00:04:08.400> see

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
not where widgets are you can see

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.030 
not where widgets are you can see
through<00:04:08.790> it<00:04:08.820> and<00:04:08.970> interact<00:04:09.420> through<00:04:09.660> it<00:04:09.810> and
