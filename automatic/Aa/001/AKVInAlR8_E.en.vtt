00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 more than civil word first image of 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.390
 now you see me 2 and avatar overdue 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.390
 welcome to jl vision 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.070
 it seems that for the writers is not 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.490
 being easy to make this new movie 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.100
 the civil war but if they do not put spiderman 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.930
 and it was one of the clear comic shapes 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.090
 they have to change many things for 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.010
 example they are peggy crankcase and 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.380
 Tony Stark is one of the things that 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.360
 they know how to write what they say is like 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.000
 we have not started to shoot yet and I'm going 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.210
 to the fourth draft of many 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.530
 the question is who is hit for tony 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.180
 stark is still in the air who knows 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.430
 many things can change but now 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.250
 we have had conversations and imagined 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.010
 scenes some of them will remain and 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.440
 others did not but we saw peggy in the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.270
 winter soldier so we know that 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.010
 will be as far as painting here 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.110
 black panther have not yet revealed anything 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.300
 although I suspect that maybe they will 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.210
 change some things to fit in 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.710
 the role that spiderman would also 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.330
 thanks to what one of the 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.310
 directors of the film we know that 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.799
 scarlett johansson will participate again 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.960
 in this film as a black widow we 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.549
 we have been preparing to receive war 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.250
 since the soldier's release 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.200
 winter last year so it takes 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.960
 working on it for a long time 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.060
 We are proud of how it is coming out 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.220
 capitan america 3 will be called in america 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.290
 civil war and in it chris will appear 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.530
 evans return to scarlett johansson 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.180
 will return the winter soldier and robert 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.300
 dan juniors also join in as 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.740
 ironman apparently the news came out of 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.380
 that we would see neither more nor less than 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.650
 spiderman in avengers infinity ward 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:50.729
 part 1 but only just denied me 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:53.009
 that rumor saying that it was something very 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.899
 old that belonged to some ancient and 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.899
 that already that is not even talked about 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.159
 image of one of the dinosaurs of 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.619
 jurassic word in this image we can see 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.909
 what is supposed to be the rex be 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.729
 dinosaur that they create in the and 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.629
 genetically that is super bad in super 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.980
 great super weight apart from being a little 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:16.530
 I do not see that I have many 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.049
 differences of tiranosaurus rex maybe 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.670
 have to see him more in action so that he 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:22.140
 note the big difference but that 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.879
 it has a kind of thorns but 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.220
 apart from that I do not see either 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:28.260
 difference first image of now sees me 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.900
 it's 2 that we can see now daniel 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.400
 radclife between the cast of 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.900
 done what we can see is the four 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.819
 protagonists of the first part that 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.049
 they made magicians to the province that 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.239
 I tried to catch them in the 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:41.250
 first the mark ruffalo and also 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.560
 we can see that michael caine returns in 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.410
 this new movie and daniel verbis that 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.690
 in this area of ​​your child and the plane that 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.430
 they were in the first part so we can 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.140
 see them all points in this 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.420
 image and we can see what that harry 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.670
 potter returns to magic besides that 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.950
 we can also see that you demand to see 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.350
 has very little light hair recently rolled 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.060
 batman versus superman and it seems that 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.340
 he went bald or at least that's what 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.650
 rumored 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.080
 Well, we are already in 2015 and it seems that 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.170
 avatar does not release yet and in 2016 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.780
 neither does that rate appear until 2017 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.670
 the second part of avatar and to know already 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.580
 when they release the avatar 3 and 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.290
 avatar 4 apparently this is because 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.239
 they want to do the three films together 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.060
 and do so many movies together because they 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.920
 they take more time to make them the truth that 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.160
 I did not expect that in 2015 this 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.200
 movie but in 2016 at least yes and 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.230
 it seems that there will not be to wait 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.730
 a lot to go back to pandora david 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.799
 Fincher seems to be preparing a new 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.470
 movie that will be a kind of remake 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.000
 of strangers in a train but now 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.519
 they will be an airplane so it should be 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.560
 strange subjects on an airplane and it will be 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.940
 starring ben affleck who with 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.330
 who already worked in the movie 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.060
 lost 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:59.770
