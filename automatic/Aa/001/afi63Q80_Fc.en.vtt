00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.990
 for today we are going to recycle and 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.960
 let's do a craft for 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.000
 decorate our garden but this is 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.820
 special to tour our garden 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.380
 night does not work for us because it does not 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.240
 will appreciate the legs and if they have 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.399
 a family meeting as well as at night if 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.670
 is this going to serve a lot like this for 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.440
 decorate the garden like this with many things and 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.390
 you will be too excited 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.370
 obviously how are we going to recycle 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.620
 we are going to use things that I showed you in 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.170
 our little house so that we do not have to 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.530
 touch anything so let's go and see how 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.510
 it's done but it does not matter 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.660
 first you will need a fresco of these 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.039
 where the jams come from or I'm not and 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.110
 I'm going to use this where the 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.640
 scientific nutella 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.940
 you will need glue and I recommend you 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.850
 I use hot silicone or bar 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.400
 of comedians and you'll also need 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.110
 twigs to use the ones that are already 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.369
 voted on the ground so they do not break 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.369
 the trees and follow 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.000
 first put to heat the gun and 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.930
 then take a twig in my candle in the 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.240
 long glass 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.130
 cut by hand so it 's super easy 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.990
 you do not necessarily have to use 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.860
 scissors because the idea quique of means 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.770
 rustic now put glue as well as 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.980
 A line 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.210
 in the step or the boat 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.210
 and for branches 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:52.040
 I was like that little ball and I took it out 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.630
 try to paste it very well by pressing the 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.760
 when the slope you have to press 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.800
 the very very well so that it does not come off 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.900
 well now I'm going to take another one and I'm going to 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:09.420
 do the same thing I'm going to measure it I'm going to 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.420
 cut to glues and pencil 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.569
 and well and so you're going to be doing with 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.359
 all products 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:31.599
 at the bottom of where it is stated 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:35.459
 the pot you cited you have to leave it 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.459
 right straight 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.250
 because if you leave it like that one longer and 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.530
 others short when the cup is standing 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.330
 is going to stay like the guided then 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.940
 is going to be painted then try to 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.620
 go them leaving well even in the part 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.660
 from below in the part above you can go 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.660
 leaving some short lengths 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:04.129
 and so he goes placing the stick by stick 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.129
 all around the cup 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.209
 as you go on doing and the 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.040
 you get used to it and already 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.040
 high grabbing the technique and so 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.750
 and once it's finished it will stay like that 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.400
 with all the hundred sticks of the cacique 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.799
 Yes, very pretty 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.329
 and try to give him a lot of glue but 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.760
 if it is necessary obviously to paste it very 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:38.709
 very good but you can do a lot 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.709
 silicone so it is not so bright 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.980
 now cut it in by a candle 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.730
 turn on the 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:02.800
 and peace turns off the light 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.800
 and it looks very pretty 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:09.030
 the branches make the light pass through them 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.970
 and do as a figure as well as 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.500
 guinea and super nice really 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.580
 love too much 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.580
 and you see the candle 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.359
 as a plant then 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:34.680
 how nice 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.050
 there you see that there is less 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.830
 but good with these things it ends 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.830
 it looks very nice 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:54.129
 and well well finished and it looks beautiful 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.129
 health in half 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.090
 there you see 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.520
 hey I do not think so 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.879
 finish 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.319
 and I hope you liked it and asked 

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:11.509
