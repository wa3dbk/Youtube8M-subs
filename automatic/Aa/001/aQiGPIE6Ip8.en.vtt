00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
hey youtube this is my brothers 2001 TTR

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.589 
hey youtube this is my brothers 2001 TTR
125<00:00:05.100> so<00:00:06.089> we<00:00:06.480> got<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:06.750> problem<00:00:06.990> solved<00:00:08.269> it<00:00:09.269> used

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
125 so we got the problem solved it used

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.839 
125 so we got the problem solved it used
to<00:00:09.840> piss<00:00:10.139> gas<00:00:10.469> out<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.830> overflow<00:00:11.099> every<00:00:11.639> time

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
to piss gas out the overflow every time

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.220 
to piss gas out the overflow every time
you<00:00:12.030> turn<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.450> fuel<00:00:12.929> valve<00:00:13.290> on<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:14.490> so<00:00:15.480> we<00:00:15.719> we

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
you turn the fuel valve on and so we we

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.450 
you turn the fuel valve on and so we we
fix<00:00:16.560> that<00:00:18.140> so<00:00:19.140> I'm<00:00:19.350> just<00:00:19.560> on<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.740> cord<00:00:20.130> here

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
fix that so I'm just on a cord here

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.509 
fix that so I'm just on a cord here
fricking<00:00:21.289> cameras<00:00:22.289> almost<00:00:22.590> dead<00:00:22.830> so<00:00:23.100> we<00:00:23.220> fixed

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
fricking cameras almost dead so we fixed

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.599 
fricking cameras almost dead so we fixed
that<00:00:24.230> there's<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.410> overflow<00:00:25.949> tube<00:00:26.250> over

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
that there's the overflow tube over

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.700 
that there's the overflow tube over
there<00:00:26.789> where<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.689> used<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.990> come<00:00:28.140> out<00:00:28.289> used<00:00:28.619> to

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
there where it used to come out used to

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.400 
there where it used to come out used to
come<00:00:28.830> out<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:29.099> too<00:00:29.869> non-stop<00:00:30.869> every<00:00:31.230> time

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
come out that too non-stop every time

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.790 
come out that too non-stop every time
the<00:00:31.650> valve<00:00:32.279> was<00:00:32.460> on<00:00:32.899> so<00:00:33.899> we<00:00:34.020> fixed<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.680> was

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
the valve was on so we fixed that it was

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.910 
the valve was on so we fixed that it was
just<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.630> little<00:00:36.630> thing<00:00:36.870> inside<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.320> carb<00:00:37.590> the

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
just a little thing inside the carb the

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.979 
just a little thing inside the carb the
little<00:00:38.160> plastic<00:00:38.640> thing<00:00:38.910> was<00:00:39.180> out<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.870> place

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
little plastic thing was out of place

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.619 
little plastic thing was out of place
it's<00:00:40.320> not<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.610> float<00:00:41.910> level<00:00:42.149> thing<00:00:42.480> that

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
it's not the the float level thing that

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.000 
it's not the the float level thing that
levels<00:00:42.870> out<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.079> gas<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.440> wasn't<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.800> it's

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
levels out the gas it wasn't that it's

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.380 
levels out the gas it wasn't that it's
like<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.309> thing<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.670> goes<00:00:44.789> on<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.000> pilot

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
like the thing that goes on the pilot

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.410 
like the thing that goes on the pilot
jet<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:46.230> fell<00:00:46.530> off<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.370> we<00:00:47.789> put<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.120> back<00:00:48.210> up

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
jet it fell off so we put it back up

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.439 
jet it fell off so we put it back up
there<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:48.989> stopped<00:00:50.030> yeah<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.239> when<00:00:51.360> my

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
there and it stopped yeah so when my

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.029 
there and it stopped yeah so when my
brother<00:00:51.660> first<00:00:51.930> bought<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.289> bike<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.739> wasn't

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
brother first bought this bike it wasn't

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.869 
brother first bought this bike it wasn't
running<00:00:54.260> put<00:00:55.260> new<00:00:55.410> gas<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.100> new<00:00:56.280> spark<00:00:56.640> plug

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
running put new gas in it new spark plug

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.029 
running put new gas in it new spark plug
clean<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.300> carb<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.750> fired<00:00:58.020> right<00:00:58.140> up<00:00:58.320> it

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.279 
clean the carb it fired right up it
still<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.430> one<00:00:59.460> problem<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.449> air<00:01:00.600> filter<00:01:01.109> is

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
still is one problem the air filter is

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.219 
still is one problem the air filter is
missing<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.579> what<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.820> did<00:01:02.940> was<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.510> just<00:01:03.570> I

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
missing so what I did was I just I

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.260 
missing so what I did was I just I
looked<00:01:04.619> at<00:01:04.769> other<00:01:05.270> TTR<00:01:06.270> 125<00:01:06.479> air<00:01:07.320> filters<00:01:07.860> I

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
looked at other TTR 125 air filters I

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.570 
looked at other TTR 125 air filters I
custom-made<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.299> slide<00:01:09.890> because<00:01:10.890> it's<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.280> slide

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
custom-made a slide because it's a slide

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.359 
custom-made a slide because it's a slide
and<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:11.909> put<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.320> sponge<00:01:13.320> on<00:01:13.590> there<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:13.890> took<00:01:14.040> off

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
and I put a sponge on there I took off

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.249 
and I put a sponge on there I took off
the<00:01:14.400> green<00:01:15.240> stuff<00:01:15.540> off<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.869> back<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.049> the

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
the green stuff off the back of the

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.280 
the green stuff off the back of the
sponge<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:16.830> it's<00:01:16.950> just<00:01:17.130> pure<00:01:18.060> foam<00:01:18.360> with<00:01:18.720> air

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
sponge so it's just pure foam with air

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.560 
sponge so it's just pure foam with air
filter<00:01:19.650> oil<00:01:19.680> on<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.250> it's<00:01:20.939> holding<00:01:21.270> up<00:01:21.390> pretty

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
filter oil on it it's holding up pretty

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.020 
filter oil on it it's holding up pretty
good<00:01:21.659> for<00:01:22.020> now

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
good for now

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
see if I can get an air filter that

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.510 
see if I can get an air filter that
hangs<00:01:28.740> off<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:28.979> carb<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:30.060> yeah<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.829> TTR

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
hangs off the carb so yeah so the TTR

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.760 
hangs off the carb so yeah so the TTR
125<00:01:32.700> problems<00:01:33.479> fixed<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:34.110> runs<00:01:34.380> great

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
125 problems fixed it runs great

all right fuels off yeah and then this
is<00:02:48.409> my<00:02:48.640> 2001<00:02:49.640> C<00:02:49.879> or<00:02:49.969> et<00:02:50.349> this<00:02:51.349> thing<00:02:51.709> is<00:02:51.799> in

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:52.689 
is my 2001 C or et this thing is in

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:56.589 
is my 2001 C or et this thing is in
motors<00:02:53.689> in<00:02:53.900> way<00:02:54.109> great<00:02:54.469> shape<00:02:54.909> this<00:02:55.909> old<00:02:56.150> one<00:02:56.359> I

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
motors in way great shape this old one I
