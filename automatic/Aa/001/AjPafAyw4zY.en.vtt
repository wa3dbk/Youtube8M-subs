and the scoring is done with reed

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.920 
and the scoring is done with reed
switches<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.799> also<00:01:29.759> sound<00:01:30.000> effects<00:01:30.329> so

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
funneled down into this channel slides

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.230 
funneled down into this channel slides
down<00:01:52.920> over<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.520> where<00:01:53.640> there's<00:01:53.790> an<00:01:53.909> armature

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
down over to where there's an armature

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.080 
down over to where there's an armature
in<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.990> thus<00:01:55.439> Illinois<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.100> kicks<00:01:56.579> the

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
puck back up onto the play field so

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.520 
puck back up onto the play field so
let's<00:02:00.030> just<00:02:00.240> drop<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:00.930> there

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
let's just drop it in there

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.590 
let's just drop it in there
um<00:02:03.530> you<00:02:03.920> need<00:02:04.009> to<00:02:04.130> keep<00:02:04.250> this<00:02:04.490> channel<00:02:05.299> very

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
um you need to keep this channel very

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.359 
um you need to keep this channel very
clean<00:02:06.020> because<00:02:06.229> any<00:02:06.470> debris<00:02:06.740> will<00:02:07.040> prevent

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
clean because any debris will prevent

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.820
