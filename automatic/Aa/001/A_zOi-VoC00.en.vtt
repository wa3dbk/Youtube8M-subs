bar ray's disco to cross the car makes

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.040 
bar ray's disco to cross the car makes
it<00:00:37.520> not<00:00:37.670> only<00:00:37.820> to<00:00:38.030> stiffen<00:00:38.420> the<00:00:38.540> chassis<00:00:38.570> in

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
it not only to stiffen the chassis in

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.549 
it not only to stiffen the chassis in
the<00:00:39.140> rear<00:00:39.320> but<00:00:39.800> also<00:00:40.420> is<00:00:41.420> a<00:00:41.480> much<00:00:41.780> better<00:00:41.809> more

efficient<00:00:43.040> place<00:00:43.220> for<00:00:43.460> the<00:00:43.550> sway<00:00:43.760> bar<00:00:43.790> to<00:00:44.180> pull

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
efficient place for the sway bar to pull

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.200 
efficient place for the sway bar to pull
so<00:00:44.989> we<00:00:45.170> have<00:00:45.350> an<00:00:45.530> upgraded<00:00:46.220> sway<00:00:46.550> bar<00:00:46.760> package

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
so we have an upgraded sway bar package
