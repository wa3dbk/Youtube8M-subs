00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
basic view of them so let's get started

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.240 
basic view of them so let's get started
I'm<00:00:31.539> just<00:00:31.599> gonna<00:00:31.810> go<00:00:31.989> ahead<00:00:32.079> and<00:00:32.169> move<00:00:32.860> this

it's not an open yet
I<00:00:34.750> don't<00:00:35.680> know<00:00:35.830> what<00:00:36.010> to<00:00:36.280> expect<00:00:36.580> from<00:00:37.300> it<00:00:38.160> it

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
I don't know what to expect from it it

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.069 
I don't know what to expect from it it
is<00:00:39.280> you<00:00:39.430> can<00:00:39.640> see<00:00:39.850> it<00:00:40.059> it<00:00:40.300> actually<00:00:40.510> comes<00:00:40.839> in<00:00:40.989> a

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
is you can see it it actually comes in a

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:57.630 
is you can see it it actually comes in a
pretty<00:00:41.290> nice<00:00:43.920> caring<00:00:44.920> box<00:00:45.129> here

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.030 

so<00:00:58.640> the<00:00:59.240> back<00:00:59.420> of<00:00:59.450> the<00:00:59.660> card<00:00:59.900> is<00:01:00.230> pretty<00:01:00.860> much

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
so the back of the card is pretty much

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.990 
so the back of the card is pretty much
just<00:01:01.220> all<00:01:01.340> blog<00:01:02.620> it<00:01:03.620> does<00:01:04.010> have<00:01:04.220> a<00:01:04.430> slight

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
just all blog it does have a slight

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.400 
just all blog it does have a slight
slight<00:01:08.000> pattern<00:01:08.360> on<00:01:08.630> it<00:01:08.750> on<00:01:08.870> the<00:01:08.930> back<00:01:08.960> that's

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.410 
slight pattern on it on the back that's

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.560 
slight pattern on it on the back that's
very<00:01:09.650> hard<00:01:09.860> to<00:01:09.979> see<00:01:10.220> on<00:01:11.530> the<00:01:12.530> front<00:01:12.860> while

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
very hard to see on the front while

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.870 
very hard to see on the front while
front<00:01:14.570> is<00:01:14.690> pretty<00:01:14.780> hard<00:01:15.080> to<00:01:15.229> see<00:01:15.700> what<00:01:16.700> they<00:01:16.820> do

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
front is pretty hard to see what they do

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.550 
front is pretty hard to see what they do
out<00:01:17.210> of<00:01:17.390> that<00:01:18.790> basic<00:01:19.790> pattern<00:01:20.270> to<00:01:20.510> it<00:01:20.660> but<00:01:21.410> it's

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
out of that basic pattern to it but it's

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.410 
out of that basic pattern to it but it's
very<00:01:21.740> hard<00:01:21.979> to<00:01:22.130> see<00:01:22.610> actually

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.380 

guys<00:01:26.869> notices<00:01:27.710> I'm<00:01:28.490> looking<00:01:28.759> directly<00:01:28.939> at<00:01:29.149> it

don't<00:03:21.970> bend<00:03:22.210> very<00:03:22.510> easily<00:03:22.780> so<00:03:23.530> let's<00:03:23.920> pick

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
don't bend very easily so let's pick

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.860 
don't bend very easily so let's pick
what<00:03:24.370> their<00:03:24.640> firm

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
what their firm

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:32.120 
what their firm
maybe<00:03:26.350> it'll<00:03:26.530> hold<00:03:26.770> its<00:03:26.920> shape<00:03:27.070> better<00:03:30.720> yeah

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
maybe it'll hold its shape better yeah

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.040 
maybe it'll hold its shape better yeah
I'm<00:03:33.130> afraid<00:03:33.250> I'm<00:03:34.150> not<00:03:34.270> very<00:03:34.420> good<00:03:34.510> chef<00:03:34.810> align

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
I'm afraid I'm not very good chef align

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.410 
I'm afraid I'm not very good chef align
the<00:03:35.140> water<00:03:35.320> so<00:03:35.980> on<00:03:36.340> a<00:03:36.400> scale<00:03:36.670> of<00:03:36.820> one<00:03:37.060> to<00:03:37.090> ten

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
the water so on a scale of one to ten

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.910 
the water so on a scale of one to ten
I'd<00:03:37.630> give<00:03:37.660> it<00:03:37.959> about<00:03:38.050> a<00:03:38.170> seven<00:03:38.709> and<00:03:38.800> a<00:03:38.890> half

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
I'd give it about a seven and a half

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.580 
I'd give it about a seven and a half
only<00:03:39.760> because<00:03:40.300> it's<00:03:40.750> very<00:03:40.870> difficult<00:03:41.110> to<00:03:41.380> see

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
only because it's very difficult to see

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.490 
only because it's very difficult to see
and<00:03:42.720> that's<00:03:43.720> pretty<00:03:44.080> much<00:03:44.200> it

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
and that's pretty much it

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.560 
and that's pretty much it
but<00:03:44.800> I<00:03:45.040> think<00:03:45.250> they're<00:03:45.580> really<00:03:45.970> good<00:03:46.120> cards

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
but I think they're really good cards

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.960 
but I think they're really good cards
there's<00:03:47.440> it<00:03:47.830> doesn't<00:03:48.040> make<00:03:48.130> any<00:03:48.220> fingerprints

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
there's it doesn't make any fingerprints

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.350 
there's it doesn't make any fingerprints
or<00:03:49.090> anything<00:03:49.300> comes<00:03:50.230> in<00:03:50.350> a<00:03:50.410> really<00:03:50.620> nice<00:03:50.830> box

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
or anything comes in a really nice box

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.110 
or anything comes in a really nice box
and<00:03:52.950> yeah<00:03:53.950> you<00:03:54.459> guys<00:03:54.580> should<00:03:54.610> definitely<00:03:54.820> pick

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
and yeah you guys should definitely pick

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.000 
and yeah you guys should definitely pick
this<00:03:55.180> up<00:03:55.330> I<00:03:55.690> think<00:03:55.750> they're<00:03:55.990> only<00:03:56.170> $9.99<00:03:56.770> but

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
this up I think they're only $9.99 but

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.199 
this up I think they're only $9.99 but
again<00:03:57.190> I'm<00:03:57.280> not<00:03:57.340> sure<00:03:57.700> you're<00:03:57.940> gonna<00:03:58.030> have<00:03:58.150> to

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
again I'm not sure you're gonna have to

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.140 
again I'm not sure you're gonna have to
go<00:03:58.300> on<00:03:58.390> vat19<00:03:58.840> to<00:03:58.930> find<00:03:59.110> out<00:03:59.200> for<00:03:59.320> yourself

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
go on vat19 to find out for yourself

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.940 
go on vat19 to find out for yourself
