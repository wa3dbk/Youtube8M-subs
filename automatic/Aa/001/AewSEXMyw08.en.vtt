00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.600
 hereby also could telephone in 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.479

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.450

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:48.910
 Inside is a battery installed with four

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.240
 second time measured 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.770
 they are relatively good, I believe that one 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.140
 now 85 hours 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.500

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.360

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.500
 I would not call now 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.700
 I would then he would 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:09.459
