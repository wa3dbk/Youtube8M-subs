throughout<00:00:46.260> all<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.620> EOD<00:00:47.160> games<00:00:47.430> but<00:00:47.700> in<00:00:47.910> this

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
throughout all the EOD games but in this

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.119 
throughout all the EOD games but in this
game<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.390> found<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.200> perceived<00:00:49.739> recoil

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
game I found that the perceived recoil

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.430 
game I found that the perceived recoil
is<00:00:50.520> usually<00:00:51.149> worse<00:00:51.390> on<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.660> iron<00:00:51.870> sights<00:00:52.140> I

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
is usually worse on the iron sights I

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.380 
is usually worse on the iron sights I
don't<00:00:52.590> know<00:00:52.649> what<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.070> but<00:00:53.100> seem<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.000> be

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
don't know what it is but seem to be

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.479 
don't know what it is but seem to be
able<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.660> be<00:00:54.780> more<00:00:54.899> accurate<00:00:55.140> with<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.710> red

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
able to be more accurate with the red

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.189 
able to be more accurate with the red
dot<00:00:56.670> sights<00:00:56.969> in<00:00:57.090> this<00:00:57.210> game<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:57.539> I've<00:00:57.629> been<00:00:57.809> you

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
dot sights in this game so I've been you

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.400 
dot sights in this game so I've been you
know<00:00:58.309> use<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.460> net<00:00:59.640> were<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.359> need<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:01.020> on<00:01:01.289> the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
know use the net were I need to on the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.560 
know use the net were I need to on the
gun<00:01:01.590> set<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.489> iron<00:01:02.699> sights<00:01:02.940> just<00:01:03.180> don't<00:01:03.359> fit

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
gun set the iron sights just don't fit

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.560 
gun set the iron sights just don't fit
me<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:04.080> know<00:01:04.229> sometimes<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:05.280> gotta<00:01:05.570> try

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
me you know sometimes you gotta try

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.710 
me you know sometimes you gotta try
something<00:01:06.600> different<00:01:07.200> get<00:01:08.070> those<00:01:08.670> shots<00:01:09.330> on

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
something different get those shots on

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.490 
something different get those shots on
target<00:01:11.119> stuff<00:01:12.119> like<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.330> so<00:01:12.990> yeah<00:01:13.260> that's

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
target stuff like that so yeah that's

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.660 
target stuff like that so yeah that's
the<00:01:13.710> reasoning<00:01:14.040> behind<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.549> red<00:01:14.790> dot<00:01:15.060> sight

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
the reasoning behind the red dot sight

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.200 
the reasoning behind the red dot sight
anyway<00:01:17.670> this<00:01:18.150> gun<00:01:18.479> can<00:01:18.869> be<00:01:18.900> quite<00:01:19.229> beastly<00:01:20.210> if

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
anyway this gun can be quite beastly if

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.749 
anyway this gun can be quite beastly if
you<00:01:21.540> use<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:21.840> correctly<00:01:22.110> or<00:01:22.500> sometimes<00:01:23.460> if<00:01:23.640> you

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
you use it correctly or sometimes if you

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.130 
you use it correctly or sometimes if you
get<00:01:23.880> lucky<00:01:24.030> like<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.750> can<00:01:24.869> use<00:01:24.900> it

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
get lucky like this you can use it

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.249 
get lucky like this you can use it
incorrectly<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.860> do<00:01:26.850> some<00:01:27.000> work<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.390> as<00:01:28.200> a

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
incorrectly and do some work and as a

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.719 
incorrectly and do some work and as a
decent<00:01:28.500> rate<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.920> fire<00:01:29.070> it's<00:01:29.340> not<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.579> highest

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
decent rate of fire it's not the highest

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.999 
decent rate of fire it's not the highest
but<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.570> sink<00:01:30.810> puts<00:01:31.020> down<00:01:31.140> people<00:01:31.439> very

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
but the sink puts down people very

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.429 
but the sink puts down people very
quickly<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.759> i<00:01:33.509> always<00:01:33.750> recommend<00:01:34.049> using

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
quickly and i always recommend using

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.330 
quickly and i always recommend using
stock<00:01:34.829> for<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.150> Martian<00:01:36.150> gone<00:01:36.680> as<00:01:37.680> will<00:01:38.220> give

for<00:03:35.349> a<00:03:35.410> defensive<00:03:35.889> play<00:03:36.130> style<00:03:36.489> you<00:03:36.970> can<00:03:37.859> pick

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
for a defensive play style you can pick

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:40.650 
for a defensive play style you can pick
off<00:03:39.040> people<00:03:39.340> from<00:03:39.519> a<00:03:39.609> distance<00:03:40.000> because<00:03:40.329> you

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
off people from a distance because you

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.629 
off people from a distance because you
know<00:03:40.750> it<00:03:40.930> has<00:03:41.049> relatively<00:03:41.650> low<00:03:41.950> recoil<00:03:42.220> and

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
know it has relatively low recoil and

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.059 
know it has relatively low recoil and
the<00:03:43.150> lower<00:03:43.630> rate<00:03:43.870> of<00:03:43.989> fire<00:03:44.169> makes<00:03:44.440> it<00:03:44.590> really

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
the lower rate of fire makes it really

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.129 
the lower rate of fire makes it really
easy<00:03:45.190> to<00:03:45.549> control<00:03:45.849> right<00:03:46.150> so<00:03:46.750> I<00:03:46.780> was<00:03:47.019> like

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:47.139 
easy to control right so I was like

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:49.620 
easy to control right so I was like

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
sniping people with the MK 48 so the

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:50.970
