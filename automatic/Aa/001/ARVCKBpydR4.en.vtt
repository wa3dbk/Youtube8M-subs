kale is cut it's time to move on to the
next<00:01:16.720> step<00:01:16.930> and<00:01:17.200> we're<00:01:17.830> just<00:01:17.920> going<00:01:18.070> to<00:01:18.130> take<00:01:18.400> 1

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
next step and we're just going to take 1

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.070 
next step and we're just going to take 1
tablespoon<00:01:20.110> of<00:01:20.440> extra<00:01:21.310> virgin<00:01:21.340> olive<00:01:21.790> oil<00:01:22.180> put

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil put

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.100 
tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil put
it<00:01:23.170> in<00:01:23.230> this<00:01:23.320> bowl<00:01:23.590> and<00:01:24.510> we're<00:01:25.510> going<00:01:25.750> to<00:01:25.780> toss

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
it in this bowl and we're going to toss

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.560 
it in this bowl and we're going to toss
the<00:01:26.410> kale<00:01:26.680> in<00:01:26.890> it<00:01:27.010> I<00:01:27.130> would<00:01:27.370> recommend<00:01:27.850> doing

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
the kale in it I would recommend doing

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.300 
the kale in it I would recommend doing
it<00:01:28.870> in<00:01:29.590> two<00:01:31.320> sets<00:01:32.320> instead<00:01:32.650> of<00:01:32.830> trying<00:01:33.040> to<00:01:33.100> fit

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
it in two sets instead of trying to fit

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.610 
it in two sets instead of trying to fit
all<00:01:33.490> of<00:01:33.520> it<00:01:33.790> um<00:01:33.970> you<00:01:34.540> could<00:01:34.690> do<00:01:34.870> this<00:01:35.020> in<00:01:35.320> a

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
all of it um you could do this in a

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.340 
all of it um you could do this in a
giant<00:01:35.890> bowl<00:01:36.330> with<00:01:37.330> all<00:01:37.360> the<00:01:37.690> kale<00:01:37.900> but<00:01:38.200> it

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
giant bowl with all the kale but it

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.780 
giant bowl with all the kale but it
would<00:01:38.440> be<00:01:38.560> harder<00:01:38.860> to<00:01:38.890> ensure<00:01:39.310> that<00:01:39.340> all<00:01:39.580> of<00:01:39.670> it

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
would be harder to ensure that all of it

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.030 
would be harder to ensure that all of it
gets<00:01:39.940> covered<00:01:40.210> so<00:01:41.050> just<00:01:41.260> toss<00:01:41.440> it<00:01:41.740> it<00:01:41.860> doesn't

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
gets covered so just toss it it doesn't

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.100 
gets covered so just toss it it doesn't
up<00:01:42.340> not<00:01:42.670> every<00:01:42.970> piece<00:01:43.180> has<00:01:43.450> to<00:01:43.480> be<00:01:43.630> completely

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
up not every piece has to be completely

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.020 
up not every piece has to be completely
covered<00:01:44.410> but<00:01:44.710> just<00:01:44.890> so<00:01:45.010> that<00:01:45.190> it's<00:01:45.820> basically

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
covered but just so that it's basically

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.450 
covered but just so that it's basically
covered<00:01:46.780> and<00:01:48.420> then<00:01:49.420> when<00:01:50.170> you've<00:01:50.890> got<00:01:51.100> some

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
covered and then when you've got some

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.410 
covered and then when you've got some
olive<00:01:51.760> oil<00:01:51.850> on<00:01:52.000> each<00:01:52.180> one<00:01:52.420> just<00:01:53.080> place<00:01:53.470> each

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
olive oil on each one just place each

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.490 
olive oil on each one just place each
chip<00:01:55.420> to<00:01:55.630> be<00:01:55.840> on<00:01:56.140> your<00:01:56.860> baking<00:01:57.280> pan<00:01:57.520> um<00:01:58.500> kale

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
chip to be on your baking pan um kale

serving size is this entire tray which
is<00:03:40.489> about<00:03:40.639> the<00:03:40.819> size<00:03:41.030> I<00:03:41.269> think<00:03:41.480> of<00:03:41.540> a<00:03:41.629> bag<00:03:41.780> of

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
is about the size I think of a bag of

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.649 
is about the size I think of a bag of
chips<00:03:42.459> but<00:03:43.459> instead<00:03:43.909> of<00:03:44.060> being<00:03:44.269> loaded<00:03:44.419> up

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:44.659 
chips but instead of being loaded up

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:47.110 
chips but instead of being loaded up
with<00:03:44.900> carbs<00:03:45.530> and<00:03:45.739> fat<00:03:46.340> and<00:03:46.609> all<00:03:46.699> that<00:03:46.849> stuff

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
with carbs and fat and all that stuff

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.289 
with carbs and fat and all that stuff
this<00:03:47.569> entire<00:03:48.169> thing<00:03:48.560> only<00:03:49.010> contains<00:03:49.459> half<00:03:50.060> a

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
this entire thing only contains half a

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.750 
this entire thing only contains half a
gram<00:03:50.569> of<00:03:50.870> fat<00:03:51.470> and<00:03:51.769> all<00:03:52.069> of<00:03:52.310> that's<00:03:52.430> from<00:03:52.699> the

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
gram of fat and all of that's from the

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.819 
gram of fat and all of that's from the
olive<00:03:53.090> oil<00:03:53.299> so<00:03:53.569> if<00:03:53.690> you<00:03:53.810> substitute<00:03:54.049> grapeseed

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
olive oil so if you substitute grapeseed

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.789 
olive oil so if you substitute grapeseed
oil<00:03:55.159> this<00:03:55.639> entire<00:03:56.090> thing<00:03:56.479> would<00:03:56.930> only<00:03:57.199> have<00:03:57.560> a

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
oil this entire thing would only have a

little<00:03:57.979> bit<00:03:58.129> of<00:03:58.430> monounsaturated<00:03:58.849> or<00:03:59.810> the

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
little bit of monounsaturated or the

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.289 
little bit of monounsaturated or the
good<00:04:00.109> fat<00:04:00.379> so<00:04:00.590> this<00:04:00.739> is<00:04:00.859> a<00:04:01.010> super<00:04:01.669> super
