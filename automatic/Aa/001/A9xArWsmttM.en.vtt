00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:07.030
 the duty of the channel is the duty is a 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.220

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.149
 greetings from salvador greetings 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.649
 practice them ortho to a greeting and I think that 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:31.450
 the average person already knows how many 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:33.790
 Most of them mostly because of my twitter 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.409
 is no profile you are obviously my 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.119
 age but for those who do not go by 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.560
 course this question for those who does 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.810
 for my age I'm going to tell you right now 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.759
 I am 17 years old 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.130
 this question is from saul of a greeting 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:48.610
 for you saul who tells me what you think of 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.399
 children rats and vegueta 717 and what 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.369
 youtuber you do not like a greeting for you 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:56.170
 I salute good Saul the truth I think 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.179
 I have a thought that the truth 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.090
 they were then if it is a little more than 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:03.429
 I 'm not lying, I think the children 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.890
 rats I do not think you're being called 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:07.659
 children rats ok I know many say girls 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.019
 Rat child rat because I insult you and that 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:13.540
 I do not think we've all been through 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.549
 be children rats absolutely all 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.379
 that is, we have also had a 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:19.900
 small age and ever playing we have 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:22.090
 insulted a slightly different attitude 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.409
 and well I do not think we should say the 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.329
 child of rats to the poor and those who 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:27.969
 they are playing minecraft and these games 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:29.319
 I think that rather than not 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:31.209
 answer if it starts to insult 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.180
 very well we should leave it quiet 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.769
 so I'm still playing without fighting 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.739
 we want a fair game a game 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.989
 quiet without insulting and not good 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.760
 I also think that it has been more suitable 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.579
 so when I had small 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.019
 humidity there was not so much internet there was 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:50.049
 minecraft very well all that does not stop 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:52.659
 playing playstation 1 play station2 san 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:55.209
 andreas vice city and liberty city so 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:58.920
 those times there was not much rat boy 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:01.680
 and what I think of vegueta 777 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.110
 a respectable respectable that raise it 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.610
 who wants and uses I have nothing against his 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.650
 content and I also like it very much 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.069
 this vegueta video even if you're creating 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.409
 I see that but I see it 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.930
 I do not play minecraft so that I do not play 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:17.909
 nothing about minecraft but sometimes I go through 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.879

 Orta tells me because you no longer have an intro 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:09.000
 in the videos greeting from mexico if the 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.500
 I used to use intro for those who 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.109
 they did not know in my beginnings I had some 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.209

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:16.859

 You tell me what I say because I have not 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:28.229
 I put intros because it takes time 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.639
 precious when starting the videos for me 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:33.139
 it is very important the time in the 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:35.310
 videos and on and that people get the 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:38.270
 information is very important so 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.169
 that's why I stopped using intros for 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.419
 start facing me talking 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:44.550
