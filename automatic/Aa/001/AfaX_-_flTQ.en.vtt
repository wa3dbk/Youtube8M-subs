 this is pertinent by connecting the territory 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.640

 I want to talk about the history of this organism 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.000
 decentralized university 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.800
 what the trains 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.080
 is the cutting edge spearhead and those looking to generate a model 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.180
 effective decline that adapts to the needs of people and 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.360

 he studied the master's degree in public services management in 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.279

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:23.239
 the virtual university system basically offer programs of 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.209
 bachelor's degree

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:31.259
 online 

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:34.899
 when you study in lines what you will find is a platform 

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:38.709
 that is like a kind 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.439
 vet disposition of an environment that can be assimilated to a classroom with 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:47.749
 the difference that you have no companions on the side and a teacher who 

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:50.099
 is watching or what is coming 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.300
 what you find is a series of activities that you have to go 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:55.699
 developing 

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:57.329
 month with month 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:01.510
 generally what we do is a course planning that lasts ten and 

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:05.389
 seven weeks that are the temples that last the cycles in the university of 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:06.559
 Guadalajara 

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:12.079
 and those and that starts the course is planned by activities in which 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:16.219
 always manages bad weekly deliveries biweekly or monthly depending 

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:20.749
 the type of content to review will go 

00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:23.899
 learning objectives that you want to do works 

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:26.849

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:32.169
 since yesterday the buying company 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:35.169
 the most important thing is to go on the attack 

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:41.509
 efe 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:49.019
 the virtual university system is very important to clarify it is part of the network 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.100
 university 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.700
 is an entity more than the University of Guadalajara is an instance with 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.390
 ability to offer bachelor and postgraduate degrees 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.950
 We are integrated into the network offering another possibility to Jalisco citizens and 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.940
 people from all over the country to study in a different way for those who do not 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.940
 they have possibilities especially of time 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.099
 and added that he wanted to be the sponsor 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.870
 the day started on Friday with the weekend 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.729
 that's why it's certainly closer to the city 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.770
 this of having won in an online modality 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:35.930
 it is not easier than studying in a classroom that is a myth 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.319
 implies the same responsibility at the same time as studying a 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:42.229
 Face-to-face modality 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:47.479
 you have to invest it for at least two hours a day. 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:51.339
 you have to comply with certain learning activities you have to 

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:54.939
 do readings do you have to do research do you have to do 

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:59.469
 interviews you have to visit the physical library hello virtual that 

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:03.770
 we also have a virtual library that is all in the same activities 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:04.819
 what would you do 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:09.949
 in one in an amorality presence the only difference is that I do not have to 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:14.860
 to be fixed in a classroom is a determined site of 8 to one 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.110
 fight a school day 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.969
 here the difference is that I 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:23.009
 programmed my times I say sometimes I can study from seven to nine of the 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:26.559
 morning of a 3 from 11 to 2 in the morning 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:35.529
 yes it is true that many times you have to be more concentrated to take it to 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:37.409
 cabo peralta 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:40.409
 the work was happy for the goals 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:45.029
 efe 

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:46.879
 one 

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:51.059
 She is Dr. María Elena Chávez, who is the Institute of Management of the 

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:54.610
 knowledge and learning in virtual environments that not only 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.950
 work the virtual university that are well a user are actually 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.569
 what problems the students face there 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:03.599
 the problem is that surely they are not 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:06.900
 exclusive of virtual education but that we can investigate with greater 

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:11.529
 depth because everything is recorded any job that fema 

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:14.300
 the doubts of the students the ways like 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.819
 and says that they move for example when working as a team everything is left 

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:19.749
 registered in the environments 

00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:23.089
 then, it will be easy for us to identify which are the main 

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:24.069
 problems 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:27.770
 we try to do is develop strategies to improve our 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:28.610
 society 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.460
 the leader for your health 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.719
 2 very specific teachers 

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:36.659
 Spanish
