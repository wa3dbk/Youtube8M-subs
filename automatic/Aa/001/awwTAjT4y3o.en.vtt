off<00:00:21.160> the<00:00:21.430> bat<00:00:21.610> you<00:00:21.790> can<00:00:21.820> see<00:00:21.970> that<00:00:22.270> I<00:00:22.300> have<00:00:22.480> to

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:22.689

structure<00:00:26.740> works<00:00:27.130> differently<00:00:27.730> than<00:00:27.850> all<00:00:28.330> of

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
structure works differently than all of

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.439 
structure works differently than all of
the<00:00:28.990> programs<00:00:29.470> we've<00:00:29.680> covered<00:00:29.920> so<00:00:30.310> far<00:00:30.449> this

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:31.449 
the programs we've covered so far this

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.369 
the programs we've covered so far this
is<00:00:31.930> program<00:00:32.830> as<00:00:33.129> a<00:00:33.660> service<00:00:34.660> so<00:00:35.020> you<00:00:35.050> actually

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:35.379 
is program as a service so you actually

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.729 
is program as a service so you actually
have<00:00:35.800> to<00:00:35.949> spend<00:00:36.340> a<00:00:36.580> monthly<00:00:37.360> fee<00:00:37.629> every<00:00:38.410> single

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
have to spend a monthly fee every single

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.729 
have to spend a monthly fee every single
month<00:00:38.920> to<00:00:39.160> get<00:00:39.520> the<00:00:39.820> service<00:00:40.330> of<00:00:40.570> xsplit<00:00:41.530> so

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
month to get the service of xsplit so

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:43.469 
month to get the service of xsplit so
now<00:00:42.400> that<00:00:42.460> that's<00:00:42.730> out<00:00:43.000> of<00:00:43.030> the<00:00:43.120> way<00:00:43.180> let's

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:43.479 
now that that's out of the way let's

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:45.149 
now that that's out of the way let's
actually<00:00:43.600> show<00:00:44.019> off<00:00:44.229> what<00:00:44.470> the<00:00:44.589> program<00:00:44.949> can

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:45.159 
actually show off what the program can

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:48.119 
actually show off what the program can
do<00:00:45.339> so<00:00:45.760> right<00:00:46.150> off<00:00:46.809> the<00:00:46.989> bat<00:00:47.170> you<00:00:47.379> can<00:00:47.409> see<00:00:47.860> that

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
do so right off the bat you can see that

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:50.640 
do so right off the bat you can see that
we<00:00:48.280> have<00:00:48.550> a<00:00:48.909> few<00:00:49.420> different<00:00:49.870> sort<00:00:50.110> of<00:00:50.199> windows

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:50.650 
we have a few different sort of windows

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.460 
we have a few different sort of windows
on<00:00:50.680> this<00:00:51.100> main<00:00:51.400> window<00:00:51.430> we<00:00:51.940> have<00:00:52.120> what<00:00:52.870> will<00:00:53.140> be

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
on this main window we have what will be

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.250 
on this main window we have what will be
our<00:00:53.769> preview<00:00:54.339> of<00:00:54.550> what<00:00:54.790> we<00:00:54.940> are<00:00:55.059> recording<00:00:55.690> you

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
our preview of what we are recording you

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.250 
our preview of what we are recording you
have<00:00:56.559> a<00:00:56.890> scene<00:00:57.400> structure<00:00:58.390> over<00:00:58.870> here<00:00:59.049> on<00:00:59.140> the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.990 
have a scene structure over here on the
side<00:00:59.470> and<00:00:59.830> then<00:00:59.920> you<00:01:00.040> have<00:01:00.070> your<00:01:00.460> multiple

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
side and then you have your multiple

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.149 
side and then you have your multiple
scenes<00:01:01.269> so<00:01:01.540> to<00:01:01.930> add<00:01:02.080> something<00:01:02.530> to<00:01:02.680> the<00:01:02.920> scene

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:03.159 
scenes so to add something to the scene

move it around I can decide that it

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.060 
move it around I can decide that it

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
sort of the structure that you build

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.580 
sort of the structure that you build
scenes<00:02:09.580> with<00:02:10.060> in<00:02:10.269> xsplit<00:02:10.899> and<00:02:11.080> you<00:02:11.170> can<00:02:11.379> pull

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
scenes with in xsplit and you can pull

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.040 
scenes with in xsplit and you can pull
that<00:02:11.620> down<00:02:11.800> now<00:02:12.519> one<00:02:12.790> thing<00:02:13.599> that<00:02:13.750> it<00:02:13.870> doesn't

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
that down now one thing that it doesn't

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.280 
that down now one thing that it doesn't
have<00:02:14.319> is<00:02:14.470> you<00:02:14.590> can't<00:02:14.920> create<00:02:15.370> a<00:02:15.700> scene<00:02:16.569> when

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
have is you can't create a scene when

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.619 
have is you can't create a scene when
you're<00:02:17.409> not<00:02:17.590> actually<00:02:18.190> live<00:02:18.670> in<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.239> scene<00:02:19.450> so

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
you're not actually live in the scene so

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.229 
you're not actually live in the scene so
if<00:02:19.810> you<00:02:19.989> were<00:02:20.340> broadcasting<00:02:21.340> live

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
if you were broadcasting live

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.480 
if you were broadcasting live
you'd<00:02:22.870> have<00:02:23.019> to<00:02:23.170> switch<00:02:23.469> to<00:02:23.499> a<00:02:23.739> scene

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
you'd have to switch to a scene

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.040 
you'd have to switch to a scene
and<00:02:24.610> everyone<00:02:25.120> would<00:02:25.300> see<00:02:25.570> that<00:02:25.720> you<00:02:25.840> switch

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
and everyone would see that you switch

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.300 
and everyone would see that you switch
the<00:02:26.260> scene<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:26.620> then<00:02:26.710> you<00:02:26.830> could<00:02:27.040> start

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
the scene and then you could start

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.220 
the scene and then you could start
editing<00:02:27.640> there's<00:02:27.880> no<00:02:28.000> way<00:02:28.120> to<00:02:28.180> preview<00:02:28.630> before

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
editing there's no way to preview before

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.580 
editing there's no way to preview before

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
you actually cut live xsplit has a ton

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.200 
you actually cut live xsplit has a ton
of<00:02:32.620> options<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:33.340> can<00:02:33.490> see<00:02:33.700> that<00:02:33.850> I<00:02:33.880> already

unfortunately while you're broadcasting

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.220 
unfortunately while you're broadcasting
you<00:03:11.440> cannot<00:03:11.950> switch<00:03:12.640> which<00:03:13.360> microphone<00:03:13.390> you

you cannot switch which microphone you
use<00:03:14.500> also<00:03:15.370> you<00:03:15.430> have<00:03:15.730> different<00:03:16.210> levels<00:03:16.360> for

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
use also you have different levels for

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.890 
use also you have different levels for
this<00:03:17.560> is<00:03:17.800> your<00:03:18.010> PC<00:03:18.490> audio<00:03:18.730> so<00:03:19.330> ingame<00:03:19.870> audio

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
this is your PC audio so ingame audio

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.500 
this is your PC audio so ingame audio
and<00:03:20.560> this<00:03:20.890> is<00:03:21.160> your<00:03:21.430> mic<00:03:21.670> so<00:03:21.970> you<00:03:22.000> can<00:03:22.120> turn

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
and this is your mic so you can turn

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.120 
and this is your mic so you can turn
that<00:03:22.720> up<00:03:22.960> and<00:03:23.620> down<00:03:24.190> so<00:03:24.850> this<00:03:25.300> does<00:03:25.840> work<00:03:26.320> as<00:03:26.590> a

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
that up and down so this does work as a

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.400 
that up and down so this does work as a
broadcast<00:03:27.940> platform<00:03:28.570> so<00:03:28.720> you<00:03:28.810> can<00:03:28.840> see<00:03:29.110> I<00:03:29.140> have

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
broadcast platform so you can see I have

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.730 
broadcast platform so you can see I have
twitch<00:03:29.860> and<00:03:30.160> a<00:03:30.280> few<00:03:30.730> rtmp<00:03:31.600> servers<00:03:32.080> in<00:03:32.260> my

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
twitch and a few rtmp servers in my

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.890 
twitch and a few rtmp servers in my
broadcast<00:03:33.370> but<00:03:33.640> I<00:03:33.670> also<00:03:33.850> have<00:03:34.090> a<00:03:34.300> local

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.190 
broadcast but I also have a local
recording<00:03:35.860> option<00:03:36.430> so<00:03:36.730> yes<00:03:37.090> this<00:03:37.600> can<00:03:37.840> be<00:03:37.960> used

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
recording option so yes this can be used

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.310 
recording option so yes this can be used
as<00:03:38.410> a<00:03:38.610> broadcast<00:03:39.610> program<00:03:40.360> as<00:03:40.540> well<00:03:40.990> as<00:03:41.290> a

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
as a broadcast program as well as a

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.950 
as a broadcast program as well as a
local<00:03:41.950> recording<00:03:42.640> program<00:03:43.030> and<00:03:43.270> it<00:03:43.780> goes

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:43.960 
local recording program and it goes

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.060 
local recording program and it goes
ahead<00:03:44.110> and<00:03:44.260> outputs<00:03:44.980> at<00:03:45.190> a<00:03:45.570> dot<00:03:46.570> 2-6<00:03:47.500> for

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
ahead and outputs at a dot 2-6 for

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.760 
ahead and outputs at a dot 2-6 for
encoding<00:03:49.060> which<00:03:49.240> is<00:03:49.420> pretty<00:03:49.750> nice<00:03:49.930> that's<00:03:50.650> a

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
encoding which is pretty nice that's a
