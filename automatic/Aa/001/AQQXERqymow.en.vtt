things is a great start but actually you

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.179 
things is a great start but actually you
need<00:02:35.799> to<00:02:36.129> phone<00:02:36.700> up<00:02:36.939> you<00:02:37.150> need<00:02:37.330> to<00:02:37.980> bully<00:02:38.980> and

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
and we've been quite successful in a in

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.350 
and we've been quite successful in a in
a<00:02:44.019> brief<00:02:44.230> way<00:02:44.500> in<00:02:45.310> a<00:02:45.370> starting<00:02:46.060> way<00:02:46.180> and

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
a brief way in a starting way and

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.820 
a brief way in a starting way and
getting<00:02:46.569> those<00:02:46.659> things<00:02:46.959> going<00:02:47.349> but

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
getting those things going but

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.910 
getting those things going but
undoubtedly<00:02:48.400> I<00:02:48.519> think<00:02:48.939> we<00:02:49.629> need<00:02:49.840> more

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
undoubtedly I think we need more

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.250 
undoubtedly I think we need more
activity<00:02:50.920> of<00:02:51.730> this<00:02:51.909> kind<00:02:52.269> in<00:02:52.689> the<00:02:52.840> arts<00:02:53.140> and

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
activity of this kind in the arts and

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.199 
activity of this kind in the arts and
humanities<00:02:53.830> and<00:02:54.099> I<00:02:54.580> would<00:02:54.760> encourage<00:02:55.030> people

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
humanities and I would encourage people

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.330 
humanities and I would encourage people
to<00:02:55.540> take<00:02:55.780> a<00:02:55.840> look<00:02:55.989> at<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.739> history<00:02:56.980> policy

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
to take a look at the history policy

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.000 
to take a look at the history policy
website<00:02:57.610> and<00:02:58.180> think<00:02:58.720> about<00:02:59.049> what<00:02:59.470> in<00:02:59.739> their

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
website and think about what in their

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.770 
website and think about what in their
own<00:03:00.159> disciplinary<00:03:00.730> field<00:03:01.150> they<00:03:01.510> might

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
own disciplinary field they might

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.710 
own disciplinary field they might
perhaps<00:03:02.110> be<00:03:02.379> able<00:03:02.769> to<00:03:02.950> do<00:03:03.549> in<00:03:03.879> emulating<00:03:04.540> this

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
perhaps be able to do in emulating this

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.309 
perhaps be able to do in emulating this
kind<00:03:05.049> of<00:03:05.170> activity<00:03:06.239> it's<00:03:07.239> a<00:03:07.420> it's<00:03:07.900> not<00:03:08.079> easy

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
kind of activity it's a it's not easy

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.589 
kind of activity it's a it's not easy
and<00:03:09.159> we're<00:03:09.430> feeling<00:03:09.640> tropical<00:03:09.879> ii<00:03:10.120> funded<00:03:10.480> and

we spend a good deal of our time chasing

we spend a good deal of our time chasing

of my brief talk giving you a flavor of

of my brief talk giving you a flavor of

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
is in this field that I work in economic

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.160 
is in this field that I work in economic
social<00:03:26.980> cultural<00:03:27.700> history<00:03:28.120> a<00:03:28.299> couple<00:03:29.079> of

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
social cultural history a couple of

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.140 
social cultural history a couple of
examples<00:03:29.739> perhaps<00:03:29.980> of<00:03:30.430> the<00:03:30.549> ways<00:03:30.730> in<00:03:31.120> which

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
examples perhaps of the ways in which

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.110 
examples perhaps of the ways in which
this<00:03:31.599> dialogue<00:03:32.349> with<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:32.650> past<00:03:32.950> I<00:03:33.340> think<00:03:33.730> can

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
this dialogue with the past I think can

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.569 
this dialogue with the past I think can
be<00:03:34.299> quite<00:03:35.170> unequivocally<00:03:35.980> said<00:03:36.219> to<00:03:36.400> have

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
be quite unequivocally said to have

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:39.660 
be quite unequivocally said to have
really<00:03:37.329> fundamentally<00:03:38.019> transformed<00:03:38.860> how<00:03:39.610> we

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
really fundamentally transformed how we

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.530 
really fundamentally transformed how we
and<00:03:40.480> even<00:03:40.719> policymakers<00:03:41.709> I<00:03:41.739> noticed<00:03:42.450> some<00:03:43.450> of

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
and even policymakers I noticed some of

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.610 
and even policymakers I noticed some of
what<00:03:43.659> I'm<00:03:43.780> going<00:03:43.900> to<00:03:43.989> say<00:03:44.170> is<00:03:44.319> actually

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
what I'm going to say is actually
