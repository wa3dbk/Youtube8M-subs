00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.950
 DEA 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:09.540
 It is Yuki Nakayama of Dentsu 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:15.269
 We Japanese people are very serious 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:17.450
 Then it's too serious to zoom in to make the earthquake recognize the value of your work 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:24.520
 I'm calling 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:24.520
 Today I will tell you five tips for not doing so in Cannes 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:32.970
 There are 3 works that I want to enter 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:38.000
 Level is assumed to be Vince members 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:42.230
 work of c level will not be winning the wrong Let's give up entry 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.500
 Judging is the task of quickly selecting the work to be dropped 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:50.700
 There is no need for three more entries 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:54.540
 it is advantageous to entry the work of a level into three categories 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:58.579
 Recruitment category of feeling is changing every year 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:02.589
 There are two new categories in 2012 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.589
 Read the latest recruitment essentials 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.659
 Use English native copywriters when making catchphrases and strong English sentences 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:17.620
 Let's borrow it 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:23.400
 Will affect is actually examination clarity Toka simplicity of the words English to become a scale 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:27.580
 I translated Japanese into Japanese but I can not find it in English in jury 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:32.230
 On the other hand, more than two thirds of the earthquake is not native English 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:35.580
 So , speaking in toeic, the amount of characters or speed that people can read about 700 points 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.580
 What if you try to 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.990
 In the category of integrated campaigns 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:47.860
 The quality of the entry video greatly affects the winning probability 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:54.140
 For example, when entering the same work in multiple divisions 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:59.200
 If it is the outdoors, it is effective to change the video editing to the characteristics of the outdoors 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:02.369
 Let's look at this and Kimura's clip for how to make entry 3 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.369
 It will be very helpful 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:14.460
 When you need to explain about cultural background, cherry blossoms , conditions, etc. 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:17.069
 It is effective to put an English ticker of 3 to 5 seconds in front of the TV cm main part 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:22.069
 If there is a brief explanation at the beginning 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.069
 I feel relieved to the earthquake and will go into the details of the work 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.520
 Radio cm is a Japanese original recording board 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.760
 a more than just script 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:38.930
 It is advantageous to keep the English recording board together with salt 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:43.959
 The jury is the most likely to own country language and non-English gibberish 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.959
 At that time , it will be helpful if there is an English version of the audio 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:52.140
 It is most important to make a good work 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.830
 But to get the work evaluated 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.990
 Let's sweat a little more when applying 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:02.190
 Everybody is on the platform of management 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.190
