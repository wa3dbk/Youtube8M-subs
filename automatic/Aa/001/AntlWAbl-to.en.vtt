welcome<00:00:13.160> back<00:00:13.309> we'll<00:00:13.910> finish<00:00:14.119> with<00:00:14.269> levels

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
welcome back we'll finish with levels

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.740 
welcome back we'll finish with levels
and<00:00:14.990> then<00:00:15.259> get<00:00:15.440> on<00:00:15.469> with<00:00:15.769> the<00:00:15.889> curves<00:00:16.689> now<00:00:17.689> the

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
and then get on with the curves now the

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.480 
levels didn't require a lot of work

intent from Camera Raw because in Camera
Raw<00:00:42.589> we<00:00:43.370> were<00:00:43.489> more<00:00:43.670> concerned<00:00:43.879> about

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
Raw we were more concerned about

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.209 
Raw we were more concerned about
minimizing<00:00:44.840> clipping<00:00:45.530> even<00:00:45.980> at<00:00:46.100> the<00:00:46.190> expense

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
of the image being a little off

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.250 
of the image being a little off
temperature-wise<00:00:48.860> so<00:00:49.430> this<00:00:50.180> is<00:00:50.359> why<00:00:50.480> you<00:00:50.539> fix

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
temperature-wise so this is why you fix

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.020 
temperature-wise so this is why you fix
that<00:00:51.440> with<00:00:51.620> in<00:00:51.770> here<00:00:51.980> and<00:00:52.129> just<00:00:52.280> remember<00:00:52.579> the

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
that with in here and just remember the

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.000 
that with in here and just remember the
red<00:00:53.239> and<00:00:53.390> blue<00:00:53.629> are<00:00:54.230> equivalent<00:00:54.920> to

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
red and blue are equivalent to

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.330 
red and blue are equivalent to
temperature<00:00:55.640> and<00:00:55.879> the<00:00:56.390> green<00:00:56.660> channel<00:00:57.019> is

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
temperature and the green channel is

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.119 
temperature and the green channel is
equivalent<00:00:58.340> to<00:00:58.399> tint<00:00:58.760> in<00:00:58.969> the<00:00:59.739> RGB<00:01:00.739> channel

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
equivalent to tint in the RGB channel

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:02.979 
equivalent to tint in the RGB channel
you<00:01:01.280> just<00:01:01.489> use<00:01:01.640> the<00:01:01.820> center<00:01:02.210> slider<00:01:02.510> to<00:01:02.840> make

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
you just use the center slider to make

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.410 
you just use the center slider to make
any<00:01:03.199> brightness<00:01:03.859> adjustments<00:01:04.580> and<00:01:04.729> because

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
any brightness adjustments and because

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.200 
any brightness adjustments and because
of<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:05.869> inner<00:01:06.200> connectedness<00:01:06.979> of<00:01:07.490> the<00:01:07.940> curves

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.710 

well<00:01:16.250> I<00:01:16.280> like<00:01:16.580> what<00:01:16.819> we<00:01:16.970> got<00:01:17.179> so<00:01:17.390> we'll<00:01:17.539> close

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
well I like what we got so we'll close

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.650 
well I like what we got so we'll close
it<00:01:17.780> for<00:01:17.959> now<00:01:18.259> and<00:01:19.270> open<00:01:20.270> up<00:01:20.330> the<00:01:20.390> curves<00:01:22.539> now<00:01:23.539> as

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
it for now and open up the curves now as

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.770 
it for now and open up the curves now as
you<00:01:23.690> remember<00:01:24.229> we<00:01:24.380> use<00:01:24.950> that<00:01:25.160> unsharp<00:01:25.729> mask<00:01:25.970> to

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
you remember we use that unsharp mask to

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.540 
you remember we use that unsharp mask to
put<00:01:27.020> a<00:01:27.050> certain<00:01:27.289> amount<00:01:27.440> of<00:01:27.679> contrast<00:01:28.130> in<00:01:28.399> our

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
put a certain amount of contrast in our

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.600 
put a certain amount of contrast in our
image<00:01:29.140> but<00:01:30.140> we<00:01:30.259> left<00:01:30.500> a<00:01:30.649> little<00:01:30.800> bit<00:01:31.009> for<00:01:31.580> the

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
image but we left a little bit for the

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.370 
image but we left a little bit for the
curves<00:01:31.880> to<00:01:32.090> pick<00:01:32.300> up<00:01:32.479> the<00:01:32.929> two<00:01:33.110> of<00:01:33.229> them

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
curves to pick up the two of them

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.080 
curves to pick up the two of them
together<00:01:33.560> work<00:01:34.039> real<00:01:34.280> nice<00:01:34.489> to<00:01:34.729> get<00:01:34.880> your

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
together work real nice to get your

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.330 
together work real nice to get your
contrast<00:01:35.569> right<00:01:35.869> if<00:01:36.530> you<00:01:36.649> try<00:01:36.830> to<00:01:36.890> do<00:01:37.069> it<00:01:37.190> all

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
contrast right if you try to do it all

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.070 
contrast right if you try to do it all
with<00:01:37.550> the<00:01:37.640> unsharp<00:01:38.060> mask<00:01:38.300> you'll<00:01:38.630> see<00:01:38.899> those

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
with the unsharp mask you'll see those

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.589 
with the unsharp mask you'll see those
halos<00:01:39.500> around<00:01:39.560> things<00:01:40.220> so<00:01:40.489> we<00:01:41.149> kind<00:01:41.390> of<00:01:41.420> let

00:01:41.589 --> 00:01:41.599 
halos around things so we kind of let

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:44.139 
halos around things so we kind of let
this<00:01:41.810> curves<00:01:42.200> pick<00:01:42.500> up<00:01:42.679> part<00:01:42.920> of<00:01:43.009> the<00:01:43.099> load<00:01:43.310> now

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
this curves pick up part of the load now

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:45.969 
this curves pick up part of the load now
the<00:01:44.599> curves<00:01:44.840> dialog<00:01:45.289> is<00:01:45.500> not<00:01:45.679> hard<00:01:45.920> to

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
the curves dialog is not hard to

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:47.529 
the curves dialog is not hard to
understand<00:01:46.489> if<00:01:46.640> you<00:01:46.729> just<00:01:46.910> keep<00:01:47.060> in<00:01:47.209> mind<00:01:47.420> that

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
understand if you just keep in mind that

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:50.080 
understand if you just keep in mind that

so<00:02:04.369> with<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.239> bow<00:02:05.390> and<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:05.629> curve<00:02:05.899> you<00:02:06.080> can

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
so with the bow and the curve you can

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:07.600 
so with the bow and the curve you can
see<00:02:06.410> that<00:02:06.440> our<00:02:06.679> mid<00:02:06.830> tones<00:02:07.099> are<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.429> least

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
see that our mid tones are the least

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.760 
see that our mid tones are the least
affected<00:02:08.239> right<00:02:08.780> here<00:02:09.050> it's<00:02:09.200> affected<00:02:09.679> the

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
affected right here it's affected the

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.979 
affected right here it's affected the
most<00:02:09.950> and<00:02:10.310> then<00:02:10.729> it<00:02:10.879> tapers<00:02:11.090> on<00:02:11.510> until<00:02:11.959> it

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
most and then it tapers on until it

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.960 
most and then it tapers on until it
until<00:02:12.860> it's<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.160> same<00:02:13.400> and<00:02:13.610> hasn't<00:02:13.910> been

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
until it's the same and hasn't been

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.070 
until it's the same and hasn't been
affected<00:02:14.209> in<00:02:14.540> that<00:02:15.140> point<00:02:15.440> being<00:02:16.129> stuck<00:02:16.520> there

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
affected in that point being stuck there

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.259 
affected in that point being stuck there
prevents<00:02:18.080> clipping<00:02:18.549> now<00:02:19.549> the<00:02:19.609> problem<00:02:19.909> is<00:02:20.209> you

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
prevents clipping now the problem is you

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.390 
prevents clipping now the problem is you
remember<00:02:20.719> in<00:02:20.840> Camera<00:02:21.230> Raw<00:02:21.379> and<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.950> reason<00:02:22.280> we

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
remember in Camera Raw and the reason we

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.360 
remember in Camera Raw and the reason we
kept<00:02:22.849> that<00:02:23.239> curve<00:02:23.870> set<00:02:24.200> to<00:02:24.349> linear

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
kept that curve set to linear

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.970 
kept that curve set to linear
is<00:02:25.430> here<00:02:25.909> I<00:02:25.940> can<00:02:26.269> I<00:02:26.480> can<00:02:27.110> actually<00:02:27.560> increase

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
is here I can I can actually increase

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.089 
is here I can I can actually increase
the<00:02:28.659> contrast<00:02:29.659> with<00:02:30.140> no<00:02:30.290> clipping<00:02:30.560> see<00:02:30.890> up<00:02:31.010> in

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
the contrast with no clipping see up in

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.789 
the contrast with no clipping see up in
the<00:02:31.220> histogram<00:02:31.489> up<00:02:31.879> here<00:02:32.170> but<00:02:33.170> in<00:02:33.290> Camera<00:02:33.620> Raw

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
the histogram up here but in Camera Raw

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.430 
the histogram up here but in Camera Raw
if<00:02:34.099> you<00:02:34.220> put<00:02:34.489> much<00:02:34.700> curve<00:02:35.060> in<00:02:35.239> there<00:02:35.510> you<00:02:36.110> start

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
if you put much curve in there you start

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.300 
if you put much curve in there you start
to<00:02:36.560> introduce<00:02:36.950> clipping<00:02:38.170> so<00:02:39.170> anyway<00:02:39.500> let<00:02:40.220> me

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
to introduce clipping so anyway let me

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.490 
to introduce clipping so anyway let me
drag<00:02:40.580> these<00:02:40.790> points<00:02:41.180> away<00:02:41.450> and<00:02:41.750> now<00:02:41.930> visually

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
drag these points away and now visually

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.119 
drag these points away and now visually
we'll<00:02:43.310> just<00:02:43.579> get<00:02:44.329> this<00:02:44.510> thing<00:02:44.750> a<00:02:44.870> little<00:02:45.140> put<00:02:46.099> a

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
we'll just get this thing a little put a

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:47.860 
we'll just get this thing a little put a
little<00:02:46.280> more<00:02:46.430> contrast<00:02:46.819> notice<00:02:47.659> how<00:02:47.810> the

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
little more contrast notice how the

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.899 
little more contrast notice how the
image<00:02:48.110> appears<00:02:48.620> to<00:02:48.769> be<00:02:48.890> more<00:02:49.069> saturated<00:02:49.670> in

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:49.909 
image appears to be more saturated in

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:53.259 
image appears to be more saturated in
color<00:02:50.230> now<00:02:51.230> visually<00:02:51.799> I<00:02:51.829> like<00:02:52.190> that<00:02:52.400> but<00:02:53.120> we've

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
color now visually I like that but we've

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.240 
color now visually I like that but we've
got<00:02:53.480> our<00:02:53.629> human<00:02:53.930> saturation<00:02:54.709> adjustment

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
got our human saturation adjustment

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.089 
got our human saturation adjustment
layer<00:02:55.909> down<00:02:56.180> here<00:02:56.629> that<00:02:57.110> can<00:02:57.290> do<00:02:57.410> this<00:02:57.620> with

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
layer down here that can do this with

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.170 
layer down here that can do this with
much<00:02:58.370> more<00:02:58.579> fine<00:02:58.879> tuning<00:02:58.910> I<00:02:59.540> don't<00:03:00.170> want<00:03:00.410> any

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
much more fine tuning I don't want any

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.150 
much more fine tuning I don't want any
additional<00:03:02.440> saturation<00:03:03.440> being<00:03:03.709> introduced

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
additional saturation being introduced

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.949 
additional saturation being introduced
with<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.370> curb<00:03:04.670> so<00:03:04.879> you<00:03:04.970> can<00:03:05.180> avoid<00:03:05.269> that<00:03:05.690> by

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
with the curb so you can avoid that by

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.289 
with the curb so you can avoid that by
setting<00:03:06.379> the<00:03:06.590> blending<00:03:06.980> mode<00:03:07.010> of<00:03:07.310> curves<00:03:07.640> to

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
setting the blending mode of curves to

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.869 
setting the blending mode of curves to
luminosity<00:03:08.720> now<00:03:09.170> watch<00:03:09.379> the<00:03:09.620> saturation<00:03:10.609> drop

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 
luminosity now watch the saturation drop

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:15.369 
luminosity now watch the saturation drop
when<00:03:11.060> I<00:03:11.090> click<00:03:11.390> this<00:03:12.459> there<00:03:13.459> you<00:03:13.670> go<00:03:14.170> so<00:03:15.170> if<00:03:15.290> you

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
when I click this there you go so if you

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:16.750 
when I click this there you go so if you
keep<00:03:15.590> your<00:03:15.769> blending<00:03:16.220> mode<00:03:16.370> set<00:03:16.609> to

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
keep your blending mode set to

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.000 
keep your blending mode set to
luminosity<00:03:17.260> it<00:03:18.260> allows<00:03:18.560> you<00:03:18.739> to<00:03:18.829> keep

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
luminosity it allows you to keep

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.670 
luminosity it allows you to keep
everything<00:03:19.310> compartmentalized<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:20.680> just

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
everything compartmentalized and just

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.979 
everything compartmentalized and just
use<00:03:21.890> the<00:03:22.099> curves<00:03:22.340> to<00:03:22.549> only<00:03:22.730> affect<00:03:23.450> the

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
use the curves to only affect the

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.449 
use the curves to only affect the
contrast<00:03:24.530> so<00:03:24.709> let's<00:03:24.920> do<00:03:25.069> that<00:03:25.220> right<00:03:25.430> now<00:03:27.459> so

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
contrast so let's do that right now so

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.150 
contrast so let's do that right now so
you<00:03:28.549> can<00:03:28.760> visually<00:03:29.239> just<00:03:29.389> drag<00:03:29.870> it<00:03:29.980> you<00:03:30.980> can

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
you can visually just drag it you can

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.250 
you can visually just drag it you can
put<00:03:31.370> a<00:03:31.400> point<00:03:31.760> up<00:03:31.970> here<00:03:32.030> and<00:03:32.599> drag<00:03:32.780> it<00:03:32.989> north

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
put a point up here and drag it north

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.409 
put a point up here and drag it north
but<00:03:33.500> in<00:03:33.799> my<00:03:34.099> experience<00:03:34.220> I've<00:03:34.819> found<00:03:34.849> that

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:35.419 
but in my experience I've found that

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:37.990 
but in my experience I've found that
because<00:03:36.230> of<00:03:36.440> the<00:03:36.470> the<00:03:37.220> way<00:03:37.370> that<00:03:37.639> the<00:03:37.730> shadow

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
because of the the way that the shadow

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.289 
because of the the way that the shadow
highlight<00:03:38.660> in<00:03:38.870> an<00:03:38.989> unsharp<00:03:39.470> mask<00:03:40.299> processes

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299

the<00:03:41.569> image<00:03:42.470> early<00:03:42.799> on<00:03:42.980> that<00:03:43.879> about<00:03:44.359> all<00:03:44.569> you'll

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
the image early on that about all you'll

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.869 
the image early on that about all you'll
wind<00:03:44.989> up<00:03:45.139> doing<00:03:45.349> in<00:03:45.620> this<00:03:45.739> curves<00:03:46.099> is<00:03:46.430> putting

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 
wind up doing in this curves is putting

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:49.390 
wind up doing in this curves is putting
one<00:03:47.090> point<00:03:47.419> about<00:03:48.290> here<00:03:48.680> and<00:03:48.859> dragging<00:03:49.310> it

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
one point about here and dragging it

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.759 
one point about here and dragging it
south<00:03:49.669> a<00:03:49.700> little<00:03:50.090> bit<00:03:51.190> until<00:03:52.480> the<00:03:53.560> just<00:03:54.560> until

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
south a little bit until the just until

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.030 
south a little bit until the just until
you<00:03:55.010> get<00:03:55.310> a<00:03:55.340> little<00:03:55.579> bit<00:03:55.730> more<00:03:55.879> contrast<00:03:56.359> if

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
you get a little bit more contrast if

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.379 
you get a little bit more contrast if
you<00:03:58.040> need<00:03:58.220> a<00:03:58.250> little<00:03:58.459> more<00:03:58.609> pop<00:03:58.879> in<00:03:59.060> the<00:03:59.180> lights

00:03:59.379 --> 00:03:59.389 
you need a little more pop in the lights

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:01.000 
you need a little more pop in the lights
well<00:03:59.629> you<00:04:00.049> could<00:04:00.230> bring<00:04:00.410> that<00:04:00.590> up<00:04:00.620> a<00:04:00.859> little

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
well you could bring that up a little

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.830 
well you could bring that up a little
bit<00:04:01.250> but<00:04:01.519> you<00:04:01.669> can<00:04:01.849> see<00:04:02.090> by<00:04:02.269> the<00:04:02.329> time<00:04:02.629> you

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
bit but you can see by the time you

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.110 
bit but you can see by the time you
visually<00:04:03.650> you<00:04:03.799> notice<00:04:04.099> much<00:04:04.340> going<00:04:04.699> on<00:04:04.849> it's

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
visually you notice much going on it's

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.530 
visually you notice much going on it's
starting<00:04:05.660> to<00:04:05.750> look<00:04:05.780> a<00:04:05.989> little<00:04:06.109> messed<00:04:06.379> up<00:04:06.560> so

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
starting to look a little messed up so

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.909 
starting to look a little messed up so
experiment<00:04:08.540> around<00:04:08.629> with<00:04:08.989> it<00:04:09.169> but<00:04:09.410> I<00:04:09.620> think

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:09.919 
experiment around with it but I think

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:12.430 
experiment around with it but I think
you'll<00:04:10.069> find<00:04:10.099> that<00:04:10.690> just<00:04:11.690> a<00:04:11.870> little<00:04:12.169> dip<00:04:12.410> in

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
you'll find that just a little dip in

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.530 
you'll find that just a little dip in
the<00:04:12.709> curve<00:04:13.190> here<00:04:13.639> is<00:04:13.760> about<00:04:14.000> all<00:04:14.180> it<00:04:14.389> will<00:04:14.480> take

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
the curve here is about all it will take

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.020 
the curve here is about all it will take
if<00:04:14.959> you<00:04:15.739> really<00:04:15.949> want<00:04:16.250> to<00:04:16.340> push<00:04:16.489> your<00:04:16.729> dark

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
if you really want to push your dark

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.270 
if you really want to push your dark
star<00:04:17.419> you<00:04:17.720> can<00:04:17.930> put<00:04:18.109> one<00:04:18.410> more<00:04:18.620> point<00:04:18.859> kind<00:04:19.190> of

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
star you can put one more point kind of

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.310 
star you can put one more point kind of
down<00:04:19.459> here<00:04:19.789> send<00:04:20.359> it<00:04:20.479> a<00:04:20.539> little<00:04:20.570> farther<00:04:20.959> south

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
down here send it a little farther south

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.439 
down here send it a little farther south
let's<00:04:21.590> zoom<00:04:21.829> in<00:04:22.010> on<00:04:22.190> here<00:04:22.520> so<00:04:23.210> you<00:04:23.270> can<00:04:23.419> see

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:23.449 
let's zoom in on here so you can see

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:28.990 
let's zoom in on here so you can see
what's<00:04:23.870> going<00:04:24.139> on<00:04:27.190> let's<00:04:28.190> get<00:04:28.430> here<00:04:28.699> and<00:04:28.820> bring

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
what's going on let's get here and bring

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.730 
what's going on let's get here and bring
this<00:04:29.150> there's<00:04:29.599> some<00:04:29.810> darks<00:04:30.139> here<00:04:30.320> let's<00:04:30.530> bring

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
this there's some darks here let's bring

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.740 
this there's some darks here let's bring
this<00:04:30.860> curve<00:04:31.160> up<00:04:31.370> and<00:04:33.909> let's<00:04:34.909> get<00:04:35.090> things<00:04:35.300> dark

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
this curve up and let's get things dark

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.570 
this curve up and let's get things dark
and<00:04:36.229> if<00:04:36.380> you<00:04:36.500> take<00:04:36.710> these<00:04:37.039> would<00:04:37.250> be<00:04:37.370> even

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
and if you take these would be even

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.220 
and if you take these would be even
darker<00:04:37.940> errors<00:04:38.180> if<00:04:38.360> you<00:04:38.450> want<00:04:38.630> to<00:04:38.719> send<00:04:38.930> it

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
darker errors if you want to send it

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.080 
darker errors if you want to send it
a<00:04:39.290> little<00:04:39.710> bit<00:04:39.860> they'll<00:04:40.070> get<00:04:40.280> slightly<00:04:40.580> darker

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
a little bit they'll get slightly darker

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.320 
a little bit they'll get slightly darker
but<00:04:41.380> I<00:04:42.380> think<00:04:43.370> you'll<00:04:43.490> find<00:04:43.520> something<00:04:43.850> about

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
but I think you'll find something about

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.990 
but I think you'll find something about
that<00:04:44.570> will<00:04:44.930> do<00:04:45.110> it<00:04:45.290> be<00:04:46.280> sufficient<00:04:46.850> and

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
that will do it be sufficient and

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.770 
that will do it be sufficient and
there's<00:04:47.930> our<00:04:48.080> image<00:04:48.410> so<00:04:48.620> far<00:04:48.920> in<00:04:49.510> the<00:04:50.510> next

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
there's our image so far in the next

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.480 
there's our image so far in the next
segment<00:04:50.930> we'll<00:04:51.590> deal<00:04:51.920> with<00:04:51.950> a<00:04:52.130> human

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
segment we'll deal with a human

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.240 
segment we'll deal with a human
