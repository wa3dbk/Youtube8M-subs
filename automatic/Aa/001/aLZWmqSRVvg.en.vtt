tractor<00:04:37.970> into<00:04:38.300> Egypt<00:04:38.890> because<00:04:39.890> they<00:04:40.130> couldn't

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
tractor into Egypt because they couldn't

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.770

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
travelling they'd never had it before so

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.900 
travelling they'd never had it before so
it<00:04:44.150> must<00:04:44.330> be<00:04:44.390> impossible<00:04:45.130> and<00:04:46.130> I<00:04:46.490> was<00:04:46.670> stuck
