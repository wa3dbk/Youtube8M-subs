we<00:00:01.290> had<00:00:01.410> a<00:00:01.439> free<00:00:01.920> scale<00:00:02.190> here<00:00:02.460> at<00:00:02.580> computex

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
we had a free scale here at computex

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.220 
we had a free scale here at computex
2011<00:00:04.110> this<00:00:05.100> is<00:00:05.250> a<00:00:05.279> special<00:00:05.549> ereader<00:00:06.230> that's

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
2011 this is a special ereader that's

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.110 
2011 this is a special ereader that's
right<00:00:07.529> this<00:00:07.770> is<00:00:07.830> actually<00:00:08.309> a<00:00:08.340> demo<00:00:08.670> unit

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
right this is actually a demo unit

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.419 
right this is actually a demo unit
produced<00:00:09.480> by<00:00:09.719> Tyco<00:00:10.260> Electronics<00:00:10.290> to<00:00:11.190> prove

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
produced by Tyco Electronics to prove

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.879 
produced by Tyco Electronics to prove
out<00:00:11.580> some<00:00:11.910> new<00:00:12.059> touch<00:00:12.389> technology<00:00:13.200> called

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
out some new touch technology called

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.779 
out some new touch technology called
acoustic<00:00:14.700> pulse<00:00:15.059> recognition<00:00:15.990> or<00:00:16.109> APR

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:16.789 
acoustic pulse recognition or APR

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.390 
acoustic pulse recognition or APR
technology<00:00:17.789> so<00:00:18.600> what<00:00:18.750> we<00:00:18.900> have<00:00:19.080> here<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.619> a

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
technology so what we have here is a

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.700 
technology so what we have here is a
touchscreen<00:00:20.880> where<00:00:21.630> there's<00:00:21.810> no<00:00:22.050> overlay

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
touchscreen where there's no overlay

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.370 
touchscreen where there's no overlay
it's<00:00:23.340> actually<00:00:23.609> listening<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.140> top<00:00:25.350> of

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
it's actually listening to the top of

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.980 
it's actually listening to the top of
the<00:00:25.619> screen<00:00:25.830> so<00:00:26.730> we<00:00:26.849> have<00:00:27.029> little<00:00:27.330> microphones

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
the screen so we have little microphones

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.970 
the screen so we have little microphones
in<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.410> bezel<00:00:29.160> that<00:00:29.340> allows<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.740> system<00:00:31.740> to

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
in the bezel that allows the system to

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.360 
in the bezel that allows the system to
listen<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:33.059> my<00:00:33.210> gestures<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.230> I'm<00:00:35.070> able<00:00:35.280> to

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
listen to my gestures and I'm able to

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.340 
listen to my gestures and I'm able to
manipulate<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.390> advantage<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:37.050> there

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
manipulate that the advantage is there

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.979 
manipulate that the advantage is there
is<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.739> there's<00:00:37.950> no<00:00:38.010> overlay<00:00:38.820> on<00:00:39.120> top<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.899> the

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
is that there's no overlay on top of the

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.880 
is that there's no overlay on top of the
screen<00:00:40.200> so<00:00:41.190> there's<00:00:41.370> as<00:00:41.610> much<00:00:42.500> contrast<00:00:43.500> as

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
screen so there's as much contrast as

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.340 
screen so there's as much contrast as
possible<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:44.940> as<00:00:45.149> compared<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.840> resistive

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
possible so as compared to a resistive

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.880 
possible so as compared to a resistive

overlay in addition not demonstrated by
this<00:00:49.950> design<00:00:50.489> but<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.600> can<00:00:51.780> do<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.930> bevel<00:00:52.469> list

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
this design but you can do a bevel list

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.770 
this design but you can do a bevel list
design<00:00:53.280> where<00:00:53.789> there's<00:00:53.969> no<00:00:54.239> need<00:00:54.539> for

anything around the edges no need none

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.510 
anything around the edges no need none
eat<00:00:57.539> at<00:00:57.660> all<00:00:57.780> so<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.230> can<00:00:58.620> truly<00:00:58.980> do<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> new

been<00:01:10.049> like<00:01:10.200> on<00:01:10.530> top<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.860> being<00:01:11.040> what<00:01:11.549> we've

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
been like on top of being what we've

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.660 
been like on top of being what we've
seen<00:01:12.119> like<00:01:12.750> in<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.439> this<00:01:13.590> sony<00:01:13.920> reader<00:01:14.280> here

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
seen like in it this sony reader here

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.350 
seen like in it this sony reader here
there's<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.299> our<00:01:15.659> technology<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:17.360> that's

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
there's I our technology and that's

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.810 
there's I our technology and that's
proven<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.259> work<00:01:19.380> it's<00:01:19.680> on<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.860> market<00:01:20.009> so

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
proven to work it's on the market so

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.789 
proven to work it's on the market so
this<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.180> production<00:01:21.689> ready<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.350> be<00:01:22.530> razor

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
this is a production ready to be razor

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.700 
this is a production ready to be razor
with<00:01:23.220> ir<00:01:23.640> technology<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:24.600> absolutely<00:01:25.140> and

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
with ir technology so absolutely and

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.340 
with ir technology so absolutely and
there<00:01:26.280> they<00:01:26.310> have<00:01:26.610> some<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:27.390> are<00:01:27.869> all<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.259> way

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
there they have some I are all the way

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.819 
there they have some I are all the way
around<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.100> have<00:01:29.369> an<00:01:29.520> infrared<00:01:29.909> sensor

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
around so you have an infrared sensor

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:34.760 
around so you have an infrared sensor
that<00:01:31.829> you're<00:01:32.100> basically<00:01:33.200> breaking<00:01:34.200> when<00:01:34.710> you

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
that you're basically breaking when you

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.200 
that you're basically breaking when you
put<00:01:34.920> your<00:01:34.950> finger<00:01:35.220> down<00:01:35.520> in<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.850> XY

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
put your finger down in the XY

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.240 
put your finger down in the XY
coordinates<00:01:36.780> are<00:01:36.960> red<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.890> which<00:01:38.040> one<00:01:38.220> of

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
coordinates are red so which one of

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.429 
coordinates are red so which one of
these<00:01:38.460> two<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.850> best<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.869> all<00:01:40.020> depends<00:01:40.380> on

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
these two is the best it all depends on

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.560 
these two is the best it all depends on
what<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.680> want<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.920> do<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.400> think<00:01:42.030> for<00:01:42.210> simple

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
what you want to do I think for simple

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.469 
what you want to do I think for simple
gestures<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.290> control<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.369> APR<00:01:44.790> technology

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
gestures and control the APR technology

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.819 
gestures and control the APR technology
has<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.750> lot<00:01:46.020> for<00:01:46.619> more<00:01:46.829> precise<00:01:48.829> handwriting

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
has a lot for more precise handwriting

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.700 
has a lot for more precise handwriting
and<00:01:50.009> things<00:01:50.189> like<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.850> think<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.210> IR

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
and things like that I think the IR

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.190 
and things like that I think the IR
as<00:01:51.830> a<00:01:51.860> lot<00:01:52.100> so<00:01:52.610> is<00:01:52.850> there<00:01:53.420> is<00:01:53.570> some<00:01:53.810> of<00:01:53.900> what<00:01:54.020> to

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
as a lot so is there is some of what to

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.430 
as a lot so is there is some of what to
call<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:55.310> precision<00:01:55.850> is<00:01:56.060> a<00:01:56.450> little<00:01:57.170> bit<00:01:57.260> less

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
call the precision is a little bit less

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.859 
call the precision is a little bit less
here<00:01:57.710> so<00:01:58.010> I<00:01:58.100> think<00:01:58.549> they'll<00:01:59.000> work<00:01:59.240> on<00:01:59.510> it<00:01:59.659> to

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
here so I think they'll work on it to

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.690 
here so I think they'll work on it to
where<00:02:00.020> will<00:02:00.260> be<00:02:00.290> very<00:02:00.619> similar<00:02:00.950> to<00:02:01.190> I<00:02:01.400> our

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
where will be very similar to I our

fx35 processor and then you won the new
one<00:02:49.430> actually<00:02:49.940> I<00:02:49.970> think<00:02:50.060> has<00:02:50.390> been<00:02:50.630> torn<00:02:50.959> down

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050

developing<00:03:06.260> with<00:03:06.440> Android<00:03:06.829> right<00:03:07.100> now<00:03:07.280> so

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
developing with Android right now so

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.190 
developing with Android right now so
what<00:03:07.940> what<00:03:08.329> did<00:03:08.450> you<00:03:08.480> do<00:03:08.660> with<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:08.810> Android

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
what what did you do with the Android

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.380 
what what did you do with the Android
it's<00:03:09.590> not<00:03:09.739> the<00:03:09.890> normal<00:03:10.250> Android<00:03:10.579> I<00:03:10.700> think<00:03:11.209> it's

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
it's not the normal Android I think it's

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.259 
it's not the normal Android I think it's
it's<00:03:12.079> just<00:03:12.200> similar<00:03:13.010> to<00:03:13.489> the<00:03:13.790> barnes<00:03:14.120> and

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
it's just similar to the barnes and

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:15.789 
it's just similar to the barnes and
noble<00:03:14.480> know<00:03:14.630> which<00:03:15.019> is<00:03:15.170> on<00:03:15.320> the<00:03:15.410> market<00:03:15.560> right

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
noble know which is on the market right

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.370 
noble know which is on the market right
now<00:03:15.980> android<00:03:16.820> won't<00:03:17.090> necessarily<00:03:17.269> be<00:03:17.750> exposed

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
now android won't necessarily be exposed

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.949 
now android won't necessarily be exposed
but<00:03:19.280> android<00:03:19.730> is<00:03:19.850> so<00:03:20.000> popular<00:03:20.299> that<00:03:20.600> there<00:03:20.900> are

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
but android is so popular that there are

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.630 
but android is so popular that there are
a<00:03:20.989> lot<00:03:21.110> of<00:03:21.140> developers<00:03:21.739> available<00:03:22.340> to<00:03:22.459> use

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
a lot of developers available to use

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.490 
a lot of developers available to use
android<00:03:23.060> and<00:03:23.480> you<00:03:23.810> got<00:03:23.989> to<00:03:24.140> think<00:03:24.230> in<00:03:24.410> the

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
android and you got to think in the

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.530 
android and you got to think in the
future<00:03:24.530> you<00:03:25.070> might<00:03:25.220> open<00:03:25.549> an<00:03:25.790> e-reader<00:03:26.209> app

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
future you might open an e-reader app

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.590 
future you might open an e-reader app
store<00:03:26.930> that<00:03:27.470> could<00:03:27.650> be<00:03:27.910> used<00:03:28.910> on<00:03:29.209> an<00:03:29.329> e-reader

store that could be used on an e-reader

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.470 
store that could be used on an e-reader
