00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
design we're not actually carving out

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.880 
design we're not actually carving out
the<00:01:39.539> clay<00:01:39.750> you're<00:01:39.990> more<00:01:40.170> like<00:01:40.319> pressing<00:01:40.679> it

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
the clay you're more like pressing it

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.059 
the clay you're more like pressing it
around<00:01:41.990> right<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.200> here<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.410> am<00:01:43.500> just<00:01:43.860> trying<00:01:43.950> to

00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:44.069 
around right so here I am just trying to

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:46.490 
around right so here I am just trying to
get<00:01:44.190> the<00:01:44.340> shape<00:01:44.580> of<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.819> heart<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.390> then<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.350> can

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
get the shape of a heart and then I can

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.320 
get the shape of a heart and then I can
clean<00:01:46.709> it<00:01:46.740> up<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.069> little<00:01:47.280> after<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.940> get<00:01:48.090> the

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
clean it up a little after I get the

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.820 
clean it up a little after I get the
shape<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.929> know<00:01:49.190> but<00:01:51.110> this<00:01:52.110> seems<00:01:52.500> deep

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
shape you know but this seems deep

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.290 
shape you know but this seems deep
enough<00:01:53.160> and<00:01:53.340> I'll<00:01:53.429> I'll<00:01:53.670> turn<00:01:53.910> around<00:01:54.030> and

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
enough and I'll I'll turn around and

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.440 
enough and I'll I'll turn around and
show<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.479> after<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.429> carve<00:01:56.429> it<00:01:56.610> but<00:01:57.179> you<00:01:57.270> want

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.510 
show you after I carve it but you want
to<00:01:57.539> get<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:58.170> know<00:01:58.319> nice<00:01:58.740> before<00:01:59.220> you<00:01:59.369> go

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
to get it you know nice before you go

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.400 
to get it you know nice before you go
ahead<00:01:59.789> and<00:01:59.910> and<00:02:00.149> bake<00:02:00.750> this<00:02:01.020> because<00:02:01.259> we're

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
ahead and and bake this because we're

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.320 
ahead and and bake this because we're
gonna<00:02:01.500> bake<00:02:01.830> it<00:02:02.069> and<00:02:02.250> then<00:02:02.310> we're<00:02:02.910> gonna<00:02:02.970> fill

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
gonna bake it and then we're gonna fill

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.650 
gonna bake it and then we're gonna fill
in<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.630> shape<00:02:04.819> so<00:02:05.819> might<00:02:06.179> take<00:02:06.330> a<00:02:06.360> few<00:02:06.450> minutes

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
in the shape so might take a few minutes

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.529 
in the shape so might take a few minutes
you<00:02:07.200> know<00:02:07.319> take<00:02:07.649> your<00:02:07.770> time<00:02:08.009> with<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.759> try

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
you know take your time with it and try

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.800 
you know take your time with it and try
to<00:02:09.569> get<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.899> like<00:02:10.349> smooth<00:02:10.860> down<00:02:11.480> texture<00:02:12.480> of

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
to get it like smooth down texture of

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.320 
to get it like smooth down texture of
dots<00:02:13.260> or<00:02:13.680> something<00:02:14.040> around<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.400> edges<00:02:14.790> or

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
dots or something around the edges or

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.589 
dots or something around the edges or
anything<00:02:16.200> you<00:02:16.319> wanted<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:17.250> enhance<00:02:17.730> it

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
anything you wanted to to enhance it

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:19.640 
anything you wanted to to enhance it
before<00:02:19.050> you<00:02:19.230> make<00:02:19.410> it

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
before you make it

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.949 
before you make it
because<00:02:20.090> after<00:02:21.090> you<00:02:21.120> bake<00:02:21.390> it<00:02:21.569> you<00:02:21.660> have<00:02:21.810> to

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
because after you bake it you have to

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.630 
because after you bake it you have to
use<00:02:22.170> something<00:02:22.500> sharp<00:02:22.950> if<00:02:23.160> you<00:02:23.280> want<00:02:23.459> to<00:02:23.550> go

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
use something sharp if you want to go

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.979 
use something sharp if you want to go
back<00:02:23.819> and<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.830> wreak<00:02:25.830> our<00:02:26.040> Veni<00:02:26.280> thing

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
back and and wreak our Veni thing

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.740 
back and and wreak our Veni thing
it's<00:02:27.349> not<00:02:27.560> as<00:02:27.709> easy<00:02:27.859> right<00:02:28.849> it's<00:02:29.180> true<00:02:29.420> so<00:02:29.689> you

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
it's not as easy right it's true so you

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.569 
it's not as easy right it's true so you
want<00:02:30.079> to<00:02:30.170> plan<00:02:30.319> your<00:02:30.379> design<00:02:30.980> ahead<00:02:31.280> of<00:02:31.400> time

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:31.579 
want to plan your design ahead of time

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:36.039 
want to plan your design ahead of time
so<00:02:32.650> you<00:02:33.790> can<00:02:34.790> use<00:02:34.939> the<00:02:35.090> edge<00:02:35.209> of<00:02:35.359> your<00:02:35.450> blade<00:02:35.599> to

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
so you can use the edge of your blade to

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.520 
so you can use the edge of your blade to
kind<00:02:36.260> of<00:02:36.349> help<00:02:36.890> you<00:02:37.099> if<00:02:37.189> you<00:02:37.310> need<00:02:37.489> to<00:02:38.349> if<00:02:39.349> it's

it<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:42.069> and<00:02:43.069> these<00:02:43.430> stylists<00:02:44.150> come<00:02:44.359> in<00:02:44.480> a<00:02:44.569> bunch

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
it to and these stylists come in a bunch

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.330 
it to and these stylists come in a bunch
of<00:02:44.870> different<00:02:45.139> color<00:02:45.379> a<00:02:45.590> bunch<00:02:46.010> of<00:02:46.099> different

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
of different color a bunch of different

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.550 
of different color a bunch of different
sizes<00:02:46.519> not<00:02:46.909> Cutler's<00:02:47.389> but<00:02:48.230> a<00:02:48.260> bunch<00:02:48.500> of

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
sizes not Cutler's but a bunch of

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.670 
sizes not Cutler's but a bunch of
different<00:02:48.799> sizes<00:02:49.189> so<00:02:49.370> you<00:02:49.459> can<00:02:49.780> you<00:02:50.780> know<00:02:50.810> see

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
different sizes so you can you know see

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.289 
different sizes so you can you know see
which<00:02:51.829> size<00:02:52.099> will<00:02:52.340> work<00:02:52.370> best<00:02:52.790> for<00:02:52.939> whatever

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
which size will work best for whatever

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.629 
which size will work best for whatever
you<00:02:53.420> decide<00:02:53.810> you<00:02:54.019> want<00:02:54.170> to<00:02:54.260> do<00:02:54.469> so<00:02:55.310> here<00:02:55.459> I<00:02:55.519> have

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:55.639 
you decide you want to do so here I have

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:58.710 
you decide you want to do so here I have
a<00:02:56.060> start<00:02:56.959> of<00:02:57.079> a<00:02:57.139> heart<00:02:57.349> shape<00:02:57.650> pretty<00:02:57.950> much<00:02:58.159> and

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
a start of a heart shape pretty much and

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.679 
a start of a heart shape pretty much and
I<00:03:00.129> want<00:03:01.129> to<00:03:01.220> go<00:03:01.310> around<00:03:01.430> it<00:03:01.939> with<00:03:02.180> you<00:03:02.569> know

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:02.689 
I want to go around it with you know

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:04.390 
I want to go around it with you know
another<00:03:03.079> color<00:03:03.349> maybe<00:03:03.590> I'll<00:03:03.739> do<00:03:03.859> red<00:03:04.159> or

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
another color maybe I'll do red or

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.729 
another color maybe I'll do red or
something<00:03:04.849> I'll<00:03:05.030> have<00:03:05.060> to<00:03:05.209> decide<00:03:05.840> decide<00:03:06.200> you

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
something I'll have to decide decide you

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.979 
something I'll have to decide decide you
know<00:03:06.889> maybe<00:03:07.129> an<00:03:07.790> interference<00:03:08.510> color<00:03:08.810> would

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
know maybe an interference color would

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.349 
know maybe an interference color would
look<00:03:09.019> nice<00:03:09.489> but<00:03:10.489> here<00:03:11.030> so<00:03:11.719> I<00:03:11.750> have<00:03:11.989> this<00:03:12.169> like

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:13.359 
look nice but here so I have this like

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.569 
look nice but here so I have this like
little<00:03:14.359> space<00:03:14.659> around<00:03:15.019> it<00:03:15.379> and<00:03:15.680> all<00:03:16.310> this<00:03:16.430> can

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
little space around it and all this can

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.690 
little space around it and all this can
be<00:03:16.700> filled<00:03:16.939> with<00:03:17.060> liquid<00:03:17.299> clay<00:03:17.689> I<00:03:18.159> can<00:03:19.159> bake

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
be filled with liquid clay I can bake

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.129 
be filled with liquid clay I can bake
this<00:03:19.849> now<00:03:20.030> and<00:03:20.269> fill<00:03:20.419> it<00:03:20.510> with<00:03:20.599> liquid<00:03:20.750> clay

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:21.139 
this now and fill it with liquid clay

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:23.409 
this now and fill it with liquid clay
but<00:03:21.409> I<00:03:21.560> think<00:03:22.010> maybe<00:03:22.639> I'm<00:03:22.819> going<00:03:22.939> to<00:03:23.000> texture

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:23.419 
but I think maybe I'm going to texture

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:25.420 
but I think maybe I'm going to texture
the<00:03:23.569> middle<00:03:23.810> part<00:03:24.019> of<00:03:24.109> the<00:03:24.169> heart<00:03:24.439> by<00:03:24.950> using<00:03:25.310> my

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
the middle part of the heart by using my

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.000 
the middle part of the heart by using my
stylus<00:03:26.000> and<00:03:26.209> just<00:03:26.419> kind<00:03:26.689> of<00:03:26.780> going<00:03:27.620> around<00:03:27.739> in

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
stylus and just kind of going around in

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.330 
stylus and just kind of going around in
a<00:03:28.129> random<00:03:28.579> pattern<00:03:29.290> and<00:03:30.290> that<00:03:30.919> will<00:03:31.040> give<00:03:31.190> it<00:03:31.220> a

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
a random pattern and that will give it a

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.490 
a random pattern and that will give it a
little<00:03:31.489> extra<00:03:32.000> something<00:03:32.209> when<00:03:32.659> once<00:03:33.319> it's

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
little extra something when once it's

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.149 
little extra something when once it's
baked<00:03:33.739> it'll<00:03:34.040> look<00:03:34.159> cute<00:03:34.750> and<00:03:35.949> you<00:03:36.949> might

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:37.159 
baked it'll look cute and you might

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:38.949 
baked it'll look cute and you might
distort<00:03:37.519> it<00:03:37.669> a<00:03:37.699> little<00:03:37.879> so<00:03:38.060> use<00:03:38.599> your<00:03:38.780> stylus

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
distort it a little so use your stylus

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.550 
distort it a little so use your stylus
to<00:03:39.229> go<00:03:39.349> back<00:03:39.500> around<00:03:39.680> it<00:03:40.099> and<00:03:40.720> you<00:03:41.720> can<00:03:41.930> shape

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
to go back around it and you can shape

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.360 
to go back around it and you can shape
this<00:03:42.859> as<00:03:43.099> you<00:03:43.250> go<00:03:43.720> and<00:03:44.720> if<00:03:45.620> there's<00:03:45.829> any<00:03:46.010> crack

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
this as you go and if there's any crack

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.800 
this as you go and if there's any crack
so<00:03:46.729> you<00:03:46.819> want<00:03:47.000> to<00:03:47.090> make<00:03:47.269> sure<00:03:47.419> that<00:03:47.599> those<00:03:47.750> are

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
so you want to make sure that those are

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.990 
so you want to make sure that those are
taken<00:03:48.229> care<00:03:48.470> of<00:03:48.500> so<00:03:49.340> you<00:03:49.370> want<00:03:49.609> to<00:03:49.699> knead<00:03:49.849> your

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
taken care of so you want to knead your

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.149 
taken care of so you want to knead your
clay<00:03:50.209> pretty<00:03:50.479> good<00:03:50.720> before<00:03:51.349> starting<00:03:52.069> this

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:52.159 
clay pretty good before starting this

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:53.679 
clay pretty good before starting this
project<00:03:52.459> so<00:03:52.760> you<00:03:52.790> don't<00:03:53.000> run<00:03:53.150> into<00:03:53.269> too<00:03:53.540> much

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:53.689 
project so you don't run into too much

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:57.509 
project so you don't run into too much
of<00:03:53.750> that<00:03:54.489> so<00:03:55.489> now<00:03:55.519> we're<00:03:55.819> gonna<00:03:55.909> go<00:03:56.120> bake<00:03:56.359> this

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
of that so now we're gonna go bake this

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:05.099 
of that so now we're gonna go bake this
probably<00:03:58.519> for<00:03:58.900> 20<00:03:59.900> minutes<00:04:00.169> or<00:04:00.290> so<00:04:00.530> at<00:04:00.979> 375

Pease and I had a little unexpected
thing<00:06:56.879> happened<00:06:57.889> I'm<00:06:58.889> thinking<00:06:59.429> it's<00:06:59.639> because

00:06:59.779 --> 00:06:59.789 
thing happened I'm thinking it's because

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:02.659 
thing happened I'm thinking it's because
of<00:07:00.389> the<00:07:00.659> crimson<00:07:01.139> paint<00:07:01.469> that<00:07:01.679> I<00:07:01.769> added<00:07:02.009> to<00:07:02.279> the

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:02.669 
of the crimson paint that I added to the

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:05.089 
of the crimson paint that I added to the
liquid<00:07:02.969> clay<00:07:03.239> but<00:07:03.959> it<00:07:04.079> actually<00:07:04.259> puffed<00:07:04.739> up<00:07:04.949> a

00:07:05.089 --> 00:07:05.099 
liquid clay but it actually puffed up a

00:07:05.099 --> 00:07:06.949 
liquid clay but it actually puffed up a
little<00:07:05.279> so<00:07:05.909> I<00:07:05.939> got<00:07:06.119> a<00:07:06.149> really<00:07:06.360> cool<00:07:06.599> look<00:07:06.809> that

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:06.959 
little so I got a really cool look that

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:09.109 
little so I got a really cool look that
I<00:07:06.989> wasn't<00:07:07.229> expecting<00:07:07.919> but<00:07:08.219> a<00:07:08.459> cool<00:07:08.939> look

00:07:09.109 --> 00:07:09.119 
I wasn't expecting but a cool look

00:07:09.119 --> 00:07:11.029 
I wasn't expecting but a cool look
nonetheless<00:07:09.509> so<00:07:10.139> as<00:07:10.289> you<00:07:10.379> can<00:07:10.529> you<00:07:10.919> could

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:11.039 
nonetheless so as you can you could

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:12.439 
nonetheless so as you can you could
probably<00:07:11.189> see<00:07:11.489> from<00:07:11.519> this<00:07:11.879> angle<00:07:12.089> it's<00:07:12.360> a

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:12.449 
probably see from this angle it's a

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:15.529 
probably see from this angle it's a
little<00:07:12.659> puffed<00:07:12.929> up<00:07:13.639> so<00:07:14.639> you<00:07:15.299> could<00:07:15.449> take

00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:15.539 
little puffed up so you could take

00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:18.169 
little puffed up so you could take
advantage<00:07:15.959> of<00:07:16.139> that<00:07:16.319> and<00:07:16.789> get<00:07:17.789> a<00:07:17.849> hole<00:07:18.059> in

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:18.179 
advantage of that and get a hole in

00:07:18.179 --> 00:07:20.719 
advantage of that and get a hole in
another<00:07:18.239> look<00:07:18.689> so<00:07:19.379> anyways<00:07:20.099> I<00:07:20.279> put<00:07:20.519> it<00:07:20.610> in

00:07:20.719 --> 00:07:20.729 
another look so anyways I put it in

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:22.789 
another look so anyways I put it in
around<00:07:21.299> the<00:07:21.569> heart<00:07:21.779> that<00:07:21.989> I<00:07:22.079> had<00:07:22.199> carved<00:07:22.499> out

00:07:22.789 --> 00:07:22.799 
around the heart that I had carved out

00:07:22.799 --> 00:07:24.919 
around the heart that I had carved out
and<00:07:23.099> filled<00:07:23.699> in<00:07:23.849> that<00:07:23.879> space<00:07:24.269> for<00:07:24.599> a<00:07:24.629> really

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:24.929
