 [Music] 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.780
 I'm as Peruvian as the ceviche say 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:16.120
 some to be proud of the 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.830
 the land where they were born was polemicized about 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.930
 its writing and it was discussed on what 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.539
 region of the country was better prepared 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.609
 our plate bears the colors red and 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.949
 where I go and is the ambassador of 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:29.470
 the national gastronomy never again 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:32.140
 proud to feel our and willing 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.020
 to defend them which threatened territory 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:38.350
 before observers of their identity alone 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.969
 par excellence since 2008 the 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.280
 production ministry established 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:44.140
 the day of the cebiche another date of pride 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.250
 national which is just another 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.350
 pretext to prove it until saying enough 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:54.460
 I do not want for you what the 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:59.590
 seville fly good first is 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:03.149
 a cultural heritage of the nation 's 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.149
 Peru because they are 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:11.710
 zigorrik and in 1890 to bradl in the region 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.560
 of the Peruvian recipes was not put 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:18.090
 to leave to pickle the lack of chad 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:22.679
 indicated leaving the fish 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:27.810
 the orange juice does not like that as well 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:31.859
 thumb vidal in the year in the 16th century no 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:37.319
 in his stories he speaks of the word 

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:41.310
 widget that means not tender fish or 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:44.670
 fresh fish or put a plate 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.560
 since he is Peruvian no one can not today 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.880
 day is already spread throughout the 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.340
 Pacific all say that there is no 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.200
 but several ways to prepare it 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.060
 He also comments that trujillo are the 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.060
 northern hands that prepare the best 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.429
 cebiche from the huariques the sale to 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.950
 I pass the crouched until their preparation 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:07.409
 gourmet are in various forms and 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.709
 Sizes some more spicy than others 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.260
 But yes, we always wanted Peruvians 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.510
 know the abc in the preparation of 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.360
 our ceviche and what better than a great 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.610
 friend william reads the restaurant dona 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.100
 peta teaches us the secrets of a 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.110
 inevitable northern ceviche 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:31.080
 will take the seasonings before 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:33.840
 rudder for what reason because it penetrates a 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:39.810
 Once you are and pour the lemon 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:41.790
 fish as if to waterproof it and 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.210
 the condiments and we are very well not 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.210
 best 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:53.730
 a little bit of egypt but not so much either 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.260
 and to us then as I said does not have 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.450
 lemon 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:07.140
 in this way the condiments can 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:10.100
 penetrate expressed as well as justly 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:14.360
 we speak in advance at the beginning 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:17.130
 the diagonal cut does not 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.070
 makes it easier for condiments to enter 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.950
 immediately to the fish that is not 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.410
 needed more weird much is already there 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.360
 is then we proceed to the 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.930
 lemon cable 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.680
 we're fine let's go live in the sea 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.630
 now if you let it marinate already with lemon 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.060
 five minutes 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.460
 then 2 while we leave it as 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:45.510
 let's make two plates one let's go 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:49.580
 prepare the rest the salsita all 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:52.600
 It must be separated to my understanding 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:56.390
 the taste of squid can not be mixed 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:04:00.000
 with the taste of the octopus as the flavor of 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:03.110
 snail has to be separated 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.110
 so that each seafood has its own 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.110
 taste 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.580
 the ceviche has meant a revolution 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.470
 in social networks has a page 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.200

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.980

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.500
 up a page called ceviche tv 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.360
 the ceviche with its different touch of 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.120
 sour taste and itching of pieces of 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.720
 fresh and firm fish marinated sen 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.190
 mol del norte onion chili mocharo salt and 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.130
 well presented with its components 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:38.100
 regional with lettuce sweet potato 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.650
 Yucca is the most requested dish of the 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.630
 Peruvian gastronomy getting so much 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.840
 in Peru as well as abroad 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.510
 unavoidable recognition 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.550
 workshops have been organized with the 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.669
 presence of the main routes of the 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:56.130
 Trujillo capital on June 28 is the 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:58.260
 date chosen to provide by our 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.990

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.090

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.770
 he knows it is another excuse for not 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:14.220
 stay with the desire and be oblivious to 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:18.030

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:20.250
