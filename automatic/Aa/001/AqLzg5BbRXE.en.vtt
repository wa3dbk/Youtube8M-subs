00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.170 
so it has really good thumb has really
good<00:01:43.110> sound<00:01:43.380> as<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.040> can<00:01:44.100> tell<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.670> the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
good sound as you can tell the the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.609 
good sound as you can tell the the
speaker's<00:01:45.540> designed<00:01:45.930> in<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.079> way<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.259> whether

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
speaker's designed in a way to whether

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.560 
speaker's designed in a way to whether
the<00:01:47.100> speakers<00:01:47.579> are<00:01:47.700> pointing<00:01:48.030> one<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.299> pointed

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
the speakers are pointing one is pointed

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.090 
the speakers are pointing one is pointed
up<00:01:48.689> but<00:01:48.840> one<00:01:48.990> is<00:01:49.079> pointing<00:01:49.350> down<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.890> sub

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
up but one is pointing down and the sub

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.560 
up but one is pointing down and the sub
is<00:01:50.130> in<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.460> middle<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.969> so<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:51.360> kind<00:01:51.540> of

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
is in the middle and so this kind of

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.090 
is in the middle and so this kind of
really<00:01:51.840> creates<00:01:52.140> an<00:01:52.229> omnidirectional<00:01:52.619> type

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
really creates an omnidirectional type

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.039 
really creates an omnidirectional type
of<00:01:53.250> 360<00:01:53.909> audio<00:01:54.240> experience<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:54.869> no<00:01:54.960> matter

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
of 360 audio experience so no matter

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.209 
of 360 audio experience so no matter
where<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.290> place<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:55.740> like<00:01:55.829> whether<00:01:56.009> it's<00:01:56.159> in

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
where you place it like whether it's in

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.740 
where you place it like whether it's in
the<00:01:56.280> middle<00:01:56.399> of<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.549> table<00:01:56.909> or<00:01:57.360> on<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.539> side<00:01:57.719> of

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
the middle of a table or on the side of

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.690 
the middle of a table or on the side of
the<00:01:57.869> pool<00:01:58.049> or<00:01:58.259> something<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:59.159> audio<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.520> going

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
the pool or something the audio is going

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.920 
the pool or something the audio is going
to<00:01:59.759> go<00:01:59.850> everywhere<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.329> it<00:02:00.570> sounds<00:02:00.780> really

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
to go everywhere and it sounds really

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.240 
to go everywhere and it sounds really
good<00:02:01.079> even<00:02:01.289> though<00:02:01.350> it's<00:02:01.439> fully<00:02:01.740> cranked<00:02:02.159> up

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
good even though it's fully cranked up

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.800 
good even though it's fully cranked up
the<00:02:02.310> audio<00:02:02.610> quality<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:03.090> pretty<00:02:03.479> pretty

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
the audio quality is pretty pretty

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.450 
the audio quality is pretty pretty
decent<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.380> does<00:02:04.530> feature<00:02:04.710> some<00:02:05.009> control

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
decent it does feature some control

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.010 
decent it does feature some control
playback<00:02:05.700> controls<00:02:06.240> on<00:02:06.420> there<00:02:06.539> so<00:02:06.719> if<00:02:06.869> you
