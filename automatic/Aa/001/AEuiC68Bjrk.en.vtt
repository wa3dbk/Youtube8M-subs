of inks

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.490 
of inks
they're<00:00:50.550> quite<00:00:50.789> hefty<00:00:53.270> and<00:00:54.270> that's<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.410> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
they're quite hefty and that's it in the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.660 
they're quite hefty and that's it in the

box so I have one that's for someone

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.850 
box so I have one that's for someone
else<00:00:59.850> which<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:02.000> the<00:01:03.000> still<00:01:03.270> quick<00:01:03.570> version

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
else which is the still quick version

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.820 
else which is the still quick version
and<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.010> give<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.400> someone<00:01:06.409> and<00:01:07.409> then<00:01:07.680> I

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
and you give that to someone and then I

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:19.310 
and you give that to someone and then I
have<00:01:08.630> the<00:01:09.630> sandstone<00:01:10.260> black<00:01:13.580> so<00:01:14.580> wait<00:01:16.280> so<00:01:18.320> so

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
have the sandstone black so wait so so

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.570 
have the sandstone black so wait so so
you<00:01:19.439> can<00:01:19.590> tell<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.860> since<00:01:20.070> been<00:01:20.280> black<00:01:20.549> and

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
you can tell it since been black and

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.539 
you can tell it since been black and
soap<00:01:20.939> white<00:01:21.210> but<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.110> packaging<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.280> same

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
soap white but the packaging is the same

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:31.850 
soap white but the packaging is the same
so<00:01:23.880> it's<00:01:24.090> kind<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.450> weird<00:01:25.640> so<00:01:26.640> simply<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:30.860> I'm

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
so it's kind of weird so simply and I'm

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.319 
so it's kind of weird so simply and I'm
not<00:01:32.040> sure<00:01:32.280> if<00:01:32.400> I'm<00:01:32.490> going<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.729> open<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.090> drone

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
not sure if I'm going to open the drone

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.270 
not sure if I'm going to open the drone
cuz<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:34.110> might<00:01:34.979> sell<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.369> online<00:01:36.979> people<00:01:37.979> aren't

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
cuz I might sell it online people aren't

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.580 
cuz I might sell it online people aren't

milliamp<00:02:22.720> little<00:02:23.720> tag<00:02:23.989> on<00:02:24.140> top<00:02:32.080> so<00:02:33.080> my<00:02:33.110> camera

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
milliamp little tag on top so my camera

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.070 
milliamp little tag on top so my camera
ran<00:02:33.799> out<00:02:33.830> of<00:02:34.010> space<00:02:34.370> so<00:02:34.790> I<00:02:35.120> had<00:02:35.360> to<00:02:35.540> import<00:02:35.930> it

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
ran out of space so I had to import it

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.860 
ran out of space so I had to import it
to<00:02:36.110> my<00:02:36.290> computer<00:02:37.209> let's<00:02:38.209> continue<00:02:38.569> with<00:02:38.780> the

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
to my computer let's continue with the

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:55.290 
to my computer let's continue with the
unboxing<00:02:39.760> so<00:02:40.760> sandstone<00:02:41.390> black

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:06.760

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
pretty sharp red box in the inside there

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:19.660 
pretty sharp red box in the inside there
it<00:03:06.890> is<00:03:07.010> the<00:03:07.250> sandstone<00:03:07.850> black<00:03:08.150> power<00:03:08.600> bank<00:03:18.670> set

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
it is the sandstone black power bank set

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.480 
it is the sandstone black power bank set
that<00:03:19.820> aside

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490 
that aside

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:28.900 
that aside
and<00:03:22.490> they<00:03:22.970> give<00:03:23.150> you<00:03:23.360> a<00:03:25.090> microUSB<00:03:26.090> cable<00:03:27.910> and

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
and they give you a microUSB cable and

and they give you a microUSB cable and
it's<00:03:29.600> a<00:03:29.720> flat<00:03:29.960> cable<00:03:30.200> so<00:03:30.800> that's<00:03:30.980> pretty<00:03:31.310> nice

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
it's a flat cable so that's pretty nice

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:39.960 
it's a flat cable so that's pretty nice
touch<00:03:35.830> and<00:03:36.830> unlike<00:03:37.430> unlike<00:03:38.050> many<00:03:39.050> charges

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
touch and unlike unlike many charges

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.700 
touch and unlike unlike many charges
well<00:03:40.970> the<00:03:41.150> Apple<00:03:41.450> Chargers<00:03:41.780> these<00:03:42.380> are<00:03:42.530> matte

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:42.710 
well the Apple Chargers these are matte

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.910 
well the Apple Chargers these are matte
finish<00:03:43.100> so<00:03:44.050> they<00:03:45.050> don't<00:03:45.200> get<00:03:45.290> fingerprints

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
finish so they don't get fingerprints

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.460 
finish so they don't get fingerprints
and<00:03:46.670> you<00:03:47.150> get<00:03:47.300> a<00:03:47.330> one<00:03:47.570> plus<00:03:47.810> branding<00:03:48.320> on<00:03:48.440> it

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
and you get a one plus branding on it

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.770 
and you get a one plus branding on it
which<00:03:49.340> is<00:03:49.370> cool<00:03:49.820> and<00:03:51.250> that's<00:03:52.250> how<00:03:52.460> you<00:03:52.660> plug<00:03:53.660> it

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
which is cool and that's how you plug it

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.120 
which is cool and that's how you plug it
up<00:03:53.840> to<00:03:54.020> charge<00:03:54.260> up<00:03:54.410> the<00:03:54.560> power<00:03:54.920> bank<00:03:56.770> so<00:03:57.770> here's

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
up to charge up the power bank so here's

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:05.560 
up to charge up the power bank so here's
the<00:03:58.220> power<00:03:58.430> bank<00:03:58.640> unit<00:04:04.270> again<00:04:05.270> little

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
the power bank unit again little

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.050 
the power bank unit again little
pamphlet

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:19.979 

so<00:04:11.060> let's<00:04:11.210> find<00:04:11.450> it<00:04:11.570> out<00:04:18.459> it's<00:04:19.459> a<00:04:19.519> pretty<00:04:19.549> thick

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
so let's find it out it's a pretty thick

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.360 
so let's find it out it's a pretty thick
plastic<00:04:20.989> sleeve<00:04:23.560> and<00:04:24.560> here<00:04:24.860> it<00:04:24.980> is<00:04:25.100> the

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
plastic sleeve and here it is the

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.250 
plastic sleeve and here it is the
sandstone<00:04:27.850> it<00:04:28.850> has<00:04:29.090> that<00:04:29.240> really<00:04:29.450> nice<00:04:29.720> grippy

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
sandstone it has that really nice grippy

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:41.050 
sandstone it has that really nice grippy
feeling<00:04:31.660> just<00:04:32.660> like<00:04:32.840> the<00:04:32.990> foam<00:04:33.200> itself

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.440 

and<00:04:41.950> I'm<00:04:42.950> pretty<00:04:43.220> sure<00:04:43.310> this<00:04:43.610> is<00:04:43.760> an<00:04:43.940> aluminum

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
and I'm pretty sure this is an aluminum

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:52.030 
and I'm pretty sure this is an aluminum

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.040
