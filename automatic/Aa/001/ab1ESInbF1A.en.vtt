00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.569
 hello people I hope you are well here 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:07.939
 is entering the old wey of had 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.580
 Mexican baneos I tried to do the 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:12.440
 similar design but I used another color here 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.499
 is the mixture in a color of organic 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.980
 true because it is white use the 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:21.110
 trigger because I love this design and 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.450
 I wanted to try it with another color so 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.920
 how my favorite color is turquoise 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.230
 Well then, I'm using it with 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.000
 this color to see how it looks ok but it's 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.950
 the same design of our friend because 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.829
 is one of my designs I think that 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.679
 favorites so you already know it so 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.380
 nothing that I'm doing the stiletto nail 

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:42.440
 true full of this color 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.810
 ok it 's very important that you know how 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.600
 soon I finished making the nail 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:50.900
 I'm going to encapsulate it with a 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.150
 fine layer of crystal acrylic this 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.190
 I do it simply true for safety 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.010
 in my case since it is color material 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.900
 true that is being used and what 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.980
 I do then to create a little truth 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:06.020
 of crystallinity in the nail and that so 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.460
 after this is done I'm going to 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.250
 start then after shaping 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.830
 I'm going to file and then I'm going to polish with 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.930
 that nail completely and then then the 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.000
 I'm going to clean with sleep just like in my 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.710
 true case in the case of those who do not 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.500
 have then they can use alcohol too 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.330
 to clean your nail that after you're 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.350
 cleaner then I will proceed 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.509
 true to begin forgiveness the third 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.610
 dimension here in the third dimension 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:35.030
 I'm going to do exactly two 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.940
 little flowers ok one at one end and the other 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.100
 to the other using simply the petal 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.340
 basic truth that in the petal where 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.090
 we put a pearl and then to 45 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.510
 degrees we press in the center 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.910
 of that special at 45 degrees so that 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.090
 there are those four petals ok I'm going to 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:57.550
 then make another flower in the part of 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.070
 down in the same way I'm using a 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.200
 brush number 2 to really do this 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.020
 type of relief because it is a petal more 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.140
 small truth in a true nail 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.910
 stiletto as such and that I love 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.060
 much this design I understand that it is a 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.800
 Well elegant design looks very beautiful and 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.709
 also at the same time although a nail is 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.930
 sink is a very delicate design that 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.620
 I'm going to do now, I'm going to do 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.450
 to place a true stone and stone 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.000
 that I'm going to place the fence placed under 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.350
 instead of up like my little friend I'm going 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.170
 to place down to do something 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.650
 different also in the design I'm going to 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.360
 can now with video from the uach him 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.850
 I can place it around the nail by 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.100
 where I really want because my rain 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.810
 stones and I'm going to place my tous reigns 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.220
 indiscriminately as well as 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.040
 our little friend did it in the video 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:51.150
 buoy then to place different 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.430
 different sizes true 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.780
 with the orientations until I 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.320
 feel that I am completely 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:02.010
 satisfied with the design that after 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:06.340
 this is true that I have finished placing 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.140
 most of the other stones then 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.720
 I will proceed then after I am 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.760
 finished I'll clean up and then that 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.360
 had actually cleaned with alcohol the 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:19.480
 over then I will place the tag 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.240
 with geo in the area where it is not so 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.190
 true where there are no pebbles ok this 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.530
 I do so that then that nail has that 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.510
 wonderful shine true and look more 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.880
 pretty here we can see how 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.830
 the pebble was true 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.900
 I did it basically halfway through 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.430
 the nail because I love how it looks and 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:41.620
 so what I'm going to do is I'm going to 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:44.950
 place true be a little metallic 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.800
 on the side of the metal acrylic or 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:51.340
 plated on the edges of the flower 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.320
 because I had truly is online 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.670
 color that is silver so then 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.220
 how do you know that this acrylic has 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.870
 then use to place the sap 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.450
 coats because that is what we are 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.610
 observing here and then but here 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.910
 they have truth after drying 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:10.590
 this nail in the lamp the result 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:13.570
 final I hope you liked it is 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:16.030
 another alternative to the wonderful 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.430
 design that was our friend this is 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.739
 nova neox truth instead of being true 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.380
 nude color because turquoise says it 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.570
 to see how it looked and this is 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.730
 well pleased because the design of 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.890
 spectacular and how the design is 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.750
 spectacular does not matter the color that 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.450
 use I think it will look good 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.270
 nice so you really do not that everything 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.580
 the limits to be creative ok 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.290
 so I hope you liked it 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.660
 many kisses many blessings and lots 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.260
 luck to all the god participants 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.650
 bless you
