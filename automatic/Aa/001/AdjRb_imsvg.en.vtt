00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:23.159
 the area 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:29.949
 I know them 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.890
 I have seen them many times they are rare they leave early in the morning and 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.850
 They strive to beat the sun 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.260
 when everyone sleeps 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.440
 they leave on tiptoe without making noise 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.800
 the condemned 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.660
 they want to bother him 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.330
 they are crazy 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.610
 in summer but they have 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.130
 they go down transpiran 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.750
 they get dehydrated and finally get tired just to enjoy the rest 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.310
 in winter, they get clogged 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.780
 they complain they complain they cool down they catch a cold and they let the rain 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.400
 monks 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.440
 they pedal soaked and always 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.580
 when not because of the rain because of the scare 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.590
 I have seen them pass by quickly down the trees slowly 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.570
 meander dirt roads 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.600
 climb steep slopes 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.380
 clink wooden bridges 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.790

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.200
 jump obstacles 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.320
 eventually 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.760
 a good of a dog the best incentive to pedal fast they say 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.020
 listen to music that accompanies the rhythm of your legs 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.710
 listen to the noise of mine 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.120
 almaty kos in the stands 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.260
 at the polls 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.470
 in the mud by the tire helmets on the pavement 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.340
 all this is music 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.030
 I have seen them are not right in the head just in slippers conflicts 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.049
 not to get rid of his beloved bicycle 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.049
 even when they go flying through the air with 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.820
 the sweater perspire the hull in the bunk beds and the juan 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.870
 time and its moon cadence among others 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.870
 they try to beat someone only they 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.190
 they sign up for all the races 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.979
 they rarely win 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.709
 they start running the previous night 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.679
 they dream that they pedal between rocks and rivers 

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:20.119
 in the morning they rise like children in the day of kings 

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:23.769
 They have prepared clothes that rest on a chair 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.489
 as they did in their childhood on the eve of holidays 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:32.419
 the day before the race, he comments until they do not drink alcohol 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:37.629
 but they are rewarded with impudence and with roast beef and beer as soon as the 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.129
 competition 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:45.209
 I could never calculate their age but surely they are between 15 and 85 years old 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.209
 with men and women 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:52.899
 they sign up for outsourcing races of their 80 kilometers 

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:54.310
 and before you start 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.530
 they know they can not win even if everyone else is missing 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.020
 They release anxiety at each exit and a few minutes before arrival they need 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.639
 win 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:10.370
 they adjust their chronometer and try to locate the four or five paintings that 

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:11.849
 we have to beat them 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.189
 are your career references 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:16.909
 5 that pedal similar to me 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:18.709
 beat only one of 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.739
 they will be enough to sleep at night with a smile 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.449
 they enjoy when they pass another cyclist 

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:27.660
 but they encourage it 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.030
 they tell him that there is not much left and they ask him not to loosen up 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:35.999
 compete fiercely when asked who 

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:41.009
 invariably I answered before against themselves ports are not 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:47.309
 six look up to the last breath to pass ayc cyclist your competitor be 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.449
 but if the vehement thank you stops to help it makes sense 

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:57.380
 they reach the goal exhausted breathless 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.600
 they arrive in last place and still raise their arms in triumph 

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:04.629
 according to a new study 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:09.430
 they do not prepare them but they have all the excuses by the time they reach 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.529
 the girl 

00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:11.869
 no ballast 

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:13.589
 they are part of them 

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:14.739
 I punch 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.690
 the rear derailleur that failed the changes came jumping 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.709
 the sleepless two days ago 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.419
 the slow traffic of those who left before 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.180
 I lost the way 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.650
 their legs hurt 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.169
 seat alhambra have difficulty breathing have stitches in the side in extreme cases 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.169
 the legs refuse to continue 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.840
 as they move in the afternoon 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.200
 the muscles suffer more and more 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.009
 the face is disfigured 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:46.670
 Perspiration runs on their faces 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.250
 the stitches begin to repeat 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.940
 and 15 kilometers before arrival 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.130
 they begin to wonder what they are doing 

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:57.809
 this year 

00:04:57.809 --> 00:05:00.009
 I know them 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:01.230
 they congratulate each other 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.230
 they remember parts of the track 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.819
 talk about the infernal descent 

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:08.659
 and of the insufferable slope 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:11.040
 talk about how the conquests goal 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.189
 they all speak 

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:14.110
 everyone listens 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.180
 I've seen them a lot 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.089
 they are bad in the head 

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:21.939
 they look with affection and without hurting the one who arrives 20 minutes later 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:26.789
 they respect the last and the second last because they say they are respected by the 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:29.259
 first and for the second 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:33.770
 they are grouped by teams and share with the second family part of the 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:34.860
 Sundays 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.670
 they share all the photos that they take 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.970
 and they do not notice that they are the same as those of the previous race 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.380
 They hang their medals in places in the house where the visit can see them and 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:48.979
 have to ask 

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:50.370
 they are wrong 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.570
 is there since last month they say trying to use their tone plus a 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.900
 this is the first one that wins say omitting inform that they were given 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:00.630
 to all 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.889
 including the one who arrived last 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:06.300
 suffer falls hurt 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.270
 rest are restored and invariably come back to climb in 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.629
 his bike 

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:14.529
 they say that companies lan 

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:18.289
 the pain disappears but the glory lives forever 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:22.119
 that must be why they are 

00:06:22.119 --> 00:06:25.519
 sometimes they go out alone in the company of their inseparable fish 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.370
 they say that few people for these times 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.120
 they are able to be alone with themselves a prayer 

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:35.789
 them and I enjoy it 

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:40.139
 in those places that seem exclusive for your unican delight is 

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:42.919
 I arrange 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:45.710
 6 tanya pri sing to their bicycle 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.710
 strut care what else seems like the bene 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.610
 I'm sure that if they could, they would lead to failure 

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:56.319
 they are wrong with her 

00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:58.449
 I have seen them 

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:00.979
 they never remember how they started 

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:03.789
 but they worry about inviting one 

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:07.160
 as someone who wants to share his fortune with those he wants 

00:07:08.059 --> 00:07:10.940
 they think they are discoverers of a great secret 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:11.960
 who only 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.939
 those who follow their tracks on the world's bicycle have access 

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:20.539
 those who convince propaganda kings 

00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:26.099
 in a few months they will start to transform and they will be as crazy as I said that 

00:07:27.939 --> 00:07:30.789
 I think they want to beat Lanús 

00:07:30.789 --> 00:07:33.740
 they say they want to beat the atlantean 

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.349
 one thing is certain 

00:07:35.349 --> 00:07:41.229
 they are completely crazy and only they and those who dare to follow them 

00:07:41.229 --> 00:07:44.039
 they are able to enjoy that madness 

00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:46.559
 how do they do 

00:07:46.559 --> 00:07:48.429
 the world would be another 

00:07:48.429 --> 00:07:49.460
 definitely 

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.480
 if there were more novel
