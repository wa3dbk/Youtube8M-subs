00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.169 
like Chuck Berry who did things on the
guitar<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.560> mean<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:28.980> was<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.220> guitar<00:00:29.609> player<00:00:29.640> and

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
guitar I mean I was a guitar player and

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.240 
guitar I mean I was a guitar player and
I<00:00:30.720> would<00:00:30.900> hear<00:00:31.170> what<00:00:31.289> he<00:00:31.500> was<00:00:31.679> doing<00:00:31.980> on<00:00:32.099> the

I would hear what he was doing on the
guitar<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.880> I'd<00:00:32.940> say<00:00:33.149> nobody<00:00:33.480> else<00:00:33.660> is

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
guitar and I'd say nobody else is

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.200 
guitar and I'd say nobody else is
playing<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.500> at<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:35.040> velocity<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:36.090> know

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
playing it at that velocity you know

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.549 
playing it at that velocity you know
nobody's<00:00:36.630> playing<00:00:36.870> with<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.680> rhythmic

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
nobody's playing with that rhythmic

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.760 
nobody's playing with that rhythmic
consideration<00:00:40.559> at<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.550> forefront<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.770> and

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
consideration at the forefront of and

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.209 
consideration at the forefront of and
the<00:00:44.399> tone<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:45.180> guitar<00:00:45.329> was<00:00:46.260> compelling<00:00:46.800> to

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
the tone of the guitar was compelling to

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.490 
the tone of the guitar was compelling to
me<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.520> didn't<00:00:47.789> sound<00:00:47.969> like<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.329> Spanish<00:00:49.289> guitar

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
a huge influence in the tone of the

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.890 
a huge influence in the tone of the
guitar<00:01:14.640> there<00:01:15.030> was<00:01:15.150> something<00:01:15.479> happening<00:01:15.810> in

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
guitar there was something happening in

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.600 
guitar there was something happening in
the<00:01:15.960> sound<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.680> electric<00:01:17.070> guitar<00:01:17.159> that

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
the sound of the electric guitar that

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.929 
the sound of the electric guitar that
really<00:01:18.240> reflected<00:01:18.979> more<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.189> culture<00:01:20.670> in

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
really reflected more of the culture in

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.450 
really reflected more of the culture in
those<00:01:21.210> days<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.750> wasn't<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.590> guitar<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.310> was

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
those days it wasn't the guitar it was

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.420 
those days it wasn't the guitar it was
an<00:01:23.580> electric<00:01:24.119> guitar<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:26.250> those

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
an electric guitar and and so those

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.460

all over the country and lived in Europe
and<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:51.920> I<00:01:54.049> just<00:01:55.049> reached<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.560> point<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:56.130> know

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310

and and I just reached a point you know
where<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:57.920> was<00:01:58.920> in<00:01:59.130> my<00:01:59.869> late<00:02:00.869> 40s<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:02.030> realized

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
where I was in my late 40s and realized

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.420 
where I was in my late 40s and realized
that<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.810> wasn't<00:02:04.560> going<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.710> live<00:02:04.890> forever

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
that I wasn't going to live forever

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.930
