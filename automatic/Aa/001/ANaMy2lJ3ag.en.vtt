00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.790
 new video of me 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.859
 how fast time flies 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.769
 I have this over half a year 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.570
 monitor from dell to box and it is 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.000
 High time that I finally think 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.119
 promise to come also a video 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.859
 to do so a long test time 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.900
 but also brings its benefits 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.699
 itself so that in this video things 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.609
 Otherwise you can not call them after only 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.900
 a few weeks would have been noticed 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.789
 and I can already anticipate 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.689
 that I really from the monitor 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.790
 am amazed 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.710
 which features I like the most 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.050
 have and why i like the monitor so well 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.149
 I will tell you now in the course 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.290
 first of all to the videos 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.860
 externalities 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.260
 the first thing you notice immediately 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.450
 he has a narrow edge and yes 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.340
 I also find the frame and the design 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.989
 really impressive and if you are 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.629
 will take the finger once too 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.430
 quickly realized why the flat frosted 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.789
 The surface looks like a one - stop shop 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.199
 you also pull out very cool 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.600
 I am also a fan of the 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.549
 cable routing has become the most in the crowd 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.619
 from cables nobody can connect too 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.729
 really necessary 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.909
 where we already at the next point 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.100
 Become the big connection variety of 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.799
 he offers twice hdmi at the entrances 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.820
 a displayport a mini displayport 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.799
 and a usb 3.0 upstream connection the 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.530
 one can call the monitor as a kind 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.990
 usb hub used because as a foreigner has 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.090
 the same four usb slots one 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.700
 displayport output and even one 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.259
 audio line out for audio signals through to 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.100
 grind and speaker 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.110
 to pass 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.259
 because even in the monitor is not installed 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.420
 are a small drawback is unfortunately the 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.590
 all usb hub connected devices from 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.060
 be separated stream 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.530
 as soon as you switch off in the monitor 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.750
 Let's get to the soft touch now 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.869
 buttons with which you monitor the state 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.610
 or on and off one presses one 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.650
 Any one comes in a fast 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.180
 selection menu with the possibility in the 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.979
 monitor settings to go 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.890
 Here you can now at will 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.229
 adjust color values ​​contrasts etc 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.209
 but I personally think that 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.790
 monitor already ex factory a very nice 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.470
 neutral color rendering therefore provides 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.870
 usually not 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.360
 I have to take care of everything 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.459
 It has disturbed the keys that she 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.640
 often react only unreliable so that 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.510
 you often have to press repeatedly 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.860
 we would have mechanical keys there 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.860
 much like it better 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.900
 worth mentioning I also find that 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.790
 the status led of the monitor easily 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.060
 pulsates when no device 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.770
 connected is that looks good 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.200
 but in a completely dark room 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.390
 have a disturbing effect 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.520
 we come to the display itself and how 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.200
 it with different light conditions 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.680
 You'll see that you see a lot here 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.570
 beautiful 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.070
 how good that anti-reflective in which I am 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.860
 the monitor once in the off 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:02.000
 condition and once in the switched on 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:04.310
 exposing my helmet I find that 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.930
 Matte display really great and it 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.730
 is exactly what it is supposed to be 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.730
 minimize reflections 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.190
 in the completely darkened room it does 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.160
 but of course the best figure 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.960
 and also the viewing angle stability like 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.610
 you can see it very well here 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.610
 really good 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.660
 and also background blading is yes 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.630
 actually always a tiresome 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.490
 topic with led monitor but find here 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.350
 I'm lighting up every single one 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.300
 are very good at the edges 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.580
 and also on the color gradation below 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.350
 I can not fault Gray Scala 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.480
 I can only do that, however 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.130
 a normal consumer judge there 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.190
 I'm not a professional with the 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.050
 We know perfectly well now 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.810
 another look at the gaming and 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.340
 Moving performance and games 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.510
 I here to test a small party 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.750
 bioshock infinite 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.640
 and alien isolation alike 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.860
 I intentionally a bit hectic 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.770
 move around the artifacts a bit 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.540
 to emphasize more 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.030
 on a closer look you can certainly 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.010
 things like follow up and similar 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.540
 Inconsistencies notice that 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.540
 probably the eight milliseconds 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.610
 delay are owed but at 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.830
 normal gambling should hardly be noticed 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.330
 and for me not disturbing 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.070
 are 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.690
 I think of people very often 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.790
 gambling games or gambling 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.740
 operate gaming professionally 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.900
 with such a monitor is not in question 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.510
 However, you have come too 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.650
 quite different claims 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.660
 or you should then 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.110
 same with special gaming monitors 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.110
 look 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.880
 At least I am very happy again 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:05:10.090
 happy with how the monitor 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:12.520
 now we come to my conclusion 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.650
 and you already know my opinion 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.870
 I think the monitor is great but me 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.750
 just want to summarize it briefly 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:22.419
 and i have to say price- performance 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.810
 technically the monitor offers for 200 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:26.169
 Euro 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.500
 when I bought it for 250 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:28.210
 Euro 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.580
 a very good price 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.020
 performance ratio when you look at the thin one 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.570
 frame, for example, that I consider 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.910
 great for a multi monitor setup 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.850
 offers the nice sharp display with 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.349
 the great colors that are for 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:44.470
 image editing and video editing a lot 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:46.810
 Well, the usb hub is the anti-reflective 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.030
 display and also generally the beautiful 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.520
 simple design complete the package for me 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.830
 for me one of the if not the 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.669
 best 24 inch monitor in the 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.520
 price segment 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:59.620
 Thank you for watching you beautiful 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:02.160
 Christmas and until the next 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.160
 Video
