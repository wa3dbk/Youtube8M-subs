when<00:00:01.079> I<00:00:01.110> said<00:00:01.490> 1994<00:00:02.490> 20<00:00:02.879> other<00:00:03.000> camera<00:00:03.449> that

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
when I said 1994 20 other camera that

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.410 
when I said 1994 20 other camera that
we're<00:00:03.720> done<00:00:03.870> it's<00:00:04.770> a<00:00:04.920> very<00:00:05.160> quiet<00:00:05.430> car<00:00:05.700> this<00:00:06.240> is

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
we're done it's a very quiet car this is

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.089 
we're done it's a very quiet car this is
the<00:00:06.569> way<00:00:06.690> an<00:00:06.810> electric<00:00:07.200> vehicle<00:00:07.410> should<00:00:07.799> sound

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
the way an electric vehicle should sound

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.009 
the way an electric vehicle should sound
when<00:00:08.790> you're<00:00:08.940> riding<00:00:09.240> down<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:09.540> road<00:00:09.690> if<00:00:09.990> you

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
when you're riding down the road if you

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.839 
when you're riding down the road if you
don't<00:00:10.320> have<00:00:10.469> any<00:00:10.679> transmission<00:00:11.400> issues<00:00:11.700> or

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
don't have any transmission issues or

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.089 
don't have any transmission issues or
anything<00:00:12.059> this<00:00:12.599> has<00:00:12.990> made<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.290> fabulous<00:00:13.590> car

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
anything this has made a fabulous car

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.670 
anything this has made a fabulous car
it's<00:00:15.000> somewhat<00:00:15.480> heavy<00:00:15.780> why<00:00:16.080> I'd<00:00:16.199> like<00:00:16.260> for<00:00:16.650> it

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
it's somewhat heavy why I'd like for it

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.460 
it's somewhat heavy why I'd like for it
to<00:00:16.770> be<00:00:16.859> but<00:00:17.609> at<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.820> same<00:00:18.060> time<00:00:18.330> it<00:00:19.230> works

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
to be but at the same time it works

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.790 
to be but at the same time it works
quite<00:00:19.800> nicely<00:00:20.119> and<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.810> test<00:00:22.289> drive<00:00:22.560> here

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
quite nicely and the test drive here

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.400 
quite nicely and the test drive here
will<00:00:22.949> demonstrate<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.840> quietness<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.289> and

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
will demonstrate the quietness of it and

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.670 
will demonstrate the quietness of it and
hopefully<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.980> smoothness<00:00:26.490> of<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:27.500> so<00:00:28.500> we'll

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
hopefully the smoothness of it so we'll

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.859 
hopefully the smoothness of it so we'll
take<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.890> ride<00:00:29.160> I'm<00:00:29.820> basically<00:00:30.240> along<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.660> same

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
take a ride I'm basically along the same

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.930 
take a ride I'm basically along the same
routes<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:31.380> we<00:00:31.470> did<00:00:31.650> on<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.890> stn<00:00:32.340> truck<00:00:32.640> and

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
routes that we did on the stn truck and

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.990 
routes that we did on the stn truck and
it<00:00:33.420> will<00:00:33.510> demonstrate<00:00:33.809> how<00:00:34.430> much<00:00:35.430> quieter

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
it will demonstrate how much quieter

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.950 
it will demonstrate how much quieter
this<00:00:36.180> one<00:00:36.390> he<00:00:36.450> has<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.570> debt<00:00:36.809> in<00:00:36.899> half

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
this one he has a debt in half

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.709 
this one he has a debt in half
transmission<00:00:37.649> issues<00:00:37.950> like<00:00:38.129> truck<00:00:38.430> does<00:00:38.719> so

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
transmission issues like truck does so

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.680 
transmission issues like truck does so
this<00:00:39.899> should<00:00:40.140> should<00:00:40.860> prove<00:00:41.129> nice<00:00:41.510> see<00:00:42.510> all

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
this should should prove nice see all

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.869 
this should should prove nice see all
you<00:00:42.719> can<00:00:43.020> hear<00:00:43.230> now<00:00:43.410> basically<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.730> I'm

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
you can hear now basically and I'm

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
speaking in a very low voice is the road

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.500 
speaking in a very low voice is the road
noise<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.920> tire<00:00:50.219> rolling<00:00:50.579> on<00:00:50.760> this<00:00:50.879> old<00:00:51.090> gravel

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
noise of tire rolling on this old gravel

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.810 
noise of tire rolling on this old gravel
rope<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.870> we<00:00:51.989> actually<00:00:52.230> hit<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.620> highway

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
rope and we actually hit the highway

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.740 
rope and we actually hit the highway
you'll<00:00:53.820> barely<00:00:54.420> hear<00:00:54.660> any<00:00:54.780> noise<00:00:55.079> at<00:00:55.199> all<00:00:56.750> this

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
car has really quite a nice nice car

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.650 
car has really quite a nice nice car
like<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:02.010> say<00:01:02.250> it's<00:01:02.550> somewhat<00:01:03.030> heavier<00:01:03.510> than

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
like I say it's somewhat heavier than

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.609 
like I say it's somewhat heavier than
what<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:03.899> would<00:01:04.229> like<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.220> do<00:01:05.400> on<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.790> conversion

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
what I would like to do on a conversion

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.170 
what I would like to do on a conversion
but<00:01:07.619> what<00:01:07.860> customer<00:01:08.340> wanted<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.880> that's<00:01:08.939> what

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
but what customer wanted and that's what

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.330 
but what customer wanted and that's what
we<00:01:09.330> want<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.570> give<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.810> customer<00:01:10.229> range<00:01:11.130> on

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
we want to give the customer range on

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.100 
we want to give the customer range on
this<00:01:11.490> vehicle<00:01:11.729> we<00:01:12.150> don't<00:01:12.360> know<00:01:12.630> yet<00:01:12.869> exactly

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
this vehicle we don't know yet exactly

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.590 
this vehicle we don't know yet exactly
what<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.740> range<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.100> going<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.490> be<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.939> think

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
what the range is going to be I think

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.770 
what the range is going to be I think
it'll<00:01:15.780> probably<00:01:16.080> somewhere<00:01:16.619> around<00:01:16.680> 30<00:01:17.189> miles

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
it'll probably somewhere around 30 miles

it'll probably somewhere around 30 miles
where<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:19.020> gentleman's<00:01:19.500> gonna<00:01:19.650> be<00:01:19.799> using

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
where this gentleman's gonna be using

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.770 
where this gentleman's gonna be using
this<00:01:20.250> vehicle<00:01:20.670> which<00:01:20.820> will<00:01:20.970> be<00:01:21.119> up<00:01:21.570> around

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
this vehicle which will be up around

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.300 
this vehicle which will be up around
Hendersonville<00:01:22.380> North<00:01:22.590> cloud<00:01:22.830> which<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.159> in

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
Hendersonville North cloud which is in

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.740 
Hendersonville North cloud which is in
the<00:01:23.400> mountains

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
the mountains

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.510 
the mountains
and<00:01:24.870> hopefully<00:01:25.050> he'll<00:01:25.380> get<00:01:25.500> at<00:01:25.620> least<00:01:25.650> 30<00:01:26.160> and

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
and hopefully he'll get at least 30 and

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.320 
and hopefully he'll get at least 30 and
hopefully<00:01:27.270> 40<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:27.780> what<00:01:27.960> we<00:01:28.080> were<00:01:28.200> hoping<00:01:28.260> for

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
hopefully 40 is what we were hoping for

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.430 
hopefully 40 is what we were hoping for
we'll<00:01:30.330> get<00:01:30.450> on<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.660> road<00:01:30.840> here<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.290> we'll

electric vehicle can be and once we get
on<00:01:37.260> this<00:01:37.410> road<00:01:37.620> how<00:01:37.830> will<00:01:37.860> be<00:01:38.550> quiet<00:01:38.910> so<00:01:39.210> you

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
on this road how will be quiet so you

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.990 
on this road how will be quiet so you
can<00:01:39.540> hear<00:01:39.750> how<00:01:39.810> quiet<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.470> is
