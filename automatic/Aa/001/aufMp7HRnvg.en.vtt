Hello Quang Binh!

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.920
MOOC SPRING IN 
SARACA ASOCA FLOWER SEASON

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.580
Hidden in the legendary forest
of Truong Son…

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.940
is Mooc spring – a sapphire gemstone
that you will love to explore.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.200
How did the stream
adopt the name of Mooc?

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.700
Well, this stream is believed

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.640
to come out of the ground  
or stone below right here.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.820
That’s why it’s called “Mooc”
(literally: coming out of the ground).

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.260
So, it means coming up.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.580
Right. The water is sent out 
from underground.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.240
We cannot tell exactly 
where its source is.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.940
Saraca asoca flowers
 come into bloom in March.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.220
If you come here then,
you can smell its gentle aroma.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.040
Saraca asoca flowers along 
the stream dyes the whole area

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.520
with its bright color.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.740
Its elegant smell seems 
to wake up this place

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.740
after a long, cold sleep.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.280
Walking along the stream for a while,

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.480
we decide to explore this 
natural heritage of the world

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.360
in a different way.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.460
We are going to take up 
a secret challenge.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.220
What is it?

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.900
Let’s check it out.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.460
Do you know what is it mean to zipline?

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.260
What is it?

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.740
Why do we have wear life jacket
 like this?

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.080
Oh, Gosh! The cable is so high.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.800
We are going to travel from the top 
to the bottom

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.200
of that inclined cable 
to get over the river.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.100
I’m scared of height.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.220
Hopefully, I can zipline over Chay river
to win my fear

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.220
and have an 
astonishing experience.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.980
Bend your legs!

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:48.980
That’s right.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.620
Everything is just great 
when you fly over the river.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.760
Thu Huong needs some minutes
to breath easily again

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.120
after ziplining over the Chay River.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.280
And now, it’s perfect time for me
to enjoy my fantastic game.
