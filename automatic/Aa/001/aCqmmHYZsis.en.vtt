stuck on it's layered like like that

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.930 
stuck on it's layered like like that
anyways<00:00:36.320> then<00:00:36.559> you<00:00:36.710> put<00:00:37.100> it<00:00:37.190> around<00:00:37.430> here

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
anyways then you put it around here

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.979 
anyways then you put it around here
right<00:00:38.840> up<00:00:38.960> around<00:00:39.500> that<00:00:39.829> sharp<00:00:40.489> part<00:00:40.820> and<00:00:41.809> that

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989

right up around that sharp part and that
cap<00:00:42.380> and<00:00:42.860> then<00:00:43.309> just<00:00:43.550> about<00:00:44.450> one<00:00:44.809> wrap<00:00:45.320> that's

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
cap and then just about one wrap that's

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.709 
cap and then just about one wrap that's
all<00:00:45.829> you<00:00:45.980> need<00:00:46.160> because<00:00:46.370> you<00:00:46.850> build<00:00:47.510> with<00:00:47.629> it

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719

all you need because you build with it
too<00:00:47.899> much<00:00:49.059> it's<00:00:50.059> not<00:00:50.120> going<00:00:50.390> to<00:00:50.450> work<00:00:50.570> closer

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870
