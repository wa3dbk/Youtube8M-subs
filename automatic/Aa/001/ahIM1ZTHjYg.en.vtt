action your action of the guitar okay so

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.999 
action your action of the guitar okay so
that<00:02:06.550> is<00:02:06.760> the<00:02:07.210> space<00:02:07.840> between<00:02:07.870> the<00:02:08.649> strings

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
that is the space between the strings

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.250 
that is the space between the strings
and<00:02:09.280> the<00:02:09.399> fret<00:02:09.580> board<00:02:09.610> all<00:02:10.209> right<00:02:10.269> right<00:02:11.080> in

between<00:02:11.379> here<00:02:11.739> and<00:02:11.830> that<00:02:11.920> will<00:02:12.670> depend<00:02:13.120> on<00:02:13.360> how

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
between here and that will depend on how

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.119 
between here and that will depend on how
hard<00:02:13.810> it<00:02:13.959> is<00:02:13.989> to<00:02:14.080> push<00:02:14.290> your<00:02:14.379> strings<00:02:14.680> down<00:02:14.860> to

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
hard it is to push your strings down to

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.880 
hard it is to push your strings down to
folks<00:02:15.430> we<00:02:16.090> also<00:02:16.360> went<00:02:16.959> over<00:02:17.110> what<00:02:17.560> this<00:02:17.680> little

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
folks we also went over what this little

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.190 
folks we also went over what this little
plastic<00:02:18.129> piece<00:02:18.430> is<00:02:18.790> here<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.209> saddle<00:02:19.720> when<00:02:20.110> we

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
plastic piece is here the saddle when we

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.289 
plastic piece is here the saddle when we
did<00:02:20.349> the<00:02:20.440> parts<00:02:20.680> of<00:02:20.799> the<00:02:20.890> guitar<00:02:20.980> I<00:02:21.459> know<00:02:22.060> it

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
did the parts of the guitar I know it

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:23.280 
did the parts of the guitar I know it
doesn't<00:02:22.450> seem<00:02:22.629> important<00:02:23.019> but<00:02:23.080> it<00:02:23.230> is

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
doesn't seem important but it is

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.420 
doesn't seem important but it is
important<00:02:23.650> in<00:02:23.709> all<00:02:23.799> the<00:02:23.890> parts<00:02:24.099> because<00:02:24.250> you

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
important in all the parts because you

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.979 
important in all the parts because you
can<00:02:24.580> fix<00:02:24.819> your<00:02:24.940> turn<00:02:25.209> make<00:02:25.390> it<00:02:25.510> easier<00:02:25.720> to<00:02:25.810> play

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
can fix your turn make it easier to play

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:27.809 
can fix your turn make it easier to play
if<00:02:26.080> you<00:02:26.200> know<00:02:26.379> all<00:02:26.739> the<00:02:26.980> different<00:02:27.099> sections

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
if you know all the different sections

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.619 
if you know all the different sections
of<00:02:28.120> it<00:02:28.269> so<00:02:28.810> this<00:02:29.620> piece<00:02:29.890> here<00:02:30.310> will<00:02:31.239> come<00:02:31.480> out

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
of it so this piece here will come out

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.170 
of it so this piece here will come out
and<00:02:31.870> you<00:02:31.930> can<00:02:32.860> lower<00:02:33.370> your<00:02:33.550> strings<00:02:33.910> if<00:02:34.090> you

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
and you can lower your strings if you

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.820 
and you can lower your strings if you
sand<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.840> little<00:02:35.050> piece<00:02:35.230> down<00:02:35.410> and<00:02:35.470> make<00:02:35.800> it

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
sand the little piece down and make it

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:36.480 
sand the little piece down and make it
small

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
small

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.180 
small
now<00:02:36.850> that's<00:02:37.090> depending<00:02:37.630> on<00:02:37.870> how<00:02:38.830> close<00:02:38.950> your

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
now that's depending on how close your

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
now that's depending on how close your
strings<00:02:39.400> are<00:02:39.460> to<00:02:39.580> the<00:02:39.670> fretboard<00:02:39.880> you<00:02:40.090> don't

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
strings are to the fretboard you don't

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.550 
strings are to the fretboard you don't
want<00:02:40.330> to<00:02:40.390> go<00:02:40.450> too<00:02:40.510> low<00:02:40.810> as<00:02:40.960> well<00:02:41.110> but<00:02:41.260> it<00:02:41.380> does

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
want to go too low as well but it does

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.530 
want to go too low as well but it does
make<00:02:41.770> it<00:02:41.890> so<00:02:41.920> much<00:02:42.190> easier<00:02:42.370> if<00:02:42.790> your<00:02:43.180> strings

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
make it so much easier if your strings

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.410 
make it so much easier if your strings
are<00:02:43.750> closer<00:02:44.140> to<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:44.650> frets<00:02:44.980> now<00:02:45.610> I<00:02:45.640> was<00:02:46.150> going

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
are closer to the frets now I was going

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.300 
are closer to the frets now I was going
to<00:02:46.660> teach<00:02:46.960> you<00:02:47.170> guys<00:02:47.200> how<00:02:47.380> to<00:02:47.620> change<00:02:47.950> strings
