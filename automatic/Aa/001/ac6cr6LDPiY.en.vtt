 I bring another video for you, let's say 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.120
 in what is the revised and in a boxing 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.430
 of this in h2 or audio a few headphones 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.670
 Warren truss resistant to water and 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.300
 resistant to sweat but before 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.369
 get into what their 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.480
 most relevant features we are going to 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.009
 open it 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.800
 although already the box once we go 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:23.910
 to leave it this deepened plastic and 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.099
 well here we have what are the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.220
 hearing aids which we will remove in a 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.140
 moment and its respective microphone we are going 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.850
 to read your specifications here to 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.180
 real the water plus water resistant 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.430
 and resistant to sweat and to attract them 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.140
 they show us what a guy is by using what 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.120
 what are the hearing aids and good is not a 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.220
 hearing aid will serve us for example if 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.010
 you are an athlete that you like to run at 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.450
 taste you like to walk and you go to 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.710
 ensure that sweat is not going to hurt you 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.750
 what is the operation of the 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.050
 hearing aids do not have when you have and 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.510
 for obesity between sweat or water 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.059
 here they tell us what is 100 guard 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.010
 Water resistant and 100% resistant to 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.800
 sweat tells us that technology 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.619
 patented ensures 100% 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.619
 running under water up to 3.6 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:14.340
 meters you can not access the 306 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.479
 meters or if you would not already be 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.460
 risking what is wrong 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.610
 one headset operation 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.479
 Normal office does not have more than 2 minutes 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.880
 it has no more than 3 meters so to speak 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.920
 then you will not fail what the 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.920
 Hearing aids inside a pool you can 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.929
 swim below the pool not that 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.060
 only above but you can 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:37.990
 swim below and listening to music and 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.820
 It's not going to hurt you, it's the 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.369
 also working what news in 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.130
 clear communication you can speak for 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.840
 the hearing aids while you're below 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.970
 of the water has a microphone with the 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.130
 visual lopez use for while you're 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.500
 under water it will not work 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.290
 also but it's still going to work 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.900
 and it's not going to hurt I'm interested 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.180
 under water one of these 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.220
 specifications let's do what it is 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.040
 made the hearing aids we go to the 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.330
 road to see how they are ready here 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.060
 they do not have what they add to their 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:13.440
 contacts that the company is marking 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:16.200
 create and put humans of how to use not 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.760
 We will read it on this opportunity here 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.430
 they do not have what the hearing aids are like 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.050
 so then we are going to withdraw first 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.890
 general what the four of us come 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.450
 different types or four pairs of commas 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.580
 depending on the size of the ear or the 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.860
 ear canal to accommodate 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.300
 perfectly and do not get in the way of what 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.770
 what is the ear then they have the size 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:41.470
 xs 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:42.450
 s and xl then what will it serve 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.270
 for 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.519
 your ear then if this is what they want 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.200
 by default , they will work for us 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.239
 some of these will work for you 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.790
 that we are will send you what is a bullfighter 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.040
 and have not bothered you, let's take 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.480
 the hearing aids of your package today wants 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.480
 here we have what the hearing aids are 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:06.630
 an ordinary hearing aid and here what 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:09.180
 which says the sensor mark or the h2o of the 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.730
 reference and good are a few hearing aids 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.620
 ordinary and the only difference is 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.210
 that these are going to be used to be more 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.330
 under the water in just that they make them 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:21.390
 wonderful here the logo and the 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.860
 normal hearing aids here also in what 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.880
 what is the option to be able to do 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.180
 calls 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.400
 we have a button and here the microphone 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.590
 that can not be appreciated very well but 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.660
 that there is this microphone to be able to talk 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.030
 out there while we're in the water and not 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.820
 will affect performance in this 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.830
 part a clip to place your shirt on 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.080
 the pants where you prefer it for 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.420
 that fits and does not move at the time 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.340
 to make a call to stay 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.410
 still and do not move what is the 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.510
 microphone and good at this end 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.850
 we see what is found of 305 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.280
 millimeters to place it in any 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.140
 device that has the ability 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.569
 submerge below the water to 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.510
 listen to music to place them there and 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.680
 good functionality perfectly 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.209
 equally if you want to see how they work 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.760
 these hearing aids are we going to stop what 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.290
 which is a video for you to go and 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.330
 lubiÃ¡n we are going to leave you there what is 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.430
 a notation can click and it does not go 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.840
 to leave what is this video they are 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.730
 opens a new tab a new 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.250
 window for you to go and see 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.690
 this video and good these hearing aids 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.360
 complement with our product that 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.910
 they make themselves which is a 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.590
 local job and phone bag and it gives you 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.050
 the space to place the hearing aids 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.270
 so then the bag will be brought 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.540
 in another in another opportunity perhaps 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.250
 morning and good to experience what 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.020
 this one has realized is what is the 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.510
 bag and the bag will also serve you 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.520
 to take pictures below the water and 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:48.060
 good especially you can place it 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.390

 need to buy the bag but if you already
