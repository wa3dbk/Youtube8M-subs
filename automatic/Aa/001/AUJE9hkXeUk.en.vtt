00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.240
 We did not expect this release 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.689

 presentation is in a smaller box with a 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.560

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.850

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.510
 tape by gluing the trays one on top of the 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:13.239

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.639

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:46.709

 10x technicians in every detail to 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:04:00.400
 you leave this presentation is better 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:02.380
 that the common burst in the end 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.180
 nor the cars in the edition of vicodin and 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.200
 You will see that I did not watch. 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:11.980

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:15.710

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.510
 even with exclusivity, right? 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:48.440
 I think no one has made video yet. 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:50.570
 box estimates that these two 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.770
 Last season to 8 to see how it is 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:56.720
 what is 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:05:06.800
 underneath them here looks only called reason 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:11.720
 there in the season closing does not 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:16.490
 had in and behind it with the apple is just 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:20.840
 top side bump there with numbering 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.530

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.700
 return 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:28.550
 the box here we are back after 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.740
 failed during the past week because the 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.060
 presenter was very vocal. 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.600
 weird 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:38.840
 we are back then a series 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:41.090
 complete house in English in Brazil if 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:44.120
 How did you like the young man? 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.020
 scheme was if you ask the first 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.270
 time here 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:50.360
