the reason why she got hit by car is
because<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.329> let<00:01:57.869> her<00:01:58.049> out<00:01:58.259> after<00:01:58.590> i<00:01:58.860> feed<00:01:59.219> her

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
because I let her out after i feed her

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.420 
because I let her out after i feed her
in<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.670> mornings<00:02:00.680> not<00:02:01.680> going<00:02:01.979> like<00:02:02.280> the

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
in the mornings not going like the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.959 
in the mornings not going like the
afternoon<00:02:02.850> time<00:02:03.590> because<00:02:04.590> you<00:02:05.430> know<00:02:05.729> she<00:02:05.820> was

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
afternoon time because you know she was

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.789 
afternoon time because you know she was
a<00:02:06.090> stray<00:02:06.450> before<00:02:06.840> i<00:02:06.869> got<00:02:07.020> her<00:02:07.200> so<00:02:07.380> she<00:02:07.439> had<00:02:07.619> all

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
a stray before i got her so she had all

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.790 
a stray before i got her so she had all
her<00:02:07.829> cat<00:02:08.129> friends<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.729> stuff<00:02:09.330> like<00:02:09.539> that<00:02:09.599> so<00:02:10.050> i

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
her cat friends and stuff like that so i

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.160 
her cat friends and stuff like that so i
did<00:02:11.220> allow<00:02:11.640> her<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:11.940> go

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
did allow her to go

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.809 
did allow her to go
outside<00:02:12.470> like<00:02:12.740> I<00:02:12.770> do<00:02:12.890> allow<00:02:13.280> her<00:02:13.430> go<00:02:13.610> outside

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
outside like I do allow her go outside

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.940 
outside like I do allow her go outside
every<00:02:14.030> day<00:02:14.209> and<00:02:15.080> play<00:02:15.260> with<00:02:15.440> them<00:02:15.650> for<00:02:15.860> a<00:02:15.890> while

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
every day and play with them for a while

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.490 
every day and play with them for a while
and<00:02:16.190> then<00:02:16.310> come<00:02:16.520> back<00:02:16.550> in<00:02:16.940> in<00:02:17.480> some<00:02:18.140> bed<00:02:18.380> is

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
and then come back in in some bed is

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.530 
and then come back in in some bed is
fine<00:02:18.770> but<00:02:19.400> I<00:02:19.430> guess<00:02:19.700> when<00:02:20.120> they<00:02:20.209> were<00:02:20.300> coming

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
fine but I guess when they were coming

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.040 
fine but I guess when they were coming
into<00:02:20.900> their<00:02:21.140> driveway<00:02:21.349> they<00:02:21.770> hit<00:02:22.069> her<00:02:23.050> yeah

reason why do not take the request is

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.580 
reason why do not take the request is
because<00:03:58.640> when<00:03:59.180> i<00:03:59.209> first<00:03:59.510> started<00:03:59.840> youtube<00:04:00.290> I

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
because when i first started youtube I

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.259 
because when i first started youtube I
was<00:04:01.430> taking<00:04:01.730> requests<00:04:02.060> just<00:04:02.510> fine<00:04:03.670> but<00:04:04.670> they

was taking requests just fine but they

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:07.630 
was taking requests just fine but they
started<00:04:05.870> to<00:04:05.959> pile<00:04:06.200> up<00:04:06.470> and<00:04:06.739> as<00:04:06.890> I<00:04:07.069> go<00:04:07.310> I<00:04:07.340> don't
