00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
question how much wood would a woodchuck

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.770 
question how much wood would a woodchuck
chuck<00:00:10.950> if<00:00:11.250> a<00:00:11.490> woodchuck<00:00:11.730> could<00:00:11.969> chuck<00:00:12.179> wood<00:00:12.389> no

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780

people that's it no not that either why

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.140 
people that's it no not that either why
do<00:00:22.080> we<00:00:22.289> cry<00:00:22.529> when<00:00:22.800> we<00:00:22.980> shower<00:00:23.220> no<00:00:23.580> it's<00:00:23.789> um<00:00:23.970> is

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
do we cry when we shower no it's um is

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.720 
do we cry when we shower no it's um is
there<00:00:24.269> life<00:00:24.510> on<00:00:24.689> other<00:00:24.750> planets<00:00:24.960> oh<00:00:25.730> okay

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
there life on other planets oh okay

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.490 
there life on other planets oh okay
that's<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:27.000> way<00:00:27.240> better<00:00:27.269> question<00:00:27.990> than<00:00:28.019> mine<00:00:28.349> I

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
that's a way better question than mine I

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.259 
that's a way better question than mine I
think<00:00:28.650> it's<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.859> hot<00:00:29.039> water<00:00:29.369> or<00:00:29.670> how<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:29.939> know

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
think it's the hot water or how you know

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.730 
think it's the hot water or how you know
you<00:00:30.330> feel<00:00:30.599> like<00:00:30.720> you're<00:00:30.900> being<00:00:30.990> flooded<00:00:31.439> while

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
you feel like you're being flooded while

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.799 
you feel like you're being flooded while
standing<00:00:32.130> like<00:00:32.460> an<00:00:32.550> all-consuming<00:00:32.940> sensation

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
standing like an all-consuming sensation

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.240 
standing like an all-consuming sensation
all<00:00:33.930> right<00:00:34.079> well<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.350> turns<00:00:34.530> out<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:34.829> our<00:00:35.040> big

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
all right well it turns out that our big

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.639 
all right well it turns out that our big
old<00:00:35.430> galaxy<00:00:35.940> contains<00:00:36.360> at<00:00:36.510> least<00:00:36.540> two<00:00:36.899> billion

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
old galaxy contains at least two billion

does<00:00:45.239> this<00:00:45.329> mean<00:00:45.539> there's<00:00:45.719> two<00:00:46.020> billion<00:00:46.649> us<00:00:46.890> is

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
does this mean there's two billion us is

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.520 
does this mean there's two billion us is
out<00:00:47.610> there<00:00:47.879> now<00:00:48.210> two<00:00:48.570> billion<00:00:48.870> Earth's<00:00:49.079> know

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
out there now two billion Earth's know

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.680 
out there now two billion Earth's know
maybe<00:00:50.280> we<00:00:50.579> don't<00:00:50.670> know<00:00:50.850> Joe<00:00:51.120> that's<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.539> little

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
maybe we don't know Joe that's a little

problem<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.479> they<00:01:27.659> be<00:01:27.720> like<00:01:27.900> super<00:01:28.350> far<00:01:28.560> away<00:01:28.590> I

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
problem is they be like super far away I

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.340 
problem is they be like super far away I
don't<00:01:29.250> think<00:01:29.310> we'd<00:01:29.549> make<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.850> no<00:01:30.180> job<00:01:30.479> they'd

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
don't think we'd make it no job they'd

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.830 
don't think we'd make it no job they'd
send<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.740> pro<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.369> know<00:01:32.520> like<00:01:32.729> like<00:01:32.880> John<00:01:33.420> probe

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.140 
and if all goes well it'll let us know
just<00:01:40.470> how<00:01:40.650> habitable<00:01:41.220> these<00:01:41.400> planets<00:01:41.850> really

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
just how habitable these planets really

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.179 
just how habitable these planets really
are<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.840> know<00:01:42.960> we<00:01:43.140> can<00:01:43.320> never<00:01:43.649> go<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.950> them

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
are so you know we can never go to them

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.620 
are so you know we can never go to them
because<00:01:44.340> we<00:01:44.790> won't<00:01:44.880> be<00:01:45.060> able<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.270> make<00:01:45.420> it

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
because we won't be able to make it

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.940 
because we won't be able to make it
