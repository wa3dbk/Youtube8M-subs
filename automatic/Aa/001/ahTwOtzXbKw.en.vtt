support network in this segment we're

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.910 
support network in this segment we're
going<00:00:08.940> to<00:00:09.000> cover<00:00:09.240> a<00:00:09.660> couple<00:00:09.780> of<00:00:10.200> changes<00:00:10.740> that

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
going to cover a couple of changes that

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.209 
going to cover a couple of changes that
we're<00:00:11.100> making<00:00:11.129> to<00:00:11.520> the<00:00:12.080> jiffy<00:00:13.080> model<00:00:13.379> 40<00:00:13.770> Pro

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
we're making to the jiffy model 40 Pro

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.910 
we're making to the jiffy model 40 Pro
for<00:00:14.549> propane-powered<00:00:15.180> ice<00:00:15.600> drill<00:00:15.959> the<00:00:16.890> first

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
for propane-powered ice drill the first

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.070 
for propane-powered ice drill the first
change<00:00:17.490> we're<00:00:17.699> going<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.880> cover<00:00:18.119> is<00:00:18.510> in<00:00:18.720> regard

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
change we're going to cover is in regard

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.890 
change we're going to cover is in regard
to<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.700> propane<00:00:20.700> field<00:00:21.030> delivery<00:00:21.450> system

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
to the propane field delivery system

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.110 
to the propane field delivery system
we've<00:00:22.320> really<00:00:22.650> simplified<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.490> system<00:00:23.940> by

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:24.120 
we've really simplified the system by

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.760 
we've really simplified the system by
mounting<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.720> directly<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.440> carburetor

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:25.770 
mounting it directly to the carburetor

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.740 
mounting it directly to the carburetor
then<00:00:26.670> there's<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.970> short<00:00:27.270> field<00:00:27.539> line<00:00:27.720> that

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
then there's a short field line that

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.810 
then there's a short field line that
mounts<00:00:28.320> directly<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.950> the<00:00:29.070> propane<00:00:29.490> regulator

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
mounts directly to the propane regulator

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.479 
mounts directly to the propane regulator
and<00:00:30.390> again<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:31.320> whole<00:00:31.500> system<00:00:31.830> really<00:00:32.309> makes

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
and again that whole system really makes

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.389 
and again that whole system really makes
it<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.879> lot<00:00:33.420> simpler<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.230> easy<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:35.190> either

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
it a lot simpler and easy to either

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.330 
it a lot simpler and easy to either
assemble<00:00:36.000> or<00:00:36.210> disassemble<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:37.560> propane<00:00:38.070> tank

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
assemble or disassemble the propane tank

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.000 
assemble or disassemble the propane tank
from<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.790> unit<00:00:39.060> itself<00:00:39.650> which<00:00:40.650> I<00:00:40.829> will

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
from the unit itself which I will

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.370 
from the unit itself which I will
demonstrate<00:00:41.220> shortly<00:00:42.060> the<00:00:42.840> other<00:00:42.989> change

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.380 
demonstrate shortly the other change

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.590 
demonstrate shortly the other change
we've<00:00:43.620> made<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.310> propane<00:00:44.550> tank<00:00:45.120> cradle

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
we've made is in the propane tank cradle

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.299 
we've made is in the propane tank cradle
and<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.320> retention<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.880> propane<00:00:48.300> tank

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
and the retention of the propane tank

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.860 
and the retention of the propane tank
the<00:00:50.309> first<00:00:50.579> thing<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:50.790> you<00:00:51.120> need<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.450> do<00:00:51.690> is

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
the first thing that you need to do is

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.220 
the first thing that you need to do is
remove<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.910> protective<00:00:53.910> cover<00:00:54.360> from<00:00:55.079> the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
remove the protective cover from the

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.110 
remove the protective cover from the
regulator<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.309> take<00:00:57.300> your<00:00:57.450> propane<00:00:57.899> tank

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
regulator and take your propane tank

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.380 
regulator and take your propane tank
mounted<00:01:00.120> directly<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.719> regulator<00:01:02.390> turn

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
mounted directly to the regulator turn

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.199 
mounted directly to the regulator turn
it<00:01:03.510> on<00:01:06.740> make<00:01:07.740> sure<00:01:07.920> it's<00:01:08.069> nice<00:01:08.219> and<00:01:08.249> snug<00:01:08.609> that

00:01:09.199 --> 00:01:09.209 
it on make sure it's nice and snug that

00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:11.449
