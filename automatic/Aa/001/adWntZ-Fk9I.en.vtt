00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.120
Oh I should mention before I even get

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.580
near different dimensions

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.640
you may have noticed my voice is not a hundred percent, right

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.300
it's somewhere between zero and one voice at the moment

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.000
and that's because I am a maths teacher

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.420
and on Monday my maths teacher-ness got the better of me

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.840
I was coming out of the pub on Monday night

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.860
having given a maths talk, it's okay

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.700
true story, right, so I came out of the pub and I'm walking down the street with my girlfriend

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.800
who is, who is non-fictitious

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.480
*audience laughter*

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.900
not strictly speaking a joke, but thanks a lot

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.060
and I'd taken my iPhone out to send a text, to reply to a friend of mine

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.700
and I wasn't looking up, I was looking at my phone, and a guy on a bike

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.160
because it was about 10:30 at night, a guy on a bike came swooping through and tried to snatch my phone

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.300
he wasn't completely successful, he merely managed to knock it out of my hand, right

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.800
but then there was another one, right, they've learned to work in teams

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.900
*audience laughter* practice or something, right

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.280
so the other one came through, picked it up, he was on foot, picked it up and bolted with it, right

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.180
and the teacher part of my brain just turned on, right

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.000
so I just I sprinted after them right, shouting "How dare you!  I'm very disappointed with your behavior!"

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.600
*audience laughter and applause* which I thought was appropriate

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.380
I continued yelling it very loudly in my teacher voice saying teacher sentences

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.940
which is why my voice is not one hundred percent

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.700
what was good was eventually I managed to catch up with the guy, right

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:47.720
and myself and 11 other random members of the public, they heard the teacher voice and went "We must do what he says

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.340
*audience laughter* "better stop that guy"

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.040
and the guy on the bike didn't get away either, for the record

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.820
a guy coming by on a scooter went "Oh yeah" and just went into the guy and took him out

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.700
*audience laughter* like Grand Theft Auto, right

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.660
so he ran off and left his bike, so you know, free bike, right

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.760
we cornered the guy, I confiscated my own phone

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.940
[teacher voice] "Give me back my phone, give me back my phone"

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.820
and then while we waited for the police to show up I proceeded to lecture him about community

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.400
I was just, the cops arrived just as I was explaining why I teach maths

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.600
and give free community lectures so people can advance themselves and have a better future

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.020
and [indistinguishable] things like this

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.920
and the cops pulled in, he has never looked so pleased to see the police in his life

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:41.240
so I spent all of Monday night yelling to a guy

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.640
and I had to go to the police station to put all the reports in, it took a long time so

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.180
I was a bit sleep deprived, and my voice--because I couldn't speak the next day, right--

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.080
but my voice is pretty much back, so you're gonna have to bear with me

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.180
during this talk

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.820
what??!

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.620
what'd the other people think? Oh we got high fives all around, everyone was like "Yeah!"

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.320
and they all, this is it because someone tried to rob me, right, and

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.420
I ended up with a better sense of community afterwards, right

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.580
and the system works, because all the people went "We're not taking this" we all ran after him

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.940
we didn't hurt the guy, we just sat him down, I lectured him about the importance of community

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.660
and then the police showed up, took him away, he was processed

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.400
and charged with a theft, like the system works

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.280
right, well as far as I'm concerned he's lucky I didn't phone his mum

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:38.920
so anyway, that's why my voice will come and go, but bear with me, I'm sure we'll get there

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.440
so the talk, the actual, there are some maths here, don't worry

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.560
the actual talk about the fourth dimension, I'm not gonna leap straight into the fourth dimension

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.260
we're gonna have a bit of a build-up before we get there
