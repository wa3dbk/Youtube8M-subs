them be able to make these new cameras
is<00:00:42.809> really<00:00:43.020> something<00:00:43.320> that's<00:00:43.379> kind<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.710> neat

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
is really something that's kind of neat

however what most people don't know is

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.080 
however what most people don't know is
that<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.340> many<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.579> their<00:00:47.730> cameras<00:00:48.030> would

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
that so many of their cameras would

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.090 
that so many of their cameras would
actually<00:00:48.360> based<00:00:48.539> off<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.809> other<00:00:49.170> cameras<00:00:49.620> now

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
they're obviously the obvious ones like

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.439 
they're obviously the obvious ones like
the<00:00:52.050> loma<00:00:52.770> LC<00:00:53.070> plus<00:00:53.399> which<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:53.879> based<00:00:54.149> off<00:00:54.390> of

camera<00:01:37.619> is<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.280> sprocket<00:01:38.790> rocket<00:01:39.229> now<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.259> said

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
camera is the sprocket rocket now I said

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.230 
camera is the sprocket rocket now I said
I<00:01:40.530> don't<00:01:40.619> have<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.829> picture<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.520> don't<00:01:41.880> have<00:01:42.060> one

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
I don't have a picture I don't have one

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.280 
I don't have a picture I don't have one
so<00:01:42.659> here's<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.110> picture<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.409> one

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
actually lomography acknowledged this in

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.370 
actually lomography acknowledged this in

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.450 
the book that came with a las idea and
this<00:01:52.500> was<00:01:52.620> kind<00:01:52.740> of<00:01:52.800> a<00:01:52.890> first<00:01:53.100> because<00:01:53.370> they

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
this was kind of a first because they

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.800 
this was kind of a first because they
really<00:01:53.700> haven't<00:01:53.880> done<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.210> all<00:01:54.450> up<00:01:54.660> before

now<00:02:18.390> you<00:02:19.020> might<00:02:19.170> be<00:02:19.260> thinking<00:02:19.290> that<00:02:19.590> sounds<00:02:19.920> a

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
now you might be thinking that sounds a

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.380 
now you might be thinking that sounds a
lot<00:02:20.250> like<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.550> longer<00:02:20.820> fee<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.090> that<00:02:21.209> might

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
lot like the longer fee and that might

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.540 
lot like the longer fee and that might
be<00:02:21.570> why<00:02:21.780> part<00:02:22.620> of<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.770> reason<00:02:22.890> is<00:02:23.160> that<00:02:23.190> they

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
be why part of the reason is that they

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.310 
be why part of the reason is that they
chose<00:02:23.940> these<00:02:24.270> cameras<00:02:24.720> to<00:02:24.840> base<00:02:25.020> their

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
chose these cameras to base their

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.050 
chose these cameras to base their
cameras<00:02:25.770> off<00:02:25.890> of<00:02:26.100> because<00:02:26.640> of<00:02:26.760> my<00:02:26.850> face

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
cameras off of because of my face

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.130 
cameras off of because of my face
cameras<00:02:27.360> are<00:02:27.480> all<00:02:27.570> pretty<00:02:27.780> much<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.020> same

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
cameras are all pretty much the same

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.490 
cameras are all pretty much the same
thing<00:02:28.530> big<00:02:29.100> shutter<00:02:29.340> speed<00:02:29.610> fixed<00:02:30.300> aperture

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.590 
thing big shutter speed fixed aperture
and<00:02:31.500> very<00:02:32.010> little<00:02:32.220> in<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.670> way<00:02:32.700> of<00:02:32.850> actual

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
and very little in the way of actual

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.660 
and very little in the way of actual
settings<00:02:34.080> so<00:02:34.770> we've<00:02:34.860> got<00:02:35.010> this<00:02:35.160> one<00:02:35.340> to<00:02:35.459> start

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
settings so we've got this one to start

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.610 
settings so we've got this one to start
with<00:02:35.730> back<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.510> sprocket<00:02:36.900> rocket<00:02:36.930> that

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
with back to the sprocket rocket that

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.320 
with back to the sprocket rocket that
camera<00:02:37.920> is<00:02:37.950> based<00:02:38.280> off<00:02:38.430> of<00:02:38.489> one<00:02:38.760> of<00:02:38.880> these<00:02:38.970> the

camera is based off of one of these the

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.780 
camera is based off of one of these the
Falcon<00:02:39.720> miniature<00:02:40.170> camera<00:02:40.560> this<00:02:41.250> one<00:02:41.430> is<00:02:41.640> in

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
Falcon miniature camera this one is in

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.350 
Falcon miniature camera this one is in
the<00:02:41.880> box<00:02:42.290> this<00:02:43.290> is<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.560> deluxe<00:02:43.800> model<00:02:44.360> now

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
the box this is the deluxe model now

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.850 
the box this is the deluxe model now
there<00:02:45.540> are<00:02:45.570> actually<00:02:45.900> quite<00:02:45.930> a<00:02:46.170> few<00:02:46.530> different

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
there are actually quite a few different

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.650 
there are actually quite a few different
versions<00:02:46.890> of<00:02:47.280> these<00:02:47.430> mine<00:02:47.910> isn't<00:02:48.270> the<00:02:48.510> one

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
versions of these mine isn't the one

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.810 
versions of these mine isn't the one
that<00:02:48.930> is<00:02:49.140> directly<00:02:49.709> related<00:02:49.950> to<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.459> sprocket

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
that is directly related to the sprocket

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.550 
that is directly related to the sprocket
rocket<00:02:50.850> there's<00:02:51.269> one<00:02:51.480> that<00:02:51.600> looks<00:02:51.750> quite<00:02:52.530> a

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
rocket there's one that looks quite a

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.820 
rocket there's one that looks quite a
bit<00:02:52.769> more<00:02:52.950> like<00:02:53.310> it<00:02:53.630> but<00:02:54.630> for<00:02:55.380> all<00:02:55.470> intents<00:02:55.739> and

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
bit more like it but for all intents and

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.340 
bit more like it but for all intents and
purposes<00:02:56.220> it's<00:02:56.489> the<00:02:56.580> same<00:02:56.790> camera<00:02:57.350> now

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
purposes it's the same camera now

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.140 
purposes it's the same camera now
interestingly<00:02:58.650> enough<00:02:59.220> it's<00:02:59.489> actually<00:02:59.970> about

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
interestingly enough it's actually about

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.199 
interestingly enough it's actually about
the<00:03:00.420> same<00:03:00.450> camera<00:03:00.959> as<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:02.430> candor<00:03:02.790> candid

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
the same camera as the candor candid

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.890 
the same camera as the candor candid
they<00:03:03.720> are<00:03:03.780> both<00:03:04.010> 127<00:03:05.010> roll<00:03:05.190> film<00:03:05.400> cameras<00:03:05.900> both

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
they are both 127 roll film cameras both

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.740 
they are both 127 roll film cameras both
take<00:03:07.230> i<00:03:07.769> believe<00:03:08.580> it's<00:03:08.760> four<00:03:09.060> and<00:03:09.180> a<00:03:09.209> half<00:03:09.239> by

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
take i believe it's four and a half by

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.350 
take i believe it's four and a half by
two<00:03:10.350> and<00:03:10.470> a<00:03:10.500> half<00:03:10.590> or<00:03:10.799> something<00:03:11.090> image<00:03:12.090> and

two and a half or something image and

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.390 
two and a half or something image and
roughly<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.110> same<00:03:13.260> weds<00:03:13.500> now<00:03:14.130> they<00:03:14.250> call

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
roughly the same weds now they call

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.770 
roughly the same weds now they call
these<00:03:14.580> candidate<00:03:15.030> or<00:03:15.090> snapshot<00:03:15.480> cameras

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
these candidate or snapshot cameras

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.670 
these candidate or snapshot cameras
because<00:03:15.959> there<00:03:16.380> was<00:03:16.560> none<00:03:16.739> of<00:03:16.860> this

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.260 

you<00:03:20.680> and<00:03:20.860> just<00:03:20.980> walk<00:03:21.130> up<00:03:21.310> and<00:03:21.460> you<00:03:21.700> can<00:03:21.880> frame

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
you and just walk up and you can frame

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.660 
you and just walk up and you can frame
it<00:03:22.300> and<00:03:22.830> pull<00:03:23.830> the<00:03:23.920> shutter<00:03:24.100> and<00:03:24.340> there<00:03:24.580> it

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
it and pull the shutter and there it

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.460 
it and pull the shutter and there it
goes<00:03:24.700> you're<00:03:25.480> ready<00:03:25.660> you<00:03:26.020> just<00:03:26.080> took<00:03:26.350> your

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
goes you're ready you just took your

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.260 
goes you're ready you just took your
picture<00:03:26.680> and<00:03:27.040> then<00:03:27.700> you<00:03:27.760> had<00:03:27.850> to<00:03:27.880> advance<00:03:28.090> the

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
picture and then you had to advance the

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.440 
picture and then you had to advance the
film<00:03:28.420> these<00:03:29.020> actually<00:03:29.440> both<00:03:29.590> have<00:03:29.830> the<00:03:30.010> same

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
film these actually both have the same

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.180 
film these actually both have the same
nothing<00:03:31.450> actually<00:03:31.600> not<00:03:32.260> the<00:03:32.380> exact<00:03:32.680> same<00:03:32.860> but

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
nothing actually not the exact same but

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.300 
nothing actually not the exact same but
a<00:03:33.220> pretty<00:03:33.820> pretty<00:03:34.600> dang<00:03:34.840> close<00:03:35.050> 50<00:03:35.890> millimeter

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
a pretty pretty dang close 50 millimeter

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.880 
a pretty pretty dang close 50 millimeter
single<00:03:36.700> element<00:03:37.060> lens<00:03:37.840> it's<00:03:38.560> going<00:03:38.740> to<00:03:38.770> be

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
single element lens it's going to be

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.170 
single element lens it's going to be
around<00:03:38.980> eftate<00:03:39.580> to<00:03:40.540> f/11<00:03:40.750> if<00:03:41.590> i<00:03:41.740> had<00:03:41.890> to<00:03:41.980> guess

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
around eftate to f/11 if i had to guess

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.310 
around eftate to f/11 if i had to guess
and<00:03:43.180> these<00:03:43.390> cameras<00:03:43.750> were<00:03:43.900> not<00:03:43.930> known<00:03:44.290> for

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
and these cameras were not known for

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.560 
and these cameras were not known for
their<00:03:44.650> quality<00:03:44.710> much<00:03:45.670> like<00:03:45.940> lomography

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
their quality much like lomography

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.020 
their quality much like lomography
cameras<00:03:46.930> ironically<00:03:47.490> for<00:03:48.490> instance<00:03:48.730> with<00:03:48.940> the

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
cameras ironically for instance with the

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.820 
cameras ironically for instance with the
Falcon<00:03:49.390> miniature<00:03:49.780> in<00:03:49.960> the<00:03:50.050> instructions<00:03:50.590> it

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
Falcon miniature in the instructions it

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.250 
Falcon miniature in the instructions it
actually<00:03:51.010> says<00:03:51.340> don't<00:03:52.300> even<00:03:52.510> trust<00:03:52.720> this<00:03:52.930> it's

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
actually says don't even trust this it's

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.320 
actually says don't even trust this it's
going<00:03:53.680> to<00:03:53.800> be<00:03:53.890> more<00:03:54.370> than<00:03:54.430> what<00:03:54.760> you<00:03:54.790> see<00:03:55.090> in

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
going to be more than what you see in

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.060 
going to be more than what you see in
the<00:03:55.510> viewfinder<00:03:55.690> so<00:03:56.380> you<00:03:56.470> just<00:03:56.680> kind<00:03:56.830> of<00:03:56.920> use

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
the viewfinder so you just kind of use

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.650 
the viewfinder so you just kind of use
this<00:03:57.220> for<00:03:57.430> framing<00:03:57.640> and<00:03:57.910> to<00:03:57.970> make<00:03:58.090> sure<00:03:58.120> your

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
this for framing and to make sure your

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.150 
this for framing and to make sure your
horizon<00:03:59.380> straight<00:04:00.420> that's<00:04:01.420> really<00:04:01.660> about<00:04:01.780> it

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
horizon straight that's really about it

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.220 
horizon straight that's really about it
and<00:04:03.160> much<00:04:03.459> like<00:04:03.490> many<00:04:04.420> roll<00:04:04.660> film<00:04:04.900> cameras

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
and much like many roll film cameras

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.440 
and much like many roll film cameras
that<00:04:05.350> are<00:04:05.380> cheaper<00:04:05.860> as<00:04:06.550> the<00:04:06.760> two<00:04:06.910> red<00:04:07.090> windows

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
that are cheaper as the two red windows

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.080 
that are cheaper as the two red windows
on<00:04:07.570> the<00:04:07.600> back<00:04:07.690> as<00:04:08.020> you<00:04:08.110> advance<00:04:08.709> the<00:04:09.010> frame<00:04:09.220> you

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
on the back as you advance the frame you

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.820 
on the back as you advance the frame you
see<00:04:10.360> the<00:04:10.570> number<00:04:10.780> one<00:04:10.930> here<00:04:11.230> you<00:04:11.590> would<00:04:11.680> take<00:04:11.770> a

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
see the number one here you would take a

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.680 
see the number one here you would take a
picture<00:04:12.160> you<00:04:12.520> in<00:04:12.550> advance<00:04:12.910> the<00:04:13.150> number<00:04:13.360> one<00:04:13.540> to

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
picture you in advance the number one to

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.150 
picture you in advance the number one to
the<00:04:13.780> second<00:04:14.110> window<00:04:14.290> take<00:04:14.709> your<00:04:14.830> second

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
the second window take your second

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.500 
the second window take your second
picture<00:04:15.370> in<00:04:15.520> advance<00:04:15.640> until<00:04:16.030> it<00:04:16.209> says<00:04:16.330> number

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
picture in advance until it says number

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.150 
picture in advance until it says number
two<00:04:16.810> right<00:04:16.959> here<00:04:17.200> and<00:04:17.410> that's<00:04:17.829> how<00:04:17.919> you<00:04:18.010> would

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
two right here and that's how you would

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.840 
two right here and that's how you would
get<00:04:18.280> the<00:04:18.430> double<00:04:18.700> frames<00:04:19.650> 16<00:04:20.650> actually<00:04:20.890> per

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
get the double frames 16 actually per

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.760 
get the double frames 16 actually per
roll<00:04:22.210> film<00:04:22.540> which<00:04:22.750> back<00:04:23.169> of<00:04:23.320> the<00:04:23.380> day<00:04:23.530> was

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
roll film which back of the day was

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.490 
roll film which back of the day was
pretty<00:04:24.190> economical<00:04:24.810> so<00:04:25.810> if<00:04:26.080> you<00:04:26.169> didn't<00:04:26.410> have

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
pretty economical so if you didn't have

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.810 
pretty economical so if you didn't have
a<00:04:26.560> whole<00:04:26.740> lot<00:04:26.770> of<00:04:26.890> money<00:04:27.160> you<00:04:27.340> could<00:04:27.490> pick<00:04:27.610> one

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
a whole lot of money you could pick one

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.880 
a whole lot of money you could pick one
of<00:04:27.880> these<00:04:27.940> up<00:04:28.120> for<00:04:28.330> a<00:04:28.360> couple<00:04:28.660> bucks<00:04:28.810> and<00:04:29.680> pick

of<00:04:31.180> pictures<00:04:31.360> on<00:04:31.690> a<00:04:31.720> single<00:04:32.140> rule<00:04:32.320> which<00:04:32.830> was

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
of pictures on a single rule which was

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.560 
of pictures on a single rule which was
really<00:04:33.160> great<00:04:33.460> and<00:04:33.790> now<00:04:34.690> they<00:04:35.200> actually<00:04:35.710> and

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
some of these cameras actually got kind

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.560 
some of these cameras actually got kind
of<00:04:38.740> clever<00:04:39.070> again<00:04:40.060> with<00:04:40.180> the<00:04:40.270> Falcon

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
take-up spool but it also had this right

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.409 
take-up spool but it also had this right
here<00:04:51.130> which<00:04:51.280> was<00:04:51.460> actually<00:04:51.880> a<00:04:51.910> little<00:04:52.000> pocket

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
here which was actually a little pocket

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:53.790 
here which was actually a little pocket
where<00:04:52.690> you<00:04:52.780> would<00:04:52.930> take<00:04:53.110> another<00:04:53.320> roll<00:04:53.770> of

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
where you would take another roll of

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.590 
where you would take another roll of
film<00:04:54.040> if<00:04:54.310> you<00:04:54.700> had<00:04:54.880> one<00:04:55.000> and<00:04:55.240> you<00:04:55.300> didn't<00:04:55.479> want

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
film if you had one and you didn't want

00:06:18.739 --> 00:06:18.749 
they were cheap enough and they have

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:20.059 
they were cheap enough and they have
kind<00:06:19.019> of<00:06:19.050> an<00:06:19.169> interesting<00:06:19.349> history<00:06:19.830> bond

00:06:20.059 --> 00:06:20.069 
kind of an interesting history bond

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:21.110 
kind of an interesting history bond
which<00:06:20.339> is<00:06:20.430> what<00:06:20.580> I've<00:06:20.669> been<00:06:20.759> talking<00:06:20.939> about

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
which is what I've been talking about

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.259 
which is what I've been talking about
today<00:06:21.740> the<00:06:22.740> images<00:06:23.129> as<00:06:23.339> you<00:06:23.490> could<00:06:23.639> expect<00:06:23.759> are

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:24.269 
today the images as you could expect are

00:06:24.269 --> 00:06:27.019 
today the images as you could expect are
pretty<00:06:24.749> soft<00:06:24.990> have<00:06:25.529> a<00:06:25.559> lot<00:06:25.949> of<00:06:25.979> edge<00:06:26.399> blur<00:06:26.789> to

00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:27.029 
pretty soft have a lot of edge blur to

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:29.749 
pretty soft have a lot of edge blur to
them<00:06:27.209> heavy<00:06:27.659> thing<00:06:27.870> yet<00:06:28.309> which<00:06:29.309> is<00:06:29.339> really

00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 
them heavy thing yet which is really

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:33.230 
them heavy thing yet which is really
actually<00:06:30.029> very<00:06:30.569> low<00:06:31.469> alike<00:06:31.740> if<00:06:32.669> you<00:06:32.789> can<00:06:32.969> all

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 
actually very low alike if you can all

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.689 
actually very low alike if you can all
things<00:06:33.300> considered<00:06:34.050> now<00:06:34.699> lomography

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:35.699 
things considered now lomography

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:37.339 
things considered now lomography
obviously<00:06:36.180> didn't<00:06:36.509> really<00:06:36.809> see<00:06:37.050> a<00:06:37.080> whole<00:06:37.319> lot

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:37.349 
obviously didn't really see a whole lot

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:39.109 
obviously didn't really see a whole lot
of<00:06:37.469> future<00:06:37.769> in<00:06:37.860> the<00:06:37.919> 127<00:06:38.519> formats<00:06:38.849> so<00:06:38.969> that's

00:06:39.109 --> 00:06:39.119 
of future in the 127 formats so that's

00:06:39.119 --> 00:06:40.399 
of future in the 127 formats so that's
why<00:06:39.240> they<00:06:39.330> changed<00:06:39.479> both<00:06:39.659> these<00:06:39.869> cameras<00:06:40.289> to

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:40.409 
why they changed both these cameras to

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:43.670 
why they changed both these cameras to
35<00:06:40.800> millimeter<00:06:41.659> which<00:06:42.659> work<00:06:42.869> that<00:06:43.019> well<00:06:43.229> to

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 
35 millimeter which work that well to

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.309 
35 millimeter which work that well to
their<00:06:43.830> advantage<00:06:44.689> for<00:06:45.689> the<00:06:45.779> candor<00:06:46.199> though

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:46.319 
their advantage for the candor though

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:47.570 
their advantage for the candor though
they're<00:06:46.529> actually<00:06:46.860> quite<00:06:47.069> a<00:06:47.159> few<00:06:47.339> different

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.580 
they're actually quite a few different

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:48.949 
they're actually quite a few different
types<00:06:47.729> of<00:06:47.879> this<00:06:48.029> actually<00:06:48.419> much<00:06:48.779> like<00:06:48.930> the

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:48.959 
types of this actually much like the

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:51.379 
types of this actually much like the
Falcon<00:06:49.349> miniature<00:06:49.800> and<00:06:50.610> these<00:06:50.819> different

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:51.389 
Falcon miniature and these different

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:52.790 
Falcon miniature and these different
changes<00:06:51.689> are<00:06:51.899> really<00:06:52.169> nothing<00:06:52.499> more<00:06:52.529> than

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 
changes are really nothing more than

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.139 
changes are really nothing more than
cosmetics<00:06:53.339> they<00:06:53.459> all<00:06:53.580> have<00:06:53.759> a<00:06:53.789> little<00:06:53.999> bit

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:54.149 
cosmetics they all have a little bit

00:06:54.149 --> 00:06:55.189 
cosmetics they all have a little bit
different<00:06:54.389> look<00:06:54.449> to<00:06:54.509> them<00:06:54.689> this<00:06:55.050> one

00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 
different look to them this one

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:58.699 
different look to them this one
obviously<00:06:55.409> isn't<00:06:55.949> the<00:06:56.279> most<00:06:56.490> like<00:06:57.479> the<00:06:58.259> law

00:06:58.699 --> 00:06:58.709 
obviously isn't the most like the law

00:06:58.709 --> 00:07:00.920 
obviously isn't the most like the law
Sardinia<00:06:59.180> there<00:07:00.180> are<00:07:00.240> ones<00:07:00.419> that<00:07:00.509> are<00:07:00.689> more

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:00.930 
Sardinia there are ones that are more

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.689 
Sardinia there are ones that are more
shaped<00:07:01.649> like<00:07:01.860> a<00:07:01.889> fish<00:07:02.099> can<00:07:02.279> this<00:07:02.430> one<00:07:02.550> has<00:07:02.669> a

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:02.699 
shaped like a fish can this one has a

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:04.549 
shaped like a fish can this one has a
little<00:07:02.969> slopes<00:07:03.509> on<00:07:03.719> it<00:07:03.869> but<00:07:04.139> it's<00:07:04.169> got<00:07:04.439> the

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:04.559 
little slopes on it but it's got the

00:07:04.559 --> 00:07:07.219 
little slopes on it but it's got the
overall<00:07:05.180> oval<00:07:06.180> shape<00:07:06.539> to<00:07:06.689> it<00:07:06.719> especially<00:07:06.899> if

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:07.229 
overall oval shape to it especially if

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:09.439 
overall oval shape to it especially if
you<00:07:07.289> look<00:07:07.439> at<00:07:07.529> it<00:07:07.559> from<00:07:07.649> the<00:07:07.860> back<00:07:08.009> and<00:07:08.699> then

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:09.449 
you look at it from the back and then

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:12.350 
you look at it from the back and then
with<00:07:09.749> the<00:07:10.639> document<00:07:11.639> miniature<00:07:11.939> there's<00:07:12.149> one

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:12.360 
with the document miniature there's one

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.340 
with the document miniature there's one
with<00:07:12.509> some<00:07:12.740> more<00:07:13.740> rounded<00:07:14.669> edges

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:15.350 
with some more rounded edges

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:16.660 
with some more rounded edges
which<00:07:15.410> is<00:07:15.530> a<00:07:15.560> lot<00:07:15.650> more<00:07:15.950> like<00:07:16.130> the<00:07:16.250> sprocket

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:16.670 
which is a lot more like the sprocket

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:18.550 
which is a lot more like the sprocket
rocket<00:07:16.700> so<00:07:17.690> unfortunately<00:07:17.930> there<00:07:18.350> really

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:18.560 
rocket so unfortunately there really

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.780 
rocket so unfortunately there really
isn't<00:07:18.830> a<00:07:18.860> whole<00:07:18.890> lot<00:07:19.010> to<00:07:19.250> talk<00:07:19.430> about<00:07:19.490> with

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:19.790 
isn't a whole lot to talk about with

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.970 
isn't a whole lot to talk about with
