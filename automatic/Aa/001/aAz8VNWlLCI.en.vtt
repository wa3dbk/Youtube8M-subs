00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
besides gotta figure it this way if we

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.520 
besides gotta figure it this way if we
eat<00:04:11.820> some<00:04:12.150> mcdonalds<00:04:12.750> and<00:04:12.840> then<00:04:13.079> we<00:04:13.200> still

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
eat some mcdonalds and then we still

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.039 
eat some mcdonalds and then we still
lose<00:04:13.769> weight<00:04:13.829> then<00:04:14.820> it's<00:04:15.180> basically<00:04:15.570> like<00:04:15.870> the

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
lose weight then it's basically like the

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.409 
lose weight then it's basically like the
opposite<00:04:16.470> of<00:04:16.560> Super<00:04:16.859> Size<00:04:17.039> Me<00:04:17.070> so<00:04:17.970> think<00:04:18.269> of<00:04:18.299> it

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
opposite of Super Size Me so think of it

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.240 
opposite of Super Size Me so think of it
that<00:04:18.450> way<00:04:18.630> the<00:04:19.470> opposite<00:04:19.769> of<00:04:19.799> super<00:04:20.070> sizing

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
that way the opposite of super sizing

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.090 
that way the opposite of super sizing
see<00:04:20.669> you<00:04:20.729> guys<00:04:20.880> later
