00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
just bumping around man coverage he

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.350 
just bumping around man coverage he
gives<00:02:08.100> up<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.429> inside<00:02:08.790> because<00:02:08.940> he<00:02:09.149> thinks

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
gives up the inside because he thinks

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.630
