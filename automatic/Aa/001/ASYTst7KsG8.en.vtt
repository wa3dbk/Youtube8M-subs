00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.580
 Let's talk about what training is 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:20.320
 invisible is also worth the training 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.020
 invisible that is part of 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.380
 is an important part of what you have 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.689
 that be all the planning of our 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.689
 our business is worth I always 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:34.660
 I say it's more complicated is more 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.309
 complicated to try to manage a 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.470
 training for a popular athlete 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.199
 that for a professional athlete 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.489
 the professional athlete has 24 hours 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:48.089
 to train that gets up breakfast 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.320
 train rest rest again 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.269
 rest and have no other concern 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.120
 more than your life is that you do not train 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:56.890
 train train however you 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.329
 most of you have to 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.090
 attend to the family attend work 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.580
 find time to train 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.310
 and discuss with the woman or with the man 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.100
 because he will not let me if he leaves me etc is 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.860
 say a number of factors meet 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.420
 for the popular athlete that makes 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.880
 be a true miracle in the end 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.260
 prepare yourself this kind of thing not 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.050
 get up at 6 in the morning to go 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.630
 to train before going to work 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.490
 I have a gap at noon and then I 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.860
 I carry the lunch box I take the lunch box 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.800
 to work as there as I can because 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.350
 I leave at 2 from 2 to 3 at four 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.330
 work good this kind of thing this 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.780
 kind of things that really makes the 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.119
 end of a lot of weeks 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.350
 if this does not get along well if this does not 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.450
 carries well and is not articulated 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.430
 correctly the organism can not 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.860
 tolerate nor can you hold this kind of 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.930
 charges is worth it because the burden of 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.330
 Workload training does not 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.479
 only in your case is the 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.810
 exercise but everything else everything 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.570
 others also add sum to your fatigue 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.390
 and your fatigue so what 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.770
 you have to do is try to adapt the 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.250
 training to your situation 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.989
 personal and not the other way around and not the other way around 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.690
 many times I see plans of 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:18.080
 training that people follow plans 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.940
 of training to rajatabla to rajatabla a 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.430
 without taking into account that plan 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.440
 training who is that person ni 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.640
 what is technical or what effect is 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.680
 causing that training on that 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.150
 person and if you really have time 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.430
 does not have time to make that plan 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.660
 training but people insist on 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.410
 make training plan because 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.600
 yes, you are all left-handers, today we are going 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.620
 the ones that have to be done the most for an hour and 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.980
 half you have to do an hour and a half 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.570
 although although we are going it be it is not it 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.290
 however, it must be done then, of course 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.060
 that 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.500
 double-edged because in the end you're 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.959
 bent on wanting to fulfill a plan of 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.909
 work and you are not aware of the 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.769
 signs that your body is sending you and 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:56.930
 is telling you how you are or how you leave 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.730
 to be 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.159
 so when we talk about 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:05.659
 invisible training we have to 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:08.599
 talk about two situations one what is 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:11.970
 the real charge and another what is the charge 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:14.180
 scheduled training I explain 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.740
 when I train 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.850
 OK 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.850
 when I train 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.000
 after that training 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.960
 It is true that in our body the 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.980
 recovery adaptation and improvement or 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.580
 do not 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.950
 or not therefore after a session 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.560
 of training I have to put here 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.300
 another training session is worth 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.440
 after this I here I have to put 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.440
 another training session 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.970
 between here and here between a session another 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.220
 session and another session comes all this 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.170
 area here are the periods 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.770
 recovery but adaptation that is 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.740
 equal or more important than the own 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.590
 workload 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:04.010
 if this is not balanced 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.220
 I'm training badly 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.470
 if I 'm not able to know how my 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.060
 organism has adapted in this period 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.660
 to know what I have to do to date 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.860
 following 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:18.579
 if I do not know 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:20.680
 I am training I am wrong according 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.050
 training poorly 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:27.420
 what do I mean by this that a lot 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:29.820
 Be careful that you are very careful with 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.070
 with wanting to train train training 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.800
 train to train and not to be outstanding 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.170
 of the symptoms and the signs that I 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.230
 mark my body very much care with 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:43.500
 all of that I have to be listening to him and 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:46.430
 I have to know that sometimes the 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.860
 better training is a good rest 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.610
 and nothing happens if I rest what happens if 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.340
 break 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.340
 nothing happens 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.830
 what happens I go crazy no but if I have 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.960
 If you do not train to rest and catch me 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.120
 in the seven evils did not come out train today 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.060
 look, you're going to lose everything I 've 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.710
 done these 15 days I do not know what 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:13.530
 do not worry about it and train is 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:15.120
 exercise and recovery and the two 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.040
 are part of the burden of 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.190
 training and then there is the charge 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:23.010
 scheduled that is today an hour and a half and 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.450
 the actual charge that the actual charge is that 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:27.120
 has caused that hour and a half in my 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.320
 organism if I know 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.660
 I can put the training on the day 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.020
 following 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:35.910
 I explain myself but if I value and average 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:39.030
 I'm getting into eight-thousand series 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:41.670
 anaerobic capacity is worth and results 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.900
 that the next day he puts me the plan 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.970
 training that I have to do a 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.120
 filming of I do not know what with series of I do not know 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.800
 how many and I mind 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.220
 we are crazy what is to say 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.860
 tranquility the training has 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.449
 a lot of common sense is worth slowly 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.680
 we must apply a lot of common sense and 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:59.810
 that what you have to be able to 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.060
 agree to listen to your 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:05.230
 body 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:08.530
 know to know that for more training not 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:10.540
 I improve that that is a subject that sometimes is 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.550
 a little 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:16.689
 a little shocking to many people 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:18.549
 because we are in a spiral 

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:21.369
 a spiral where I want to do many 

00:06:18.549 --> 00:06:23.169
 things in a very short space of time and the 

00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:24.849
 training is not like that to the organism myself 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:27.219
 I can not cheat in that way 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:28.539
 organism needs some natural patterns 

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:30.429
 It is very wise 

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:32.079
 I can not rush the levels of 

00:06:30.429 --> 00:06:32.679
 performance in my body because it usually 

00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:34.509
 I'm wrong 

00:06:32.679 --> 00:06:36.399
 the organism does not work like other 

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:39.069
 things in life I have to give you the 

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:41.889
 guidelines and above all else each 

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:44.380
 each one of you has an answer 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:46.570
 totally different 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.640
 and a totally different answer and 

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:51.400
 that you have to be very clear not 

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:53.680
 we can go out and see, I see 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.120
 group trainings constantly and 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.230
 people go out in a group and rely on the 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.380
 group and that seems to me to be a 

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:00.850
 wonder because it generates there a 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:03.250
 environment a really really environment 

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:05.680
 nice and everyone we like but 

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:07.030
 group training is not always 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.120
 good for everyone who is in that 

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:12.640
 group because the answer of each one is 

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:14.500
 totally different and sometimes we 

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.910
 We insist on wanting to go on Saturdays with 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:19.180
 the group and give me a beating because 

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:21.820
 final go with the group ends up being what 

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.350
 what it ends up being here does not want 

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.390
 nobody stays behind and nobody here wants 

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:27.160
 that color me in the face but then they're 

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:30.220
 by facebook all week 

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:32.620
 crushing less then clear all that 

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:34.960
 does all that makes that we inadvertently go 

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:37.330
 generating here some dynamics 

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.730
 dynamics of training and training and 

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:42.190
 train and train and strong and strong and 

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:43.930
 strong and strong and in the end it turns out that 

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:45.790
 you say good as it can be that with 

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:47.470
 that I am crushing with what I am 

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:49.540
 training and with everything I'm 

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:51.129
 sacrificing at the end my level of 

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:53.619
 performance does not become what 

00:07:51.129 --> 00:07:56.050
 I really hope it is not and it's because 

00:07:53.619 --> 00:07:59.080
 I'm convinced that we trained 

00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:01.479
 much more much more than we should 

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:03.090
 training is worth much more than 

00:08:01.479 --> 00:08:05.190
 you wanted to train us 

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:08.060
 yes 

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:08.060
 two
