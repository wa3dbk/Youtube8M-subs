00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:06.649 
amps on the 12 volt rails but after

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:09.039 
amps on the 12 volt rails but after
experimenting<00:01:07.219> to<00:01:07.520> see<00:01:07.549> how<00:01:08.210> much<00:01:08.509> I<00:01:08.810> can

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
experimenting to see how much I can

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.080 
experimenting to see how much I can
actually<00:01:09.289> pull<00:01:09.740> out<00:01:09.770> of<00:01:09.950> it<00:01:10.130> it<00:01:10.609> quits<00:01:10.909> after

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
actually pull out of it it quits after

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.410 
actually pull out of it it quits after
14<00:01:11.719> amps<00:01:12.109> so<00:01:12.639> setting<00:01:13.639> the<00:01:13.670> power<00:01:13.939> left<00:01:14.179> to

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
14 amps so setting the power left to

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.349 
14 amps so setting the power left to
limit<00:01:14.600> its<00:01:14.899> draw<00:01:15.200> to<00:01:15.469> 13<00:01:15.889> amps<00:01:16.249> at<00:01:16.369> 12<00:01:16.399> volts<00:01:16.969> it

00:01:17.349 --> 00:01:17.359 
limit its draw to 13 amps at 12 volts it

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:20.440 
limit its draw to 13 amps at 12 volts it
gives<00:01:17.630> me<00:01:17.780> 34<00:01:18.319> amps<00:01:18.770> at<00:01:18.950> 4<00:01:19.280> volt<00:01:19.520> of<00:01:19.789> charge<00:01:20.149> so

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
gives me 34 amps at 4 volt of charge so

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.309 
gives me 34 amps at 4 volt of charge so
at<00:01:21.439> 34<00:01:21.859> amps<00:01:22.249> per<00:01:22.459> hour<00:01:22.670> I<00:01:23.030> should<00:01:23.929> be<00:01:24.079> able<00:01:24.200> to

00:01:24.309 --> 00:01:24.319 
at 34 amps per hour I should be able to

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:26.559 
at 34 amps per hour I should be able to
charge<00:01:24.590> this<00:01:24.889> module<00:01:25.280> completely<00:01:25.850> in<00:01:26.060> eight

00:01:26.559 --> 00:01:26.569 
charge this module completely in eight

charge this module completely in eight
point<00:01:26.840> eight<00:01:27.079> hours<00:01:27.499> of<00:01:28.340> course<00:01:28.759> I<00:01:29.090> only<00:01:29.420> have

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
point eight hours of course I only have

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.959 
point eight hours of course I only have
a<00:01:29.689> few<00:01:29.990> hours<00:01:30.049> to<00:01:30.289> work<00:01:30.529> on<00:01:30.740> this<00:01:30.920> TV<00:01:31.189> so<00:01:31.819> I<00:01:31.850> will

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:31.969 
a few hours to work on this TV so I will

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:35.019 
a few hours to work on this TV so I will
partially<00:01:32.209> charge<00:01:32.779> it<00:01:33.020> then<00:01:33.799> do<00:01:34.219> my<00:01:34.399> test<00:01:34.729> and

00:01:35.019 --> 00:01:35.029 
partially charge it then do my test and

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:39.460 
partially charge it then do my test and
finish<00:01:35.509> charging<00:01:35.959> it<00:01:36.079> later<00:01:36.319> tonight

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.800 

next<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.650> will<00:01:41.310> need<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.729> make<00:01:41.759> some<00:01:41.939> cables<00:01:42.630> to

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
next I will need to make some cables to

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.420 
next I will need to make some cables to
connect<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.259> module<00:01:43.650> to<00:01:43.680> my<00:01:43.950> existing

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
connect this module to my existing

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.450 
connect this module to my existing
system<00:01:44.970> on<00:01:45.150> the<00:01:45.330> Samba<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:46.070> want<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.159> place<00:01:47.310> the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
system on the Samba I want to place the

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.490 
system on the Samba I want to place the
module<00:01:47.850> inside<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.210> vehicle<00:01:48.899> in<00:01:49.080> the<00:01:49.320> luggage

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
module inside the vehicle in the luggage

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.800 
module inside the vehicle in the luggage
area<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.280> can<00:01:50.369> have<00:01:50.759> better<00:01:51.000> access<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.630> the

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
area so I can have better access to the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.800 
area so I can have better access to the
voltage<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.530> temperature<00:01:52.680> monitors<00:01:53.460> and

voltage and temperature monitors and

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.960 
voltage and temperature monitors and
also<00:01:54.810> in<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.200> unlikely<00:01:55.770> event<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.369> fire<00:01:56.640> I

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
also in the unlikely event of a fire I

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.570 
also in the unlikely event of a fire I
can<00:01:57.750> easily<00:01:58.020> pull<00:01:58.380> over<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.890> extinguish<00:01:59.399> the

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
can easily pull over and extinguish the

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.670 
can easily pull over and extinguish the
fire<00:01:59.850> without<00:02:00.240> even<00:02:00.539> having<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.110> get<00:02:01.350> out<00:02:01.530> of

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
fire without even having to get out of

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.859 
fire without even having to get out of
the<00:02:01.770> car<00:02:04.640> to<00:02:05.640> connect<00:02:05.939> this<00:02:06.090> module<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.720> my

the car to connect this module to my

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.290 
the car to connect this module to my
system<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.560> found<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:08.069> easiest<00:02:08.489> place<00:02:08.880> in<00:02:09.209> the

that way I didn't have to mess with
running<00:02:22.140> cables<00:02:22.560> out<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:22.920> back<00:02:23.160> of<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.459> car

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
so here are the cables coming in and I

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.259 
so here are the cables coming in and I
have<00:02:30.780> three<00:02:31.170> six<00:02:31.920> six<00:02:32.430> gauge<00:02:33.350> cables<00:02:35.269> just

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
have three six six gauge cables just

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:37.670 
have three six six gauge cables just
because<00:02:36.480> they're<00:02:36.630> easier<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:36.930> handle<00:02:37.380> I<00:02:37.440> think

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
because they're easier to handle I think

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.559 
because they're easier to handle I think
that's<00:02:37.799> how<00:02:37.890> I'm<00:02:38.010> gonna<00:02:38.130> do<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.580> final<00:02:38.970> you

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
know pack on these cells these modules

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:52.539 
know pack on these cells these modules
or<00:02:43.200> whatever<00:02:43.470> here's<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.430> negative<00:02:44.850> side<00:02:51.290> and
