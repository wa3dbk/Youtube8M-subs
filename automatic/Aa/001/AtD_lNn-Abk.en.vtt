00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.460
 Fame and recognition could bring

 dictatorships Bulgarians were able to 110 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.640
 percent however now they decided to stop by 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.859
 on a completely different territory not heavenly 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.230
 island but gangster with kira times dry 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.620
 law in america proposal from which 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.120
 simply impossible to refuse 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.890
 We present to your attention a video review

 playground.ru 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.510
 it all starts like it usually and 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.550
 started a simple penniless guy 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.129
 pocket dwells in america where is it 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.989
 attach the case to create his personality 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.899
 they give us their own giving 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.850
 possibility of choice 1 6 physiognomy and how 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.650
 it was in tropicana to build base 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.409
 characteristics using composing 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.180
 hero biographies 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.340
 ahead of the way from private to small 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.180
 gang da capo di tutti capi 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.830
 the mass of all bosses personal growth is shorter 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.930
 for greater drama scenario 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.970
 involves fighting a sibling 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.610
 which is on the other side of the invisible 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.710
 barricades of the law is pathetically threatened and 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.100
 requires stop all ugliness but 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.040
 it is not interesting omerta from that series of games 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:36.000
 where it is not interesting why but I wonder how 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:40.590
 and what naturally money is power like 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.100
 by all available means economy 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.240
 strategic part the best part of the game 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.649
 we rent not occupied premises and 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.020
 organize a hangout on the spot 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.020
 smugglers or brewery or 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.119
 We start to drive that stronger to the goods 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.520
 not kopilsya warehouses which by the way is not 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.680
 rubber open underground bars 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.659
 and if they do not have time to cope with 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.610
 the influx of goods begin to supply 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.070
 competitors who then can and 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.899
 buy back or throw off the excess 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.780
 friendly to other groups from neighboring 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.910
 districts to the word they can and buy 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.060
 any of the three resources and its alcohol and 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.980
 weapons here on the card single transactions 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.770
 sometimes you can give to the paw assistant 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.720
 the sheriff to slow down the passions 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.940
 so called indicator 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.099
 Police who interest you 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.400
 growing depending on your activity in 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.870
 the area has aktivnichat besides 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.489
 development of its infrastructure 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.769
 We look at the independent 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.880
 Illegal business guessing let 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:40.130
 live or will be more profitable to protect 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.510
 or may be organize a raid and 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.180
 yourself start refueling on 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.950
 the vacated territory would be nice 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.080
 attend to issues of authority and 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.020
 pleasant population it raises 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.000
 efficiency of dirty business and in general 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.670
 it's time to we are part of the money and take up 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.200
 legal matter but also build on it for 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.380
 part of the economy and not always possible 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.000
 put criminal money into circulation 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.550
 for example the purchase of building land 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.100
 some types of bribes only for clean 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.260
 legal money spin don spin 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.150
 let his subordinates run around concluding 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.390
 transactions accompanying the goods under the cube 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.850
 informers everything is so cool that 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.520
 when you begin to understand how much 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.380
 everyone wore casual and that serious 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.630
 global control level you get out 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.030
 will not let that upset the country 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.340
 each area is explored 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.650
 quickly and only it seems you have settled the matter 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.590
 money is flowing river and then level 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.610
 ends start next starting 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.830
 business again 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.320
 not pleased also small number 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.770
 subordinates on the one hand choose there 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.230
 from whom 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.090
 won how many of them only here for some reason 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.150
 can work actively no more 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.920
 six it's counting boss okay while we 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.020
 only busy with the economy 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.810
 Spartan respecting overs is not very 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.970
 interferes of course sent assignment fighter 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.160
 can't do anything else but 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.920
 rarely when doing so is required 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.320
 task quantities problems begin 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.300
 in tactical battles you first 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.880
 happily whipped in X-com 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.100
 but just a little bit sorted out 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.320
 of course a parallel from the illustrious series 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:15.230
 obvious yes just quality here 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.660
 implementation is not at all very fast 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.850
 the camera starts to annoy uncomfortable and 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.370
 not able to often turn under the right 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.710
 angle then questions arise to the system 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.900
 internal costing regardless 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.350
 from what chance of defeat they will indicate 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.150
 miss fighter can always 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.890
 shelter system is also clearly not finalized 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.530
 for example from this side of the sofa 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:39.590
 racks or whatever you can hide with 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:42.320
 the other is not and you ask pretty quickly 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.870
 question why the mission can take 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.630
 only four opponents often 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:50.000
 a dozen and more and more often enemies are not 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.980
 worse and even better than your fighters 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.470
 from the middle of the game battles turn into 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.630
 tedious and complicated outcome 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.120
 which depends only on how often 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:03.150
 will miss the cop by your 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.130
 guys are good that some task 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.600
 you can skip giving the computer 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.970
 decide the outcome of the disassembly 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.430
 otherwise it is very easy to throw about myrtle on 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.190
 halfway unintentionally removing it in a fit 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.130
 omerta city of irritability 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.330
 gangsters turned out very, very 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.640
 ambiguous it certainly 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.350
 exciting and dynamic game when 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.750
 it comes to the strategic part 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.700
 thoughtful economic model does not give 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.400
 get bored and lets these beat those 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:32.480
 by which you most likable but 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:35.190
 whether there is a fly in the ointment its visuality 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.140
 locality feel like a boss not 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.600
 everything will turn out too small 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:42.240
 and tactical battles that could be 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.070
 a kind of highlight on this 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.770
 moment while are nail in the coffin 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.630
 but the developers strenuously patch from the game 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.940
 trying to fix your own misses 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:53.310
 so probably the situation is not soon 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.700
 is a deplorable and yet 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:58.860
 the creation of the Bulgarians is just not bad but 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:02.490
 crooked game she is able to entertain but 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:05.300
 good luck and see you on 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.300
