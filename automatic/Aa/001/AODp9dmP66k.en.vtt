00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.970
 and now I will continue with the installation 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.809
 Heatsink 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:11.260
 is the not acting nh of 14 s of 2011 for 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:16.430
 this soccer that the ejea 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:18.980
 2011 the first is to use these 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.830
 sounds that look like doubles that 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.220
 four come included in the in the 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:29.829
 package of clothes and we are going to screw them 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.829
 here in the corners of the socket 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.750
 there you simply have to leave 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:38.420
 tight do not have to do as much force 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.950
 I'm going to do with my hand 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:46.300
 we put each of the 4 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.610
 and there will be sustained the two brackets 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.200
 that finally are the ones that are going to 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.610
 hold the 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.000
 the heatsink as such 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.000
 yes 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.530
 we already have the four if we wanted 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:04.150
 we could with a small tool 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.409
 tighten a bit but not so 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.180
 necessary 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:12.410
 simply that it is not 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:15.980
 there loose ok here you have to choose the 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:21.110
 orientation, look at the diagram here 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:24.920
 that has a current there are two ways to 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.020
 of orienting the heatsink one way is 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.720
 that the air is circulating from this 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.480
 shape 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.960
 let's say from left to right and the other 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.720
 way it is up 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.340
 for the 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.120
 and height of the memories that I am 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.140
 using 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:46.150
 I need this to stay with the 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.600
 fans 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:52.990
 in a lateral orientation then in 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:57.590
 this case we are going to locate these 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:02:01.250
 pieces that are nm and mv 2 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:04.009
 up and down without up and down the 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.219
 another option is to locate it so that 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:09.110
 would be for example the air that coming out 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:11.300
 outwards in the case of others 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.110
 platforms but I'm going to use it 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:18.019
 up and down you have to make sure 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.860
 that this is given out is this 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:25.250
 curvature is facing outwards and with these 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:29.379
 nut bolt nut 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.379
 let's fix the there 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:36.610
 and here we are going to require a little more 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:41.130
 strength we will use 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:46.440
 but you have to use the tool that 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.760
 includes in acting to tighten those those 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.530
 screws that basically a 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:56.360
 screwdriver but with a l 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.360
 let's tighten these 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.510
 and there 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.610
 it is more or less 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.340
 the assembly of this we use this 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.970
 tool that was the one that included a 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.610
 act that is a screwdriver nothing more 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.370
 that this and we tighten these threads 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.920
 who see here 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.400
 van aa 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.170
 here to enter this part of the 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.600
 heatsink 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.660
 which it is the one with the 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.060
 let's say the pressure thanks to that to that 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.030
 spring they see there and is the one 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:39.470
 finally we are going to press to be able to 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:42.310
 leave the heatsink fixed 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:46.170
 to the processor and on the motherboard 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.170
 let's apply the thermal paste 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.490
 we apply here 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.610
 only a little 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:03.060
 and to install the heatsink we must 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.230
 remove the fans and the 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.860
 plastic protection that has here 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.860
 obviously 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:16.260
 and now if we can proceed to install it 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:20.030
 we must locate that this enters in 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.030
 these threads you have here 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.520
 that we had previously installed 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.930
 install the memory first because if you 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.260
 active in this memory is going to stay there 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.260
 under 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.300
 of the heatsink 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.180
 the one that located 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.500
 the first 1 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.790
 now she makes sense in the 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.790
 tool 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:55.920
 a little bit and we go to the next side 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:04.800
 when this is finished, it will not give more 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:07.080
 we know that it turned out well 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.590
 tight 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:15.930
 is going to do a bound as pressure a 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:19.080
 a little bit older and there was this 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:22.680
 and we proceed to install again the 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:25.070
 the sink fans 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.070
 fans 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:31.050
 you have to look for these arrows 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.750
 girls that see here 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:37.409
 these arrows indicate the flow of 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:40.229
 air and to where we want to take 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:42.620
 the air me for example this I'm going to 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:45.490
 put like this 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:49.010
 so that the air flows towards this part 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:52.060
 and can leave through here in the 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:54.010
 box and by the top 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.919
 and these fans are pretty 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:59.610
 easy to handle because they have these 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:59.610
 hooks 

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:04.879
 we indicate the cable 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:14.280
 we locate here and with these hooks 

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:18.560
 we just pull in other places 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:21.110
 and already there was the 14-millimeter 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.710
 installed 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:26.560
 the other fan 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:28.120
 it can be put on this side with this 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.479
 other side 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.070
 we also remember to leave this to 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:35.160
 down to be connected to the 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:39.190
 death 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:42.930
 and we use the hooks 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:44.770
 that come with the fan 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:47.370
 here 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:47.370
 I stay 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.250
 and ready 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:01.639
 and there it was installed and they remained 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:03.580
 installed the two fans 

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:09.280
 how is it 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:11.439
 of noctua nh of 14 on fashion for 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.330
 installation of the fans 

00:07:11.439 --> 00:07:15.129
 already on the motherboard here I have the 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:18.500
 connectors of the fans I'm going to 

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:21.050
 use the aie that includes the water 

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:23.350
 and good on the black side connector the 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.350
 fans 

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:30.709
 and with the other side 

00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:33.999
 I will install the cream color in the 

00:07:30.709 --> 00:07:36.559
 part where I did cpu for nuno so that 

00:07:33.999 --> 00:07:40.489
 handle the same revolutions and give 

00:07:36.559 --> 00:07:44.500
 the same energy to both fans 

00:07:40.489 --> 00:07:47.600
 we organize it in such a way that he 

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:50.180
 that will not interfere with anything out there 

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:54.130
 and with this we can proceed to 

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:54.130
 install the motherboard in the game
