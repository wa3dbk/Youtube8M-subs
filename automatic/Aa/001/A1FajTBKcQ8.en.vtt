00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
right here so you want to make sure that

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.840 
right here so you want to make sure that
you<00:01:48.540> don't<00:01:48.720> burn<00:01:48.930> yourself<00:01:49.439> so<00:01:50.220> as<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.729> can

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
you don't burn yourself so as you can

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.240 
you don't burn yourself so as you can
see<00:01:50.909> it's<00:01:51.299> still<00:01:51.570> burning<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:52.049> little<00:01:52.200> bit<00:01:52.530> but

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
see it's still burning a little bit but

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.359

once<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:54.180> stops<00:01:54.600> flaming<00:01:55.259> then<00:01:55.829> go<00:01:56.040> ahead<00:01:56.159> and

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
once it stops flaming then go ahead and

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.789 
once it stops flaming then go ahead and
take<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.670> spoon<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.390> just<00:01:57.479> go<00:01:58.259> ahead<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.649> mix

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
take a spoon and just go ahead and mix

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.640 
take a spoon and just go ahead and mix
it<00:01:59.009> through<00:01:59.540> and<00:02:00.540> we<00:02:00.659> want<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:00.990> make<00:02:01.110> sure<00:02:01.140> that

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
it through and we want to make sure that

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.910 
it through and we want to make sure that
it's<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.830> nice<00:02:02.190> thick<00:02:03.000> syrup<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:04.440> this<00:02:04.680> usually

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
it's a nice thick syrup and this usually

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.130 
it's a nice thick syrup and this usually
it<00:02:05.250> takes<00:02:05.430> about<00:02:05.700> one<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.240> two<00:02:06.300> minutes<00:02:06.810> until

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
it takes about one to two minutes until

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.859 
it takes about one to two minutes until
the<00:02:07.230> flames<00:02:07.530> actually<00:02:07.860> subside<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:09.540> be

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
the flames actually subside so be

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.750 
the flames actually subside so be
careful<00:02:10.350> also<00:02:10.740> when<00:02:10.920> you're<00:02:11.070> doing<00:02:11.100> it<00:02:11.490> in

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
careful also when you're doing it in

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.340 
careful also when you're doing it in
here<00:02:12.000> an<00:02:12.120> oven<00:02:12.420> because<00:02:12.630> remember<00:02:13.080> these

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
here an oven because remember these

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.660 
here an oven because remember these
flames<00:02:13.620> are<00:02:13.740> actually<00:02:14.190> going<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.400> go<00:02:14.520> up

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
flames are actually going to go up

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.580 
flames are actually going to go up
pretty<00:02:14.910> high<00:02:15.180> so<00:02:15.930> you<00:02:15.990> want<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.410> make<00:02:16.560> sure

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
pretty high so you want to make sure

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.620 
pretty high so you want to make sure
that<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:17.070> don't<00:02:17.190> burn<00:02:17.460> anything<00:02:17.790> around<00:02:18.180> it<00:02:18.420> a

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
that you don't burn anything around it a

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.540 
that you don't burn anything around it a
lot<00:02:19.050> of<00:02:19.200> times<00:02:19.410> you<00:02:19.590> might<00:02:19.740> also<00:02:19.980> want<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.400> just

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
lot of times you might also want to just

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.850 
lot of times you might also want to just
take<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:20.970> away<00:02:21.060> from<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.570> stove<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:22.140> then<00:02:22.710> go

take it away from the stove and then go

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.280 
take it away from the stove and then go
ahead<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.190> light<00:02:23.550> it<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:23.940> as<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:24.840> can<00:02:25.110> see

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
ahead and light it and as you can see

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.950 
ahead and light it and as you can see
right<00:02:25.500> now<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.770> flames<00:02:26.190> have<00:02:26.460> subsided<00:02:26.960> so

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.340 
cook down until it's got a nice syrupy
texture<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.610> this<00:02:42.209> is<00:02:42.390> how<00:02:42.600> we<00:02:42.660> make<00:02:43.320> the

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
texture and this is how we make the

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.800 
texture and this is how we make the
final<00:02:43.800> step<00:02:44.250> in<00:02:44.490> preparing<00:02:45.060> our<00:02:45.480> sauce<00:02:45.780> for

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
final step in preparing our sauce for

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.280 
final step in preparing our sauce for
making<00:02:46.590> Bananas<00:02:47.040> Foster
