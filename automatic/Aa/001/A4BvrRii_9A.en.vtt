00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:04.889
 Mr President, that stretch 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.309
 Dear German and German you two lie 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.979
 056 is behind us and 

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:14.829
 it had a perceived length of a passage 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:17.829
 ten years 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:25.800
 and it was that long 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.369
 we had a rough one year 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.189
 seco 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.090
 tradition 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.800
 and a spirited chancellor too 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.800
 she did not show it 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.670
 but not only the spirit was present 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.500
 2007 6 was also often easy I also vegetables 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.650
 there was in front of the church and scandal 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.650
 the problem is forgotten now 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.650
 Near 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.400
 but also happen to people yesterday 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.690
 that we just 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.520
 henceforth 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.720
 tough Welper Ralf Rother and the student join forces at the schools 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.020
 shootings 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.500
 and we feel who still wants to be interested 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.500
 he will probably not have to apply for a gun license in the future 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.680
 but the youth is only 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.510
 a lot of ingredients 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.710
 we do philosopher Johann Lafer says 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.720
 8th 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.090
 d 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.860
 if you add flour and water and one in the wrong order 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.810
 then the mass becomes soggy and does not open 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.980
 That's why it needs, for example, a German requirement in Germany 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.770
 who speaks German he must be able to do it 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.860
 For example, Finland does not have a language long ago 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.870
 but not for Germany and the finish 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.420
 after that they will not make any sense for us 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.839
 That should make us think 

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:15.389
 where we do not speak German because 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:18.389
 got through at Wigan's CD im 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:23.249
 the world came to us and I could 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:25.959
 how many people him this Germany 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.359
 the new ones fit 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:31.819
 we've got it liberal and cosmopolitan show 

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:35.609
 even when Iran invited a few presidents 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.269
 who denies the Holocaust and wants to destroy Israel 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.729
 we do not deny it 

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:45.729
 that we wait for ourselves 60 years ago 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.599
 You have to give Iran a learning process 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:53.739
 the Iranian president is here 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.509
 active Galactic German history 

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:59.859
 And maybe someday that will be 70 years maybe once 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:03.349
 afterwards there was a pretty holocaust memorial Garrett 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.449
 for many it is important 

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:10.449
 for that point to the page of Liev show 

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:15.179
 which we even delivered weapons but 

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:18.179
 we also gave weapons when the Arab side 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:22.419
 more precisely, because of this, animals prefer predestined 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.909
 to resolve the conflict in the Middle East 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:27.739
 we know 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.019
 the weapon systems at that should 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.019
 Ben 

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:43.589
 Our government has now asked me to say 

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:48.259
 that we have a government that does a good job 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.289
 and yet the dissatisfaction of the citizens is getting stronger 

00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:58.249
 we have to call on the crew Lazio 

00:03:59.149 --> 00:04:02.149
 we get a higher VAT in the year 

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:06.109
 but we do not have one for that 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:09.109
 with death penalty and no torture » 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:14.519
 not the worldly things the peace 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.579
 the pope's visit showed 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.579
 that young people are taking more of Pronto 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.400
 you still expect the change 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.400
 but they feel the pope is something really great 

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:33.559
 if he speaks then the Titans is made of steel and 

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:37.279
 what wonderful views there were centuries ago 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:40.979
 OM 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.520
 that gives me every legitimate hope 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.539
 each compatriot now has another four million 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:57.740
 are unemployed 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.740
 and only ten million are also threatening uses 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:04.939
 At 80 million Germans they only attract a minority 

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:07.520
 they are happy 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.520
 that is not all as bad as them 

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:14.839
 like the philosopher Jens Weißflog St 

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:18.819
 You will have to turn your head for more before you leave Germany 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:21.819
 decays 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.730
 because the upswing is here 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.850
 it goes on there are bright spots one 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.659
 May I tell you today? 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:40.559
 I want everyone 

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:43.309
 who are not doing so well the work is like that 

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:44.839
 and without hope 

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:46.680
 now stand the road and 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.669
 on the edge of the say 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:50.770
 me and my wife 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.020
 we would have thought about it for a long time 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.539
 we saw no alternative 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:59.150
 it is natural for us 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.119
 the potentials 

00:06:02.119 --> 00:06:03.809
 on this day 

00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:06.770
 generously 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.110
 especially enjoy
