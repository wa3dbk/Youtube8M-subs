00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.120
 top skater koen verweij runs more 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.590
 then fantastic skating season 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.330
 during olympic player he grabs 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.860
 was next to the gold in fifteen 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.860
 one hundred meters becomes second 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.740
 where the team pursuit party 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.720
 together with Jan Blokhuis and Sven Kramer 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.720
 yet that coveted golden slice 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:27.700
 Oh no 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.500
 body 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.410
 I have a very nice thing to see 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.040
 political met and 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.820
 I am very happy that winning tastes 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.830
 to more 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.860
 and that is exactly the reason that you 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.360
 competes in star jumping 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.059
 I saluted the win in the pack 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.960
 I like to keep going, so we go 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.059
 just for profit 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.739
 i'm throwing someone from before 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.660
 wood and it seemed nice to have some yes 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.930
 also to rise above itself with 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.640
 some new things from the dune pan 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.160
 I'm from is such a few plugs 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.500
 nuts time in it scope our rest days 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.759
 are we have gone the limit 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.170
 of rock off is fine and rivers 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:12.330
 that actually also did before the fin 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.220
 those were also considerable jumps 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.310
 now twice as high so come on 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.310
 home 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.759
 step an experienced rotten stuff 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.850
 but the skating season is not over yet 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.350
 end 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.720
 hey while his competitors are all 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.970
 the pool in degrees focus could still be 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.030
 always skating 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.400
 oh oh focus is really on the go 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.280
 Tony for Seven is busy with your diet 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.170
 sleep with your hours and train the 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.170
 intake of the wk and occasionally the 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.340
 thought like jumping to the stars 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.680
 occasionally they played through mine 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.340
 I head that I don't know yet 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.340
 have been able to train 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.740
 think your first jump just 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.740
 will come all the way 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.250
 I've seen what he already on the 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.710
 mat can closely with gymnastics itself or 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.410
 from the ground that is and that would be 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.190
 really very impressive and then I go 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.190
 me to metea 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.240
 the hard trainer is rewarded because 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.640
 Kroes shines last weekend 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.800
 again and become world champion for some 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.390
 I really have to think about a park 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.010
 you sometimes maybe twice a day 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.020
 going to train in the pool for a while 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.660
 i hope i will pick it up soon 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.070
 and that I think I could fight it 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.360
 to go 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.250
 I had a second place at the 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.900
 olympic games at 3000 of seconds 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.770
 so i don't have them in one or two the 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.770
 play so go for the win
