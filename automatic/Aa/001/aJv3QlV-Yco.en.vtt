00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 at the end of '94, sony released 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.490
 my first sony game console 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.130
 playstation 1 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.610
 as you can guess it was the most 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:19.199
 the first model which was called from itself 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:24.420
 as much as 1000 here you can see for yourself 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:27.599
 Already 1000 this model was the most 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.330
 cool why because she had 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.189
 the most out and opportunity well 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.600
 first let's see what's here 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.360
 memory card heights 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.590
 above slots and below us ports for two 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.500
 joysticks but it happens naturally 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.320
 splitter viewer from one year 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.030
 make 4 four more half an hour 8 well not 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.460
 I can tell if there is a game for eight 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.670
 memory card looks like this sony 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.750
 Playstation narrow memory card with yourself already 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.629
 10 20 model 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:00.090
 Here it is and everything is inserted and you can already 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:04.949
 15 blocks remain on it 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:07.650
 simple power up in to open the tray 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.439
 City Roma and reset button reset 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.540
 Well, that's such a sidir in subsequent 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.119
 models there have changed a little position 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.580
 This drive was improved there 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.189
 technology advantages and cheapened it like 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.009
 the very first model is the toughest 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.140
 production cost but experience was 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.570
 little then they have therefore they did 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.390
 first such and then steel and sherit 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.140
 cheaper but in the first model the most 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.250
 outputs this food is the output for 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.710
 audio Video 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.650
 well, usually a plug like that 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.560
 dreamcast is inserted and there in tulips 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.720
 about the exit of cards only 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.570
 also s-video output which later 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.909
 removed from all other models also 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.920
 there are the usual 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:55.049
 composite video and stereo output 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.329
 they were also removed in the next one 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.969
 model has output some here and 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.750
 50 25 world feast in the course of power can and 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.760
 from where to 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.540
 not just insert the power supply here 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:08.460
 I did not try the trial I do not know and also here 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.899
 this output that connects the link 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.930
 cable two consoles important to play 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.270
 for example in doom together on 2 TVs 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.920
 to the yard consoles and here is such a slot 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.600
 expansion under which was conceived 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.390
 do a whole bunch of peripheral 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.720
 devices but from the fact that its never 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.380
 could apply for purpose afterwards 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.310
 sony him retired his own 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.860
 consoles for future models 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:36.420
 Now I will try to open the grid 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:39.980
 it's not so easy because everything is done 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.980
 quality and for the ages 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.290
 memory finally I could open it 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.690
 it is very difficult here 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.400
 catch it immediately you can see what it is 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.739
 the first model has not been finalized yet 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.270
 I thought it out here and so he looked but 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.239
 it began to be used to 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:09.150
 insert cracker codes here and break 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.850
 games like this while fret clung still here 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.440
 these slots this is not here the plus here 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.140
 this 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.820
 serves to connect here 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.560
 Video sit-ins that have this at 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.769
 fret which is inserted simultaneously 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.959
 court and court hop and then exits and you can 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:28.200
 watch video sit disks so prefix 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:31.709
 they are not drawn by default 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.560
 us along with sony playstation 1 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:38.010
 Joysticks came out the very first model 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:41.130
 Joystick was called 1010 here if you can see 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.500
 here she came out of the place immediately with this 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.019
 console in December 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:49.470
 had a very, very short posting 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:53.459
 which was only one length 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:56.640
 meter that's very funny of course 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:59.519
 It looks like a country of 5 meter wire 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.920
 play you need to imagine standing next to 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:04.650
 a well, he inserted naturally here 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.010
 such exit had contact and tried 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.069
 here it was possible to play and it was 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.090
 the very first anger and chalk well these 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.160
 here is a cage squares 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.590
 cross circle and triangle afterwards 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.620
 these characters became sony symbol 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.990
 playstation in general marge i did do 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.910
 it is also like a joystick super 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.100
 nintendo because the first did not 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.660
 drive for super nintendo and then she with 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.970
 He scolded him and decided to release his 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.630
 disk based console 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.490
 here sony how would she look what 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.260
 there was a super nintendo joystick with coaches 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.740
 I also decided to track my own tracker 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.690
 add well and improve its look also 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.060
 tired and ergonomic and still 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.100
 slightly changed it comes out in all 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.680
 their guises in all their new 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:54.040
 sony consoles releases about here 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.650
 such a joystick looks like further in 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.800
 ninety-sixth year sony decided 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:03.240
 recycle the joystick and release it 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:06.490
 an improved model this model was called 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:09.520
 1080 principle she looked like that 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.889
 first joystick but had one 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.800
 Ifrit you jade and whether there is 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:17.280
 ring to reduce interference and more 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.870
 long wire though he is practically 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.870
 I look the same some kind of joystick 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:25.690
 and then we are building 90 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.270
 sony came up with a great analog thing 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.070
 dual shock joystick 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:32.530
 there is already a mastic here which can 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:35.260
 there was a push and manage there 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:38.919
 vibration did not want smoky against 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:41.650
 which was very comfortable and in 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:43.750
 exploitation is useful i always thought that 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:47.950
 the first model is called the tab 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:49.660
 bbw she is very big but on the very 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:52.120
 In fact, it is not so big not so much 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:54.220
 heavy when I need eggs she came with 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.050
 other consoles for example compared 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.880
 sega mega drive though i have a pirate 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.590
 but in size it is the same as the original 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:03.980
 here it is like this 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:06.110
 gd if you compare it from those a dreamcast 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.300
 it looks something like this that is 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.020
 Renkas even wider but for decree a little 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.630
 heavier 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:14.540
 Well, naturally sega is easier so the site 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:16.670
 not so heavy things big then 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:19.370
 sony has released a new model removed 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:21.770
 abortions then took another 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.500
 that is, she removed in 1 firms reprint 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:27.230
 I chose these towers and what they said 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:29.510
 video cable + this power and in another 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.950
 models she removed also this port 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.690
 because it ceased to apply 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:35.750
 and still others are the latest ones 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:37.970
 the model was a little light as if 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:41.690
 some piece of chinese plastic 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:44.270
 I absolutely do not appreciate what is good first 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.970
 Model sony playstation it from itself 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:49.130
 already 1000 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:50.930
 The Japanese model is so that it is possible 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:54.620
 swap method 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:58.580
 run any completely 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:07:01.100
 games open the disc in the drive 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:06.040
 insert and run well, I now you 

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:06.040
 I 'll show it all
