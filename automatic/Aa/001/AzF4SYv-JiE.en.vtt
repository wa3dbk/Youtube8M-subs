00:00:03.349 --> 00:00:07.627
Seichi Ikemoto

00:00:07.627 --> 00:00:12.716
Tell us about the fight.

00:00:12.716 --> 00:00:23.644
Yamamoto is a strong fighter and I'm no match.

00:00:23.644 --> 00:00:29.821
He kept coming and I couldn't keep a good distance.

00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:37.875
How was the double punch?

00:00:37.875 --> 00:00:44.813
I threw it when I had him in the corner.

00:00:44.813 --> 00:00:59.357
I felt like it did some damage, but since my leg was hurting from the lowkick,

00:00:59.357 --> 00:01:13.266
I couldn't put much power into it.

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:19.470
Did you throw the "white cat"?

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:27.113
There are some parts I don't remember so I'm not sure.

00:01:27.113 --> 00:01:41.928
It's not the crab-claw one.

00:01:42.397 --> 00:01:48.577
Is the crab claw your new move?

00:01:48.577 --> 00:02:03.139
It's an attack like a kneel kick.

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:21.800
I was cautioned against a foul so I'm not sure if I can continue to use that one.

00:02:22.494 --> 00:02:32.778
Was a striking match difficult?

00:02:32.778 --> 00:02:47.065
It was my first one and since my opponent kept coming forward

00:02:47.065 --> 00:03:11.611
I couldn't use any tricky techniques that require distance.

00:03:12.082 --> 00:03:16.711
Your future goal?

00:03:16.711 --> 00:03:30.936
I had a great time so I'd like to work my way up and try a striking match again.
