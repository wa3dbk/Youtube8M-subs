00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.799 

we'll<00:00:52.140> put<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.829> back<00:00:53.100> in<00:00:53.340> there<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.760> see<00:00:54.719> if

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
we'll put that back in there and see if

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.450 
we'll put that back in there and see if
I<00:00:54.870> can't<00:00:55.079> do<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.260> better<00:00:55.440> job<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.829> shipping<00:00:56.340> it

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
I can't do a better job of shipping it

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.430 
I can't do a better job of shipping it
now<00:00:56.670> see<00:00:57.090> if<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.210> works<00:00:59.000> and<00:01:00.000> then<00:01:00.329> once<00:01:01.289> we

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
now see if that works and then once we

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.479 
now see if that works and then once we
get<00:01:01.530> this<00:01:01.710> thing<00:01:01.770> running

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
get this thing running

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.230

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
wiring I got wires scattered everywhere

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
wiring I got wires scattered everywhere
wiring<00:01:18.060> diagram<00:01:18.630> just<00:01:18.869> printed<00:01:19.290> up<00:01:19.850> and<00:01:21.080> we'll

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
wiring diagram just printed up and we'll

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.649 
wiring diagram just printed up and we'll
do<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.229> little<00:01:22.500> wire<00:01:23.299> now<00:01:24.299> what<00:01:24.450> were<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.600> just

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
all right you got some of the old

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:43.059 
all right you got some of the old
harness<00:02:36.620> strung<00:02:37.190> out<00:02:37.430> here<00:02:38.650> and<00:02:41.650> as<00:02:42.650> you<00:02:42.920> can

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
harness strung out here and as you can

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:54.309 
harness strung out here and as you can
see<00:02:48.040> focus<00:02:49.269> we<00:02:50.269> had<00:02:50.390> some<00:02:50.599> issues<00:02:50.780> there<00:02:53.319> quite

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
see focus we had some issues there quite

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.080 
see focus we had some issues there quite
a<00:02:54.349> lot<00:02:54.560> of<00:02:54.739> issues

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.870 

so<00:02:59.720> I<00:03:01.569> think<00:03:02.569> we're<00:03:02.840> gonna<00:03:03.130> have<00:03:04.130> a<00:03:04.190> new<00:03:04.430> wiring

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
so I think we're gonna have a new wiring

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
so I think we're gonna have a new wiring
harness<00:03:06.970> I've<00:03:07.970> got<00:03:08.180> part<00:03:08.450> of<00:03:08.540> this<00:03:08.660> old

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
harness I've got part of this old

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.240 
harness I've got part of this old
painless<00:03:10.150> wire<00:03:11.150> and<00:03:11.420> deal<00:03:11.600> here<00:03:12.100> it's<00:03:13.100> only

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
painless wire and deal here it's only

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.030 
painless wire and deal here it's only
got<00:03:13.459> some<00:03:13.760> of<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:13.970> wires<00:03:14.209> with<00:03:14.540> it<00:03:14.720> so<00:03:14.930> I<00:03:15.200> got<00:03:16.010> a

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
got some of the wires with it so I got a

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.280 
got some of the wires with it so I got a
bunch<00:03:16.220> of<00:03:16.340> wiring<00:03:16.730> diagrams<00:03:17.300> and<00:03:17.810> I'm<00:03:18.140> gonna

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
bunch of wiring diagrams and I'm gonna

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.449 
bunch of wiring diagrams and I'm gonna
piece<00:03:18.800> something<00:03:19.190> together<00:03:19.310> I<00:03:19.810> got<00:03:20.810> a<00:03:21.250> box<00:03:22.250> a

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
piece something together I got a box a
