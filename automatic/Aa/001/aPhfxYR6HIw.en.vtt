00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.080
 hey hello everyone today i wish i had 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.790
 talk about growth hormone i know what 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.710
 talked about this a million times but 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.800
 today specifically I would like 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.599
 stop at a big bodybuilder henna 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.169
 athletes about it is about guys 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.210
 who have taken a hormone for years this 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.739
 already starting to piss me off a little bit because I 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.200
 I try to give knowledge to the younger 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.309
 generation try to warn them 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.989
 about the growth hormone and insulin side effects 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.329
 just so they understand what it is 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.870
 will pour out if they decide to go for it 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.059
 ways and I for example had no idea what 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.129
 i get involved and side effects 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.679
 appeared when it was actually 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.199
 too late got such shit from 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:01.949
 which no longer get rid of i just wanna 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.260
 so that the younger generation knows about the backstage 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.930
 and the risks associated with this so that they themselves 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.290
 made a wise decision they need it or 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.750
 No, I constantly see these videos where 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.510
 big guys professional athletes 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.659
 They say that this food is food 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.450
 causes their bellies to grow tearing 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.579
 abdominal muscles in half and 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.740
 pushes the navel out why 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:28.259
 just take it and not confess it we 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.110
 did it all and do nothing about it 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.210
 no just people they are not stupid they are not 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.009
 look at the type and well, he said he did not 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.810
 accepts means accepts neither does it 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.299
 I will listen to you and say something regular 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.979
 storyteller young they because they believe in 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.549
 do not know about the backstage 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.159
 growth hormone insulin gf1 will 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.729
 increase your intestines they force 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.729
 all the tissues in the body grow and if you do it 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.549
 and heart and lungs everything will grow 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.219
 big heart often means you 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.810
 glue the flippers before are things that 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.969
 worth taking into account before 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.909
 making a decision but if you decide well 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.429
 you decide it is your decision whether it is worth it 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.110
 that now yes and when you are forty 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.390
 fifty and the doctor says that you have 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.460
 enlarged heart and remained for ten years 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.010
 you do not think this idea 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.890
 awesome i just wanted to get across it 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.490
 up young beginner athletes so they 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.540
 understood that 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:27.370
 all this will impact and steroids but builds 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.520
 they increase your organs not 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.680
 increase the intestines well there others 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.600
 fun but if a course is possible slazit 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.840
 do it safely growth hormone 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.450
 insulin gf1 actually needs them 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.250
 no that's why by the way new 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.620
 bodybuilders generation doesn't look like 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.810
 guys and 70 now for everyone 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.850
 the main thing more is more 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.520
 normal desire to become as you can 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.910
 anymore but in my opinion it should not go in 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:58.570
 aesthetics and what else did you know 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:01.570
 either i'm not growing with the body 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:04.600
 complete nonsense just clear to you if either 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.580
 you 86 centimeters after school then through 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.650
 10 years you can keep the same waist 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.240
 being 120 kilograms bodybuilder mind 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.090
 can just stay away from 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:16.330
 insulin hormone and dressing and a prime example 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.250
 this seventies were cast none of 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.010
 they did not accept them and italy from them 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.750
 remained the same as in youth 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.510
 a200 relatively modern athletes thats 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.100
 same flex wheeler he had a narrow waist 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.800
 there are guys like that though 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.870
 took a little hormone but I just 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.020
 I want you to understand that this is possible 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.270
 belly does not grow just like that with hands and with 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.060
 your body with your legs is all nonsense 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.340
 sheer clear is just an excuse 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.470
 to cover up the fact of saying no 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.900
 i don't take insulin hormone it's just 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.290
 I eat a lot and so it grows it 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.480
 all crap it's all clear I'm talking about it 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.400
 for the younger generation so that they have 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.620
 there was knowledge to take 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.350
 right decision they need it or not 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.810
 I do not drain anyone paraffin anyone 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.060
 I just want people to know the truth and 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.480
 I'll tell her shit that you 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.480
 think 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.829
 not
