00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.300
 Y 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.440
 Well, let's see how they prepare 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.240
 the false spaghetti of zucchini 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.950
 from the grater you asked me 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.439
 several times as I told you 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.110
 can buy in alcampo I bought it 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.939
 me from the fake jman brand for three euros 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.340
 and peak four euros and peak there 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.460
 find it in carrefour the english court 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.540
 in the Chinese in the tree you have it in 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.090
 the kitchenware section with the cutlery 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.640
 to serve the knives and so on 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.980
 what we do is remove the ends 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.739
 to the zucchini this is tremendous of great 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.420
 but there are no smaller ones and only 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.309
 is to slide through the skin there is someone who 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.200
 peel to remove the green and that 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.840
 look more zucchini effect than 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.520
 forgiveness of real spaghetti but good to 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.170
 I like skin and I do not care 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.750
 that you should have got rid of that almost 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.210
 I like it more and it's just like this 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.750
 in scratching as with any grater 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.750
 Made of veggies 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:13.770
 and if selling, the 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.770
 strips as if they were spaghetti 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.340
 let's take out the white zone 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.200
 you have to press hard so that 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.240
 come out thick and consistent because if 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.680
 they come out very finite then they're going to 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.840
 undo in the pan 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.260
 in the microwave organizing like more to 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.260
 the pan 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.979
 Sometimes they come together 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.020
 separate them a little but well you see 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.859
 what's left 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.859
 the spaghetti 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.539
 we have to keep scratching until we get closer 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.149
 to the heart area the area of 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:08.269
 We will leave her heart because having 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.099
 the seeds stays soft and does not 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.800
 it helps us to make false ones 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.660
 Spaghetti breaks and apart the meat 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.000
 of the zucchini in those areas as much 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.250
 softer it does not have the same firmness and 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.599
 they are going to undo us in the pan that 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.380
 is one of the problems we have with 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.380
 these shelves 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.890
 then we will go dragging up 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.870
 that we approach the heart that I 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.540
 what I do is save you see here 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.280
 see the whole area of ​​the seeds all 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.750
 this is already going to leave him he does not deserve the 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.780
 It's a shame to hurry more, it breaks, you see 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.040
 Nail the grater I have been the zones 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.209
 what are we going to keep them for when I do 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.190
 puree the hours they cut they wrap them in 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.640
 aluminum and I keep them for when I do 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.959
 for him and these spaghetti these false 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.349
 spaghetti are the ones that we are now going to 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.349
 Cook 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.780
 well then to cook the fake ones 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.890
 noodles what we need is that the 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.890
 pan is very hot 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.080
 and we take them 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.820
 and better they make them hot 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.800
 because they will be very little time to 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.290
 fire because if they do not fall apart and the 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.540
 zucchini is already possible cooking 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.370
 fast but also to be spinning so 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.920
 fine 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.490
 what is going on 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.960
 in the minutes 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.920
 invite them, we are leaving it like this 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.090
 let it be done a little before 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.640
 practically all he does is 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.410
 cut 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.780
 and the moment and we'll give it a spin and 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.580
 if you want, you can take a leap 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.470
 of vinegar and salt and then there is almost 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.370
 more do it at the time of serving 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.370
 but that and taste 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:56.020
 at the age of return you will soon notice 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.120
 if he gets very poached he 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.800
 he is here right away you are going to see the 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.690
 moment of cooking by is the softness 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.530
 so soft that he 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.530
 the zucchini 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.890
 If kidnaps and let time also 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.790
 in the end what you are going to do is get rid 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:16.489
 if it falls apart then submit it is kind 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:19.220
 You put pudding in a silver ring and 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.880
 I also used it 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.530
 but let's go the dreams that remain 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.120
 and also that I like the truth is 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.850
 very little cooked vegetables that I like 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.290
 that remain so raw and long type that 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.660
 for me, this zucchini is already 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.000
 you see, it's not stiff, it 's very 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.050
 malleable very soft and if we leave it 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.910
 more time the only thing that we are going to 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.460
 get is to get rid is worth the 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.200
 green areas are a little bit more 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.480
 you think more consistent but it's that 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.220
 this is enough from there already 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.270
 begins to release water and fixes 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.270
 needs to be done 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.090
 so now we 're going to turn it off we're going to 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.620
 take 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.180
 this is how we would be finished 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.240
 as I told you I would add now the 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.980
 trickle of oil and what you want 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.740
 So, for example, add paprika 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.990
 You will see that you already know that I benefit 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.550
 a lot of paprika or anything else 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.080
 to give if you want a little more 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.639
 taste 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.560
 good on this occasion we have been 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:15.009
 consistent how it was done can happen 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.360
 that we are left soft in that case 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:19.110
 I advise you to take advantage of those that 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.340
 you use a ring of plating like this 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.340
 it's worth filling 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.540
 there are also metallic rings 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.100
 but I really like this 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.950
 which is plastic because it does not spoil 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:32.650
 never rust is a package of these 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.760
 that come with three different sizes and 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.070
 the truth is that super practical for 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.870
 present the rice because above all it remains 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:42.180
 very beautiful presented or what you have 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.180
 seen in my dishes in my photos 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.340
 you give a little consistency yes yes 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.770
 it has remained soft to us as it will be 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.599
 Mash will still be refilled better and then 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.340
 only the ring remains and with 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:58.289
 whatever you present it has 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.150
 a lot of presence and it looks great so 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:02.009
 Well I hope you like it and that what 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.560
 enjoy point if you liked you 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:07.050
 I would appreciate that you dedicate like or leave 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.970
 Any comment and you'll tell me if 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.300
 you have proven how much you have gone 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.300
 Thank you
