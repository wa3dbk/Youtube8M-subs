did is I just added a little bit in the
corner<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.530> what<00:00:46.530> I've<00:00:46.649> noticed<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:47.340> know<00:00:47.460> if

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.630 
corner and what I've noticed you know if
you<00:00:47.640> packing<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.329> comes<00:00:48.600> off<00:00:48.840> first<00:00:49.370> the<00:00:50.370> rest

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
you packing it comes off first the rest

of the tab before this little corner so
I'm<00:00:53.699> pretty<00:00:54.090> sure<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.809> helps<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.379> hearing<00:00:55.860> it

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.069 
I'm pretty sure it helps and hearing it
better<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.520> when<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.730> get<00:00:57.239> some<00:00:57.390> extra<00:00:57.690> cash<00:00:57.870> I'm

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
leftover adhesive on this half so that

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.950 
leftover adhesive on this half so that
in<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.650> morning<00:01:13.830> when<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.369> add<00:01:15.090> some<00:01:15.509> more<00:01:15.689> to

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
in the morning when I add some more to

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.740 
in the morning when I add some more to
it<00:01:16.110> it's<00:01:16.520> already<00:01:17.520> kind<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.909> sticky<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:18.630> it

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
it it's already kind of sticky so it

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.429 
it it's already kind of sticky so it
helps<00:01:19.080> out<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.259> believe<00:01:21.170> something<00:01:22.170> I've

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
helps out I believe something I've

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.170 
helps out I believe something I've
learned<00:01:22.650> from<00:01:22.770> Lola<00:01:23.009> Jake<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.520> switching<00:01:24.000> from

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
learned from Lola Jake is switching from

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.340 
learned from Lola Jake is switching from
boxers<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.810> boxer-briefs<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:26.340> there's<00:01:26.549> less

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
boxers to boxer-briefs so there's less

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.920 
boxers to boxer-briefs so there's less
availability<00:01:28.350> for<00:01:28.530> movement<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.930> gyrating

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
availability for movement and gyrating

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.870 
availability for movement and gyrating
around<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.500> know<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.490> stays<00:01:32.670> on

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
around you know so that it stays on

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.499 
around you know so that it stays on
longer<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:34.380> wear<00:01:34.560> boxer<00:01:34.890> briefs<00:01:35.159> now<00:01:36.060> for

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
longer so I wear boxer briefs now for

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.840 
longer so I wear boxer briefs now for
added<00:01:36.930> support<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.740> know<00:01:37.890> instability<00:01:38.549> on

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
added support you know instability on

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.889 
added support you know instability on
the<00:01:38.970> days<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.479> pack<00:01:41.450> packing<00:01:42.450> lines<00:01:42.659> it

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
the days that I pack packing lines it

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.410 
the days that I pack packing lines it
doesn't<00:01:43.049> bounce<00:01:43.290> around<00:01:43.470> like<00:01:43.740> global<00:01:44.159> Jake

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
doesn't bounce around like global Jake

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.719 
doesn't bounce around like global Jake
probably<00:01:45.420> because<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:46.079> been<00:01:46.920> wearing<00:01:47.220> back<00:01:47.520> to

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
probably because I been wearing back to

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.950 
probably because I been wearing back to
bridge<00:01:47.970> two<00:01:48.829> plus<00:01:49.829> heavier<00:01:50.420> it<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.659> don't<00:01:51.899> think

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
bridge two plus heavier it I don't think

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.510 
bridge two plus heavier it I don't think
