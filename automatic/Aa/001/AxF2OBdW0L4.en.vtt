noticed that I know that doesn't look
right<00:01:36.200> I'm<00:01:37.200> probably<00:01:37.439> going<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.740> take<00:01:37.860> this

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
right I'm probably going to take this

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.010 
right I'm probably going to take this
back<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.430> was<00:01:38.610> trying<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.909> make<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.240> work<00:01:39.540> over

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
back I was trying to make it work over

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.960 
back I was trying to make it work over
the<00:01:40.170> Rachel<00:01:40.500> k<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.740> see<00:01:41.100> if<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.549> made<00:01:41.939> a

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
the Rachel k to see if that made a

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.780 
the Rachel k to see if that made a
difference<00:01:42.590> whether<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.890> would<00:01:44.040> maybe<00:01:44.549> not

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
difference whether it would maybe not

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.789 
difference whether it would maybe not
oxidize<00:01:45.270> or<00:01:45.299> something<00:01:45.810> but<00:01:46.020> we'll<00:01:46.560> see<00:01:46.770> how

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
oxidize or something but we'll see how

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.460 
oxidize or something but we'll see how
it<00:01:46.979> goes<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:49.020> guess<00:01:49.259> was<00:01:49.439> a

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
it goes so this is this I guess was a

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.980 
it goes so this is this I guess was a
fail<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.189> then<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.820> also<00:01:51.000> wanted<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.479> try<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.750> new

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
fail and then I also wanted to try a new

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.609 
fail and then I also wanted to try a new
hair<00:01:52.590> oil<00:01:52.920> /<00:01:53.430> theorem<00:01:53.939> I'm<00:01:54.149> still<00:01:54.420> using<00:01:54.689> the

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
hair oil / theorem I'm still using the

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.760 
hair oil / theorem I'm still using the
josie<00:01:56.159> maran<00:01:56.520> one<00:01:57.030> but<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.329> saw<00:01:57.930> this<00:01:58.229> one<00:01:58.560> this

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
josie maran one but I saw this one this

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.740 
josie maran one but I saw this one this
is<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:58.979> Oscar<00:01:59.640> blondie<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.329> think<00:02:00.630> it's

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
is the Oscar blondie I think it's

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.399 
is the Oscar blondie I think it's
pronounced<00:02:01.290> hair<00:02:02.280> serum<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.570> Jasmine<00:02:04.140> oil

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
pronounced hair serum is the Jasmine oil

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.429 
pronounced hair serum is the Jasmine oil
and<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:06.240> reviews<00:02:06.600> were<00:02:06.689> really<00:02:07.200> really<00:02:07.320> good

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
and the reviews were really really good

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.130 
and the reviews were really really good
so<00:02:07.829> I<00:02:08.099> decided<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:09.090> go<00:02:09.239> ahead<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.599> order<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:09.989> I

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
so I decided to go ahead and order it I

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.650 
so I decided to go ahead and order it I
had

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
had

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.290 
had
in<00:02:10.840> my<00:02:10.990> hair<00:02:11.230> today<00:02:12.160> my<00:02:12.340> hair<00:02:12.550> has<00:02:12.640> gotten<00:02:12.760> so

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
in my hair today my hair has gotten so

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.100 
in my hair today my hair has gotten so
long<00:02:14.760> basically<00:02:15.760> because<00:02:15.970> if<00:02:16.330> pregnancy<00:02:16.840> and

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
long basically because if pregnancy and

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.770 
long basically because if pregnancy and
I<00:02:17.200> kept<00:02:17.530> in<00:02:17.890> it<00:02:18.070> it<00:02:18.490> in<00:02:18.700> a<00:02:18.820> bun<00:02:19.000> and<00:02:19.030> I<00:02:19.270> was<00:02:19.420> blow

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
I kept in it it in a bun and I was blow

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.020 
I kept in it it in a bun and I was blow
drying<00:02:19.810> it<00:02:20.350> and<00:02:20.560> that<00:02:21.400> really<00:02:21.520> does<00:02:21.790> make<00:02:21.970> a

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
drying it and that really does make a

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.800 
drying it and that really does make a
difference<00:02:22.300> like<00:02:22.660> keeping<00:02:23.080> your<00:02:23.380> hair<00:02:23.620> up<00:02:23.830> and

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
difference like keeping your hair up and

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.140 
difference like keeping your hair up and
not<00:02:25.810> blow<00:02:26.080> drying<00:02:26.350> it<00:02:26.620> so<00:02:26.890> I<00:02:27.190> just<00:02:27.760> basically

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
not blow drying it so I just basically

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.050 
not blow drying it so I just basically
get<00:02:28.420> out<00:02:28.540> of<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.750> shower<00:02:29.100> put<00:02:30.100> some<00:02:30.670> sort<00:02:30.910> of<00:02:30.970> a

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
get out of the shower put some sort of a

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.460 
get out of the shower put some sort of a
hair<00:02:31.270> serum<00:02:31.600> on<00:02:31.690> and<00:02:31.930> just<00:02:32.050> let<00:02:32.230> it<00:02:32.320> air<00:02:32.440> dry

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
hair serum on and just let it air dry
