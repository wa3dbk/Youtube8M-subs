00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.250
 in chillán he has been in the team for a short time, returning to the theme of 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:04.290
 next Saturday 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.290
 like comets to players like watermelon encourage incentives to play 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.320
 against another team this one also in view of the tournament fight 

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:16.150
 always successful luckily we play with coma 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.039
 the first match with 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.180
 with one of the pointers and the second match also and that 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.169
 obviously it is one more stimulus for the players not 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:29.019
 they are river players and they are good players 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:31.199
 and they feel 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.770
 incentivated before rivals 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.260
 of that magnitude attention 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.930
 I think it's good for us to play at least on the premises per game I do not know 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:41.570
 yes 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.140
 they have not gone so well or not but in the previous 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.190
 it's good to play against teams of that nature 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.300
 being river 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.460
 so 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.550
 I said I'm fine 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.980
 let's say very happy that it is but that they are those rivals and no other what 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.200
 that we have to face 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.540
 the Syrian regime good students is the hardest rival I can give you 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.730
 of polito claveles 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.670
 while indirect 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.119
 he got an idea of ​​how many points it would be good to get in these five 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.119
 matches and got three 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.159
 but well let's see 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.640
 and with everything for mac 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.759
 no no no no no no no accounts do we go match by match and 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.760
 try to play better than DDT 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.070
 to answer what river means, especially not 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.170
 well the mini team imip my big concern is that the team 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.470
 although 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.470
 a worthy representative of what he writes football 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.130
 for now not beautiful of course to win that 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.280
 for a while what I can not 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.990
 but the big concern is that we do not have a shirt that 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.990
 it's a school 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.750
 they have secured a table football and it has to be 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.750
 Worthy that shirt as much as possible or at least try it 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.870
 try to be worthy of 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.280
 of the river shirt for now do not play as well as possible
