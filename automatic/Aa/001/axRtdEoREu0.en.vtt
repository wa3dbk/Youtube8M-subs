00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
activate the noises so that makes it

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.649 
activate the noises so that makes it
look<00:01:43.799> weird<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.640> does<00:01:44.850> have<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.090> nice<00:01:45.329> cloth

compared<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.630> like<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.960> know<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.200> plastic

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
compared to like you know the plastic

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.899 
compared to like you know the plastic
ones<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.890> past<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.369> that's<00:01:50.520> really<00:01:50.729> cool

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
ones of the past so that's really cool

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.060 
ones of the past so that's really cool
to<00:01:51.030> have<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.229> so<00:01:52.229> this<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.680> all<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.799> know<00:01:52.950> it's

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
to have that so this is all I know it's

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.670 
to have that so this is all I know it's
not<00:01:53.130> on<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.490> turn<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.759> on<00:01:53.850> push<00:01:54.090> on<00:01:54.680> make

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
not on so to turn it on push on make

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.100 
not on so to turn it on push on make
that<00:01:55.710> activation<00:01:56.250> noise<00:01:56.549> so<00:01:57.360> standardly<00:01:57.960> when

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
that activation noise so standardly when

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.819 
that activation noise so standardly when
you<00:01:58.170> push<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.409> up<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.860> like<00:01:59.040> this<00:01:59.159> noise<00:01:59.369> and

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
you push it up and like this noise and

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:02.959 
you push it up and like this noise and
and<00:02:01.829> then<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.100> noise<00:02:02.280> when<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.579> push<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.759> in

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
and then that noise when you push it in

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.200 
and then that noise when you push it in
so<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:04.110> comes<00:02:04.439> with<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:05.040> ultimate

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
so it comes with the ultimate

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.779 
so it comes with the ultimate
Humongousaur<00:02:06.210> disc<00:02:06.530> here<00:02:07.530> now<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.310> was

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
Humongousaur disc here now I was

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.249 
Humongousaur disc here now I was
practicing<00:02:09.300> with<00:02:09.330> this<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.899> doesn't<00:02:10.200> seem

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
practicing with this and it doesn't seem

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.290 
practicing with this and it doesn't seem
to<00:02:10.349> want<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.590> say<00:02:10.709> its<00:02:10.860> name<00:02:11.099> but<00:02:11.879> let's<00:02:12.000> try<00:02:12.239> it

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
to want to say its name but let's try it

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.940 
to want to say its name but let's try it
anyway<00:02:12.390> make<00:02:12.810> may<00:02:13.200> say<00:02:13.410> water

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
anyway make may say water

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.770 
anyway make may say water
so<00:02:14.400> we're<00:02:14.610> gonna<00:02:14.730> slide<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.209> disc<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:15.660> you

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
so we're gonna slide the disc and you

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.589 
so we're gonna slide the disc and you
slide<00:02:16.020> it<00:02:16.110> in<00:02:16.230> like<00:02:16.260> this<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:17.360> wait<00:02:18.360> for<00:02:18.480> my

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
slide it in like this and wait for my

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.080 
slide it in like this and wait for my
confirmation<00:02:18.930> there<00:02:19.379> we<00:02:19.440> go

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
confirmation there we go

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.550 
confirmation there we go
then<00:02:21.090> it'll<00:02:21.209> make<00:02:21.360> us<00:02:21.510> standing<00:02:21.840> by<00:02:21.959> noise<00:02:22.170> and

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
then it'll make us standing by noise and

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.750 
then it'll make us standing by noise and
then<00:02:22.680> push<00:02:22.890> us<00:02:23.040> up<00:02:27.709> no<00:02:28.709> sir<00:02:29.010> that<00:02:29.280> is<00:02:29.310> not<00:02:29.400> water

and<00:06:17.719> then<00:06:18.259> it<00:06:18.409> also<00:06:18.590> it<00:06:18.800> doesn't<00:06:18.949> give<00:06:19.099> you

00:06:19.179 --> 00:06:19.189 
and then it also it doesn't give you

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:20.559 
and then it also it doesn't give you
that<00:06:19.219> feel<00:06:19.580> like<00:06:19.759> the<00:06:19.939> view<00:06:20.090> scope<00:06:20.300> is<00:06:20.479> you

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:20.569 
that feel like the view scope is you

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:21.580 
that feel like the view scope is you
know<00:06:20.659> when<00:06:20.749> you<00:06:20.809> push<00:06:20.960> it<00:06:21.110> down<00:06:21.139> like<00:06:21.439> your

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.590 
know when you push it down like your

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.339 
know when you push it down like your
hero<00:06:21.770> it<00:06:22.729> just<00:06:23.330> doesn't<00:06:23.659> have<00:06:23.779> that<00:06:23.930> feel<00:06:24.139> to

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:24.349 
hero it just doesn't have that feel to

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:26.739 
hero it just doesn't have that feel to
it<00:06:24.469> the<00:06:24.590> way<00:06:24.680> the<00:06:24.830> mechanism<00:06:25.279> works<00:06:25.490> the<00:06:26.300> disks

00:06:26.739 --> 00:06:26.749 
it the way the mechanism works the disks

00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:29.379 
it the way the mechanism works the disks
can<00:06:26.960> get<00:06:27.110> stuck<00:06:27.379> in<00:06:27.559> here<00:06:27.589> really<00:06:27.919> easily<00:06:28.389> and

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:29.389 
can get stuck in here really easily and

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:31.629 
can get stuck in here really easily and
no<00:06:29.599> sounds<00:06:30.050> for<00:06:30.199> low<00:06:30.259> star<00:06:30.499> and<00:06:30.620> wrath<00:06:30.770> and<00:06:31.039> the

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:31.639 
no sounds for low star and wrath and the

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:33.189 
no sounds for low star and wrath and the
fact<00:06:31.879> that<00:06:31.999> only<00:06:32.270> has<00:06:32.479> it<00:06:32.599> sounds<00:06:32.870> it's<00:06:33.050> nice

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:33.199 
fact that only has it sounds it's nice

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:34.510 
fact that only has it sounds it's nice
to<00:06:33.379> have<00:06:33.499> the<00:06:33.589> sounds<00:06:33.830> with<00:06:33.949> also<00:06:34.129> an<00:06:34.219> alien's

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:34.520 
to have the sounds with also an alien's

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.429 
to have the sounds with also an alien's
but<00:06:34.669> technically<00:06:34.969> you<00:06:35.509> can<00:06:35.659> never<00:06:35.809> use<00:06:36.169> the

00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:36.439 
but technically you can never use the

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:38.739 
but technically you can never use the
holograms<00:06:37.249> for<00:06:37.400> the<00:06:37.490> ultimate<00:06:37.759> alien<00:06:38.089> so<00:06:38.360> it's

00:06:38.739 --> 00:06:38.749 
holograms for the ultimate alien so it's

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:40.469 
holograms for the ultimate alien so it's
just<00:06:38.809> kind<00:06:39.080> of<00:06:39.110> a<00:06:39.229> disappointment<00:06:39.740> all<00:06:39.949> around
