back for a PI waving high and serving
the<00:01:14.249> PI<00:01:14.429> so<00:01:14.759> this<00:01:14.819> is<00:01:14.999> the<00:01:15.090> first<00:01:15.299> three

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:15.539

one sink back and we're going to turn
around<00:02:18.640> directions<00:02:19.480> so<00:02:19.660> to<00:02:19.720> step<00:02:20.379> together

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
around directions so to step together

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.420 
around directions so to step together
parallel<00:02:21.599> sink<00:02:22.599> back<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:23.200> three<00:02:23.830> step<00:02:24.250> out

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
parallel sink back and three step out

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.530 
parallel sink back and three step out
and<00:02:24.610> you're<00:02:24.700> ready<00:02:24.819> to<00:02:24.940> return<00:02:25.269> the<00:02:25.420> other

and you're ready to return the other

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.229 
and you're ready to return the other
direction<00:02:26.519> here<00:02:27.519> we<00:02:27.640> going<00:02:27.760> to<00:02:27.819> change<00:02:28.030> it

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
direction here we going to change it

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.199 
direction here we going to change it
slightly<00:02:28.360> one<00:02:28.959> sink<00:02:29.530> back<00:02:29.800> to<00:02:30.519> turn<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:31.000> foot

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
slightly one sink back to turn the foot

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:32.729 
slightly one sink back to turn the foot
out<00:02:31.300> more<00:02:31.540> and<00:02:31.690> it's<00:02:31.810> like<00:02:31.870> your<00:02:32.080> body's<00:02:32.709> a

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
out more and it's like your body's a

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.339 
out more and it's like your body's a
door<00:02:33.069> and<00:02:33.250> you're<00:02:33.400> going<00:02:33.519> to<00:02:33.549> close<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:34.030> door

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
door and you're going to close the door

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.210 
door and you're going to close the door
step<00:02:35.349> out<00:02:35.560> forward<00:02:36.069> and<00:02:36.280> open<00:02:37.269> the<00:02:37.360> door

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
step out forward and open the door

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.589 
step out forward and open the door
so<00:02:39.220> this<00:02:39.310> movements<00:02:39.670> not<00:02:39.760> diagonal<00:02:40.299> it's<00:02:40.420> more

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
so this movements not diagonal it's more

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.600 
so this movements not diagonal it's more
straight<00:02:40.870> ahead<00:02:40.989> this<00:02:41.319> is<00:02:41.379> the<00:02:41.680> second<00:02:42.430> three

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
straight ahead this is the second three

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.880 
straight ahead this is the second three
step<00:02:42.819> movement<00:02:43.030> brush<00:02:43.959> knee<00:02:44.230> twist<00:02:44.650> step

finishing<00:04:08.440> up<00:04:09.209> we're<00:04:10.209> going<00:04:10.299> to<00:04:10.389> do<00:04:10.450> that<00:04:10.599> one

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
finishing up we're going to do that one

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:11.370 
finishing up we're going to do that one
more<00:04:10.780> time
