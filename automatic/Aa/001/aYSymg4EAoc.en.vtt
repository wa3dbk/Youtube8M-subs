that's closer to me where I'm at here in
Missouri<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.509> I'm<00:01:15.990> gonna<00:01:16.140> take<00:01:16.350> probably<00:01:16.530> six

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
Missouri so I'm gonna take probably six

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.249 
Missouri so I'm gonna take probably six
hours<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.820> some<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.180> modulars<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.110> it's

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
hours and some of the modulars and it's

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.530 
hours and some of the modulars and it's
kind<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.619> like<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.860> train<00:01:20.159> show<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:21.240> it'd<00:01:21.390> be<00:01:21.509> a

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
kind of like a train show so it'd be a

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.020 
kind of like a train show so it'd be a
lot<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.810> trains<00:01:22.229> not<00:01:22.770> necessarily<00:01:23.430> all<00:01:23.580> Lego

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
lot of trains not necessarily all Lego

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.670 
lot of trains not necessarily all Lego
trains<00:01:24.390> was<00:01:24.659> just<00:01:24.869> other<00:01:25.020> trains<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.560> stuff

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680

a<00:02:06.570> bunch<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.320> like<00:02:07.619> desert<00:02:08.550> section<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.450> was

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
a bunch of like desert section it was

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.570 
a bunch of like desert section it was
really<00:02:09.899> cool<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.140> was<00:02:10.530> really<00:02:10.619> awesome

really cool it was really awesome

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.940 
really cool it was really awesome
it<00:02:12.150> sounds<00:02:12.420> like<00:02:12.510> they<00:02:12.720> only<00:02:12.930> get<00:02:13.230> there<00:02:13.410> once

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
it sounds like they only get there once

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.710 
it sounds like they only get there once
when<00:02:14.310> they<00:02:14.459> have<00:02:14.819> the<00:02:14.970> Lugg<00:02:15.180> meeting<00:02:15.569> and

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
when they have the Lugg meeting and

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.140 
when they have the Lugg meeting and
clean<00:02:15.959> it<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.440> seems<00:02:17.280> like<00:02:17.490> the<00:02:17.640> train<00:02:17.880> motor

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
clean it and seems like the train motor

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.699 
clean it and seems like the train motor
burns<00:02:18.480> out<00:02:18.720> every<00:02:18.870> time<00:02:19.020> I<00:02:19.050> think<00:02:19.230> that<00:02:19.319> train

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
burns out every time I think that train

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.440 
burns out every time I think that train
is<00:02:19.920> set<00:02:20.099> up<00:02:20.190> so<00:02:20.489> it<00:02:20.550> just<00:02:20.760> kind<00:02:20.970> of<00:02:21.000> runs<00:02:21.150> on

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
is set up so it just kind of runs on

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.199 
is set up so it just kind of runs on
stop<00:02:21.810> once<00:02:22.140> he's<00:02:23.010> triggered<00:02:23.550> by<00:02:23.700> somebody

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
stop once he's triggered by somebody

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.330 
stop once he's triggered by somebody
maybe<00:02:24.420> motion<00:02:25.020> or<00:02:25.140> whatnot<00:02:25.319> and<00:02:25.709> then<00:02:26.220> they

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
maybe motion or whatnot and then they

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.120 
maybe motion or whatnot and then they
had<00:02:26.489> another<00:02:26.840> display<00:02:27.840> they<00:02:28.170> had<00:02:28.349> like<00:02:28.590> the

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
had another display they had like the

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.610
