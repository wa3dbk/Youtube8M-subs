one<00:03:32.709> of<00:03:32.799> these<00:03:32.919> parks<00:03:33.310> Peters<00:03:33.780> so<00:03:34.780> yeah<00:03:35.139> so

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129 
one of these parks Peters so yeah so

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:37.619 
one of these parks Peters so yeah so
that'll<00:03:36.459> be<00:03:36.519> cool<00:03:36.669> to<00:03:36.940> get<00:03:37.030> a<00:03:37.090> couple<00:03:37.389> of<00:03:37.479> those

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:37.629 
that'll be cool to get a couple of those

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:41.939 
that'll be cool to get a couple of those
because<00:03:38.079> in<00:03:38.290> episode<00:03:38.739> 3<00:03:40.109> some<00:03:41.109> of<00:03:41.229> those<00:03:41.530> recon

Grievous's wheel bike which is on you to

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.140 
Grievous's wheel bike which is on you to
pollen<00:04:57.290> he<00:04:57.380> tries<00:04:57.590> to<00:04:57.620> escape<00:04:57.920> with<00:04:58.280> it<00:04:58.490> this

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
pollen he tries to escape with it this

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.790 
pollen he tries to escape with it this
is<00:04:59.450> what<00:04:59.750> it<00:04:59.870> looks<00:05:00.110> like<00:05:00.290> if<00:05:00.530> you<00:05:00.650> guys

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
is what it looks like if you guys

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.360 
is what it looks like if you guys
remember<00:05:01.430> down<00:05:02.420> with<00:05:02.570> these<00:05:02.660> in<00:05:02.750> 2005<00:05:03.410> this<00:05:04.190> is

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
remember down with these in 2005 this is

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.490 
remember down with these in 2005 this is
broken<00:05:04.730> this<00:05:04.940> is<00:05:05.030> what<00:05:05.150> it<00:05:05.270> looked<00:05:05.480> like<00:05:05.540> so<00:05:06.350> if

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
broken this is what it looked like so if

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.410 
broken this is what it looked like so if
we<00:05:06.590> get<00:05:06.710> another<00:05:06.890> one<00:05:07.040> of<00:05:07.160> those<00:05:07.250> be<00:05:07.880> awesome

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:08.420 
we get another one of those be awesome

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.450 
we get another one of those be awesome
maybe<00:05:09.020> another<00:05:09.230> 212<00:05:09.710> trooper<00:05:10.070> because<00:05:10.250> in<00:05:10.370> the

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
maybe another 212 trooper because in the

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:11.890 
maybe another 212 trooper because in the
scene<00:05:10.670> it<00:05:10.850> shows<00:05:11.030> it<00:05:11.180> running<00:05:11.390> over<00:05:11.630> some<00:05:11.870> of

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
scene it shows it running over some of

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.580 
scene it shows it running over some of
them<00:05:12.110> and<00:05:12.640> probably<00:05:13.640> comes<00:05:13.880> to<00:05:13.970> only<00:05:14.090> one<00:05:14.590> but

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
them and probably comes to only one but

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.440 
them and probably comes to only one but
the<00:05:15.890> thing<00:05:15.920> is<00:05:16.130> they'll<00:05:16.670> have<00:05:16.820> to<00:05:16.850> do<00:05:17.060> a<00:05:17.090> new

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
the thing is they'll have to do a new

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.660 
the thing is they'll have to do a new
General<00:05:17.900> Grievous<00:05:18.050> mold<00:05:18.410> design<00:05:18.670> because

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:19.670 
General Grievous mold design because

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.400 
General Grievous mold design because
they<00:05:19.790> can't<00:05:20.000> use<00:05:20.120> the<00:05:20.210> clone<00:05:20.360> wars<00:05:20.600> one<00:05:20.840> so

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
they can't use the clone wars one so

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.080 
they can't use the clone wars one so
maybe<00:05:21.530> the<00:05:21.710> new<00:05:21.800> it<00:05:21.920> cool<00:05:22.400> new<00:05:22.730> General

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.760 
maybe the new it cool new General
Grievous<00:05:23.270> design<00:05:23.690> which<00:05:24.230> would<00:05:24.380> be<00:05:24.500> really

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
Grievous design which would be really

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.460
