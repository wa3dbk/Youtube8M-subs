00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 and what I noticed this weekend now I know 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.620
 it was a difficult weekend for myself to minimize wilfred 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.240
 belgium after those months yard look where it concerns me the theme where it me 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.660
 what matters is that nobody is concerned at the beginning of this year 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.790
 watch a moment when someone is also just stupid about this opponent in it 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:17.890
 live those three times 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.020
 yes then we have nothing more adventurous to watch guess what 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:22.439
 what can this be but yes 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.389
 but i have a few move the second half psv the second or you ever whole match 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.259
 you see people doing things 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.000
 However, wonder what kind of suspect that I have some other hence you 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.360
 see people do things it really sit on the couch and then you think 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.229
 what inspires such a person 

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:43.340
 such a person has no television 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.150
 never look at the other players i saw the bone 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.870
 look at it these moments you need what you have not seen this moment 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.110
 some debate like everyone else in the Netherlands 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.320
 Danny Holla For me it is about people like CEO that he gets a start with a ball 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.640
 beautiful that is coming and then no other can not look what he 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.920
 what the boy does and then a little bit 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.680
 how the hell do you get it in your head and those are things 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.820
 We already have a pity that we do what it means that it was fun 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.280
 just beautiful 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.549
 yes but I think even he always wanted half a year after his departure 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.870
 We are waiting to see what does not discourage you 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.680
 and the left shooting away yes 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.160
 And then I think those are things that come to John Terry or do you want those coins or 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.990
 in the past they were about news about how they also huub stevens 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.590
 that plays a major role 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.380
 don't get in my head on 9 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.560
 and if you look at it then a week 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.510
 there is also no one who says if those walking away attract try to do the 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.510
 and this means that those are things when you are watching 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.310
 that people who think with it 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.460
 how the hell do I choose and that 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.790
 there is an English competition right now that could have consequences 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.950
 soccer players correct each other 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.320
 and then you must have that which high the pecking order 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.870
 look if you felt this did the story is that the jupiler league has that information 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.420
 gathering told again leaving a little know I know a few days 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.000
 no more like a true hero then there were still bosses in the dressing room and 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.990
 on the field and that want to play football says team needs more than one 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.989
 boss 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.669
 a trainer is paid in the field
