role in food security and food safety in

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.720 
role in food security and food safety in
two<00:00:20.850> ways<00:00:21.230> first<00:00:22.230> we<00:00:22.740> look<00:00:22.949> for<00:00:23.010> products<00:00:23.640> that

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
two ways first we look for products that

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.509 
two ways first we look for products that
can<00:00:24.000> help<00:00:24.240> enhance<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:25.410> yield<00:00:25.769> which<00:00:26.310> is

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
can help enhance the yield which is

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.179 
can help enhance the yield which is
providing<00:00:27.180> for<00:00:27.510> food<00:00:27.810> security<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.769> second

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
providing for food security the second

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.990 
providing for food security the second
thing<00:00:29.310> around<00:00:29.609> food<00:00:30.599> security<00:00:31.109> is<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:32.130> the

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
thing around food security is that the

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.420 
thing around food security is that the
public<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.290> people<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.710> are<00:00:34.770> consuming

public of the people that are consuming

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.950 
public of the people that are consuming
the<00:00:35.550> food<00:00:35.760> they<00:00:36.120> want<00:00:36.329> an<00:00:36.420> assurance<00:00:36.780> that

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
time we deal with local growers and

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.300 
time we deal with local growers and
local<00:01:07.790> producers<00:01:08.300> that<00:01:08.690> are<00:01:08.860> focused<00:01:09.860> on
