00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.599
 these recipes of the simplest we are going to 

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:12.940
 bring normal milk first to fire 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:15.900
 slow and we will add the other milks 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.900
 evaporated milk 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.119
 and condensed milk 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:31.510
 and we are going to perfectly incorporate all 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:37.120
 the milk and let's wait for it to go 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:39.340
 to boil well now let's hydrate the 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.350
 jelly by placing a cup of water in 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.989
 a container the lake should not be 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.700
 seething but it should not be 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.390
 cold and we're going to place all the envelopes 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.390
 of big tub 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.649
 once we dissolve the one attacked by 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.739
 full we are going to set aside a 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.239
 moment and we are going to chop our strawberries 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.180
 in this way in the way that you 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.970
 really want when you're about to 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.950
 the boil our milk we will 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.440
 remove from the fire and we will incorporate 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.890
 the grenetina that we had previously 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.890
 hydrated 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.619
 and we are going to incorporate completely 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:31.799
 and once we fully incorporate 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.799
 it's time to add our strawberries 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.750
 and once we fully incorporate 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.570
 let's let it cool a little before 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.539
 to take the mold to take it to 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.340
 refrigerator to set well now just 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.860
 we have left, it's better to refrigerate and wait 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.890
 that set and once it's over 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.600
 let's disassemble in this way and the 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.130
 let's decorate with whatever we want 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.829
 this time I will occupy lunettes 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.769
 because I'm going to give it to a nephew 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:14.160
 mine but you can occupy what you 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:17.010
 like fruit or whatever you like 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.080
 well so the strawberries are finally 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.570
 are left at the bottom when 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.160
 you'll notice if it's me 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.740
 possible I will take a picture at the time 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.180
 to leave, and if not, they will remain 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.100
 with the desire and until you 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.530
 do or can you present it from this 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.660
 individual form as you like this is 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.340
 the idea I hope you like them to vote 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.810
 they comment that they subscribe and we 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.040
 we see in the next tutorial that I 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.040
 I hope it's coming soon goodbye
