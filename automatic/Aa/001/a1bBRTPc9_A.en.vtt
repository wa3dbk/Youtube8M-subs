00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.679 

so<00:00:23.310> we've<00:00:23.430> come<00:00:23.580> about<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.849> mile<00:00:24.119> in<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.360> corner

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
so we've come about a mile in the corner

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.510 
so we've come about a mile in the corner
we've<00:00:25.200> got<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.349> nice<00:00:25.560> big<00:00:25.770> talus<00:00:26.099> field<00:00:26.340> here

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:26.520 
we've got a nice big talus field here

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.160

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:32.170 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.420 

so<00:00:33.170> if<00:00:33.260> all<00:00:33.380> the<00:00:33.500> snow<00:00:33.739> and<00:00:33.770> rain<00:00:34.040> we<00:00:34.160> had<00:00:34.280> this

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
so if all the snow and rain we had this

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.460 
so if all the snow and rain we had this
season<00:00:34.670> this<00:00:35.180> trail<00:00:35.510> is<00:00:35.600> just<00:00:35.780> soaked<00:00:36.110> we're

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.470

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.549 

so<00:00:44.329> this<00:00:44.480> altitude<00:00:44.780> running<00:00:45.140> into<00:00:45.320> a<00:00:45.350> lot<00:00:45.530> of

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
so this altitude running into a lot of

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:47.049 
so this altitude running into a lot of
snow<00:00:45.860> as<00:00:46.190> you<00:00:46.399> can<00:00:46.520> see<00:00:46.640> the<00:00:46.760> Sonoma

underneath the snow leave some gaps

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.619 
underneath the snow leave some gaps
sometimes<00:00:49.340> it<00:00:49.700> can<00:00:49.820> be<00:00:49.910> easy<00:00:50.059> to<00:00:50.120> fall<00:00:50.390> in<00:00:50.510> so

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
sometimes it can be easy to fall in so
