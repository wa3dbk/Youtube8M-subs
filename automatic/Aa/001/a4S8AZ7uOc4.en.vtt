tree inside it

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.320 
tree inside it
and<00:02:12.650> so<00:02:13.280> you<00:02:13.580> know<00:02:13.700> thinking<00:02:14.030> about<00:02:14.210> the

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
and so you know thinking about the

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.020 
and so you know thinking about the
experience<00:02:14.450> of<00:02:15.020> entering<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:16.010> building<00:02:16.400> is

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
experience of entering the building is

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.870 
experience of entering the building is
what<00:02:17.240> this<00:02:17.360> is<00:02:17.510> all<00:02:17.660> about<00:02:17.690> I<00:02:18.670> honestly<00:02:19.670> feel

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
what this is all about I honestly feel

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.360 
what this is all about I honestly feel
like<00:02:19.940> I<00:02:20.360> always<00:02:21.140> knew<00:02:21.800> I<00:02:21.830> was<00:02:22.010> going<00:02:22.100> to<00:02:22.160> be<00:02:22.280> an

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
like I always knew I was going to be an

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.770 
like I always knew I was going to be an
architect<00:02:24.130> there's<00:02:25.130> kind<00:02:25.400> of<00:02:25.430> a<00:02:25.580> funny<00:02:26.450> story

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
architect there's kind of a funny story

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.860 
architect there's kind of a funny story
of<00:02:26.990> once<00:02:27.830> I<00:02:28.160> found<00:02:28.370> a<00:02:28.550> tape<00:02:28.940> that<00:02:29.630> was<00:02:29.720> in<00:02:29.810> a

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
of once I found a tape that was in a

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.870 
of once I found a tape that was in a
time<00:02:30.080> capsule<00:02:30.260> that<00:02:30.560> said<00:02:30.920> that<00:02:31.520> had<00:02:31.700> me

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
time capsule that said that had me

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.550 
time capsule that said that had me
talking<00:02:32.300> when<00:02:32.450> I<00:02:32.540> was<00:02:32.660> six<00:02:32.900> years<00:02:32.960> old<00:02:33.230> and

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
talking when I was six years old and

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.650 
talking when I was six years old and
said<00:02:34.070> I<00:02:34.190> think<00:02:34.400> I<00:02:34.550> wanted<00:02:34.790> to<00:02:34.850> be<00:02:34.940> an<00:02:35.150> ambulance

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
said I think I wanted to be an ambulance

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.740 
said I think I wanted to be an ambulance
driver<00:02:35.840> or<00:02:36.350> an<00:02:36.740> architect<00:02:37.220> so<00:02:37.460> I<00:02:37.910> think<00:02:38.510> it's

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
driver or an architect so I think it's

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.370 
driver or an architect so I think it's
just<00:02:38.810> kind<00:02:39.020> of<00:02:39.170> in<00:02:39.500> my<00:02:39.770> blood<00:02:40.330> and<00:02:41.330> always<00:02:42.260> kind

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
just kind of in my blood and always kind

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:50.050 
just kind of in my blood and always kind
of<00:02:42.500> a<00:02:42.530> known<00:02:42.680> thing<00:02:48.340> we<00:02:49.340> know<00:02:49.430> that<00:02:49.670> Northern

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
of a known thing we know that Northern

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.910 
of a known thing we know that Northern
Light<00:02:50.240> is<00:02:50.780> a<00:02:50.840> certain<00:02:51.170> type<00:02:51.290> of<00:02:51.440> light<00:02:51.590> and<00:02:51.770> so

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
Light is a certain type of light and so

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.620 
Light is a certain type of light and so
in<00:02:52.040> lights<00:02:52.250> another<00:02:52.490> type<00:02:52.700> of<00:02:52.820> light<00:02:52.970> and<00:02:53.209> that

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
in lights another type of light and that

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.420 
in lights another type of light and that
starts<00:02:53.930> to<00:02:54.020> dictate<00:02:54.170> over<00:02:54.620> Hanks<00:02:55.010> and<00:02:55.160> starts

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
starts to dictate over Hanks and starts

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.710 
starts to dictate over Hanks and starts
to<00:02:55.490> dictate<00:02:55.610> where<00:02:55.940> windows<00:02:56.270> are<00:02:56.450> and<00:02:56.600> where

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
to dictate where windows are and where

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.400 
to dictate where windows are and where
they're<00:02:56.840> solid<00:02:57.290> or<00:02:57.980> there's<00:02:58.160> void<00:02:58.810> and<00:02:59.810> then

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
they're solid or there's void and then

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.980 
they're solid or there's void and then
starting<00:03:00.860> to<00:03:00.890> think<00:03:01.100> about<00:03:01.630> you<00:03:02.630> know<00:03:02.720> the

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
starting to think about you know the

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.230 
starting to think about you know the
environment<00:03:03.260> and<00:03:03.650> how<00:03:03.800> the<00:03:03.830> house<00:03:04.100> can<00:03:04.400> can<00:03:05.060> do

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
environment and how the house can can do

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.430 
environment and how the house can can do
things<00:03:05.480> to<00:03:05.810> be<00:03:05.959> a<00:03:05.990> little<00:03:06.230> bit<00:03:06.320> more

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
things to be a little bit more

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.530 
things to be a little bit more
sustainable<00:03:07.040> for<00:03:07.670> instance<00:03:07.970> this<00:03:08.120> house<00:03:08.300> has

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
sustainable for instance this house has

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.530 
sustainable for instance this house has
you<00:03:08.780> know<00:03:08.900> cisterns<00:03:09.410> and<00:03:09.740> it<00:03:09.950> has<00:03:10.540> solar

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
you know cisterns and it has solar

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.140 
you know cisterns and it has solar
system<00:03:11.959> for<00:03:12.410> photovoltaics<00:03:13.220> for<00:03:13.610> power<00:03:13.790> and

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
system for photovoltaics for power and

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.580 
system for photovoltaics for power and
geothermal<00:03:14.450> and<00:03:14.900> sorry<00:03:15.020> to<00:03:15.140> think<00:03:15.230> about<00:03:15.470> the

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
geothermal and sorry to think about the

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.380 
geothermal and sorry to think about the
placement<00:03:15.800> so<00:03:16.580> it's<00:03:16.730> taking<00:03:17.060> all<00:03:17.180> those

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
placement so it's taking all those

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.070 
placement so it's taking all those
factors<00:03:18.489> and<00:03:19.489> that<00:03:19.700> starts<00:03:20.060> to<00:03:20.120> form<00:03:20.420> the

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
factors and that starts to form the

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.500 
factors and that starts to form the
building<00:03:21.470> and<00:03:21.590> then<00:03:22.250> from<00:03:22.580> there<00:03:22.790> we<00:03:23.209> start<00:03:23.420> to

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
building and then from there we start to

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.490 
building and then from there we start to
talk<00:03:23.660> about<00:03:23.690> materials<00:03:24.530> and<00:03:25.780> and<00:03:26.780> then<00:03:27.320> that

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
talk about materials and and then that

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.170 
talk about materials and and then that
just<00:03:28.070> it's<00:03:28.250> it's<00:03:28.430> really<00:03:28.580> just<00:03:28.670> kind<00:03:28.910> of<00:03:29.030> a

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
just it's it's really just kind of a

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.170 
just it's it's really just kind of a
step-by-step<00:03:29.690> process<00:03:30.080> of<00:03:30.730> zooming<00:03:31.730> in<00:03:31.940> I

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
step-by-step process of zooming in I

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.120 
step-by-step process of zooming in I
like<00:03:32.510> to<00:03:32.630> refer<00:03:32.750> to<00:03:33.050> it<00:03:33.200> as<00:03:33.320> kind<00:03:33.440> of<00:03:33.530> you<00:03:33.739> we

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
like to refer to it as kind of you we

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.979 
like to refer to it as kind of you we
start<00:03:34.370> out<00:03:34.550> you<00:03:34.820> know<00:03:34.940> with<00:03:35.150> a<00:03:35.180> sketch<00:03:35.510> or<00:03:35.780> way

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
start out you know with a sketch or way

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.350 
start out you know with a sketch or way
way<00:03:36.230> out<00:03:36.610> and<00:03:37.610> then<00:03:37.730> you<00:03:37.820> start<00:03:38.000> to<00:03:38.090> talk<00:03:38.239> about

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
way out and then you start to talk about

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.460 
way out and then you start to talk about
floor<00:03:38.660> plans<00:03:38.930> you<00:03:39.050> start<00:03:39.200> to<00:03:39.260> get<00:03:39.320> a<00:03:39.410> little

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
floor plans you start to get a little

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.250 
floor plans you start to get a little
bit<00:03:39.680> closer<00:03:39.890> down<00:03:40.580> to<00:03:40.820> the<00:03:41.330> very<00:03:41.510> end<00:03:41.840> when

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
bit closer down to the very end when

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.860 
bit closer down to the very end when
you're<00:03:42.560> doing<00:03:43.280> details<00:03:43.700> of<00:03:44.030> a<00:03:44.120> baseboard<00:03:44.630> so

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
you're doing details of a baseboard so

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.020 
you're doing details of a baseboard so
you<00:03:45.440> know<00:03:45.680> you<00:03:45.739> start<00:03:46.010> way<00:03:46.190> out<00:03:46.370> here<00:03:46.790> and<00:03:46.880> you

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
you know you start way out here and you

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.970 
you know you start way out here and you
just<00:03:47.150> continue<00:03:47.720> to<00:03:47.900> make<00:03:48.200> progress<00:03:48.440> until<00:03:48.769> you

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
just continue to make progress until you

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.410 
just continue to make progress until you
get<00:03:49.160> to<00:03:49.280> the<00:03:49.370> point<00:03:49.580> where<00:03:49.790> you're<00:03:49.940> zoomed<00:03:50.180> in

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
get to the point where you're zoomed in

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:56.720 
get to the point where you're zoomed in
to<00:03:51.230> a<00:03:51.590> level<00:03:52.040> you<00:03:52.100> can<00:03:52.220> go

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.400 

essentially<00:03:57.730> kind<00:03:58.480> of<00:03:58.540> plays<00:03:58.750> off<00:03:58.780> the<00:03:59.140> curved

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
essentially kind of plays off the curved

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.350 
essentially kind of plays off the curved
theme<00:03:59.710> there's<00:04:00.190> some<00:04:00.340> curved<00:04:00.610> steps<00:04:01.000> in<00:04:01.270> the

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
theme there's some curved steps in the

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.460 
theme there's some curved steps in the
pool<00:04:01.570> the<00:04:02.170> pool<00:04:03.100> has<00:04:03.310> rounded<00:04:03.760> corners<00:04:04.470> to

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
pool the pool has rounded corners to

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.380 
pool the pool has rounded corners to
soften<00:04:05.710> the<00:04:05.920> edges<00:04:06.010> that's<00:04:06.790> what's<00:04:07.120> called<00:04:07.330> a

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
soften the edges that's what's called a

soften the edges that's what's called a
tension<00:04:07.780> edge<00:04:07.900> pool<00:04:08.200> so<00:04:08.890> the<00:04:09.010> water<00:04:09.220> actually

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:09.460 
tension edge pool so the water actually

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.280 
tension edge pool so the water actually
has<00:04:09.640> no<00:04:09.850> curve<00:04:10.120> it<00:04:10.330> goes<00:04:10.510> over<00:04:11.070> and<00:04:12.070> over<00:04:12.640> flows

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
has no curve it goes over and over flows

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.710 
has no curve it goes over and over flows
a<00:04:14.290> night<00:04:15.070> was<00:04:15.670> a<00:04:15.700> pretty<00:04:16.030> neat<00:04:16.180> thing<00:04:16.209> with<00:04:16.630> the

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
pool it's it's designed to mimic a jar

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.960 
pool it's it's designed to mimic a jar
full<00:04:20.019> of<00:04:20.080> fireflies<00:04:20.680> that<00:04:20.709> that<00:04:21.310> sprinkle<00:04:21.760> and

full of fireflies that that sprinkle and
that<00:04:22.180> that<00:04:22.330> sparkles<00:04:22.810> sorry<00:04:23.020> and<00:04:23.320> and<00:04:23.920> has

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
that that sparkles sorry and and has

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.040 
that that sparkles sorry and and has
fiber-optic<00:04:24.940> lights<00:04:25.150> embedded<00:04:25.420> in<00:04:25.660> it<00:04:25.810> and

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
fiber-optic lights embedded in it and

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.840 
fiber-optic lights embedded in it and
they<00:04:26.410> go<00:04:26.530> on<00:04:26.680> and<00:04:26.860> off<00:04:26.950> for<00:04:27.190> this<00:04:27.250> amber<00:04:27.640> color

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
they go on and off for this amber color

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.060 
they go on and off for this amber color
and<00:04:28.120> that's<00:04:28.870> that's<00:04:29.170> also<00:04:29.590> kind<00:04:29.830> of<00:04:29.890> why<00:04:30.010> the

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
and that's that's also kind of why the

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.130 
and that's that's also kind of why the
corners<00:04:30.850> are<00:04:30.970> rounded<00:04:31.090> to<00:04:31.360> mimic<00:04:31.720> that<00:04:31.840> shape

corners are rounded to mimic that shape

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:40.440 
corners are rounded to mimic that shape
of<00:04:32.260> the<00:04:32.350> jar<00:04:36.270> this<00:04:37.270> was<00:04:37.390> a<00:04:37.800> way<00:04:38.800> to<00:04:39.220> make<00:04:39.790> a<00:04:39.820> home

they're in basements without windows and
the<00:04:45.700> reason<00:04:45.970> for<00:04:46.000> that<00:04:46.120> is<00:04:46.330> for<00:04:46.360> sound<00:04:46.750> and<00:04:46.930> for

the reason for that is for sound and for

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.200 
the reason for that is for sound and for
light<00:04:47.290> but<00:04:47.650> in<00:04:47.920> this<00:04:48.280> instance<00:04:48.520> we<00:04:48.880> actually

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
light but in this instance we actually

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.970 
light but in this instance we actually
wanted<00:04:49.480> to<00:04:49.630> make<00:04:49.810> a<00:04:49.840> wall<00:04:50.230> that<00:04:50.470> moved<00:04:50.770> and

wanted to make a wall that moved and

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.230 
wanted to make a wall that moved and
opened<00:04:51.280> it<00:04:51.370> up<00:04:51.520> so<00:04:52.860> for<00:04:53.860> everyday<00:04:54.130> viewing<00:04:54.760> you

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
opened it up so for everyday viewing you

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.490 
opened it up so for everyday viewing you
didn't<00:04:55.420> necessarily<00:04:55.510> have<00:04:55.870> to<00:04:55.990> be<00:04:56.080> in<00:04:56.230> a<00:04:56.290> dark

theater<00:05:24.180> for<00:05:25.180> me<00:05:25.390> the<00:05:26.080> challenge<00:05:26.590> is<00:05:26.800> is<00:05:27.070> is

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
theater for me the challenge is is is

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.620 
theater for me the challenge is is is
truly<00:05:29.100> understanding<00:05:30.100> how<00:05:30.880> to<00:05:31.270> build

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
truly understanding how to build

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.770 
truly understanding how to build
sustainably<00:05:32.490> and<00:05:33.490> as<00:05:33.700> I<00:05:33.850> mentioned<00:05:34.180> earlier<00:05:34.450> I

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
sustainably and as I mentioned earlier I

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.540 
sustainably and as I mentioned earlier I
don't<00:05:35.710> know<00:05:35.800> that<00:05:35.950> I'll<00:05:36.010> ever<00:05:36.130> come<00:05:36.340> up<00:05:36.520> with

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
don't know that I'll ever come up with

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.030 
don't know that I'll ever come up with
that<00:05:36.790> correct<00:05:37.330> answer<00:05:37.570> but<00:05:38.320> right<00:05:38.500> now<00:05:38.710> it<00:05:39.010> is

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.040 
that correct answer but right now it is

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.320 
that correct answer but right now it is
it<00:05:39.490> is<00:05:39.610> a<00:05:39.640> real<00:05:40.000> real<00:05:40.300> issue<00:05:40.510> I<00:05:40.930> think<00:05:42.210> with<00:05:43.210> the

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
it is a real real issue I think with the

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.900 
it is a real real issue I think with the
world<00:05:43.510> and<00:05:43.840> it's<00:05:44.320> something<00:05:44.470> that<00:05:44.890> I<00:05:45.100> really

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910 
world and it's something that I really

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.990 
world and it's something that I really
don't<00:05:46.060> think<00:05:46.560> has<00:05:47.560> been<00:05:47.800> brought<00:05:48.669> to<00:05:48.700> its

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
don't think has been brought to its

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.900 
don't think has been brought to its
fullest<00:05:49.300> attention<00:05:49.750> in<00:05:49.930> the<00:05:50.230> general<00:05:50.530> public

fullest attention in the general public
and<00:05:51.910> and<00:05:52.390> I<00:05:52.630> think<00:05:52.840> that<00:05:53.080> to<00:05:53.710> me

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.410 
and and I think that to me

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.110 
and and I think that to me
whether<00:05:56.410> it's<00:05:56.650> again<00:05:56.950> a<00:05:57.130> very<00:05:57.160> small<00:05:57.700> bathroom

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
whether it's again a very small bathroom

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.430 
whether it's again a very small bathroom
renovation<00:05:58.570> or<00:05:58.810> a<00:05:58.840> huge<00:05:59.140> commercial

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
renovation or a huge commercial

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.670 
renovation or a huge commercial
