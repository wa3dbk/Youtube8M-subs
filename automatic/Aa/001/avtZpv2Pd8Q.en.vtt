00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:31.480
 hi friends again with you for 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:35.320
 teach them a new one a new 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.270
 preparation to cook and fry their 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.329
 food and do some other 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.699
 preparations 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.699
 what I'm going to teach you is called 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:55.780
 in words in Spanish it is called 

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:58.510
 clarified butter I explain what 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.579
 is this clarified butter is 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.479
 a butter that has been 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:08.649
 cooking to separate caffeine from 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:12.039
 serum and we only leave the fat according to 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:14.020
 ayurveda medicine is a food but 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:16.810
 very very good for health because the 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:20.670
 body assimilates it well unlike 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:24.069
 the butter in its normal state 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.630
 because being so the body does not 

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:29.679
 assimilates well if there are people with 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.869
 lactose intolerance because they can not 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:37.150
 eat any type of food that is 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:40.510
 of milk so this 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:44.440
 it's a very easy preparation of 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:46.900
 do also has the advantage that we 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.990
 can last for many months without having to 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.660
 put it in the refrigerator except 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:57.120
 it's very, very, very hot if 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:59.220
 we should not get it 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.080
 you can leave out that is the other 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.760
 advantage unlike butter 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.710
 that butter we always have 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:08.460
 that refrigerate has a date 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:11.130
 certain expiration but the jee and 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:14.550
 we leave it out without any problem 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:17.520
 It is also very resistant to heat 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.850
 can be used to fry personally 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.160
 I do not recommend eating fried foods 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.410
 because they are not very good for health 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.500
 especially the people who want 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:32.310
 maintain the ideal weight I recommend them 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.320
 that do not consume fried things this 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.170
 you can also use smeared bread 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:41.040
 according to ayurveda medicine they say that 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:44.300
 helps improve memory improve the 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.550
 circulation and stomach problems 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.830
 It is also very, very good for the 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.670
 skin can use it as a cream 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.990
 night for the body especially people 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.690
 they have very dry skin with 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.600
 problems of eczema psoriasis because it 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.180
 penetrates and nourishes the skin very well 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.050
 and the only thing that has the smell a bit to 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.420
 the butter but much softer but 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.940
 for that you can take a few drops 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.650
 of essential oils 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.190
 later I will make videos with 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:21.069
 beauty recipes with guide and good I'll 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:23.739
 to teach them now how to prepare 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.840
 as I say it is an easy preparation of 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.769
 do 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:32.489
 it only requires a little bit of 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:32.489
 patience good let's see what we will do 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.670
 I already have the butter on the fire 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:45.010
 they have to put on medium heat 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:46.989
 I'm melting half a kilo more or less 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.880
 well I do not have a brand of 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.010
 Butter 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.110
 but the butter that I buy in the 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.520
 flea market to a grandmother that she 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.740
 prepare 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:00.230
 but preferably I recommend that you 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:02.780
 use in biological butter 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.450
 when the butter is totally 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.400
 melted 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:10.610
 let's stop removing it 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.870
 and we leave 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.870
 the average fire 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:24.319
 when you start making this foam 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:30.680
 white we will remove it delicately 

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:30.680
 without mixing with what we have down 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:38.300
 that's very important because what 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.300
 let's leave is that part 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:47.019
 Yellow can see how 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:49.739
 we begin to see the golden color of the 

00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:49.739
 Butter 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.470
 then this will be done gently 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.890
 without mixing it carefully 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:11.600
 and so we continue to remove all the 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.600
 foam 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.230
 and here you get all the foam but like 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:22.090
 keep watching it continues to give more foam 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:24.660
 within a moment that we have to 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:28.280
 also be careful with the foot 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:31.590
 At this moment we can see the background 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:34.860
 from the pot if they realize this has 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:37.319
 it was very clear 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:40.009
 and in the background you see something like a creampie 

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:40.009
 punch 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.259
 then at this time we can already 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:52.190
 to turn off 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:54.669
 the fire and remove it to let it 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.669
 cool a little 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.710
 now that it has cooled a bit 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:08.080
 As you can see, that's very clear 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:12.540
 totally transparent and now I'm going to 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.540
 strain and in a colander with a fine cloth 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.300
 look what color more beautiful
