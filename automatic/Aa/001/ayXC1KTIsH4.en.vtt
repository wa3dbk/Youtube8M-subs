here and also the frame the stirring
stopper<00:00:14.730> was<00:00:15.089> an<00:00:15.179> issue<00:00:15.350> so<00:00:16.350> we're<00:00:16.529> working<00:00:16.650> on

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
stopper was an issue so we're working on

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.000 
stopper was an issue so we're working on
this<00:00:17.300> now<00:00:18.300> what<00:00:18.510> debating<00:00:18.930> if<00:00:19.109> if<00:00:19.770> we're<00:00:19.920> going

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
this now what debating if if we're going

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.980 
this now what debating if if we're going
to<00:00:20.070> paint<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.369> entire<00:00:20.550> frame<00:00:20.990> touch-ups

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
to paint the entire frame touch-ups

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.250 
to paint the entire frame touch-ups
we're<00:00:22.830> not<00:00:22.920> sure<00:00:23.600> we<00:00:24.600> kind<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:24.960> like<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.140> keep

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
we're not sure we kind of like to keep

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.970 
we're not sure we kind of like to keep
them<00:00:25.529> as<00:00:25.710> original<00:00:26.189> as<00:00:26.310> possible<00:00:27.410> so<00:00:28.410> we'll

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
them as original as possible so we'll

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.540 
them as original as possible so we'll
see<00:00:29.130> what<00:00:29.220> happens<00:00:30.470> the<00:00:31.470> decision<00:00:32.160> was<00:00:32.309> made

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
see what happens the decision was made

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.790 
see what happens the decision was made
to<00:00:32.960> to<00:00:33.960> repaint<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:36.380> can<00:00:37.380> take<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.559> bit<00:00:37.649> more

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
to to repaint it can take a bit more

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.560 
to to repaint it can take a bit more
time<00:00:38.070> but<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.370> think<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.760> overall<00:00:39.059> products

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
time but I think the overall products

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.930 
time but I think the overall products
would<00:00:39.660> be<00:00:39.690> way<00:00:39.930> better<00:00:40.370> because<00:00:41.370> she<00:00:41.610> was<00:00:41.760> way

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
would be way better because she was way

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.819 
would be way better because she was way
too<00:00:42.000> far<00:00:42.329> gone<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.570> think<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.260> would<00:00:43.410> look<00:00:43.620> so

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
too far gone I think it would look so

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.250 
too far gone I think it would look so
bad<00:00:44.040> so<00:00:45.020> so<00:00:46.020> quick<00:00:46.230> priming<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:48.260> painting

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
bad so so quick priming and painting

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.860 
bad so so quick priming and painting
we've<00:00:49.829> been<00:00:49.950> painted<00:00:50.579> black<00:00:50.730> now<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.480> inside

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
we've been painted black now the inside

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.290 
we've been painted black now the inside
got<00:00:52.050> done<00:00:52.230> with<00:00:52.320> Trent<00:00:52.559> glad<00:00:52.969> all<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.210> way

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
got done with Trent glad all the way

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.290 
got done with Trent glad all the way
through<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:55.430> no<00:00:56.430> sense<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.850> repaint<00:00:57.120> or

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
through so no sense to repaint or

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.590 
through so no sense to repaint or
whatever<00:00:57.890> there<00:00:58.890> we<00:00:58.949> go<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.399> frame<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.059> at<00:01:00.449> all

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
whatever there we go the frame is at all

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.299 
whatever there we go the frame is at all
painted<00:01:01.789> dry<00:01:02.789> very<00:01:03.000> very<00:01:03.270> fast<00:01:04.189> which<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.220> a

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
painted dry very very fast which is a

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.359 
painted dry very very fast which is a
good<00:01:05.460> thing<00:01:06.380> that's<00:01:07.380> better<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.740> job<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:08.070> guess

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.810 

what<00:01:11.369> better<00:01:11.610> what<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:11.909> did<00:01:12.030> this<00:01:12.150> morning

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
what better what it did this morning

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.910 
what better what it did this morning
anyway<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.210> again<00:01:15.869> it's<00:01:16.049> only<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.259> bit<00:01:16.439> bike<00:01:16.619> I

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
anyway and again it's only a bit bike I

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.260 
anyway and again it's only a bit bike I
think<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.549> mean<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:17.790> slope<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.270> better<00:01:20.270> put

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
think that mean I slope it better put

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.539 
think that mean I slope it better put
the<00:01:21.479> make<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:21.960> rolling<00:01:22.290> frame<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.830> we're

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
the make it rolling frame and we're

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.880 
the make it rolling frame and we're
going<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.700> go<00:01:23.820> from<00:01:23.939> there<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.650> guess<00:01:25.650> now<00:01:25.830> we

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
going to go from there I guess now we

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.950 
going to go from there I guess now we
have<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.100> rolling<00:01:26.549> frame<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.180> things<00:01:27.780> are

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
have a rolling frame and things are

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.910 
have a rolling frame and things are
moving<00:01:28.140> way<00:01:28.409> faster<00:01:28.439> than<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:29.009> was<00:01:29.100> expected<00:01:30.920> it

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
moving way faster than I was expected it

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.740 
moving way faster than I was expected it
may<00:01:32.070> be<00:01:32.130> an<00:01:32.310> actual<00:01:32.990> one<00:01:33.990> day<00:01:34.200> we<00:01:34.350> built<00:01:34.590> um<00:01:34.829> I

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
may be an actual one day we built um I

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.740 
may be an actual one day we built um I
don't<00:01:36.750> know<00:01:36.840> what<00:01:37.290> we'll<00:01:37.500> see<00:01:37.740> though<00:01:37.920> but

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.600 
don't know what we'll see though but
things<00:01:39.750> are<00:01:39.869> moving<00:01:40.049> fast<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:41.100> this<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.280> quite

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610
