how to start about one year we got the

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.000 
how to start about one year we got the
brilliant<00:00:27.689> oh<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.109> started<00:00:28.410> because<00:00:28.710> we<00:00:28.830> used

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
brilliant oh it started because we used

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.919 
brilliant oh it started because we used
to<00:00:29.099> do<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.310> in<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.460> DMV<00:00:29.820> parking<00:00:30.210> lot<00:00:30.359> or<00:00:30.840> if

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
to do it in the DMV parking lot or if

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.450 
to do it in the DMV parking lot or if
you<00:00:31.019> notice<00:00:31.289> with<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.470> DMV<00:00:31.800> parking<00:00:32.130> lot<00:00:32.250> is

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
you notice with the DMV parking lot is

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.610 
you notice with the DMV parking lot is
immense<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.270> there's<00:00:33.750> not<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:34.170> lot<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.590> mean

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
immense and there's not a lot I mean

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.250 
immense and there's not a lot I mean
there<00:00:34.890> there<00:00:35.219> are<00:00:35.570> there<00:00:36.570> are<00:00:36.600> ya<00:00:36.930> there<00:00:37.110> are

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
there there are there are ya there are

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.160 
there there are there are ya there are
pylons<00:00:37.739> for<00:00:38.100> four<00:00:38.910> lights<00:00:39.180> but<00:00:39.840> they're<00:00:40.020> not

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
pylons for four lights but they're not

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.020 
pylons for four lights but they're not
they're<00:00:40.530> pretty<00:00:40.770> sparse<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:41.640> it's<00:00:41.760> easy

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
they're pretty sparse and so it's easy

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.880 
they're pretty sparse and so it's easy

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
so anyway so we would always like swish

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.120 
so anyway so we would always like swish
it<00:01:23.549> into<00:01:23.790> two<00:01:24.060> wheel<00:01:24.299> drive<00:01:24.500> rear<00:01:25.500> wheel<00:01:25.860> and

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
it into two wheel drive rear wheel and

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.060 
it into two wheel drive rear wheel and
just<00:01:26.420> like<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.930> greens<00:01:28.200> were<00:01:28.350> all<00:01:28.590> covered<00:01:28.979> in

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
just like the greens were all covered in

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.560 
just like the greens were all covered in
stuff<00:01:29.280> with<00:01:29.400> fences<00:01:29.820> whatever<00:01:30.090> once<00:01:30.270> long<00:01:30.450> we

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
stuff with fences whatever once long we

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.120 
stuff with fences whatever once long we
find<00:01:30.840> one<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.110> wasn't<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.619> be<00:01:31.710> completely

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
find one that wasn't and be completely

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.440 
find one that wasn't and be completely
flattened<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.759> that's<00:01:32.939> just<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.240> perfect

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
flattened is that's just a perfect

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.270 
flattened is that's just a perfect
question<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:33.990> know<00:01:34.170> knows<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.710> think<00:01:35.159> about

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
question you know knows it I think about

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.130 
question you know knows it I think about
it<00:01:35.369> now<00:01:35.400> like<00:01:35.700> oh<00:01:35.820> my<00:01:36.090> god<00:01:36.420> we<00:01:36.659> tore<00:01:36.960> those

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
it now like oh my god we tore those

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.740 
it now like oh my god we tore those
green<00:01:37.439> apart<00:01:37.799> anyway<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:39.000> bar<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.630> was

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
green apart anyway so the bar that was

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.580 
green apart anyway so the bar that was
the<00:01:39.869> kicker<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.380> story<00:01:40.439> we<00:01:41.720> sew<00:01:42.720> on<00:01:43.200> the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
the kicker to the story we sew on the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.670 
the kicker to the story we sew on the
other<00:01:43.799> side<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.189> golf<00:01:44.340> course<00:01:44.610> over<00:01:45.180> by

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
I like well I got to get in Reverse try

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.979 
I like well I got to get in Reverse try
to<00:02:41.730> get<00:02:41.880> out<00:02:41.970> here<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:42.450> know<00:02:42.480> tires<00:02:42.780> are

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
to get out here you know tires are

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.559 
to get out here you know tires are
spinning<00:02:43.310> forward<00:02:44.310> tires<00:02:44.790> are<00:02:44.940> spinning<00:02:45.090> we

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
spinning forward tires are spinning we

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.920 
spinning forward tires are spinning we
get<00:02:45.720> out<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:46.080> figure<00:02:46.260> out<00:02:46.380> that<00:02:46.500> that<00:02:47.130> we<00:02:47.930> the

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930

tracks<00:02:49.260> are<00:02:49.470> like<00:02:49.620> this<00:02:49.830> and<00:02:50.069> the<00:02:50.280> car<00:02:50.580> is<00:02:50.850> like

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
tracks are like this and the car is like

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.780 
tracks are like this and the car is like
that<00:02:51.630> no<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.890> tires<00:02:53.130> are<00:02:53.370> stuck<00:02:53.580> in

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
that no and the tires are stuck in

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.900 
that no and the tires are stuck in
between<00:02:53.940> railroad<00:02:54.630> ties<00:02:54.900> and<00:02:55.410> it<00:02:56.190> just<00:02:56.610> snowed
