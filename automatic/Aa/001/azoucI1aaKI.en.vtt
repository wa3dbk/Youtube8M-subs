her<00:00:40.080> horsepower<00:00:40.610> figures<00:00:41.610> but<00:00:41.850> it's<00:00:42.000> probably

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
her horsepower figures but it's probably

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.720 
her horsepower figures but it's probably
about<00:00:42.390> 30<00:00:42.690> over<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.350> regular<00:00:43.770> HL<00:00:44.220> version

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730

about 30 over the regular HL version
which<00:00:45.480> really<00:00:45.960> translates<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.710> great

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
which really translates to great

just<00:01:03.150> a<00:01:03.210> little<00:01:03.329> enhancements<00:01:04.020> like<00:01:04.080> the

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
just a little enhancements like the

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:07.639 
just a little enhancements like the
carpet<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.520> wheel<00:01:06.080> the<00:01:07.080> gelcoat

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:07.649 
carpet the wheel the gelcoat

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:10.160 
carpet the wheel the gelcoat
a<00:01:07.920> lot<00:01:08.190> of<00:01:08.340> really<00:01:08.940> cool<00:01:09.180> little<00:01:09.390> features<00:01:09.840> but

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
a lot of really cool little features but

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.260 
a lot of really cool little features but
my<00:01:10.350> favorite<00:01:10.890> enhancement<00:01:11.550> that<00:01:11.940> is

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
my favorite enhancement that is

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.210 
my favorite enhancement that is
throughout<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.810> whole<00:01:12.960> line<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.350> year<00:01:13.410> is<00:01:14.160> a

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
throughout the whole line this year is a

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.580 
throughout the whole line this year is a
thing<00:01:14.729> called<00:01:15.020> throttle<00:01:16.020> directional

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
thing called throttle directional

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.070 
thing called throttle directional
enhancement<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:18.060> just<00:01:18.210> bump<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.660> up<00:01:18.750> one

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
enhancement and you just bump it up one

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.590 
enhancement and you just bump it up one
detent<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.640> drops<00:01:20.910> the<00:01:21.030> bucket<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.570> little

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
detent and it drops the bucket a little

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.170 
detent and it drops the bucket a little
bit<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.410> this<00:01:22.920> one<00:01:23.100> acts<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.550> kind<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.880> quasi

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
bit and this one acts is kind of a quasi

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.480 
bit and this one acts is kind of a quasi
rudder<00:01:24.690> a<00:01:24.810> little<00:01:25.140> bit<00:01:25.320> but<00:01:25.890> also<00:01:26.040> gives<00:01:26.399> a

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
rudder a little bit but also gives a

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.969 
rudder a little bit but also gives a
little<00:01:26.640> downforce<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:27.720> makes<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.710> really

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
little downforce so makes you really

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.760 
little downforce so makes you really
track<00:01:29.280> smooth<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.970> in<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.929> straight<00:01:31.350> line<00:01:31.560> I

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
track smooth and in a straight line I

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.639 
track smooth and in a straight line I
have<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.130> hard<00:01:32.700> time<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:33.360> know<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.509> drive<00:01:34.170> mostly
