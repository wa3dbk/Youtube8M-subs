University today we're going to talk

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.670 
University today we're going to talk
about<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.910> greenhouse<00:00:21.150> effect<00:00:21.330> how<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:22.439> works

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
about the greenhouse effect how it works

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.380 
about the greenhouse effect how it works
and<00:00:22.920> why<00:00:23.430> it's<00:00:23.640> important<00:00:24.060> for<00:00:24.090> climate

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
and why it's important for climate

and why it's important for climate
change<00:00:25.460> all<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.970> energy<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.599> comes<00:00:28.080> into

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
change all of the energy that comes into

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.880 
change all of the energy that comes into
the<00:00:28.560> earth<00:00:28.710> has<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.340> get<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:29.939> earth<00:00:30.150> by

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
the earth has to get to the earth by

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.220 
the earth has to get to the earth by
electromagnetic<00:00:31.890> radiation<00:00:32.669> there's<00:00:32.910> no<00:00:33.230> air

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
electromagnetic radiation there's no air

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.530 
electromagnetic radiation there's no air
outside<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.399> Earth's<00:00:35.610> atmosphere<00:00:36.300> so

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
outside the Earth's atmosphere so

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.479 
outside the Earth's atmosphere so
there's<00:00:37.110> no<00:00:37.260> way<00:00:37.410> for<00:00:37.620> heat<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.920> get<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.280> and

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
there's no way for heat to get in and

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.920 
there's no way for heat to get in and
out<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.820> earth<00:00:38.969> it's<00:00:39.210> just<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.540> big<00:00:39.719> ball

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
out of the earth it's just a big ball

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.170 
out of the earth it's just a big ball
floating<00:00:40.469> around<00:00:40.559> in<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.950> vacuum<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.030> only

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
floating around in a vacuum so the only

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.000 
floating around in a vacuum so the only
way<00:00:42.390> we<00:00:42.570> can<00:00:42.629> get<00:00:42.750> energy<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.530> energy<00:00:43.559> back

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
way we can get energy in and energy back

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.790 
way we can get energy in and energy back
out<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.520> through<00:00:45.090> electromagnetic<00:00:45.800> radiation

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
out is through electromagnetic radiation

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.209 
out is through electromagnetic radiation
it's<00:00:47.219> actually<00:00:47.789> waves<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.719> energy<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.980> come

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
it's actually waves of energy that come

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.930 
it's actually waves of energy that come
in<00:00:50.430> short<00:00:51.390> waves<00:00:51.629> are<00:00:52.370> visible<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.550> us<00:00:53.670> as

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
in short waves are visible to us as

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.389 
in short waves are visible to us as
light<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:55.020> we<00:00:55.230> can<00:00:55.379> feel<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.860> Sun<00:00:56.070> on<00:00:56.100> us

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
light and and we can feel the Sun on us

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.430 
light and and we can feel the Sun on us
that's<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.789> short<00:00:57.120> waves<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:58.199> long

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
that's the short waves and the long

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.369 
that's the short waves and the long
waves<00:00:58.770> go<00:00:59.039> back<00:00:59.250> out<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.730> long<00:01:00.030> waves<00:01:00.719> carry

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
waves go back out the long waves carry

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.680 
waves go back out the long waves carry
the<00:01:01.559> energy<00:01:01.859> back<00:01:02.039> out<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.460> space<00:01:02.690> radiating

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
the energy back out to space radiating

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.200 
the energy back out to space radiating
energy<00:01:04.019> just<00:01:04.710> like<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:05.070> feel<00:01:05.369> energy<00:01:05.880> coming

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
energy just like you feel energy coming

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.539 
energy just like you feel energy coming
off<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.360> fire<00:01:06.750> or<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.560> feel<00:01:07.799> energy<00:01:08.189> coming<00:01:08.369> off

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
off a fire or you feel energy coming off

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.240 
off a fire or you feel energy coming off
a<00:01:08.610> heat<00:01:08.909> lamp<00:01:09.049> where<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.170> can<00:01:10.350> feel<00:01:10.619> heat

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
a heat lamp where you can feel heat

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.399 
a heat lamp where you can feel heat
energy<00:01:11.460> coming<00:01:11.880> off<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.330> hot<00:01:12.510> stove<00:01:12.869> the

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
energy coming off of a hot stove the

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.530 
energy coming off of a hot stove the
earth<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.860> radiating<00:01:14.610> energy<00:01:14.970> back<00:01:15.150> out<00:01:15.330> to

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
earth is radiating energy back out to

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.859 
earth is radiating energy back out to
space<00:01:15.750> cooling<00:01:16.140> itself<00:01:16.530> off<00:01:16.770> all<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.310> time

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
space cooling itself off all the time

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.810 
space cooling itself off all the time
the<00:01:18.869> energy<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.409> comes<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:19.799> from<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.009> Sun<00:01:20.340> is

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
the energy that comes in from the Sun is

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.090 
the energy that comes in from the Sun is
not<00:01:21.210> enough<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.869> keep<00:01:22.049> us<00:01:22.259> warm<00:01:22.380> here<00:01:22.920> at<00:01:23.009> the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
not enough to keep us warm here at the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.679 
not enough to keep us warm here at the
surface<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.670> earth<00:01:23.729> if<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.390> was<00:01:24.570> the

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
surface of the earth if that was the

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.200 
surface of the earth if that was the
only<00:01:24.840> energy<00:01:25.320> we<00:01:25.470> had<00:01:25.740> believe<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.729> or<00:01:26.850> not<00:01:26.970> the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
only energy we had believe it or not the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.840 
only energy we had believe it or not the
whole<00:01:27.240> earth<00:01:27.810> would<00:01:28.290> actually<00:01:28.710> be<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.460> cold

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
whole earth would actually be so cold

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.700 
whole earth would actually be so cold
that<00:01:30.060> all<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.960> oceans<00:01:31.200> would<00:01:31.650> freeze

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
that all of the oceans would freeze

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.249 
that all of the oceans would freeze
solid<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.939> earth<00:01:33.150> would<00:01:33.420> be<00:01:33.450> just<00:01:33.780> this<00:01:33.869> white

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
solid the earth would be just this white

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.670 
solid the earth would be just this white
ball<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.430> ice<00:01:35.610> floating<00:01:35.939> in<00:01:36.270> space<00:01:36.420> be<00:01:37.170> really

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
ball of ice floating in space be really

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.020 
ball of ice floating in space be really
cold<00:01:37.890> we<00:01:38.070> wouldn't<00:01:38.369> even<00:01:38.460> be<00:01:38.579> here<00:01:38.820> talking

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
cold we wouldn't even be here talking

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.100 
cold we wouldn't even be here talking
about<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.420> because<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.720> wouldn't<00:01:39.930> be<00:01:40.079> a

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
about it because it wouldn't be a

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.170 
about it because it wouldn't be a
habitable<00:01:40.710> planet<00:01:40.860> it's<00:01:41.400> really<00:01:41.820> lucky<00:01:42.150> for

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
habitable planet it's really lucky for

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.410 
habitable planet it's really lucky for
us<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.780> we<00:01:43.259> have<00:01:43.290> air<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:44.759> actually<00:01:44.820> turns

us that we have air it actually turns

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.630 
us that we have air it actually turns
out<00:01:45.570> about<00:01:46.020> two-thirds<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.220> energy<00:01:47.610> that

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
out about two-thirds of the energy that

warms us up at the surface of the earth
is<00:01:49.740> from<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.399> warm<00:01:50.640> air<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.329> also<00:01:51.600> radiates

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
is from the warm air that also radiates

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.139 
is from the warm air that also radiates
these<00:01:52.560> waves<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:53.250> all<00:01:53.369> came<00:01:53.640> from<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.939> Sun

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
these waves it all came from the Sun

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.880 
these waves it all came from the Sun
originally<00:01:54.720> but<00:01:55.079> some<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.439> gets<00:01:55.619> recycled

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
originally but some of it gets recycled

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.740 
originally but some of it gets recycled
it<00:01:56.430> goes<00:01:56.610> up<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:57.060> gets<00:01:57.180> caught<00:01:57.509> by<00:01:57.689> these

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
it goes up it gets caught by these

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.420 
it goes up it gets caught by these
little<00:01:58.079> greenhouse<00:01:58.469> molecules<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.189> sent

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
little greenhouse molecules and sent

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.370 
little greenhouse molecules and sent
back<00:01:59.610> down<00:01:59.909> we<00:02:00.390> call<00:02:00.600> this<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.930> greenhouse

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
back down we call this the greenhouse

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.679 
back down we call this the greenhouse
effect<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:02.369> energy<00:02:02.759> comes<00:02:03.000> in<00:02:03.149> from<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.390> Sun

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
effect the energy comes in from the Sun

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.170 
effect the energy comes in from the Sun
it<00:02:04.140> goes<00:02:04.350> back<00:02:04.649> out<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:05.040> space<00:02:05.159> but<00:02:05.820> some<00:02:06.060> of

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
it goes back out to space but some of

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.479 
it goes back out to space but some of
the<00:02:06.240> energy<00:02:06.600> gets<00:02:06.750> trapped<00:02:07.200> by<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.860> warm<00:02:08.250> air

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
the energy gets trapped by the warm air

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.820 
the energy gets trapped by the warm air
and<00:02:08.780> re-radiated<00:02:09.780> back<00:02:10.080> down<00:02:10.289> like<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.530> bunch

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
and re-radiated back down like a bunch

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.640 
and re-radiated back down like a bunch
of<00:02:10.950> little<00:02:11.099> heat<00:02:11.370> lamps<00:02:11.760> up<00:02:11.910> in<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.120> sky

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.190 

now<00:02:15.370> you<00:02:15.489> may<00:02:15.640> have<00:02:15.670> heard<00:02:15.790> that<00:02:16.299> that<00:02:16.540> the

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
now you may have heard that that the

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:19.659 
greenhouse gas that we hear about a lot

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.949 
greenhouse gas that we hear about a lot
is<00:02:20.110> co2<00:02:20.470> carbon<00:02:21.190> dioxide<00:02:21.569> that's<00:02:22.569> actually

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
is co2 carbon dioxide that's actually

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.440 
is co2 carbon dioxide that's actually
just<00:02:23.110> a<00:02:23.260> small<00:02:23.590> amount<00:02:23.739> of<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.040> air<00:02:24.390> 99%<00:02:25.390> of

the nitrogen and oxygen n2 and o2 but n2

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.020 
the nitrogen and oxygen n2 and o2 but n2
and<00:02:32.440> o2<00:02:32.500> are<00:02:32.799> not<00:02:32.980> very<00:02:33.340> good<00:02:33.610> at<00:02:33.879> absorbing

balls on a spring or tennis balls on a

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.400 
balls on a spring or tennis balls on a
stick<00:02:48.099> these<00:02:48.819> waves<00:02:49.239> of<00:02:49.510> energy<00:02:49.690> can<00:02:50.019> come<00:02:50.230> up

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
stick these waves of energy can come up

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.190 
stick these waves of energy can come up
and<00:02:50.530> hit<00:02:51.069> that<00:02:51.099> ball<00:02:51.940> on<00:02:52.180> a<00:02:52.209> Stick<00:02:52.569> molecule

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
and hit that ball on a Stick molecule

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.860 
and hit that ball on a Stick molecule
and<00:02:53.470> start<00:02:54.099> it<00:02:54.220> vibrating<00:02:54.849> and<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.359> energy<00:02:55.720> is

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
and start it vibrating and the energy is

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.110 
and start it vibrating and the energy is
actually<00:02:56.230> then<00:02:56.410> stored<00:02:56.859> in<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.069> molecule<00:02:57.549> so

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
actually then stored in the molecule so

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.059 
actually then stored in the molecule so
the<00:02:58.269> energy<00:02:58.660> comes<00:02:58.900> up<00:02:59.079> from<00:02:59.349> the<00:02:59.440> earth<00:02:59.590> hits

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
the energy comes up from the earth hits

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:01.470 
the energy comes up from the earth hits
the<00:03:00.250> molecule<00:03:00.640> and<00:03:00.790> it<00:03:00.879> starts<00:03:01.120> vibrating

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
the molecule and it starts vibrating

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.750 
the molecule and it starts vibrating
like<00:03:02.519> but<00:03:03.519> then<00:03:03.730> it<00:03:04.060> can<00:03:04.530> unvarying<00:03:05.549> site<00:03:06.549> and

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
like but then it can unvarying site and

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.300 
like but then it can unvarying site and
send<00:03:07.329> that<00:03:07.510> energy<00:03:07.540> back<00:03:08.170> out<00:03:08.440> to<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.159> earth

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
send that energy back out to the earth

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.580 
send that energy back out to the earth
it<00:03:10.060> could<00:03:10.209> go<00:03:12.060> as<00:03:13.060> it<00:03:13.510> vibrating<00:03:14.049> slower<00:03:14.349> that

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
it could go as it vibrating slower that

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.860 
it could go as it vibrating slower that
energy<00:03:14.950> comes<00:03:15.190> back<00:03:15.400> out<00:03:15.609> but<00:03:16.480> there's<00:03:16.659> not<00:03:16.810> a

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
energy comes back out but there's not a

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.479 
energy comes back out but there's not a
heck<00:03:17.109> of<00:03:17.140> a<00:03:17.319> lot<00:03:17.440> you<00:03:17.620> can<00:03:17.769> do<00:03:17.920> with<00:03:18.069> two<00:03:18.250> balls

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
heck of a lot you can do with two balls

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:19.949 
heck of a lot you can do with two balls
on<00:03:18.669> a<00:03:18.700> stick<00:03:18.970> there's<00:03:19.209> just<00:03:19.450> not<00:03:19.569> that<00:03:19.630> many

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
on a stick there's just not that many

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.800 
on a stick there's just not that many
ways<00:03:20.169> for<00:03:20.380> them<00:03:20.530> to<00:03:20.620> move<00:03:20.970> co2<00:03:21.970> is<00:03:22.299> different

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
ways for them to move co2 is different

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.479 
ways for them to move co2 is different
co2<00:03:23.560> has<00:03:23.950> three<00:03:24.430> atoms<00:03:24.639> so<00:03:25.299> there's<00:03:25.510> a<00:03:26.160> co2<00:03:27.160> and

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
co2 has three atoms so there's a co2 and

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.390 
co2 has three atoms so there's a co2 and
as<00:03:28.150> you<00:03:28.299> can<00:03:28.419> imagine<00:03:28.540> the<00:03:29.019> co2<00:03:29.290> molecule<00:03:29.980> can

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
as you can imagine the co2 molecule can

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.059 
as you can imagine the co2 molecule can
vibrate<00:03:30.639> just<00:03:31.150> like<00:03:31.329> n2<00:03:31.660> or<00:03:31.690> o2<00:03:31.900> if<00:03:32.169> you<00:03:32.260> go<00:03:35.069> but

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
vibrate just like n2 or o2 if you go but

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.039 
vibrate just like n2 or o2 if you go but
it<00:03:36.160> can<00:03:36.280> also<00:03:36.459> do<00:03:36.819> other<00:03:36.970> stuff<00:03:37.299> for<00:03:37.959> example

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
it can also do other stuff for example

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.289 
it can also do other stuff for example
because<00:03:38.829> it's<00:03:39.010> got<00:03:39.190> three<00:03:39.459> atoms<00:03:39.669> it<00:03:40.180> can<00:03:40.389> go

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
because it's got three atoms it can go

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:48.869 
because it's got three atoms it can go
or<00:03:43.299> can<00:03:43.449> go<00:03:45.090> or<00:03:46.090> can<00:03:46.269> go<00:03:47.400> and<00:03:48.400> all<00:03:48.730> these

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 
or can go or can go and all these

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:51.030 
or can go or can go and all these
different<00:03:49.120> kinds<00:03:49.329> of<00:03:49.690> molecular<00:03:50.109> dances<00:03:50.859> that

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
different kinds of molecular dances that

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.710 
different kinds of molecular dances that
the<00:03:51.160> co2<00:03:51.400> molecule<00:03:52.000> can<00:03:52.180> do<00:03:52.269> will<00:03:52.449> absorb

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
the co2 molecule can do will absorb

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.569 
the co2 molecule can do will absorb
different<00:03:52.959> wavelengths<00:03:53.230> of<00:03:53.799> energy<00:03:53.859> so

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
different wavelengths of energy so

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.360 
different wavelengths of energy so
because<00:03:54.910> it<00:03:55.060> has<00:03:55.209> all<00:03:55.449> these<00:03:55.660> different

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
because it has all these different

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.099 
because it has all these different
varieties<00:03:57.370> of<00:03:57.510> dances<00:03:58.510> of<00:03:58.660> varieties<00:03:59.079> of

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
varieties of dances of varieties of

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.259 
varieties of dances of varieties of

vibration that it can do up in the sky
it<00:04:01.629> can<00:04:02.079> absorb<00:04:02.230> much<00:04:02.650> more<00:04:02.919> energy<00:04:03.280> and

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
it can absorb much more energy and

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.189 
it can absorb much more energy and

earth<00:04:05.319> keeping<00:04:05.739> us<00:04:05.859> warm<00:04:06.040> so<00:04:06.760> the<00:04:06.940> co2<00:04:07.209> is<00:04:07.419> a

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:07.449 
earth keeping us warm so the co2 is a

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:09.990 
earth keeping us warm so the co2 is a
much<00:04:07.660> more<00:04:07.840> powerful<00:04:08.079> greenhouse<00:04:08.560> gas<00:04:09.190> than

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
much more powerful greenhouse gas than

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.849 
much more powerful greenhouse gas than
Oh<00:04:10.209> to<00:04:10.269> an<00:04:10.569> end<00:04:10.720> to<00:04:10.840> that<00:04:11.049> make<00:04:11.199> up<00:04:11.349> most<00:04:11.500> of<00:04:11.709> our

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
Oh to an end to that make up most of our

Oh to an end to that make up most of our
air<00:04:12.090> water<00:04:13.090> vapor<00:04:13.449> is<00:04:13.660> another<00:04:13.930> one<00:04:14.139> water

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:14.859 
air water vapor is another one water

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:17.670 
air water vapor is another one water
vapor<00:04:15.220> is<00:04:15.430> h2o<00:04:16.060> so<00:04:16.870> again<00:04:17.139> there's<00:04:17.349> three

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
vapor is h2o so again there's three

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.520 
vapor is h2o so again there's three
atoms<00:04:17.859> and<00:04:18.190> an<00:04:18.250> h2o<00:04:18.930> let's<00:04:19.930> see<00:04:20.079> this<00:04:20.229> can<00:04:20.410> be

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
atoms and an h2o let's see this can be

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.409 
atoms and an h2o let's see this can be
the<00:04:20.650> O<00:04:20.680> this<00:04:21.070> time<00:04:21.340> and<00:04:21.609> here's<00:04:21.970> a<00:04:22.030> couple<00:04:22.210> of

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
the O this time and here's a couple of

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:24.810 
the O this time and here's a couple of
H's<00:04:22.810> but<00:04:23.289> unlike<00:04:23.650> co2<00:04:23.890> they're<00:04:24.280> not<00:04:24.430> all<00:04:24.610> in<00:04:24.640> a

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
H's but unlike co2 they're not all in a

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.490 
H's but unlike co2 they're not all in a
straight<00:04:25.060> line<00:04:25.090> like<00:04:25.270> this<00:04:25.630> they're<00:04:26.050> actually

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
straight line like this they're actually

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.990 
straight line like this they're actually
bent<00:04:26.830> like<00:04:27.070> this

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
bent like this

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.210 
bent like this
so<00:04:28.090> the<00:04:28.270> h2o<00:04:28.810> molecules<00:04:29.350> even<00:04:29.620> better<00:04:29.860> at

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
so the h2o molecules even better at

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.040 
so the h2o molecules even better at
dancing<00:04:30.910> and<00:04:31.060> vibrating<00:04:31.540> than<00:04:31.660> the<00:04:31.810> co2

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
dancing and vibrating than the co2

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.370 
dancing and vibrating than the co2
molecule<00:04:32.530> because<00:04:32.800> it<00:04:33.160> can<00:04:33.400> go<00:04:33.720> like<00:04:34.720> that<00:04:34.990> but

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
molecule because it can go like that but

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.490 
molecule because it can go like that but
it<00:04:35.590> can<00:04:35.650> also<00:04:35.800> go<00:04:36.840> or<00:04:37.840> it<00:04:38.080> can<00:04:38.230> do<00:04:38.320> this

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
it can also go or it can do this

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.590 
it can also go or it can do this
swinging<00:04:38.830> thing<00:04:39.100> it<00:04:39.370> can<00:04:39.610> even<00:04:39.760> do<00:04:39.970> hand

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
swinging thing it can even do hand

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.420 
swinging thing it can even do hand
Springs<00:04:40.930> I'm<00:04:41.320> not<00:04:41.590> going<00:04:41.740> to<00:04:41.800> try<00:04:42.010> that<00:04:42.040> here

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
Springs I'm not going to try that here

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.340 
Springs I'm not going to try that here
that<00:04:42.460> would<00:04:42.700> be<00:04:42.790> kind<00:04:43.000> of<00:04:43.060> dangerous<00:04:43.230> so<00:04:44.230> what

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
that would be kind of dangerous so what

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.510 
that would be kind of dangerous so what
does<00:04:44.440> all<00:04:44.560> this<00:04:44.710> have<00:04:44.890> to<00:04:44.920> do<00:04:45.130> with<00:04:45.160> climate

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
does all this have to do with climate

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.720 
does all this have to do with climate

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
molecular dance sends it back down so

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:06.270 
molecular dance sends it back down so
it's<00:05:04.600> like<00:05:04.810> extra<00:05:05.320> little<00:05:05.500> heat<00:05:05.710> lamps<00:05:06.040> up<00:05:06.160> in

the sky that send energy to the surface
of<00:05:08.560> the<00:05:08.650> earth<00:05:08.910> we've<00:05:09.910> calculated<00:05:10.360> that<00:05:10.690> if

you<00:05:10.990> double<00:05:11.320> the<00:05:11.620> number<00:05:11.890> of<00:05:11.919> co2<00:05:12.370> molecules

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 
you double the number of co2 molecules

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.120 
you double the number of co2 molecules
in<00:05:13.030> the<00:05:13.150> air<00:05:13.330> it's<00:05:13.960> the<00:05:14.140> equal<00:05:14.800> amount<00:05:15.070> of

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
you'd expect that to warm things up when

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.890 
you'd expect that to warm things up when
we<00:05:32.919> say<00:05:33.160> we<00:05:33.310> expect<00:05:33.729> extra<00:05:34.240> co2<00:05:34.510> in<00:05:34.870> the

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
we say we expect extra co2 in the

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.020 
we say we expect extra co2 in the
atmosphere<00:05:35.040> to<00:05:36.040> warm<00:05:36.310> the<00:05:36.490> surface<00:05:36.850> of<00:05:36.940> the

atmosphere to warm the surface of the
earth<00:05:37.060> we're<00:05:37.780> saying<00:05:38.080> adding<00:05:38.800> energy<00:05:38.950> to

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
earth we're saying adding energy to

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.219 
earth we're saying adding energy to
something<00:05:39.550> changes<00:05:40.120> its<00:05:40.270> temperature<00:05:40.330> yeah

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
something changes its temperature yeah

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:42.960 
something changes its temperature yeah
we<00:05:41.380> could<00:05:41.560> argue<00:05:41.860> about<00:05:41.919> how<00:05:42.400> much<00:05:42.669> it<00:05:42.880> will

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
we could argue about how much it will

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.540 
we could argue about how much it will
change<00:05:43.330> or<00:05:43.780> when<00:05:44.229> it's<00:05:44.410> going<00:05:44.590> to<00:05:44.650> change<00:05:44.919> but
