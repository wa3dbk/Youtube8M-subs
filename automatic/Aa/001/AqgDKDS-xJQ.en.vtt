00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909

school wrestling season and in offseason

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.810 
school wrestling season and in offseason
like<00:01:30.210> pongo<00:01:30.689> stuff<00:01:30.990> like<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.170> but<00:01:31.680> on<00:01:32.610> the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
like pongo stuff like that but on the

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.990 
like pongo stuff like that but on the
long-term<00:01:33.090> run<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.780> think<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.909> think<00:01:35.909> like

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
long-term run I think I think like

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.410 
long-term run I think I think like
anytime<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.630> take<00:01:36.810> away<00:01:37.220> like<00:01:38.270> every<00:01:39.270> little

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
anytime you take away like every little

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.330 
anytime you take away like every little
kid<00:01:39.829> to<00:01:40.829> ever<00:01:40.979> step<00:01:41.700> on<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.909> wrestling<00:01:42.360> mat

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
kid to ever step on a wrestling mat

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.099 
kid to ever step on a wrestling mat
and<00:01:43.549> the<00:01:43.789> ultimate<00:01:44.030> goal<00:01:44.420> is<00:01:44.539> the<00:01:44.689> an<00:01:44.750> Olympic

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:45.109 
and the ultimate goal is the an Olympic

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:47.679 
and the ultimate goal is the an Olympic
champion<00:01:45.140> and<00:01:45.770> now<00:01:46.579> I<00:01:46.969> think<00:01:47.359> they<00:01:47.450> kind<00:01:47.600> of

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
champion and now I think they kind of

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.580 
champion and now I think they kind of
like<00:01:47.810> took<00:01:47.990> that<00:01:48.170> away<00:01:48.289> from<00:01:48.439> them<00:01:48.619> so<00:01:50.469> me<00:01:51.469> and

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
like took that away from them so me and

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.200 
like took that away from them so me and
my<00:01:51.649> dad<00:01:51.829> talked<00:01:52.100> about<00:01:52.399> it<00:01:52.520> pretty<00:01:52.759> frequently

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
my dad talked about it pretty frequently

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.169 
my dad talked about it pretty frequently
and<00:01:53.869> I<00:01:54.200> think<00:01:54.500> I<00:01:54.789> personally<00:01:55.789> think<00:01:55.939> though

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
and I think I personally think though

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:58.270 
and I think I personally think though
they'll<00:01:56.869> have<00:01:57.020> it<00:01:57.049> back<00:01:57.319> sooner<00:01:57.590> or<00:01:57.679> later<00:01:57.829> but

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
they'll have it back sooner or later but

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.590 
they'll have it back sooner or later but
right<00:01:58.700> now<00:01:59.659> I'm<00:02:00.380> just<00:02:00.439> got<00:02:00.679> dignity<00:02:00.860> by<00:02:01.250> day

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
right now I'm just got dignity by day

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.760 
right now I'm just got dignity by day
right<00:02:02.600> I<00:02:02.780> mean<00:02:03.200> that's<00:02:03.289> probably<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.679> best

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
right I mean that's probably the best

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.969

it it's kind of hard thinking about like
but

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
but

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.839 
but
I<00:02:53.849> think<00:02:54.629> it's<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:57.720> new<00:02:58.379> you<00:02:59.340> have<00:02:59.459> a<00:02:59.489> dream

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
I think it's the new you have a dream

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.149 
I think it's the new you have a dream
ever<00:03:00.060> since<00:03:00.150> you're<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.510> little<00:03:00.750> kid<00:03:00.959> and<00:03:01.319> then

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
ever since you're a little kid and then

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.059 
ever since you're a little kid and then
now<00:03:02.370> just<00:03:02.819> just<00:03:03.030> because<00:03:03.390> a<00:03:03.750> group<00:03:04.590> of<00:03:04.709> people

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
now just just because a group of people

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.860 
now just just because a group of people
don't<00:03:05.340> think<00:03:05.519> it's<00:03:05.670> right<00:03:05.849> for<00:03:06.180> it<00:03:06.510> to<00:03:06.629> be<00:03:06.780> it

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
don't think it's right for it to be it

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.470 
don't think it's right for it to be it
and<00:03:07.079> the<00:03:08.040> Olympics<00:03:08.430> even<00:03:08.760> though<00:03:08.909> it<00:03:09.209> was<00:03:09.360> the
