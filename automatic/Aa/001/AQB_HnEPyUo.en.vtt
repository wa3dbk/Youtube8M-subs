it's on in the temperature gauge reads

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.890 
it's on in the temperature gauge reads
75<00:02:57.769> that's<00:02:58.010> what<00:02:58.129> the<00:02:58.220> temperature<00:02:58.670> is<00:02:58.900> simple

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
75 that's what the temperature is simple
