00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.460
 hard 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.460
 hard 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.479
 hard 

00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:10.799
 hard 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:14.740
 was Dr 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.360
 Hagen 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:25.569
 Run the sun carries 

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:26.699
 to get more going 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.259
 wrong world come 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.930
 Here in our photo studio we will be another small topic today 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.230
 video tutorials dedicate next to me the times presented with who today 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.929
 for us Monnet has to speak into the microphone Hello birthday 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.240
 we chose a theme today, namely 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.250
 stylish 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.409
 and i want to show one he has and within that one explain 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:55.879
 He was the whole Wiemann 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.370
 in photographs cantons the disturbing light reflections Dr 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.280
 Not so big if he's so good I just do not want that Magna just one thing 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.969
 his but 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.409
 I would like to point out a possibility as we have no reflexes on the premium 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.250
 but not from the beginning 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.230
 Include percent in the field in the bed 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.420
 the sticking point in the fiction 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.430
 is always 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.930
 Dr Minkel, we do not have the giveaway on one thing 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.590
 on a he is on an object on a torso 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.689
 Mr. Surface falls off 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.929
 and at the same angle she falls again falls way exit the 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:31.929
 Oyster or is it reflected that is 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.160
 the angle 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.250
 always taken on one side again 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.860
 And that's just like when you're about to start a miracle sprint again 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.280
 other side with the same angle way and if we have this knowledge then 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.940
 we can do a little thing 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.250
 Percent already in the head calculate because we have the givens one 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.050
 Glasses so slightly arched that the whole thing a bit more 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.890
 makes it more difficult 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.950
 but suppose he'll get a flat surface then we just have to 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.950
 the angle to the camera 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.329
 the cradle of the light source to the camera he continues to gain more and more percent 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:05.700
 Enlarge UN reflection 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.880
 remove the camera from the picture 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.239
 that means we have the squad up here also sees a big one 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.439
 this is almost two feet by a meter 10 or unsuitable 20 by the 50 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:16.850
 Percent a big one 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.219
 Light Borna 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:20.609
 hit from above 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:22.939
 on our model 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:26.510
 the light that reflected from it would be the same 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.249
 Floor and that's fine because St pubs do not back the camera and we have 

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:30.650
 you 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.409
 Perfection not on it, it could also make clear the Amalthea 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:34.570
 there is one more point 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.810
 how we came to remember this angle Roth now that is not much who 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.550
 the light which does not anxiously and unchangeably probes little with itself 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.499
 Just laugh your head 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:43.620
 respectively 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.879
 slowly again 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:45.959
 up 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.870
 lead the kit upwards and we already see Jed more beer with the glasses Dr 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.080
 the upper angle they approach us 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.899
 all the more these light reflections occur only that both high 

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:58.870
 yes you have to go up we have seen 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.139
 now that is 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:02.679
 very close together 

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:06.819
 Finally, and so does not require the spell of almost complete purchase 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.819
 By the way, the work here Nina Blazon plant 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.959
 handmade for talks to the far 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:16.849
 therefore 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:18.419
 tiptop 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:19.960
 to take pictures with 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.919
 that is always pay attention 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.139
 The same light from Geseke forced 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.470
 and then that could easily control them 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.300
 Combe to the setting yes what we on beer belly Aufgebot that is we have 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.739
 yes this light source diesel i was never as head not 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.579
 and that is so big or so wide and so big 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:36.470
 so that we 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.190
 get no waste within the portrait and so no 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.709
 disturbing shadows here to glare shadows 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:43.799
 a few city with that 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.389
 but that they do not get too strong shadows below nose and prodigy 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:50.639
 yes and then there are the remaining Beinlich if they are ringing behind us 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:51.739
 sec 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.530
 Two Right Light Drive Nowadays, the likely - piecemeal 

00:03:55.529 --> 00:03:58.579
 what compared what its completely different 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:00.339
 whole flash earlier 

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:02.430
 all over the length in the know 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.360
 and every spark in pretty nice crisp light 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.050
 that also forms the contours 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.300
 he and that we all already so Lich CW photographs here on the Bend IT with the 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.769
 Aperture of 3 2 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.069
 around 160 shutter speed ISO 100 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.799
 There is no playtime facility for toys around Triebel cameras 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.410
 but did it really for professional cameras and immediately you can measure 

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:26.819
 is and usually hear dazzle at numbers 

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:28.770
 Use percent 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.039
 work here in a minimum and still need three blind woman filter 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:35.710
 on the front of the camera dat si plus together as long as enough light 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.389
 could still focus wonderfully with three banks even when dealing with 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:44.310
 by length of 3 2 relatively little heaviest is with photographs here beside 

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:47.649
 70 200 and that is possible in the long focal lengths around the whole people 

00:04:47.649 --> 00:04:48.790
 of course possible 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.810
 and also to further increase the blur in the course as yet 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:52.759
 to make stronger 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:55.759
 yes there is not a failure that has to take a bit of a picture yes 

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:58.860
 and in the morning 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.960
 and so on 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.200
 the scenery works 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.910
 because 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.509
 serious 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:35.509
 hor 

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:42.759
 serious 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.370
 to 

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:51.089
 to
