question here asked on Locker no met

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.230 
question here asked on Locker no met
what<00:00:07.649> if<00:00:07.919> Apple<00:00:08.670> never<00:00:09.740> existed<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:11.070> I<00:00:11.910> think

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
what if Apple never existed and I think

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.029 
what if Apple never existed and I think
we're<00:00:12.420> let<00:00:13.290> me<00:00:13.530> answer<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:14.160> question

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.039 
we're let me answer the question

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.599 
we're let me answer the question
my<00:00:17.039> dog<00:00:18.020> wicked<00:00:19.020> he's<00:00:19.260> again<00:00:19.800> more<00:00:20.189> of<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.310> Linux

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
my dog wicked he's again more of a Linux

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.550 
my dog wicked he's again more of a Linux
kind<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:20.939> dog<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.539> that's<00:00:21.660> fine<00:00:21.930> you<00:00:22.140> can<00:00:22.350> like

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
kind of dog and that's fine you can like

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.509 
kind of dog and that's fine you can like
Linux<00:00:23.070> in<00:00:23.820> fact<00:00:24.060> if<00:00:24.210> Apple<00:00:24.600> never<00:00:24.779> existed

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:25.519 
Linux in fact if Apple never existed

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.130 
Linux in fact if Apple never existed
Linux<00:00:26.519> would<00:00:26.820> probably<00:00:27.300> have<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.510> better<00:00:27.990> shot

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
Linux would probably have a better shot

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.939 
Linux would probably have a better shot
at<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:29.369> know<00:00:29.510> being<00:00:30.510> everywhere<00:00:31.230> actually<00:00:31.439> I

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
at you know being everywhere actually I

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.440 
at you know being everywhere actually I
can't<00:00:32.369> really<00:00:32.489> back<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:33.030> up<00:00:33.180> so<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.390> don't

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
can't really back that up so I don't

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.889 
can't really back that up so I don't
think<00:00:33.739> Linux<00:00:34.739> would<00:00:34.950> get<00:00:35.430> much<00:00:35.670> further<00:00:36.030> than

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
think Linux would get much further than

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.750 
think Linux would get much further than
it<00:00:37.290> than<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.559> is<00:00:37.649> at<00:00:37.950> this<00:00:38.129> point<00:00:38.370> even<00:00:38.579> if

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
it than it is at this point even if

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.400 
it than it is at this point even if
Apple<00:00:39.059> never<00:00:39.180> existed<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:40.020> mean<00:00:40.200> it's<00:00:40.350> an

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
Apple never existed I mean it's an

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.280 
Apple never existed I mean it's an
alternative<00:00:41.160> that's<00:00:42.059> fine<00:00:42.390> for<00:00:42.870> some<00:00:43.079> it's

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
alternative that's fine for some it's

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.500 
alternative that's fine for some it's
the<00:00:43.379> primary<00:00:43.860> choice<00:00:44.450> not<00:00:45.450> for<00:00:45.750> everybody<00:00:47.510> if

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
the primary choice not for everybody if

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.410 
the primary choice not for everybody if
Apple<00:00:49.020> never<00:00:49.230> existed<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:50.579> would<00:00:50.879> say<00:00:51.270> the

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
Apple never existed I would say the

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.750 
Apple never existed I would say the
world<00:00:51.629> would<00:00:51.809> be<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.930> very<00:00:52.309> very<00:00:53.930> sad<00:00:54.930> place<00:00:55.199> and

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
world would be a very very sad place and

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.180 
world would be a very very sad place and
just<00:00:56.760> think<00:00:57.000> about<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.530> at<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.829> point<00:00:59.100> in

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
just think about that at this point in

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.630 
just think about that at this point in
time<00:01:00.890> when<00:01:01.890> you're<00:01:02.070> thinking<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.550> a

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
time when you're thinking of a

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.179 
time when you're thinking of a
smartphone<00:01:02.989> for<00:01:03.989> most<00:01:04.170> people<00:01:04.589> it's<00:01:05.070> the

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
smartphone for most people it's the

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.240 
smartphone for most people it's the
iPhone<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.909> everything<00:01:06.630> else<00:01:07.010> when<00:01:08.010> you're

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
iPhone and everything else when you're

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.000 
iPhone and everything else when you're
thinking<00:01:08.760> about<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.270> tablet<00:01:09.830> computer

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
thinking about a tablet computer

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.090 
thinking about a tablet computer
it's<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.430> iPad<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.180> everything<00:01:12.900> else<00:01:13.100> when

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
it's the iPad and everything else when

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.719 
it's the iPad and everything else when
you're<00:01:14.250> thinking<00:01:14.580> about<00:01:14.790> an<00:01:15.180> mp3<00:01:15.960> player<00:01:16.729> it's

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
you're thinking about an mp3 player it's

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.649 
you're thinking about an mp3 player it's
an<00:01:17.880> iPod<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.630> everything<00:01:19.470> else<00:01:23.360> strong<00:01:24.360> brand

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
an iPod and everything else strong brand

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:25.160 
an iPod and everything else strong brand
right

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
right

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.469 
right
but<00:01:25.950> if<00:01:26.130> Apple<00:01:26.549> wasn't<00:01:26.729> around<00:01:27.000> make<00:01:27.360> no

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
but if Apple wasn't around make no

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.410 
but if Apple wasn't around make no
mistake<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.320> would<00:01:28.740> hope<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:30.090> another

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
mistake I I would hope that another

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.149 
mistake I I would hope that another
company<00:01:31.070> would<00:01:32.070> have<00:01:32.640> established<00:01:33.060> itself

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
company would have established itself

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.219 
company would have established itself
some<00:01:35.159> other<00:01:35.340> platform<00:01:35.880> potentially<00:01:36.689> we<00:01:37.049> may

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
some other platform potentially we may

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.429 
some other platform potentially we may
you<00:01:38.040> know<00:01:38.159> had<00:01:38.460> still<00:01:38.939> been<00:01:38.970> at<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.079> point<00:01:40.290> in

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
you know had still been at this point in

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.920 
you know had still been at this point in
time<00:01:40.560> many<00:01:40.920> Dark<00:01:41.520> Ages<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:42.240> would<00:01:42.360> be<00:01:42.509> the

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
time many Dark Ages that would be the

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.620 
time many Dark Ages that would be the
world<00:01:43.110> before<00:01:43.500> something<00:01:44.340> like<00:01:44.850> Mac<00:01:45.299> OS<00:01:45.600> 10

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
world before something like Mac OS 10

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.770 
world before something like Mac OS 10
was<00:01:46.530> around<00:01:46.909> and<00:01:47.909> I'm<00:01:48.000> not<00:01:48.060> saying<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:48.420> Linux

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
was around and I'm not saying that Linux

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.889 
was around and I'm not saying that Linux
again<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.860> argue<00:01:50.490> with<00:01:50.520> my<00:01:50.729> dog<00:01:50.970> I<00:01:51.390> do<00:01:51.659> that

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
again and argue with my dog I do that

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.749 
again and argue with my dog I do that
frequently<00:01:52.170> enough<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.920> don't<00:01:52.979> need<00:01:53.189> any<00:01:53.579> more

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
frequently enough I don't need any more

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.380 
frequently enough I don't need any more
proof<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:55.640> don't<00:01:56.640> think<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.030> Linux

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
proof of that I don't think that Linux

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.999 
proof of that I don't think that Linux
would<00:01:57.689> have<00:01:57.810> accelerated<00:01:58.079> anymore<00:01:58.710> because

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
would have accelerated anymore because

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.590 
would have accelerated anymore because
Apple<00:01:59.310> existed<00:01:59.670> in<00:01:59.850> fact<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.149> would<00:02:00.270> say<00:02:00.390> Linux

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
Apple existed in fact I would say Linux

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.840 
Apple existed in fact I would say Linux
would<00:02:00.810> actually<00:02:01.140> have<00:02:01.229> been<00:02:01.350> hurt<00:02:01.649> if<00:02:02.399> Apple

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
would actually have been hurt if Apple

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.399 
would actually have been hurt if Apple
didn't<00:02:03.060> exist<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.450> would<00:02:03.630> argue<00:02:04.170> that

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
didn't exist I would argue that

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.649 
didn't exist I would argue that
Microsoft<00:02:05.340> would<00:02:05.670> have<00:02:05.790> been<00:02:05.909> hurt<00:02:06.149> if<00:02:06.329> Apple

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
Microsoft would have been hurt if Apple

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.440 
Microsoft would have been hurt if Apple
didn't<00:02:06.899> exist<00:02:07.200> so<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.530> think<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.799> world<00:02:08.450> would

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
didn't exist so I think the world would

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.449 
didn't exist so I think the world would
be<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.599> much<00:02:10.500> more

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
be a much more

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.210 
be a much more
pathetic<00:02:12.150> place<00:02:12.420> for<00:02:12.810> consumer<00:02:13.290> electronics

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
pathetic place for consumer electronics

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.199 
pathetic place for consumer electronics
if<00:02:14.400> Apple<00:02:15.269> didn't<00:02:15.780> exist<00:02:16.110> but<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:17.280> would<00:02:18.060> say

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
if Apple didn't exist but I would say

a world without some kind of Commodore

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:29.059 
a world without some kind of Commodore
product<00:04:25.979> whether<00:04:26.639> it<00:04:26.759> would<00:04:26.849> be<00:04:26.879> a<00:04:26.970> c64<00:04:28.069> vic-20

a Commodore 128 or beyond the Amiga

really go anywhere which is kind of sad
either<00:04:41.400> way<00:04:41.729> you<00:04:42.659> know<00:04:42.780> I<00:04:42.810> think<00:04:43.139> that<00:04:43.860> the

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:44.849 
either way you know I think that the

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:48.680 
either way you know I think that the
world<00:04:45.349> would<00:04:46.349> be<00:04:46.379> far<00:04:47.039> worse<00:04:47.069> off<00:04:47.690> without

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
world would be far worse off without

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.860 
world would be far worse off without
either<00:04:49.280> Microsoft<00:04:50.280> or<00:04:51.180> Apple<00:04:51.240> so<00:04:51.780> I'm

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
either Microsoft or Apple so I'm

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.950 
either Microsoft or Apple so I'm
changing<00:04:52.289> the<00:04:53.069> question<00:04:53.490> a<00:04:53.759> bit<00:04:54.240> because<00:04:54.810> I

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
changing the question a bit because I

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.809 
changing the question a bit because I
don't<00:04:55.020> want<00:04:55.259> to<00:04:55.349> I'm<00:04:56.069> not<00:04:56.220> trying<00:04:56.430> to<00:04:56.550> say<00:04:56.789> that

00:04:56.809 --> 00:04:56.819 
don't want to I'm not trying to say that

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:58.399 
don't want to I'm not trying to say that
I'm<00:04:57.120> more<00:04:57.300> on<00:04:57.419> the<00:04:57.509> side<00:04:57.659> of<00:04:57.690> Apple<00:04:58.020> or<00:04:58.110> more<00:04:58.289> on

00:04:58.399 --> 00:04:58.409 
I'm more on the side of Apple or more on

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:01.399 
I'm more on the side of Apple or more on
the<00:04:58.530> side<00:04:58.710> of<00:04:59.270> company<00:05:00.270> that<00:05:00.419> is<00:05:00.539> an<00:05:00.659> apple<00:05:00.960> I

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:01.409 
the side of company that is an apple I

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:03.980 
the side of company that is an apple I
think<00:05:02.159> we<00:05:02.220> have<00:05:02.340> to<00:05:02.460> look<00:05:02.610> at<00:05:02.990> every

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
think we have to look at every

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.100 
think we have to look at every
particular<00:05:04.770> effort<00:05:05.610> that's<00:05:05.789> made<00:05:06.150> in<00:05:06.509> this

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
particular effort that's made in this

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.040 
particular effort that's made in this
marketplace<00:05:08.009> of<00:05:08.460> ideas<00:05:08.729> and<00:05:09.419> products<00:05:09.930> and

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
marketplace of ideas and products and

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.249 
marketplace of ideas and products and
services<00:05:10.229> as<00:05:10.699> something<00:05:11.699> which<00:05:12.270> pushes<00:05:13.139> us

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:13.259 
services as something which pushes us

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:15.379 
services as something which pushes us
all<00:05:13.440> forward<00:05:13.740> and<00:05:14.099> I<00:05:14.159> think<00:05:14.520> that<00:05:14.729> without

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
all forward and I think that without

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:18.290 
all forward and I think that without
Apple<00:05:16.139> as<00:05:16.400> originally<00:05:17.400> asked<00:05:17.699> I<00:05:17.819> think<00:05:18.180> we'd

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
Apple as originally asked I think we'd

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.300 
Apple as originally asked I think we'd
be<00:05:18.389> a<00:05:18.419> lot<00:05:18.629> further<00:05:18.690> behind<00:05:19.139> and<00:05:19.560> certainly

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
be a lot further behind and certainly

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.360 
be a lot further behind and certainly
without<00:05:20.490> Microsoft<00:05:21.210> we<00:05:21.389> really<00:05:22.020> really<00:05:22.979> be

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
without Microsoft we really really be

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.999 
without Microsoft we really really be
further<00:05:23.639> behind<00:05:24.110> to<00:05:25.110> the<00:05:25.199> point<00:05:25.440> where<00:05:25.590> Apple

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:26.009 
further behind to the point where Apple

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:28.430 
further behind to the point where Apple
may<00:05:26.610> have<00:05:26.729> taken<00:05:26.909> off<00:05:27.150> further<00:05:27.630> because<00:05:28.349> if

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
may have taken off further because if

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.200 
may have taken off further because if
Microsoft<00:05:28.680> didn't<00:05:29.190> exist<00:05:29.490> but<00:05:29.849> that<00:05:30.030> would

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
Microsoft didn't exist but that would

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.820 
Microsoft didn't exist but that would
not<00:05:30.360> have<00:05:30.569> necessarily<00:05:30.719> made<00:05:31.289> the<00:05:31.469> world<00:05:31.650> a

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
not have necessarily made the world a

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.580 
not have necessarily made the world a
better<00:05:31.979> place<00:05:32.840> we<00:05:33.840> are<00:05:33.960> a<00:05:34.110> better<00:05:34.349> place

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
better place we are a better place

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.080 
better place we are a better place
