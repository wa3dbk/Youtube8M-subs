we're in business 40 years and a lot of

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.700 
we're in business 40 years and a lot of
people<00:05:22.510> said<00:05:22.780> we<00:05:22.960> didn't<00:05:23.230> know<00:05:23.290> you<00:05:23.350> did

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710

facials we didn't know you did massage

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.530 
facials we didn't know you did massage
so<00:05:26.830> you<00:05:27.310> know<00:05:27.490> you'd<00:05:27.820> think<00:05:27.850> that<00:05:28.390> you

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.540 
so you know you'd think that you

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
know what you do but they don't so I

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.200 
know what you do but they don't so I
really<00:05:32.320> learned<00:05:32.530> quite<00:05:33.160> a<00:05:33.220> good<00:05:33.460> lesson<00:05:33.670> and

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
the one thing I did learn is you have to

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.070 
the one thing I did learn is you have to
be<00:05:36.640> willing<00:05:36.820> to<00:05:37.060> change<00:05:37.360> and<00:05:37.660> take<00:05:37.810> chances

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
be willing to change and take chances

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.500 
be willing to change and take chances
and<00:05:38.680> it's<00:05:38.860> been<00:05:39.070> great<00:05:39.280> it's<00:05:39.880> all<00:05:40.030> about<00:05:40.300> the

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.500 
people love events they really trust us
and<00:05:44.920> I<00:05:45.040> think<00:05:45.310> a<00:05:45.400> lot<00:05:45.550> of<00:05:45.580> the<00:05:45.790> estheticians

and I think a lot of the estheticians

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.270 
and I think a lot of the estheticians
and<00:05:46.720> the<00:05:46.840> hairdresser's<00:05:47.440> really<00:05:48.040> don't

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
and the hairdresser's really don't

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.370 
and the hairdresser's really don't
always<00:05:48.370> value<00:05:48.730> that<00:05:49.270> but<00:05:49.540> the<00:05:49.630> customers<00:05:50.200> do

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
always value that but the customers do

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.890 
always value that but the customers do
so<00:05:50.740> the<00:05:50.950> clients<00:05:51.400> today<00:05:51.550> they<00:05:52.240> love<00:05:52.540> to<00:05:52.690> come
