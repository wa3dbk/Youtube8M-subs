closer<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.229> your<00:01:40.380> opponent<00:01:40.740> before<00:01:40.799> actually

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
closer to your opponent before actually

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.469 
closer to your opponent before actually
throwing<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.670> almost<00:01:41.820> like<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.030> half<00:01:42.240> punch

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
throwing it almost like a half punch

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.340 
throwing it almost like a half punch
there's<00:01:42.659> not<00:01:42.750> going<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.930> be<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.020> lot<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.200> power

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
there's not going to be a lot of power

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.109 
there's not going to be a lot of power
in<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.619> but<00:01:44.009> if<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.159> can<00:01:44.280> get<00:01:44.369> my<00:01:44.520> glove<00:01:44.880> this

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
in it but if I can get my glove this

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.850 
in it but if I can get my glove this
