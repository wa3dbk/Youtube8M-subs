00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.010
 the eyes 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:17.000
 tells crowd beauty're talking about the 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.770
 x pedrinho br 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.590
 I did not like an angry gameplay 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.590
 comment from black ops 2 mag play this 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.240
 More special than that, let's say so. 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:29.029
 because it is already a nuclear power and achieve 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.789
 get nothing lc 2 maps down with the 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.699
 lc gun also in the psyche because in 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.090
 Portuguese if I'm not mistaken I miss 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:37.730
 peacemaker 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.130
 I already managed to get nuclear from her. I got it. 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.980
 I got home I played a match in the 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.750
 I drove there and got there. 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.870
 close to nuclear power and ended up dying 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.840
 for water and I played after a map 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.969
 mireide that the match ended up falling on the 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.620
 at the beginning and in mine we will say second 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.300
 at the time the second half did not 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.070
 He told this then my third but 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.920
 counts as if it were the second route 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.680
 to get nuclear is with the psyche 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.050
 Peréa did not even know where she was going 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.990
 map had never played on this map and I 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.820
 I did not see much of a multiplex video 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.979
 idea map and accept such of many 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.200
 of the men but of the multiplayer online I 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.240
 I did not see much then I kind of did not know 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.850
 where I was doing what I do not 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.040
 I knew how to move I was getting 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.990
 on the base of the enemies at 65 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.360
 I found this principal to be more 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.759
 that's where I 've already got a versatile 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.439
 home town and knows nuclear there that I 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.570
 I caught 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:35.090
 They already told me but I do not know if it is 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:39.740
 I do not know the first nuclear martial 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.869
 and here I think it 's for the 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.740
 less the first Brazilian nuclear and 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.649
 df 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.470
 in ps3 wii xbox and not only does a month 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.590
 so speaking of the ps3 that launched today, right? 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.439
 I believe it is the first nuclear and 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:57.439
 one of the new maps but I think lc 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:59.689
 of the world and such of the ps3 I think that with 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.090
 Certainty must have already taken for sure 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.340
 had already a lot of gringo there wanted game 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.200
 much already in the lc already must have turned to the 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.939
 night arriving in lc and such 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.310
 so I do not think I was the first 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:13.280
 world and such but I think I was the 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.980
 first from brazil to catch then i hope 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.959
 that you give a favorite like is fragile 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.580
 When I ask everyone , I think 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.790
 that will give a good publicity this 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.409
 video such is the psyche by many people me 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.040
 he asked in advance what I think and 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:27.980
 such 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.810
 I thought it was very good, as I said it is me 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.019
 I knew she was going to be very good. 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.030
 rift assault rif with is a 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:40.040
 about China so I found her a lot 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:42.560
 Good, it 's very close, it's very good, there's a fire. 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.360
 hit very high then you can kill 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.459
 very well, never again if we have a 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.810
 laser that I was using if I can 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.510
 kill very well 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.860
 is maybe nei also made mec for 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.680
 load faster I think the best 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.109
 thing it would be the former wing clip 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.780
 because her mission ends very fast 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:02.180
 very fast then I recommend they say 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.670
 This is what's in the clip is for a 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.620
 ammunition I think from 30 to 45 years and still 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.040
 I will not release 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.079
 but I really liked this team and how 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.900
 I talked to her up close and very good and 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:17.150
 away she of course is not a lucky riff 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.549
 it is still one of the china on gum 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.380
 but it was better than any other 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:25.700
 even because it has a 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:27.500
 very low recall and she does not like me 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.930
 have a very low risk and can 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.239
 kill from afar and she even stronger 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.160
 far from any other shine movie 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.069
 so I really enjoyed playing with her 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.019
 Of course I played only three games with her. 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.900
 so I do not know if it was three I gave 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.519
 Good luck, but yes, people soon. 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.560
 I'll take nuclear whatever I gave. 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:48.169
 pretty lucky in the end that 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.819
 I ended up being trapped and did not know 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:51.859
 Where were you going because as I said no 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.569
 know a lot of map does not know where they 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:55.730
 They will give the Spanish I knew I had 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.130
 This ladder and I saw on the map that this 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.500
 I was on the main menu then I know 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.450
 I played up to 4m from the sea ​​and 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.250
 pick up a kilt a friend who was 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.930
 died I knew there was someone already 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.359
 I managed to catch the site at least the 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.160
 a very good help I was admiring there 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:11.930
 to get those two who were there 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.599
 I got another one, you 'll still be able to 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.400
 kill him then I 'm missing I think a 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:19.010
 here is the cancer plan task that 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.609
 reached from there they shoot business of this 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.739
 law 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.539
 she 's giving a pretty hit mark more 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.419
 I still think it's worth it 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:27.380
 leave her but as I said three matches only 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.040
 I do not know if it was 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.770
 of these three matches the game 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.480
 Mental is more a boy, I'm going to kill this one. 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.010
 Then I'm going to get nuclear if we go 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.380
 I hope you enjoyed it. 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.120
 the vitz liked not forget disliked 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.920
 a favorite and to help in the 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.720
 and is expected to be the next 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.720
 video and go read it
