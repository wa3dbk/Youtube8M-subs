00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello to all of you guys this video 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.500
 tutorial today I want you to see how 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:12.480
 open the modem router ports 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:15.450
 technicolor tg5 182 n of fastweb for 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.720
 the xbox one to solve some 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.820
 connectivity problem in Greece and 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.570
 away saying 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.550
 so let's start right away with you 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.189
 see how the doors open 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.990
 remember that you must first log in 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.890
 obviously on the page of your modem 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.870
 router 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.530
 if you are not capable you do not know how 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:41.700
 do go to start write here on 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.730
 search bar command cmd give me my 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:50.309
 the dos window will open in which 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:53.100
 we will write ip config we will send and send 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.809
 this data that comes out is gone 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.840
 to extrapolate what is the gateway 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.570
 default then this number here and 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.170
 go back to it in the toolbar 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:07.049
 addresses to be able to access precisely 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.780
 to your router cracker page e 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:13.130
 we will close the page of stored dos 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.619
 I recommend the number that will be for me 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.820
 192.168.1.1 4 for you it could be 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.890
 different but not important 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.950
 the important to access the page of the 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.110
 router will open precisely the 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.000
 by sending your page will open 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.979
 of the router 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.869
 I hate the connection that does not go well 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:38.140
 fast for which I ask comes from this 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:41.679
 window that the home page of yours 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.299
 technicolor we're going to see how to open 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:45.520
 precisely these doors for now 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:48.159
 start by making sure by clicking on 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.710
 Broadband connection to have the 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.710
 modality 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.090
 sorry about toolbox 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.150
 check that you have the game mode 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.340
 activated click on share game 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.810
 applications and down here where it is 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.270
 written choose an activity go up 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.430
 game mode and make sure that up 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.930
 status there is written enabled in the case 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.489
 so it would not be enough to click this 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.080
 rate below which for me is 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.690
 disabled because I am enabled for 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.410
 you are disabled it will be written 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.620
 skill click it and go back up 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.290
 game sharing applications 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.670
 make sure you have np and wolves 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.640
 in extended activation with yes a 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.209
 side if it had not gone up 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.300
 configure and tick these two 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:35.610
 squares with the flag and fate apply to 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.070
 at this point we are going to open ours 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.330
 doors in which way 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.940
 in this way where it is written 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.519
 choose an activity all you do is 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.080
 or create or modify an application 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.090
 because I tell you to create or modify 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.540
 because there are some people who have 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.580
 both from xbox one and xbox 360 and so 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.030
 they will have to create a new one for whom 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.489
 instead it has only the xbox one will make modification 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.530
 a game an application in this way 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:05.160
 in the window you go to open 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:08.160
 we will go here where there is written xbox live e 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.239
 we will change at this time I do not 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:15.780
 I can do it because I already have it 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:19.230
 let's say busy on my xbox then 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:23.159
 wait until I go to remove it like this 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.540
 at least we do so we do removes 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:36.599
 assignment 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:40.010
 ok now we go we're up to 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.010
 return that I'll show you 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.400
 ok let's change a game 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.069
 the app we said let's go on 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.470
 xbox live and here we make changes here 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:55.319
 as you can see there are more doors you will have 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.930
 only these three sects do not do 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.959
 other than adding the doors you see 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.849
 written here by me like this 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.970
 here where there is to choose says more dp 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:09.209
 puts tcp network and these items you see 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.220
 which you will write here and here 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.500
 this does not write to us any net 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.959
 voice remember the farr adds I do to you 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:21.979
 see for example put tcp the first 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:26.520
 at the top and 80 do tcp 80 tcp at 80 and tcp 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:29.250
 80 and you are going to click add so me 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.800
 obviously I ca n't add why 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.510
 it's already there so I won't add it 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.599
 but it makes me reach it without problems 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.460
 and you will come to have this screen 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:39.990
 remember that these parameters that 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.150
 see above are the parameters that 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.440
 allow you in gameplay 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.810
 these are the parameters that there are 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.039
 allow you to have few problems with 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.229
 the chat 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:51.630
 done that you do nothing but go 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:53.370
 ad assign a game is an application a 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.669
 local network device you see 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:05:00.360
 here at this point you find yourself again 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:02.610
 on the famous starting screen here 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:06.210
 you will go to choose xbox live 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.800
 here you will go to choose xbox one not 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:12.150
 you will do nothing but add 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.889
 and here you have added yours 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.790
 let's say your port mapping 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:18.970
 to your xbox 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:20.550
 once you open the xbox it 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.920
 you will see 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:26.950
 remember that if you should give me 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.990
 some kind of problem is not 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.660
 possible up here one would come up 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.600
 written you can not assign 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.310
 I address them to these minister 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.290
 out of these types of errors 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.380
 remember to check that 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:43.660
 the problem was not the dmz in that 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.910
 meaning now I'll show you if you 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.260
 come back up here sharing games 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.360
 applications see what is written 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.620
 configure a device as dmz 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.620
 connected to the LAN network 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:58.360
 make sure this one is there 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:00.160
 written ability means that it is 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.350
 disabled in this case heaven 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.810
 enabled because I have the dmz enabled on the 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:08.560
 portable but in case you had 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:10.870
 only the connection with the xbox one e 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.450
 here was the ip address from yours 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:17.380
 xbox one you have to disable it for a 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:20.050
 simple reason why the dmz alla 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.860
 functionality of the opening of the 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.080
 doors 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.700
 a little less precise than this 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.670
 it is nothing more than a bypass of the firewall 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:29.290
 for which this is activated and you want 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.990
 opening the doors tells you it is not 

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:34.210
 possible because they conflict so 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.100
 this you disable it and open the doors 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.990
 as I showed him 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.940
 otherwise if you don't want to open the doors 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.700
 and it does not create address problems 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.920
 peter edo you can also just enable the 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.250
 DMZ putting what your ip address 

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:51.880
 writing and clicking on skills 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:53.380
 this to make you open the doors and to 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.980
 just solve a little bit of gods 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:58.060
 problems if you have problems if there 

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:01.040
 they are questions 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:03.680
 I hope I was clear 

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.720
 you can very well write me as at 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:09.100
 I usually reply to you in the description 

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:12.230
 as soon as possible if you have any doubts 

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:14.000
 if you have any request of 

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:16.190
 some other routers that you don't know how to 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.080
 enable the doors by saying 

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:20.420
 ask me also that in the limit of mine 

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:23.090
 I can give you a hand and maybe you 

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:26.060
 also creates a tutorial is good for the 

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:28.960
 moment I greet you bye bye and baby 

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.960
 next bye bye
