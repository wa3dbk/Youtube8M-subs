00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
sure you'd better but the clarifying i

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.940 
sure you'd better but the clarifying i
really<00:03:25.330> think<00:03:25.480> that<00:03:25.690> just<00:03:26.380> a<00:03:26.470> little<00:03:26.680> bit<00:03:26.830> and

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
really think that just a little bit and

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.040 
really think that just a little bit and
sold<00:03:27.160> in<00:03:27.250> the<00:03:27.340> water<00:03:27.550> I<00:03:27.880> really<00:03:28.690> think<00:03:28.870> that

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
sold in the water I really think that

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.750 
sold in the water I really think that
helped<00:03:29.350> a<00:03:29.470> lot<00:03:29.620> because<00:03:29.980> my<00:03:30.310> hair<00:03:30.520> was<00:03:30.550> like

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
helped a lot because my hair was like

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.990 
helped a lot because my hair was like
really<00:03:31.030> heavy<00:03:31.390> and<00:03:31.750> like<00:03:32.050> just<00:03:32.440> each<00:03:33.400> fee<00:03:33.970> I

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
really heavy and like just each fee I

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.110 
really heavy and like just each fee I
saw<00:03:34.209> it<00:03:34.450> earlier<00:03:34.870> he's<00:03:35.790> nasty<00:03:36.790> nasty<00:03:37.320> um<00:03:39.120> but

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
saw it earlier he's nasty nasty um but

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.570

not<00:04:25.360> honestly<00:04:25.810> to<00:04:25.990> saying<00:04:26.260> that<00:04:26.410> I<00:04:26.890> really

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
not honestly to saying that I really

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.460 
not honestly to saying that I really
think<00:04:27.820> is<00:04:28.150> just<00:04:28.330> because<00:04:28.630> the<00:04:28.900> air<00:04:29.140> has<00:04:29.290> come

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
think is just because the air has come

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.490 
think is just because the air has come
