really<00:00:44.300> my<00:00:44.960> interest<00:00:45.289> was<00:00:45.350> in<00:00:45.500> laser<00:00:45.890> first<00:00:46.489> of

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
really my interest was in laser first of

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.639 
really my interest was in laser first of
all<00:00:46.820> an<00:00:47.030> intense<00:00:47.719> pulse<00:00:47.930> light<00:00:48.140> because<00:00:48.500> of

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
all an intense pulse light because of

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.010 
all an intense pulse light because of
what<00:00:48.770> they<00:00:48.920> can<00:00:49.129> do<00:00:49.370> pigment<00:00:50.270> removal<00:00:50.719> thread

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
what they can do pigment removal thread

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.139 
what they can do pigment removal thread
then<00:00:51.260> remove<00:00:51.590> all<00:00:51.860> the<00:00:52.309> skin<00:00:52.550> rejuvenation

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.569 
then remove all the skin rejuvenation
that<00:00:53.570> they<00:00:53.690> provide<00:00:54.199> but<00:00:55.100> actually<00:00:55.250> it's

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
that they provide but actually it's

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.670 
that they provide but actually it's
developed<00:00:56.059> into<00:00:56.300> much<00:00:56.449> more<00:00:56.480> than<00:00:56.899> that<00:00:57.020> so

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
developed into much more than that so

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.439 
developed into much more than that so
what<00:00:57.829> we<00:00:57.949> do<00:00:58.100> is<00:00:58.129> we<00:00:58.309> take<00:00:58.489> people<00:00:58.730> through<00:00:59.359> a

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449
