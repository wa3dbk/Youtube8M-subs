reason I got a call back on this about

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.440 
reason I got a call back on this about
five<00:01:22.259> months<00:01:22.560> after<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.860> put<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.189> in<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:24.270> had

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
five months after I put it in and I had

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.100 
five months after I put it in and I had
to<00:01:24.979> put<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.009> master<00:01:26.280> link<00:01:26.610> back<00:01:26.820> on<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.659> the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
to put a master link back on and the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.440 
to put a master link back on and the
traveler<00:01:28.560> there<00:01:28.740> because<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.790> think<00:01:30.240> what

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
traveler there because I think what

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.870 
traveler there because I think what
happened<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:31.500> for<00:01:32.100> some<00:01:32.280> reason<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.700> rail

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
happened is for some reason the rail

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.719 
happened is for some reason the rail
bounced<00:01:33.119> around<00:01:33.329> just<00:01:33.750> enough<00:01:34.310> for<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.430> end

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
bounced around just enough for that end

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.120 
bounced around just enough for that end
of<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.060> threaded<00:01:36.540> shaft<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:37.049> catch<00:01:37.290> on<00:01:37.590> one

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
of that threaded shaft to catch on one

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.160 
of that threaded shaft to catch on one
of<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.369> rail<00:01:38.490> connections<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.720> just<00:01:40.020> got

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
of the rail connections so I just got

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.899 
of the rail connections so I just got
done<00:01:40.350> adding<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.710> Center<00:01:41.040> hang<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.880> I

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
done adding a Center hang to it and I

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.080 
done adding a Center hang to it and I
hope<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.439> takes<00:01:44.310> care<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.640> any<00:01:45.000> issues

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
hope that that takes care of any issues

00:01:45.090 --> 00:02:06.130 
hope that that takes care of any issues
that<00:01:45.420> we<00:01:46.259> may<00:01:46.409> have<00:01:46.560> here<00:01:47.340> we<00:01:47.430> go
