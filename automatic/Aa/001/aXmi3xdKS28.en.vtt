00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
on a system like this you need to launch

the game get the Nvidia 3d vision going
and<00:00:55.170> then<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.320> actually<00:00:55.710> extrapolates<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.850> 3d

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
and then it actually extrapolates the 3d

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.299 
and then it actually extrapolates the 3d
data<00:00:57.420> that's<00:00:57.719> built<00:00:57.930> into<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.620> game<00:00:58.890> you
