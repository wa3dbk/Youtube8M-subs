 paw river and this is our review of fashion 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.260
 Maincraft in this series will show you 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.559
 a small mod called smart cursor 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.289
 what is the beauty of this mod this mod 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.230
 really helps especially beginners 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.230
 because he reports as much as possible 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.310
 information on this or that subject 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:29.279
 for example, you put grass on a block 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:32.099
 spelled you can assemble this block then 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.649
 there is here for example take a hand on 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.860
 hardcore of course i can if i 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.079
 I will bring such as iron ore is 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.440
 written choose another item for 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.870
 collecting this block then there is some pickaxe 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.850
 and now writes you can collect this 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.770
 block such delphi 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.570
 well besides all this how is it 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.750
 activate and generally something 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.699
 readjust bun f english 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.539
 click and we open coyote 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.190
 socket 1 if it is enabled events 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.979
 understandably what up 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.450
 of it turn off further display and 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:13.229
 block destruction percentage progress 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.180
 bar and can be turned off as a percentage 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:21.180
 let's try for example come up and 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:23.610
 begin to destroy 10 percent 20 30 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.920
 that's cool really cool let's 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.270
 try now 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:33.090
 progress barr so here now we have these 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.509
 more accurately we can determine when 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:41.220
 will be the completion of block destruction so 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:44.700
 say clearly well you know go to 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.729
 percent just what you need at all 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.920
 you can clearly know exactly further 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.290
 health mapping numeric well 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.720
 further he of love turn on turn off and 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.729
 turn on and off everything else this 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.920
 I think you already understand yourself 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.079
 further further what is here with us 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.030
 have additional formations 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.509
 he also turn on the mob again 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.250
 maximum number of hearts in one row 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.160
 further select additional 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.010
 information about the fraction and 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.350
 cola cursor that is in the center and so 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.590
 then you use these settings 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.670
 you can fine-tune everything 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.940
 for themselves 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.220
 so let's be well further 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.710
 look what else is the destruction 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.300
 clear show that you can collect that 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:34.130
 it is also not possible if you want for example 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.590
 something to pick yah like this 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.050
 from afar and you don't know what lies there and 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.600
 once again not to waste time not 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.790
 pick what you don't need right away 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.150
 the center will show what lies there 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.770
 and in what quantity is it very real 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.400
 very cool for example let's get it 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.680
 throw away 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:58.310
 unload it since 1560 is still a diamond sword 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.970
 use of 1560 is left 1 that is 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.440
 a lot of information 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.800
 111 well, it's clear it 's all one by one 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.570
 if for example now 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.490
 gilts a few things quit how many 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.790
 will show 4 things 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.830
 also very very cool so so so well we 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.340
 of course we will pick up everything further 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:22.430
 let's approach for example and to a horse well, very 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.700
 a lot of information shows horse 21 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:28.970
 jump life unit speed not 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.740
 accustomed cub will grow through 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.850
 so much so much 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:37.190
 I understand seconds 720 719 7018 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.989
 could passive that is if he be 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.270
 aggressive thing is clear what will happen 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:44.709
 could appear aggressive further 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:47.810
 horse 2521 speed 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.100
 the strength of the jump is everyone has everything 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.130
 differently 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:55.970
 real each has its own parameters 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:59.660
 Well, well we look further set for example 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:02.680
 a regular pig could passive a pig 10 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.959
 units of life well resident set 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.700
 blacksmith profession up in the center 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.340
 it shows that I really like that 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.220
 the center shows how many units 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.410
 no need to know life once again 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.880
 distracted and not looking at an example 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.590
 are lying 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.120
 here is the food that is just added on the left 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.640
 on top of 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.120
 yes here is some information about some 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.030
 moby 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.450
 if you hover you have to watch 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.550
 up and 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.160
 and so it is much more pancakes 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:33.400

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.490
 he and for professionals for very very 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.820
 experienced miners players the most 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.490
 there are such sworn and who play already 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.320
 many many years 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.050
 suitable for all because it seems so 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.630
 but additional information is always 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.820
 welcome also let's see and 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:12.580
 evil mob example svinozombi what 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.990
 will show 20 day in life could 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.200
 fire resistant 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:20.530

 very very much and of course if i 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:29.320
 Now I will put for example a creeper 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.510
 moba is aggressive by itself he is now 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.420
 will try to beat me in the center 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:36.730
 shows how much is left 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.610
 And I'm already clearly counting accurately 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:42.250
 that before when here such that on privat 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.890
 as the little simple said 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:47.650
 even elementary is suitable for everyone 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:50.490
 item percentage for experienced 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.610
 also come down especially when you destroy 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.830
 obsidian 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.620
 you know, it's not always visible when you mine 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:59.740

 do you see him so much 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:10.360
 percent left that is clearly clearly 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:14.140
 ideally calculate the time and not 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:16.690
 you lose everything in vain and you donâ€™t pick it up 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:19.210
 do not pick too extra blocks from afar 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.040
 you will already know what is lying there 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:23.680
 well, really super simple 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:26.020
