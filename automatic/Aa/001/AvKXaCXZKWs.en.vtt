to<00:00:31.340> exclude<00:00:32.340> as<00:00:32.579> many<00:00:32.880> colors<00:00:33.149> as<00:00:34.110> we<00:00:34.260> can

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
to exclude as many colors as we can

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.860 
to exclude as many colors as we can
except<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.219> yellow<00:00:36.090> part<00:00:36.329> here<00:00:36.660> in<00:00:36.780> the

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
middle so you're going to change the

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.130 
middle so you're going to change the
selection<00:00:39.450> preview<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.829> black<00:00:41.180> matte<00:00:42.180> and

selection preview to black matte and

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.720 
selection preview to black matte and
we're<00:00:43.320> going<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.500> work<00:00:43.710> right<00:00:44.280> now<00:00:44.309> with<00:00:44.610> the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
we're going to work right now with the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.250 
we're going to work right now with the
fastness<00:00:45.950> and<00:00:46.950> as<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.160> can<00:00:47.250> see<00:00:47.899> what<00:00:48.899> happens

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
fastness and as you can see what happens

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.100 
fastness and as you can see what happens
when<00:00:49.289> we<00:00:49.590> are<00:00:49.730> right<00:00:50.730> decreasing<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:51.629> bar<00:00:51.930> is

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
when we are right decreasing this bar is

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.040 
when we are right decreasing this bar is
that<00:00:52.140> we<00:00:52.440> are<00:00:52.699> letting<00:00:53.899> a'dope<00:00:56.960> we<00:00:57.960> are

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
that we are letting a'dope we are

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.549 
that we are letting a'dope we are
letting<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.710> Photoshop<00:00:59.670> to<00:01:00.109> exclude<00:01:01.109> as<00:01:01.320> many

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
letting the Photoshop to exclude as many

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.100 
letting the Photoshop to exclude as many
colors<00:01:01.859> as<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.820> possible<00:01:03.149> count<00:01:03.449> when<00:01:03.899> we<00:01:04.019> are

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
colors as the possible count when we are

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.870 
colors as the possible count when we are
decreasing<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:05.040> we're<00:01:05.159> going<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.369> press<00:01:05.640> this

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
decreasing so we're going to press this

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.940 
decreasing so we're going to press this
yellow<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:08.390> by<00:01:09.390> press<00:01:09.630> holding<00:01:10.439> down<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.710> shift

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
yellow a by press holding down the shift

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.770 
yellow a by press holding down the shift
key<00:01:11.040> we<00:01:11.369> can<00:01:11.400> select<00:01:13.250> several<00:01:14.250> colors<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.689> by

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
key we can select several colors and by

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.630 
key we can select several colors and by
doing<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.110> we<00:01:16.320> are<00:01:16.350> also<00:01:16.950> letting<00:01:17.130> for

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
doing this we are also letting for

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.030 
doing this we are also letting for
Photoshop<00:01:19.970> let<00:01:20.970> giving<00:01:21.930> them<00:01:22.080> more<00:01:22.590> colors<00:01:22.950> to

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
Photoshop let giving them more colors to

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.859 
Photoshop let giving them more colors to
work<00:01:23.159> with<00:01:23.220> around<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.330> we<00:01:24.479> are<00:01:24.540> going<00:01:24.720> to

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
work with around so we are going to

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.740 
work with around so we are going to
decrease<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:26.009> fastness<00:01:26.670> in<00:01:26.880> again<00:01:27.330> to

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
decrease the fastness in again to

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.300 
decrease the fastness in again to
exclude<00:01:28.080> as<00:01:28.259> many<00:01:28.500> college<00:01:28.799> cam

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
exclude as many college cam

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.319 
exclude as many college cam
but<00:01:30.030> as<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.270> can<00:01:30.360> see<00:01:30.420> we<00:01:30.720> are<00:01:30.810> also

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
but as you can see we are also

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:34.819 
but as you can see we are also
decreasing<00:01:33.329> colors<00:01:33.659> here<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.380> middle<00:01:34.710> of

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
decreasing colors here in the middle of

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.300 
decreasing colors here in the middle of
the<00:01:34.979> egg<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.820> what<00:01:36.299> we<00:01:36.420> are<00:01:36.479> going<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.930> do

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
the egg so what we are going to do

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.770 
the egg so what we are going to do
instead<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:39.119> we<00:01:39.240> are<00:01:39.299> going<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.570> press

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
instead is that we are going to press

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.889 
instead is that we are going to press
the<00:01:39.930> localized<00:01:40.439> color<00:01:40.740> clusters<00:01:41.630> and<00:01:42.630> we<00:01:42.689> are

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
the localized color clusters and we are

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.469 
the localized color clusters and we are
going<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.140> well<00:01:44.070> work<00:01:44.670> with<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:44.970> range<00:01:45.920> and

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
going to well work with the range and

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:53.389 
going to well work with the range and
the<00:01:48.479> fastness<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.770> we<00:01:49.890> can<00:01:50.750> simply<00:01:52.399> just

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
the fastness so that we can simply just

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.139 
the fastness so that we can simply just
ignores<00:01:53.759> many<00:01:54.030> colors<00:01:54.509> around<00:01:54.840> as<00:01:55.140> possible

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
ignores many colors around as possible

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.760 
ignores many colors around as possible
right<00:01:57.149> now<00:01:57.329> I'm<00:01:57.479> going<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.719> decrease<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.619> as

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
right now I'm going to decrease and as

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.870 
right now I'm going to decrease and as
you<00:01:58.920> can<00:01:59.009> see<00:01:59.159> we<00:01:59.399> are<00:02:01.040> pretty<00:02:02.040> much<00:02:02.280> ignoring

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
you can see we are pretty much ignoring

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.029 
you can see we are pretty much ignoring
every<00:02:03.299> color<00:02:05.540> except<00:02:06.540> this<00:02:07.500> yellow

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
every color except this yellow

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.360 
every color except this yellow
little<00:02:09.759> a<00:02:09.879> little<00:02:10.179> image<00:02:10.629> does<00:02:11.379> can<00:02:11.590> see<00:02:11.739> oops

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
little a little image does can see oops

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.960 
little a little image does can see oops
as<00:02:12.849> you<00:02:12.940> can<00:02:13.030> see<00:02:13.180> we<00:02:13.360> are<00:02:13.390> also<00:02:13.659> having<00:02:14.319> a<00:02:14.970> some

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
as you can see we are also having a some

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.009 
as you can see we are also having a some
yellow<00:02:16.239> part<00:02:16.569> around<00:02:16.810> and<00:02:17.379> this<00:02:18.310> is<00:02:18.840> not<00:02:19.840> too

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
yellow part around and this is not too

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.559 
yellow part around and this is not too
bad<00:02:20.170> we<00:02:20.799> can<00:02:21.010> change<00:02:21.220> it<00:02:21.430> change<00:02:22.060> this<00:02:22.239> later

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
bad we can change it change this later
