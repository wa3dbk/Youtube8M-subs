pretty<00:00:57.690> simple<00:00:57.930> 5<00:00:58.800> minute<00:00:59.190> job<00:00:59.570> might<00:01:00.570> be<00:01:00.600> a

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
pretty simple 5 minute job might be a

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.860 
pretty simple 5 minute job might be a
minute<00:01:01.020> or<00:01:01.109> two<00:01:01.260> longer<00:01:01.500> with<00:01:02.010> them<00:01:02.600> doing<00:01:03.600> it

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
and simple here let's see how how easy I

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:20.340 
and simple here let's see how how easy I
make<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.510> look

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.870 

and<00:01:21.350> then<00:01:21.500> we'll<00:01:21.650> do<00:01:21.770> a<00:01:21.799> start<00:01:22.220> and<00:01:22.490> see<00:01:22.700> how

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
and then we'll do a start and see how

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:31.389 
and then we'll do a start and see how
well<00:01:24.159> well<00:01:25.159> she<00:01:25.430> works<00:01:26.619> that<00:01:27.619> little<00:01:30.399> screws

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
right there you just screw it out and

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.260 
right there you just screw it out and
you<00:01:33.799> got<00:01:33.950> to<00:01:34.070> be<00:01:34.130> careful<00:01:34.340> because<00:01:34.580> underneath

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
you got to be careful because underneath

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.830 
you got to be careful because underneath
it<00:01:35.659> it's<00:01:35.899> got<00:01:36.110> a<00:01:36.380> nut<00:01:37.030> that<00:01:38.030> helps<00:01:38.420> lock<00:01:38.630> it

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
it it's got a nut that helps lock it
