00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.150 
and then right before I walk out the
door<00:02:26.400> I'll<00:02:27.060> untie<00:02:27.570> it<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:28.020> it's<00:02:28.710> perfectly

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.540 
neat
like<00:02:50.130> I<00:02:50.280> said<00:02:50.520> is<00:02:50.730> wrapping<00:02:51.210> it<00:02:51.330> at<00:02:51.480> night<00:02:51.660> and

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
like I said is wrapping it at night and

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.850 
like I said is wrapping it at night and
wearing<00:02:53.550> this<00:02:53.730> headband<00:02:54.300> if<00:02:54.660> I<00:02:55.170> didn't<00:02:55.650> wear<00:02:55.800> a

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
wearing this headband if I didn't wear a

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.100 
wearing this headband if I didn't wear a
headband<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.490> pull<00:02:56.730> my<00:02:56.970> hair<00:02:57.000> back<00:02:57.270> out<00:02:57.780> of<00:02:57.959> my

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
headband to pull my hair back out of my

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.330 
headband to pull my hair back out of my
face

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
face

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.460 
face
the<00:03:00.060> roots<00:03:00.360> would<00:03:00.570> rub<00:03:00.780> against<00:03:01.140> each<00:03:01.230> other

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
the roots would rub against each other

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.720 
the roots would rub against each other
and<00:03:01.830> therefore<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:03.000> would<00:03:03.090> get<00:03:03.209> bushy<00:03:03.450> so<00:03:04.140> I

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
and therefore it would get bushy so I

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.160 
and therefore it would get bushy so I
personally<00:03:05.730> wear<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.420> headband<00:03:06.780> because<00:03:07.080> I

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
personally wear the headband because I

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.560 
personally wear the headband because I
don't<00:03:07.380> like<00:03:07.650> my<00:03:07.680> hair<00:03:08.520> just<00:03:08.940> falling<00:03:09.360> in<00:03:09.450> my

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
don't like my hair just falling in my

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.120 
don't like my hair just falling in my
face<00:03:09.840> when<00:03:10.200> I<00:03:10.230> lean<00:03:10.470> forward

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
face when I lean forward

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.310 
face when I lean forward
so<00:03:11.580> even<00:03:11.880> when<00:03:12.030> I<00:03:12.090> lean<00:03:12.300> forward<00:03:12.330> now<00:03:12.840> you<00:03:12.900> know

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
so even when I lean forward now you know

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.830 
so even when I lean forward now you know
a<00:03:13.350> few<00:03:13.740> walks<00:03:13.980> will<00:03:14.190> fall<00:03:14.430> but<00:03:15.270> it's<00:03:15.450> not<00:03:15.600> all

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
a few walks will fall but it's not all

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.050 
a few walks will fall but it's not all
falling<00:03:16.320> in<00:03:16.410> my<00:03:16.500> face<00:03:16.740> because<00:03:17.310> of<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.520> the

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
falling in my face because of the the

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.570 
falling in my face because of the the
headband<00:03:18.420> and<00:03:18.990> I<00:03:19.320> like<00:03:19.560> wearing<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.220> headband

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
headband and I like wearing the headband

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.360 
headband and I like wearing the headband
on<00:03:20.790> a<00:03:20.820> daily<00:03:21.270> -<00:03:21.540> because<00:03:22.050> when<00:03:22.890> my<00:03:23.010> hair<00:03:23.250> is

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
on a daily - because when my hair is

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.699 
on a daily - because when my hair is
bone<00:03:23.580> straight<00:03:23.880> like<00:03:24.090> I<00:03:24.209> said<00:03:24.480> it's<00:03:25.110> nice<00:03:25.380> and

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
bone straight like I said it's nice and

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:26.870 
bone straight like I said it's nice and
thick<00:03:25.920> but<00:03:26.070> it<00:03:26.190> doesn't<00:03:26.489> have<00:03:26.610> a<00:03:26.640> lot<00:03:26.850> of

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
thick but it doesn't have a lot of

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.300 
thick but it doesn't have a lot of
volume<00:03:27.239> to<00:03:27.510> it<00:03:27.900> so<00:03:28.440> just<00:03:28.920> wearing<00:03:29.100> the

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
volume to it so just wearing the

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.890 
volume to it so just wearing the
headband<00:03:29.670> kind<00:03:29.970> of<00:03:30.060> gives<00:03:30.269> it<00:03:30.420> this<00:03:30.630> like

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
headband kind of gives it this like

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.770 
headband kind of gives it this like
extra<00:03:31.410> little<00:03:31.620> volume<00:03:32.430> right<00:03:32.640> here<00:03:32.670> and<00:03:33.510> I<00:03:33.630> can

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
extra little volume right here and I can

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.170 
extra little volume right here and I can
push<00:03:33.959> it<00:03:33.989> forward<00:03:34.560> or<00:03:34.800> push<00:03:35.280> it<00:03:35.310> all<00:03:35.519> back<00:03:35.790> and

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
push it forward or push it all back and

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.430 
push it forward or push it all back and
it<00:03:37.080> keeps<00:03:37.290> it<00:03:37.470> nice<00:03:37.590> and<00:03:37.650> neat<00:03:37.950> i<00:03:39.140> retwist<00:03:40.140> as

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
it keeps it nice and neat i retwist as

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.479 
it keeps it nice and neat i retwist as
necessary<00:03:41.100> and<00:03:41.400> I<00:03:42.320> don't<00:03:43.320> suggest<00:03:43.709> it<00:03:44.250> for

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
necessary and I don't suggest it for

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.060 
necessary and I don't suggest it for
everyone<00:03:44.940> because<00:03:45.420> everyone's<00:03:46.410> hair<00:03:46.650> texture

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
everyone because everyone's hair texture

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.550 
everyone because everyone's hair texture
is<00:03:47.160> different<00:03:47.340> if<00:03:47.880> you<00:03:48.150> have<00:03:48.390> thin<00:03:48.750> hair<00:03:48.989> or

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
is different if you have thin hair or

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.590 
is different if you have thin hair or
thinning<00:03:50.070> hair<00:03:50.370> it<00:03:50.580> probably<00:03:51.000> isn't<00:03:51.360> a<00:03:51.420> good

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
thinning hair it probably isn't a good

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.250 
thinning hair it probably isn't a good
idea<00:03:51.769> to<00:03:52.769> retwist<00:03:53.610> your<00:03:54.090> front<00:03:54.480> row<00:03:54.780> or<00:03:55.200> any

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
idea to retwist your front row or any

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.070 
idea to retwist your front row or any
part<00:03:55.739> of<00:03:55.830> your<00:03:55.950> hair<00:03:56.190> too<00:03:56.580> often

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
part of your hair too often

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.430 
part of your hair too often
I<00:03:58.110> probably<00:03:58.530> retwist<00:03:59.790> the<00:04:00.330> front<00:04:00.660> row<00:04:00.959> of<00:04:01.350> my

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
I probably retwist the front row of my

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.350 
I probably retwist the front row of my
locs<00:04:01.980> about<00:04:02.250> once<00:04:02.519> a<00:04:02.700> week<00:04:02.880> maybe<00:04:03.239> twice

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
locs about once a week maybe twice

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.030 
locs about once a week maybe twice
depending<00:04:04.260> on<00:04:05.360> what<00:04:06.360> it<00:04:06.420> looks<00:04:06.570> like

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
depending on what it looks like

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.890 
depending on what it looks like
sometimes<00:04:08.040> it's<00:04:08.340> just<00:04:08.519> a<00:04:08.730> matter<00:04:08.910> of<00:04:09.060> adding<00:04:09.690> a

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
sometimes it's just a matter of adding a

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.630 
sometimes it's just a matter of adding a
little<00:04:10.019> extra<00:04:10.230> gel<00:04:10.650> to<00:04:10.860> the<00:04:10.890> edges<00:04:11.370> and

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
little extra gel to the edges and

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.340 
little extra gel to the edges and
wrapping<00:04:12.060> my<00:04:12.150> scarf<00:04:12.480> in<00:04:12.630> the<00:04:12.660> morning<00:04:13.050> and
