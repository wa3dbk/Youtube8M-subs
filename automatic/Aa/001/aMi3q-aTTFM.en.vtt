don't have already now the way the vest
actually<00:01:38.179> connects<00:01:38.509> together<00:01:38.689> is<00:01:39.049> with<00:01:39.289> some

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
actually connects together is with some

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.289 
actually connects together is with some
luggage<00:01:40.249> straps<00:01:40.549> that<00:01:40.700> have<00:01:40.789> been<00:01:40.909> cut<00:01:41.149> up<00:01:41.179> and

luggage straps that have been cut up and

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.510 
luggage straps that have been cut up and
suck<00:01:41.719> at<00:01:41.960> precise<00:01:42.740> position<00:01:43.189> so<00:01:43.310> you<00:01:43.399> can

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
suck at precise position so you can

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.160 
suck at precise position so you can
click<00:01:43.759> it<00:01:43.880> together<00:01:44.149> once<00:01:44.359> it's<00:01:44.509> on<00:01:44.719> there<00:01:45.079> on

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
click it together once it's on there on

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.059 
click it together once it's on there on
the<00:01:45.259> other<00:01:45.380> side<00:01:45.590> there<00:01:45.799> you<00:01:45.829> might<00:01:46.039> be

00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:46.069 
the other side there you might be

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:47.919 
the other side there you might be
thinking<00:01:46.490> that<00:01:46.520> it<00:01:46.700> looks<00:01:46.880> kind<00:01:47.030> of<00:01:47.420> not<00:01:47.899> that

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
thinking that it looks kind of not that

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:49.809 
thinking that it looks kind of not that
great<00:01:48.380> that's<00:01:48.770> because<00:01:49.069> the<00:01:49.189> jacket<00:01:49.520> covers

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:49.819 
great that's because the jacket covers

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:51.039 
great that's because the jacket covers
it<00:01:49.939> up<00:01:49.999> so<00:01:50.149> I<00:01:50.179> didn't<00:01:50.389> put<00:01:50.479> a<00:01:50.539> lot<00:01:50.569> of<00:01:50.780> effort

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
it up so I didn't put a lot of effort

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:52.599 
it up so I didn't put a lot of effort
into<00:01:51.170> making<00:01:51.289> that<00:01:51.619> look<00:01:51.740> pretty<00:01:51.979> also<00:01:52.310> the

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:52.609 
into making that look pretty also the

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:53.709 
into making that look pretty also the
same<00:01:52.789> at<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:52.999> back<00:01:53.179> of<00:01:53.299> the<00:01:53.359> vest<00:01:53.539> that's

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:53.719 
same at the back of the vest that's

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:55.300 
same at the back of the vest that's
completely<00:01:54.109> covered<00:01:54.469> by<00:01:54.499> the<00:01:54.590> leather<00:01:54.920> jacket

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
completely covered by the leather jacket

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.129 
completely covered by the leather jacket
so<00:01:55.340> it<00:01:55.759> can<00:01:56.119> look<00:01:56.270> like<00:01:56.389> anything<00:01:56.689> it<00:01:56.899> doesn't

00:01:57.129 --> 00:01:57.139 
so it can look like anything it doesn't

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:58.989 
so it can look like anything it doesn't
really<00:01:57.229> matter<00:01:57.469> now<00:01:57.679> the<00:01:57.859> gun<00:01:58.249> holster<00:01:58.729> on<00:01:58.909> the
