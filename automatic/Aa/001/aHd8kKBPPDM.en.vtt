00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:13.690
 I make a piece cut off and then ours I 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:17.530
 I will see 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:21.040
 zander jokes already a lot of bones that no 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.040
 middling such 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.140
 the skins of the day and I will not take off 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:37.110
 small as a bone- type pulp 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:42.829
 left here I 'll write out something like that 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:45.829
 hard to go on the bone and cut so 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.829
 farther 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.390
 over the ridge once and cut 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:28.030
 a piece of flash drive right here ridge it all 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:35.099
 I will not have a clean filet of acos skin 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:35.099
 shoot here what else is another piece 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:42.659
 bones and more clear I will not be you 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:42.659
 torment 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:53.320
 so I redid everything on red filet 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:57.490
 the fish I had been boldly then 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:00.250
 the skin is she thick sudachok on my 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.399
 filiera made here onion one 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.549
 cleaned cut and 2 buns 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:08.880
 two pieces of button dry were wet 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:13.239
 but not so smooth the attacks there 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.590
 I felt rather dry now 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:19.879
 twist us 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.540

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:23.150
 OK 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.510
 I will not add an egg so it will 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:32.060
 composing burgers will be more accurate and juicier 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:36.650
 only better salt to taste pepper to who 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:39.319
 loves oil in a skillet 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:49.760
 vegetable hands 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:51.200
 I dip some water so I water in 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:59.049
 breadcrumbs 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:59.049
 how is it so already brought 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:14.180
 if it is minced from one pike perch, you can 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.840
 add a spoon of mayonnaise so fish itself 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.730
 very dry and so i took this one 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.930
 set for soup, it is inexpensive red 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:27.140

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:30.790

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.790

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.730
