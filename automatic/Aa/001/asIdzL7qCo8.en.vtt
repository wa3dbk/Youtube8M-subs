this<00:02:06.330> is<00:02:06.540> just<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.960> demo<00:02:07.200> for<00:02:07.530> race<00:02:07.740> Oh<00:02:07.950> seven

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980

I'll<00:02:22.490> show<00:02:22.730> you<00:02:22.790> guys<00:02:23.000> how<00:02:23.060> accurate<00:02:23.780> the

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
I'll show you guys how accurate the

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.630 
I'll show you guys how accurate the
steering<00:02:24.200> wheel<00:02:24.350> is<00:02:24.560> it's<00:02:25.250> more<00:02:25.430> accurate

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
steering wheel is it's more accurate

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.160 
steering wheel is it's more accurate
than<00:02:25.970> I<00:02:26.090> thought<00:02:26.270> it<00:02:26.420> was<00:02:26.480> going<00:02:26.660> to<00:02:26.720> be<00:02:26.870> but

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
than I thought it was going to be but

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.870 
than I thought it was going to be but
it's<00:02:27.860> still<00:02:28.250> not<00:02:29.770> that<00:02:30.770> good<00:02:31.160> but<00:02:31.400> hopefully

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
it's still not that good but hopefully

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.770 
it's still not that good but hopefully
once<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.240> Wii<00:02:32.390> MotionPlus<00:02:32.810> is<00:02:33.560> out<00:02:34.780> that'll

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
once the Wii MotionPlus is out that'll

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.260 
once the Wii MotionPlus is out that'll
make<00:02:35.930> it<00:02:35.959> a<00:02:36.110> lot<00:02:36.140> more<00:02:36.560> accurate<00:02:37.190> or<00:02:37.819> once<00:02:38.090> the

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
make it a lot more accurate or once the

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:46.949 
make it a lot more accurate or once the
Wii<00:02:38.390> MotionPlus<00:02:38.750> is<00:02:39.110> supported<00:02:39.590> by<00:02:39.850> love<00:02:40.850> pie

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
the drive you can see that it turns

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.340 
the drive you can see that it turns
right<00:03:06.950> with<00:03:07.820> it

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
right with it

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.920 
right with it
but<00:03:09.350> you're<00:03:10.310> going<00:03:10.640> fast<00:03:10.910> and<00:03:11.209> making<00:03:11.540> turns

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
but you're going fast and making turns

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.840 
but you're going fast and making turns
you<00:03:12.170> really<00:03:12.410> gotta<00:03:12.790> be<00:03:13.790> used<00:03:14.060> to<00:03:14.300> this<00:03:14.510> or<00:03:14.930> else

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
you really gotta be used to this or else

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.180 
you really gotta be used to this or else
it's<00:03:16.850> kind<00:03:17.180> of<00:03:17.239> tough<00:03:17.450> to<00:03:17.600> control<00:03:17.780> so<00:03:18.560> this<00:03:19.010> is

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
it's kind of tough to control so this is

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.910 
it's kind of tough to control so this is
only<00:03:19.340> my<00:03:19.580> second<00:03:20.030> day<00:03:20.060> using<00:03:20.600> it<00:03:20.720> and<00:03:21.290> I'm

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
only my second day using it and I'm

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.940 
only my second day using it and I'm
getting<00:03:22.070> a<00:03:22.250> little<00:03:22.370> better<00:03:22.580> at<00:03:22.730> it<00:03:22.880> but<00:03:23.150> I<00:03:23.950> mean

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
getting a little better at it but I mean

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.190 
getting a little better at it but I mean
it's<00:03:25.130> almost<00:03:25.310> one-to-one<00:03:25.820> but<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:27.079> Wii

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
it's almost one-to-one but the Wii

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.220 
it's almost one-to-one but the Wii
MotionPlus<00:03:27.590> will<00:03:27.950> make<00:03:28.100> it<00:03:28.220> a<00:03:28.280> lot<00:03:28.430> better<00:03:28.700> and

this<00:03:50.439> wee<00:03:50.739> remote<00:03:51.069> pointing<00:03:51.849> at<00:03:51.970> three<00:03:52.420> pedals

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
this wee remote pointing at three pedals

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.410 
this wee remote pointing at three pedals
pedals<00:03:53.860> have<00:03:54.220> infrared<00:03:54.700> lights<00:03:55.060> on<00:03:55.299> the

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
pedals have infrared lights on the

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.380 
pedals have infrared lights on the
bottom<00:03:55.780> and<00:03:55.959> when<00:03:56.110> I<00:03:56.140> put<00:03:56.500> my<00:03:56.530> hand<00:03:56.950> in<00:03:57.069> the<00:03:57.190> way

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.110 
and pull it away glove pairi assigns
them<00:04:02.109> so<00:04:02.470> they'll<00:04:02.799> be<00:04:02.950> different<00:04:04.530> now<00:04:05.530> this'll

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
as the gas that's one problem I really

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.009 
as the gas that's one problem I really
don't<00:04:09.190> know<00:04:09.310> how<00:04:09.519> to<00:04:09.579> fix<00:04:09.879> it<00:04:10.060> but<00:04:10.500> if<00:04:11.500> you<00:04:11.680> just

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
don't know how to fix it but if you just

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.599 
don't know how to fix it but if you just
keep<00:04:14.019> it<00:04:14.200> at<00:04:14.290> your<00:04:14.409> feet<00:04:14.620> and<00:04:14.859> don't<00:04:15.310> mess<00:04:15.579> with

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609 
keep it at your feet and don't mess with

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:18.870 
keep it at your feet and don't mess with
it<00:04:15.940> it'll<00:04:16.150> usually<00:04:16.389> stay<00:04:16.810> right<00:04:17.310> but<00:04:18.310> other

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
it it'll usually stay right but other

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.330 
it it'll usually stay right but other
than<00:04:19.090> that<00:04:19.150> it's<00:04:19.449> pretty<00:04:19.510> cool<00:04:19.989> this<00:04:20.919> is<00:04:21.250> a

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
than that it's pretty cool this is a

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:27.810 
than that it's pretty cool this is a
shifter<00:04:23.310> and<00:04:24.310> see<00:04:25.830> it's<00:04:26.830> just<00:04:27.070> a<00:04:27.220> sequential

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
shifter and see it's just a sequential

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.480 
shifter and see it's just a sequential
shifter<00:04:28.389> and<00:04:28.510> that<00:04:29.289> map<00:04:29.530> to<00:04:29.710> the<00:04:29.800> analog<00:04:30.160> stick

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
shifter and that map to the analog stick

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.460 
shifter and that map to the analog stick
of<00:04:30.610> the<00:04:30.639> nunchuck<00:04:32.010> alright<00:04:33.010> it's<00:04:33.820> really<00:04:34.090> cool

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
of the nunchuck alright it's really cool

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.770 
of the nunchuck alright it's really cool
I'm<00:04:35.470> cost<00:04:35.740> me<00:04:35.919> six<00:04:36.220> dollars<00:04:36.490> so<00:04:37.030> I<00:04:37.300> think<00:04:37.660> it's

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
I'm cost me six dollars so I think it's

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.900 
I'm cost me six dollars so I think it's
definitely<00:04:38.020> a<00:04:38.320> better<00:04:38.440> deal<00:04:38.710> than<00:04:38.770> paying<00:04:39.340> 300

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
definitely a better deal than paying 300

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.969 
definitely a better deal than paying 300
for<00:04:40.120> a<00:04:40.150> g25<00:04:41.020> or<00:04:41.349> whatever<00:04:41.620> I<00:04:43.800> hope<00:04:44.800> this

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
for a g25 or whatever I hope this

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:48.419 
for a g25 or whatever I hope this
inspires<00:04:45.160> somebody<00:04:45.729> to<00:04:45.970> make<00:04:46.120> it<00:04:46.240> better
