00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:10.920
 knitting double sided tunisian crochet 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:15.389
 as you can see from one side and 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:19.619
 the other side is a hook usually 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:23.460
 such crochet knit products in a circle and 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.499
 for knitting we need to be sure 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.029
 2 balls of thread 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:32.730
 I will take balls of different colors 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:39.150
 first knit the air chain 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:42.690
 desired length and then connect the first and 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:51.260
 last loop of a series of connecting 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:55.920
 the loop now made a ring of 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.570
 air loops and proceed to knit 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.950
 typesetting 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:05.040
 for this hook we drive in the next 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:11.090
 air loop and take out the loop and 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.090
 so do a few more times 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.550
 so I scored a few loops and more 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.290
 I have already become uncomfortable dial loops 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:30.870
 so we will knit the next row 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.450
 when circular knitting is necessary 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:36.410
 turn the work on the wrong side 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.040
 and now we will knit 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:44.190
 thread of a different color on the other hand 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:47.000
 for this we move the hook like this 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:51.090
 way and we will knit 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.670
 first knit a thread of a different color 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:58.200
 extreme loop 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:02:02.610
 air loop and then we will close 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:05.640
 two loops together but if you knit 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.750
 some more complex pattern then 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.750
 knit according to the scheme 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:24.200
 and here I closed these loops now again 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:29.840
 turn knitting to the other side 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:39.110
 hook move and we will knit again 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:39.110
 previous thread picking up loops on 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:54.240
 as long as they will fit on 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:57.270
 hook and it will be convenient for us to do and 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:02.550
 further knitting is repeated 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:08.310
 move the hook turn the work and 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:12.340
 close the loop of the back row 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.550
 as usual, well, only from the other 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.550
 parties 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:40.740
 now knitting 1 row finished 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.740
 roll over to the other side and 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:48.430
 will knit again 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:51.430
 we thread a red hook for this 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:56.920
 under the Tunisian vertical leg 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:04:01.060
 column and pull out the loop and just 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:04.260
 same as we knitted 1 row knit all 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.260
 other rows 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:17.610
 so I scored as many loops as u 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:20.850
 me fit on the hook then 

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:27.070
 flips to the opposite direction 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:29.700
 move the hook and close the loop 2 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.700
 together 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:41.960
 further visa is not carried out on 

00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:44.270
 circular spirals 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.309
 usually knit in those cases when 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.879
 need to avoid seam 

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:53.029
 for example, it may be mittens socks 

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:56.869
 hats or other products 

00:04:53.029 --> 00:05:01.159
 and also it should be noted that when knitting 

00:04:56.869 --> 00:05:04.309
 Round patterns will differ from those 

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:09.050
 patterns that we knit the usual 

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:12.289
 I invite you to visit the page 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.990
 catalog where you will find all the symbols 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:18.709
 and lessons on tunisian knitting 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:22.639
 as well as if this lesson was helpful to you 

00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:24.729
 put likes and i will be glad to yours
