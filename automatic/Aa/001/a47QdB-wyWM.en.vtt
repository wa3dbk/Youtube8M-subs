first 10 minutes and just talk to
something<00:00:52.620> over<00:00:53.070> some<00:00:53.250> basic<00:00:53.730> music<00:00:54.510> theory

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
something over some basic music theory

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.990 
something over some basic music theory
stuff<00:00:55.170> just<00:00:55.739> in<00:00:55.860> case<00:00:56.010> some<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.550> us<00:00:56.699> might<00:00:56.820> have

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
stuff just in case some of us might have

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.510 
stuff just in case some of us might have
no<00:00:57.149> time<00:00:57.809> signatures<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.590> no<00:00:58.859> values<00:00:59.309> and

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
no time signatures and no values and

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.340 
no time signatures and no values and
things<00:00:59.699> like<00:00:59.820> that<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.270> then<00:01:00.690> we're<00:01:01.199> going<00:01:01.289> to

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
things like that and then we're going to

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.709 
things like that and then we're going to
get<00:01:01.530> into<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.890> actual<00:01:02.190> actual<00:01:03.000> piece

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
get into the actual actual piece

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.850 
get into the actual actual piece
potatoes<00:01:04.229> motives<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:06.020> start<00:01:07.020> off<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.470> if

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
potatoes motives so start off the if

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.679 
potatoes motives so start off the if
we're<00:01:08.220> looking<00:01:08.310> at<00:01:08.580> at<00:01:08.909> music<00:01:09.420> we<00:01:09.540> have<00:01:09.630> a

spaces these lines represent different
pitches<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:16.320> then<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.530> time<00:01:16.770> signature<00:01:17.040> will

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
pitches and then the time signature will

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.560 
pitches and then the time signature will
be<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.490> next<00:01:17.640> thing<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.240> something<00:01:18.540> that

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570

today<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.820> time<00:01:21.060> signature<00:01:21.330> represents

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
today and the time signature represents

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.130 
today and the time signature represents

standard pretty basic stuff so i'm
pretty<00:03:00.170> sure<00:03:00.440> that<00:03:00.470> most<00:03:00.709> of<00:03:00.799> us<00:03:00.890> know<00:03:01.040> so<00:03:01.220> now

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
pretty sure that most of us know so now

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.300 
pretty sure that most of us know so now
we<00:03:01.400> all<00:03:01.760> know<00:03:01.790> knotted<00:03:02.780> notes<00:03:02.989> a<00:03:03.290> dotted<00:03:04.160> note

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
we all know knotted notes a dotted note

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.289 
we all know knotted notes a dotted note
would<00:03:04.519> be<00:03:04.640> when<00:03:04.820> we<00:03:04.910> get<00:03:05.030> into<00:03:05.150> our

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
would be when we get into our

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.130 
would be when we get into our
syncopation<00:03:05.989> a<00:03:06.170> dotted<00:03:06.799> note<00:03:07.010> is<00:03:07.930> so<00:03:08.930> if<00:03:08.989> it's

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
syncopation a dotted note is so if it's

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.170 
syncopation a dotted note is so if it's
a<00:03:09.200> quarter<00:03:09.470> note<00:03:09.560> it's<00:03:09.980> portable<00:03:10.519> the<00:03:10.910> notes

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
a quarter note it's portable the notes

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.420 
a quarter note it's portable the notes
value<00:03:11.690> plus<00:03:11.930> half<00:03:12.170> so<00:03:12.470> that<00:03:12.709> meeting<00:03:13.370> a

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
value plus half so that meeting a

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.740 
value plus half so that meeting a
quarter<00:03:13.730> note<00:03:13.760> is<00:03:14.030> worth<00:03:14.239> 1<00:03:15.049> b<00:03:16.239> plus<00:03:17.239> half<00:03:17.570> of

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
quarter note is worth 1 b plus half of

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.539 
quarter note is worth 1 b plus half of
that<00:03:17.900> value<00:03:18.200> which<00:03:18.560> would<00:03:18.829> make<00:03:18.980> it<00:03:19.130> a<00:03:19.190> half<00:03:19.370> is

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
that value which would make it a half is

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.400 
that value which would make it a half is
course<00:03:19.790> one<00:03:20.000> and<00:03:20.120> a<00:03:20.180> half<00:03:20.209> beats<00:03:20.540> all<00:03:21.110> right<00:03:21.200> so

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
course one and a half beats all right so

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.340 
course one and a half beats all right so
it<00:03:21.500> would<00:03:21.920> hold<00:03:22.130> out<00:03:22.310> alright<00:03:23.030> so<00:03:23.329> we're<00:03:24.230> going

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
it would hold out alright so we're going

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:25.569 
it would hold out alright so we're going
