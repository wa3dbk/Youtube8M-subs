beginners the guitar operates by the

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.849 
beginners the guitar operates by the
fact<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.500> strings<00:00:16.800> vibrate<00:00:18.859> they

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
fact that the strings vibrate they

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.480 
fact that the strings vibrate they
vibrating<00:00:20.430> from<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.970> nut<00:00:21.439> to<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.560> bridge<00:00:25.490> by

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
vibrating from the nut to the bridge by

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.279 
vibrating from the nut to the bridge by
pressing<00:00:26.910> your<00:00:27.029> finger<00:00:27.330> down<00:00:27.599> behind<00:00:27.840> with

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
pressing your finger down behind with

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.870 
pressing your finger down behind with
these<00:00:28.470> silver<00:00:29.250> lines<00:00:29.460> which<00:00:29.730> are<00:00:29.820> called

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
these silver lines which are called

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.240 
these silver lines which are called
frets<00:00:30.470> effectively<00:00:31.470> you're<00:00:31.590> shortening<00:00:32.040> the

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
frets effectively you're shortening the

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.660 
frets effectively you're shortening the
string<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.850> thereby<00:00:33.950> cutting<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.460> length

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
string and thereby cutting the length

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.000 
string and thereby cutting the length
off<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.360> vibrates<00:00:36.870> so<00:00:37.500> we're<00:00:37.680> shortening

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
off that vibrates so we're shortening

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.180 
off that vibrates so we're shortening
them<00:00:38.340> out<00:00:38.430> vibrating<00:00:39.120> string<00:00:39.450> there<00:00:39.690> and

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
them out vibrating string there and

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.850 
them out vibrating string there and
therefore<00:00:41.190> change<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.670> pitch<00:00:42.530> this<00:00:43.530> means

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
therefore change the pitch this means

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.590 
therefore change the pitch this means
that<00:00:44.040> we<00:00:44.190> can<00:00:44.370> move<00:00:44.550> around<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:45.000> bit<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.329> get

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
that we can move around a bit and get

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:57.440 
that we can move around a bit and get
load<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:45.960> different<00:00:46.230> pitches<00:00:46.379> off<00:00:46.770> any<00:00:47.100> string

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.180 

fundamentally<00:00:58.450> the<00:00:58.600> guitarist<00:00:59.170> will<00:00:59.920> play

fundamentally the guitarist will play

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.710 
fundamentally the guitarist will play
chords<00:01:00.820> much<00:01:00.970> of<00:01:01.150> the<00:01:01.210> time<00:01:02.910> most<00:01:03.910> easy<00:01:04.330> kind

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
chords much of the time most easy kind

of<00:01:04.809> cool<00:01:04.989> shape<00:01:05.199> you<00:01:05.320> can<00:01:05.470> do<00:01:05.680> is<00:01:05.980> called<00:01:06.280> a

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
of cool shape you can do is called a

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.150

power chord power chords are so cool

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.380 
power chord power chords are so cool
because<00:01:09.340> you<00:01:09.550> can't<00:01:09.820> tell<00:01:10.030> whether<00:01:10.150> they're

because you can't tell whether they're

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.790 
because you can't tell whether they're
major<00:01:10.660> or<00:01:10.900> minor<00:01:11.080> and<00:01:11.380> they're<00:01:11.500> using<00:01:11.650> the

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.700 
this is going to be a gap finger three
we'll<00:01:42.009> play<00:01:42.190> the<00:01:42.340> next<00:01:42.490> ring<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:44.290> you<00:01:44.350> get<00:01:44.590> this

number<00:01:55.330> of<00:01:56.020> famous<00:01:56.320> tunes<00:01:56.800> here's<00:01:57.310> why

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.780 

the<00:02:15.870> way<00:02:15.990> this<00:02:16.200> one's<00:02:16.410> played<00:02:16.740> I'm<00:02:17.430> playing

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
the way this one's played I'm playing

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.350 
the way this one's played I'm playing
I'm<00:02:18.780> taking<00:02:19.230> my<00:02:19.500> root<00:02:19.770> note<00:02:19.850> my<00:02:20.850> finger<00:02:21.150> number

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
I'm taking my root note my finger number

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.660 
I'm taking my root note my finger number
one<00:02:21.570> is<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:22.050> numbers<00:02:22.530> I'm<00:02:22.650> giving<00:02:22.770> you<00:02:23.010> now<00:02:23.040> so

one is the numbers I'm giving you now so

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.440 
one is the numbers I'm giving you now so
firstly<00:02:24.120> it's<00:02:24.870> on<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.170> third<00:02:25.470> fret<00:02:26.390> then<00:02:27.390> he

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
firstly it's on the third fret then he

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.990 
firstly it's on the third fret then he
goes<00:02:27.630> up<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.960> sixth<00:02:28.260> fret<00:02:28.880> then<00:02:29.880> the

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
goes up to the sixth fret then the

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.770 
goes up to the sixth fret then the
eighth<00:02:30.150> fret<00:02:31.580> and<00:02:32.580> I'll<00:02:32.730> do<00:02:32.820> it<00:02:32.910> again<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:33.450> in

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
eighth fret and I'll do it again and in

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.620 
eighth fret and I'll do it again and in
some<00:02:34.050> I'm<00:02:34.140> gonna<00:02:34.290> go<00:02:34.470> three<00:02:35.070> six<00:02:36.060> nine<00:02:36.560> eight
