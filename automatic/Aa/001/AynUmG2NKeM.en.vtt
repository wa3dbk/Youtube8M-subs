your hands since you guys were actually
underwater<00:01:26.190> now<00:01:26.880> from<00:01:27.210> here<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.540> guys<00:01:27.690> could

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
underwater now from here you guys could

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.080 
underwater now from here you guys could
go<00:01:27.990> on<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.320> any<00:01:28.500> slope<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.130> then<00:01:29.250> walk<00:01:29.520> now<00:01:30.060> I

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
go on to any slope and then walk now I

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.940 
go on to any slope and then walk now I
went<00:01:30.480> on<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.630> two<00:01:30.930> small<00:01:31.290> slope<00:01:31.560> as<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.830> guys

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
went on a two small slope as you guys

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.500 
went on a two small slope as you guys
can<00:01:32.130> see<00:01:32.190> I<00:01:32.310> was<00:01:32.490> still<00:01:32.700> walking<00:01:32.970> in<00:01:33.240> midair

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
can see I was still walking in midair

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.540 
can see I was still walking in midair
but<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.140> slope<00:01:34.380> was<00:01:34.530> too<00:01:34.800> small<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.310> kind

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
but the slope was too small and I kind

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.460 
but the slope was too small and I kind
of<00:01:35.610> went<00:01:35.730> into<00:01:35.910> the<00:01:36.090> water<00:01:36.300> so<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.810> went<00:01:37.020> back<00:01:37.110> up

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
of went into the water so I went back up

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.710 
of went into the water so I went back up
the<00:01:37.620> slope<00:01:37.770> um<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.640> higher<00:01:38.970> point<00:01:39.330> of<00:01:39.600> the

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
the slope um to a higher point of the

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.510 
the slope um to a higher point of the
slope<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.110> then<00:01:40.230> I<00:01:40.260> started<00:01:40.650> going<00:01:41.190> towards

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
slope and then I started going towards

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.070 
slope and then I started going towards
the<00:01:41.610> water<00:01:41.850> now<00:01:42.330> it's<00:01:42.450> actually<00:01:42.840> walking

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
the water now it's actually walking

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.530 
the water now it's actually walking
above<00:01:43.620> the<00:01:43.800> water<00:01:44.010> you<00:01:44.370> guys<00:01:44.550> can<00:01:44.820> see<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.450> if

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
above the water you guys can see so if

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.120 
above the water you guys can see so if
you<00:01:45.630> guys<00:01:45.780> go<00:01:45.990> on<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.260> highest<00:01:46.470> slope<00:01:46.890> in<00:01:47.040> the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
you guys go on the highest slope in the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.560 
you guys go on the highest slope in the
game<00:01:47.310> for<00:01:47.520> example<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.060> guys<00:01:48.240> will<00:01:48.450> be

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
game for example you guys will be

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.660 
game for example you guys will be
walking<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:49.470> high<00:01:49.710> but<00:01:49.980> this<00:01:50.190> is<00:01:50.340> kind<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.580> a

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
walking that high but this is kind of a

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.310 
walking that high but this is kind of a
small<00:01:50.940> slope<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:51.450> I'm<00:01:51.510> kind<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.810> walking<00:01:52.050> on

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
small slope so I'm kind of walking on

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.260 
small slope so I'm kind of walking on
water<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:53.250> with<00:01:53.370> this<00:01:53.460> glitch<00:01:53.730> you<00:01:53.850> guys<00:01:54.030> could

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
water so with this glitch you guys could

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.820 
water so with this glitch you guys could
regulate<00:01:54.570> how<00:01:54.930> high<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.200> guys<00:01:55.410> want<00:01:55.650> to<00:01:55.710> be

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
regulate how high you guys want to be

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.680 
regulate how high you guys want to be
walking<00:01:56.040> in<00:01:56.310> midair<00:01:56.610> another<00:01:57.360> funny<00:01:57.600> thing

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
walking in midair another funny thing

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.030 
walking in midair another funny thing
about<00:01:57.870> this<00:01:58.230> glitch<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.530> if<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.860> guys

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
about this glitch is if you guys

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.560 
about this glitch is if you guys
actually<00:01:59.280> walk<00:01:59.670> your<00:01:59.880> character<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.300> gonna<00:02:00.480> be

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
actually walk your character is gonna be

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.270 
actually walk your character is gonna be
walking<00:02:00.960> pretty<00:02:01.170> funny<00:02:01.470> so<00:02:01.860> that's<00:02:02.010> one<00:02:02.250> way

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
correctly now how to get underneath the

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.160 
correctly now how to get underneath the
map<00:02:06.090> is<00:02:06.300> what<00:02:06.450> I'm<00:02:06.540> going<00:02:06.720> to<00:02:06.780> be<00:02:06.840> showing<00:02:07.020> you

guys right now so come over to this

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.790 
guys right now so come over to this
point<00:02:09.269> on<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.660> map<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:10.080> this<00:02:10.170> little<00:02:10.350> mountain

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
point on the map to this little mountain

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.309 
point on the map to this little mountain
and<00:02:10.979> then<00:02:11.340> just<00:02:11.520> keep<00:02:11.700> on<00:02:11.910> walking<00:02:11.940> up<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:12.720> so

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
and then just keep on walking up it so

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
so you guys can just walk towards the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.090 
so you guys can just walk towards the

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
bridge and that's the exact type the

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.590 
bridge and that's the exact type the
bridges<00:02:17.400> at<00:02:17.580> so<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.060> guys<00:02:18.150> will<00:02:18.360> walk<00:02:18.570> in

bridges at so you guys will walk in

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.150 
bridges at so you guys will walk in
midair<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.140> then<00:02:19.260> wallbreach<00:02:19.650> underneath

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
midair and then wallbreach underneath

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.380 
midair and then wallbreach underneath
the<00:02:20.280> bridge<00:02:20.460> then<00:02:20.910> you<00:02:21.000> guys<00:02:21.120> will<00:02:21.270> be

the bridge then you guys will be
underneath<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.990> map<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.350> you<00:02:22.410> guys<00:02:22.530> could

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
underneath the map and you guys could

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.080 
underneath the map and you guys could
pretty<00:02:22.950> much<00:02:23.070> go<00:02:23.370> wherever<00:02:23.580> you<00:02:23.760> guys<00:02:23.910> would
