is a fits on a de couro wall switch what

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.560 
is a fits on a de couro wall switch what
another<00:00:23.039> nice<00:00:23.279> feature<00:00:23.520> with<00:00:23.970> they<00:00:24.240> have<00:00:24.359> with

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
another nice feature with they have with

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.509 
another nice feature with they have with
the<00:00:24.660> Q<00:00:24.839> motion<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.529> that<00:00:25.589> they<00:00:25.830> have<00:00:26.009> a<00:00:26.039> wand

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
the Q motion is that they have a wand

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.099 
the Q motion is that they have a wand
here<00:00:26.789> that<00:00:26.939> can<00:00:27.060> activate<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.660> motor<00:00:27.900> so<00:00:28.079> you

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
here that can activate the motor so you

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.499 
here that can activate the motor so you
can<00:00:28.259> use<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.499> remote<00:00:28.650> or<00:00:29.579> the<00:00:29.849> one<00:00:30.060> behind<00:00:30.329> the

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:30.509 
can use the remote or the one behind the

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:31.609 
can use the remote or the one behind the
thing<00:00:30.659> and<00:00:30.839> all<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.019> really<00:00:31.169> do<00:00:31.349> with<00:00:31.499> this

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
thing and all you really do with this

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.200 
thing and all you really do with this
it's<00:00:31.829> a<00:00:31.890> real<00:00:32.040> simple<00:00:32.189> operation<00:00:32.700> just<00:00:32.880> go

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
it's a real simple operation just go

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.400 
it's a real simple operation just go
ahead<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.420> push<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.630> up<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.320> it

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
ahead and push it up and it

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.500 
ahead and push it up and it
automatically<00:00:34.980> engages<00:00:35.400> the<00:00:35.640> motor<00:00:35.880> now<00:00:36.420> if

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
automatically engages the motor now if

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.060 
automatically engages the motor now if
you<00:00:36.630> look<00:00:36.810> closely<00:00:36.960> at<00:00:37.410> this<00:00:37.560> you<00:00:37.739> can<00:00:37.860> see

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
you look closely at this you can see

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.099 
you look closely at this you can see
that<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.370> Rings<00:00:38.640> are<00:00:38.850> traveling<00:00:39.600> across<00:00:39.810> that

00:00:40.099 --> 00:00:40.109 
that the Rings are traveling across that

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:42.770 
that the Rings are traveling across that
crisscross<00:00:40.649> path<00:00:41.070> on<00:00:41.520> top<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.570> drapery

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
crisscross path on top of the drapery

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.510 
crisscross path on top of the drapery
right<00:00:43.109> now<00:00:43.530> this<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.920> battery<00:00:44.370> operated

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
right now this is the battery operated

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.009 
right now this is the battery operated
motor<00:00:45.180> okay

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:46.019 
motor okay

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:48.020 
motor okay
it<00:00:46.320> comes<00:00:46.559> in<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.739> one<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.160> half<00:00:47.370> inch<00:00:47.699> and<00:00:47.940> a

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
it comes in a one and a half inch and a

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.259 
it comes in a one and a half inch and a
2<00:00:48.059> inch<00:00:48.449> -<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:48.930> can<00:00:49.079> span<00:00:49.289> up<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.530> 14<00:00:50.039> feet<00:00:50.370> 11

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:51.269 
2 inch - you can span up to 14 feet 11

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:53.779 
2 inch - you can span up to 14 feet 11
foot<00:00:51.480> without<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.750> center<00:00:52.109> support<00:00:52.699> you<00:00:53.699> can

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
foot without a center support you can

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.060 
foot without a center support you can
also<00:00:53.969> open<00:00:54.329> operate<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.870> with<00:00:55.019> the<00:00:55.199> remote<00:00:55.559> and

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
also open operate it with the remote and

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.450 
also open operate it with the remote and
you<00:00:56.730> can<00:00:56.910> keep<00:00:57.120> be<00:00:57.359> able<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:58.399> two-second<00:00:59.399> delay

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
you can keep be able to two-second delay

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.919 
you can keep be able to two-second delay
there<00:00:59.730> finish<00:00:59.910> up<00:01:00.089> I'm<00:01:00.359> gonna<00:01:00.449> right<00:01:00.629> channel

00:01:00.919 --> 00:01:00.929 
there finish up I'm gonna right channel

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:06.200 
there finish up I'm gonna right channel
so<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.190> multi<00:01:02.609> channel<00:01:02.640> remote<00:01:05.180> so<00:01:06.180> I

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
so this is a multi channel remote so I

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.540 
so this is a multi channel remote so I
can<00:01:06.420> operate<00:01:06.870> it<00:01:06.960> with<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.260> remote<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.860> it'll

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
can operate it with the remote and it'll

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.830 
can operate it with the remote and it'll
go<00:01:08.670> up<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.060> now<00:01:09.120> once<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.390> come<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:09.660> take<00:01:09.810> a

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
go up and now once you come in take a

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.540 
go up and now once you come in take a
closer<00:01:10.140> look<00:01:10.410> at<00:01:10.560> some<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:10.890> rod<00:01:11.190> here<00:01:11.430> so

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
closer look at some of this rod here so

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:12.590 
closer look at some of this rod here so
you<00:01:11.610> can<00:01:11.700> actually<00:01:11.730> see<00:01:12.210> how<00:01:12.420> they've

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
you can actually see how they've

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.630 
you can actually see how they've
designed<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:13.979> it's<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.159> very<00:01:14.460> unique

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
designed this so it's a very unique

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.910 
designed this so it's a very unique
system<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.299> motor<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.840> actually<00:01:16.049> inside

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
system so the motor is actually inside

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.730 
system so the motor is actually inside
of<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.610> rod<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.180> as<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.840> rotates<00:01:19.110> the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
of the rod and as it rotates the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.190 
of the rod and as it rotates the
carrier's<00:01:20.490> slide<00:01:20.880> across<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.540> grooves<00:01:21.869> and

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
carrier's slide across the grooves and

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.859 
carrier's slide across the grooves and
then<00:01:22.829> with<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.070> unique<00:01:23.520> crisscross<00:01:24.090> design

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
then with this unique crisscross design

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.020 
then with this unique crisscross design
there<00:01:25.350> are<00:01:25.500> no<00:01:25.710> cords<00:01:26.159> or<00:01:26.310> pulls<00:01:26.579> to<00:01:26.759> do<00:01:26.880> this

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
there are no cords or pulls to do this

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.700 
there are no cords or pulls to do this
the<00:01:27.240> rings<00:01:27.450> carry<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.200> they<00:01:28.259> travel

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
the rings carry this and they travel

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.889 
the rings carry this and they travel
across<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:29.159> top<00:01:29.399> part<00:01:29.670> here<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.180> so<00:01:30.720> that's

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
across this top part here and so that's

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:32.420 
across this top part here and so that's
how<00:01:31.049> this<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.380> your<00:01:31.560> finials<00:01:31.979> again<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:32.369> I'm

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
how this so your finials again so I'm

gonna go ahead and just activate this
shade<00:01:33.780> again<00:01:34.049> watch<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:35.009> rod<00:01:35.220> watch<00:01:35.759> how<00:01:35.970> it

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
shade again watch the rod watch how it

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.160 
shade again watch the rod watch how it
moves<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.390> I'm<00:01:36.450> good<00:01:36.630> I'm<00:01:36.780> just<00:01:36.960> going<00:01:37.110> to

like<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:41.159> just<00:01:41.219> watch<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.549> lead

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:41.969 
like that and just watch that lead

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:44.389 
like that and just watch that lead
carrier<00:01:42.479> travel<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.140> along<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:43.740> everything<00:01:44.219> is

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
carrier travel it along so everything is

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.940 
carrier travel it along so everything is
is<00:01:44.640> pushed<00:01:45.360> off<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:45.719> lead<00:01:45.960> carrier<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.619> then

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
is pushed off that lead carrier and then

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.530 
is pushed off that lead carrier and then
all<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.250> other<00:01:47.430> rings<00:01:47.759> just<00:01:48.090> follow<00:01:48.299> behind

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
all the other rings just follow behind

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.070 
all the other rings just follow behind
it

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.260 

and<00:01:53.080> again<00:01:53.320> this<00:01:53.470> is<00:01:53.650> the<00:01:53.800> q<00:01:54.160> motion<00:01:54.700> drapery
