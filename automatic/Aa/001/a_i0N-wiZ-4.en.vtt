00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:24.060
 the world a platform is a platform 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.220
 technology that enables a 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.960
 besides being used as an online course 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.760
 in the case of the classroom and enables 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.349
 an in-class classroom expansion 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.660
 allows the student to look for other sources 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.130
 besides we allow the students to discuss 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.210
 between them allows for a very 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.430
 important to help build the 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.399
 knowledge makes it clear from a 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.160
 way to hotter because she does not 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.140
 it is more of a passive consumer it can 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.910
 active and he has to be active for the 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.170
 platform works well 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.360
 the student interacts changes using the 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.690
 open the forum it can 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.190
 also interact through the 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.500
 construction of world texts allows 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.350
 a construction of texts in collectives 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.570
 between students then allows one to 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.720
 collective construction not only to me, not 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.840
 In case I end up guiding but the students 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.880
 can build independent of a 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.210
 fixed position of the teacher mechanisms 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.909
 I can use the forums and it's 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.740
 As far as I can, I can evaluate the 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.270
 note in the forums where they participate in 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.570
 questions are thrown where the students 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.060
 discuss and can be evaluated are they 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.560
 also allow an online test is 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.930
 possible to make a test using 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.780
 videos one thing that is not possible 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.270
 traditional proof of paper nor using the 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.950
 videos he can discuss on top of 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.420
 videos and can be evaluated after the 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.790
 advantage that they receive the note 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.619
 so the river and can access the note 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.740
 from anywhere in the living room 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.659
 of their own interval at school 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.079
 then both possibilities are very 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:58.140
 the student has him with his 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.490
 profile has changed I can know the 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.229
 activities you attended the time you 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.020
 The time came when he left when he 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.119
 finish the task and you can tell if 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.009
 delivered late or not so it can 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.259
 send in questions I can respond to 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.720
 doubts it is possible for example as 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.670
 ends up causing him to send an activity 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.590
 activity activity look is not cool 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.780
 for the comment he returns home 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.200
 see arranges human activity again 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.180
 until the note is better or until it 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.370
 achieve better performance and allows 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.519
 This and I can tabulate the data 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.940
 geographical can store this data 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:35.610
 which makes it possible to calculate the average 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.379
 there are many possibilities super pro 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.569
 truth is an issues manager does not 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.730
 is that has been around for a long time 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.400
 several teachers are already using the 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.709
 superpop is a question manager 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.540
 which have around 100 thousand questions of the 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.579
 major vestibular exams I think 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.859
 the whole of Brazil and the memory of 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:55.139
 teachers made a super fit for 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:57.780
 to be able to produce evidence 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:59.069
 and I began to make use of myself and 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.349
 also to produce lists of 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.030
 exercises to produce other materials 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.700
 to be used other than a 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.379
 normal assessment n evaluation of the test 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.690
 simulated this type of evaluation 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:13.260
 this tool is worked from the following 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.970
 I can do this in the production of 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.370
 lists of exercises in your lists 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.319
 which are replacing the masses 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.870
 paper exercises that the learner takes 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:25.049
 home made that great content of 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.030
 exercise is the idea of replacing 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.889
 this paper material has a 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.470
 virtual material already decreasing 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:33.660
 so excessively the impression of 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.329
 role already has this important side 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.569
 and I have a different 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:42.389
 process of solving the exercises 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:44.790
 because then I have effective results and 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:47.519
 has a database that gives me what the 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.949
 information on the percentage of 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.349
 arrangement in which room having a performance 

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:54.690
 better than the other with this fight but there 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.519
 who within the results and next it 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.519
 can you please give a 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:02.069
 vision of how my group of students 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:04.650
 really lies at the moment of 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:07.769
 activity within the lesson of 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.379
 And it's not me, I do not have to wait for 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.530
 evidence the reviews to get a sense 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:14.209
 how is the class in relation to 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.959
 dominated content so I do not have one 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:19.880
 excel spreadsheet I get is 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.680
 gather data on student performance in the 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.550
 monthly proof of bimonthly proof of 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.370
 simulated 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.900
 these data give me a diagnosis of 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.370
 How is the student's performance? 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.980
 what are his difficulties in 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.700
 skills and contents and from these 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.460
 data 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.230
 I try to do some interventions 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.520
 positive effects that improve the 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.310
 student learning 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.419
 and that 's who works on recovery for 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.480
 to present such data more 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:46.550
 detail in the recovery is makes a 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.460
 parallel between these data that I have collected 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.140
 and what the student perceives of the ability 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.030
 his knowledge begins to 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.530
 understand what skills and 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.600
 which he has to study 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:00.110
 plus which he has to train more to 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:02.240
 I better get some 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.970
 students have difficulty in establishing 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.490
 cause-and-effect relationships with 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:10.280
 content that elaborates an issue 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.139
 exercises passes a monitor and monitor 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.660
 will work this out of hours with 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:15.290
 those students that I determined is to go 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.600
 to work 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.250
 so I work together with the parents too. 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.410
 the income of the parents present the 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.340
 worksheets and work also during the 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.200
 class council 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.630
 when we discuss the situation of the 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.940
 student in the learning and learning 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.320
 use these worksheets to submit to 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.289
 which are the main 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.960
 difficulties of the students and if what I 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:38.750
 do I try to use the diagnosis that 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.180
 I do with the spreadsheet and transform 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.630
 this in action that improves the ability to 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.630
 learning
