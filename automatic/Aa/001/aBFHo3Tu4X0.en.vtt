00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.250
 it's a motor racing bicycle, remember the movie that went crazy 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.849
 June on yutub suggested that fabian cancellara had used me 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:23.170
 a similar to win the tour of the Flanders Paris lube he denied 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:27.259
 but it seems that some other professional b used we have 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:29.069
 could try it 

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:33.390
 some data to have a point of reference I am 49 and a half years like 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.760
 you see I am at least 10 min and overweight but I train regularly 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.750
 from the beginning of this year put together at 8 thousand kilometers and now we see that 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.540
 what can this bike do? 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.780
 now they are 30 kilometers an hour 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.380
 frequency 103 portion naz. let's see what 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.680
 practically unchanged mass frequency 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.190
 Won earned 4 kilometers per hour 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.360
 we are 39 then 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.360
 the fragrance begins to rise we make it go to the motor 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.510
 the impression is disappointing the yield is good and regimes lower when yes 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.090
 pedal all the help and the minimum is also said that the engine we have 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.960
 used delivers up to 160 watts of power but can go up to 300 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.130
 practically double 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.640
 just change a city card to activate it if you press the button 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.710
 hidden under the bomb that covers the brake levers 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.700
 it makes a lot of noise but if you want that too you can eliminate it 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.570
 battery 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.899
 and inside a water bottle and has more than 50 minutes of autonomy 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.490
 in short, there are those who cannot be seen but are easy to discover 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.430
 all see the bottle because 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.430
 yes no too much poplars two goats 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.670
 you notice that Luke Betti is the age the battery transmits to the control unit 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.730
 use it for a race therefore very very risky besides who sells it keeps to 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.870
 specify that the bike will reach the customer with a 200 watt motor and with 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.630
 that noise that makes it immediately recognizable 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.509
 who then will eventually change it will do it at his own risk and 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:05.210
 danger 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.960
 the idea of ​​producing it in series came to David Boifava 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.779
 bon runner in the 70s 

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:13.779
 he is a great sports director in the 80s and 90s when he drove battalions 

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:18.889
 visentiini lipsticks in pucci and pantani the basic model cost 8000 euros are 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:20.620
 already ordered 50 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.299
 the first four will be delivered in December a bike for those who have a certain 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.930
 age but not for those who want to stay behind the most trained friends or for whom 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.029
 he wants to have fun making fun of his fellow travelers 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:32.509
 however eye the bottle
