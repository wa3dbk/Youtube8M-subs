verse one time when I was like this
guy's<00:02:23.530> another<00:02:23.800> level<00:02:24.010> yeah<00:02:24.519> so<00:02:24.819> yeah<00:02:25.660> I've

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
guy's another level yeah so yeah I've

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
seen it

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.750 
seen it
Oh<00:02:26.290> was<00:02:26.590> that<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.769> one<00:02:26.980> where<00:02:27.130> you<00:02:27.220> go<00:02:27.340> a

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
Oh was that the one where you go a

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.120 
Oh was that the one where you go a
little<00:02:28.300> deeper<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:28.810> yeah<00:02:29.019> we<00:02:29.620> actually<00:02:29.920> tried

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
little deeper and yeah we actually tried

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.710 
little deeper and yeah we actually tried
to<00:02:30.160> recreate<00:02:30.670> that<00:02:30.940> about<00:02:31.150> that<00:02:31.360> goal<00:02:31.540> in

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.710 
to recreate that about that goal in
particular<00:02:32.200> yeah<00:02:32.410> I<00:02:32.650> could<00:02:33.220> see<00:02:33.340> why<00:02:33.720> Cole

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
particular yeah I could see why Cole

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.110 
particular yeah I could see why Cole
went<00:02:35.170> through<00:02:37.590> okay<00:02:38.590> so<00:02:38.650> Gareth<00:02:38.980> you<00:02:39.220> might

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
went through okay so Gareth you might

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.180 
went through okay so Gareth you might
not<00:02:40.239> be<00:02:40.330> using<00:02:40.480> my<00:02:40.750> footage<00:02:41.140> per<00:02:41.319> se<00:02:41.530> but<00:02:41.590> what

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
not be using my footage per se but what

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.250 
not be using my footage per se but what
happens<00:02:42.519> to<00:02:42.640> X<00:02:42.730> I<00:02:42.880> do<00:02:42.940> you<00:02:43.090> capture<00:02:43.299> not<00:02:44.049> wait

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
happens to X I do you capture not wait

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.949 
happens to X I do you capture not wait
so<00:02:44.890> what<00:02:45.700> happens<00:02:46.090> is<00:02:46.269> there's<00:02:46.569> a<00:02:46.630> team<00:02:46.810> of

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
so what happens is there's a team of

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.750 
so what happens is there's a team of
guys<00:02:47.080> who<00:02:47.410> take<00:02:47.650> this<00:02:47.830> data<00:02:48.069> and<00:02:48.370> they<00:02:48.519> solve

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
guys who take this data and they solve

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.479 
guys who take this data and they solve
it<00:02:49.000> to<00:02:49.209> our<00:02:49.540> player<00:02:49.900> model<00:02:50.260> and<00:02:50.470> then<00:02:51.190> it<00:02:51.340> goes

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
it to our player model and then it goes

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.360 
it to our player model and then it goes
to<00:02:51.519> a<00:02:51.760> team<00:02:52.030> of<00:02:52.180> animators<00:02:53.099> in<00:02:54.099> the<00:02:54.250> other

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
to a team of animators in the other

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.089 
to a team of animators in the other
building<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:54.970> they<00:02:55.870> basically<00:02:56.530> edit<00:02:56.860> that

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
building and they basically edit that

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.780 
building and they basically edit that
animation<00:02:57.790> into<00:02:58.599> sort<00:02:58.840> of<00:02:58.870> small<00:02:59.280> chunks<00:03:00.280> and

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
animation into sort of small chunks and

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.740 
animation into sort of small chunks and
they<00:03:01.690> and<00:03:02.200> then<00:03:02.709> with<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.549> help<00:03:03.670> of<00:03:03.819> colors<00:03:04.209> we

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
they and then with the help of colors we

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.900 
they and then with the help of colors we
figure<00:03:05.019> out<00:03:05.049> how<00:03:05.410> to<00:03:05.470> code<00:03:06.310> that<00:03:08.730> how<00:03:09.730> many

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
figure out how to code that how many

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.520 
figure out how to code that how many
people<00:03:10.180> are<00:03:10.299> involved<00:03:10.569> in<00:03:10.840> this<00:03:11.049> um<00:03:11.230> it<00:03:11.380> must

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
people are involved in this um it must

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.250 
people are involved in this um it must
be<00:03:11.620> in<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.069> larvae<00:03:12.430> army<00:03:12.850> of<00:03:12.940> people<00:03:13.260> well

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
be in the larvae army of people well

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.759 
be in the larvae army of people well
let's<00:03:14.470> see<00:03:15.600> how<00:03:16.600> many<00:03:16.810> guys<00:03:16.930> are<00:03:17.139> in<00:03:17.170> mocap<00:03:17.590> I'm

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
let's see how many guys are in mocap I'm

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.069 
let's see how many guys are in mocap I'm
not<00:03:17.950> sure<00:03:18.130> that's<00:03:18.310> broccoli<00:03:18.819> it's<00:03:19.720> probably

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
not sure that's broccoli it's probably

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:21.900 
not sure that's broccoli it's probably
like<00:03:20.260> 5<00:03:20.470> or<00:03:20.500> 10<00:03:20.739> people<00:03:20.920> down<00:03:21.190> here<00:03:21.370> help<00:03:21.790> us
