00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.720 

same<00:00:44.160> sort<00:00:44.580> of

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.750 

and<00:00:49.120> risks<00:00:49.450> and<00:00:50.079> ever

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.360 

all<00:00:55.030> the<00:00:55.149> way<00:00:55.300> down

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.850 

and<00:00:58.580> so<00:00:58.730> that's<00:00:58.910> a<00:00:59.000> very<00:00:59.240> different<00:01:00.020> way<00:01:00.560> than

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
and so that's a very different way than

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.290 
and so that's a very different way than
you<00:01:00.890> would<00:01:01.040> find<00:01:01.220> in<00:01:01.430> a<00:01:01.460> biological<00:01:02.180> system

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
you would find in a biological system

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.610 
you would find in a biological system
