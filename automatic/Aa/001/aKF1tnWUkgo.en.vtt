00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
which is criticized a lot at the moment

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.940 
which is criticized a lot at the moment
but<00:02:49.850> we<00:02:50.090> shouldn't<00:02:50.510> forget<00:02:50.690> we<00:02:51.530> have<00:02:51.680> plenty

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
but we shouldn't forget we have plenty

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.250 
but we shouldn't forget we have plenty
of<00:02:52.100> good<00:02:52.310> players<00:02:52.520> abroad<00:02:52.910> now<00:02:53.150> that<00:02:53.630> can<00:02:53.960> and

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260

will play with the national team
I<00:02:56.300> think<00:02:57.050> it's<00:02:57.170> possible<00:02:57.620> because<00:02:57.830> everybody

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
I think it's possible because everybody

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.930 
I think it's possible because everybody
wants<00:02:59.000> it<00:02:59.180> the<00:02:59.750> players<00:03:00.020> and<00:03:00.350> the<00:03:00.650> fans<00:03:00.940> people

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
wants it the players and the fans people

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.180 
wants it the players and the fans people
think<00:03:02.180> that<00:03:02.360> it's<00:03:02.510> easy<00:03:02.750> to<00:03:02.960> be<00:03:03.080> champions<00:03:03.650> but

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
think that it's easy to be champions but

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.790 
think that it's easy to be champions but
it's<00:03:04.400> not<00:03:04.670> obviously<00:03:05.570> it's<00:03:05.870> not<00:03:06.170> easy<00:03:06.380> to<00:03:06.680> be

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
it's not obviously it's not easy to be

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.960 
it's not obviously it's not easy to be
the<00:03:06.920> champions<00:03:07.340> of<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:07.490> world

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
the champions of the world

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.340 
the champions of the world
but<00:03:08.630> this<00:03:08.810> squad<00:03:09.200> really<00:03:09.890> wants<00:03:10.190> it
