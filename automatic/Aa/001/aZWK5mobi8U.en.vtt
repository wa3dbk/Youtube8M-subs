00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:36.559
 Oh dear 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:41.520
 It is equipped with this new generation 4 as a standard, but 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:46.170
 I thought i was going to buy this time 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:50.460
 I bought this and I couldn't find anything else 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:56.610
 So I lost my money this time 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:58.590
 I was thinking about making it for a while, so I made this one when I made it. 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.079
 Want to think 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.960
 Well in So yes 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.710
 Ne 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:11.420
 It looks like this when viewed from the front 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:18.790
 Another such it's Well big and surprising 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:25.840
 It may look pretty small, but it's still in the back 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:29.010
 The back side is like this The back side was also quite good 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.080
 Let's take a look at high Sai Wuhan 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.890
 First of all, here it is here 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.280
 Yes 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:43.700
 First saw people noticed some people Kamozo 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:47.930
 I'm sorry but this is different from selling from coming port 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:52.820
 There 's no source here . 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:02:00.049
 It's just so simple that it was bothersome to make 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:02:03.690
 But it hurts me to say that it is just making it bothersome to make it 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:06.870
 Kotoden that this time will be left 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:10.229
 I Well grip has so become 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:13.349
 It is quite square and 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:18.590
 No trigger yes 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:21.590
 In another well was unlucky I Well Well I'd thought I won 1 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:25.310
 Yeah I thought I got into another 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:28.879
 And this is heavy but 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.910
 It is likely to put a part of this house 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:33.490
 Yes 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:38.410
 Yes here it is Yano part 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:44.190
 I worked very hard here, but I am modeling + 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:50.400
 And I forgot the tension here or the paint is Sneka 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:54.510
 It's not here, but here is the place I did my best 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:03:00.530
 Here actually this marketed 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:03.380
 It is possible to set this lock seed, but it is also such a feature 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:09.130
 It is described in the after 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:13.640

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:17.700
 Well 9 and one of it pretty ordinary 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:22.580
 I did it, but it took quite a while 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.420
 I still think I'm quite good 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.630
 Yes 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.630
 This is the man this time in So 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:32.210
 Slashing 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.250
 It is a bow and arrow that I can do it already 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:39.490
 Oh dear 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:41.900
 Well this is that I tried to make it here and I did not have a circle, so I made it this time. 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:45.709
 There is no sound, so 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:51.709
 After all it is only Zangi Kanfull but it is also true 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:55.510
 Bow draft Nekou - Well, not that it can not Maamu share because you go anyway Tteyuu is 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:04:02.060
 This time I was attached with a gimmick 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:04.470
 I 'm just saying I 'm pulling here and talking 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.500
 Pulling and pulling 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.000

 Yes it contains the following gimmick 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:59.759
 We use this woman's energy lock seed this time 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:12.350
 I will set it here 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.350
 I can do it 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.710
 Yes 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.120

 Do you understand yes? It is locked properly 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:29.740
 But is something funny I will not do it by being 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:32.440
 In the merchant Ne who did this here 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:35.050

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:42.840
 It says that it is loaded here, but in a voice 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.800
 It is quite over 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:49.990
 gimmick 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:54.400

 Closed Do Well really I'd think well understood to say I have stuck here 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:18.940
 You can not remove it just by all means 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:23.490
 Four 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.490

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:31.760
 Can be set 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.760
 You can also set this ordinary lock seed 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.090
 Yes 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.660

 Even in this state 

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:10.620
 As if I can not get it well 

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:13.500
 It is hard to come off 4 

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:18.780

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:21.530
