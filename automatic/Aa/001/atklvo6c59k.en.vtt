00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.219
 Welcome to the maritime world 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.390
 we want to give you the new ones today 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.550
 speakers from 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.700
 audio with the name elise 2 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.140
 Imagine being at first sight 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.160
 these speakers are not exactly 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.500
 out of the ordinary 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.310
 the speakers are not special 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.350
 big and yet not with enormous 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.200
 burning surface or a large number of 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.720
 drivers but that it is not 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.030
 fooling with the elise 2 is progressive 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.370
 audio a very special speaker 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.130
 succeeded the manufacturer progressive 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.380
 audio is a small manufactory 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.140
 Germany more specifically from Essen 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.690
 the owner and chief developer can 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.780
 is an absolute fanatic and sound 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.949
 fancier technician that reflects 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.010
 also very clearly in the 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.809
 2 crisis features again this 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.809
 speakers are not optical 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.750
 design pieces of furniture but here has 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.020
 a technician every detail 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.850
 optimized physical aspects 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:16.650
 with these loudspeakers child very clear 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.900
 the motto form follows function 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.360
 paradigm of lord can at his 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.549
 development, it is the phase error in 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.670
 minimize the reproduction as much as possible 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.500
 the sound of the tweeter should 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.649
 absolutely coinciding with the sound 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.829
 the woofer at the ear of the listener 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:34.710
 arrive 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.439
 when reading two is this phase 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.479
 Error at below three degrees 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:41.909
 This accuracy will behave in time 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.000
 on the one hand achieved by the oblique 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.909
 arrangement of the two drivers as well 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.040
 he becomes deep midrange additionally 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.060
 by about 1 centimeter high 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.399
 distances moved forward 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.039
 as a result, the voice coil of the 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:03.509
 high and deep midrange on the 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:06.060
 same level of originally as out 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.360
 both shoots are equal 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:14.790
 removed from the ear of the listener and comes 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:17.150
 thus also at the same time at the Elise 2 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.190
 a two way bass reflex speaker 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.790
 The tweeter consists of an extremely 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.010
 rigid ceramic invers calotte with 30 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.879
 millimeter diameter and neodymium 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:33.510
 drive from the company thiel the deep 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:36.269
 midrange has 18 cm diameter and 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:40.830
 consists of a carbon fiber membrane and 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:43.290
 you can still see a magnesium corp here 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:50.400
 quite clearly the distance ring for 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:53.519
 phase balance another absolute 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.739
 special feature of the elite 2 is that 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:59.010
 Intentionality runs over the whole 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:02.129
 Frequency range almost constant at 7 above 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.730
 This is achieved by each 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:09.720
 frequency divider freely wired and thus 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.849
 individual linearization is added at 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.110
 This intention of correcting the dynamics 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.440
 not to suffer 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:19.830
 pay attention that the intention of the 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.830
 Correction always above the actual 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.989
 The sweetheart's impedance remains 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.989
 Tolerance between right and left box 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:31.590
 become due to this linearization 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:33.720
 an absolute minimum reduced by 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.170
 the complete linear balance sheet 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.900
 not only can these speakers with you 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.790
 amplifier boliden but also with 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.220
 smaller ems or even with 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.549
 tube amplifier easily operated 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.129
 the bass reflex channel is going down 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.819
 led back 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:52.709
 usually need 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.989
 floor standing speaker with back 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:58.819
 bass reflex channel a minimal 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:01.920
 Wall distance of about 40 to 50 cm 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.959
 these two, however, make it through 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.360
 the exact phase adaptation of the 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:09.239
 bassreflex canales to the front 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.360
 cassis that these speakers anyway 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:15.390
 converter can be set up 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:19.320
 perfect distance of only about 10 cm is enough 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:22.340
 at the Elise, the volume is perfect 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.710
 that this very compact speaker 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.810
 We are absolutely impressed 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.300
 hardly know a speaker from the 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.640
 such a small volume of resonance and 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.700
 a very small amount of fire 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.620
 huge bass still produced 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.050
 more impressive than the pure one 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.020
 Volume is the precision 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.430
 and the impuls friendliness of the bass 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.930
 this is also confirmed by the trade magazine 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:50.849
 stereo play in its edition 6 2012 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.310
 confirms and says that the impuls 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:55.460
 Play these two of the best 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.770
 is that ever been measured 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:04.979
 the connection terminals from the day before are 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:07.729
 very stable and produces the housing 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:12.509
 The Elise 2 is not made of wood but 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:13.639
 from 20 mm thick black acrylic plates 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:16.800
 built up 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:20.129
 this material brings a pretty high 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.680
 inner dampen and very small own 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:24.150
 fray 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.210
 By default, these two are only in the 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.969
 color black high gloss offered but 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.969
 on request is also a version in 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:35.789
 white orderable 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:37.889
 our conclusion to the meadow 2 we still have 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:41.370
 never a speaker with such compact 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:44.490
 the dimensions of both dimensions and plastic 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:47.310
 Sounds the fine resolution is awesome and 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.710
 nevertheless it does not act aggressively or 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:53.659
 intrusive but over the whole 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:56.759
 Frequency range extremely well balanced 

00:05:53.659 --> 00:06:00.060
 the stage that conjures the meadow two 

00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:02.990
 is huge and not only allows 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:06.150
 a horizontal but a very clear one 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:09.180
 vertical differentiation of the individual 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:12.599
 instruments and an almost unique 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:14.849
 room depth we have in this 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:17.520
 Price range so far no 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:20.060
 loudspeakers are so natural 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.770
 sounds and has inspired us all so much 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.710
 We invite you to listen 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:27.810
 the two of us join us 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:30.330
 you should definitely not one 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:32.340
 speakers in the price range 54 and 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:36.770
 Buy 5000 euro apiece before you 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.770
 is this two once even profited
