information<00:00:24.769> it's<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.830> very<00:00:26.039> good<00:00:26.160> lure<00:00:26.369> I

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
information it's a very good lure I

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.169 
information it's a very good lure I
found<00:00:27.539> using<00:00:27.960> sense<00:00:28.740> isn't<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.580> best<00:00:29.730> on<00:00:30.029> it

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
found using sense isn't the best on it

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.999 
found using sense isn't the best on it
because<00:00:30.480> unless<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.260> rubber<00:00:31.470> just<00:00:31.679> on<00:00:31.890> the

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
because unless you rubber just on the

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.990 
because unless you rubber just on the
hooks<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.550> sticks<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.630> spin<00:00:34.430> the<00:00:35.430> spin<00:00:35.880> on

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
hooks it sticks to the spin the spin on

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.150 
hooks it sticks to the spin the spin on
it<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.750> will<00:00:36.899> drag<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.469> snag<00:00:37.829> really

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
it and it will drag and snag really

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.310 
it and it will drag and snag really
easily<00:00:38.430> but<00:00:38.700> if<00:00:39.180> you're<00:00:39.420> running<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.899> bear<00:00:40.110> with

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
easily but if you're running a bear with

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.889 
easily but if you're running a bear with
no<00:00:40.430> nothing<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.760> know<00:00:41.879> hurt<00:00:42.690> its

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
no nothing to you know hurt its

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.110 
no nothing to you know hurt its
performance<00:00:43.469> then<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.950> works<00:00:44.160> really<00:00:44.489> well<00:00:44.789> I

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
performance then it works really well I

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.040 
performance then it works really well I
found<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.690> doesn't<00:00:45.960> like<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.200> snag<00:00:46.760> it<00:00:47.760> uh<00:00:48.050> it

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
found it doesn't like to snag it uh it

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.380 
found it doesn't like to snag it uh it
looks<00:00:49.410> like<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.590> tree<00:00:50.039> like<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:51.000> corner<00:00:51.300> of

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
looks like a tree like in the corner of

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.569 
looks like a tree like in the corner of
the<00:00:51.449> mouth<00:00:51.600> majority<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.770> time<00:00:52.949> with<00:00:53.219> all

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
the mouth majority of the time with all

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.490 
the mouth majority of the time with all
my<00:00:53.640> catches<00:00:54.210> with<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.510> I've<00:00:54.750> used<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.469> in

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
my catches with it I've used it in

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.410 
my catches with it I've used it in
really<00:00:55.680> bad<00:00:55.860> conditions<00:00:56.550> like<00:00:56.820> where<00:00:57.390> I

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
really bad conditions like where I

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.670 
really bad conditions like where I
thought<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.690> wouldn't<00:00:57.870> catch<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.230> fish<00:00:58.469> the

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
thought I wouldn't catch a fish the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.470 
thought I wouldn't catch a fish the
whole<00:00:58.829> day<00:00:59.010> I've<00:00:59.190> used<00:00:59.399> other<00:00:59.520> lures<00:00:59.879> on<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.120> day

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.650 
whole day I've used other lures on a day
and<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.620> only<00:01:01.770> one<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.100> would<00:01:02.160> work

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
and this is the only one that would work

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.240 
and this is the only one that would work
it<00:01:03.660> just<00:01:03.989> seems<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.350> attract<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.769> fish<00:01:05.040> really

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
it just seems to attract the fish really

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.410 
it just seems to attract the fish really
well<00:01:06.920> I've<00:01:07.920> used<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.520> variety<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:09.119> areas

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
and the sort of green design with the

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.620 
and the sort of green design with the
white<00:01:14.520> bottom<00:01:14.760> bid<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.750> really<00:01:16.140> found<00:01:16.409> in

upstream they like to swim with the

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.609 
upstream they like to swim with the
currents<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.270> can<00:01:51.420> sort<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.630> just<00:01:51.840> sit<00:01:52.409> there

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
currents I can sort of just sit there

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.330
