California I just planted this tree here
what<00:00:10.080> you're<00:00:10.170> looking<00:00:10.410> at<00:00:10.530> is<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.650> core<00:00:11.040> in<00:00:11.190> one

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
what you're looking at is a core in one

what you're looking at is a core in one
cherry<00:00:11.790> tree<00:00:12.120> I<00:00:12.300> bought<00:00:13.080> it<00:00:13.320> I<00:00:13.559> planted<00:00:13.950> this

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
cherry tree I bought it I planted this

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.490 
cherry tree I bought it I planted this
thing<00:00:14.309> back<00:00:14.549> January<00:00:15.360> 15th

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
thing back January 15th

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.779 
thing back January 15th
so<00:00:16.800> it's<00:00:16.920> been<00:00:17.039> about<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.250> month<00:00:17.310> since<00:00:17.580> I

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
so it's been about a month since I

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.760 
so it's been about a month since I
planted<00:00:18.090> this<00:00:18.240> tree<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.539> planted<00:00:18.660> as<00:00:19.230> bare<00:00:19.529> root

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
planted this tree I planted as bare root

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.420 
planted this tree I planted as bare root
stock<00:00:20.240> where<00:00:21.240> root<00:00:21.510> basically<00:00:22.080> means<00:00:22.289> that<00:00:22.529> it

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
stock where root basically means that it

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.880 
stock where root basically means that it
came<00:00:23.699> with<00:00:23.730> no<00:00:24.300> leaves<00:00:24.600> on<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.080> just<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.710> piece

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
came with no leaves on it just a piece

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.609 
came with no leaves on it just a piece
of<00:00:26.070> just<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.519> stick<00:00:26.820> essentially<00:00:27.410> and<00:00:28.410> by<00:00:28.560> the

of just a stick essentially and by the
way<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:29.039> have<00:00:29.939> another<00:00:30.090> video<00:00:30.269> here<00:00:31.130> it's<00:00:32.660> about

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
way I have another video here it's about

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.229 
way I have another video here it's about
my<00:00:33.870> apple<00:00:34.739> tree<00:00:34.920> which<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.340> also<00:00:35.489> for<00:00:35.850> in<00:00:36.030> one

it's four in one which means there's

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.090 
it's four in one which means there's

and<00:00:47.670> Lapham's<00:00:48.480> cherry<00:00:48.980> which<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.160> very<00:00:50.340> great

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
and Lapham's cherry which is very great

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.830 
and Lapham's cherry which is very great
because<00:00:52.379> sweet<00:00:53.309> cherries<00:00:53.789> usually<00:00:54.660> need

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
because sweet cherries usually need

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.790 
because sweet cherries usually need
pollinators<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:56.129> become<00:00:56.910> fruitful<00:00:57.500> very<00:00:58.500> few

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
pollinators to become fruitful very few

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.439 
pollinators to become fruitful very few
varieties<00:00:58.949> are<00:00:59.340> self-fruitful<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.239> even

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
varieties are self-fruitful and even

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.750 
varieties are self-fruitful and even
when<00:01:00.539> they<00:01:00.629> are<00:01:00.660> they<00:01:00.930> don't<00:01:01.109> usually

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
when they are they don't usually

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.609 
when they are they don't usually
pollinate<00:01:02.760> very<00:01:02.969> efficiently<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:03.719> here<00:01:04.470> you

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
pollinate very efficiently so here you

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.429 
pollinate very efficiently so here you
have<00:01:04.799> four<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.339> one<00:01:05.810> which<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.840> going<00:01:07.320> to

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
have four in one which is going to

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.890 
have four in one which is going to
ensure<00:01:07.970> very<00:01:08.970> optimal<00:01:10.430> pollination<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:12.150> also

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
ensure very optimal pollination and also

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.570 
ensure very optimal pollination and also
take<00:01:13.080> up<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.320> very<00:01:13.350> small<00:01:13.560> amount<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.100> yard

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
take up a very small amount of yard

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.600 
take up a very small amount of yard
space<00:01:14.880> which<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:15.990> very<00:01:16.020> practical<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:17.009> let<00:01:17.520> me

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
space which is very practical so let me

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.700 
space which is very practical so let me
get<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.759> little<00:01:17.850> closer<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.360> actually<00:01:18.990> is

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
get a little closer this actually is

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.219 
get a little closer this actually is
starting<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.220> blue<00:01:20.850> uh<00:01:20.880> grow<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.900> little<00:01:22.110> bit

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
starting to blue uh grow a little bit

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.010 
starting to blue uh grow a little bit
I'll<00:01:22.560> try<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.400> zoom<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.759> here<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.180> can<00:01:24.720> see

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
I'll try to zoom in here you can see

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.850 
I'll try to zoom in here you can see
that<00:01:25.259> that's<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.650> lap<00:01:25.920> ins<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.960> lap<00:01:28.619> ins

cherry right there right here is the ex

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.020 
cherry right there right here is the ex
I<00:01:35.280> take<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.579> back

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
I take it back

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.429 
I take it back
