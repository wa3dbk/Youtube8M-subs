learning a lot of things and what was

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.310 
learning a lot of things and what was
this<00:01:20.950> experiment<00:01:21.640> herbal<00:01:22.000> this<00:01:22.870> little<00:01:23.170> thing

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
this experiment herbal this little thing

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.540 
this experiment herbal this little thing
is<00:01:23.500> called<00:01:23.890> a<00:01:24.070> BIOS<00:01:24.370> and<00:01:25.830> it's<00:01:26.830> a<00:01:26.950> very<00:01:27.160> simple

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
is called a BIOS and it's a very simple

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.720 
is called a BIOS and it's a very simple
device<00:01:27.730> that<00:01:27.880> can<00:01:28.180> be<00:01:28.300> constructed<00:01:29.730> anywhere

device that can be constructed anywhere
anytime<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:33.640> basic<00:01:34.000> principle<00:01:34.480> is<00:01:34.690> that<00:01:35.460> this

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
anytime the basic principle is that this

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.510 
anytime the basic principle is that this
is<00:01:36.580> a<00:01:36.610> layer<00:01:37.060> of<00:01:37.240> sand<00:01:37.450> and<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:39.100> pipe<00:01:39.310> is

and that layer of bacteria of breeds and

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.540 
and that layer of bacteria of breeds and
when<00:01:56.860> it<00:01:57.010> nurtures<00:01:57.760> itself<00:01:58.090> over<00:01:58.390> of<00:01:58.600> equal<00:01:59.110> to

when it nurtures itself over of equal to

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.070 
when it nurtures itself over of equal to
that<00:02:00.550> layer<00:02:00.730> of<00:02:00.790> bacteria<00:02:01.360> will<00:02:01.540> help<00:02:01.750> fight

that layer of bacteria will help fight

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.660 
that layer of bacteria will help fight

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
the rest of the bacteria when we put

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.050 
the rest of the bacteria when we put
unclean<00:02:06.670> water<00:02:07.649> so<00:02:08.649> whenever<00:02:08.830> we<00:02:09.429> poured

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
unclean water so whenever we poured

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.960 
unclean water so whenever we poured
water<00:02:10.290> that<00:02:11.290> layer<00:02:11.470> of<00:02:11.500> bacteria<00:02:12.010> will<00:02:12.190> fight

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
the bacteria in the water and we get the

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.770 
the bacteria in the water and we get the
water<00:02:17.290> filters<00:02:17.709> down<00:02:17.890> and<00:02:18.330> we<00:02:19.330> get<00:02:19.510> clean

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
water filters down and we get clean

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.060 
water filters down and we get clean
water<00:02:19.930> through<00:02:20.260> this<00:02:20.380> pipe<00:02:20.650> which<00:02:20.800> will<00:02:20.920> be

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
water through this pipe which will be

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:27.000 
water through this pipe which will be
collected<00:02:21.550> which<00:02:21.730> we<00:02:21.910> can<00:02:22.090> see<00:02:25.800> what<00:02:26.800> is<00:02:26.890> this

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
collected which we can see what is this

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.460 
collected which we can see what is this
coin<00:02:27.250> this<00:02:27.970> is<00:02:28.120> called<00:02:28.360> a<00:02:28.450> bio<00:02:28.630> sand<00:02:28.959> filter

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
coin this is called a bio sand filter

you're made this essentially doesn't

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.420 
you're made this essentially doesn't
involve<00:02:37.120> any<00:02:37.330> cost<00:02:37.720> this<00:02:38.680> is<00:02:38.739> just<00:02:39.010> a<00:02:39.100> bottle

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
involve any cost this is just a bottle

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.460 
involve any cost this is just a bottle
and<00:02:39.580> this<00:02:39.700> is<00:02:39.850> sand<00:02:40.060> you<00:02:40.390> can<00:02:40.510> get<00:02:40.690> anywhere<00:02:41.140> if

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
and this is sand you can get anywhere if

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.440 
and this is sand you can get anywhere if
you<00:02:42.040> just<00:02:42.250> walk<00:02:42.610> down<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.910> street<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.330> you'll

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
you just walk down the street and you'll

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.770 
you just walk down the street and you'll
find<00:02:43.959> it<00:02:44.080> and<00:02:44.400> if<00:02:45.400> this<00:02:45.489> pipe<00:02:45.730> can<00:02:45.970> be<00:02:46.090> made<00:02:46.239> and

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
find it and if this pipe can be made and

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.220 
find it and if this pipe can be made and
write<00:02:47.680> it<00:02:47.890> so<00:02:48.060> two<00:02:49.060> liter<00:02:49.270> bottle<00:02:49.930> it's<00:02:50.020> a<00:02:50.110> two

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
write it so two liter bottle it's a two

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.000 
write it so two liter bottle it's a two
liter<00:02:50.500> pack<00:02:50.620> water

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
liter pack water

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.050 
liter pack water
you've<00:02:51.100> done<00:02:51.220> something<00:02:51.430> interesting<00:02:51.640> with

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
you've done something interesting with

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.500 
you've done something interesting with
the<00:02:52.209> top<00:02:53.020> off<00:02:53.230> of<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.500> bottle<00:02:53.800> yeah<00:02:54.390> this<00:02:55.390> is

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
the top off of the bottle yeah this is

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.690 
the top off of the bottle yeah this is
basically<00:02:55.870> aggregates<00:02:56.470> and<00:02:56.680> when<00:02:57.400> you<00:02:57.520> pour

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
basically aggregates and when you pour

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.320 
basically aggregates and when you pour
water<00:02:58.620> directly<00:02:59.620> it<00:02:59.830> will<00:02:59.920> create<00:03:00.190> a<00:03:00.280> hole<00:03:01.150> or

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
water directly it will create a hole or

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.500 
water directly it will create a hole or
a<00:03:01.360> ditch<00:03:01.630> so<00:03:02.380> this<00:03:02.950> instead<00:03:03.940> of<00:03:04.030> wasting<00:03:04.209> the

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
a ditch so this instead of wasting the

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.900 
a ditch so this instead of wasting the
top<00:03:04.720> part<00:03:05.019> of<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.290> bottle<00:03:05.470> what<00:03:06.310> I've<00:03:06.489> done<00:03:06.700> is

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
top part of the bottle what I've done is

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.729 
top part of the bottle what I've done is
punched<00:03:07.720> holes<00:03:07.989> you<00:03:08.769> can<00:03:08.920> see<00:03:09.750> here<00:03:10.750> around

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
punched holes you can see here around

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.250 
punched holes you can see here around
the<00:03:11.950> circumference<00:03:12.940> of<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.330> bottle<00:03:13.690> and<00:03:13.840> over

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
the circumference of the bottle and over

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.119 
the circumference of the bottle and over
here

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
here

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.339 
here
so<00:03:15.519> when<00:03:15.700> we<00:03:15.879> place<00:03:16.390> this<00:03:16.569> over<00:03:16.719> here<00:03:16.930> and<00:03:17.140> pour

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
so when we place this over here and pour

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:19.470 
so when we place this over here and pour
water<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:18.280> water<00:03:18.459> drips<00:03:18.879> through<00:03:19.150> the<00:03:19.299> host

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
water the water drips through the host

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.199 
water the water drips through the host
so<00:03:20.019> that<00:03:20.200> there<00:03:20.799> is<00:03:20.920> no<00:03:21.069> ditches<00:03:21.430> form<00:03:21.849> in<00:03:22.150> that

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
so that there is no ditches form in that

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.979 
so that there is no ditches form in that
right<00:03:23.200> and<00:03:23.590> did<00:03:23.709> you<00:03:23.769> wash<00:03:23.980> the<00:03:24.189> syringe<00:03:24.609> there

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
right and did you wash the syringe there

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.289 
right and did you wash the syringe there
yeah<00:03:25.989> this<00:03:26.290> this<00:03:26.590> sand<00:03:26.889> has<00:03:27.069> been<00:03:27.099> washed<00:03:27.549> a<00:03:27.790> to

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
yeah this this sand has been washed a to

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:29.610 
yeah this this sand has been washed a to
remember<00:03:28.569> to<00:03:28.689> remove<00:03:28.959> all<00:03:29.049> the<00:03:29.200> particulate

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
remember to remove all the particulate

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.280 
remember to remove all the particulate
matter<00:03:29.939> so<00:03:30.939> that<00:03:32.159> when<00:03:33.510> when<00:03:34.510> we<00:03:34.659> actually

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
matter so that when when we actually

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.110 
matter so that when when we actually
start<00:03:35.620> the<00:03:35.769> process<00:03:36.159> we<00:03:36.370> don't<00:03:36.579> have<00:03:36.760> to<00:03:36.909> clean

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
start the process we don't have to clean

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.520 
start the process we don't have to clean
it<00:03:37.150> that<00:03:37.389> many<00:03:37.599> times<00:03:37.840> right<00:03:38.139> so<00:03:38.349> this

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
it that many times right so this

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.440 
it that many times right so this
aggregate<00:03:38.980> has<00:03:39.099> been<00:03:39.280> washed<00:03:39.549> quite<00:03:40.180> a<00:03:40.209> few

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
aggregate has been washed quite a few

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.470 
aggregate has been washed quite a few
times<00:03:40.629> say<00:03:41.379> 15<00:03:41.739> to<00:03:41.829> 20<00:03:42.099> times<00:03:42.129> and<00:03:42.819> it's<00:03:43.030> the

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
times say 15 to 20 times and it's the

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.580 
times say 15 to 20 times and it's the
sand<00:03:43.719> particle<00:03:44.049> is<00:03:44.139> less<00:03:44.290> than<00:03:44.409> one

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
sand particle is less than one

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.559 
sand particle is less than one
millimeter<00:03:44.829> one<00:03:45.189> millimeter<00:03:45.639> size<00:03:45.909> right<00:03:46.299> and

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
millimeter one millimeter size right and

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.720 
millimeter one millimeter size right and
place<00:03:46.840> about<00:03:47.169> two<00:03:47.530> and<00:03:47.650> a<00:03:47.709> half<00:03:47.739> inches<00:03:48.189> in<00:03:48.549> the

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
place about two and a half inches in the

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.209 
place about two and a half inches in the
bottle<00:03:49.290> yeah<00:03:50.290> there<00:03:50.500> should<00:03:50.620> be<00:03:50.769> turn<00:03:50.919> out<00:03:51.099> to
