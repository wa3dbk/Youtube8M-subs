00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.049
 I do not have anything clear what happened to the 

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:07.870
 gallito vÃ¡zquez if his visa was taken away 

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:10.150
 if they did not take it away what happened 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:13.709
 we hear please please seems please 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.709
 we can listen to the Basque rooster 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:20.740
 but I think I had something like that and it was 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.020
 the reason that the club experience 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.180
 already good the federation already inhabited a 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.390
 letter and throw rules but quiet me 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:31.119
 because they told me I was going to be 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.920
 there they are talking about their life not yet 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.390
 I think there 's no missing had 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.550
 matches then you have to 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.900
 take advantage of them and if we are there well if 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:42.950
 no then so work 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:45.170
 well there it is to see with our good 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.360
 friend paco sail what happened I read 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.720
 what I hear what I hear is that 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:57.440
 he says he brought a tape or some dye and 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:01:00.470
 stuck something that does not have to 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.600
 change if you have it to enter be and 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:06.339
 Then I'll tell you in advance so you can 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.339
 get a new life something something something 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:15.740
 something that some tape of them do not enter 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:18.140
 with a tourist visa on b1 b2 which is 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.330
 the one that grants comfort to the states 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.160
 together, I'm here safe because that's not how 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.650
 explained the national team people to 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.050
 be such a large group and being 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.119
 constant that footballer in those who 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.530
 they are calling the national team not 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.800
 everyone has the possibility of having a 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.150
 work visa 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.280
 imagine each year of renewing of year and 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.020
 year then they enter with the one of tourist 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.450
 here I surely had the one 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.070
 stuck to the passport maybe had a 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.350
 direct something 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.700
 some letters swallow and paste the 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.700
 commissions from his girlfriend or something 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.720
 then to see this maybe they gave him a 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.370
 provisional use with this same view 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.600
 but you have to go to that until now 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:02.170
 I think to say so serious because 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.170
 finally that yes no 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.810
 selling
