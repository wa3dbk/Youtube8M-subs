and it's by default named custom backup

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.480 
and it's by default named custom backup
that<00:04:51.590> ISO<00:04:52.360> if<00:04:53.360> I<00:04:54.200> click<00:04:54.470> this<00:04:54.680> you<00:04:54.950> can<00:04:55.340> see

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
that ISO if I click this you can see

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.409 
that ISO if I click this you can see
that<00:04:55.520> it's<00:04:55.930> 1.2<00:04:56.930> gigabytes<00:04:57.940> my<00:04:58.940> file<00:04:59.150> system

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
that it's 1.2 gigabytes my file system

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:03.969 
that it's 1.2 gigabytes my file system
is<00:04:59.870> about<00:05:00.710> seven<00:05:01.490> gigs<00:05:01.870> so<00:05:02.870> from<00:05:03.229> that<00:05:03.380> 7<00:05:03.740> gigs

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
is about seven gigs so from that 7 gigs

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:08.080 
is about seven gigs so from that 7 gigs
I<00:05:04.220> got<00:05:04.930> 1.2<00:05:05.930> gigs<00:05:06.229> out<00:05:06.530> of<00:05:06.650> it<00:05:06.800> so<00:05:07.669> you<00:05:07.700> can<00:05:07.910> see

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
I got 1.2 gigs out of it so you can see

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.490 
I got 1.2 gigs out of it so you can see
that<00:05:08.419> it<00:05:08.539> it<00:05:09.080> shrinks<00:05:10.330> your<00:05:11.330> file<00:05:11.600> system<00:05:12.050> so

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
that it it shrinks your file system so

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.409 
that it it shrinks your file system so
it<00:05:12.620> saves<00:05:12.889> space<00:05:13.100> and<00:05:15.370> now<00:05:16.370> all<00:05:16.639> you<00:05:17.150> have<00:05:17.180> to
