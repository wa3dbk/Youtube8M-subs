00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.730
 Hi, I'm the fist and I'm an illustrator and 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.620
 educator and what I started to work as 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.690
 illustrator of 20 years ago I worked 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.520
 especially in advertising in the field 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.110
 editorial in press although you can 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.789
 say that my favorite field of the 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.679
 illustration of franchises 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.060
 at the time of beginning to illustrate what 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:26.609
 we have to take into account especially 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.140
 is that it's not a matter of using the 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.419
 hand but above all to use your 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.949
 brain is a good way to approach the 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.300
 drawing not only through a pencil in 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.339
 paper but through digital drawing 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.540
 offers you so many possibilities and so many 

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:38.040
 tools that will do this 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.269
 experience something a lot more fun 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.809
 Not to mention that we have greater 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:44.339
 ease to correct in 2011 I had the 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.930
 lucky to be invited to give a 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:47.070
 speak in the evil that speech has 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.290
 had so much success that I've wanted 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.790
 design a course that is related to 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.379
 all the subjects that I talked about in 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.330
 those talks with this course not only 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.220
 you can learn to use your hand but 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.809
 also to use your brain to apply 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.820
 the combination of both at the time of 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.100
 illustrate and generate your own projects 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.989
 in an intelligent way in the project 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.579
 of this course we will create an illustration 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.350
 that we will prepare to be printed in 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:09.210
 serigraphy risso grafÃ­a or any other 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.770
 technique we will also learn how 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.720
 we can reproduce these techniques 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.460
 handmade printing in our house 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.799
 in an authentically false way today 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.570
 we will see how I face the process of 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.369
 generate one of my illustrations too 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.630
 we will see some of my influences as 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.460
 I usually organize my library 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.200
 references will share with you a 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.340
 file with all my feeds you will have 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.170
 access to the hundred 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.670
 about illustration about art about 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.079
 anything that I usually follow 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.310
 we will see what the first steps are 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.200
 what you have to give to start drawing 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.460
 with a graphic tablet we will solve 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.679
 also some exercises of 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.000
 digital graphomotor that is, a 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:40.590
 computer version of those 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.270
 booklets that we made of small 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.469
 calligraphy to learn to write alone 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.880
 in this case we will use them 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:46.770
 precisely to learn to draw 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.360
 also share with you some 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.950
 tricks that will improve the expression of 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.359
 our characters we will check that 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.310
 truly calcar is not any 

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:54.780
 crime and we will complete together some of 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.030
 my illustrations that he has left half 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.470
 We will also draw a drawing based on 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.030
 some of our favorite songs 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.229
 I will also show you how to plan a 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.700
 project and how a 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.530
 illustration for printing 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.299
 we will see how to apply textures through 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.560
 of the photoshop layer masks and 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.119
 I will show you the steps that must be taken 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.039
 to make a home impression 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.830
 artisan with separation of time for 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.840
 get an original practically 1 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.610
 to do this course you will need a 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.230
 computer preferably a tablet 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.940
 graphic although if you do not have it and you're 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.380
 brave being able to solve the exercises 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.120
 only with the mouse will it also make you 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.710
 missing some software like photoshop or 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.540
 some of your jeans alternatives 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.140
 affinity keep studio paint or any 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.140
 another may be worth 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.210
 the course is designed for all 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.380
 levels whether you want to start 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.000
 draw and you want to do it through 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.560
 of the computer as if you're already a 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.390
 usual cartoonist and he has never 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.800
 happened to try a graphics tablet and 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.240
 you just want to know how is my 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.740
 way to work or do you want to spend a 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.130
 good time action or something creative this 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.130
 course 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.920
 and somehow all this that I have 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.450
 told does not convince you to do this 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.450
 course is always I can play a song
