cayenne pepper a little bit of paprika I
wind<00:00:58.920> up<00:00:59.070> putting<00:00:59.250> sherry<00:00:59.820> in<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.359> soup<00:01:00.629> to

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
give it a little smoky flavor I took

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.149 
give it a little smoky flavor I took
something<00:01:03.030> as<00:01:03.359> simple<00:01:03.750> as<00:01:04.080> opening<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.890> can<00:01:05.129> of

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
something as simple as opening a can of

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.810 
something as simple as opening a can of
soup<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.869> expanded<00:01:06.869> on<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.650> method<00:01:08.130> created

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
soup and expanded on the method created

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.990 
soup and expanded on the method created
variations<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:10.049> if<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.560> can<00:01:11.130> open<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.549> can<00:01:11.580> of

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
variations so if you can open a can of

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.780 
variations so if you can open a can of
cream<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:12.720> mushroom<00:01:13.170> soup<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.890> pour<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.640> over

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
cream of mushroom soup and pour it over

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.210 
cream of mushroom soup and pour it over
chicken<00:01:15.270> breasts<00:01:15.780> like<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.020> 1950s<00:01:16.979> housewife

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
chicken breasts like a 1950s housewife

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.940 
chicken breasts like a 1950s housewife
well<00:01:18.000> that's<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.479> method<00:01:18.750> maybe<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.650> can<00:01:19.799> do

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
well that's a method maybe you can do

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.070 
well that's a method maybe you can do
that<00:01:20.070> with<00:01:20.340> fish<00:01:20.700> or<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.450> know<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.750> cream<00:01:22.049> of

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
that with fish or you know the cream of

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.649 
that with fish or you know the cream of
mushroom<00:01:22.439> soup<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:23.310> your<00:01:23.520> sauce<00:01:23.820> maybe<00:01:24.450> you

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
outside you think it's the grill because

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.090 
outside you think it's the grill because
the<00:02:02.790> transfer<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.450> heat<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:04.020> exactly<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.860> same
