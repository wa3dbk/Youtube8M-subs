00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.529
 today we are going to make a mille 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.540
 Eggplant with a tempura without flour 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:24.090
 tempura the ingredients that we are going to 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:31.119
 need are egg salmorejo ham 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:33.750
 eggplant salt flour cornstarch yeast and 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:33.750
 beer 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.730
 In a bowl we are going to throw the flour 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:49.090
 cornstarch salt 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.809
 and the yeast and we will move it to 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.809
 that integrates well 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:59.530
 now let's take the egg and let's 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.390
 go throwing the beer you have to 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.360
 be very cold 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.009
 beer is optional you can do it 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.290
 also with water but I liked the 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:11.909
 flavor that it gives to the beer and we are going to 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.909
 keep moving until everything is integrated 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:22.860
 we have moved and as you can see there is a mass 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.159
 liquid, now is the time to 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.860
 let stand for about 5 minutes 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.470
 our mass 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.720
 while the tempura is resting 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.160
 to go cutting the aubergine more or less 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.440
 about half a finger thick 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.540
 this will also depend on each 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.640
 person that you like or more finite or more 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.970
 thick for me this is the measure 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.970
 correct 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.710
 we have put the slices of eggplant 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:56.030
 so that they catch the tempura well and now 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.030
 we are going to take it 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.590
 in the fryer or frying pan with oil for 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.590
 to be done on both sides 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.800
 we are taking out the aubergine that is already 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.330
 fried on both sides and I do not know if 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.340
 appreciate what chubby is left 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.660
 of our tempura well let's go 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.720
 doing the same with all the 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.910
 eggplant 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.180
 while we make the aubergines we are going to 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.760
 put in water to boil an egg so that 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.300
 It gets hard once the egg has been 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.100
 cooked let's throw it in cold water 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.690
 once we have all our 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.850
 eggplant let's take the ones that are 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.590
 about the same size to make 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.350
 the milonga 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.710
 let's catch 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:47.600
 and let's put an eggplant 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:50.750
 we are going to take salmorejo that we are going to 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.000
 leave the link of how it is done let's 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.650
 also throw the egg that has already been 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.470
 cooled 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:01.210
 minced 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.210
 and the ham that we have chopped 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:09.989
 let's put an eggplant capita and 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:09.989
 we crush a little 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.270
 we take another spoonful of our 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:19.290
 friends 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.290
 let's put egg 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.870
 the ham 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:30.230
 and finally another layer of eggplant and 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.969
 the latter only with salmorejo and 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.969
 we have our mellows made 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.560

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.380
