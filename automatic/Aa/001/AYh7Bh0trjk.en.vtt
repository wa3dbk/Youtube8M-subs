00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:06.880
 for pollination a dream that talisman which 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.730
 has a functional female type of flower 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:13.589
 a variety of Muscat was planted 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:15.999
 which has very good pollen and 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:18.490
 inflorescences have two inflorescences in one 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:21.699
 half a thousand florets and is 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.740
 very good pollinators but variety over 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:27.369
 fruitful on one shoot gives up 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:31.230
 four inflorescences inflorescences very large 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:35.230
 flower size before flowering 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.350
 a4 size is therefore on this sort 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.560
 before flowering we have to do the normalization 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.880
 1 normalization is done when we can 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:48.310
 distinguish inflorescence first to distinguish from 2 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:51.160
 always leave the lower inflorescence more often 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:56.560
 rather, they shod the top she most often 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:59.820
 less we remove on every escape not 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.820
 more than one flower 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:07.050
 difficult to say so says varieties 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:11.410
 suicides who do not ration themselves 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:13.900
 heavily overloaded crop before flowering 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.640
 we left one flower as early as 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.280
 early flowering or just before 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.920
 bloom we leave one inflorescence on 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.800
 two escapes in this case passes 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.280
 normal and pollination of this variety 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.720
 otherwise he drops flowers and 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.010
 much bunch pea turns out 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.510
 sparse as soon as we can 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.810
 distinguish inflorescence 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:41.940
 leave the bottom from before flowering 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.940
 leave one inflorescence for 2 win 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:52.979
 it is a pity at first it seems to delete such 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:52.979
 beauty but there is no other choice 

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:03.060
 look carefully already by inexperience 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.369
 often the second third inflorescence is removed and 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.679
 the top of the shoot so at night so 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.069
 look carefully and decide 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:21.120
 where inflorescences where the tip 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:25.430
 remove only inflorescences very large 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.430
 beautiful inflorescences in this variety 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.430
 all varieties are the best determinant 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.430
 for grade mascot
