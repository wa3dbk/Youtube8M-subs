00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
just can't and like the back is a bit

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.700

like<00:05:27.449> lower<00:05:27.860> like<00:05:28.860> my<00:05:29.009> hair<00:05:29.250> covered<00:05:29.669> it<00:05:29.789> so

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
like lower like my hair covered it so

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.619

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:35.719 
see I just basically looked like this
and<00:05:33.960> I<00:05:34.169> think<00:05:34.229> the<00:05:34.469> fact<00:05:34.650> that<00:05:34.770> I<00:05:35.009> have<00:05:35.310> a<00:05:35.340> scarf

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
and I think the fact that I have a scarf

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:40.159 
and I think the fact that I have a scarf
so<00:05:36.509> it's<00:05:36.689> not<00:05:36.870> like<00:05:37.169> too<00:05:37.349> much<00:05:37.560> um<00:05:38.430> I<00:05:39.169> don't

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
so it's not like too much um I don't
