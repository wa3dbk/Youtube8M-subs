00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:21.679
 some time ago I read on the UFO site a 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.390
 very interesting question if 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:26.390
 we discovered the material 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.359
 antigravity that would allow us to 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.390
 do interstellar travel with great 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:34.760
 ease and find some 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.460
 example planet inhabited by beings 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.789
 intelligent but not yet 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.989
 able to carry out space travel or 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:49.010
 that we would do the site still suggests some 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:52.899
 answers are 1 we would make a 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:55.280
 immediate intervention 2 we would analyze 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:58.010
 We would study this civilization to 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.370
 distance and then decide for 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.949
 to intervene or not and 3 would decide 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.040
 analyze and study but without doing 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:09.170
 interventions because an intervention 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.229
 great harm to 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.650
 that civilization starting from this 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:18.229
 position we can reflect a lot 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.570
 first we can put ourselves in the 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.900
 place of the aliens who visit the 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.220
 planet earth and try to imagine 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.909
 answers to the main questions 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.930
 sociological perspectives paralleling the 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.470
 humanity 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.780
 we must bear in mind that a civilization 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:39.979
 who does not know his place in the 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.350
 universe not necessarily behind the 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:46.909
 example of human beings who 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.750
 they were in space in 1961 as yuri 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.750
 gagÃ¡rin 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.899
 before this date we were already evolved 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:57.049
 technologically complex relationships 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:02:00.680
 huge constructions we flew in 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:04.280
 machines and our medicine was already modern 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.500
 then be like the ones the question supposes 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.580
 might well be on a level 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.950
 technological high of course a trip 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.640
 example of the 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.830
 humanity behind 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.100
 knowledge in various technologies 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:23.160
 that are used in our day to day life. 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:26.610
 might not be possible on the days of 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.910
 today if it were not for space exploration 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.360
 but we should also think that the lack of 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:36.270
 knowledge of its place in the universe 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:39.030
 would inevitably bring to these beings the 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.340
 culture of legends about the creation of 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.370
 planet and themselves 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.980
 example of what occurs and occurred in the 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.280
 majority of the religions of mankind 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.980
 this could cause these beings 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.280
 considered to be evil beings a 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.050
 parallel with the devil that is present 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.780
 in our society 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.030
 In addition an intervention could be 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.820
 much more traumatizing than the 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.320
 cultural cultural conflict and 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.390
 knowledge 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.640
 example of what happened with the 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.660
 native peoples of america with the 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.519
 European 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.790
 we could end up destroying a 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:21.360
 whole civilization is purposely 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.760
 or not for those who do not know thousands of 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.549
 native people died by simple contact 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.670
 with Europeans since many diseases 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:32.100
 that existed in Europe did not exist 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.579
 among the natives what caused that 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:38.329
 simple diseases such as influenza would 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:41.910
 being mortal to the Indians 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:44.489
 another parallel we can do 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.070
 about animals here on earth 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:50.010
 we can analyze that even without the 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:52.950
 intention to destroy nature and even 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.590
 with natural preservation areas still 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.560
 so here on planet earth 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:01.890
 many animals are extinct or on the verge of 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.180
 of extinction by the simple coexistence with 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.760
 the humans 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.579
 an ecosystem is only healthy when 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.130
 lived in balance and the human being as 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:14.000
 strange body on that fictitious planet 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:17.250
 of the question could unbalance 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.530
 seriously alien planet 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:23.289
 these questions in view as 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.900
 we will obviously proceed 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:28.599
 human curiosity and earns 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.840
 knowledge and make us want to study 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:35.110
 these beings to study this planet and 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:38.289
 find out as much about them as possible 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:41.229
 would not be an easy task to achieve 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:43.720
 this goal without interfering we can 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:46.360
 imagine that for the extraterrestrials who 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.900
 visit us is not a task either. 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.340
 easy and so maybe they do not want 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.069
 Show off 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.110
 we should also bear in mind that the study 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:58.889
 of an entire planet and of a 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.240
 whole civilization even more 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:03.759
 extraterrestrial with components 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.780
 totally different from what we have here 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:07.990
 in the land 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:10.720
 it would take years maybe decades 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:13.229
 in this period the alien beings amy 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.240
 would be our ships and sometimes 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:19.000
 our astronauts on ground 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.940
 If we wanted to go further we would have 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.449
 to reduce many of the creatures without 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.400
 know for sure if our procedures 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:29.949
 would or would not harm them 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.500
 who works with statistics or have 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:35.020
 some notion of this knows that for 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.570
 studying a population should get 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:41.080
 countless samples to obtain a 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:43.960
 result as faithful as possible imagine 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.599
 then how much would we have to study to 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.930
 to fully map a planet 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:53.080
 whole would perhaps explain why 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:55.690
 aliens are listed from the 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:58.690
 the beginnings of human civilization 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:01.289
 we must also take into account that 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:04.150
 it would not make sense any long trip 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:07.090
 unraveling the universe if it were not for 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:09.219
 to study in depth each of the planets and 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.909
 civilizations that we could find 

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:12.340
 front 

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:15.520
 it is worth noting that according to our 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:18.520
 current knowledge there must be thousands 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:21.340
 of intelligent civilizations only in our 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:24.009
 galaxy but this number is still 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:26.740
 compared with the billions of 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:28.160
 stars and billions of planets 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:31.889
 are there on the way there 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:34.680
 then finding intelligent life does not 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:37.830
 would be so easy with billions of 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:40.620
 options to look for so case 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:43.789
 we would meet with certainty 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:48.120
 want to know everything about this civilization 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:51.690
 before going on to look for more life 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:55.259
 but what do you think, do not stop
