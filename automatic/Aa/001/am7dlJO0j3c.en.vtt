00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:41.660 
self is worth 500 so be just you'd be
better<00:02:35.060> off<00:02:35.180> running<00:02:35.659> that<00:02:35.780> twice<00:02:38.739> but<00:02:39.739> uh

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
better off running that twice but uh

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.210 
better off running that twice but uh
yeah<00:02:42.670> this<00:02:42.819> this<00:02:43.209> gun<00:02:43.480> is<00:02:43.510> insane<00:02:44.500> like<00:02:45.010> it's<00:02:45.160> a

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
yeah this this gun is insane like it's a

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.790 
yeah this this gun is insane like it's a
fusion<00:02:45.459> rifle<00:02:45.910> but<00:02:46.360> it's<00:02:46.510> a<00:02:46.630> sniper<00:02:47.230> it's

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
fusion rifle but it's a sniper it's

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.949 
fusion rifle but it's a sniper it's
classified<00:02:48.700> as<00:02:48.850> a<00:02:48.880> fusion<00:02:49.240> rifle<00:02:49.540> so<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:49.780> ammo

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
classified as a fusion rifle so the ammo

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:57.660 
classified as a fusion rifle so the ammo
pool<00:02:50.230> is<00:02:50.380> insanely<00:02:51.130> big<00:02:51.640> and<00:02:56.340> like<00:02:57.340> after<00:02:57.459> you

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
pool is insanely big and like after you

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:58.949 
pool is insanely big and like after you
get<00:02:57.819> used<00:02:57.940> to<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:58.209> charge<00:02:58.390> of<00:02:58.540> time<00:02:58.690> it's

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
get used to the charge of time it's

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.390 
get used to the charge of time it's
actually<00:02:59.230> not<00:02:59.350> that<00:02:59.410> bad<00:02:59.560> like<00:03:00.100> there's<00:03:00.280> two

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
actually not that bad like there's two

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.740 
actually not that bad like there's two
different<00:03:00.580> sites<00:03:00.850> that<00:03:01.000> you<00:03:01.090> can<00:03:01.239> use<00:03:01.420> one<00:03:01.630> as

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
different sites that you can use one as

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.559 
different sites that you can use one as
the<00:03:01.840> marksman<00:03:02.260> wants<00:03:02.470> a<00:03:02.530> combat<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:04.209> combat

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
the marksman wants a combat the combat

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.809 
the marksman wants a combat the combat
which<00:03:04.989> i<00:03:05.170> was<00:03:05.290> using<00:03:05.500> this<00:03:05.739> video<00:03:05.980> here<00:03:06.220> is<00:03:06.430> a

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
which i was using this video here is a

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.520 
which i was using this video here is a
faster<00:03:07.360> charge<00:03:07.600> time<00:03:07.810> but<00:03:08.050> it's<00:03:08.170> not<00:03:08.319> as<00:03:08.410> much

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
faster charge time but it's not as much

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.740 
faster charge time but it's not as much
range<00:03:08.860> but<00:03:09.130> you<00:03:09.280> can<00:03:09.489> actually<00:03:09.700> just<00:03:09.970> get<00:03:10.660> the

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
range but you can actually just get the

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.150 
range but you can actually just get the
same<00:03:10.989> range<00:03:11.260> as<00:03:11.319> the<00:03:11.470> other<00:03:11.590> scope<00:03:11.830> just<00:03:12.069> by

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
same range as the other scope just by

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.880 
same range as the other scope just by
using<00:03:12.280> send<00:03:12.700> it<00:03:12.820> and<00:03:13.080> I<00:03:14.080> recommend<00:03:14.470> using<00:03:14.590> send

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
using send it and I recommend using send

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.880 
using send it and I recommend using send
it<00:03:14.980> anyways<00:03:15.250> because<00:03:15.430> it<00:03:15.850> increases<00:03:16.120> the

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
it anyways because it increases the

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.600 
it anyways because it increases the
hitbox<00:03:17.890> size<00:03:18.390> for<00:03:19.390> the<00:03:19.480> head<00:03:19.660> and<00:03:20.459> hidden<00:03:21.459> hand

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
hitbox size for the head and hidden hand

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.990 
hitbox size for the head and hidden hand
as<00:03:21.790> well<00:03:22.060> which<00:03:22.360> also<00:03:22.720> increases<00:03:23.080> the<00:03:24.000> hitbox

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
as well which also increases the hitbox

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.740 
as well which also increases the hitbox
eyes<00:03:25.150> for<00:03:25.330> the<00:03:25.390> head<00:03:26.940> now<00:03:27.940> I<00:03:27.970> couldn't<00:03:28.510> really

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
eyes for the head now I couldn't really

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.710 
eyes for the head now I couldn't really
notice<00:03:29.170> too<00:03:29.290> much<00:03:29.470> of<00:03:29.560> a<00:03:29.620> difference<00:03:29.950> with<00:03:30.130> the

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
notice too much of a difference with the

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.229 
notice too much of a difference with the
the<00:03:31.720> aim<00:03:31.840> assist<00:03:32.140> with<00:03:32.830> hidden<00:03:33.069> hand<00:03:33.340> it

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
the aim assist with hidden hand it

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:35.550 
the aim assist with hidden hand it
didn't<00:03:34.870> really<00:03:35.019> seem<00:03:35.200> to<00:03:35.290> make<00:03:35.440> a<00:03:35.500> difference

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
didn't really seem to make a difference

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.250 
didn't really seem to make a difference
because<00:03:36.480> I'm<00:03:37.480> used<00:03:37.660> to<00:03:37.750> using<00:03:37.870> the<00:03:38.080> land

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
because I'm used to using the land

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.949 
because I'm used to using the land
beyond<00:03:38.500> with<00:03:38.709> iron<00:03:39.069> sights<00:03:39.190> so<00:03:39.850> I'm<00:03:40.180> always

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
beyond with iron sights so I'm always

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.780 
beyond with iron sights so I'm always
moving<00:03:41.319> my<00:03:41.560> stick<00:03:42.390> but<00:03:43.390> uh<00:03:44.370> yeah<00:03:45.370> Singh<00:03:45.610> hits

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
moving my stick but uh yeah Singh hits

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.270 
moving my stick but uh yeah Singh hits
