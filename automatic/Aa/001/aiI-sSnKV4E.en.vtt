00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:19.670
 but because the tribune of new ships 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:23.689
 I missed something that I consciously think is not 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:26.440
 let's talk about the game and the hare because 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:29.170
 well, the most important asher error happens 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.820
 the beginning of the second half we give a prize 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.710
 erased that this habits which attack 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.940
 the first half pass back in 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.879
 which feel the rhythm 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.020
 information order to put them 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.770
 endings over the game 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.920
 let know that we will continue without 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:49.550
 love and do 1 time 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:52.190
 gap more made a lot of mistakes in 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:57.110
 mean at the beginning of the first minutes and even 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:59.899
 came back in the second half we are a little 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.480
 surrendered to the defense we will allow any moment 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:05.030
 returns cannot be given to such a team 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.070
 with such sores catch the moment we 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.060
 allowed the podium and return to the game a 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.590
 it is not good 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.229
 we made them feel confident 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.970
 this should not be allowed away matches in 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.400
 the first half we coped with it 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.380
 foot misfortune could handle it 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.380
 in the second so we lost 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.640
 panels have long been no stand on you too 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.920
 I donâ€™t think of flu 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.440
 pressure is likely to blame something about what I 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.300
 spoke especially in defense was the moment 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.780
 when the difference in the score was only one 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.360
 point 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.360
 and we let them take 4 rebounds 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.700
 attacks this was given with a blow impossible 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.710
 give your soup special away games 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.950
 but this match we lost on the move 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.950
 farther
