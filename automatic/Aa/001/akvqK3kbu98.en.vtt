00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
that's a very good question i have no

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:33.840 
that's a very good question i have no
idea<00:05:27.490> uh<00:05:28.169> wow<00:05:30.720> maybe<00:05:31.720> a<00:05:32.490> probable<00:05:33.490> Ariel

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
idea uh wow maybe a probable Ariel

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.250 
idea uh wow maybe a probable Ariel
because<00:05:34.090> she's<00:05:34.240> a<00:05:34.270> mermaid<00:05:34.510> and<00:05:34.840> i<00:05:34.930> really

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.260 
because she's a mermaid and i really

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.170 
because she's a mermaid and i really
like<00:05:35.440> mermaids<00:05:35.860> I<00:05:36.100> don't<00:05:36.490> really<00:05:36.790> know<00:05:37.000> why

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
like mermaids I don't really know why

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.670 
like mermaids I don't really know why
but<00:05:37.450> I<00:05:37.510> think<00:05:37.690> mermaids<00:05:38.020> are<00:05:38.169> like<00:05:38.290> the<00:05:38.530> bomb

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
but I think mermaids are like the bomb

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.140 
but I think mermaids are like the bomb
it's<00:05:38.919> probably<00:05:39.160> because<00:05:39.280> I<00:05:39.430> like<00:05:39.610> I'm<00:05:39.940> always

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
it's probably because I like I'm always

it's probably because I like I'm always
