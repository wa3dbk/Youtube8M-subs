00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
microphones on the amp what you do is

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.979 
microphones on the amp what you do is
you<00:00:40.110> would<00:00:40.230> run<00:00:40.410> your<00:00:40.590> normal<00:00:40.920> guitar<00:00:41.070> cord

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
you would run your normal guitar cord

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.880 
you would run your normal guitar cord
out<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.200> your<00:00:43.350> guitar<00:00:44.210> to<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.239> input<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.440> DI

box of your choice I have an art Series
Z<00:00:50.879> direct<00:00:51.270> here<00:00:51.770> they're<00:00:52.770> under<00:00:53.010> $30.00<00:00:53.670> in

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.490 
Z direct here they're under $30.00 in
they're<00:00:53.940> very<00:00:53.969> good<00:00:54.300> boxes<00:00:54.780> I've<00:00:55.020> had<00:00:55.320> good

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
they're very good boxes I've had good

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.369 
they're very good boxes I've had good
success<00:00:55.710> with<00:00:55.949> these<00:00:56.840> so<00:00:57.840> once<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.170> get<00:00:58.289> the

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
success with these so once you get the

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.680 
success with these so once you get the
guitar<00:00:58.649> running<00:00:58.980> into<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.280> box<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.879> need<00:01:00.570> to

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
guitar running into the box you need to

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.479 
guitar running into the box you need to
run<00:01:00.809> another<00:01:01.079> cable<00:01:01.940> to<00:01:02.940> your<00:01:03.059> amp<00:01:04.250> so<00:01:05.250> that's

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
run another cable to your amp so that's

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.280 
run another cable to your amp so that's
just<00:01:05.760> basically<00:01:06.150> continuing<00:01:06.750> your<00:01:06.990> guitar

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
just basically continuing your guitar

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.359 
just basically continuing your guitar
signal<00:01:07.670> to<00:01:08.670> your<00:01:08.760> amplifier<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.750> instead<00:01:10.110> of

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
signal to your amplifier so instead of

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.710 
signal to your amplifier so instead of
running<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.490> guitar<00:01:11.820> cable<00:01:12.150> straight<00:01:12.450> into

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
running the guitar cable straight into

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.330 
running the guitar cable straight into
your<00:01:12.840> amp<00:01:13.049> you're<00:01:13.470> going<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.650> run<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.310> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
your amp you're going to run it to the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.969 
your amp you're going to run it to the
input<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:14.880> this<00:01:15.060> box<00:01:15.650> then<00:01:16.650> you're<00:01:16.799> going<00:01:16.920> to

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
input of this box then you're going to

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.190 
input of this box then you're going to
take<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.250> through<00:01:17.580> output<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.509> box<00:01:18.720> and

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
take the through output of the box and

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.660 
take the through output of the box and
you<00:01:19.350> were<00:01:19.439> going<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.650> run<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:19.979> into<00:01:20.159> your<00:01:20.430> amp

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
you were going to run it into your amp

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.999 
you were going to run it into your amp
so<00:01:21.450> it's<00:01:21.630> just<00:01:21.810> one<00:01:21.960> continuous<00:01:22.080> signal<00:01:22.860> going

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
so it's just one continuous signal going

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.520 
so it's just one continuous signal going
to<00:01:23.189> your<00:01:23.340> amp<00:01:23.580> with<00:01:24.420> what<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.689> box<00:01:24.869> does<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.380> it

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
to your amp with what the box does is it

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.070 
to your amp with what the box does is it
splits<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.950> signal<00:01:26.130> internally<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.119> it

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
splits the signal internally and it

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.300 
splits the signal internally and it
converts<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.909> high<00:01:30.240> or<00:01:30.720> from<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.259> high<00:01:31.439> Z

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
converts it to a high or from a high Z

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.600 
converts it to a high or from a high Z
input<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.119> low<00:01:33.390> Z<00:01:33.659> output<00:01:34.200> that's<00:01:35.189> good<00:01:35.430> for

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
input to a low Z output that's good for

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.520 
input to a low Z output that's good for
running<00:01:36.090> long<00:01:36.270> distances<00:01:36.299> through<00:01:38.450> stage

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
running long distances through stage

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.840 
running long distances through stage
snake<00:01:40.530> systems<00:01:41.009> which<00:01:41.250> can<00:01:41.430> be<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.579> hundred

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
snake systems which can be a hundred

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.539 
snake systems which can be a hundred
feet<00:01:42.090> or<00:01:42.360> better<00:01:42.920> so<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.040> don't<00:01:44.189> want<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.399> lose

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
feet or better so you don't want to lose

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.100 
feet or better so you don't want to lose
all<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:44.790> signal<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.479> want<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.720> convert

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
all that signal so you want to convert

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.940 
all that signal so you want to convert
it<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.439> low<00:01:46.820> impedance<00:01:47.820> signal<00:01:48.740> so<00:01:49.740> at<00:01:49.829> the

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
it to a low impedance signal so at the

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.319 
it to a low impedance signal so at the
other<00:01:50.100> end<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.430> your<00:01:50.549> mic<00:01:50.729> cords<00:01:51.090> you're<00:01:51.210> going

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
other end of your mic cords you're going

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.389 
other end of your mic cords you're going
to<00:01:51.390> run<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:51.720> either<00:01:51.930> into<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.320> stage<00:01:52.680> box<00:01:53.100> on

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
to run this either into a stage box on

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.639 
to run this either into a stage box on
the<00:01:53.549> floor<00:01:53.700> built<00:01:54.180> into<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.570> floor<00:01:54.689> or<00:01:55.350> you're

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.490 
next to you you can just plug it right
into<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:06.380> so<00:02:07.380> that's<00:02:07.619> how<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.099> wire<00:02:08.459> up

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
into that and so that's how you wire up

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.380 
into that and so that's how you wire up
takes<00:02:10.500> three<00:02:10.830> cables<00:02:11.280> two<00:02:11.520> guitar<00:02:11.849> cables<00:02:12.239> and

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
takes three cables two guitar cables and

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.880 
takes three cables two guitar cables and
a<00:02:12.420> mic<00:02:12.599> cable<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:13.080> get<00:02:13.200> it<00:02:13.319> set<00:02:13.530> up

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
a mic cable to get it set up

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.400 
a mic cable to get it set up
if<00:02:13.950> you're<00:02:14.220> running<00:02:14.400> a<00:02:14.580> live<00:02:14.790> amplifier<00:02:15.570> if

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
if you're running a live amplifier if

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.610 
if you're running a live amplifier if
you're<00:02:16.680> not<00:02:16.890> running<00:02:17.280> a<00:02:17.340> live<00:02:17.550> amplifier<00:02:18.620> then

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
you're not running a live amplifier then

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.770 
you're not running a live amplifier then
you<00:02:19.770> don't<00:02:19.950> need<00:02:20.160> that<00:02:20.400> one<00:02:20.580> so<00:02:21.390> you're<00:02:21.630> just

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
you don't need that one so you're just

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.390 
you don't need that one so you're just
going<00:02:21.960> to<00:02:22.050> run<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.410> guitar<00:02:22.740> straight<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.280> your

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
going to run the guitar straight to your

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.780 
going to run the guitar straight to your
di<00:02:23.580> box<00:02:24.170> run<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.290> DI<00:02:25.500> box<00:02:25.920> straight<00:02:26.370> to<00:02:26.610> your

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
di box run the DI box straight to your

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.890 
di box run the DI box straight to your
snake<00:02:27.060> or<00:02:27.330> channel<00:02:27.660> input<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.400> you're<00:02:29.400> done

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
snake or channel input and you're done

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.690 
snake or channel input and you're done
so<00:02:30.900> that's<00:02:31.080> how<00:02:31.230> easy<00:02:31.260> it<00:02:31.680> is<00:02:31.800> all<00:02:32.160> these<00:02:32.520> boxes

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
so that's how easy it is all these boxes

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.700 
so that's how easy it is all these boxes
have<00:02:33.030> ground<00:02:33.300> lifts<00:02:33.630> on<00:02:33.750> them<00:02:33.930> so<00:02:34.170> that<00:02:34.380> if<00:02:34.590> you

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
have ground lifts on them so that if you

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.910 
have ground lifts on them so that if you
do<00:02:34.890> wind<00:02:35.130> up<00:02:35.280> getting<00:02:35.610> a<00:02:35.700> buzz<00:02:36.320> on<00:02:37.320> an<00:02:37.560> electric

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
do wind up getting a buzz on an electric

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.530 
do wind up getting a buzz on an electric
hole<00:02:38.040> 60<00:02:38.400> cycle<00:02:38.730> buzz<00:02:38.880> you<00:02:39.150> can<00:02:39.300> hit<00:02:39.420> the

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
hole 60 cycle buzz you can hit the

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.050 
hole 60 cycle buzz you can hit the
ground<00:02:39.780> lift<00:02:40.050> on<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.980> box<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.580> that'll<00:02:41.910> take

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
ground lift on the box and that'll take

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.480 
ground lift on the box and that'll take
care<00:02:42.120> of<00:02:42.300> that<00:02:42.420> for<00:02:42.750> you<00:02:43.040> there's<00:02:44.040> usually
