 description and I will come soon 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:58.550
 to the next part it was once number 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:03.080
 it must be five now and that 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:05.150
 This is followed by a comment on where I am 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.610
 had been talking about real friends 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.680
 the question of you if I'm up 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.229
 such a real friend has me 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.060
 several or always thought that would be 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.119
 Also what you the series it was once and 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.850
 so I tell you so too totti has one 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.530
 such a real friend I lived 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.630
 really entrusted everything 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.219
 He knows everything about me when I mist 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.799
 or if I have too 

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:30.680
 I know he can do that 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.060
 just to tell and vice versa 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.640
 of course exactly the same 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.890
 because he knows one hundred percent that if he 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.909
 Something tells me that really nobody 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.789
 learns 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:43.039
 and the same is true the other way around 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:47.179
 that's what I mean with that 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:49.549
 you need such a friend that will 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:52.009
 here it was, so to speak , once upon a time 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.049
 by totti of our best colleagues now 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.060
 but can you think when I say 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.270
 my best colleague is married and 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.920
 Father, you can think of that , I can 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.829
 probably not the stories 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.799
 tell him the most interesting 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:07.759
 Would his current wife be like that? 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.830
 one or the other story 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.980
 Maybe not know 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.600
 and I know that in between times 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.000
 here a channel looks over and over 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.040
 look at the comments and yes if 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.800
 then this story here 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.069
 maybe I would be aware of that 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.230
 also been mourning because of him and 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.090
 I just do not keep things like that 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.120
 But I have a story to tell 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.560
 a short that was actually funny to us 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.180
 we played soccer together 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.159
 also in a team and we have 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.290
 so much celebrated together so 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.879
 discos and so what were they for us 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.859
 not sure at all no matter how three 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:44.200
 until four times a week was a disco 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:45.939
 had such a very days on 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.579
 Saturdays Sundays and Wednesdays and Thursdays 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:50.230
 was once again season preparations 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:53.019
 and our trainer thought of us 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:57.250
 should be just once again 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:58.120
 make forest and on the day so the 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.060
 legs 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.780
 they did not want that and there we have 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:08.949
 just drop us back 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:11.560
 Maybe someday it may be necessary 

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:15.250
 yes not at all if we enter here now 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.650
 little nice and then just a nice one 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.379
 Short cut and then perfect 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.310
 of course sweaty last in the 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:22.989
 target shrink 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.579
 So I found the plan had too 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.590
 just somehow no gaps you have to 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.180
 say that will be real at the time 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.769
 runners the strongest of the team 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.359
 was this running training we had 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.889
 actually not necessary at all and 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:36.069
 This is really ironic 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:38.229
 meant so but the trainer is that 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:41.290
 unfortunately noticed and yes that was one 

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:44.139
 little sour and so we had to 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:47.259
 back to the place with a man and the 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:49.810
 complete team had ten rounds 

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:53.979
 and place so run up again 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:57.759
 on it four kilometers I can tell you 

00:03:53.979 --> 00:04:00.699
 the team was not there 

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:03.220
 happy about it but on the roof times 

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:06.009
 just can not run and if 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.449
 As I recall, we are us 

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:09.519
 were still running slowly 

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:11.379
 Logically, world war just is not 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.219
 four more times were surpassed by 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:14.739
 all other 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:17.289
 if I should continue this series 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:20.169
 Just let me know that sooner 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:23.710
 So what now come for next time the 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:25.210
 out of fun and out of disgusting way though 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.150
 Gameplay is coming to an end, so I say 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.490
 as always moin moin and I hope you 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.789
 sees himself 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.789
 again
