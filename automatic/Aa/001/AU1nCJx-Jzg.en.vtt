some another technique that i like is to
like<00:01:42.649> put<00:01:42.950> cracks<00:01:43.659> in<00:01:44.659> the<00:01:44.810> rock<00:01:45.020> and<00:01:45.470> that's

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
like put cracks in the rock and that's

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.770 
like put cracks in the rock and that's
pretty<00:01:45.979> easy<00:01:46.040> to<00:01:46.310> do<00:01:46.490> actually<00:01:47.060> you<00:01:47.630> just

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
pretty easy to do actually you just

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.380 
pretty easy to do actually you just
gotta<00:01:47.990> take<00:01:48.200> your<00:01:48.350> knife<00:01:48.670> bring<00:01:49.670> yourself<00:01:50.090> and

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
gotta take your knife bring yourself and

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
you can drag it along at an angle and go

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.260 
you can drag it along at an angle and go
back<00:01:54.409> at<00:01:54.439> the<00:01:54.710> other<00:01:54.890> angle

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:05.389 

into<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:59.420> and<00:02:02.030> each<00:02:03.409> contest<00:02:04.409> part<00:02:04.770> was<00:02:04.920> taking

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
into it and each contest part was taking

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.380 
into it and each contest part was taking
out<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.610> chip<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.409> it<00:02:07.640> now<00:02:08.640> all<00:02:08.819> this<00:02:09.030> looks<00:02:09.300> a

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
out a chip of it now all this looks a

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.570 
out a chip of it now all this looks a
little<00:02:09.599> too<00:02:10.229> manufactured<00:02:11.220> right<00:02:12.150> now<00:02:12.470> but

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
little too manufactured right now but

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:21.589 
little too manufactured right now but
when<00:02:14.580> I<00:02:15.290> get<00:02:16.290> into<00:02:16.680> doing<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.580> actual<00:02:20.599> heating

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
when I get into doing the actual heating

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.210 
when I get into doing the actual heating
of<00:02:21.720> it<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.140> shrinking<00:02:22.620> it<00:02:22.739> down<00:02:22.769> a<00:02:22.920> little<00:02:23.069> bit

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
of it and shrinking it down a little bit

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.100 
of it and shrinking it down a little bit
on<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.459> corners<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:23.849> stuff<00:02:24.060> he'll<00:02:24.720> look<00:02:24.930> a

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
on the corners and stuff he'll look a

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.069 
on the corners and stuff he'll look a
lot<00:02:25.379> more<00:02:25.440> natural
