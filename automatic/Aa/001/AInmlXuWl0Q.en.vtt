00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.910
 I am I show the plates today 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.910
 414 2015 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.250
 m 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.710
 the valleys 414 c 2015 very balanced 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.380
 sounding instrument very good 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.479
 also designed for stage use 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.429
 ultimately with the cartel with the 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.079
 pickup system which is installed and 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:40.429
 of the wood used as combination 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.569
 as usual then in the 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:43.939
 last few years a few small ones 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:45.860
 But there are changes here so 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.709
 as usual as one of course 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.170
 400 series of taylor blanket the spruce 

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:53.479
 the cea spruce ceiling decorated on top 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.950
 with a so or with an ebony 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.789
 fingerboard definitely with one 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:01.729
 nature bridge system and the blow something 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:04.099
 wta-tour looks like white binding 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.659
 here as well as that still look relatively 

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:07.610
 simply no big ones 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.649
 elaborate ornaments or something 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.040
 looks from the distance from the stage 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.110
 then actually no one and brussels sprouts 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.390
 body as normal as the 400er 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.950
 series used the only difference 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.910
 then it is actually that he is painted 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.700
 That was not the case before 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.560
 and I have to say both 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.209
 visually as well as it did not sound that way 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.940
 guitar really does not break the guitar 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.220
 Sounds very balanced by that 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.260
 that the body is painted which speaks 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.590
 not quite as fast as before 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.739
 not only has these 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.180
 Those who rent somehow for those of 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.599
 220 14 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.860
 the guitar actually very as that was 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.750
 Actually, that's what they 're known for 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.160
 sharp middle had something not 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.180
 basically bad that especially 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.129
 if I'm in the studio then one more 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.420
 additional day then plays easy 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.860
 to deliver a bit of altitude 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.269
 this one does not quite work and me 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.420
 find your way through nature 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:59.580
 a bit more balanced and good of the urban 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.620
 cabbage that is greenish -looking picks 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.840
 looks up with the high gloss finish 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.280
 every case also good for a total 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.930
 This is the case with the white beining 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.110
 and of course this cover here 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.900
 that this is simply kept in white 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.640
 as it is made of mahogany then as usual the 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.500
 quality of the mechanics of taylor 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.730
 just here also normal taylor 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.470
 thus rosewood or rosewood 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.930
 on the hot plate 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.879
 and here with the cover for the 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.470
 Hals died that's always the case with tele 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:31.319
 a story with the neck setting 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.450
 So actually the neck is for the 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.370
 guitarmaker times dismountable and 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.840
 This allows me to neck directly to the 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.900
 I've always got the strings 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.910
 best playability of that of the 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.680
 guitar in that I just stop that 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.510
 of course, then can adjust curvature 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.310
 the pier system can also optimize this 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.650
 always works pretty good 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.239
 set and that's me then 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.620
 additionally have this variant that I 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.230
 then if you have the neck angle and the 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.790
 HardthÃ¶he can still adjust and just 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.139
 with these components can be the 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.459
 set the guitar wonderful and then 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:00.030
 actually almost everywhere play like an e 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.370
 guitar 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.019
 although they are actually 13s pages 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.519
 on it had special pages set the 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.959
 taylor developed together with alex ii 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:10.380
 has those are the highlights 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:13.079
 they are then in principle at all 2015 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.209
 Models with it on it's me 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:17.729
 have down here the so to speak the 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:21.120
 discant pages so the edi harum the g 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:23.010
 strings are from the 13th page set and 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.990
 then the upper ones are the a and the idea 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.740
 the b page only from the 12 pages set 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:31.110
 And that 's how I break this 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.700
 the ge on the page no longer h where I 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.830
 say I have a sonic difference 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.830
 or not so strong anymore 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.389
 sounds relatively the same and that is included 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:43.580
 other sites where I put this 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:47.090
 So look at the voltage conditions 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.349
 someone else just have one 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.349
 other end ultimately and the 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:52.970
 Sounds relatively the same ebony 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:55.840
 fingerboard in any case as usual 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.460
 at taylor just nice and hard 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.919
 pleasant in the playability and 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.629
 Overall, in any case, also succeeded 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:04.960
 what sounded like me i like this one 

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:04.960
 courageous 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.160
 nice and brilliant but it does not sound right 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.680
 to schaaf that I find the beautiful then 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.940
 also on this paint 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.229
 which in any case with the instrument 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.720
 worth mentioning is it then 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:26.389
 pickup systems again makes you 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.720
 now new in this series, there are 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:31.430
 the first topic sex push system two 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.860
 quiet here maybe in the camera 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.840
 difficult to see 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.599
 this tonabnehmer it, got the Home 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.310
 almost three pieces of how much to do 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:41.180
 after takers behind the pier system 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.310
 sit a bit through it 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.139
 large dinklage can lose weight 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.360
 I can also individually adjust 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:50.449
 and sound when you connect them 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.240
 similar to the condenser microphone can 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:54.530
 Of course now here you show bad 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.909
 it just has to try it out for yourself 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.699
 especially on several ems 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:06:00.740
 have tried how that or does 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:02.120
 maybe also on the ps with us 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.159
 have tried it like that 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.650
 Actually, like feedback, it does 

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:08.360
 that really is or how that sounds and 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.710
 if you start with this sound 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.819
 Can I actually find that is 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.460
 go relatively similar to one 

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:14.810
 capacitor microphone so from the 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.909
 attitude one recognizes somehow 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.919
 the guitar is actually good again 

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:22.610
 ultimately how it sounds in nature 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:24.139
 Just listen and play 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.520
 play sometimes even in the upper positions 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:29.330
 through the cutaway comes here on everyone 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:31.070
 fall well and therefore so 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.599
 some did lie on your side, you can also the 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:35.539
 actually really use it like that 

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:37.370
 said just started playing and then 

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:39.849
 Listen to the beautiful numbers of the 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.849
 guitar on
