00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
sand and alkene at the same time so you

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.300 
sand and alkene at the same time so you
can<00:01:58.530> see<00:01:58.710> like<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:59.579> have<00:02:00.210> like<00:02:00.390> 1000<00:02:01.049> bows<00:02:01.280> now<00:02:02.280> I

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
can see like I have like 1000 bows now I

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.850 
can see like I have like 1000 bows now I
have<00:02:02.520> 900<00:02:03.240> 700<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.020> can<00:02:04.110> see<00:02:04.259> it's<00:02:04.380> going<00:02:04.649> down

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
have 900 700 you can see it's going down

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.649 
have 900 700 you can see it's going down
so<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.100> can<00:02:05.250> see<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.579> it's<00:02:05.759> not<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.450> same

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
so you can see that it's not the same

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.479

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
it's like 28 hour long it doesn't

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.700 
it's like 28 hour long it doesn't

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
flax oh me mining pure essence for like

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.730 
flax oh me mining pure essence for like
an<00:02:20.730> hour<00:02:20.910> I<00:02:21.150> think<00:02:21.600> or<00:02:21.900> an<00:02:22.020> hour<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.440> a<00:02:22.500> half

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
an hour I think or an hour and a half

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.670 
an hour I think or an hour and a half
then<00:02:23.430> buying<00:02:23.730> stuff<00:02:24.150> again<00:02:24.570> then<00:02:25.380> picking

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
then buying stuff again then picking

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.470 
then buying stuff again then picking
flags<00:02:26.100> for<00:02:26.370> an<00:02:26.520> hour<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.090> half<00:02:27.270> I<00:02:27.420> think

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
flags for an hour and a half I think

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.540 
flags for an hour and a half I think
until<00:02:27.960> I<00:02:28.020> realized<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:28.800> I<00:02:28.980> can<00:02:29.160> just<00:02:29.370> use

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
until I realized that I can just use

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.790 
until I realized that I can just use
kingdom<00:02:30.090> management<00:02:30.660> and<00:02:30.900> that's<00:02:31.380> how<00:02:31.530> I<00:02:31.560> got

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
kingdom management and that's how I got

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.820 
kingdom management and that's how I got
over<00:02:31.970> 6000<00:02:32.970> flags<00:02:33.300> so<00:02:34.050> I<00:02:34.080> didn't<00:02:34.350> have<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.650> pick

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
over 6000 flags so I didn't have to pick

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.010 
over 6000 flags so I didn't have to pick
that<00:02:35.010> up<00:02:35.220> then<00:02:35.790> me<00:02:35.970> spinning<00:02:36.420> flag<00:02:36.690> so<00:02:36.960> you

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
that up then me spinning flag so you

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.080 
that up then me spinning flag so you
actually<00:02:37.200> know<00:02:37.560> that<00:02:37.740> I<00:02:37.770> spun<00:02:38.430> all<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.850> flags

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
actually know that I spun all the flags

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.480 
actually know that I spun all the flags
and<00:02:39.390> it's<00:02:39.510> for<00:02:39.750> like<00:02:39.900> six<00:02:40.440> or<00:02:40.620> eight<00:02:40.830> hours<00:02:40.860> and

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
and it's for like six or eight hours and

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.230 
and it's for like six or eight hours and
yeah<00:02:43.280> so<00:02:44.280> yeah<00:02:44.400> this<00:02:44.640> video<00:02:45.000> should<00:02:45.180> be

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
yeah so yeah this video should be

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.480 
yeah so yeah this video should be
available<00:02:45.510> eventually<00:02:46.410> in<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.280> video

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
available eventually in the video

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.280 
available eventually in the video
description<00:02:47.640> but<00:02:48.210> you<00:02:48.240> know<00:02:48.480> this<00:02:48.870> is<00:02:49.020> kind<00:02:49.230> of

description but you know this is kind of

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.870 
description but you know this is kind of
a<00:02:49.410> proof<00:02:49.680> that<00:02:49.710> I've<00:02:50.070> done<00:02:50.310> this<00:02:50.520> but<00:02:50.820> right

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
a proof that I've done this but right

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.380 
a proof that I've done this but right
now<00:02:51.030> I'm<00:02:51.180> 78<00:02:51.630> magic<00:02:52.430> 79<00:02:53.430> magic<00:02:53.850> I<00:02:53.970> mean<00:02:54.150> and

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
now I'm 78 magic 79 magic I mean and

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.810 
now I'm 78 magic 79 magic I mean and
I've<00:02:54.750> been<00:02:54.900> Al<00:02:55.080> King<00:02:55.410> this<00:02:55.890> is<00:02:56.100> just<00:02:56.280> alkene

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
I've been Al King this is just alkene

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.180 
I've been Al King this is just alkene
from<00:02:56.850> like<00:02:57.810> long<00:02:58.110> bows<00:02:58.350> you<00:02:58.380> know<00:02:58.770> you<00:02:58.860> can<00:02:59.010> see

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
from like long bows you know you can see

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.520 
from like long bows you know you can see
my<00:02:59.310> wood<00:02:59.490> cutting<00:02:59.850> level<00:03:00.150> is<00:03:00.330> high<00:03:00.960> so<00:03:01.320> that's

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
my wood cutting level is high so that's

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.020 
my wood cutting level is high so that's
how<00:03:01.620> I<00:03:01.680> get<00:03:01.860> my<00:03:01.920> fletching<00:03:02.400> level<00:03:02.670> up<00:03:02.820> and

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
how I get my fletching level up and

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.910 
how I get my fletching level up and
that's<00:03:03.420> how<00:03:03.540> good<00:03:03.750> my<00:03:03.870> magic<00:03:04.230> level<00:03:04.530> up<00:03:04.650> all<00:03:04.800> of

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
that's how good my magic level up all of

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.970 
that's how good my magic level up all of
these<00:03:05.070> work<00:03:06.060> very<00:03:06.330> nicely<00:03:06.630> together<00:03:07.140> you<00:03:07.860> know

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
these work very nicely together you know

fletching level if I have high cooking

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.160 
fletching level if I have high cooking
level<00:03:23.130> probably<00:03:23.730> have<00:03:24.210> high<00:03:24.450> fishing<00:03:24.840> level

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170

you know smithing mining all of these

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.570 
you know smithing mining all of these
very<00:03:27.480> self-explanatory<00:03:28.190> then<00:03:29.190> you<00:03:29.280> have<00:03:29.430> like
