 michael wigge journalist 33 years old 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.630
 as a foreign reporter, he surprises 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.960
 so far always with unusual 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.940
 Viewing eg in japan in israel 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.510
 he tests the will to peace between 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.699
 Israelis and Palestinians or lived 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.550
 for a time in the Amazonian forest 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.260
 its newest among the yanomami indians 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.930
 project is his biggest ever 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.119
 Challenge 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:33.270
 hello from the A2 near Berlin 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.230

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.960
 traveling the world 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.629
 the end of the world is for michael wigge 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.700

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.520
 Berlin 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.800
 150 days he traveled without a cent one 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.739
 unconventional trip with highlights 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.250
 and painful bouts without money 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:58.469
 means free travel for free 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:01.199
 sleep and eat for free 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:06.119
 food gift sponsored or even in 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.979
 the dustbin culled since 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.740
 I'm determined in the store over 20 euros 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.049
 paid for free travel that means 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:18.360
 especially creativity in the selection 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:20.600
 the means of transport I can over 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.600
 Not 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.299

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.420
 countries 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.400
 and even in columbia cost questions 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.869
 I do not think anything on the street 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.390
 not where I should sleep there is in there 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:52.640
 maybe a possibility for your house 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:54.350
 I would immediately submit that 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.049
 Sofa is okay, you know 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.789

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.350
 clique but also pessimists one is 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.450
 Of course not the project if you have one 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.240
 just nine months to make free 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.800
 but if you are really sooooooooooooooooo here 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.950
 I'm off then they would be 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.230
 There was no money down there either 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.130

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.870
 creativity 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:20.510
 whether pillow fights in san francisco as 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.880
 human sofa in las vegas as 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.890
 athlete at the german ambassador or 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.080

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.380
 dropouts and homeless ways let themselves 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.880
 on their world and learned a lot about 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:05.230
 the topic of money and about yourself 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.250

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.900

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.590
 the world is an exciting self-experiment 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.470
 a reporter's limits 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.020

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.840
