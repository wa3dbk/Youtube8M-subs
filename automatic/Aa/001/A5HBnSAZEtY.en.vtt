00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:09.780
 I deal with windows today 

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:12.300
 8.1 , you are the same as you are 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.890
 bombed with news and he asks 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.609
 surely what is really new about it 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:19.529
 at windows 8.1 compared to windows 8 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:21.779
 and yes there could be enough to read 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.060
 my task or what i give you 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.460
 At least that's what you want to communicate 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.289
 few tips and tricks this in windows 8 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.539
 and 1 compared to windows 8 there 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.489
 So let's start with that 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.059
 splitscreen that is also a 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.410
 innovation 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.390
 but maybe one or the other has 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.030
 not yet figured out that one now 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.000
 also multitasking yes can drive or 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.610
 can customize individual windows 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.420
 we'll just come to the 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.830
 Press the start area like the windows 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.690
 Taste and then we already see the 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.980
 individual tiles 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.360
 Suppose I want any now 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.940
 I can play games there 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.370
 I get on it as usual nothing new 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.400
 understandable if I now too 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.780
 I want to win in Bavaria then I can 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.030
 push on one side 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.280
 and here I can play my players 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.929
 also lure 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.850
 the first innovation that comes here already 

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:10.590
 then at the same time the first tip 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.189
 You can change the windows as you like 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.229
 move 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.479
 Formerly the field was windows 8 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.850
 70 to 30 and now you can too 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.280
 such a small jump or with 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.530
 a double click next to 50 50 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.229
 Create a relationship if I can now 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.509
 not only my players would like to have 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.210
 but also no idea about 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.649
 example surfing the internet then would like 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.270
 I'll click on it if this one already 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.459
 Twice as much back and forth 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.049
 then here you can do it 

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:38.969
 almost throw in between as well 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:43.319
 that means she pulls the windows then 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:45.299
 according to eternal size and then says 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:47.429
 okay you in the middle I can now to 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.700
 for example the pc games hardware website 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:53.100
 exists while I play games and 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.249
 music hears that to 1 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.770
 that can close here under that 

00:01:56.249 --> 00:02:00.359
 here too we go and then 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.999
 we directly on the desktop 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:07.319
 because you will already be my second tip 

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:09.390
 for you and indeed there is now since 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:11.460
 latest the possibility the desktop 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.460
 area also right after the start 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.260
 show 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.150
 earlier in windows 8 will not work yet 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.710
 has formed and he will after the start 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.630
 this window you see so the 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.670
 tiling, so to speak, in the start menu 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.960
 but who immediately thrown on the desktop 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.740
 Of course he can do that too 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.510
 to adjust 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.400
 just do a right click 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.400
 on the taskbar properties 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.710
 pressed and here the second rider 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.610
 we find navigation in here then 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:39.470
 two boxes are not yet hacked 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.690
 the first one when logging in or 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.940
 close all apps instead of the 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.560
 home page view the desktop so 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.360
 exactly what they actually meant 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.290
 anyway, already 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.420
 were used to 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.460
 there in the hook purely and still does 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.830
 take over once the tires are easy 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.810
 have restarted once or your pc 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.250
 drive down and then again one 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.770
 another day the pc completely times 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.680
 the desktop will boot up 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.060
 sting in the eye and not the 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.900
 start page 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.580
 now I said two 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.650
 boxes are not yet unpacked yes 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.060
 There is also still a desktop background 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.820
 Show the home page 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.980
 that too is new reason but what 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.500
 hides behind it 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.480
 Now if we go to the start page 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.430
 then we see the tiles we are here 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.380
 in blue and that does not change at all 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.670
 our desktop me personally that it 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.950
 my opinion marx if everything is beautiful 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.450
 is consistent and that's why I think 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.610
 The function also great with windows 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.230
 8 1 I'll just click this one now 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.810
 button here desktop background on the 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.610
 home view power take over and 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.720
 already I can almost my wallpaper here 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.820
 anything that I have selected and 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.740
 as a background firm court yes 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.590
 also here on the homepage 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:51.530
 are also that easy as a useful tip 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.810
 we are here for you 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.760
 On it you can get the tiles now 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.090
 also assign to corresponding groups 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.940
 quasi within the windows 8.0 possesses 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.290
 So windows 8 in general knows the 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.560
 These tile that you can move them 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.970
 can hoppala from here to there yet 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.400
 times in quickly tapped yes or here 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.130
 this direction is everything 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.260
 possible but now you can the groups 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.239
 you also have names to share 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:22.500
 a right click pulls down here 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:25.500
 customize and can be up here then 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:36.960
 choose no idea standard 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:39.330
 applications and here my favorite and 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.520
 confirm immediately with enter and another 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.830
 you already have it 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.540
 a small grouping made around 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.440
 to find your way around faster 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:51.360
 the start menu at your tiles 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.670
 another point of me then again 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.110
 was missing and as a tip of mine 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:05:01.790
 page comes is the libraries in 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:04.380
 It was customary for windows 8 files 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.919
 also went fast with windows 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.400
 nt 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:10.890
 then I can show better here on the 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.330
 page libraries had mine 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.870
 entire pictures my entire 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:17.250
 music files or other files 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.140
 just these libraries have bundled 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.000
 and they are not there anymore 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.500
 but no reason to worry you can 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.770
 set it again and click it 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.440
 Just click on options and options 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.150
 Here we find the point 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.440
 Show libraries you push that 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.000
 long on the side then you see that 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.800
 what's on the left turn 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.800
 happened to make the hook-pure 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.980
 and press take over and talk 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:45.070
 there are already the libraries again 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:47.140
 with the bundled pictures and files 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:51.880
 which is just on my entire 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:55.150
 Distribute computers I hope the tips 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:58.450
 and tricks so to have windows 8 and 1 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:00.940
 you a little bit helped me 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.530
 Of course, I would be happy if I could 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.760
 few comments from you could see 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.380
 talking under this video 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.910
 maybe you have some more yourself 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.880
 Other tips and tricks stock the 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.870
