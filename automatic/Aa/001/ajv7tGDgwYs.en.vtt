00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
believe so it's just a virtual machine

you're running on this on a separate
computer<00:02:28.350> and<00:02:28.620> it<00:02:29.480> created<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.660> parallels

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
computer and it created a parallels

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.700 
computer and it created a parallels
document<00:02:32.250> on<00:02:32.430> your<00:02:32.490> desktop<00:02:33.380> so<00:02:34.380> now<00:02:34.500> this<00:02:34.650> is

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
you're going to install Windows 7 so

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.700 
you're going to install Windows 7 so
this<00:02:42.120> is<00:02:42.240> what's<00:02:42.360> cool<00:02:42.570> so<00:02:42.840> if<00:02:43.110> you're<00:02:43.290> if<00:02:43.590> you

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
this is what's cool so if you're if you

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.470 
this is what's cool so if you're if you
can't<00:02:43.890> see<00:02:44.010> your<00:02:44.100> mouse<00:02:44.280> whatever<00:02:44.670> you<00:02:45.210> press

control alt our code control option and

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.210 
control alt our code control option and
that<00:02:49.560> will<00:02:50.250> take<00:02:50.520> off<00:02:51.050> take<00:02:52.050> it<00:02:52.080> off<00:02:52.290> of<00:02:52.560> course

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220

this<00:02:53.370> is<00:02:53.520> for<00:02:53.670> mac<00:02:53.850> parallels<00:02:54.330> is<00:02:54.570> for<00:02:54.900> mac<00:02:55.050> I

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
this is for mac parallels is for mac I

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.560 
this is for mac parallels is for mac I
believe<00:02:55.440> also<00:02:56.280> be<00:02:56.400> kind<00:02:56.520> of<00:02:56.640> weird<00:02:56.820> so<00:02:57.540> a

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
parallel is for Mac I don't know if this

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.400 
parallel is for Mac I don't know if this
is<00:02:59.670> going<00:02:59.820> to<00:02:59.880> work<00:02:59.970> for<00:03:00.090> Windows<00:03:00.390> if<00:03:00.660> there<00:03:01.290> is

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
now this could be if you want to install

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.759 
now this could be if you want to install
Windows<00:04:02.850> 8<00:04:03.000> you<00:04:03.690> can<00:04:03.810> do<00:04:03.930> that<00:04:04.110> just<00:04:04.650> by

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
Windows 8 you can do that just by

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.470 
Windows 8 you can do that just by
instead<00:04:05.340> of<00:04:05.459> choosing<00:04:05.670> Windows<00:04:06.000> 7<00:04:06.239> you<00:04:06.360> can

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
instead of choosing Windows 7 you can

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.170 
instead of choosing Windows 7 you can
just<00:04:06.690> go<00:04:06.840> to<00:04:06.900> Windows<00:04:07.320> 8<00:04:07.590> and<00:04:07.830> that<00:04:08.550> would<00:04:08.850> work

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
just go to Windows 8 and that would work

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.690 
just go to Windows 8 and that would work
exactly<00:04:09.570> the<00:04:10.140> same<00:04:10.380> same<00:04:11.040> process<00:04:11.519> same

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
exactly the same same process same

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.070 
exactly the same same process same
everything<00:04:12.090> it's<00:04:12.269> just<00:04:12.330> except<00:04:12.870> it's<00:04:12.989> going

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
everything it's just except it's going

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.120 
everything it's just except it's going
to<00:04:13.170> look<00:04:13.290> different<00:04:13.410> of<00:04:13.709> course<00:04:13.890> it's<00:04:14.070> not

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130
