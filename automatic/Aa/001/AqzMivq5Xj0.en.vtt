original<00:00:30.170> in<00:00:31.170> my<00:00:31.350> opinion<00:00:31.680> this<00:00:31.800> lens<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.309> a

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:32.370 
original in my opinion this lens is a

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:37.310 
original in my opinion this lens is a
tad<00:00:32.910> sharper<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:34.379> is<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.820> tad<00:00:35.820> smaller<00:00:36.290> weighs<00:00:37.290> a

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
tad sharper it is a tad smaller weighs a

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.640 
tad sharper it is a tad smaller weighs a
tad<00:00:37.710> less<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.879> unit<00:00:39.270> ads<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:40.020> is<00:00:40.080> the<00:00:40.470> lens

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:40.650 
tad less so unit ads this is the lens

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.200 
tad less so unit ads this is the lens
for<00:00:40.920> you<00:00:41.070> okay<00:00:41.970> but<00:00:43.070> really<00:00:44.070> honestly<00:00:44.489> the

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
talk about tools that's important first

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.510 
talk about tools that's important first
and<00:01:15.390> foremost<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:16.140> think<00:01:16.680> most<00:01:17.070> people<00:01:17.370> use

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
and foremost I think most people use

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.969 
and foremost I think most people use
this<00:01:17.610> lens<00:01:17.820> totally<00:01:18.630> incorrectly<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.680> what

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
this lens totally incorrectly and what

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:20.920 
this lens totally incorrectly and what
do<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.130> mean<00:01:20.280> by<00:01:20.310> that

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
do I mean by that

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.380 
do I mean by that
well<00:01:21.930> tend<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.460> plant<00:01:23.460> their<00:01:23.610> feet<00:01:23.789> they<00:01:24.210> don't

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
well tend to plant their feet they don't

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.450 
well tend to plant their feet they don't
move<00:01:24.539> baby<00:01:25.079> that<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.469> lens<00:01:25.770> do<00:01:26.070> all<00:01:26.250> the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
move baby that the lens do all the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.300 
move baby that the lens do all the
walking<00:01:26.880> form<00:01:27.240> they<00:01:27.509> zoom<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.289> lens<00:01:28.320> what's

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
walking form they zoom the lens what's

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.209 
walking form they zoom the lens what's
the<00:01:29.369> problem<00:01:29.670> with<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.939> it's<00:01:30.810> 70<00:01:31.649> to<00:01:31.950> 200

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:32.219 
the problem with that it's 70 to 200

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:35.719 
the problem with that it's 70 to 200
millimeters<00:01:33.090> that's<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.350> varying<00:01:34.950> angle<00:01:35.520> of

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
millimeters that's a varying angle of

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.789 
millimeters that's a varying angle of
view<00:01:36.090> that's<00:01:36.930> an<00:01:37.170> angle<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.500> view<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.770> should

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
view that's an angle of view you should

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.560 
view that's an angle of view you should
be<00:01:37.950> putting<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.460> work<00:01:38.670> for<00:01:38.939> your<00:01:39.030> photography

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
be putting to work for your photography

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.499 
be putting to work for your photography
so<00:01:40.490> 70<00:01:41.490> millimeter<00:01:41.789> if<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.030> think<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.359> need

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
so 70 millimeter if you think you need

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.289 
so 70 millimeter if you think you need
steady<00:01:42.869> millimeter<00:01:43.350> zoom<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:44.280> 70<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.850> then

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
steady millimeter zoom to 70 and then

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.520 
steady millimeter zoom to 70 and then
physically<00:01:46.170> move<00:01:46.590> or<00:01:47.009> zoom<00:01:47.670> your<00:01:47.939> feet<00:01:48.350> to<00:01:49.350> get

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
physically move or zoom your feet to get

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.099 
physically move or zoom your feet to get
the<00:01:49.710> image<00:01:50.399> size<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:51.030> composition<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.929> want

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
air you take it off why because the

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.750 
air you take it off why because the
airstream<00:02:46.110> will<00:02:46.260> take<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.680> off<00:02:46.830> okay<00:02:47.340> it's<00:02:47.370> not
