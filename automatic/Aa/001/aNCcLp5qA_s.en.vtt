00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
are fine one injector and two injectors

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.589

we're<00:03:43.590> out<00:03:43.680> of<00:03:43.709> whack<00:03:44.540> the<00:03:45.540> timing<00:03:45.989> belt<00:03:47.599> looks

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
we're out of whack the timing belt looks

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:49.809 
we're out of whack the timing belt looks
good

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
good

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:54.660 
good
basically<00:03:50.780> Aspen's<00:03:51.260> on<00:03:51.409> last<00:03:51.680> filter<00:03:52.430> is<00:03:52.790> good

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
basically Aspen's on last filter is good

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.119 
basically Aspen's on last filter is good
walter<00:03:55.670> is<00:03:55.849> check<00:03:56.599> the<00:03:56.749> air<00:03:56.930> filter<00:03:56.959> in<00:03:57.799> the

00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:58.129 
walter is check the air filter in the

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:02.849 
walter is check the air filter in the
fart<00:03:59.060> box<00:03:59.239> here<00:03:59.620> both<00:04:00.620> of<00:04:00.829> those<00:04:00.920> are<00:04:01.159> clean

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 
fart box here both of those are clean

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:07.690 
fart box here both of those are clean
check<00:04:03.859> the<00:04:04.010> radiator<00:04:04.489> clean<00:04:05.359> and<00:04:05.569> green<00:04:06.700> and

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
check the radiator clean and green and

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.580 
check the radiator clean and green and
basically<00:04:08.299> check<00:04:08.629> for<00:04:08.870> leaks<00:04:08.989> on<00:04:09.230> the<00:04:09.260> bottom

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
basically check for leaks on the bottom

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.750 
basically check for leaks on the bottom
of<00:04:09.650> the<00:04:09.709> car<00:04:09.920> and<00:04:10.099> there<00:04:10.219> was<00:04:10.310> no<00:04:10.489> leaks<00:04:10.750> so

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
of the car and there was no leaks so

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.189 
of the car and there was no leaks so
clean<00:04:12.879> bill<00:04:13.090> of<00:04:13.150> health<00:04:13.950> so<00:04:16.049> that's<00:04:17.049> basically

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 
clean bill of health so that's basically

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:21.009 
clean bill of health so that's basically
what<00:04:17.650> we<00:04:17.739> did<00:04:17.889> first<00:04:18.190> we<00:04:19.030> did<00:04:19.239> the

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
what we did first we did the

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:27.339 
what we did first we did the
we<00:04:21.769> did<00:04:22.009> the<00:04:22.870> diagnostic<00:04:23.870> check<00:04:25.599> for<00:04:26.599> 200<00:04:27.169> and

00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:27.349 
we did the diagnostic check for 200 and

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:30.399 
we did the diagnostic check for 200 and
then<00:04:27.800> basically<00:04:28.009> we<00:04:28.729> found<00:04:28.970> out<00:04:29.240> the<00:04:29.409> couple

00:04:30.399 --> 00:04:30.409 
then basically we found out the couple

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:32.589 
then basically we found out the couple
injectors<00:04:30.949> were<00:04:31.069> bad<00:04:31.310> so<00:04:32.030> then<00:04:32.210> I<00:04:32.360> gave<00:04:32.569> a

00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:32.599 
injectors were bad so then I gave a

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:34.779 
injectors were bad so then I gave a
hundred<00:04:33.080> dollars<00:04:33.379> off<00:04:33.590> and<00:04:33.889> he<00:04:34.039> decided<00:04:34.460> to<00:04:34.610> go

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:34.789 
hundred dollars off and he decided to go

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:37.480 
hundred dollars off and he decided to go

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
with us and change out the injector

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.930 
with us and change out the injector
which<00:04:37.819> he<00:04:38.030> did<00:04:38.270> so<00:04:39.139> we<00:04:39.530> usually<00:04:39.710> charged<00:04:40.430> seven

back together with he gave us the
injectors<00:04:48.470> he<00:04:48.650> bought<00:04:48.860> the<00:04:49.039> injectors<00:04:49.490> had

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
injectors he bought the injectors had

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.600 
injectors he bought the injectors had
him<00:04:50.210> drop<00:04:50.449> shipped<00:04:50.810> here<00:04:51.099> we<00:04:52.099> charged<00:04:52.370> with

job which isn't bad now he's got a whole

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:07.469 
job which isn't bad now he's got a whole
new<00:05:05.720> set<00:05:05.990> of<00:05:06.020> injectors<00:05:06.530> thanks<00:05:06.889> to<00:05:07.009> Bernie

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:07.479 
new set of injectors thanks to Bernie

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:09.999 
new set of injectors thanks to Bernie
Bernie<00:05:08.479> in<00:05:08.690> Virginia<00:05:09.259> supplied<00:05:09.710> through

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:10.009 
Bernie in Virginia supplied through

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:13.399 
Bernie in Virginia supplied through
injectors<00:05:10.789> and

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:13.409 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:17.209 

then<00:05:13.589> we<00:05:13.949> bypass<00:05:14.519> EGR<00:05:15.269> took<00:05:16.110> the<00:05:16.199> EGR<00:05:16.589> totally

00:05:17.209 --> 00:05:17.219 
then we bypass EGR took the EGR totally

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:19.060 
then we bypass EGR took the EGR totally
out

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
out

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.490 
out
and<00:05:19.520> we<00:05:19.640> bypass<00:05:20.120> the<00:05:20.330> water<00:05:20.540> lines<00:05:20.840> so<00:05:21.380> the

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
and we bypass the water lines so the

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.840 
and we bypass the water lines so the
water<00:05:21.710> lines<00:05:21.950> are<00:05:22.130> not<00:05:22.220> going<00:05:22.460> under<00:05:22.760> the

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:22.850 
water lines are not going under the

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.590 
water lines are not going under the
fundamental<00:05:24.370> and<00:05:25.370> we're<00:05:25.550> good<00:05:25.700> to<00:05:25.850> go<00:05:25.880> put<00:05:26.540> it

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
fundamental and we're good to go put it

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.430 
fundamental and we're good to go put it
back<00:05:26.690> on<00:05:26.960> the<00:05:27.050> computer<00:05:27.170> set<00:05:27.800> the<00:05:27.890> TPS<00:05:28.430> again

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
back on the computer set the TPS again

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.390 
back on the computer set the TPS again
and<00:05:30.440> then<00:05:30.710> I<00:05:30.830> came<00:05:30.890> and<00:05:31.400> I<00:05:31.850> timed<00:05:32.570> it<00:05:33.010> may<00:05:34.010> I

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
and then I came and I timed it may I

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.630 
and then I came and I timed it may I
timed<00:05:35.000> it<00:05:35.180> a<00:05:35.240> little<00:05:35.630> a<00:05:35.990> little<00:05:36.410> advance<00:05:37.040> uses

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:37.640 
timed it a little a little advance uses

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.400 
timed it a little a little advance uses
that<00:05:37.760> extra<00:05:38.210> pep<00:05:38.450> to<00:05:38.660> it<00:05:38.780> so<00:05:39.020> I<00:05:39.050> think<00:05:39.170> I've

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
that extra pep to it so I think I've

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.320 
that extra pep to it so I think I've
timed<00:05:39.620> it<00:05:39.830> 17<00:05:40.370> degrees<00:05:40.520> before<00:05:40.910> top<00:05:41.090> dead

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
timed it 17 degrees before top dead

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.650 
timed it 17 degrees before top dead
center<00:05:42.430> other<00:05:43.430> than<00:05:43.670> that<00:05:43.760> check<00:05:44.390> the<00:05:44.510> oil

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
center other than that check the oil

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.900 
center other than that check the oil
