salt to both of these I'm gonna take my
t-shirt<00:01:53.450> and<00:01:53.810> I'm<00:01:53.929> just<00:01:54.079> gonna<00:01:54.259> band<00:01:54.590> it<00:01:54.770> off

t-shirt and I'm just gonna band it off

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.100 
t-shirt and I'm just gonna band it off

with rubber bands just really randomly
in<00:01:57.350> different<00:01:57.799> areas<00:01:58.700> and<00:01:59.119> I'm<00:01:59.990> gonna<00:02:00.200> dip

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
in different areas and I'm gonna dip

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:02.349 
in different areas and I'm gonna dip
half<00:02:00.709> of<00:02:01.069> the<00:02:01.280> t-shirt<00:02:01.579> into<00:02:01.819> the<00:02:01.909> yellow<00:02:02.179> and

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:02.359 
half of the t-shirt into the yellow and

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:06.130 
half of the t-shirt into the yellow and
1/2<00:02:02.569> into<00:02:02.929> the<00:02:03.020> red<00:02:03.200> just<00:02:03.920> like<00:02:04.069> this<00:02:05.140> I'm

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
1/2 into the red just like this I'm

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.199 
1/2 into the red just like this I'm
going<00:02:06.409> to<00:02:06.500> kind<00:02:06.740> of<00:02:06.770> use<00:02:06.979> a<00:02:07.009> spoon<00:02:07.459> to<00:02:07.700> spoon

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
going to kind of use a spoon to spoon

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.539 
going to kind of use a spoon to spoon
off<00:02:08.450> a<00:02:08.599> bit<00:02:08.810> of<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.049> dye<00:02:09.200> onto<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.890> the

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:10.549 
off a bit of the dye onto the the

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:12.220 
off a bit of the dye onto the the
midsection<00:02:11.000> so<00:02:11.239> we<00:02:11.450> get<00:02:11.599> a<00:02:11.630> nice<00:02:11.840> kind<00:02:12.110> of

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
midsection so we get a nice kind of

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.330 
midsection so we get a nice kind of
crossfade<00:02:12.799> between<00:02:13.010> the<00:02:13.340> two<00:02:13.519> colors<00:02:15.340> like

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
crossfade between the two colors like

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.970 
crossfade between the two colors like
this<00:02:16.810> we're<00:02:17.810> also<00:02:18.019> gonna<00:02:18.290> die<00:02:18.530> a<00:02:18.560> little<00:02:18.829> bit

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
this we're also gonna die a little bit

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.789 
this we're also gonna die a little bit
of<00:02:19.220> leftover<00:02:19.670> fabric<00:02:20.410> just<00:02:21.410> because<00:02:21.650> we're

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
of leftover fabric just because we're

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:23.440 
of leftover fabric just because we're
gonna<00:02:21.890> need<00:02:21.980> that<00:02:22.310> later<00:02:22.489> on<00:02:22.760> to<00:02:22.970> be<00:02:23.060> tying<00:02:23.329> a

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
gonna need that later on to be tying a

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.240 
gonna need that later on to be tying a
knot<00:02:23.629> after<00:02:23.930> your<00:02:24.290> dye<00:02:24.470> is<00:02:24.530> finished<00:02:25.010> dyeing

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
knot after your dye is finished dyeing

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.500 
knot after your dye is finished dyeing
we're<00:02:25.519> just<00:02:25.670> gonna<00:02:25.819> rinse<00:02:26.030> it<00:02:26.209> under<00:02:26.269> cold

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
we're just gonna rinse it under cold

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.690 
we're just gonna rinse it under cold
water<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:27.140> then<00:02:27.440> wash<00:02:27.650> it<00:02:27.680> by<00:02:28.010> itself<00:02:28.370> in<00:02:28.610> the

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
water and then wash it by itself in the

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.280 
water and then wash it by itself in the
washing<00:02:29.060> machine<00:02:29.090> I<00:02:29.540> just<00:02:29.720> put<00:02:29.840> it<00:02:29.930> on<00:02:29.959> a<00:02:30.019> short

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
washing machine I just put it on a short

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.020 
washing machine I just put it on a short
cycle<00:02:30.739> for<00:02:30.980> half<00:02:31.160> an<00:02:31.310> hour<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:31.790> we<00:02:31.879> should

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
cycle for half an hour and we should

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.339 
cycle for half an hour and we should
have<00:02:32.120> something<00:02:32.360> looking<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:32.900> little<00:02:32.989> bit<00:02:33.200> like

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
have something looking a little bit like

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.339 
have something looking a little bit like
this<00:02:33.680> so<00:02:34.069> we're<00:02:34.760> going<00:02:34.879> to<00:02:35.000> lay<00:02:35.269> it<00:02:35.420> out<00:02:35.599> and

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
this so we're going to lay it out and

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.229 
this so we're going to lay it out and
with<00:02:36.769> the<00:02:36.950> backside<00:02:37.400> facing<00:02:37.910> us<00:02:38.000> we're<00:02:38.180> gonna

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
with the backside facing us we're gonna

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.330 
with the backside facing us we're gonna
take<00:02:38.569> our<00:02:38.720> needle<00:02:38.900> and<00:02:39.079> thread<00:02:39.380> first<00:02:40.100> we're

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
take our needle and thread first we're

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.039 
take our needle and thread first we're
gonna<00:02:40.489> put<00:02:40.700> some<00:02:40.850> pins<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.450> mark<00:02:41.690> where<00:02:41.959> we

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
gonna put some pins to mark where we

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:43.900 
gonna put some pins to mark where we
want<00:02:42.230> to<00:02:42.380> sew<00:02:42.650> and<00:02:43.010> then<00:02:43.489> we're<00:02:43.609> just<00:02:43.639> gonna

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
want to sew and then we're just gonna

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.479 
want to sew and then we're just gonna
tack<00:02:44.269> really<00:02:44.959> quite<00:02:45.260> large<00:02:45.440> stitches<00:02:46.100> all<00:02:46.280> the

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
tack really quite large stitches all the

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.480 
tack really quite large stitches all the
way<00:02:46.579> across<00:02:46.819> where<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.299> pins<00:02:47.540> are

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
way across where the pins are

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.680 
way across where the pins are
we're<00:02:50.490> not<00:02:50.670> going<00:02:50.880> to<00:02:50.910> tie<00:02:51.090> off<00:02:51.240> at<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.540> other

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
we're not going to tie off at the other

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.080 
we're not going to tie off at the other
end<00:02:52.160> instead<00:02:53.160> we're<00:02:53.340> just<00:02:53.370> going<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:53.730> take<00:02:53.940> out

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
end instead we're just going to take out

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.390 
end instead we're just going to take out
the<00:02:54.240> pins<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:54.840> then<00:02:55.080> we're<00:02:55.230> going<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.500> pull

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
the pins and then we're going to pull

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.270 
the pins and then we're going to pull
the<00:02:56.670> thread<00:02:56.850> so<00:02:57.240> that<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:57.690> fabric<00:02:57.870> gathers

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.380 

what<00:03:02.280> I'm<00:03:02.400> going<00:03:02.580> to<00:03:02.610> do<00:03:02.760> is<00:03:02.880> I'm<00:03:03.030> just<00:03:03.060> going

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
what I'm going to do is I'm just going

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.560 
what I'm going to do is I'm just going
to<00:03:03.540> wrap<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:04.050> thread<00:03:04.320> around<00:03:04.500> once<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:05.790> I'm

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
to wrap the thread around once and I'm

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.470 
to wrap the thread around once and I'm
going<00:03:06.840> to<00:03:06.900> tie<00:03:07.530> off<00:03:07.800> into<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.400> fabric<00:03:08.850> I'm

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
going to tie off into the fabric I'm

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.350 
going to tie off into the fabric I'm
gonna<00:03:10.350> make<00:03:10.530> one<00:03:10.770> stitch<00:03:11.160> and<00:03:11.520> then<00:03:11.850> just<00:03:12.120> tie

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
gonna make one stitch and then just tie

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.690 
gonna make one stitch and then just tie
into<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.930> loop<00:03:13.170> that<00:03:13.470> I've<00:03:13.650> created<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:14.580> that

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
into the loop that I've created and that

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:21.610 
into the loop that I've created and that
will<00:03:15.510> create<00:03:15.780> a<00:03:15.840> knot

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.770 

then<00:03:22.280> you<00:03:22.400> can<00:03:22.610> just<00:03:22.819> cut<00:03:23.060> off<00:03:23.209> the<00:03:23.239> end<00:03:23.540> of<00:03:23.659> the

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
then you can just cut off the end of the

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:24.530 
then you can just cut off the end of the
thread<00:03:24.049> and<00:03:24.110> you

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
thread and you

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.300 
thread and you
for<00:03:24.750> something<00:03:24.989> a<00:03:25.170> little<00:03:25.290> bit<00:03:25.590> like<00:03:25.739> this<00:03:25.950> so

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
for something a little bit like this so

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.429 
for something a little bit like this so
then<00:03:27.030> we're<00:03:27.150> going<00:03:27.269> to<00:03:27.360> use<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.750> fabric<00:03:28.170> the

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:28.439 
then we're going to use the fabric the

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:30.170 
then we're going to use the fabric the
little<00:03:28.680> scrap<00:03:28.980> fabric<00:03:29.159> that<00:03:29.459> I<00:03:29.519> mentioned<00:03:29.879> to

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
little scrap fabric that I mentioned to

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.729 
little scrap fabric that I mentioned to
hide<00:03:30.329> that<00:03:30.510> little<00:03:30.689> bit<00:03:30.900> of<00:03:30.930> thread<00:03:31.290> so<00:03:31.590> we're
