what<00:00:53.460> I've<00:00:53.610> done<00:00:53.879> here<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.480> this<00:00:55.070> wire<00:00:56.070> side<00:00:56.579> is

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
what I've done here is this wire side is

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.590 
what I've done here is this wire side is
on<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.149> south<00:00:57.390> side<00:00:57.920> so<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:58.949> will<00:00:59.309> get<00:00:59.600> the

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
on the south side so that will get the

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.900 
on the south side so that will get the
prevailing<00:01:01.230> southern<00:01:01.530> winds<00:01:01.949> will<00:01:02.160> blow<00:01:02.699> in

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
prevailing southern winds will blow in

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.539 
prevailing southern winds will blow in

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
and cool this structure and then it's

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.870 
and cool this structure and then it's
open<00:01:05.700> at<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.000> top<00:01:06.950> on<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.189> east<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.670> west
