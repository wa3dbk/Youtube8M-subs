bad<00:00:58.320> experience<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.340> have<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.699> say<00:00:59.879> it's

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
bad experience and I have to say it's

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.029 
bad experience and I have to say it's
pretty<00:01:00.329> comfortable<00:01:00.960> but<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.559> did<00:01:01.739> take<00:01:01.770> some

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
pretty comfortable but it did take some

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.609 
pretty comfortable but it did take some
getting<00:01:02.550> used<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.239> picked<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.989> pretty<00:01:04.199> firm

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
getting used to I picked a pretty firm

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.730 
getting used to I picked a pretty firm
model<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:06.150> instead<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.630> kind<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.320> jumping

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
model and so instead of kind of jumping

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.679 
model and so instead of kind of jumping
on<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.040> bed<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.520> just<00:01:08.640> bouncing<00:01:09.210> as<00:01:09.450> one

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
on the bed and just bouncing as one

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.200 
on the bed and just bouncing as one
might<00:01:10.110> with<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.409> typical<00:01:10.619> mattress<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.909> kind

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
might with the typical mattress you kind

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.080 
might with the typical mattress you kind
of<00:01:12.330> get<00:01:12.840> in<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.110> bed<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.619> then<00:01:13.770> slowly<00:01:14.310> sink

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
of get in the bed and then slowly sink

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.270 
of get in the bed and then slowly sink
down<00:01:15.360> my<00:01:15.990> husband<00:01:16.320> said<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.619> other<00:01:16.710> day<00:01:16.860> it

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
down my husband said the other day it

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.249 
down my husband said the other day it
was<00:01:17.310> like<00:01:17.580> sleeping<00:01:18.119> on<00:01:18.210> blue<00:01:18.450> block<00:01:18.689> which<00:01:19.080> I

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
was like sleeping on blue block which I

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.530 
was like sleeping on blue block which I
had<00:01:19.470> once<00:01:19.680> compared<00:01:20.159> this<00:01:20.340> technology<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.119> in

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
had once compared this technology to in

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.560 
had once compared this technology to in
terms<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.229> non-newtonian<00:01:22.830> fluids<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.060> things

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
terms of non-newtonian fluids and things

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.450 
terms of non-newtonian fluids and things
like<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:24.810> I'll<00:01:25.409> get<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:25.830> at<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.189> end<00:01:26.340> of

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
like that I'll get to that at the end of

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.760 
like that I'll get to that at the end of
the<00:01:26.520> video<00:01:26.640> if<00:01:26.970> there's<00:01:27.150> time<00:01:27.500> let<00:01:28.500> me<00:01:28.590> show

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
the video if there's time let me show

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.370 
the video if there's time let me show
you<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.460> motion<00:01:29.850> perfect<00:01:30.240> base<00:01:30.479> it

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
you this the motion perfect base it

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.230 
you this the motion perfect base it
comes<00:01:31.740> with<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.009> remote<00:01:32.280> control<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:33.090> that

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
comes with the remote control so that

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.859 
comes with the remote control so that
you<00:01:33.479> can<00:01:33.689> raise<00:01:33.900> your<00:01:34.110> feet<00:01:34.850> or<00:01:35.850> your<00:01:35.909> head<00:01:36.570> or

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
you can raise your feet or your head or

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.450 
you can raise your feet or your head or
I'm<00:01:36.900> going<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.320> go<00:01:37.439> into<00:01:37.619> something<00:01:37.920> called<00:01:38.250> 0g

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
I'm going to go into something called 0g

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.580 
I'm going to go into something called 0g
so<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.490> just<00:01:41.790> lay<00:01:42.150> back<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.450> let<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.320> bed<00:01:43.560> you

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
so I just lay back and let the bed you

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.440 
so I just lay back and let the bed you
all<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.430> work<00:01:45.649> my<00:01:46.649> back<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:46.920> going<00:01:47.430> up<00:01:47.610> my<00:01:48.180> feet

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
all the work my back is going up my feet

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.510 
all the work my back is going up my feet
are<00:01:48.570> going<00:01:48.780> up<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.649> think<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:50.009> position

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
are going up and I think this position

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.399 
are going up and I think this position
is<00:01:50.700> really<00:01:51.030> great<00:01:51.299> in<00:01:51.540> terms<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.960> just<00:01:52.200> taking
