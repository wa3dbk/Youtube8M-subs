don't get on this one this one sin and

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.280 
don't get on this one this one sin and
the<00:03:34.820> reason<00:03:35.180> is<00:03:35.360> the<00:03:35.660> maintenance

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
the reason is the maintenance

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.510 
the reason is the maintenance
maintenance<00:03:36.920> maintenance<00:03:37.850> um<00:03:39.520> the

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
maintenance maintenance um the

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.280 
maintenance maintenance um the
maintenance<00:03:40.820> of<00:03:41.120> the<00:03:41.270> board<00:03:41.570> is<00:03:41.900> a<00:03:42.230> bitch

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
maintenance of the board is a bitch

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:52.660 
maintenance of the board is a bitch
because<00:03:46.180> it's<00:03:47.180> really<00:03:50.170> ridiculous<00:03:51.170> and<00:03:51.950> it

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
because it's really ridiculous and it

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.850 
because it's really ridiculous and it
really<00:03:52.940> takes<00:03:53.180> me<00:03:53.270> like<00:03:53.480> 30<00:03:53.959> minutes<00:03:54.440> for<00:03:54.680> each

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
really takes me like 30 minutes for each

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.790 
really takes me like 30 minutes for each
truck<00:03:55.340> to<00:03:55.489> clean<00:03:55.730> and<00:03:56.540> to<00:03:56.570> put<00:03:57.470> back<00:03:57.590> together

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
truck to clean and to put back together

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.320 
truck to clean and to put back together
and<00:04:00.280> move<00:04:01.280> it<00:04:01.489> up<00:04:01.640> which<00:04:01.970> i<00:04:02.120> think<00:04:02.180> is

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
and move it up which i think is

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.210 
and move it up which i think is
ridiculous<00:04:02.930> um<00:04:03.670> you<00:04:04.670> can<00:04:04.820> only<00:04:05.030> use<00:04:05.209> a<00:04:06.220> excuse

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
ridiculous um you can only use a excuse

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.449 
ridiculous um you can only use a excuse
me<00:04:07.370> white<00:04:08.030> lithium<00:04:08.239> grease<00:04:08.480> and<00:04:09.310> that's<00:04:10.310> a<00:04:10.430> bad

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
me white lithium grease and that's a bad

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.180 
me white lithium grease and that's a bad
that's<00:04:10.910> not<00:04:11.450> very<00:04:11.660> convenient<00:04:12.110> because<00:04:12.440> when

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
that's not very convenient because when

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.350 
that's not very convenient because when
you're<00:04:13.310> using<00:04:13.520> white<00:04:13.760> leather<00:04:13.940> burgers<00:04:14.239> you

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
you're using white leather burgers you

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.460 
you're using white leather burgers you
later<00:04:14.570> they<00:04:14.690> have<00:04:14.780> to<00:04:14.870> take<00:04:15.050> a<00:04:15.080> whole<00:04:15.320> thing

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
later they have to take a whole thing

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.099 
later they have to take a whole thing
apart<00:04:15.790> so<00:04:16.790> that<00:04:16.820> means<00:04:17.060> you<00:04:17.150> have<00:04:17.239> to<00:04:17.299> take<00:04:17.870> out

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
apart so that means you have to take out

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.789 
apart so that means you have to take out
the<00:04:18.650> wave<00:04:18.859> cams<00:04:19.600> springs<00:04:20.600> all<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.109> washers

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
the wave cams springs all the washers

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.409 
the wave cams springs all the washers
all<00:04:22.640> that<00:04:23.180> used<00:04:23.390> to<00:04:23.570> move<00:04:23.870> the<00:04:23.900> head<00:04:24.410> and<00:04:25.419> even

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
all that used to move the head and even

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.030 
all that used to move the head and even
us<00:04:26.570> think<00:04:27.050> that's<00:04:27.169> a<00:04:27.229> lot<00:04:27.410> but<00:04:28.340> I<00:04:28.640> found<00:04:29.030> with<00:04:29.330> a

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
us think that's a lot but I found with a

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.860 
us think that's a lot but I found with a
with<00:04:30.520> original<00:04:31.060> trucks<00:04:31.330> you<00:04:31.480> get<00:04:31.600> a<00:04:31.630> lot<00:04:31.840> of

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
with original trucks you get a lot of

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.870 
with original trucks you get a lot of
black<00:04:32.350> gunk<00:04:33.100> grease<00:04:34.170> for<00:04:35.170> no<00:04:35.320> reason<00:04:35.830> and<00:04:36.040> it

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
black gunk grease for no reason and it

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.620 
black gunk grease for no reason and it
takes<00:04:37.210> a<00:04:37.300> lot<00:04:37.540> of<00:04:37.570> wiping<00:04:38.170> with<00:04:38.950> Clorox<00:04:39.640> like

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630
