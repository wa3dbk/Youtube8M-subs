 Execution is not in issue in the home Kumamoto Suizenji Stadium 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:03.340
 This time the 10th midfielder Yuko Yuzuhito enthusiasm was enraged for this Belgium match 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.340
 Was 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.660
 The other day of the Shonan warfare I was one leg of facing a team of 12 in-game winning streak Well do from now to the home 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.270
 But 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:17.260
 Frank impression 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:19.400
 Well it is after all I think was strong and Do It But I thought such a feeling has been going chagrin 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.840
 After all it is strong 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:29.500
 I think that want Masanao Hayata I want to see live, such as redo Well 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:32.590
 By the way, which bust has scored 15 goals so far this season so far 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:36.920
 A player in the middle of this is involved 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.130
 The scene I'm worried about a bit, but I would like five people to comment 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.910
 First of all 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:44.650
 I love the ball of the opening round Fukuoka Battle Katayama 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.200
 Kedomo we do that free kick was also great 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.489
 Yam's 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:53.270
 Put Because it is acting so any stake character 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:56.840
 No, it is important'm Well Arewa 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:04:00.250
 After doing Tteyuu Yappa do with quite do it 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.250
 I feel a sense of shame 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:23.740
 It is beginning to say boo, and Patinho パ テ ィ is of strategy 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:25.500
 It was the increase of mousse of the player of the ball that there is a ball of Sarah player 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.080
 Beginning this year 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.230
 w is throwing 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.320
 At first we went today but 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:38.210
 I am happy and say Well entering a Yappa one 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:39.840
 It is what from Hana Kato coach so it seems so super 3 minutes like to throw next year from the end of last year 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.020
 Be told kidding 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.919
 Say goodbye not to throw 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:49.220
 Softening is that I have something to that practice was saying to the bush player but I was successful 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:54.770
 Such as it is the long-throw 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:59.520
 I was throwing up to school, but a professional player is not going to long me to see a long throw 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:02.669
 It is Tan to say I do not cut kana say much sealed and I think 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:07.889
 Somewhat fun Ruda-like information 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:12.419
 Gum or Shy if it was done If you throw it well it was fine once and for all who was good 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:15.529
 And this season's first goal for players who play Sapporo season 12 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:21.210
 That's from the corner kick of Nakayama 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:26.090
 So-called high sign play so the first sign of the star is broken 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:31.040
 However, there is a strength at the head of the mountain, but it seems that there is no form 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:32.139
 However, I do n't feel like talking to the user when it's just that true momentary inspiration 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.490
 In 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:38.980
 I think it is a great set play strength 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:42.550
 I think that it is the issue that goes around quite well . 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:46.930
 Oh, I really have a chance from the set play this season too 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:48.510
 Or Wakan precaution Well and what's what for I thought looking but so is those who are doing it so 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:52.650
 In I think 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:57.990
 Wow I think Well maybe from this well and the number or rather made to the husband and wife will increase 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:58.830
 Well, the next game is a match with Tokyo Belgium at home, but it has some kind of impression 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.660
 Is it 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:04.560
 I think I thought the team you are in Anna at'm strong team since I was little bitty Te workshop 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.210
 It is no 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:13.289
 I have high Bible ability 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:15.400
 After all I would like to say that there is a way to look at the current order. 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:21.980
 Well sound medicine department 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:25.610

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:29.950
