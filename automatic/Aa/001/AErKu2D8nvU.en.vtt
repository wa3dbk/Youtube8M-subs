00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.870
 97 a little more back in the main class 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.560
 they were already there for a year low levels of direct degradation 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:13.380
 so returned again 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.329
 almost all highest every hour level 

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:19.759
 jodan boys the team from gouda is new in the big league a 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:23.179
 and the two seasons for those wrong in the big league b 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:26.339
 so have to make the switch 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:29.339
 we came a cio dan boys 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.019
 it looks equally dangerous to have to advance the defense of advances 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:35.530
 intervene 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.950
 the smallest 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.050
 but the violation so free kick in the first minute of the match 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.050
 for jodan boys 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.450
 according to the ball where is the man of the free kicks 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.550
 good and advanced techniques 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.480
 goals for jodan boys 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.200
 9 3 then you can say that the defense of presents not quite yet 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.980
 waking up is stopping 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.670
 the evening is exactly where the research council is if you support it 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.080
 Magazines 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.080
 beh and this evening it finishes 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.370
 go crazy 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.370
 and that is a disappointment for the van Hein van Hake team 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.430
 the teams were nice shot 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.480
 Outside of the foot 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.340
 thought next to the intersection 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.520
 crossing over 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.890
 last week a draw for both teams both scary 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.549
 of course, I wanted to advance the examples in the first 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.040
 home game against nec the head is tricky 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.450
 and then this is viewed before 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.660
 but just not good enough 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.660
 popper sheds 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.480
 jodan boys after a lightning-fast counter 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.560
 beh 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.160
 search for a country 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.160
 And that feels like this is Peter Graafland, by the way 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.880
 3 yes advanced combo better in the game where may I still have 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.850
 the more reason to play more smartly what the bulb employee does 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.899
 that is true but true 

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:22.409
 miranda good movement bursts put the green yes that was there 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.659
 no one for the goal 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:29.079
 with pain and effort the ball in that ball still gets insufficient votes to finish it 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:33.279
 make sand mountains miranda decision 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:40.090
 pressure is increasing the movement is a lot less often that in the past 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.000
 3 then it's the danger gone for meant to be jodan boys 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.819
 had more residents 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.079
 jodan boys 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:01.689
 perhaps a dangerous moment header from countland has advanced 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:03.160
 actually the most ball possession 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.749
 at the better chances for jodan boys 

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:08.749
 the spindle 0 they commute towards the canteen 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:15.949
 second half 

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:18.249
 and the rescue of keemink 

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:21.249
 on the deployment of, among other things, a fire 

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:26.059
 he could have just been 2 0 that was the game played 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:29.959
 aprons turn on 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.499
 8 that there is a dot in it 

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:36.579
 but where is the opening that white wall bugs tries it from distance 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.619
 fall through the basket 

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:42.829
 As the competition progressed we are heading for more and more information 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:44.049
 play 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.909
 where it started as a central defender 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:50.219
 miranda cannot benefit from a mistake by michael de leeuw 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:54.359
 not this 

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:57.869
 I still want to catch up on advances 

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:03.259
 Peter Graafland pulled in well again 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:08.049
 Hamas is pretty free to get a shot 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:13.179
 what can aprons to drink to 

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:16.179
 miranda has speed 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:20.849
 it is good to pull in 

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:22.969
 yes then you should be lucky 

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:24.719
 what are touched 

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:27.849
 is from substitute bass mauritz it does deliver a corner 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:31.669
 the public believes in order 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.539
 a draw is really only where it is going you will not save it 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:37.210
 to buy 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.460
 small objection of distance do 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.460
 in the rebound gadget 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.740
 jazz a dome over the leak 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.849
 final phase of the competition Jelle Korbee has now fallen seven 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:56.620
 running during rush hour 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.620
 days before the war in the sixteen worries 

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:03.629
 we are mother borrowed money 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.370
 el bouazatti the possibility 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.130
 jodan boys hardly have an attacker in the second half 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:15.699
 so advance payments actually deserve 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:16.990
 that equalizer 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.990
 duplication pass remains 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:23.039
 the blame but always 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:26.039
 the ambulance was in the field 

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:29.259
 mt 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:32.259
 substitute bass construction fair finishes it off 

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:39.680
 what is your opinion 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.840
 and then there is such a thing as justice in sport 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.150
 still going to do something on last referee last 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.509
 he does that 

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:53.509
 a justified result will be issued on 31 December 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:58.800
 But look at themselves considerably larger than the emissions also know the suspicion 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.550
 exists that you occur in the garden from the first minute than the 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.870
 In addition, advances often have to do more attacking a lot more 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.650
 forward teams will also automatically call other teams on you backwards and forwards 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.530
 then you get such a competition in which the objective spectator is one year ahead 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.509
 Schouten who is up to Puncho is perhaps also so on the other side 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:18.789
 if he just airs from the seven behind options we get to one 

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:21.669
 put down a good counter he did his good thing that we didn't do 

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:24.669
 still have our problem on all roads where we do it goes with him 

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:29.319
 well I think everyone in that lens can already be seen 

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:34.659
 but I have to try to play a game the market itself turns red at the 

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:38.870
 first goal a his game take the money 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.700
 for the trainer to change the striker fortunately gets index on the nose 

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:45.729
 moreover on the day my team 

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:48.650
 I still think I have a trainer from the Alkmaarders spokesperson
