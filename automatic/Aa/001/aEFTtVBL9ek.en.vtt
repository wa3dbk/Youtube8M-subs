00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.709 
cape I could have given him a much
better<00:02:04.069> look<00:02:04.549> but<00:02:04.879> it<00:02:05.000> seems<00:02:05.209> they<00:02:05.360> just<00:02:05.539> took

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
better look but it seems they just took

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.259 
better look but it seems they just took
the<00:02:05.929> lazy<00:02:06.259> way<00:02:06.649> out<00:02:06.890> hopefully<00:02:07.429> he'll<00:02:07.819> make<00:02:08.060> up

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
the lazy way out hopefully he'll make up

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.300 
the lazy way out hopefully he'll make up
for<00:02:08.599> it<00:02:08.690> by<00:02:08.810> having<00:02:09.110> some<00:02:09.349> great<00:02:09.590> stats<00:02:10.069> and

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
for it by having some great stats and

for it by having some great stats and
abilities<00:02:10.399> I<00:02:11.150> guess<00:02:11.480> that's<00:02:11.720> something<00:02:11.900> we'll

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
abilities I guess that's something we'll

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.040 
abilities I guess that's something we'll
have<00:02:12.290> to<00:02:12.560> just<00:02:12.739> wait<00:02:12.950> and<00:02:13.190> find<00:02:13.400> out

like a lot of the others they could have

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.300 
like a lot of the others they could have
given<00:05:18.720> them<00:05:18.900> a<00:05:19.020> body<00:05:19.229> with<00:05:19.500> more<00:05:19.680> jewels<00:05:20.039> on<00:05:20.280> it

still<00:06:27.800> if<00:06:28.040> they're<00:06:28.310> going<00:06:28.550> to<00:06:28.640> give<00:06:28.760> slow

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
still if they're going to give slow

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.580 
still if they're going to give slow
burrow<00:06:29.330> mega<00:06:29.630> evolution<00:06:30.200> they<00:06:30.320> may<00:06:30.440> as<00:06:30.500> well

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:30.590 
burrow mega evolution they may as well

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.710 
burrow mega evolution they may as well
give<00:06:30.860> slow<00:06:31.220> King<00:06:31.550> one<00:06:31.790> as<00:06:31.940> well<00:06:32.180> to<00:06:32.390> even<00:06:32.630> the

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 
give slow King one as well to even the

give slow King one as well to even the
playing<00:06:32.990> field<00:06:33.140> I<00:06:33.770> can<00:06:34.040> just<00:06:34.190> picture<00:06:34.460> it<00:06:34.670> now

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:34.760 
playing field I can just picture it now

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.700 
playing field I can just picture it now
this<00:06:35.480> Pokemon<00:06:35.900> might<00:06:36.050> actually<00:06:36.230> turn<00:06:36.650> out

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:36.710 
this Pokemon might actually turn out

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.040 
this Pokemon might actually turn out
well<00:06:37.130> as<00:06:37.400> a<00:06:37.430> defensive<00:06:38.000> wall<00:06:38.270> so<00:06:38.600> at<00:06:38.720> least<00:06:38.840> it

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050 
well as a defensive wall so at least it

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.020 
well as a defensive wall so at least it
could<00:06:39.200> have<00:06:39.350> that<00:06:39.380> going<00:06:39.920> for<00:06:40.160> it<00:06:40.190> however<00:06:40.820> he

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:41.030 
could have that going for it however he

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:42.910 
could have that going for it however he
would<00:06:41.120> still<00:06:41.420> be<00:06:41.540> slower<00:06:41.900> than<00:06:42.230> most<00:06:42.410> Pokemon

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:42.920 
would still be slower than most Pokemon

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.610 
would still be slower than most Pokemon
