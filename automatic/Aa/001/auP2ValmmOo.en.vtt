00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.240
 hi everybody jackson themselves and today will be 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.549
 Another review of the package that I 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:18.090
 came a bunch of shop called 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:20.460
 miniinthebox and let's open it 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.080
 Here, in principle , the mc edge can be said 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.090
 I want to note that the mail is 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.770
 somehow not neatly painful 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.360
 pretty sealed this 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.060
 somehow opened carelessly wonderful 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:33.200
 clash a bit did not like and what with 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.200
 sending everything ok 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:49.819
 toreza so as not to damage 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:56.399
 so this is our adapter 

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:58.260
 with ps2 ps3 on the hut and now small 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.409
 there will be a pause since i will need to 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.879
 open and in general I opened it 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:05.489
 because here she was pretty 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.440
 tightly packed as you can see right here 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.480
 she just so I on time video well 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.440
 much too much time spent on it 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.260
 poets therefore 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.180
 part I cut a little so let's say and 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.700
 give since now you see here 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.130
 such a joke but inside is empty here we are 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.470
 see what you can with ps2 but the joystick even 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.090
 from ps1 is also a good fit 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.000
 switch to ps3 and also she 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.160
 suitable for computers so here we have 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.440
 ps3 is drawn what else is so big 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.680
 old apparently and let's see what 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.080
 there for an adapter 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.170
 I do not know such an adapter 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.630
 not seen here from a simple such as 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.360
 you know who had a sanka 1 2 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.880
 here's the course on the track so change 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.670
 joysticks and go to beat here with us and 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.300
 convent itself and here's such a thing 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.220
 principle 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.230
 ordered since i have some 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.180
 all sorts of accessories for no extra 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.430
 There are a couple of accessories that I would like to 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.950
 use on computer and therefore 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.170
 said something that was inexpensive helped or 4 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.990
 just a dollar but that's such an interesting 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.619
 the thing is basically quality 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.290
 OK, everything is done, no complaints 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.790
 only that the wire is a bit short but 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.650
 Essentially all the same joystick too long 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.379
 wire so with 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.500
 This adapter should be enough for 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:23.780
 beaten and in general that such here was a review 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.849
 with you was jackson sign and bet 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.829
 likes it was ordered meneza box 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.829
 dot com we are in general that while
