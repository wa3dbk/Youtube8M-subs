00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
now first you're gonna make horizontal

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.300 
now first you're gonna make horizontal
slices<00:01:12.950> across<00:01:13.640> the<00:01:13.850> onion<00:01:14.150> just<00:01:14.690> like<00:01:14.900> this

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.120 
root depending on how big you want your

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.850 
root depending on how big you want your
pieces<00:01:20.300> will<00:01:20.780> depend<00:01:21.080> on<00:01:21.170> how<00:01:21.380> many<00:01:21.590> slices

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
pieces will depend on how many slices

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.370 
pieces will depend on how many slices
you<00:01:22.100> make<00:01:22.250> once<00:01:23.210> you<00:01:23.330> have<00:01:23.450> that<00:01:23.660> done<00:01:23.900> you're

again the closer the slice the smaller

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.980 
again the closer the slice the smaller
the<00:01:29.690> chop<00:01:29.900> will<00:01:30.110> be<00:01:31.570> once<00:01:32.570> you've<00:01:32.750> created
