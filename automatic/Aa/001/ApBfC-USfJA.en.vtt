00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.400
 good day legs like chmod 755 mp 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:24.449
 and the blue series is such a dull series 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:26.730
 Traditionally in this box pouch well 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:31.039
 This knife did not always resemble such 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.039
 small compact tank 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:42.380
 very thick grip 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:45.120
 according to its castle structure 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.340
 frame locke titanium free blog this 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:54.680
 Now such a fashionable design 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:57.570
 titanium preposition with fashionable steel m 390 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.960
 design and tires 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:06.840
 Siebert but the Americans pronounce his name 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:12.420
 like zaybert and cyber zaybert with this 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:15.390
 sides such a logo here and a stove 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.360
 dollars and in principle then maybe they 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.500
 slightly ease the blade and such 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.840
 designer course straight descents 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:33.030
 from about half from the middle of a little 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:36.690
 maybe more than the middle here 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.000
 that's interesting so interesting 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.100
 configuration 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.840
 to the interesting structure of the castle that is here 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.360
 he turns out a flight which 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.950
 prevent him from leaving at all 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.240
 opposite to the liner but also it is clear that 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.110
 this one 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.259
 the handle mostly consists of 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.810
 green g10 so grooved 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:05.329
 very very tenacious this here 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:08.750
 part here this part is turned 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:11.670
 You need to milled unenviable here 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.250
 either but there in general there is nothing inside 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.670
 no no no no this metal 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:21.120
 no side it's pure g10 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:27.239
 green here it turns out occitan 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:29.880
 and on top of such a g10 nakladochka on 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:33.739
 titan you it turns out so here is the cut 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.690
 the mode is very very easy to be easy 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:42.470
 shoots visible so that this one here 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:46.860
 the part is thin enough that's why 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:50.880
 no such a super strong super 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.920
 a lot of effort on the spring no clip 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.160
 also titanium and here it is only in this 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:00.120
 the position is nowhere else to rearrange 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:03.769
 lanyard hole can not be enough 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.959
 small design on the bargaining sah 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:11.150
 let's help this six 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:14.810
 maybe eight or ten very 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:18.540
 interesting feature is this one here 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:23.430
 stop pin if you see him 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:25.950
 there are different faces and these faces serve 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:33.120
 In general, this device is used to 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:37.470
 order to fit or maybe 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.000
 to be then in other words if take off to 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.660
 to face 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.530
 unscrew here here under the clip 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.890
 debts that keeps this 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:52.020
 this thing and crank it 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.020
 this next face will change 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.650
 locking the lock here, that is, it will 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.480
 either I sooner or later and so on then 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.120
 There is in other words, if how much 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.420
 time due to working out will it be 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.480
 you can always go farther 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.730
 earn some money with this one 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:14.620
 here is this pin 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:18.160
 stop and this is my personal opinion here 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:21.430
 such parts must be equipped with all knives 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:25.780
 from titanium to frame locke and that is because 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:29.350
 what is well in this wildly competently and most 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:32.560
 problems associated with titanium sejm 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.330
 curl inside riding this thing here 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.790
 maybe it is patented I don't know 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.710
 honestly maybe nobody can 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:46.979
 to do it because here in the Maidan Bank 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:50.950
 he has a patent here I can not say legs 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:53.610
 small in size i.e. brick from 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.610
 need to look 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:07.060
 look means total length is about 18 7 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:16.960
 less than 18 millimeters 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:16.960
 centimeters blade length somewhere in the area 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:24.260
 Well, all and a half is not possible 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:27.770
 look at tth according to data through it 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.900
 a small one of this one 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.180
 it seemed to me that he would be uncomfortable but 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.220
 on the contrary he is good but very good 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:41.330
 fills the palms exactly fine in hand 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:43.610
 sits here top notch notch not 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:47.800
 aggressive very so crap 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:51.050
 In principle, it resembles a notch on xm 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:54.170
 eighteenth from Hender is not quite so 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:59.420
 what it looks like it looks like that too 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:06:04.820
 they are not too aggressive 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:07.550
 knife basically knife fashionable execution in 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:13.280
 fashion bench from the famous manufacturer 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:16.210
 ben hit in general, such is the thing thanks 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.210
 for attention bye
