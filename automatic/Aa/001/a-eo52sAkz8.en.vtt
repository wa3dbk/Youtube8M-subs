00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:59.859 
to the end of the board now we're gonna
make<00:01:53.070> little<00:01:53.420> mountains

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
see what their level is at but maybe

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.160 
see what their level is at but maybe
that's<00:02:15.360> one<00:02:15.600> little<00:02:15.750> eye<00:02:15.900> here<00:02:17.930> okay<00:02:18.930> then

we<00:02:43.620> can<00:02:43.650> do<00:02:44.069> it<00:02:44.190> however<00:02:44.430> you<00:02:44.760> like<00:02:44.850> it's<00:02:45.300> just

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
we can do it however you like it's just

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:54.440 
we can do it however you like it's just
okay<00:02:48.360> we<00:02:48.720> have<00:02:48.930> straight<00:02:52.340> okay<00:02:53.370> like<00:02:53.730> this<00:02:53.970> now

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
okay we have straight okay like this now

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.340 
okay we have straight okay like this now
my<00:02:55.260> little<00:02:55.440> girl<00:02:55.800> she<00:02:56.400> sees<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.330> lines<00:02:57.569> of

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
my little girl she sees the lines of

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.330 
my little girl she sees the lines of
vertical<00:02:58.980> lines<00:02:59.299> the<00:03:00.299> lines<00:03:00.540> going<00:03:00.840> down<00:03:01.340> down

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
vertical lines the lines going down down

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.600 
vertical lines the lines going down down
down<00:03:02.720> so<00:03:03.720> we<00:03:03.840> write<00:03:04.049> them<00:03:04.260> together<00:03:04.489> with<00:03:05.489> our

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
down so we write them together with our

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.920 
down so we write them together with our
little<00:03:05.850> fingers<00:03:06.269> damn

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
little fingers damn

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.449 
little fingers damn
damn<00:03:08.140> now<00:03:08.560> we're<00:03:08.799> gonna<00:03:08.920> turn<00:03:09.159> them<00:03:09.430> and

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
damn now we're gonna turn them and

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.250 
damn now we're gonna turn them and
you're<00:03:09.760> gonna<00:03:09.849> turn<00:03:10.180> it<00:03:10.420> so<00:03:10.720> she<00:03:10.810> has<00:03:11.019> to<00:03:11.110> hold

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
you're gonna turn it so she has to hold

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.679 
you're gonna turn it so she has to hold
on<00:03:11.379> to<00:03:11.470> your<00:03:11.560> little<00:03:11.680> fingers<00:03:12.129> and<00:03:12.450> she<00:03:13.450> has<00:03:13.540> to

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:13.689 
on to your little fingers and she has to

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:20.369 
on to your little fingers and she has to
maybe<00:03:13.870> pull<00:03:14.079> across<00:03:15.870> across<00:03:16.870> across<00:03:19.319> so<00:03:20.319> she

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:20.379 
maybe pull across across across so she

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:22.679 
maybe pull across across across so she
takes<00:03:20.709> her<00:03:20.860> little<00:03:21.129> fingers<00:03:21.549> and<00:03:21.579> pincers<00:03:22.360> is

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:22.689 
takes her little fingers and pincers is

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:25.470 
takes her little fingers and pincers is
very<00:03:22.930> good<00:03:23.200> for<00:03:23.379> her<00:03:24.159> at<00:03:24.489> all<00:03:24.640> fingers<00:03:25.150> and

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
very good for her at all fingers and

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.500 
very good for her at all fingers and
coordination<00:03:26.379> and<00:03:27.099> writing<00:03:27.489> practice<00:03:27.970> and

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
coordination and writing practice and

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.819 
coordination and writing practice and
she<00:03:29.230> made<00:03:29.439> her<00:03:29.560> lines<00:03:29.799> go<00:03:30.099> across<00:03:31.109> across<00:03:32.109> so

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
she made her lines go across across so

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.179 
she made her lines go across across so
you<00:03:32.890> can<00:03:33.189> learn<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.400> vocabulary<00:03:33.790> words<00:03:35.189> up

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:36.189 
you can learn the vocabulary words up

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:39.690 
you can learn the vocabulary words up
and<00:03:36.609> down<00:03:36.819> across<00:03:37.510> laying<00:03:38.409> down<00:03:38.739> vertical

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
and down across laying down vertical

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.319 
and down across laying down vertical
horizontal<00:03:41.670> that's<00:03:42.670> what<00:03:42.849> we<00:03:42.940> do<00:03:43.120> with<00:03:43.180> our

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
horizontal that's what we do with our

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:46.559 
horizontal that's what we do with our
little<00:03:43.629> lines<00:03:44.049> our<00:03:44.650> middle<00:03:45.060> these<00:03:46.060> are<00:03:46.269> just

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
little lines our middle these are just

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:47.970 
little lines our middle these are just
little<00:03:47.170> pipe<00:03:47.500> chips

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
little pipe chips

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.420 
little pipe chips
pipe<00:03:48.280> cleaners<00:03:48.549> dipped<00:03:49.030> that<00:03:49.299> I've<00:03:49.420> cut<00:03:49.750> into

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
pipe cleaners dipped that I've cut into

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.990 
pipe cleaners dipped that I've cut into
fours<00:03:51.430> and<00:03:52.329> then<00:03:53.200> okay<00:03:53.950> another<00:03:54.400> one<00:03:54.670> for

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
fours and then okay another one for

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.660 
fours and then okay another one for
example<00:03:55.150> we'll<00:03:55.930> use<00:03:55.959> little<00:03:56.470> triangles<00:03:57.220> I

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
example we'll use little triangles I

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.509 
example we'll use little triangles I
don't<00:03:58.420> use<00:03:58.569> all<00:03:58.750> these<00:03:58.959> objects<00:03:59.379> but<00:03:59.590> it's

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
don't use all these objects but it's

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.699 
don't use all these objects but it's
just<00:04:00.760> variety<00:04:01.269> sometimes<00:04:01.750> I<00:04:01.870> use<00:04:02.049> one<00:04:02.439> and

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
just variety sometimes I use one and

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.160 
just variety sometimes I use one and
another<00:04:03.189> day<00:04:03.400> I<00:04:03.430> use<00:04:03.700> another<00:04:03.939> one<00:04:04.180> okay<00:04:05.019> we

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
another day I use another one okay we

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.500 
another day I use another one okay we
have<00:04:05.319> little<00:04:05.590> triangles<00:04:06.220> and<00:04:06.970> we're<00:04:07.180> putting

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
have little triangles and we're putting

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:13.439 
have little triangles and we're putting
them<00:04:07.629> like<00:04:07.870> this<00:04:11.250> learn<00:04:12.250> your<00:04:12.430> shape<00:04:12.819> you<00:04:13.209> can

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:13.449 
them like this learn your shape you can

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:16.020 
them like this learn your shape you can
burn<00:04:13.599> your<00:04:13.980> colors<00:04:14.980> while<00:04:15.340> you're<00:04:15.549> doing<00:04:15.910> it

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
burn your colors while you're doing it

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.400 
burn your colors while you're doing it
while<00:04:16.239> you're<00:04:16.419> preparing<00:04:16.810> the<00:04:16.959> board<00:04:17.169> and

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
while you're preparing the board and

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.620 
while you're preparing the board and
talking<00:04:17.769> to<00:04:17.889> your<00:04:18.010> child<00:04:18.269> let's<00:04:19.269> start<00:04:19.510> with

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
talking to your child let's start with

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.080 
talking to your child let's start with
just<00:04:19.780> a<00:04:19.959> few<00:04:20.199> like<00:04:20.500> for<00:04:20.889> example<00:04:21.370> I<00:04:21.910> put

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
just a few like for example I put

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.920 
just a few like for example I put
together<00:04:22.210> is<00:04:22.419> a<00:04:22.479> back<00:04:22.800> and<00:04:24.090> she<00:04:25.090> has<00:04:25.449> to<00:04:25.659> take

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
together is a back and she has to take

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:34.070 
together is a back and she has to take
it<00:04:26.110> and<00:04:27.180> turn<00:04:28.180> it<00:04:28.479> upside<00:04:29.470> down<00:04:31.889> upside<00:04:32.889> add

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
it and turn it upside down upside add

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.300 
it and turn it upside down upside add
triangle<00:04:35.080> is<00:04:35.139> not<00:04:35.260> really<00:04:35.710> the<00:04:35.830> best<00:04:35.949> one<00:04:36.190> for

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
triangle is not really the best one for

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.029 
triangle is not really the best one for
this<00:04:36.430> because<00:04:36.849> it's<00:04:37.060> got<00:04:37.740> points<00:04:38.740> on<00:04:38.860> each

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
this because it's got points on each

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:43.680 
this because it's got points on each
side<00:04:40.560> three<00:04:41.560> different<00:04:42.010> points<00:04:42.330> but<00:04:43.330> it's

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
side three different points but it's

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.360 
side three different points but it's
good<00:04:43.900> enough<00:04:44.110> even<00:04:44.440> just<00:04:44.650> to<00:04:44.770> turn<00:04:45.760> it<00:04:45.909> once

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
good enough even just to turn it once

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.310 
good enough even just to turn it once
this<00:04:48.370> is<00:04:48.550> again<00:04:48.849> good<00:04:49.090> for<00:04:49.270> her<00:04:49.419> little<00:04:49.570> motor

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
this is again good for her little motor

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.779 
this is again good for her little motor
skills<00:04:50.800> and<00:04:51.300> her<00:04:52.300> little<00:04:52.479> fingers<00:04:53.550> maybe<00:04:54.550> an

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:54.789 
skills and her little fingers maybe an

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:57.659 
skills and her little fingers maybe an
easier<00:04:55.180> shape<00:04:55.510> would<00:04:55.720> be<00:04:55.780> the<00:04:56.020> heart<00:04:56.639> we<00:04:57.639> have

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
easier shape would be the heart we have

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.830 
easier shape would be the heart we have
them<00:04:58.030> right<00:04:58.240> side<00:04:58.539> up

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.620 

put<00:05:02.350> this<00:05:02.470> on<00:05:02.680> her<00:05:02.800> board<00:05:03.220> and<00:05:03.610> she<00:05:04.240> has<00:05:04.420> to

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
put this on her board and she has to

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:12.440 
put this on her board and she has to
turn<00:05:04.960> it<00:05:05.139> upside<00:05:06.450> down<00:05:07.620> upside<00:05:09.900> down<00:05:11.190> upside

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
turn it upside down upside down upside

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.650 
turn it upside down upside down upside
down<00:05:13.950> or<00:05:14.950> I<00:05:15.010> may<00:05:15.400> have<00:05:15.430> them<00:05:15.790> all<00:05:16.000> prepared<00:05:16.450> and

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
down or I may have them all prepared and

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.360 
down or I may have them all prepared and
lined<00:05:16.840> up<00:05:17.020> upside<00:05:17.350> down<00:05:17.530> and<00:05:17.770> she<00:05:17.919> has<00:05:18.070> to<00:05:18.220> turn

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
lined up upside down and she has to turn

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.940 
lined up upside down and she has to turn
them<00:05:18.639> right<00:05:19.120> side<00:05:19.180> up<00:05:19.480> so<00:05:19.930> you're<00:05:20.740> teaching

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950 
them right side up so you're teaching

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
me three circles so she finds the

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:39.000 
me three circles so she finds the
circles<00:05:34.300> one<00:05:36.570> she<00:05:37.570> gets<00:05:37.750> three<00:05:38.200> circles<00:05:38.770> from

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010 
circles one she gets three circles from

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:46.170 
circles one she gets three circles from
our<00:05:39.190> box<00:05:39.630> container<00:05:40.680> one<00:05:41.680> two<00:05:43.530> three<00:05:44.820> okay<00:05:45.820> we

our box container one two three okay we

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.909 
our box container one two three okay we
have<00:05:46.330> just<00:05:46.570> one<00:05:46.900> thing<00:05:47.200> going<00:05:47.500> at<00:05:47.590> a<00:05:47.620> time

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
have just one thing going at a time

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:50.520 
have just one thing going at a time
otherwise<00:05:48.130> it's<00:05:48.550> a<00:05:48.610> little<00:05:48.850> bit<00:05:49.000> too<00:05:49.150> much<00:05:49.530> and

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530 
otherwise it's a little bit too much and

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:52.590 
otherwise it's a little bit too much and
it<00:05:50.650> gets<00:05:50.830> confusing<00:05:51.430> so<00:05:51.970> make<00:05:52.150> sure<00:05:52.180> that<00:05:52.360> you

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
it gets confusing so make sure that you

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.280 
it gets confusing so make sure that you
stick<00:05:52.840> with<00:05:52.960> one<00:05:53.169> thing<00:05:53.200> on<00:05:53.500> your<00:05:53.650> board<00:05:54.060> three
