they<00:03:16.820> don't<00:03:17.000> know<00:03:17.120> about<00:03:17.300> that<00:03:19.870> yeah<00:03:20.930> I<00:03:21.080> joined

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.979 
they don't know about that yeah I joined
army<00:03:21.769> when<00:03:22.459> I<00:03:22.489> was<00:03:22.760> seventeen<00:03:23.269> and<00:03:23.420> that<00:03:23.840> was

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
army when I was seventeen and that was

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.310 
army when I was seventeen and that was
in<00:03:24.140> 1980<00:03:24.890> and<00:03:25.250> my<00:03:26.150> resonable<00:03:26.600> regimen<00:03:27.140> was

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
in 1980 and my resonable regimen was

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.290 
in 1980 and my resonable regimen was
sixth<00:03:28.100> Gurkha<00:03:29.090> Rifles<00:03:29.440> with<00:03:31.150> stationed<00:03:32.150> in

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
sixth Gurkha Rifles with stationed in

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.449 
sixth Gurkha Rifles with stationed in
new<00:03:33.140> territory<00:03:33.350> in<00:03:33.739> Hong<00:03:34.040> Kong

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
new territory in Hong Kong

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:40.690 
new territory in Hong Kong
I<00:03:37.120> think<00:03:38.500> the<00:03:39.500> Gurkhas<00:03:39.890> in<00:03:40.190> Hong<00:03:40.400> Kong<00:03:40.430> and

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
I think the Gurkhas in Hong Kong and

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.430 
I think the Gurkhas in Hong Kong and
thus<00:03:40.850> aside<00:03:41.269> the<00:03:41.480> Hong<00:03:41.600> Kong<00:03:41.630> society<00:03:42.230> is

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
thus aside the Hong Kong society is

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.330 
thus aside the Hong Kong society is
quite<00:03:43.750> respectful<00:03:44.750> to<00:03:45.530> the<00:03:45.650> workers<00:03:46.010> because

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
quite respectful to the workers because

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:52.509 
quite respectful to the workers because
of<00:03:46.370> the<00:03:46.670> long<00:03:46.880> history<00:03:48.370> most<00:03:49.370> of<00:03:49.610> the<00:03:51.519> benefits

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
of the long history most of the benefits

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.850 
of the long history most of the benefits
or<00:03:52.940> the<00:03:52.970> the<00:03:53.420> volunteer<00:03:53.900> courses<00:03:54.410> whatever

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
or the the volunteer courses whatever

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.470 
or the the volunteer courses whatever
the<00:03:55.040> government<00:03:55.310> of<00:03:55.549> Hong<00:03:55.700> Kong<00:03:55.880> is<00:03:56.000> doing<00:03:56.329> is

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
the government of Hong Kong is doing is

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.660 
the government of Hong Kong is doing is
mostly<00:03:57.290> only<00:03:57.530> in<00:03:57.739> English<00:03:58.100> sorry<00:03:58.489> in

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
mostly only in English sorry in

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.289 
mostly only in English sorry in
Cantonese<00:03:59.120> so<00:03:59.810> if<00:04:00.110> you<00:04:00.230> cannot<00:04:00.500> read<00:04:01.299> Chinese

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
Cantonese so if you cannot read Chinese

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.440 
Cantonese so if you cannot read Chinese
you<00:04:02.989> almost<00:04:03.610> out<00:04:04.610> of<00:04:04.670> it<00:04:04.970> you<00:04:05.120> don't<00:04:05.329> know

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
you almost out of it you don't know

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.699 
you almost out of it you don't know
nothing<00:04:06.230> about<00:04:06.350> it

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
nothing about it

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.550 
nothing about it
so<00:04:06.950> I<00:04:07.220> think<00:04:07.850> the<00:04:08.120> most<00:04:08.780> important<00:04:09.260> thing<00:04:09.380> is

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
so I think the most important thing is

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.170 
so I think the most important thing is
you<00:04:09.709> have<00:04:09.769> to<00:04:10.040> learn<00:04:10.670> Cantonese<00:04:11.450> otherwise<00:04:11.900> it

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
you have to learn Cantonese otherwise it

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.870 
you have to learn Cantonese otherwise it
will<00:04:14.180> be<00:04:14.329> quite<00:04:14.540> difficult

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.290 

I<00:04:17.910> was<00:04:18.810> born<00:04:19.170> in<00:04:19.320> Hong<00:04:19.500> Kong<00:04:19.530> and<00:04:20.070> I'm<00:04:21.030> here

studying in secondary school in front

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:37.250 
studying in secondary school in front
for<00:04:34.310> in<00:04:35.310> one<00:04:35.730> point<00:04:36.030> the<00:04:36.420> language<00:04:36.810> barrier

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
for in one point the language barrier

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.770 
for in one point the language barrier
the<00:04:37.740> language<00:04:38.040> was<00:04:38.130> also<00:04:38.310> the<00:04:38.610> problem<00:04:38.850> but

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
the language was also the problem but

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.240 
the language was also the problem but
it's<00:04:39.960> not<00:04:40.170> only<00:04:40.320> based<00:04:40.650> on<00:04:40.860> that<00:04:41.010> there<00:04:41.190> are

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
it's not only based on that there are

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.270 
it's not only based on that there are
many<00:04:41.430> problems<00:04:41.820> in<00:04:42.300> Hong<00:04:42.540> Kong<00:04:42.660> you<00:04:42.990> know<00:04:43.280> they

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
many problems in Hong Kong you know they

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.640 
many problems in Hong Kong you know they
I<00:04:44.550> think<00:04:44.850> I<00:04:44.940> feel<00:04:45.180> that<00:04:45.450> they<00:04:46.050> are<00:04:46.080> thinking

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
I think I feel that they are thinking

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.620 
I think I feel that they are thinking
that<00:04:46.830> we're<00:04:47.520> kind<00:04:48.330> of<00:04:49.730> disadvantaged<00:04:50.730> and<00:04:51.180> we

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
that we're kind of disadvantaged and we

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.070 
that we're kind of disadvantaged and we
just<00:04:51.840> came<00:04:52.050> here<00:04:52.880> because<00:04:53.880> our<00:04:54.330> parents<00:04:54.660> are

just came here because our parents are

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.420 
just came here because our parents are
just<00:04:55.830> to<00:04:55.980> earn<00:04:56.160> money<00:04:56.520> but<00:04:57.330> not<00:04:57.570> to<00:04:58.430> do

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
just to earn money but not to do

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.610 
just to earn money but not to do
something<00:05:00.000> over<00:05:00.270> here<00:05:00.660> I<00:05:00.720> mean<00:05:00.960> I<00:05:00.990> feel<00:05:01.290> like<00:05:01.530> I

understand why they stereotyped us you

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.720 
understand why they stereotyped us you
know<00:05:09.300> thinking<00:05:10.290> that<00:05:10.470> we're<00:05:10.710> not<00:05:10.890> capable<00:05:11.250> of

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:11.730 
know thinking that we're not capable of

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.660 
know thinking that we're not capable of
doing<00:05:12.060> anything<00:05:12.330> and<00:05:12.630> also<00:05:13.350> the<00:05:13.650> main<00:05:13.830> problem

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 
doing anything and also the main problem

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.300 
doing anything and also the main problem
over<00:05:14.910> here<00:05:15.120> is<00:05:15.240> that<00:05:15.420> in<00:05:15.570> Hong<00:05:15.720> Kong<00:05:16.310> there's

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
over here is that in Hong Kong there's

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.820 
over here is that in Hong Kong there's
there's<00:05:17.970> so<00:05:18.210> much<00:05:18.360> limitation<00:05:19.200> to<00:05:19.350> resources

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
there's so much limitation to resources

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.250 
there's so much limitation to resources
in<00:05:20.070> education<00:05:20.190> and<00:05:20.940> I<00:05:21.360> don't<00:05:21.570> like<00:05:21.750> that<00:05:21.960> way

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
in education and I don't like that way

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.360 
in education and I don't like that way
because<00:05:22.590> in<00:05:22.860> that<00:05:23.010> way<00:05:23.070> we<00:05:23.630> answers<00:05:24.630> can't

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
because in that way we answers can't

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.520 
because in that way we answers can't
generate<00:05:26.370> the<00:05:26.580> knowledge<00:05:26.970> within<00:05:27.450> us<00:05:27.720> were
