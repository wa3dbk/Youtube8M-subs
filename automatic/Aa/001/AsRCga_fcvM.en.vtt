00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.070
 O 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.530
 op to butter she has to be in 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:55.379
 room temperature is easier 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:59.670
 work in a pot all around 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:02.870
 butters that are in pots plots 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.870
 small in 200 grams 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.290
 We put all the condensed milk 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.040
 I always put it in a box for who it is 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.700
 much more than the tin 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:33.110
 of cans is already five reais and if 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.110
 I paid 2 80 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.620
 Let's mix these two first. 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.620
 Ingredients 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.350
 and now we are going to add corn starch 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.180
 gradually it is until it becomes a 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.470
 Good consistency for kneading with your hands 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:15.190
 meanwhile I'm going to use the spoon 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:19.290
 to make lots of corn starch mess 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.290
 also the box all the action 500 grams 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.020
 trying to mess with a lot of violence 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.730
 because the corn starch it goes like this 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.280
 very easily I 'm not going very much 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:24.150
 thin 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.720
 so you can play and then make a 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.310
 mess is very easy then whoever tries 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.560
 stir calmly 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:38.209
 O king of the band but this 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.209
 Happens but the quieter the better. 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:49.680
 It's almost on the right spot, you see. 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.730
 O still okay the tooth but still 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.730
 be afraid of me here 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:52.620
 look open the dough with the same hand 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:56.240
 and I passed the pasta roll just to give 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.240
 a more practical lisinha 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:05.759
 then you can model with the hand to make goal 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:10.159
 I'm making all the men know that 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:16.129
 cover in a way I'm putting 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:16.129
 context oven is already connected 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:38.969
 while the degree did a bit here still 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:43.169
 about enough mass, I 'll go 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:45.240
 How are you looking at the polka dots? 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:46.979
 will still remain and we grinder 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.930
 then I mix everything up again by doing the 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:50.460
 same procedure by stretching the mass 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:54.659
 removing the balls until the 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:58.589
 mass ratio was this way or the 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:06:03.839
 mass as it gets very easy to work 

00:05:58.589 --> 00:06:07.979
 It's just you, it's okay, she looks ball 

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:13.259
 You can also make 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:15.270
 cropped O but I wanted to make seat 

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:18.710
 of the standard medium knows the same size per 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.710
 This is what I did with the neighboring template. 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.509
 well I'll put it here now in the chair and 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:28.219
 put the crop make a point of showing 

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:28.219
 for you the first roast shipment 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:35.759
 op is actually so in the recipe 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:38.219
 I think it would be even more practical 

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:41.339
 put butter paper on the bottom of the form 

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:43.279
 but I do not have butter paper so I 

00:06:41.339 --> 00:06:45.810
 I counted the shape with a little margarine 

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:50.650
 and a little bit of corn starch that I 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:54.940
 I was here and so was okay now I 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:07:00.509
 playing here the cookies try to use 

00:06:54.940 --> 00:07:05.699
 the maximum space to fit enough 

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:05.699
 do not need to stay so many times in the oven 

00:07:29.229 --> 00:07:34.020
 so now I'm going to take it to the oven at 150 

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.020
 degrees
