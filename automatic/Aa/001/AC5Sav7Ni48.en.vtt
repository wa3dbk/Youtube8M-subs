where<00:00:01.800> did<00:00:01.920> I<00:00:02.040> get<00:00:02.100> six<00:00:02.700> where<00:00:02.970> did<00:00:03.179> I<00:00:03.300> get<00:00:03.360> six

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
where did I get six where did I get six

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:17.510 
where did I get six where did I get six
here<00:00:04.640> pf6<00:00:11.750> did<00:00:12.750> I<00:00:12.870> get<00:00:13.080> six<00:00:15.470> or<00:00:16.490> should<00:00:17.490> be

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
here pf6 did I get six or should be

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.060 
here pf6 did I get six or should be
seven<00:00:18.000> why<00:00:18.390> did<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:18.600> get<00:00:18.690> 600<00:00:21.680> well<00:00:22.680> it's<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.949> good

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
seven why did I get 600 well it's a good

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.150 
seven why did I get 600 well it's a good
example<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.730> this<00:00:23.789> now<00:00:24.289> this<00:00:25.289> two<00:00:25.710> times<00:00:25.890> three

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
example of this now this two times three

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.380 
example of this now this two times three
was<00:00:26.340> six<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:27.050> then<00:00:28.050> five<00:00:28.890> plus<00:00:29.550> two<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:30.210> should

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
was six and then five plus two it should

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.450 
was six and then five plus two it should
have<00:00:30.480> been<00:00:30.539> seven<00:00:30.929> right<00:00:31.260> so<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:31.769> confuse<00:00:32.279> it

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
have been seven right so I confuse it

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.520 
have been seven right so I confuse it
with<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.850> six<00:00:33.210> so<00:00:33.960> this<00:00:34.110> one<00:00:34.320> should<00:00:34.350> be

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
with that six so this one should be

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.330 
with that six so this one should be
seven<00:00:36.110> this<00:00:37.110> one<00:00:37.410> should<00:00:37.680> be<00:00:37.739> 70<00:00:39.980> that<00:00:40.980> doesn't

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
seven this one should be 70 that doesn't

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.400 
seven this one should be 70 that doesn't
change<00:00:41.370> our<00:00:41.670> answer<00:00:42.149> does<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:42.960> change<00:00:43.020> our

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
change our answer does that change our

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.580 
change our answer does that change our
answer<00:00:44.329> it<00:00:45.329> doesn't<00:00:45.690> change<00:00:45.719> our<00:00:46.020> answer<00:00:46.350> for

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
answer it doesn't change our answer for

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.330 
answer it doesn't change our answer for
the<00:00:46.739> angle<00:00:47.070> huh<00:00:48.230> so<00:00:49.230> because<00:00:49.649> when<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.070> divide

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
the angle huh so because when you divide

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.119 
the angle huh so because when you divide
it<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.760> got<00:00:50.940> rid<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.420> seven<00:00:51.930> anyway<00:00:52.289> so<00:00:53.010> it

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
it you got rid of the seven anyway so it

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:04.479 
it you got rid of the seven anyway so it
does<00:00:53.610> change<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.120> here<00:00:54.420> though

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.429 

so<00:01:05.150> over<00:01:05.360> here<00:01:05.390> it<00:01:05.630> changes<00:01:06.049> it<00:01:08.320> what<00:01:09.320> does

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
so over here it changes it what does

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:26.000 
so over here it changes it what does
that<00:01:09.560> give<00:01:09.799> you<00:01:09.920> here

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:38.130 

one<00:01:26.460> point<00:01:26.700> or<00:01:26.940> six<00:01:27.360> seven

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.090 

right<00:01:40.539> so<00:01:41.539> they<00:01:41.810> kind<00:01:42.320> of<00:01:42.409> slow<00:01:42.710> each<00:01:42.890> other

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
right so they kind of slow each other

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.999 
right so they kind of slow each other
down<00:01:43.990> one<00:01:44.990> is<00:01:45.140> moving<00:01:45.320> at<00:01:45.590> three<00:01:45.829> the<00:01:45.920> other

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
down one is moving at three the other

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.550 
down one is moving at three the other
one<00:01:46.219> is<00:01:46.250> moving<00:01:46.670> at<00:01:46.789> two<00:01:47.090> but<00:01:47.899> they<00:01:48.140> kind<00:01:48.439> of

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
one is moving at two but they kind of

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.980 
one is moving at two but they kind of
cancel<00:01:49.039> each<00:01:49.189> other<00:01:49.399> right<00:01:50.119> their<00:01:50.360> velocities

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
cancel each other right their velocities

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.929 
cancel each other right their velocities
so<00:01:51.740> now<00:01:51.920> what's<00:01:52.159> the<00:01:52.250> percent<00:01:52.640> loss<00:01:52.759> of

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
so now what's the percent loss of

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:54.789 
so now what's the percent loss of
kinetic<00:01:53.299> energy<00:01:53.569> since<00:01:53.780> this<00:01:53.960> is<00:01:54.140> inelastic

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
kinetic energy since this is inelastic

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.069 
kinetic energy since this is inelastic
collision<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:55.909> kinetic<00:01:56.479> energy<00:01:56.569> is<00:01:56.869> going<00:01:57.020> to

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
collision the kinetic energy is going to

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:00.760 
collision the kinetic energy is going to
be<00:01:57.229> lost<00:01:57.640> okay<00:01:58.640> so<00:01:58.700> let's<00:01:59.329> go<00:01:59.509> over<00:01:59.689> here<00:01:59.929> the

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
be lost okay so let's go over here the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.959 
be lost okay so let's go over here the
kinetic<00:02:01.189> energy<00:02:01.310> initial<00:02:02.469> is<00:02:04.569> one-half<00:02:05.569> x<00:02:06.100> 2<00:02:07.100> x

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:07.969 
kinetic energy initial is one-half x 2 x

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:14.380 
kinetic energy initial is one-half x 2 x
3<00:02:08.239> squared<00:02:08.899> plus<00:02:09.739> one-half<00:02:10.340> times<00:02:11.019> 5<00:02:12.019> times<00:02:13.390> 2

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
3 squared plus one-half times 5 times 2

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.380 
3 squared plus one-half times 5 times 2
squared<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:16.190> mass<00:02:16.400> here<00:02:16.670> is<00:02:16.790> five<00:02:17.000> and<00:02:17.030> then

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
squared the mass here is five and then

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.050 
squared the mass here is five and then
vast<00:02:17.660> is<00:02:17.930> to<00:02:18.170> now<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.040> one<00:02:19.280> thing<00:02:19.670> that<00:02:19.730> this

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
vast is to now the one thing that this

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.420 
vast is to now the one thing that this
will<00:02:20.299> show<00:02:20.959> you<00:02:21.019> here<00:02:21.470> is<00:02:21.500> that<00:02:21.950> when<00:02:22.190> we're

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
will show you here is that when we're

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.339 
will show you here is that when we're
doing<00:02:22.579> kinetic<00:02:23.150> energy<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.780> angle<00:02:24.140> doesn't

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
doing kinetic energy the angle doesn't

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.910 
doing kinetic energy the angle doesn't
matter<00:02:25.510> kinetic<00:02:26.510> energy<00:02:26.599> is<00:02:26.900> a<00:02:27.019> scalar<00:02:27.380> all<00:02:27.739> it

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
matter kinetic energy is a scalar all it

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.699 
matter kinetic energy is a scalar all it
matters<00:02:28.099> is<00:02:28.459> under<00:02:28.730> how<00:02:29.360> fast<00:02:29.720> it's<00:02:29.959> going<00:02:30.049> you

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
matters is under how fast it's going you

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.300 
matters is under how fast it's going you
square<00:02:31.130> that<00:02:31.160> and<00:02:31.610> then<00:02:31.700> times<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.150> mass

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
square that and then times the mass

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.830 
square that and then times the mass
divided<00:02:34.310> by<00:02:34.340> two<00:02:34.599> so<00:02:35.599> this<00:02:35.750> one<00:02:35.989> gives<00:02:36.260> you<00:02:36.500> 9<00:02:37.099> +

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
divided by two so this one gives you 9 +

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.849 
divided by two so this one gives you 9 +
10<00:02:39.069> 19<00:02:40.069> joules<00:02:40.340> and<00:02:41.170> then<00:02:42.170> the<00:02:42.290> final<00:02:42.319> kinetic

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:42.859 
10 19 joules and then the final kinetic

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:45.809 
10 19 joules and then the final kinetic
energy<00:02:43.340> also<00:02:43.970> doesn't<00:02:44.329> matter<00:02:44.959> on<00:02:45.290> the

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
energy also doesn't matter on the

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.629 
energy also doesn't matter on the
direction<00:02:46.959> so<00:02:47.959> half<00:02:48.230> times<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.980> total<00:02:49.250> mass

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:49.639 
direction so half times the total mass

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:53.920 
direction so half times the total mass
is<00:02:49.880> seven<00:02:51.790> right<00:02:52.790> time<00:02:53.389> is<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.569> final

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
is seven right time is the final

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:02.110 
is seven right time is the final
velocity<00:02:53.989> squared<00:03:00.730> that's<00:03:01.730> going<00:03:02.000> to<00:03:02.060> be

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
velocity squared that's going to be

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.759 
velocity squared that's going to be
pretty<00:03:02.269> small<00:03:02.540> there<00:03:03.760> compared<00:03:04.760> to<00:03:04.819> the

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
pretty small there compared to the

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:13.559 
pretty small there compared to the
initial<00:03:06.769> kinetic<00:03:07.459> energy

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:21.390 

3.9<00:03:14.439> 88<00:03:15.069> 3.99<00:03:16.060> huh<00:03:19.349> so<00:03:20.349> since<00:03:20.680> this<00:03:20.829> is<00:03:21.040> kind<00:03:21.310> of

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
3.9 88 3.99 huh so since this is kind of

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.879 
3.9 88 3.99 huh so since this is kind of
like<00:03:21.609> a<00:03:21.670> head-on<00:03:21.969> collision<00:03:22.389> that<00:03:23.349> kinetic

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:23.889 
like a head-on collision that kinetic

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:42.690 
like a head-on collision that kinetic
energy<00:03:24.249> is<00:03:24.310> lost<00:03:24.549> quite<00:03:25.650> quite<00:03:26.650> a<00:03:26.769> lot<00:03:41.700> 19

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
energy is lost quite quite a lot 19

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:49.470 
energy is lost quite quite a lot 19
minus<00:03:43.239> 3.9<00:03:44.109> 9<00:03:44.760> /<00:03:45.760> 19<00:03:46.569> times<00:03:47.879> 179<00:03:48.879> percent<00:03:49.299> loss

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
minus 3.9 9 / 19 times 179 percent loss

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.199 
minus 3.9 9 / 19 times 179 percent loss
of<00:03:49.750> kinetic<00:03:50.139> energy<00:03:50.530> okay<00:03:53.909> so<00:03:54.909> that's<00:03:55.090> a

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
of kinetic energy okay so that's a

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:01.289 
of kinetic energy okay so that's a
big-time<00:03:55.389> accident<00:03:56.370> okay<00:03:59.430> so<00:04:00.430> if<00:04:00.790> these<00:04:01.090> were

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
big-time accident okay so if these were

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:02.459 
big-time accident okay so if these were
cars<00:04:01.569> the<00:04:01.810> same<00:04:02.019> thing<00:04:02.199> would<00:04:02.290> be<00:04:02.349> true

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:02.469 
cars the same thing would be true

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:05.339 
cars the same thing would be true
seventy-nine<00:04:03.400> percent<00:04:03.519> would<00:04:03.849> be<00:04:04.000> lost<00:04:04.349> okay

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:05.349 
seventy-nine percent would be lost okay

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:10.830 
seventy-nine percent would be lost okay
so<00:04:06.120> now<00:04:07.120> let's<00:04:07.480> make<00:04:08.379> this<00:04:09.510> change<00:04:10.510> it<00:04:10.719> around

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
so now let's make this change it around

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.289 
so now let's make this change it around
a<00:04:11.230> little<00:04:11.260> bit<00:04:13.290> make<00:04:14.290> it<00:04:14.319> a<00:04:14.669> totally<00:04:15.669> elastic

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
a little bit make it a totally elastic

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.870 
a little bit make it a totally elastic
collision
