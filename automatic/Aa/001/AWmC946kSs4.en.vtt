00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
much last season but of course united

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.869 
much last season but of course united
were<00:00:58.289> struggling<00:00:58.890> with<00:00:59.190> David<00:00:59.699> Moyes's

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
manager the team weren't performing as a

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.889 
manager the team weren't performing as a
whole<00:01:01.710> not<00:01:01.949> just<00:01:02.149> yeah<00:01:03.149> knows<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.480> as<00:01:03.719> an

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
whole not just yeah knows I as an

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.109 
whole not just yeah knows I as an
individual<00:01:04.409> so<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.309> still<00:01:05.489> think<00:01:05.700> he's<00:01:05.880> got<00:01:06.030> the

individual so I still think he's got the

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.550 
individual so I still think he's got the
potential<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.570> become<00:01:06.750> one<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.380> better

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
midfield sent a midcard and I think

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.090 
midfield sent a midcard and I think

to<00:02:06.240> become<00:02:06.570> one<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.290> better<00:02:07.500> midfielders

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
to become one of the better midfielders

he and and Josh McEachran are probably

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.539 
he and and Josh McEachran are probably
the<00:03:25.080> two<00:03:25.110> best<00:03:25.470> essentially<00:03:26.100> field<00:03:26.310> as<00:03:26.430> we

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
the two best essentially field as we

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.220 
the two best essentially field as we
have<00:03:26.730> in<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.450> lineup<00:03:27.810> although<00:03:28.080> of<00:03:28.200> course

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
have in the lineup although of course

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.780 
have in the lineup although of course
you've<00:03:28.890> got<00:03:28.920> players<00:03:29.190> like<00:03:29.400> Lewis<00:03:29.580> Baker

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
you've got players like Lewis Baker

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.070 
you've got players like Lewis Baker
coming<00:03:30.090> through<00:03:30.360> as<00:03:30.510> well<00:03:30.720> that<00:03:30.930> can

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
coming through as well that can

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.780 
coming through as well that can
potentially<00:03:31.200> break<00:03:32.010> into<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.400> first<00:03:32.640> team

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
potentially break into the first team

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.520 
potentially break into the first team
over<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.180> next<00:03:33.450> few<00:03:33.690> years<00:03:33.750> we'll<00:03:34.140> have<00:03:34.170> to

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
over the next few years we'll have to

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.530 
over the next few years we'll have to
wait<00:03:34.650> and<00:03:34.709> see<00:03:34.890> how<00:03:35.459> that<00:03:35.730> goes<00:03:35.760> but<00:03:36.209> I<00:03:36.269> think

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
wait and see how that goes but I think

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.180 
wait and see how that goes but I think
tell<00:03:36.720> about<00:03:36.930> will<00:03:37.140> hopefully<00:03:37.620> get<00:03:38.130> some

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
tell about will hopefully get some

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.009 
tell about will hopefully get some
decent<00:03:38.489> first-team<00:03:39.090> football<00:03:39.120> at<00:03:39.570> Burnley

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
decent first-team football at Burnley

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.050 
decent first-team football at Burnley
hasn't<00:03:40.380> played<00:03:40.590> as<00:03:40.860> of<00:03:41.070> yet<00:03:41.310> to<00:03:41.489> my<00:03:42.030> knowledge

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
hasn't played as of yet to my knowledge

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.210 
hasn't played as of yet to my knowledge
although<00:03:42.630> I<00:03:42.690> may<00:03:43.019> be<00:03:43.080> wrong<00:03:43.410> there<00:03:43.680> he<00:03:44.070> may

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
although I may be wrong there he may

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.090 
although I may be wrong there he may
have<00:03:44.250> had<00:03:44.489> some<00:03:44.760> football<00:03:45.150> already<00:03:45.570> but<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:46.380> I

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
have had some football already but the I

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.949 
have had some football already but the I
guess<00:03:47.400> we<00:03:47.519> wait<00:03:47.640> and<00:03:47.700> see<00:03:47.940> how<00:03:48.239> well<00:03:48.480> he<00:03:48.750> plays

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
guess we wait and see how well he plays

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.930 
guess we wait and see how well he plays
this<00:03:49.230> season<00:03:49.290> but<00:03:49.620> I<00:03:49.680> think<00:03:49.860> growing<00:03:50.130> why's<00:03:50.459> he

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
this season but I think growing why's he

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.940 
this season but I think growing why's he
could<00:03:51.150> be<00:03:51.269> a<00:03:51.299> good<00:03:51.660> young<00:03:52.140> player<00:03:52.170> to<00:03:52.620> pick<00:03:52.769> up

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
could be a good young player to pick up

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.860 
could be a good young player to pick up
