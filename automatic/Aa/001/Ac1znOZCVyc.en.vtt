00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
pink but this is what the foundation

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.580 
pink but this is what the foundation
that<00:01:15.509> looks<00:01:15.840> like<00:01:16.020> it's<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.290> pretty<00:01:16.470> small

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
that looks like it's a pretty small

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.740 
that looks like it's a pretty small
bottle<00:01:17.340> it's<00:01:17.490> not<00:01:17.670> even<00:01:17.970> one<00:01:18.240> fluid<00:01:18.509> ounce

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
bottle it's not even one fluid ounce

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.570 
bottle it's not even one fluid ounce
which<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.530> kind<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.920> lame<00:01:20.130> because<00:01:20.310> you're

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
which is kind of lame because you're

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.310 
which is kind of lame because you're
playing<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:21.030> think<00:01:21.119> this<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.479> like<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.689> $32

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.570 
playing I think this is like a $32
foundation<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.509> it's<00:01:24.509> small<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:26.400> cool

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
foundation and it's small so the cool

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.710 
foundation and it's small so the cool
thing<00:01:26.729> about<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:27.060> though<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.479> they<00:01:27.570> say

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
thing about this though is that they say

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.300 
thing about this though is that they say
you<00:01:27.780> can<00:01:27.960> use<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.170> as<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.530> foundation<00:01:29.159> or

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
you can use it as a foundation or

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.670 
you can use it as a foundation or

a<00:03:45.380> primer<00:03:45.680> to<00:03:46.099> my<00:03:46.639> nose<00:03:46.819> so<00:03:47.060> we'll<00:03:47.150> kind<00:03:47.359> of<00:03:47.389> see

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
a primer to my nose so we'll kind of see

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.740

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.000 
with two layers on of the nourishing
foundation<00:03:56.900> I<00:03:57.109> really<00:03:57.410> like<00:03:57.620> the<00:03:57.859> way<00:03:57.980> it

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010

looks
um<00:03:59.260> the<00:04:00.260> coverage<00:04:00.680> is<00:04:00.829> really<00:04:01.160> good<00:04:01.310> I<00:04:01.340> would

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
um the coverage is really good I would

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:03.280 
um the coverage is really good I would
say<00:04:01.730> it<00:04:01.790> is<00:04:01.910> true<00:04:02.269> to<00:04:02.419> a<00:04:02.450> medium<00:04:02.930> to<00:04:03.079> full

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
say it is true to a medium to full

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.800 
say it is true to a medium to full
coverage<00:04:03.319> super<00:04:04.010> buildable<00:04:04.340> I<00:04:04.700> feel<00:04:05.630> like<00:04:05.720> you

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
coverage super buildable I feel like you

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.270 
coverage super buildable I feel like you
can<00:04:05.989> build<00:04:06.200> a<00:04:06.349> lot<00:04:06.530> on<00:04:06.650> this<00:04:06.829> and<00:04:06.980> it<00:04:07.069> wouldn't

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
can build a lot on this and it wouldn't

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.720 
can build a lot on this and it wouldn't
look<00:04:07.370> too<00:04:07.579> cakey<00:04:07.880> like<00:04:08.299> after<00:04:08.569> you

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
so the powder anything it was pretty

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.680 
so the powder anything it was pretty
lightweight<00:04:11.069> on<00:04:11.489> the<00:04:11.519> face<00:04:11.849> as<00:04:12.090> well<00:04:12.390> I'm

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
lightweight on the face as well I'm

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.449 
lightweight on the face as well I'm
going<00:04:12.989> to<00:04:13.170> powder<00:04:13.470> it<00:04:13.680> and<00:04:13.980> everything<00:04:14.340> like

going to powder it and everything like

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.159 
going to powder it and everything like
that<00:04:14.519> so<00:04:14.700> we'll<00:04:14.970> see<00:04:15.150> how<00:04:15.299> long<00:04:15.480> this<00:04:15.690> wear<00:04:16.019> is

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
that so we'll see how long this wear is

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.650 
that so we'll see how long this wear is
for<00:04:16.440> as<00:04:16.590> well<00:04:16.889> it<00:04:17.190> says<00:04:17.760> on<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.030> website<00:04:18.150> you

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
for as well it says on the website you

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.449 
for as well it says on the website you
can<00:04:18.840> wear<00:04:18.989> it<00:04:19.079> up<00:04:19.139> to<00:04:19.229> like<00:04:19.320> 24<00:04:19.829> hours<00:04:20.250> or

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
can wear it up to like 24 hours or

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:21.620 
can wear it up to like 24 hours or
something<00:04:20.639> and<00:04:20.910> it's<00:04:21.000> supposed<00:04:21.180> to<00:04:21.209> be<00:04:21.329> super

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
something and it's supposed to be super

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.960 
something and it's supposed to be super
long<00:04:21.810> wearing<00:04:22.350> waterproof<00:04:23.100> doesn't<00:04:23.729> smudge

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
long wearing waterproof doesn't smudge

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.050 
long wearing waterproof doesn't smudge
doesn't<00:04:24.479> transfer<00:04:25.020> I<00:04:25.229> think<00:04:25.979> as<00:04:26.190> a<00:04:26.250> foundation

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
doesn't transfer I think as a foundation

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.640 
doesn't transfer I think as a foundation
for<00:04:27.090> a<00:04:27.360> nice<00:04:27.630> like<00:04:28.020> medium<00:04:28.350> to<00:04:28.470> full<00:04:28.620> coverage

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
for a nice like medium to full coverage
