 hello everyone with you ivan 145 and in this 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.540
 the boxing box tinkering I will tell you about 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.040
 how to buy an inexpensive arcade 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.099
 xbox 360 stick 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.900
 This is not an ordinary release because 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.710
 a few days ago I went to 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.109
 Journey and will soon be on Igromir 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.859
 well so far i had free time i 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.619
 decided to buy an arcade stick in general 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.710
 tell a little story like so 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.730
 It turned out for many years I love 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.730
 fighting games 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.890
 and I learned that many professional 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.050
 filters play in the arcade sticks it 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.280
 such panels with buttons such a stick 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.670
 which were originally based on 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.140
 arcade machines and in general, all 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.989
 started with this fighting game 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.969
 associated with it but to buy 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.840
 such an arcade stick you need to spend 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.449
 a lot of time effort and money on 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.859
 at least until recently to 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.559
 buy arcade stick needed 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.439
 spend at least 5 to 7 thousand 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.210
 it was necessary either to order incomprehensible 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.430
 from where 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.670
 expensive stick or collect its amount 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:19.080
 the parts themselves were very large 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:21.090
 money but recently i found a very good 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.280
 stick which is included in the collection 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.500
 edition of one great game and worth 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.409
 only 3 and a half thousand rubles and 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.650
 this is for xbox 360 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:35.509
 this stick was stick from the collection 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:39.049
 xbox 360 editions 16 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:41.909
 this edition came out quite a long time ago 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:45.060
 In general, then when he came out he feels 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.860
 that I bought a video game is not on it 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.079
 not the only place now doing by 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.920
 such a price can be bought for what they 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.470
 thank you very much 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.640
 i'm not sure what this stick is 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:02:00.840
 turned out to be new can be repacked 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:05.259
 but the stick is generally totally working and 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.969
 full equipment is here like this 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.429
 Looks like the box itself 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:12.760
 I will unpack I will show what is inside 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.300
 here we see art from the game and this is what 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.720

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.540
 collectible editions every glass 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:24.940
 from torment here from us in different languages 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:28.470
 descriptions packed very strange 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:31.470
 by their store employees that's how they are 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.239
 explained it was necessary in order to 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.700
 they hid to sort out 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:40.060
 the strain is stick that everything matches 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:46.900
 and get everything right from here 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:53.530

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:01.840
 there are all the characters from the game and 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:05.440
 neatly set out so in general 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:08.109
 instruction for arcade stick all 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.069
 portrayed no buttons how to insert 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:15.910
 batteries are nothing special now 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:20.130
 let's take a look at myself so this 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:24.609
 the box opens here we have 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.989
 the game itself is this 6 by the way great 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:26.739

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:38.920
 popular by the way further we go to 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.980
 Well, by the way, the sixth is very big, and I 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.980
 I did not even know that he would be so 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:49.350
 thick here it is colored 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:54.420
 in english is very cool 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:04:01.050
 and we finally have ourselves stick here 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:09.630
 so here is packed with blue package let's 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:11.940
 weâ€™ll get it now in general 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.550
 standard classic style which 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.620
 you can purchase at any 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:21.470
 online store that trade 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:24.210
 arcade sticky is the corporate identity 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.950
 licensed for xbox 360 from the company 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.360
 the choir 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.790
 written it is very famous 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:33.390
 manufacturer of arcade sticks 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.110
 they have very good qualities 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.980
 products 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:41.280
 Well, as we see, and then the firm 16 stick 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:43.620
 here there are in public darta on 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.810
 sticky goes on 6 buttons 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.200
 but on some there are 8 buttons that is 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.090
 two extra defaults in my 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.280
 these buttons are not used 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.680
 you can program them yourself for 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.810
 construction sites but the air depends on the fights 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.120
 Some fights have more 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.090
 buttons are used in some less 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:07.680
 Well, these are the details for beginners 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:12.020
 Potter is not necessary need to know with us here 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:15.840
 there is a run start the main button dashboard 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.000
 sync button connector for 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:23.510
 microphone 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:29.100
 here we have a battery compartment 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:32.310
 such protective pads in general such 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:36.090
 good stick i checked it on 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:39.780
 absolutely working very comfortable to play 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:42.000
 it is clear that if you already play fighting games on 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.560
 gamepad you will have a long time 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.150
 relearn because you wear 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.370
 completely different game well 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.650
 and not everyone can change from a gamepad 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:55.660
 caught up but believe it is worth it this 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:56.380
 the history of fighting games is the only negative 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.510
 which the 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.710
 if this stick which I have found so far 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:05.040
 for itself is its size because 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:07.510
 usually sticks that I saw purchased 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:10.150
 acquaintances they somehow more 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:11.200
 they have any such compartments for 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.810
 cable 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.860
 here and they have the ability to connect 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.670
 exactly here by cable 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:20.890
 what 's very cool there delay 

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:23.710
 the signal will be very small by 

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:26.320
 versus wireless data transmission 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:29.050
 and maybe it would all work like 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:32.520
 anything on xbox one will it work 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:36.100
 on xbox one is unknown but none the less 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:38.830
 style is fairly inexpensive and I advise 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:41.860
 get it to everyone who wants to start 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:46.000
 play fighting games like that 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:49.830
 devices in general on this all with you 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.830
 I was 145 all bye
