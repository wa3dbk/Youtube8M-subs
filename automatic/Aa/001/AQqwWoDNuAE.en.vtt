00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
I guess for those people that are

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.899 
I guess for those people that are
looking<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.719> be<00:02:03.930> some<00:02:04.200> huge<00:02:04.979> entrepreneur<00:02:05.670> and

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
looking to be some huge entrepreneur and

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.690 
looking to be some huge entrepreneur and
in<00:02:06.360> school<00:02:06.840> just<00:02:07.079> makes<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.710> well-balanced

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
in school just makes you a well-balanced

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.720 
in school just makes you a well-balanced
educated<00:02:09.509> person<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.440> is<00:02:10.560> so<00:02:10.920> important

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
educated person and it is so important

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.260
