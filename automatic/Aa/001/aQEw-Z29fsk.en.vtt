00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.260
 alphonse 

00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:14.109
 m 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:25.259
 the self 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:26.939
 the 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.579
 that I knew 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.579
 it's the beginning of the year m 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.070
 what a shame for him 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.070
 Chalons Champagne 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.530
 at the break half at 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.530
 there are less 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.940
 he is 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.940
 the data they contain 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.540
 the parmalat crash 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.840
 and that's about 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.840
 to the program today a bit like yael naim and other sure 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.470
 to do it 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:25.620
 before she 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.930
 for me you are here 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.910
 it is very natural 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.080
 it will not be 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.080
 I think, however, I am 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.970
 Why 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.380

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.380
 I did it 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.369
 what is worse and worse their projects 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.470
 actually say it after the record facts 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.150

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.630
 the same he actually 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.460
 why 1 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.460
 that day and again ie 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.099
 seeing there 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.099
 but while we club traveling 

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:19.169
 the cayenne ouattara 

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:22.169

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:29.639
