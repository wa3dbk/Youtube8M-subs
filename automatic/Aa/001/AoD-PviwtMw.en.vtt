00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.120
 and find an effective way to 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.980
 perform our hair without heat is a 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.780
 you want for many of us that 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.110
 we want to find a way to carry 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.300
 the hair fixed but without spoiling it 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.880
 after trying millions of techniques 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.790
 I have found this and without a doubt it is the most 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.060
 Effective comfortable and easy practice 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:30.260
 do 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.780
 we're just going to need a handkerchief 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.850
 before starting with the procedure is 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.070
 important that our dog is wet 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.650
 but nothing wet is to say that it is 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.140
 about to dry when we are ready 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.360
 we have to pass the handkerchief all over the 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.360
 hair so that the latter stays in the 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.460
 center 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.829
 we can make a ponytail so that we 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.260
 be easier 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.000
 the position of this depends on how 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.250
 we want to stay curls 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.649
 how I like to start well 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.589
 high on the front part opens me 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.659
 the whole process upside down once what 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:05.610
 let's have the handkerchief rolled up a little 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:07.860
 about itself so that it will grip comes 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.080
 to the hair and this one does not go away 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.229
 we will go down to the tips and once there 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.420
 we will go rolling the hair with the handkerchief 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.670
 until we reach the end when we finish 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.320
 we will throw the two parts of the handkerchief 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.320
 back and we'll make a knot 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.409
 once we have all but just like that 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.170
 It has to wait for it to dry 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.990
 I advise you completely leave him 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.570
 all night since it is very comfortable and not 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.190
 it shows that you're wearing what I 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.170
 I have verified that having so much 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.780
 surface on which the hair is placed 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.850
 dries much earlier because the layers of 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.399
 hair of each piece of handkerchief are very 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.259
 fine and that's what the difference of 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.299
 other techniques such as curls 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.610
 braids or roll up hair on a 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.350
 tape in which the layers of hair are 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.390
 so thick that it's impossible for 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.399
 a lot of time that passes will come by 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.920
 complete and therefore they take well the 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.619
 curl shape 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.810
 the next morning we undo the knot 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.030
 we remove the handkerchief and we will see that the 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.150
 result are round waves 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.160
 big and beautiful the truth is that I've 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.140
 tried many techniques and until the 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.480
 This is the moment that has best gone to 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.980
 my hair I love the result 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.140
 love the time that lasts me and what 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.780
 comfortable that is I hope you liked it 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.910
 the video that if you put it into practice I 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.680
 you put it then instagram and see you in 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.680
 the next a little kiss
