00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
you can see there's not a lot of support

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
one started right here as you could

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.020 
one started right here as you could
clearly<00:00:27.930> see<00:00:28.050> this<00:00:28.380> was<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:30.349> the<00:00:31.349> top<00:00:32.030> that

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
clearly see this was the the top that

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.510 
clearly see this was the the top that
goes<00:00:33.469> on<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.590> hear<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.829> just<00:00:35.010> flip<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.250> all<00:00:35.430> the

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
goes on to hear you just flip it all the

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.350 
goes on to hear you just flip it all the
way<00:00:35.610> around<00:00:36.590> tape<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.739> right<00:00:37.860> here<00:00:38.210> tape<00:00:39.210> or

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
way around tape it right here tape or

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.650 
way around tape it right here tape or
wherever<00:00:39.649> RV<00:00:40.649> need<00:00:40.770> support<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.660> that's

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
wherever RV need support and that's

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.830 
wherever RV need support and that's
basically<00:00:42.960> half<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:43.950> right<00:00:44.129> there<00:00:44.840> the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
basically half of it right there the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.310 
basically half of it right there the
next<00:00:46.110> part<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.910> this<00:00:48.320> and<00:00:49.850> I<00:00:51.079> wanted<00:00:52.079> something

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
next part is this and I wanted something

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.510 
next part is this and I wanted something
tricky<00:00:52.649> kinda<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:53.910> made<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.329> like<00:00:54.449> an<00:00:54.629> invert

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
tricky kinda so I made it like an invert

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.060 
tricky kinda so I made it like an invert
indented<00:00:56.520> art<00:00:56.969> thing<00:00:57.500> as<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.649> can<00:00:58.770> see<00:00:58.920> that

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
indented art thing as you can see that

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.779 
indented art thing as you can see that
and<00:00:59.539> to<00:01:00.539> do<00:01:00.660> this<00:01:01.250> all<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.399> need<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.579> do<00:01:02.760> is

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
and to do this all you need to do is

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.480 
and to do this all you need to do is
like<00:01:03.149> in<00:01:03.600> mice<00:01:04.549> in<00:01:05.549> my<00:01:06.060> half<00:01:06.450> pipe<00:01:07.310> tutorial<00:01:08.310> i

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
like in mice in my half pipe tutorial i

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.570 
like in mice in my half pipe tutorial i
show<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.700> how<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.210> cut<00:01:09.750> out<00:01:09.869> i<00:01:10.080> guess<00:01:10.369> but<00:01:11.369> you

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
show you how to cut out i guess but you

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.690 
show you how to cut out i guess but you
basically<00:01:11.880> cut<00:01:12.119> out<00:01:12.320> two<00:01:13.320> shapes<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:14.100> every

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
basically cut out two shapes of every

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.990 
basically cut out two shapes of every
kind<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:15.000> ramp<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.299> want<00:01:15.509> as<00:01:16.610> I<00:01:17.610> don't<00:01:17.909> know

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
kind of ramp you want as I don't know

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.760 
kind of ramp you want as I don't know
maybe<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.299> could<00:01:18.390> see<00:01:21.530> but<00:01:22.530> it's<00:01:22.619> like

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
maybe you could see but it's like

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.149 
maybe you could see but it's like
bending<00:01:23.450> it's<00:01:24.450> like<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.750> curved<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:26.119> curved

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
bending it's like a curved a curved

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.179 
bending it's like a curved a curved
curved<00:01:29.159> shapes<00:01:29.520> cut<00:01:29.820> out<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.770> I<00:01:31.770> have<00:01:31.920> two<00:01:32.070> of

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
curved shapes cut out and I have two of

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.010 
curved shapes cut out and I have two of
them<00:01:32.369> on<00:01:32.430> each<00:01:32.460> side<00:01:33.829> they<00:01:34.829> this<00:01:35.549> stuff<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.990> i

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
them on each side they this stuff that i

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.510 
them on each side they this stuff that i
use<00:01:37.200> for<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.740> support<00:01:38.659> was<00:01:40.159> out<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.220> that

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
use for the support was out of that

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.080 
use for the support was out of that
binder<00:01:41.970> like<00:01:42.299> binder<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.930> know<00:01:43.909> one<00:01:44.909> inch

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
binder like binder you know one inch

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.590 
binder like binder you know one inch
binders<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.659> stuff<00:01:45.810> they<00:01:45.930> use<00:01:46.079> for<00:01:46.110> class<00:01:46.500> I

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
binders and stuff they use for class I
