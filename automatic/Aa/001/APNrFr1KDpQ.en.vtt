00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:11.610
 headlines of the strange ones flipped today 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.900
 it's at the end of season old flash and 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.700
 with this chapter a stage closes 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.500
 for the series of times on the screen 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.449
 girl making it clear that if they do not make it 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.580
 in the cinema at least they know what they do 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.230
 in flash television was the first spin 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.300
 off of arrow srl since he started this 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.340
 television universe in 2012 from 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.080
 then both series have been suggesting 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.820
 a bigger world with references 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.800
 constants to the universe of comics 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.420
 now the universe of this one goes one step further 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.190
 with the next premiere of the legends of 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.960
 tomorrow a series that we will see 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.000
 several of the known characters and 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.910
 some new ones face a threat 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.399
 that a single hero or villain can not 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.920
 stop hack grow up some why can not 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.780

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.730

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.780
 stop to band the Sabbath in immortal 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.730
 villain of the league of justice and of 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.530
 step create something like avengers for 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.730
 because they do not dare to join the 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.680
 league still 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.090
 to be sure they only keep for 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.350
 films 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.400
 if you have not seen flash yet 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.740
 we recommend seeing them it looks like this 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.330
 He already saw another series expected 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.310
 in the supercross and finally we have a 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.350
 first preview of what will be but still 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.580
 we do not know what to think on the one hand you see 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.780
 different from the other series of 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.460
 superheroes that we have seen until the 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.930
 moment has a more feminine tone 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.850
 girls from town in the big city 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.680
 trying to decide what to do with your 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.420
 we've seen it before in several 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.790
 movies and series and they usually load a 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.620
 positive message nothing wrong with that fits 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.960
 with enough of the representations of 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.250
 the superman cousin on the other hand we 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.720
 remember a bit the parody of 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.640
 saturday night lights' on a 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.780
 movie with black widow maybe not 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.250
 can tell the story of a 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.960
 superheroine who has other 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.090
 concerns that do not appear removed 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.190
 of a romance novel 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.840
 good is still the first sight let's hope 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.840
 to see how the series soars up 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.920
 finally we want to tell you that in a 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.570
 era of so many remakes and reboot no 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.840

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.970

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.030
 this new park will not commit the same 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.400
 mistakes that scientists made 20 years ago 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.570

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.520
 steps in the field of engineering 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.320

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.490
