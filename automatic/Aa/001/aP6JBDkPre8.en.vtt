strength and speed and this robot is

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.170 
strength and speed and this robot is
really<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.010> first<00:01:11.220> robot<00:01:11.670> in<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.820> world<00:01:11.970> to

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
be included in combat squads so we've

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.060 
be included in combat squads so we've

how<00:04:30.470> can<00:04:30.830> you<00:04:30.979> make<00:04:31.220> a<00:04:31.460> hovering<00:04:31.940> system<00:04:32.419> safe

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
how can you make a hovering system safe

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.980 
how can you make a hovering system safe
well<00:04:33.650> one<00:04:34.100> idea<00:04:34.280> was<00:04:34.790> tie<00:04:35.390> a<00:04:35.419> whole<00:04:35.660> bunch<00:04:35.870> of

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
well one idea was tie a whole bunch of

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.670 
well one idea was tie a whole bunch of
balloons<00:04:36.260> to<00:04:36.470> balloons<00:04:37.100> are<00:04:37.310> safe<00:04:37.550> right

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
balloons to balloons are safe right

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.560 
balloons to balloons are safe right
another<00:04:39.680> idea<00:04:40.280> was<00:04:40.640> let's<00:04:41.630> make<00:04:42.320> it<00:04:42.350> work<00:04:43.040> like

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
another idea was let's make it work like

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.219 
another idea was let's make it work like
a<00:04:44.570> big<00:04:45.080> vacuum<00:04:45.410> cleaner<00:04:46.040> where<00:04:46.790> it's<00:04:47.390> sucking

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:48.229 
a big vacuum cleaner where it's sucking

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:51.700 
a big vacuum cleaner where it's sucking
air<00:04:48.740> and<00:04:49.270> blowing<00:04:50.270> air<00:04:50.419> out<00:04:50.660> the<00:04:50.870> back<00:04:51.080> end<00:04:51.470> and

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
air and blowing air out the back end and

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.210 
air and blowing air out the back end and
that'll<00:04:52.310> make<00:04:52.610> it<00:04:52.850> fly<00:04:53.410> another<00:04:54.410> idea<00:04:54.950> well

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
that'll make it fly another idea well

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.350 
that'll make it fly another idea well
let's<00:04:55.729> just<00:04:56.090> wrap<00:04:56.390> a<00:04:56.419> big<00:04:56.900> shroud<00:04:57.470> around<00:04:58.360> the

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
let's just wrap a big shroud around the

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.130 
let's just wrap a big shroud around the
rotor<00:04:59.800> and<00:05:00.800> that<00:05:01.310> will<00:05:01.610> make<00:05:01.850> it<00:05:01.910> safe<00:05:02.570> it's

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
rotor and that will make it safe it's

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.040 
rotor and that will make it safe it's
freeform<00:05:03.950> thinking<00:05:04.640> to<00:05:05.150> get<00:05:05.450> the<00:05:05.690> creative

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
freeform thinking to get the creative

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.130 
freeform thinking to get the creative
juices<00:05:06.490> flowing<00:05:07.490> and<00:05:07.640> that<00:05:07.790> brings<00:05:08.330> a<00:05:08.660> lot<00:05:09.080> of

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
juices flowing and that brings a lot of

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.700 
juices flowing and that brings a lot of
energy

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710

I<00:05:09.950> really<00:05:10.550> believe<00:05:10.880> an<00:05:11.200> innovator<00:05:12.200> does<00:05:12.740> have

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
I really believe an innovator does have

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.690 
I really believe an innovator does have
to<00:05:13.190> be<00:05:13.310> a<00:05:13.340> kid<00:05:14.300> at<00:05:14.690> heart<00:05:15.050> a<00:05:15.410> kid<00:05:16.010> who<00:05:16.160> likes<00:05:16.400> to

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 
to be a kid at heart a kid who likes to

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.420 
to be a kid at heart a kid who likes to
think<00:05:16.760> outside<00:05:17.750> the<00:05:17.780> box<00:05:18.110> think<00:05:18.680> of<00:05:18.950> putting

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
think outside the box think of putting

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.240 
think outside the box think of putting
things<00:05:19.729> together<00:05:20.060> in<00:05:21.020> ways<00:05:21.410> that<00:05:21.890> you<00:05:22.039> have

things together in ways that you have

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.640 
things together in ways that you have
not<00:05:22.490> before<00:05:22.940> it's<00:05:23.600> kind<00:05:23.900> of<00:05:23.930> like<00:05:24.110> a<00:05:24.140> game<00:05:24.440> of
