00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 today this is probably this 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.359
 last video of me on my channel 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.830
 with this microphone so with my 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.870
 rohde microphone with that I have too 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.759
 My news is always made though 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.620
 the problem that I have a relative here 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.389
 have big space in which I record and 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.650
 I always have a lot of reverb and that 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.550
 Of course, if it's on the microphone 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.240
 camera is always a bit stuck 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.650
 away 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.300
 that's why I already have some 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.859
 time said I absolutely needed 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.779
 level the microphone so an increase 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.609
 micro that i am here on my t-shirt 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.660
 or to my hampton can infect and 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.789
 so that the sound is better then one 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.170
 a bit bass-heavy and with less 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.610
 of course, I have myself 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.530
 now informed and 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.829
 kindly have me now 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.870
 colleagues of edge a lavallee microphone 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.210
 namely the etm 006 for disposal 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.890
 and I wanted that now 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.820
 easy time boxing and one you 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.410
 show a bit and then right now 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.940
 still a comparison video to the 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.590
 single microphones show 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.260
 yes that is in different 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.579
 Cable lengths once with five meters that 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.989
 Here are five meters with me 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.399
 So a little bit of leeway and 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.870
 then I believe with ten meters 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.690
 a bit shorter and longer and that 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.309
 costs about 70 euros a yes I would 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.080
 say that's sort of an entry 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.630
 caballÃ© so there are definitely still 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.130
 much more expensive so natural is that 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.560
 now stupid unboxing because I hold this 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.880
 but should keep in the microphone 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.040
 next or in the next videos 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.150
 I will definitely be there 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.810
 in any case, the solarworld microphone 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.070
 then I have two again 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.780
 Hands free that's a little bit better 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.920
 So I'll put that on here now 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.110
 between the legs 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.960
 here again the cover while the 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.670
 microphones tdm 0 06 in any case very much 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.869
 well that something still inside the 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.350
 well , it's time to go out 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.960
 no matter 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.970
 then I put this down again 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.460
 The whole thing is packed in such a 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.650
 sneak cover in such a bag here 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.810
 stands again equity trust your sound 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.930
 but unpack the whole time like 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.409
 said 5 meters I really needed 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.960
 yet a new hand a new time 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.790
 down there on the floor because I'm allowed to 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.649
 it does not look so special right now 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.040
 is on the side but the microphone that sees 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.320
 so out of here once the microphone and then 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.450
 we have this clip here 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.740
 to cling to the shirt there you can 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.290
 then stop here and press that 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.580
 Open up and you can hope I can 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.810
 understands me now it is not perfect 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.349
 with the man song can now so 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.990
 agree 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.490
 that's just the head protection 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.420
 That's why I think my microphone 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.000
 you probably can see that 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.440
 not at all and my chair can do that 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.110
 We'll do it again here 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.250
 and then or we will leave it now 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.620
 just times I have no hands free 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.020
 for that you can then under the t 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.370
 perform a shirt and then here so hard 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.520
 make and then you have a pretty 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.830
 good sound is this microphone 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.360
 this level only once for dsl so 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.100
 for example, you can know me 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.410
 then simply plug in the jack and 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.550
 then start immediately problem is one 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.990
 bit with this microphone that is 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.640
 ironed relatively loud that is if I 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.800
 then you have to plug it in from the 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.240
 Camera off in manual mode if possible 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.290
 not in automatic mode again 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.210
 a bit quieter level 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.620
 that's the only big problem 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.360
 You can also do that live 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.010
 action fights such as the 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.980
 gopro then needs however 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.190
 one then with the gopro an adapter and 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.570
 Although from von Klinke one sees 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:09.000
 yes here here the jack connection 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.560
 on micro not on micro but on 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.270
 mini usb or can it be there too 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.860
 After that, it's definitely good 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.140
 because these live action games like the old ones 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.850
 gopro not so good microphones sound 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.260
 and now i would say im 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.790
 Connection is definitely coming in now 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.110
 comparison video between mine 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.730
 different microphones so like yourself 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.500
 that sounds like it's probably 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.780
 the most interesting and indeed once 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.050
 between the laval here now my 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.459
 microphone then between my rohde with 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.750
 I normally received the news in 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.090
 have and once with the internal 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.280
 recognize microphone from there you will be on 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.840
 hear some differences and every case 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.920
 in the next news are then or is 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.380
 then probably most of the time 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.600
 lavallee the tolerable microphones here 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.950
 and then you can do it better 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.450
 understand because with the healing and so that 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.000
 was a bit annoying okay then 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.350
 now to the comparison video and there 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.510
 we are already synonymous with the comparison video 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.370
 my three microphones with the beginners 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.560
 the internal microphone of my canon 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.060
 Camera and you probably hear that 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.830
 it actually sounded the worst 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.350
 not so bad but of course 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.300
 relatively much keeper and compass and it 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.410
 It just sounds like shit and me 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.060
 I would say I just say 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.980
 few sentences for example sony has now 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.790
 officially announced that they are on 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.159
 this year's gamescom no press 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.440
 conference and now 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:20.350
 next we will look at each other 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.780
 Let's listen to the internal so that 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.060
 external without microphone to the plug I 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.860
 then now on my canon camera that 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.630
 is already much better but a 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.949
 a bit more tinkering 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.990
 that probably still knows from the 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:34.270
 Last news issues so now I have 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.949
 the red microphone as an external microphone 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.870
 once on my know on top 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:39.610
 as well as in the last news 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.080
 over and you can hear came a 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.850
 a little bit halder but that is all 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.080
 just yes from the vote bit 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.699
 heavier a bit more bass in it 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.500
 you can just understand me better 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:49.150
 It's just I do not know how to do it 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.180
 I say it will be easy overall 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.979
 better with a bit stronger and me 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.599
 say my sentence for example sony has 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:56.889
 now announced that they have no 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:59.020
 press conference at this year's 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:00.639
 gamescom 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.710
 and then we come to the third 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:04.449
 microphone and that to the microphone 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.130
 I now in the next blogs and in 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:10.000
 will then use the next news 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:11.889
 Us the label em 006 was here 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.900
 already been attached to me 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:16.180
 beautiful so now we come to the 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.909
 la wally microphone from et jut thats her 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.110
 once here is the whole microphone is 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:21.159
 the likelihood is very good 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.199
 sound quality now again 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:24.820
 a little better even less stop 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:26.260
 that's a bit more bass though 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.530
 problem actually like I did at the beginning 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:31.449
 already mentioned that the level one 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.430
 too loud or the level of the 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:35.199
 from home comes a bit too 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.789
 it's a bit too loud 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:38.919
 If you then in manual mode 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:40.720
 with the canon picks up then you have the 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:42.159
 relatively far down level with it 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.699
 not overdriven can be me 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:43.570
 now again a bit 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:44.680
 override 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.479
 you definitely need a bit 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.800
 perhaps a cameraman of the 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:49.659
 then he understands and understands 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.070
 has of the audio settings 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:53.260
 yes i have to say i like it all 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.639
 that mtt tm 0 and 6 really very good and 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.500
 I have to say at this point again 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:58.419
 in any case many thanks to rt that 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.590
 this microphone for me here 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:01.150
 especially for 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.740
 The news I find a very cool thing 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.169
 I 've got something of that, too 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.610
 simply a better sound quality and 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:07.780
 I will definitely do that now 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.460
 I use that more often as I said 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.590
 now my first lavalin microphone can 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.090
 as his that yes the sound quality 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.199
 it will be a bit better because of me 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.460
 Of course, also learn and maybe 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:16.900
 will be in the next time to one 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.659
 other things that you can do it yourself 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.770
 looks at or listens to and perhaps was 

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:21.820
 the video now for you all 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.560
 interesting means a little 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.539
 comparative video as I record 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.110
 or what do I do that way? 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:27.400
 do it if 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.870
 I just do not let's play videos
