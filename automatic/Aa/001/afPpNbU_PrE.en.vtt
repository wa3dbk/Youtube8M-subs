00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480

scope<00:00:38.629> of<00:00:38.960> what<00:00:39.170> comes<00:00:39.500> with<00:00:39.800> Lightroom<00:00:40.160> and

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:40.580 
scope of what comes with Lightroom and

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.329 
scope of what comes with Lightroom and
these<00:00:41.210> are<00:00:41.420> very<00:00:41.900> very<00:00:42.350> easy<00:00:42.470> to<00:00:43.100> create

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:43.339 
these are very very easy to create

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:45.759 
these are very very easy to create
oftentimes<00:00:44.150> I<00:00:44.420> will<00:00:44.479> create<00:00:44.900> a<00:00:44.989> brush<00:00:45.440> tool

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:45.769 
oftentimes I will create a brush tool

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:48.280 
oftentimes I will create a brush tool
because<00:00:46.489> I<00:00:46.519> might<00:00:46.879> be<00:00:46.909> editing<00:00:47.540> in<00:00:47.720> multiple

because I might be editing in multiple
things<00:00:48.589> that<00:00:48.739> I<00:00:48.890> want<00:00:49.280> to<00:00:49.400> be<00:00:49.699> able<00:00:49.879> to<00:00:50.000> have

things that I want to be able to have

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:53.500 
things that I want to be able to have
those<00:00:50.989> settings<00:00:51.530> available<00:00:51.680> now<00:00:52.489> like<00:00:53.269> with

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
those settings available now like with

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.719 
those settings available now like with
any<00:00:53.750> preset<00:00:54.260> and<00:00:54.409> I've<00:00:54.470> told<00:00:54.739> you<00:00:54.890> this<00:00:55.129> before

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:55.729 
any preset and I've told you this before

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:58.750 
any preset and I've told you this before
in<00:00:56.239> other<00:00:56.390> context<00:00:57.290> like<00:00:57.799> with<00:00:57.979> any<00:00:58.129> preset

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
in other context like with any preset

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.660 
in other context like with any preset
just<00:00:59.720> because<00:01:00.049> you<00:01:00.199> have<00:01:00.500> a<00:01:00.530> preset<00:01:01.250> does<00:01:01.460> not

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
just because you have a preset does not

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.570 
just because you have a preset does not
obligate<00:01:02.449> you<00:01:02.689> or<00:01:02.930> limit<00:01:03.350> you<00:01:03.530> to<00:01:03.739> utilizing

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
obligate you or limit you to utilizing

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.179 
obligate you or limit you to utilizing
the<00:01:05.170> parameters<00:01:06.170> of<00:01:06.200> that<00:01:06.439> preset<00:01:06.860> meaning

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
the parameters of that preset meaning

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:08.920 
the parameters of that preset meaning
that<00:01:07.310> oftentimes<00:01:07.640> I<00:01:08.150> will<00:01:08.360> start<00:01:08.689> with<00:01:08.869> a

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
that oftentimes I will start with a

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.530 
that oftentimes I will start with a
preset<00:01:09.500> and<00:01:09.740> then<00:01:10.400> I<00:01:10.700> will<00:01:10.880> modify<00:01:11.299> it

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
preset and then I will modify it

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.510 
preset and then I will modify it
accordingly<00:01:12.229> depending<00:01:12.560> on<00:01:13.010> the<00:01:13.159> image<00:01:13.490> that

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
accordingly depending on the image that

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.020 
accordingly depending on the image that
I'm<00:01:14.200> editing<00:01:15.200> okay<00:01:15.649> so<00:01:16.070> for<00:01:16.340> example<00:01:16.369> with

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
I'm editing okay so for example with

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.349 
I'm editing okay so for example with
this<00:01:17.359> portrait<00:01:17.960> right<00:01:18.229> here<00:01:18.560> I<00:01:19.399> would

00:01:20.349 --> 00:01:20.359 
this portrait right here I would

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:22.810 
this portrait right here I would
probably<00:01:20.719> want<00:01:21.200> to<00:01:21.350> maybe<00:01:21.649> just<00:01:21.920> reduce<00:01:22.609> a

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
probably want to maybe just reduce a

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.209 
probably want to maybe just reduce a
little<00:01:23.000> bit<00:01:23.149> of<00:01:23.420> the<00:01:23.570> lines<00:01:23.840> and<00:01:24.439> maybe<00:01:24.920> some

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:25.219 
little bit of the lines and maybe some

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:27.399 
little bit of the lines and maybe some

he's a young guy he's got good skin he
doesn't<00:01:29.329> really<00:01:29.420> need<00:01:29.630> a<00:01:29.659> lot<00:01:29.840> of<00:01:29.869> work<00:01:30.049> and<00:01:30.259> as

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
doesn't really need a lot of work and as

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.590 
doesn't really need a lot of work and as
far<00:01:30.950> as<00:01:31.009> guys<00:01:31.249> go<00:01:31.490> I<00:01:31.670> don't<00:01:31.820> like<00:01:31.999> to<00:01:32.119> go<00:01:32.240> crazy

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
far as guys go I don't like to go crazy

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.539 
far as guys go I don't like to go crazy
I<00:01:32.749> might<00:01:33.020> even<00:01:33.170> want<00:01:33.409> to<00:01:33.499> remove<00:01:33.950> that<00:01:34.009> blemish

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
I might even want to remove that blemish

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:36.099 
I might even want to remove that blemish
but<00:01:34.700> that's<00:01:34.909> separate<00:01:35.390> from<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:35.719> brush<00:01:35.929> tool

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:36.109 
but that's separate from the brush tool

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:38.260 
but that's separate from the brush tool
anyway<00:01:36.499> so<00:01:37.130> what<00:01:37.369> I<00:01:37.399> would<00:01:37.520> do<00:01:37.820> here<00:01:38.090> is<00:01:38.149> I

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
anyway so what I would do here is I

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.029 
anyway so what I would do here is I
would<00:01:38.479> zoom<00:01:38.840> in<00:01:39.049> I<00:01:39.200> would<00:01:39.380> go<00:01:39.560> one<00:01:39.829> two<00:01:40.009> one

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
would zoom in I would go one two one

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:42.639 
would zoom in I would go one two one

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
mask does is that means that it will

mask out areas that are of different

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:18.520 
mask out areas that are of different
contrast<00:03:17.510> so<00:03:17.719> that'll<00:03:17.989> really<00:03:18.260> kind<00:03:18.469> of

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
contrast so that'll really kind of

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.770 
contrast so that'll really kind of
restrict<00:03:19.069> the<00:03:19.579> brush<00:03:19.849> tool<00:03:20.120> to<00:03:20.150> a<00:03:20.359> certain

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
restrict the brush tool to a certain

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.110 
restrict the brush tool to a certain
area<00:03:21.049> okay<00:03:21.739> and<00:03:22.010> I<00:03:22.370> have<00:03:22.459> the<00:03:22.579> density<00:03:23.000> on

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
area okay and I have the density on

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.580 
area okay and I have the density on
hundreds<00:03:23.540> that<00:03:23.719> means<00:03:23.930> that<00:03:24.169> it's<00:03:24.290> going<00:03:24.469> to

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
hundreds that means that it's going to

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.280 
hundreds that means that it's going to
basically<00:03:25.219> apply<00:03:25.430> this<00:03:25.760> in<00:03:26.329> its<00:03:26.780> fullest

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
basically apply this in its fullest

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.039 
basically apply this in its fullest
amount<00:03:27.739> where<00:03:28.069> the<00:03:28.549> center<00:03:28.970> or<00:03:29.359> the<00:03:29.569> region<00:03:29.930> of

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
amount where the center or the region of

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.710 
amount where the center or the region of
the<00:03:30.139> center<00:03:30.409> circle<00:03:30.829> is<00:03:30.949> okay<00:03:31.310> so<00:03:31.939> now<00:03:32.150> without

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
the center circle is okay so now without

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
you can see that area as I start to pull

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.959 
you can see that area as I start to pull
it<00:05:00.050> down<00:05:00.110> it<00:05:00.499> starts<00:05:00.800> to<00:05:00.949> remove<00:05:01.340> a<00:05:01.550> little<00:05:01.849> bit

00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:01.969 
it down it starts to remove a little bit

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:05.439 
it down it starts to remove a little bit
of<00:05:02.060> the<00:05:02.120> clarity<00:05:02.599> those<00:05:03.080> mid-tones<00:05:04.009> are<00:05:04.490> that

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:05.449 
of the clarity those mid-tones are that

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:07.629 
of the clarity those mid-tones are that
mid-tone<00:05:05.930> highlight<00:05:06.379> detail<00:05:06.770> is<00:05:07.039> is<00:05:07.279> starting

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:07.639 
mid-tone highlight detail is is starting

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:10.119 
mid-tone highlight detail is is starting
to<00:05:07.729> reduce<00:05:07.909> okay<00:05:08.539> that's<00:05:08.749> very<00:05:08.990> cool<00:05:09.319> now<00:05:09.889> what

00:05:10.119 --> 00:05:10.129 
to reduce okay that's very cool now what

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:11.679

I<00:05:10.159> also<00:05:10.400> want<00:05:10.819> to<00:05:10.879> do<00:05:11.000> is<00:05:11.120> I<00:05:11.240> might<00:05:11.449> want<00:05:11.629> to

00:05:11.679 --> 00:05:11.689 
I also want to do is I might want to

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:13.959 
I also want to do is I might want to
just<00:05:11.870> reduce<00:05:11.990> the<00:05:12.319> saturation<00:05:12.500> just<00:05:13.039> a<00:05:13.400> just<00:05:13.849> a

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:13.969 
just reduce the saturation just a just a

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:16.480 
just reduce the saturation just a just a
slight<00:05:14.210> touch<00:05:14.479> like<00:05:14.750> that<00:05:14.779> okay<00:05:15.710> and<00:05:15.949> at<00:05:16.340> the

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
slight touch like that okay and at the

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.100 
slight touch like that okay and at the
same<00:05:16.639> time<00:05:16.879> I<00:05:17.060> might<00:05:17.270> want<00:05:17.449> to<00:05:17.509> just<00:05:17.689> pump<00:05:17.960> up

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
same time I might want to just pump up

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.320 
same time I might want to just pump up
the<00:05:18.199> exposure<00:05:18.620> just<00:05:18.919> a<00:05:19.400> little<00:05:19.639> bit<00:05:19.849> okay

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
the exposure just a little bit okay

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.659 
the exposure just a little bit okay
something<00:05:21.050> in<00:05:21.229> that<00:05:21.259> region<00:05:21.800> right<00:05:22.009> there<00:05:22.340> and

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
something in that region right there and

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:25.269 
something in that region right there and
we<00:05:23.120> could<00:05:23.270> also<00:05:23.479> we<00:05:23.870> could<00:05:24.020> we<00:05:24.590> could<00:05:24.740> take<00:05:25.159> the

00:05:25.269 --> 00:05:25.279 
we could also we could we could take the

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:27.519 
we could also we could we could take the
sharpness<00:05:25.610> up<00:05:25.879> and<00:05:26.300> make<00:05:26.629> that<00:05:26.810> area<00:05:26.990> sharper

00:05:27.519 --> 00:05:27.529 
sharpness up and make that area sharper

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:29.350 
sharpness up and make that area sharper
but<00:05:27.710> we<00:05:27.800> don't<00:05:28.069> want<00:05:28.279> to<00:05:28.370> do<00:05:28.520> that<00:05:28.699> we<00:05:29.210> can

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
but we don't want to do that we can

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.059 
but we don't want to do that we can
bring<00:05:29.539> the<00:05:29.659> sharpness<00:05:29.990> down<00:05:30.349> but<00:05:30.680> it<00:05:30.860> also

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:31.069 
bring the sharpness down but it also

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:33.670 
bring the sharpness down but it also
desaturates<00:05:32.029> it<00:05:32.180> and<00:05:32.270> it<00:05:32.360> looks<00:05:32.509> d<00:05:32.960> focuses<00:05:33.529> it

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
desaturates it and it looks d focuses it

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.499 
desaturates it and it looks d focuses it
and<00:05:33.770> it<00:05:33.830> looks<00:05:34.039> kind<00:05:34.250> of<00:05:34.310> funny<00:05:34.550> so<00:05:35.060> maybe<00:05:35.330> we

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:35.509 
and it looks kind of funny so maybe we

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:37.390 
and it looks kind of funny so maybe we
just<00:05:35.719> knock<00:05:35.960> beside<00:05:36.409> the<00:05:36.740> sharpness<00:05:37.099> down

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
just knock beside the sharpness down

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.820 
just knock beside the sharpness down
just<00:05:37.879> just<00:05:38.270> a<00:05:38.360> hair<00:05:38.659> like<00:05:38.900> that<00:05:39.169> okay<00:05:39.620> and

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
just just a hair like that okay and

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.279 
just just a hair like that okay and
watch<00:05:40.460> what<00:05:40.729> happens<00:05:41.150> if<00:05:41.360> I<00:05:41.479> turn<00:05:41.539> the<00:05:42.139> effect

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:42.289 
watch what happens if I turn the effect

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:44.619 
watch what happens if I turn the effect
on<00:05:42.740> and<00:05:42.979> off<00:05:43.069> you<00:05:43.339> can<00:05:43.370> see<00:05:43.669> this<00:05:44.240> is<00:05:44.360> what<00:05:44.509> it

00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:44.629 
on and off you can see this is what it

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:46.029 
on and off you can see this is what it
looked<00:05:44.779> like<00:05:44.839> before<00:05:45.050> hand<00:05:45.500> that's<00:05:45.740> what<00:05:45.919> it

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:46.039 
looked like before hand that's what it

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:48.579 
looked like before hand that's what it
looked<00:05:46.189> like<00:05:46.250> afterward<00:05:46.879> okay<00:05:47.029> that<00:05:47.930> to<00:05:48.199> me<00:05:48.379> is

00:05:48.579 --> 00:05:48.589 
looked like afterward okay that to me is

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:50.260 
looked like afterward okay that to me is
somewhat<00:05:49.129> of<00:05:49.250> an<00:05:49.339> improvement<00:05:49.699> and<00:05:50.029> if<00:05:50.180> you

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
somewhat of an improvement and if you

somewhat of an improvement and if you
want<00:05:50.449> to<00:05:50.569> see<00:05:50.750> it<00:05:50.870> zoomed<00:05:51.110> in<00:05:51.319> and<00:05:51.469> out<00:05:51.589> you<00:05:52.129> can

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:52.159 
want to see it zoomed in and out you can

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:54.610 
want to see it zoomed in and out you can
hit<00:05:52.370> the<00:05:52.550> the<00:05:52.969> Z<00:05:53.210> key<00:05:53.479> or<00:05:53.719> the<00:05:53.750> space<00:05:54.110> key<00:05:54.379> and

you<00:05:54.949> can<00:05:54.979> see<00:05:55.370> the<00:05:55.819> difference<00:05:56.240> between

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
you can see the difference between

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.519 
you can see the difference between
