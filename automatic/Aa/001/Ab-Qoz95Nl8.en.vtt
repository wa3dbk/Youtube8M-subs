jumping jacks are great exercise for

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.660 
jumping jacks are great exercise for
kids<00:01:48.689> because<00:01:49.020> they're<00:01:49.200> working<00:01:49.320> on

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
kids because they're working on

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.889 
kids because they're working on
coordination<00:01:50.670> they<00:01:51.390> have<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.630> bring<00:01:51.780> their

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
coordination they have to bring their

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.420 
legs apart and together working on
balance<00:01:54.390> gives<00:01:55.320> some<00:01:55.530> cardio<00:01:55.890> too<00:01:55.979> because

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
balance gives some cardio too because

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.859 
balance gives some cardio too because
the<00:01:56.579> heart<00:01:56.759> rate<00:01:56.909> gets<00:01:57.090> up<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.479> think<00:01:57.750> the

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
the heart rate gets up I think the

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.719 
the heart rate gets up I think the
biggest<00:01:58.140> benefit<00:01:58.860> is<00:01:58.890> not<00:01:59.250> necessarily<00:01:59.610> the

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
biggest benefit is not necessarily the

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.190 
biggest benefit is not necessarily the
energy<00:02:00.180> expenditure<00:02:00.600> at<00:02:00.810> how<00:02:00.899> many<00:02:01.020> calories

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
energy expenditure at how many calories

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.600 
energy expenditure at how many calories
