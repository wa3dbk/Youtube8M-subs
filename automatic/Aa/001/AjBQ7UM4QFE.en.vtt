00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 hello again today I bring you chiles 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.560
 stuffed this is one of the things that 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.450
 Strange much of Guatemala 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.599
 stuffed chiles that we can get in 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.670
 any time of the year and they are delicious 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.920
 so today I share this recipe 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.830
 we started with a pound of polo I saw that or 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.930
 of beef skirt in Canada and in the USA 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.090
 they get as white is clear and the 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.099
 we cook with enough water two 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.050
 laurel leaves and salt 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.510
 if the thing and not already pressure the kitchen 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.399
 for 25 minutes or if that is not normal 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.440
 for about 40 minutes or until 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.840
 well smooth the meat once you're 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.260
 cooked and let it cool we're going to 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.780
 cut as thin as possible again 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.390
 we continue with the vegetables to this is the 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.350
 tip of a knife with baking 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.420
 this helps so that the vegetables 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.420
 keep their color and we're going to put 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.329
 cook half a pound of jos of chopped two 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.370
 potatoes and two carrots and I put them 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.530
 to sew before applying them because 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.059
 when they are already cooked in a lot is more 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.309
 easy to sting 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.140
 so when it's all ready we 're going 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.330
 to put in a pan 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.570
 two tablespoons of oil to heat 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.050
 we add two garlics and one half onion 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.330
 chopped 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.550
 We are going to fry all this 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.460
 a moment and we will add the 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.590
 meat that we have chopped can use 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.810
 a blender or a processor to be able 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.119
 chop the meat more easily equal 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.280
 vegetables we add a leaf of 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.130
 laurel and a slice of cinnamon 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.990
 all this we are going to stir well if not 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.020
 they get this meat they can use 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.869
 ground beef we also add two 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.720
 tomatoes let's let the tomatoes get 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.759
 cook well before mixing it with the 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.840
 rest of ingredients we season it with 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.130
 salt and pepper and consume we can 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.160
 crush them a little bit so that 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.979
 request your juices and now if we 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.500
 we stir everything immediately too 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.060
 We are going to add our vegetables that 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.040
 they are already well chopped 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.070
 how our vegetables are already cooked 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.170
 all we have to do is 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.479
 return them well with meat now it 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.940
 let's add a tablespoon of vinegar 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.220
 this was told to me that it serves to make 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.380
 keep chiles and 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.239
 apart it gives a special touch 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.970
 we reason well to our liking and what 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:21.430
 We reserve now in a comal or in a 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.459
 pan let's put to roast our 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.650
 chips I had two big chilies like that 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:30.640
 which are the ones that I'm going to use and we're going to 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.319
 do them well on both sides when 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.120
 are well roasted we put all in 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.400
 the center we add two tablespoons of 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.799
 we cover them and leave them cooking 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.709
 steamed with about 15 or 20 minutes 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:44.349
 after that time we passed them by 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.930
 cold water and if you see that they are 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:50.680
 sheds skin easily as well as 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.510
 this is that they are ready on the internet 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.150
 You can find other methods to 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.950
 to be able to remove the skin from the chiles but 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.260
 I like this one because I feel that 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.420
 is that they are roasted as it gives true 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.700
 Chilli flavor but good 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.830
 it is as you wish when you are 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.739
 ready we can start filling 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.290
 our chilies can make chiles 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:15.130
 whole or they can make them in half 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.980
 or they can make them with chili strips 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.770
 it really is to everyone's taste and 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.530
 let's put the filling we're going to 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:26.260
 add a little bit of bread crumb 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.630
 over and we are going to press them so that 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.640
 remain as compact as possible if 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.220
 you want hot peppers can 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.130
 make them with jalapeÃ±o peppers so 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.769
 we make all our chiles and now 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.080
 let's beat 4 eggs starting alone 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.660
 by the whites until they form peaks and 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.120
 then we are adding one to one the 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.940
 buds also to this we are going to add 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.060
 a spoonful of flour and mix it 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.970
 well and we are ready to cover 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.739
 our chips are going to put in a 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.880
 pan to heat 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.340
 enough oil 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.680
 and now we're going to start lining 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.570
 our chiles let's try not to 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.420
 we are too close together to make it 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:11.090
 easier to flip them over the pan 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.330
 put it on medium low heat so it does not 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.850
 they burn us easily and we turn them over 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.670
 carefully some take a weird shape 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.400
 like this one that looks like a little toad but not 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.830
 matter so we fry them well from 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.650
 both sides are drained on paper 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:31.100
 kitchen and they are ready we can 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.350
 enjoy as you see fit so 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.670
 I hope you enjoy this recipe and the 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.070
 do because the truth is that they are 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:39.280
 delicious until next time 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.280
 bye
