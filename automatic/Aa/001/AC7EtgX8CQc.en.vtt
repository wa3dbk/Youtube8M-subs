just<00:05:26.249> pick<00:05:26.459> so<00:05:26.729> i<00:05:26.759> would<00:05:26.969> say<00:05:27.119> xbox<00:05:27.599> and<00:05:27.959> then

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:28.739 
just pick so i would say xbox and then

00:05:28.739 --> 00:05:29.899 
just pick so i would say xbox and then
they<00:05:28.860> want<00:05:29.039> to<00:05:29.099> know<00:05:29.219> where<00:05:29.429> you<00:05:29.519> got<00:05:29.699> it<00:05:29.759> from

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:29.909 
they want to know where you got it from

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:34.009 
they want to know where you got it from
just<00:05:30.479> you<00:05:31.259> know<00:05:31.349> put<00:05:31.379> whatever<00:05:31.769> and<00:05:33.019> then

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:34.019 
just you know put whatever and then

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:36.859 
just you know put whatever and then
you're<00:05:34.169> going<00:05:34.259> to<00:05:34.319> enter<00:05:34.499> the<00:05:34.649> code<00:05:34.889> and<00:05:35.869> this

00:05:36.859 --> 00:05:36.869 
you're going to enter the code and this

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:38.479 
you're going to enter the code and this
step<00:05:37.110> here<00:05:37.319> is<00:05:37.379> already<00:05:37.589> after<00:05:37.979> you<00:05:38.069> signed<00:05:38.309> in

step here is already after you signed in
to<00:05:38.579> your<00:05:38.610> dr<00:05:38.999> pepper<00:05:39.179> account<00:05:39.569> which<00:05:39.809> is<00:05:39.959> step

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 
to your dr pepper account which is step

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:43.129 
to your dr pepper account which is step
two<00:05:40.579> so<00:05:41.579> step<00:05:41.939> one<00:05:42.119> is<00:05:42.239> pick<00:05:42.419> your<00:05:42.539> prize<00:05:42.689> step

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 
two so step one is pick your prize step

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:45.529 
two so step one is pick your prize step
to<00:05:43.349> sign<00:05:44.189> in<00:05:44.339> the<00:05:44.399> dr<00:05:44.699> pepper<00:05:44.729> step<00:05:45.269> three<00:05:45.509> you

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:45.539 
to sign in the dr pepper step three you

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:49.009 
to sign in the dr pepper step three you
put<00:05:45.779> in<00:05:45.899> the<00:05:45.989> code<00:05:46.610> step<00:05:47.610> 4<00:05:47.969> log<00:05:48.329> in<00:05:48.509> to<00:05:48.599> your<00:05:48.659> EA

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:49.019 
put in the code step 4 log in to your EA

00:05:49.019 --> 00:05:51.889 
put in the code step 4 log in to your EA
account<00:05:49.169> and<00:05:49.860> then<00:05:50.519> the<00:05:51.059> fifth<00:05:51.299> step<00:05:51.599> will<00:05:51.869> be
