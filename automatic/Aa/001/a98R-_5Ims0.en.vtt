00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.340 
hi I'm Holly ensel with Hoosier energy
and<00:00:06.270> today<00:00:06.540> I<00:00:06.569> would<00:00:06.720> like<00:00:06.839> to<00:00:07.020> talk<00:00:07.290> about

their ductwork historically Heating &amp;
Air<00:00:19.380> Conditioning<00:00:19.439> Contractors<00:00:19.890> would<00:00:20.699> take

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
Air Conditioning Contractors would take

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.700 
Air Conditioning Contractors would take
and<00:00:21.060> they<00:00:21.119> would<00:00:21.240> put<00:00:21.449> tape<00:00:21.660> around<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:22.320> seams

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
and they would put tape around the seams

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.099 
and they would put tape around the seams
on<00:00:22.949> duct<00:00:23.220> work<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.730> over<00:00:24.390> time

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
on duct work and over time

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.710 
on duct work and over time
the<00:00:25.410> adhesive<00:00:25.560> in<00:00:26.189> that<00:00:26.369> ductwork<00:00:26.730> would<00:00:27.420> dry

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
the adhesive in that ductwork would dry

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.540 
the adhesive in that ductwork would dry
out<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.170> take<00:00:28.439> would<00:00:28.650> actually<00:00:29.010> fall<00:00:29.279> off

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
out and take would actually fall off

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.580 
out and take would actually fall off
today<00:00:30.359> we've<00:00:30.539> got<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.720> product<00:00:31.050> that's<00:00:31.289> called

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
today we've got a product that's called

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.280 
today we've got a product that's called
mastic<00:00:32.250> then<00:00:32.969> we<00:00:33.090> can<00:00:33.270> put<00:00:33.450> on<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.690> seams<00:00:33.989> of

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
mastic then we can put on the seams of

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.229 
mastic then we can put on the seams of
ductwork<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:35.190> that<00:00:35.579> will<00:00:35.700> be<00:00:35.820> there<00:00:36.030> forever

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
ductwork that that will be there forever

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.130 
ductwork that that will be there forever
and<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.809> seals<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.260> almost<00:00:37.469> water<00:00:37.890> watertight

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
and it seals it almost water watertight

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.119 
and it seals it almost water watertight
you'll<00:00:40.140> notice<00:00:40.379> here<00:00:40.500> I've<00:00:40.590> got<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.770> piece<00:00:40.950> of

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
which we have returned flanges

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.150 
which we have returned flanges
underneath<00:00:54.780> here<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.020> hold<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.620> collar<00:00:55.829> to
