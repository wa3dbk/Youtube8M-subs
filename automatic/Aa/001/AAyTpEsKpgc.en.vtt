00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
this glitch to happen and be able to be

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.380 
this glitch to happen and be able to be
duplicated<00:02:26.160> now<00:02:26.340> when<00:02:26.489> you<00:02:26.519> spawn<00:02:26.940> you<00:02:27.150> should

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
duplicated now when you spawn you should

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.360 
duplicated now when you spawn you should
see<00:02:27.599> that<00:02:27.629> you<00:02:27.870> spawned<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:28.379> down<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.830> hill<00:02:29.099> or

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
see that you spawned it down the hill or

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.580 
see that you spawned it down the hill or
down<00:02:30.030> there<00:02:30.360> away<00:02:30.870> from<00:02:30.930> your<00:02:31.230> garage

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
down there away from your garage

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.470 
down there away from your garage
basically<00:02:32.220> this<00:02:32.430> is<00:02:32.670> perfect<00:02:33.090> if<00:02:33.150> we<00:02:33.239> find

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
basically this is perfect if we find

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.000 
basically this is perfect if we find
this<00:02:33.959> means<00:02:34.260> that<00:02:34.349> your<00:02:34.530> vehicle<00:02:34.920> is

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
this means that your vehicle is

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
duplicated correctly from here you can

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.920 
duplicated correctly from here you can
hop<00:02:38.489> out<00:02:38.610> your<00:02:38.819> vehicle<00:02:39.239> and<00:02:39.269> see<00:02:39.660> if<00:02:39.780> the

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
tracker has been removed from this

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.280 
tracker has been removed from this
vehicle<00:02:41.879> if<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.269> has<00:02:42.450> a<00:02:42.480> new<00:02:42.780> have<00:02:42.900> done<00:02:43.110> this

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
vehicle if it has a new have done this

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.800 
vehicle if it has a new have done this
glitch<00:02:43.799> correctly<00:02:44.489> from<00:02:45.090> here<00:02:45.390> you<00:02:45.540> can<00:02:45.569> then

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
glitch correctly from here you can then

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.870
