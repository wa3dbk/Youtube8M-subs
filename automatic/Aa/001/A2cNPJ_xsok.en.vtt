00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
5:30 or so because why not get up even

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.269 
5:30 or so because why not get up even
earlier<00:00:15.570> than<00:00:15.630> you<00:00:15.960> would<00:00:16.170> for<00:00:16.440> work<00:00:16.710> fishing

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
is the reason why see there's very

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.769 
is the reason why see there's very
little<00:00:19.410> actual<00:00:19.890> down<00:00:20.369> time<00:00:20.730> at<00:00:21.060> camp<00:00:21.359> because

little actual down time at camp because

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.750 
little actual down time at camp because
any<00:00:22.350> break<00:00:22.529> in<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.710> action<00:00:22.890> could<00:00:23.250> always<00:00:23.460> be

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
any break in the action could always be

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.700 
any break in the action could always be
filled<00:00:24.029> with<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.269> opportunity<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.199> reel<00:00:25.410> in<00:00:25.619> a

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
filled with the opportunity to reel in a

filled with the opportunity to reel in a
fish<00:00:26.010> this<00:00:26.699> could<00:00:27.090> just<00:00:27.330> mean<00:00:27.510> casting<00:00:27.990> off

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080
