00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.860 
cutting green backspacer Oh struggling
here<00:03:12.579> with<00:03:12.730> this<00:03:12.849> focus<00:03:13.419> it's<00:03:13.989> the<00:03:14.139> problem

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
here with this focus it's the problem

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.770 
here with this focus it's the problem
here<00:03:16.870> we<00:03:16.930> go

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.949 

so<00:03:22.410> let's<00:03:22.620> see<00:03:22.770> how<00:03:22.800> she<00:03:22.980> flips<00:03:23.370> now<00:03:24.090> it's<00:03:24.900> a

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
so let's see how she flips now it's a

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:31.040 
so let's see how she flips now it's a
well<00:03:25.140> known<00:03:26.240> mark<00:03:27.240> 6<00:03:27.510> is<00:03:27.660> always<00:03:28.020> flip<00:03:28.319> well<00:03:30.050> so

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
well known mark 6 is always flip well so

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.670 
well known mark 6 is always flip well so
there<00:03:31.230> you<00:03:31.260> go<00:03:31.350> in<00:03:31.709> the<00:03:31.890> actual<00:03:32.490> blade<00:03:33.680> and

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
there you go in the actual blade and

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.490 
there you go in the actual blade and
then<00:03:34.800> it's<00:03:34.920> also<00:03:35.220> a<00:03:35.459> moon<00:03:35.730> glow<00:03:36.060> in<00:03:36.390> the

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
then it's also a moon glow in the

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.309 
then it's also a moon glow in the
flipper<00:03:37.500> party<00:03:37.770> here<00:03:38.209> then<00:03:39.209> as<00:03:39.569> I<00:03:39.810> was<00:03:39.930> talking

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
flipper party here then as I was talking

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.710 
flipper party here then as I was talking
with<00:03:40.410> him<00:03:40.819> that<00:03:41.819> actually<00:03:42.150> asked<00:03:42.420> if<00:03:42.569> there's

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
with him that actually asked if there's

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.559 
with him that actually asked if there's
any<00:03:42.870> way<00:03:42.989> I<00:03:43.020> could<00:03:43.140> trade<00:03:43.530> out<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:44.360> scales<00:03:45.360> on

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
any way I could trade out the scales on

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.690 
any way I could trade out the scales on
it<00:03:45.660> because<00:03:45.780> I<00:03:45.870> had<00:03:46.020> Jade<00:03:46.319> on<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.560> other<00:03:46.800> mark

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
it because I had Jade on the other mark

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.280 
it because I had Jade on the other mark
6<00:03:47.940> that<00:03:48.090> I<00:03:48.120> bought<00:03:48.330> and<00:03:48.540> he's<00:03:48.690> you<00:03:49.080> know<00:03:49.110> he
