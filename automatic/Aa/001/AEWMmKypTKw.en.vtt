inside<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:39.000> cube<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.410> exactly<00:00:40.860> as<00:00:41.340> the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
inside the cube it is exactly as the

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.290 
inside the cube it is exactly as the
pictures<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:41.969> have<00:00:42.000> seen<00:00:43.219> very<00:00:44.219> long<00:00:44.640> pieces

pictures you have seen very long pieces

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.600 
pictures you have seen very long pieces
I<00:00:45.899> would<00:00:46.230> say<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.800> zhanchi<00:00:47.039> would<00:00:47.460> only

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
I would say that the zhanchi would only

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.459 
I would say that the zhanchi would only
come<00:00:47.820> up<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.090> about<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.480> top<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.840> my<00:00:48.930> pinky<00:00:49.200> at

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
come up to about the top of my pinky at

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.569 
come up to about the top of my pinky at
this<00:00:49.680> point<00:00:50.059> the<00:00:51.059> corner<00:00:51.510> very<00:00:52.399> similar<00:00:53.399> to

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
this point the corner very similar to

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.889 
this point the corner very similar to
the<00:00:53.730> zhanchi<00:00:54.860> the<00:00:55.860> pieces<00:00:56.280> in<00:00:56.399> this<00:00:56.520> cube<00:00:56.899> fit

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
the zhanchi the pieces in this cube fit

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.400 
the zhanchi the pieces in this cube fit
together<00:00:58.260> very<00:00:58.559> tightly<00:00:59.870> that's<00:01:00.870> part<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.320> the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
together very tightly that's part of the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.979 
together very tightly that's part of the
reason<00:01:01.530> why<00:01:01.739> they<00:01:02.100> call<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.809> solid<00:01:03.809> like<00:01:03.960> a

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
reason why they call it solid like a

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.250 
reason why they call it solid like a
rock<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.619> know<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.920> panchi<00:01:05.460> very<00:01:05.939> low<00:01:06.900> and

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
rock you know the panchi very low and

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.210 
rock you know the panchi very low and
tight<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.799> ground<00:01:08.040> kind<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.520> mentality

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
tight to the ground kind of mentality

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.530 
tight to the ground kind of mentality
figured<00:01:11.220> i<00:01:11.460> would<00:01:11.700> give<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:11.880> guys<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.119> quick

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
figured i would give you guys a quick

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.060 
figured i would give you guys a quick

actually isn't my favorite uh it has

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.550 
actually isn't my favorite uh it has
some<00:01:51.840> great<00:01:52.049> cutting<00:01:52.409> great<00:01:53.369> feel<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.560> but

way this cube out and pretty clicky but

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.780 
way this cube out and pretty clicky but
it<00:02:33.090> feels<00:02:33.360> really<00:02:33.920> solid<00:02:34.920> in<00:02:35.220> your<00:02:35.370> hands<00:02:35.700> it's

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.170 
bind up at all um I'm sure that somebody
at<00:02:42.480> some<00:02:42.810> point<00:02:43.080> you<00:02:43.920> know<00:02:44.040> we'll<00:02:44.730> figure<00:02:44.970> out

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
at some point you know we'll figure out

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.160 
at some point you know we'll figure out
a<00:02:45.300> way<00:02:45.600> to<00:02:45.660> mod<00:02:45.989> it<00:02:46.019> so<00:02:46.440> that<00:02:46.650> it'll<00:02:46.800> be<00:02:47.959> just<00:02:48.959> as

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
a way to mod it so that it'll be just as

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.500 
a way to mod it so that it'll be just as
great<00:02:49.350> or<00:02:49.620> better<00:02:49.890> than<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.250> zhanchi<00:02:50.489> and<00:02:51.090> i

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
great or better than the zhanchi and i

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.120 
great or better than the zhanchi and i
would<00:02:51.720> like<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:52.050> figure<00:02:52.230> out<00:02:52.410> some<00:02:52.620> mods<00:02:52.830> for

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
would like to figure out some mods for

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.890 
would like to figure out some mods for
it<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.820> more<00:02:54.030> I'm<00:02:54.150> playing<00:02:54.420> with<00:02:54.630> it<00:02:54.780> the

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
it the more I'm playing with it the

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.560 
it the more I'm playing with it the
better<00:02:55.050> it's<00:02:55.290> getting<00:02:55.500> but<00:02:55.920> it's<00:02:56.070> a<00:02:56.540> overall<00:02:57.540> a

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
better it's getting but it's a overall a

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.979 
better it's getting but it's a overall a
good<00:02:57.780> cube<00:02:58.310> definitely<00:02:59.310> worth<00:02:59.430> checking<00:02:59.489> out

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
good cube definitely worth checking out

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.850 
good cube definitely worth checking out
any<00:03:00.989> classf<00:03:01.500> astana<00:03:02.040> nope<00:03:03.380> this<00:03:04.380> is<00:03:04.470> ben<00:03:04.709> with

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
any classf astana nope this is ben with

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.790 
any classf astana nope this is ben with
