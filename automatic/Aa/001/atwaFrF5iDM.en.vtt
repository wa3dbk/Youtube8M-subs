00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:18.260
 It 's time to play bass and corn on a chromatic harmonica 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.690
 The sound may be clogged up or the back pitch may be low 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.050
 This is right 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:27.590
 It is in the mouth when you play less than half 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:33.610
 It's nice that I can't make space for each sound 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:37.280
 I'm there is a need to greatly expand the throat, for example, say that when you loan a certain playing 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.020
 Even if this is not done, it will not be firm 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.079
 For example 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.050
 Second 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.990
 It says I Na Toka sambar 7 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.850
 It is hard to get along 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.590
 Here in purposely and desired condition 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.030
 In the state 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.400
 I want to make a sound 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.670
 Ah ah ah 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.670
 Ha 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:07.360
 I got stuck in a little bit 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.360
 I wonder of it after the third Bitch I think also in that gone down considerably 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.940
 4 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:18.880
 The sound of this sounds beautiful when you spread the node and blow it 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:23.220
 Oh 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:26.450
 It is the second sound Hmmm 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.450
 The third one 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.720
 Oh 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.550
 In this way we have become firmly Wow 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.890
 It is the same as in kelp 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.900
 Depending on the sound 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:53.260
 There is a place where the sound is not pronounced beautifully without blowing 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:59.370
 For example, the spirit of 9 burners 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:59.370
 Noodles is kinda I would like to I-blown way not there on purpose 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:15.160
 Occasionally there is a bit of a spiritual sound, but a metallic sound I'm going to go together 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:19.930
 The sound you see in 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:24.200
 The position of the tongue and the condition in the mouth are very important. 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:29.030
 It is various, but try it for yourself 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.700
 There is a point that is a tower of vows , so I would like to have that space rejected 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.830
 I will 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.050
 To 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.050
 It will be sensible if it will be in the state that can make the sound sound well 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:54.770
 Like this, it is good to be called harmonica 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:03:00.380
 Because it is necessary to say how to blow according to each sound 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:02.840
 I have a lot of practice and I would like to find out how to blow it 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:07.120
 You will get used to it 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:10.860
 Because you can do the key that matches each sound instantly 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.860
 Please do your best for your annual income
