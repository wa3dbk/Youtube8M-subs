00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
this is a photo of volcanic lightning it

ritzy<00:00:04.710> and<00:00:05.009> it<00:00:05.100> prompted<00:00:05.460> us<00:00:05.580> to<00:00:05.700> ask<00:00:05.879> how<00:00:06.270> the

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
ritzy and it prompted us to ask how the

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.940 
ritzy and it prompted us to ask how the
heck<00:00:06.600> does<00:00:06.810> lightning<00:00:07.170> happen<00:00:12.769> hey<00:00:13.769> guys

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
heck does lightning happen hey guys

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
lightning what the heck

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.540 
lightning what the heck
magma<00:00:23.699> explosions<00:00:24.689> heat<00:00:25.019> lava<00:00:25.550> explosions

again<00:00:26.849> lightning<00:00:27.570> you're<00:00:27.810> getting<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.050> little

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
again lightning you're getting a little

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.660 
again lightning you're getting a little
melodramatic<00:00:28.349> there<00:00:28.890> mother<00:00:29.099> nature<00:00:29.429> with

what<00:00:38.399> causes<00:00:38.640> lightning<00:00:39.120> are<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.510> positive

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
what causes lightning are you positive

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:43.190 
what causes lightning are you positive
no<00:00:41.969> but<00:00:42.180> really<00:00:42.300> are<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.780> positive

are<00:00:47.489> pretty<00:00:47.670> sure<00:00:47.940> lightning<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.480> thunder

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
are pretty sure lightning and thunder

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.910 
are pretty sure lightning and thunder
clouds<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.200> caused<00:00:49.350> by<00:00:49.530> something<00:00:49.770> called

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
clouds is caused by something called

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.700 
clouds is caused by something called
charge<00:00:50.960> separation<00:00:51.960> hopefully<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.559> already

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
charge separation hopefully you already

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.439 
charge separation hopefully you already
understand<00:00:53.250> what<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.460> water<00:00:53.699> cycle<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.270> you

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
understand what the water cycle is you

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.150 
understand what the water cycle is you
know<00:00:54.570> water<00:00:54.899> evaporates<00:00:55.530> out<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.800> lakes<00:00:55.949> and

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
know water evaporates out of lakes and

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.350 
know water evaporates out of lakes and
streams<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.550> rivers<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.940> whatever<00:00:57.090> and

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
streams and rivers and whatever and

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.150 
streams and rivers and whatever and
condenses<00:00:57.960> into<00:00:58.170> clouds<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.800> then<00:00:58.949> rains

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
condenses into clouds and then rains

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.069 
condenses into clouds and then rains
back<00:00:59.430> onto<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.879> surface<00:01:00.030> again<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.870> water

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
back onto the surface again the water

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.750 
back onto the surface again the water
cycle<00:01:01.350> clouds<00:01:01.829> are<00:01:01.980> just<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.250> collection<00:01:02.370> of
