I'm going to make a lot of use out of
them<00:04:15.670> these<00:04:16.479> will<00:04:16.630> really<00:04:16.780> lift<00:04:17.080> the<00:04:17.140> vehicle

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
them these will really lift the vehicle

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.240 
them these will really lift the vehicle
very<00:04:17.769> high<00:04:18.010> they<00:04:18.669> got<00:04:18.820> a<00:04:18.850> the<00:04:19.239> 6-ton<00:04:19.750> model<00:04:20.250> the

I don't you know I think I got two pairs
to<00:04:46.180> lift<00:04:46.389> the<00:04:46.449> whole<00:04:46.570> vehicle<00:04:46.870> up<00:04:47.169> but<00:04:48.130> you

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
to lift the whole vehicle up but you

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.189 
to lift the whole vehicle up but you
know<00:04:48.340> even<00:04:48.610> if<00:04:48.850> you<00:04:48.940> got<00:04:49.090> the<00:04:49.240> three<00:04:49.479> ton<00:04:49.750> model

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 
know even if you got the three ton model

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:53.219 
know even if you got the three ton model
they're<00:04:50.440> significantly<00:04:51.250> less<00:04:51.580> money<00:04:52.229> and

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:53.229 
they're significantly less money and

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:56.850 
they're significantly less money and
that's<00:04:53.410> three<00:04:53.680> tons<00:04:53.949> each<00:04:54.190> and<00:04:54.550> I<00:04:55.410> think<00:04:56.410> I'm

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
that's three tons each and I think I'm

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.100 
that's three tons each and I think I'm
going<00:04:57.040> to<00:04:57.100> tell<00:04:57.250> you<00:04:57.340> another<00:04:57.490> thing<00:04:58.080> well<00:04:59.080> you

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.390 
didn't want to even mention on his video
but<00:05:01.389> I<00:05:01.450> was<00:05:01.570> looking<00:05:01.780> at<00:05:01.870> Heinz<00:05:02.110> Warner<00:05:02.590> and<00:05:02.770> I

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
but I was looking at Heinz Warner and I

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.270 
but I was looking at Heinz Warner and I
got<00:05:04.270> the<00:05:04.419> key<00:05:04.600> freeze<00:05:05.020> out<00:05:05.290> there<00:05:05.320> from<00:05:05.860> them<00:05:06.070> I
