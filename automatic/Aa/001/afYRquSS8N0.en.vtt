00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
the think digit

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.510 
the think digit
apart<00:00:19.290> from<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.560> screen<00:00:19.920> there<00:00:20.250> are<00:00:20.340> also

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
apart from the screen there are also

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.310 
apart from the screen there are also
other<00:00:20.970> hardware<00:00:21.540> improvements<00:00:21.660> that<00:00:22.260> have

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:34.830 
however have been bumped up to quad core

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.430 
however have been bumped up to quad core
which<00:00:35.400> is<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:36.090> course<00:00:36.120> for<00:00:36.629> supporting<00:00:37.199> the

are taken almost instantly this is a

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:44.330 
are taken almost instantly this is a
first<00:01:34.140> look<00:01:34.350> at<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.679> new<00:01:34.710> iPad<00:01:42.799> the<00:01:43.799> new<00:01:43.950> iPad

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
first look at the new iPad the new iPad

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.669 
first look at the new iPad the new iPad
feels<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.909> lot<00:01:45.119> heavier<00:01:45.420> than<00:01:45.780> its<00:01:45.990> predecessor

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
feels a lot heavier than its predecessor

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:53.540 
feels a lot heavier than its predecessor
but<00:01:46.950> looks<00:01:47.249> absolutely<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:48.179> same

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.090 

and<00:01:54.550> now<00:01:54.850> it<00:01:55.180> it<00:01:56.110> doesn't<00:01:56.350> recognize<00:01:56.920> the

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
and now it it doesn't recognize the

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.970 
and now it it doesn't recognize the
voice<00:01:57.250> properly<00:01:57.700> at<00:01:58.150> all<00:01:58.450> it<00:01:58.630> makes<00:01:58.840> it<00:01:59.080> you

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
voice properly at all it makes it you

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.740 
voice properly at all it makes it you
still<00:02:00.250> have<00:02:00.460> to<00:02:00.580> put<00:02:00.730> on<00:02:00.880> an<00:02:01.000> accent<00:02:01.480> to<00:02:01.600> get

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
still have to put on an accent to get

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.540 
still have to put on an accent to get
most<00:02:01.990> of<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.290> words<00:02:02.440> right<00:02:02.770> and<00:02:03.010> still<00:02:03.400> you

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
most of the words right and still you

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:04.920 
most of the words right and still you
will<00:02:03.700> end<00:02:03.880> up<00:02:03.970> with<00:02:04.030> a<00:02:04.150> few<00:02:04.300> mistakes<00:02:04.510> in<00:02:04.840> the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
will end up with a few mistakes in the

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.710 
will end up with a few mistakes in the

and<00:02:10.330> revolutionary<00:02:10.959> device<00:02:11.260> especially<00:02:11.650> when

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
and revolutionary device especially when

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.890 
and revolutionary device especially when
it<00:02:12.220> comes<00:02:12.370> to<00:02:12.550> the<00:02:12.730> display<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.390> power<00:02:13.660> under

the<00:02:14.020> hood<00:02:14.110> has<00:02:14.530> been<00:02:14.770> improved<00:02:15.430> and

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
the hood has been improved and

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.720 
the hood has been improved and
everything<00:02:16.390> feels<00:02:16.630> smooth<00:02:17.320> as<00:02:17.470> silk<00:02:17.709> the<00:02:18.459> only

everything feels smooth as silk the only

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.610 
everything feels smooth as silk the only
disadvantage<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.510> new<00:02:19.660> iPad<00:02:20.110> is<00:02:20.290> that<00:02:20.470> it's

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
disadvantage the new iPad is that it's

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.230 
disadvantage the new iPad is that it's
likely<00:02:20.890> heavier<00:02:21.340> than<00:02:21.459> its<00:02:21.610> predecessor<00:02:22.090> and
