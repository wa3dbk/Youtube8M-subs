00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.770
 We introduce this time 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.630
 However, it is not hanging 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.630
 17 o'clock by material 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.320
 I did each instrument in this way 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.510
 It will be a match that is putting on a sap stimulant 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.640
 It expanded similarly in the month 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.360
 I hope that you won't be good at coding Goto 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.360
 One of 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.510
 Film festival 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.960
 There is also this 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.960
 In this way 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.090
 Senajima cuisine is 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.090
 Just done 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.840
 Before 6 pm 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.710
 Do not decide how to decide 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.700
 The liberalization of ASCII has begun 20 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.730
 In the next 20 years 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.730
 It seems that the business has changed 180 degrees 

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.059
 In the past lack of experience 

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:14.649
 Give advice 

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:17.529
 The other side is also in charge 

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:20.529
 Extending the point of doing sales 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:24.039
 It will be difficult 

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:27.299
 At the seminar, we will think about the way of house acquisition so far 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:27.769
 did 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.769
 We will propose a review of the process 

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:36.609
 Even if you win a house, you have a financial plan to stabilize your life 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.609
 Secure 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:03.459
 I want to go out 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.219
 I want a free protest 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:09.669
 The feeling of having created 1000 jobs on that 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:11.369
 If you can 

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:14.369
 Solid thing 

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:20.529
 Even if I was told that part of it firmly 

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:21.989
 Average age 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.989
 It was hard to adapt the merits strongly 

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:29.429
 But thanks to you already being asked for Yokocho 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.969
 After all I can not go one step further 

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:36.969
 Customers are almost set 

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:45.679
