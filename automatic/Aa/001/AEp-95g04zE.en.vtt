00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.600
 today we will prepare a peach cake 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:14.889
 following with our recipe section 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:17.380
 healthy today we prepare a dessert very 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.970
 juicy and that is very tasty is a dessert 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.340
 very light we will do with cookies 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.790
 whole milk semi-skimmed and very 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.790
 little sugar 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.500
 these are the ingredients that we are going to 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.690
 use having the full list at 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.610
 end of the video on the website 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.990
 we start with cookies like you 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.900
 commented at the beginning we will use 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.220
 whole grain cookies digestive types 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.500
 we need to crush them, we'll do it with 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.720
 grinder or simpler we put them in 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.450
 a bag closed and with the help of a 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.730
 roll or bottle we crush them already 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.590
 you see like this would be perfectly now 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.090
 we continue with the buttons we are 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.309
 using I liked it in syrup 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.950
 we will use a big boat of 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.950
 those weighing about 850 grams we drain 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.210
 well the syrup and chop 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.040
 we will use a peach half to 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.320
 make the decoration we will cut you in 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.090
 finite sheets and we reserve 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.640
 to demold the best we will use 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.350
 baking paper we wet the surface 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.710
 so that it sticks to us what 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.710
 we adjust 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.150
 following to start with the try that 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.360
 we put to preheat the oven to 170 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.360
 degrees 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.049
 and we go there on a flight we take four 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.259
 eggs and beat them lightly with the 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:31.259
 rods 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.740
 then we add age camarena and 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.479
 we mix 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.729
 Brown sugar is healthier than 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.740
 normal sugar and will bring a color and 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.890
 flavor of toast that looks great 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.890
 this 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.980
 for the following add the milk in 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.830
 this case we use semi-skimmed milk 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.910
 you can do it with skimmed too what 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.950
 ideal is that the gap is at 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.840
 room temperature like this if 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.460
 it does not heal before 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.460
 and finally we add the cookies 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.090
 and the yeast about 16 grams 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.400
 we mix until it is integrated and 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.400
 we have our mix ready 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.980
 we already have the street is mixed now 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.390
 we add that peach 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.989
 we give a couple of laps to 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.989
 incorporate it 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.310
 and we put it in the mold 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.750
 and now we go to the oven 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.800
 and now we refuse 170 degrees during 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.800
 about 50 minutes 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.350
 once the 50 minutes have passed 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.720
 we click in the middle to see how it goes 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.980
 our cake if the skewer comes out clean 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.170
 it means that we already have the cake 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.970
 prepared and we can remove it in case 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.310
 otherwise we would leave 5 more minutes 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.290
 well here we have it fixed that you paint 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.400
 is now we will let it rest in the 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.989
 mold about 5 or 10 minutes more 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.030
 and once it has tempered we unmold 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.519
 you see that with paper it's super easy 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:40.110
 we place it on a grid and 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:41.970
 remove the paper leaving it to cool 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.120
 and cooled down today I want to show you how it has 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.120
 left 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:52.480
 notice how juicy 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.580
 terrific is a cake is for 8-10 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.160
 rations 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.270
 it's very juicy and light we'll have the 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.190
 figures that give us cookies 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.770
 whole milk calcium 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:06.440
 semi-skimmed and vitamin C from 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:09.260
 peaches that you can ask for more 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.250

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.250
