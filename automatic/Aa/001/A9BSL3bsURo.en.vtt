it's a good idea to be able to block the

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:42.179 
it's a good idea to be able to block the
door<00:01:39.520> off<00:01:39.899> so<00:01:40.899> i<00:01:40.929> made<00:01:41.409> a<00:01:41.439> piece<00:01:41.649> of<00:01:41.679> wood<00:01:41.889> there

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
door off so i made a piece of wood there

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:44.789 
door off so i made a piece of wood there
and<00:01:43.060> if<00:01:43.569> you<00:01:43.689> just<00:01:43.899> want<00:01:44.049> to<00:01:44.079> block<00:01:44.289> a<00:01:44.319> part<00:01:44.679> way

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
and if you just want to block a part way

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.349 
and if you just want to block a part way
off<00:01:44.979> and<00:01:45.279> give<00:01:45.399> the<00:01:45.549> bees<00:01:45.669> a<00:01:45.700> little<00:01:46.029> space<00:01:46.329> to

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:46.359 
off and give the bees a little space to

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:48.690 
off and give the bees a little space to
get<00:01:46.659> in<00:01:46.779> then<00:01:47.649> you<00:01:47.770> can<00:01:47.889> just<00:01:48.009> do<00:01:48.159> that<00:01:48.310> or<00:01:48.669> you

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
get in then you can just do that or you

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.069 
get in then you can just do that or you
can<00:01:48.849> give<00:01:48.969> them<00:01:48.999> more<00:01:49.179> space<00:01:49.419> or<00:01:49.689> you<00:01:49.810> can<00:01:49.869> list

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 
can give them more space or you can list

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:55.679 
can give them more space or you can list
let<00:01:50.289> them<00:01:50.380> go<00:01:50.560> nuts<00:01:53.279> so<00:01:54.279> all<00:01:54.729> these<00:01:54.969> go<00:01:55.509> on

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
let them go nuts so all these go on

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:58.289 
let them go nuts so all these go on
there<00:01:55.959> that's<00:01:56.349> what<00:01:56.499> these<00:01:56.649> are<00:01:56.889> and<00:01:57.299> they

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299
