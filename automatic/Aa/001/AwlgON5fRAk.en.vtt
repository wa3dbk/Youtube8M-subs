in this episode I would like to explain
pinguicula<00:00:10.139> which<00:00:11.070> is<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.670> spot<00:00:12.450> on<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.870> side

pinguicula which is a spot on the side

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.070 
pinguicula which is a spot on the side
of<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.410> eye<00:00:13.440> there's<00:00:14.160> usually<00:00:14.460> caused<00:00:14.910> by<00:00:15.080> UV

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
of the eye there's usually caused by UV

of the eye there's usually caused by UV
light<00:00:16.109> exposure<00:00:17.240> many<00:00:18.240> people<00:00:18.570> can<00:00:18.810> notice

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
light exposure many people can notice

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.490 
light exposure many people can notice
this<00:00:19.350> as<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.650> yellowish<00:00:20.640> or<00:00:20.939> yellow<00:00:21.779> brown<00:00:22.170> type

the right which is the conjunctiva so as
you<00:00:29.400> may<00:00:29.550> remember<00:00:29.880> from<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:31.109> eye<00:00:31.140> model<00:00:31.500> the

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
you may remember from the eye model the

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.060 
you may remember from the eye model the
conjunctiva<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.510> thin<00:00:33.780> skin<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.710> covers

conjunctiva is the thin skin that covers

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.400 
conjunctiva is the thin skin that covers
over<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.399> surface<00:00:35.850> of<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.149> eye<00:00:36.200> on<00:00:37.200> this

we<00:01:39.869> may<00:01:40.110> use<00:01:40.439> drops<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.729> help<00:01:41.909> make<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.210> eye

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
we may use drops to help make the eye

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.480 
we may use drops to help make the eye
more<00:01:42.540> comfortable<00:01:43.079> including<00:01:43.950> artificial

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
more comfortable including artificial

tear drops or potentially steroid drops
if<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.640> really<00:01:47.909> needs<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.560> but<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.740> lot<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.100> times

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
if it really needs it but a lot of times

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.160 
if it really needs it but a lot of times
we<00:01:50.520> can<00:01:50.700> just<00:01:50.880> get<00:01:51.060> this<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.270> settle<00:01:51.720> down<00:01:51.869> on

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
we can just get this to settle down on

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.270 
we can just get this to settle down on
its<00:01:52.470> own<00:01:53.390> we<00:01:54.390> think<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.869> probably<00:01:55.079> this<00:01:55.979> is

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
its own we think that probably this is

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.249 
its own we think that probably this is
related<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:58.790> precursor<00:01:59.790> or<00:02:00.210> an<00:02:00.570> early<00:02:00.960> form

of the time in most situations we don't

of the time in most situations we don't
do<00:03:00.299> this<00:03:00.650> because<00:03:01.650> we<00:03:02.130> have<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.310> think<00:03:02.340> about

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
do this because we have to think about

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.390 
do this because we have to think about
the<00:03:03.480> risks<00:03:03.930> from<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.290> procedure<00:03:04.769> although

the risks from the procedure although
they<00:03:05.700> are<00:03:05.760> small<00:03:06.090> they're<00:03:06.330> never<00:03:06.540> zero<00:03:06.900> and

they are small they're never zero and

they are small they're never zero and
the<00:03:08.910> benefits<00:03:09.390> that<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.630> patient<00:03:09.989> stands<00:03:10.290> to

the benefits that the patient stands to
