 exactly 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.299
 on the maps that to your deactivates a 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:14.540
 vehicle and then it will give you 40 points 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:16.380

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.740
 case maps 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.320

 of the laser very well 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:31.799
 that this is something similar to halo 3 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.890

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.920
 a delivery at the top rate 11 and you kill with 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.720
 another point and already in example 3 it will be 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.030
