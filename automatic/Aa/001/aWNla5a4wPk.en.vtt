could if you do know why you could flip
the<00:03:53.540> Lynx<00:03:53.780> let<00:03:53.900> me<00:03:53.989> know<00:03:54.110> I<00:03:54.290> think<00:03:55.220> you<00:03:55.430> could

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
the Lynx let me know I think you could

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.070 
the Lynx let me know I think you could
play<00:03:55.700> two<00:03:55.820> player<00:03:56.180> games<00:03:56.450> and<00:03:56.630> then<00:03:56.780> one<00:03:56.989> of

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
play two player games and then one of

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.180 
play two player games and then one of
the<00:03:57.200> players<00:03:57.410> would<00:03:57.620> be<00:03:57.769> sitting<00:03:57.950> on<00:03:58.070> the

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
the players would be sitting on the

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.020 
the players would be sitting on the
other<00:03:58.220> side<00:03:58.549> and<00:03:58.850> you<00:03:59.480> just<00:03:59.720> flip<00:03:59.989> it<00:04:00.019> without

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
other side and you just flip it without

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.470 
other side and you just flip it without
having<00:04:02.030> to<00:04:02.120> flip<00:04:02.299> the<00:04:02.420> Lynx<00:04:02.690> I<00:04:02.780> think<00:04:04.090> and<00:04:05.090> that

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
having to flip the Lynx I think and that

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.850 
having to flip the Lynx I think and that
was<00:04:05.600> a<00:04:05.630> kiss<00:04:05.870> here<00:04:05.989> we<00:04:06.110> start<00:04:06.350> again<00:04:06.560> but<00:04:06.680> then

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
was a kiss here we start again but then

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.310 
was a kiss here we start again but then
in<00:04:07.070> French<00:04:07.519> so<00:04:08.090> that<00:04:08.120> was<00:04:08.480> the<00:04:08.660> manual<00:04:09.170> let's

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
in French so that was the manual let's

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.830 
in French so that was the manual let's
get<00:04:09.530> to<00:04:09.680> the<00:04:09.830> contents<00:04:10.670> of<00:04:10.730> the<00:04:10.850> box<00:04:11.030> as<00:04:11.630> you

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
get to the contents of the box as you

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.180 
get to the contents of the box as you
can<00:04:11.959> see<00:04:12.110> there<00:04:12.260> are<00:04:12.380> some<00:04:12.560> holes<00:04:12.860> in<00:04:13.070> the

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
can see there are some holes in the

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.490 
can see there are some holes in the
cardboard<00:04:13.489> and<00:04:13.880> debt<00:04:14.120> is<00:04:14.330> because<00:04:14.930> the<00:04:15.230> power

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
cardboard and debt is because the power

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.370 
cardboard and debt is because the power
adapter<00:04:16.040> does<00:04:16.280> not<00:04:16.430> fit<00:04:16.669> in<00:04:16.790> the<00:04:16.880> box<00:04:17.150> and<00:04:17.390> the

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
adapter does not fit in the box and the

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.409 
adapter does not fit in the box and the
previous<00:04:18.799> owner<00:04:19.010> just<00:04:19.340> pressed<00:04:19.700> the<00:04:19.910> lid<00:04:20.090> down

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
previous owner just pressed the lid down

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.589 
previous owner just pressed the lid down
and<00:04:20.690> created<00:04:21.350> some<00:04:21.530> holes<00:04:21.769> for<00:04:21.950> the<00:04:22.599> outlets

00:04:23.589 --> 00:04:23.599 
and created some holes for the outlets

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:26.230 
and created some holes for the outlets
so<00:04:24.349> that's<00:04:24.560> a<00:04:24.650> bit<00:04:24.830> sad<00:04:25.070> so<00:04:25.760> here's<00:04:26.000> the

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
so that's a bit sad so here's the

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.550 
so that's a bit sad so here's the
adapter

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
adapter

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.620 
adapter
power<00:04:27.740> adapter<00:04:28.310> power<00:04:28.760> plug<00:04:29.240> whatever<00:04:29.450> you

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
power adapter power plug whatever you

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.470 
power adapter power plug whatever you
want<00:04:29.750> to<00:04:29.810> call<00:04:29.960> it<00:04:30.190> um<00:04:31.190> I'm<00:04:31.820> not<00:04:32.000> sure<00:04:32.060> if<00:04:32.330> this

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
want to call it um I'm not sure if this

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.030 
want to call it um I'm not sure if this
came<00:04:32.840> with<00:04:33.050> the<00:04:33.139> set<00:04:33.350> I<00:04:33.410> don't<00:04:33.710> think<00:04:33.919> it<00:04:34.010> is

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
came with the set I don't think it is

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.560 
came with the set I don't think it is
but<00:04:34.280> it's<00:04:34.430> a<00:04:34.639> jack<00:04:35.419> block<00:04:36.700> yeah<00:04:37.700> one<00:04:38.210> makes<00:04:38.480> two

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
but it's a jack block yeah one makes two

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.710 
but it's a jack block yeah one makes two
so<00:04:39.470> it's<00:04:39.620> a<00:04:39.710> splitter<00:04:40.300> not<00:04:41.300> sure<00:04:41.480> where<00:04:41.690> that

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
so it's a splitter not sure where that

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.200 
so it's a splitter not sure where that
sing<00:04:42.110> there<00:04:42.370> and<00:04:43.370> then<00:04:43.490> we<00:04:43.580> have<00:04:43.730> the<00:04:43.910> Lynx

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
sing there and then we have the Lynx

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.990 
sing there and then we have the Lynx
itself<00:04:47.169> so<00:04:48.169> this<00:04:48.530> is<00:04:48.740> the<00:04:48.860> Beast<00:04:49.070> upside<00:04:49.700> down

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
itself so this is the Beast upside down

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.190 
itself so this is the Beast upside down
it's<00:04:50.960> quite<00:04:51.250> heavy<00:04:52.250> and<00:04:52.610> big<00:04:53.480> compared<00:04:54.080> to<00:04:54.139> a

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
it's quite heavy and big compared to a

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.200 
it's quite heavy and big compared to a
Game<00:04:54.440> Boy<00:04:54.470> let<00:04:54.740> me<00:04:54.800> take<00:04:55.010> a<00:04:55.040> game<00:04:55.280> morir<00:04:55.639> it's

Game Boy let me take a game morir it's

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.480 
Game Boy let me take a game morir it's
an<00:04:56.300> ugly<00:04:56.419> model<00:04:56.840> but<00:04:56.990> as<00:04:57.919> you<00:04:58.070> can<00:04:58.160> see<00:04:58.220> it's

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
an ugly model but as you can see it's

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.310 
an ugly model but as you can see it's
almost<00:04:58.610> twice<00:04:59.030> as<00:04:59.060> big<00:04:59.419> and<00:04:59.600> this<00:04:59.690> is<00:04:59.840> the<00:04:59.960> slim

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
almost twice as big and this is the slim

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.900 
almost twice as big and this is the slim
model<00:05:00.680> of<00:05:00.919> Lynx<00:05:01.840> the<00:05:02.840> hand<00:05:03.350> placement<00:05:03.650> here<00:05:04.550> is

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
model of Lynx the hand placement here is

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.360 
model of Lynx the hand placement here is
in<00:05:05.630> my<00:05:05.660> opinion<00:05:05.840> a<00:05:06.200> lot<00:05:06.500> more<00:05:06.770> natural<00:05:07.220> than

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
in my opinion a lot more natural than

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.219 
in my opinion a lot more natural than
than<00:05:07.729> this<00:05:07.970> because<00:05:08.180> I'm<00:05:08.330> covering<00:05:08.870> it<00:05:09.050> all

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:09.229 
than this because I'm covering it all

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:11.770 
than this because I'm covering it all
with<00:05:09.440> my<00:05:09.590> hand<00:05:09.940> but<00:05:10.940> that's<00:05:11.180> probably<00:05:11.600> because

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
with my hand but that's probably because

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.420 
with my hand but that's probably because
I<00:05:11.960> grew<00:05:12.229> up<00:05:12.260> with<00:05:12.530> the<00:05:12.620> Game<00:05:12.770> Boy<00:05:12.800> like<00:05:13.100> I<00:05:13.220> said
