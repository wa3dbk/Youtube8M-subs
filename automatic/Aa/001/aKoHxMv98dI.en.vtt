00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 Hello everyone, I greet you 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.880
 school blogger today i keep my 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.790
 sharing secrets of video blogging 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.570
 talk today sounds sound friends this 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.490
 the most important thing you shoot 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.270
 You may think that the most important camera 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.449
 most important of all there is no light the most important is 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.340
 good sound and google experts 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.730
 conducted a study and it turned out that 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.870
 people prefer to watch videos 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.000
 Poor quality but with good sound than 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.550
 on the contrary if they have a choice 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.520
 see super high quality picture 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.860
 but rather rattling bad sound they 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.260
 switch off and choose another where good 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.280
 sound because the sound is really 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.920
 more important than the external picture that you can 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.590
 do about the sound of course buy 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:00.000
 remote microphone is simply unique 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.129
 guys attention if you shoot and even 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.010
 if you shoot on iphone windows what 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.930
 please try to buy yourself a portable 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.119
 microphone but even more so if you bought 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.360
 imagine a good camera 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.570
 buy a microphone i will repeat it 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.860
 than a million times in the future but the law 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:21.659
 let it be a little buttonhole 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.640
 show no i don't have but very so 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.310
 tiny know include this already 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.100
 better than nothing you can buy such 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.880
 large microphone remote 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.920
 they have professional microphones 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.740
 cost of homeland but basically you can 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.869
 start low cost just for 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:42.000
 two three thousand rubles you can buy 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:43.560
 already normal more or less microphone if 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.110
 you have the opportunity to spend more 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.659
 money then of course medium so normal 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.130
 already something like that 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:54.299
 semi-professional will cost in 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.920
 around 15 thousand so look well and 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.509
 already further completely professional 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.880
 there are more cool things will cost 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.670
 endlessly expensive so up 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.560
 microphone there are different types of mounting 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.049
 microphones here I already talked about 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.610
 buttonhole buttonholes are convenient because 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.679
 little mobile you him so 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.080
 hooked up under clothes simple 0 and 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.880
 stuck out there and they are not visible too 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.010
 buttonhole can be used if you 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.230
 Stream for example games on the computer 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.100
 dialogue on such a laptop then 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.350
 respectively 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.920
 petlichka it will just hang you and 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.200
 you will be her free hand next is 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.260
 Another option is a microphone tincture which 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.870
 worth antiban concern I stand here it is 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.910
 such a high top microphone is comfortable 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.620
 if you sing for a check to everything easier 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.190
 we you need to change the height of this 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:44.580
 microphone is often another microphone option 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:47.819
 A very convenient option is this camera and 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.640
 here is your camera int this here is a nest above 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:53.549
 The camera here usually inserts a flash 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.709
 in general, you understand digital also there 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:58.410
 I can insert a microphone for me 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:01.700
 so my remote microphone is worth it 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.410
 nest to flash it is very convenient here 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.180
 it is also a convenient option for us 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.180
 rendered to the master class 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.100
 such a microphone rendezvous which is on him 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.950
 no wire and it connects through 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.470
 such a box is a box connected 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.790
 to your camera tweezers something through 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.040
 Wi-Fi or something, respectively 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.409
 and you have a box is the pocket and he 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.260
 the microphone is also attached somewhere but no 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:29.500
 no wires this is very convenient one 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.750
 accordingly what we were advised on 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.560
 master class we were advised to pay 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:39.879
 attention to the buttonhole and microphone from 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.530
 sennheiser companies so that type is just 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:43.060
 they are used therefore they said that 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.970
 they like and donâ€™t know maybe it was 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.159
 type advertising is something at least 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.139
 they are boiled on the internet 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:52.450
 I bought sennheiser ie I do not know how much 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:56.200

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.450

 buy you soft box or not buy 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.049
 buy better sound and generally in any 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.400
 As soon as you have a camera 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.709
 think about the good sound 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.169
 more important than much light 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.660
