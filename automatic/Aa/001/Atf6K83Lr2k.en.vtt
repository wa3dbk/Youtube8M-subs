00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.620
 hello friends a taste again be 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.510
 with you as you saw the figure that 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.210
 let's do today is the 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.790
 puppy 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.010
 and basic that is representative again 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.890
 itself the balloon twisting is very 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.480
 simple but it 's nice, well, 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.270
 for this to do this figure that we 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:27.800
 it's like this we need a balloon 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.800
 to 8 of 12 my plan 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.780
 and well then let's comment 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.600
 start making a three sausage 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:42.740
 fingers about after we're going to 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:44.590
 make two of four fingers 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.970
 i 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.970
 and the need 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.810
 then we will make a sausage 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.390
 three fingers to form what will be your 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.030
 neck 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.660
 now without letting go let's do two 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.930
 five-finger sausages to form 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.930
 front legs 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.600
 let's say they want 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.219
 we are staying like this 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.320
 Now let's do what will be your 

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:18.120
 body let's make a sausage 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.060
 six fingers 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:24.830
 we look and we are going to make two more 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.830
 five fingers sausages 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.000
 here is a 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.940
 and you 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.400
 and well look here and we have stayed in 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.960
 yes the puppy figure and nothing else 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.960
 we will explore the air 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.390
 upwards 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.390
 so that we stay like this 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.950
 here is 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.380
 and good is a figure really very 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.110
 easy 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.820
 the only thing we have to do 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.610
 calculate the air very well for us 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.470
 is the figure and good because this is very 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.390
 simple but I wanted to show you how 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.679
 is that it's good to see you in the 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.679
