Vita<00:00:35.210> so<00:00:36.210> what<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.600> think<00:00:36.899> about<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.200> game<00:00:37.410> it's

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
Vita so what I think about the game it's

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.010 
Vita so what I think about the game it's
awesome<00:00:38.930> the<00:00:39.930> graphics<00:00:40.340> the<00:00:41.340> gameplay<00:00:42.020> the

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
awesome the graphics the gameplay the

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.450 
awesome the graphics the gameplay the
graphics<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.890> think<00:00:44.100> they<00:00:44.190> could<00:00:44.340> have<00:00:44.430> done

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
graphics I think they could have done

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.250 
graphics I think they could have done
just<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.850> little<00:00:45.239> bit<00:00:45.360> better<00:00:45.629> but<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.140> still

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
just a little bit better but I still

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.340 
just a little bit better but I still
think<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.920> looks<00:00:47.129> absolutely<00:00:48.289> grey<00:00:49.289> um

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
think it looks absolutely grey um

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.139 
think it looks absolutely grey um
something<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.770> textures<00:00:53.250> look<00:00:53.520> pretty<00:00:53.940> nice

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
something the textures look pretty nice

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.410 
something the textures look pretty nice
I<00:00:54.570> mean<00:00:54.809> some<00:00:55.410> still<00:00:55.800> look<00:00:56.039> kind<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.670> don't

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
I mean some still look kind of I don't

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.240 
I mean some still look kind of I don't
know<00:00:57.570> like<00:00:57.629> blocky<00:00:58.140> just<00:00:58.590> because<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.070> game

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
know like blocky just because the game

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.889 
know like blocky just because the game
was<00:00:59.280> old<00:00:59.640> but<00:00:59.850> I<00:00:59.910> think<00:01:00.210> they<00:01:00.329> still<00:01:00.629> did<00:01:00.870> a

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
was old but I think they still did a

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.539 
was old but I think they still did a
pretty<00:01:01.289> good<00:01:01.469> job<00:01:02.270> the<00:01:03.270> gameplay<00:01:03.589> I<00:01:04.589> mean<00:01:05.460> I

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
pretty good job the gameplay I mean I

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.789 
pretty good job the gameplay I mean I
never<00:01:05.610> did<00:01:06.090> get<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.450> play<00:01:06.780> through<00:01:07.080> any<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.619> the

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
never did get to play through any of the

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.609 
never did get to play through any of the
metal<00:01:08.100> gear<00:01:08.250> solid<00:01:08.430> game<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:09.049> getting<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.260> play

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
metal gear solid game so getting to play

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.640 
metal gear solid game so getting to play
I<00:01:11.369> played<00:01:12.000> maybe<00:01:12.270> total<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:12.720> like<00:01:12.840> 10<00:01:13.080> hours<00:01:13.110> so

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
I played maybe total of like 10 hours so

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.550 
I played maybe total of like 10 hours so
far<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.939> think<00:01:15.080> it's<00:01:16.080> great<00:01:16.650> i'm<00:01:18.350> like<00:01:19.350> it's

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
really fun you get to just kill people

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.640 
really fun you get to just kill people
be<00:01:22.350> stealthy<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:23.240> mean<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:25.110> not<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.439> lot<00:01:25.500> of

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
be stealthy I mean that not a lot of

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.830 
be stealthy I mean that not a lot of
games<00:01:25.950> do<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.460> now<00:01:26.759> I'm<00:01:27.030> mostly<00:01:27.600> it's<00:01:27.810> just

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
games do that now I'm mostly it's just

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.609 
games do that now I'm mostly it's just
like<00:01:28.490> you<00:01:29.490> know<00:01:29.520> shoot<00:01:30.030> everyone<00:01:30.590> though<00:01:31.590> I

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
like you know shoot everyone though I

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.410 
like you know shoot everyone though I
waste<00:01:31.950> your<00:01:32.130> ammo<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:32.729> game<00:01:33.000> doesn't<00:01:33.240> do

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
waste your ammo this game doesn't do

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.109 
waste your ammo this game doesn't do
that<00:01:33.570> all<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:34.020> game<00:01:34.290> makes<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:35.119> actually

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
that all this game makes you actually

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.410 
that all this game makes you actually
think<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.720> what<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.110> um<00:01:37.430> have<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.670> do<00:01:38.820> next<00:01:39.030> you

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
think of what you um have to do next you

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.050 
think of what you um have to do next you
can't<00:01:39.630> just<00:01:39.689> go<00:01:39.960> guns<00:01:40.950> blazing<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.729> mean<00:01:41.939> you

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
can't just go guns blazing I mean you

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.130 
can't just go guns blazing I mean you
could<00:01:42.299> but<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.689> probably<00:01:43.110> die<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:44.090> I<00:01:45.110> try<00:01:46.110> to

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
could but you probably die and I try to

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.560 
could but you probably die and I try to
do<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.560> did<00:01:47.040> die<00:01:47.280> quite<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.909> few<00:01:48.119> times<00:01:48.149> I

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
do that I did die quite a few times I

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.760 
do that I did die quite a few times I
have<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.840> say<00:01:49.939> the<00:01:50.939> controls<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.810> think<00:01:52.619> they

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
have to say the controls I think they

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.039 
have to say the controls I think they
work<00:01:53.070> good<00:01:53.490> sometimes<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.420> they<00:01:54.600> don't<00:01:54.840> work

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
work good sometimes and they don't work

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.219 
work good sometimes and they don't work
good<00:01:55.079> at<00:01:55.560> other<00:01:56.130> times<00:01:56.899> like<00:01:57.899> when<00:01:57.930> I'm

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
good at other times like when I'm

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.980 
good at other times like when I'm
example<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.219> like<00:01:59.430> when<00:01:59.640> I'm<00:01:59.729> walking<00:02:00.180> down<00:02:00.960> a

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
example is like when I'm walking down a

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.800 
example is like when I'm walking down a
hallway<00:02:01.409> or<00:02:02.030> running<00:02:03.030> down<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.180> hallway<00:02:03.450> trying

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
hallway or running down a hallway trying

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.080 
hallway or running down a hallway trying
to<00:02:04.170> escape<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.469> guy<00:02:04.680> I'll<00:02:04.950> accidentally<00:02:05.759> like

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
to escape a guy I'll accidentally like

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.300 
to escape a guy I'll accidentally like
um<00:02:07.849> going<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:09.030> cover<00:02:09.239> against<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.929> wall<00:02:10.110> and

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
um going to cover against the wall and

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.100 
um going to cover against the wall and
that<00:02:11.310> just<00:02:11.550> completely<00:02:11.790> messes<00:02:12.420> me<00:02:12.569> up<00:02:12.599> that

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
that just completely messes me up that

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.230 
that just completely messes me up that
it<00:02:13.170> slows<00:02:13.890> things<00:02:13.920> down<00:02:14.310> a<00:02:14.520> little<00:02:14.610> bit<00:02:14.940> and

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
it slows things down a little bit and

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.380 
it slows things down a little bit and
that<00:02:15.570> usually<00:02:16.280> twenty<00:02:17.280> thirty<00:02:18.060> percent

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
that usually twenty thirty percent

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.750 
that usually twenty thirty percent
actually<00:02:18.600> of<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.140> times<00:02:19.500> when<00:02:20.250> that<00:02:20.340> happens

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
actually of the times when that happens

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.430 
actually of the times when that happens
I<00:02:20.880> actually<00:02:21.030> died<00:02:22.700> and<00:02:24.860> it<00:02:25.860> gets<00:02:26.400> pretty

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
I actually died and it gets pretty

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.800 
I actually died and it gets pretty
annoying<00:02:28.440> when<00:02:28.740> I<00:02:28.770> have<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.400> when<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:30.450> keeps<00:02:30.630> on

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
annoying when I have to when it keeps on

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.350 
annoying when I have to when it keeps on
doing<00:02:31.020> that<00:02:31.320> and<00:02:32.510> also<00:02:33.510> whenever<00:02:35.360> whenever

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360
