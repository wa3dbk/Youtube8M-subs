part<00:00:26.310> from<00:00:26.460> your<00:00:26.699> textbook<00:00:27.060> itself<00:00:29.960> so<00:00:30.960> can

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
part from your textbook itself so can

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.130 
part from your textbook itself so can
you<00:00:31.920> tell<00:00:32.099> me<00:00:32.160> about<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.390> characteristics<00:00:34.020> of

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
wave velocity okay that's very nice I

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.229 
wave velocity okay that's very nice I
think<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.920> have<00:00:44.040> coated<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.789> exactly

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
think you have coated the exactly

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.470 
think you have coated the exactly
whatever<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.840> given<00:00:46.680> according<00:00:47.219> to

whatever is given according to

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.240 
whatever is given according to
scientific<00:00:48.480> method<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.500> how<00:00:49.620> exactly<00:00:49.800> do<00:00:50.219> you

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
scientific method so how exactly do you

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.069 
scientific method so how exactly do you
remember<00:00:50.340> in<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.180> correct<00:00:51.449> way<00:00:51.539> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
remember in the correct way the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.479 
remember in the correct way the
procedure<00:00:52.460> actually<00:00:53.870> we<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:55.230> can<00:00:56.219> remember

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
procedure actually we I can remember

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.660 
procedure actually we I can remember
this<00:00:56.969> by<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.390> method<00:00:57.870> our<00:00:58.530> Guruji<00:00:59.070> has<00:00:59.160> given<00:00:59.520> as

three effortless readings the whole
subject<00:01:07.740> then<00:01:08.340> we<00:01:08.970> take<00:01:09.600> out<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.960> main<00:01:10.140> point

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
subject then we take out the main point

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.780 
subject then we take out the main point
from<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.670> we<00:01:12.210> write<00:01:12.450> in<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.960> notebook<00:01:13.790> the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
from that and we write in a notebook the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.030 
from that and we write in a notebook the
main<00:01:15.000> points<00:01:15.479> by<00:01:16.049> seeing<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.530> we<00:01:16.890> can

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
main points by seeing that we can

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.190 
main points by seeing that we can
understand<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.790> whole<00:01:17.909> lesson<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.750> subject

any<00:01:33.869> answer<00:01:34.200> we<00:01:34.320> can<00:01:34.470> answer<00:01:34.680> by<00:01:35.990> outside

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
any answer we can answer by outside

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.469 
any answer we can answer by outside
there<00:01:37.590> will<00:01:37.680> be<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:37.979> much<00:01:38.159> worried<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.820> this

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
there will be so much worried that this

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.300 
there will be so much worried that this
must<00:01:39.750> be<00:01:39.900> cancer<00:01:40.350> by<00:01:40.530> seeing<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:40.860> answer

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
must be cancer by seeing that answer
