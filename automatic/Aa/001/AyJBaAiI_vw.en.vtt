00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello guys and welcome back to this 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.690
 new video and can't believe it 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.940
 I'm really recording it but today I am 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.639
 I do the death of my covers for 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.320
 iphone 5 because now I finally have it 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.540
 grouped a little bit you don't 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.330
 he did not for nothing but because you 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.359
 you know that I am not buying so many 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.970
 cover more than anything else they are given to me 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.939
 or they are not the ordinino the city 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.560
 but once in a while it's not who I am 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.539
 one of those fixed also because not 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.950
 already many do not do much with others 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.880
 things though I've been looking for lately 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.860
 group a little because I know you 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.700
 really like this kind of video 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.250
 and nothing, today I feel a bit like each other 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.829
 barbie and the magic of you gas because it has us 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.899
 given inside of fuchsia with makeup and ho 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.670
 said okay let's put a little pink too 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.079
 for the lips 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.860
 I'm about to go out with were told 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.420
 eleonora and giorgia and nothing now me 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.969
 sbrigo because otherwise I arrive in 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.100
 delay therefore amorim and assessors 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.250
 if they arrived late this is the fault 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.710
 of this video then I would say of 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.409
 let me show you first of all 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.030
 a cover I'm very fond of 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.619
 two reasons one because it was me 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:19.740
 donated by my prison and two 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.320
 because as you can see it shows a 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.900
 new york this cover is awesome it has it 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.549
 she also likes me 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.270
 really so much you know that the new 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.130
 york type my second more therefore 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.020
 I'm really glad to have this 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.979
 cover I like a lot I think it is 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.650
 like the second one because I used it more 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.810
 in this period because the first one that 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.990
 you all know very well by now 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.210
 this is it here now don't mind that it is 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.310
 dirty with red because they have to finish 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.140
 I have to remove the glaze and unfortunately 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.810
 I forgot before going in 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.390
 which to register so I'm sorry 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.369
 this cover as you can see the 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.070
 figure mail but the guy who looks like a 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.870
 pig in this way for fault 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.450
 however it is a beautiful cover put 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.179
 it seems delicate to me for the second 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.770
 anniversary or stop for Valentine's Day 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.190

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.620
 special so and it's a beautiful gift 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.660

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.790
 kind for a whole year he got it 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.350

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.680
 my example in the mirror this year 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.420

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.140
 made to a photographer 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:35.320
 if you are from roma viale libia towards the 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.820
 mac becomes Libya if you are in the area 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.270

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:42.489

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.650

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:19.239

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.940

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.160
 a mess 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:29.500

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.580
 a site that basically printed all of them 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.500

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:51.520
 site they make you cover or those 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:54.880
 pre set and then you buy one 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.800
 very simple transparent cover and there 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.430

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.639

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:10.199

 instagram you have already seen 

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:05.370
 I'm a bit scared to use these because 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:07.229
 actually they protect little but they are 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.610
 very very beautiful therefore when I know that 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:11.279

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:19.680
 nothing these seem to me to be all 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:21.629
 comets I bought from the last video that 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.729
