00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.710
 then we will attack now the 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.920
 famous exercises that will allow you 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:13.320
 learning this position and 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.940
 so we detailed four announced 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:21.060
 neutral exercises at our disposal 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:24.240
 so the first is the climbs to the 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.890
 static boat so the climbs to 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:33.450
 static boat what is it going to be 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.880
 already to dilate a little bit of time 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.050
 that is to say that the crossing of sawing 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.780
 she is very fast 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.370
 we saw that the fact that it is fast 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.040
 we will always have a lag time 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.309
 in the construction of balance 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.789
 and the construction of the taking of 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.690
 awareness of our body in space 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:56.039
 maybe the construction of the boyfriend to 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.379
 engine so we will dilate the time a 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.660
 crossing that lasts one second a 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.809
 second and a half we will try to 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.420
 dilate to the maximum to have this 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.110
 feeling on at least the length of the 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.119
 body of water the element also a little bit 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.260
 disturbing is the wake of the boat 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.960
 waves 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.450
 so there we have trouble managing and cash 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.990
 the waves in the legs 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.380
 the wagons valley removed to dilhac the 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.729
 time we remove the waves 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.979
 so how do we just do it 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:33.659
 will be positioned on the side of the boat 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:38.430
 what's called about three quarters 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.290
 back and we're going to stay pretty much at 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.689
 this height there ie on 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.880
 a length of bodies of water 600 700 800 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.430
 longer letters for people who one 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.210
 is slower largest lake eh 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.509
 well we will stay on the side we will not 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.570
 climb backward is mounted back we are going 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.229
 put at about a certain angle and 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.060
 we will stay 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.950
 so to stay at that level you 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.380
 will obviously have to exercise 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.850
 some traction compared to by 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.459
 report to the boat so you go 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.959
 instinctively look to put yourself 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.670
 in a good position 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.439
 and it says here that time what's going on 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.859
 to become aware of this 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:20.200
 position is that the coach can you 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:21.310
 say no to be careful rain a 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.069
 little bit the legs were a little 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:27.730
 straight push your hips a little 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.109
 you have little buttocks behind that 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.310
 you will become aware of seeing the 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:31.480
 first rise and the first 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.730
 mounted you will find yourself a 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.170
 little bit like that so your teacher 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.939
 your coach he will tell you done 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.659
 attention pushes so you will be able to 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:42.959
 push and hips and then work 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:45.459
 a little bending in the legs 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.180
 but over a relatively short period of time 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.480
 long 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.939
 it will last maybe 30-40 a minute a 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.049
 line thirty two lengths of shots 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:55.209
 of water loop to you to get them used 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:58.480
 gradually your brain to 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:01.150
 understand the pollution so on the side 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.430
 on the left side and after on the side 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.219
 right we call the open tea side 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.409
 closed side this will be the position by 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:10.329
 compared to the foot before an open side 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:12.189
 because we were going to hips 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:15.879
 boats closed because we have them 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:18.159
 hips closed compared to the boat so 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:20.560
 we have two crossings so two sides has 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:21.970
 crossed open crossing closed so we 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.590
 will work on the open side and on 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.299
 the closed side 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.680
 so this is an exercise that is very 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.329
 important because it will facilitate us 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.659
 basin construction 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:35.079
 awareness of the placement of the 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:35.949
 basin and the construction of flexion 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:38.079
 at the level of the legs 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:41.079
 that is to say, succeed in folding a little 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:42.790
 legs of agreement but without element 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:44.530
 still disruptive ie that the 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:51.340
 body of water on the side of the boat it is 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:53.319
 it is flat normally wave so 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.569
 there is not this disturbing phenomenon that 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:59.769
 are the wake that all the ways for 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:02.019
 a beginner value will put him the 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.629
 basin back instinctively your 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.310
 brain in an effective way and the 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:09.669
 problematic of learning to 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.799
 this position is that there is a 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:14.459
 ambivalence between the basin and 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.459
 legs 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:18.159
 if you focus too much initially on the 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.109
 bending in the legs 

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:20.969
 the brain 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.870
 will give him information to break 

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:27.780
 the pool a lot of skiers who 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:31.289
 listen to me know well there the difficulty 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.680
 to keep this position d in China is 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:36.659
 the combination between the hips 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.729
 retroverted it's a towards the boat and 

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:42.080
 some some flexion at 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:45.060
 level of the legs without breaking the pelvis 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.280
 him instinctively if you tell him to 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.780
 work too much turn the legs to 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.159
 level of bending it will break the 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.270
 hips 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:54.330
 he will put himself in this position 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.789
 instinctively and that has a lot of 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.529
 ski skiers like that and after to 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:01.889
 find this position is very 

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:04.770
 complicated it difficult work and the 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:06.319
 mounted boat climbs to the boat 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:11.069
 static 

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:13.469
 your coach will tell you that that means 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:16.289
 it's good it's good you have position at 

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:19.889
 good at trying to print it to you 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:20.550
 still small climbs to the front boat 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:24.569
 each session 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:28.550
 it's very important 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:28.550
 part of the session 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.539
 never
