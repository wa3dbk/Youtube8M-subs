ok<00:00:02.070> it<00:00:02.190> is<00:00:02.280> fifth<00:00:02.490> tutorial<00:00:03.060> in<00:00:03.120> this<00:00:03.179> series

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
ok it is fifth tutorial in this series

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.269 
ok it is fifth tutorial in this series
of<00:00:03.750> cyclin<00:00:04.230> during<00:00:04.410> and<00:00:04.529> texture<00:00:04.830> Maps<00:00:05.040> I

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
of cyclin during and texture Maps I

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.340 
of cyclin during and texture Maps I
think<00:00:05.910> we'll<00:00:06.000> take<00:00:06.150> it<00:00:06.240> a<00:00:06.299> cylinder<00:00:06.720> in<00:00:07.049> the

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
think we'll take it a cylinder in the

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.919 
think we'll take it a cylinder in the
scene<00:00:07.589> and<00:00:07.859> we'll<00:00:08.490> use<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.660> existing

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
scene and we'll use the existing

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.749 
scene and we'll use the existing
objections<00:00:10.679> that<00:00:10.769> they<00:00:10.950> have<00:00:11.099> built<00:00:11.340> in<00:00:11.460> for

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
objections that they have built in for

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.499 
objections that they have built in for
us<00:00:11.870> let's<00:00:12.870> see<00:00:13.139> so<00:00:13.740> we'll<00:00:13.889> add<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.360> move<00:00:15.360> this

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
us let's see so we'll add a move this

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.330 
us let's see so we'll add a move this
back<00:00:15.719> just<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.049> little<00:00:16.080> bit<00:00:16.289> again<00:00:16.590> go<00:00:17.130> out<00:00:17.310> a

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
back just a little bit again go out a

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.300 
back just a little bit again go out a
cylinder<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.119> scene<00:00:18.390> here<00:00:20.600> there<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:21.779> is

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
cylinder the scene here there it is

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.340 
cylinder the scene here there it is
alright<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.760> then<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.539> might<00:00:24.720> imagine<00:00:24.930> if<00:00:25.199> we

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
alright and then you might imagine if we

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.519 
alright and then you might imagine if we
were<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.500> try<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:25.920> grab<00:00:26.460> this<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.150> grab<00:00:27.960> maybe

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
were to try and grab this and grab maybe

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.900 
were to try and grab this and grab maybe
this<00:00:28.890> edge<00:00:29.220> like<00:00:30.119> here<00:00:30.840> maybe<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:32.099> edge<00:00:32.369> over

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
this edge like here maybe that edge over

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.450 
this edge like here maybe that edge over
there<00:00:34.910> that<00:00:35.910> those<00:00:36.809> might<00:00:37.200> fall<00:00:37.590> open<00:00:38.100> and

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
there that those might fall open and

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.520 
there that those might fall open and
then<00:00:38.760> maybe<00:00:39.030> we'd<00:00:39.210> have<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.480> grab<00:00:39.750> maybe<00:00:40.320> an

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
then maybe we'd have to grab maybe an

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.840 
then maybe we'd have to grab maybe an
edge<00:00:40.800> here<00:00:41.579> grab<00:00:42.570> this<00:00:42.600> also<00:00:43.520> will<00:00:44.520> see<00:00:44.730> what

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
edge here grab this also will see what

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.160 
edge here grab this also will see what
that<00:00:44.969> looks<00:00:45.030> like<00:00:45.270> we'll<00:00:45.480> just<00:00:45.510> do<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:45.930> first

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
that looks like we'll just do this first

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.639 
that looks like we'll just do this first
and<00:00:49.010> let's<00:00:50.010> go<00:00:50.129> get<00:00:50.280> our<00:00:50.750> UV<00:00:51.750> window<00:00:52.289> there<00:00:52.559> it

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
and let's go get our UV window there it

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.639 
and let's go get our UV window there it
is<00:00:52.770> right<00:00:52.800> there<00:00:53.480> all<00:00:54.480> right<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.899> we<00:00:55.320> just<00:00:55.530> go

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
is right there all right and we just go

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.470 
is right there all right and we just go
mark<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.070> seam<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.699> then<00:00:57.120> we'll<00:00:57.239> highlight

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
mark that seam and then we'll highlight

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.099 
mark that seam and then we'll highlight
everything<00:00:58.190> whoops<00:00:59.190> oh<00:00:59.430> oh<00:00:59.820> I've<00:01:00.690> done<00:01:00.960> that

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
everything whoops oh oh I've done that

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.299 
everything whoops oh oh I've done that
before<00:01:01.530> right<00:01:02.449> let<00:01:03.449> me<00:01:03.570> see<00:01:03.780> mesh<00:01:04.019> tools<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.619> hit

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
before right let me see mesh tools I hit

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.760 
before right let me see mesh tools I hit
a<00:01:05.519> in<00:01:05.909> there<00:01:06.180> alright<00:01:07.110> then<00:01:07.500> we'll<00:01:07.590> come<00:01:07.740> up

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
a in there alright then we'll come up

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.539 
a in there alright then we'll come up
here<00:01:10.430> and<00:01:11.430> will<00:01:11.610> unwrap<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.799> like<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:13.979> let's

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
here and will unwrap it like that let's

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.130 
here and will unwrap it like that let's
just<00:01:14.610> take<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.270> look<00:01:15.330> up<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:15.810> window<00:01:16.110> and

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
just take a look up in this window and

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.560 
just take a look up in this window and
see<00:01:16.409> what<00:01:16.580> see<00:01:17.580> what<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.790> did<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.119> there's<00:01:18.299> our

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
see what see what it did so there's our

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.090 
see what see what it did so there's our
two<00:01:18.960> edges<00:01:19.500> there<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.250> there's<00:01:21.710> that<00:01:22.710> there

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
two edges there and there's that there

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.550 
two edges there and there's that there
so<00:01:24.000> that's<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.390> way<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.689> unwrapped<00:01:24.990> sit<00:01:25.259> for

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
so that's the way it unwrapped sit for

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.340 
so that's the way it unwrapped sit for
us<00:01:25.710> if<00:01:26.220> we<00:01:26.430> do<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.759> like<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:27.720> it's<00:01:27.869> control

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
us if we do it like that so it's control

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.280 
us if we do it like that so it's control
Z<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:29.299> there's<00:01:30.299> now<00:01:30.720> there<00:01:30.900> are<00:01:30.960> no<00:01:31.049> longer

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
Z that there's now there are no longer

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.130 
Z that there's now there are no longer
marked<00:01:31.829> so<00:01:32.729> now<00:01:32.880> let's<00:01:33.150> go<00:01:33.270> into<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.600> UV

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
marked so now let's go into the UV

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.649 
marked so now let's go into the UV
window<00:01:34.770> pressing<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.729> just<00:01:36.450> use

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
window pressing you and just use

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.050 
window pressing you and just use
cylindrical<00:01:37.619> projection<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.280> then<00:01:38.759> these

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
cylindrical projection and then these

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.520 
cylindrical projection and then these
are<00:01:39.119> in<00:01:39.329> here<00:01:39.479> because<00:01:39.720> these<00:01:39.900> are<00:01:40.110> typical

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
are in here because these are typical

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.319 
are in here because these are typical
coordinate<00:01:41.280> systems<00:01:41.610> if<00:01:41.729> you're<00:01:41.850> not<00:01:42.000> into

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
coordinate systems if you're not into

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.749 
coordinate systems if you're not into
math<00:01:42.540> typically<00:01:43.439> there's<00:01:43.619> these<00:01:44.159> are<00:01:44.310> really

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
math typically there's these are really

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.149 
math typically there's these are really
common<00:01:45.000> ways<00:01:45.390> in<00:01:45.960> order<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.380> represent<00:01:46.560> points

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
common ways in order to represent points

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.740 
common ways in order to represent points
in<00:01:47.250> three<00:01:47.430> dimensional<00:01:47.880> space<00:01:47.939> typically<00:01:48.600> you

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
in three dimensional space typically you

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.889 
in three dimensional space typically you
see<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.680> in<00:01:49.860> like<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.490> cube<00:01:50.880> x<00:01:51.210> y&amp;z<00:01:51.689> coordinates

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
see it in like a cube x y&amp;z coordinates

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.139 
see it in like a cube x y&amp;z coordinates
but<00:01:52.350> then<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:53.100> have<00:01:53.310> cylindrical<00:01:53.640> and

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
but then you have cylindrical and

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.580 
but then you have cylindrical and
spherical<00:01:54.450> coordinates<00:01:55.290> where<00:01:55.500> you

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
spherical coordinates where you

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.490 
spherical coordinates where you
represent<00:01:56.490> things<00:01:56.670> also<00:01:57.659> with<00:01:57.810> angles<00:01:58.320> as

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
represent things also with angles as

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.469 
represent things also with angles as
well<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.460> radial<00:01:59.820> distances<00:02:01.399> so<00:02:02.399> let's<00:02:03.299> just

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
well and radial distances so let's just

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.850 
well and radial distances so let's just
see<00:02:03.630> what<00:02:03.780> their<00:02:03.960> projection<00:02:04.590> does

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
see what their projection does

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.190 
see what their projection does
automatically<00:02:05.790> if<00:02:06.149> we<00:02:06.329> use<00:02:06.509> cylindrical

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
automatically if we use cylindrical

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.919 
automatically if we use cylindrical
projection<00:02:07.740> let's<00:02:08.340> see<00:02:08.520> what<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:09.360> does<00:02:09.690> in

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
projection let's see what it does in

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.400 
projection let's see what it does in
here<00:02:10.200> well<00:02:10.550> looks<00:02:11.550> like<00:02:11.810> that<00:02:12.810> looks<00:02:13.110> like<00:02:13.230> it

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
here well looks like that looks like it

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.140 
here well looks like that looks like it
just<00:02:13.440> gets<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:13.980> end<00:02:14.129> of<00:02:14.280> this<00:02:14.370> cylinder<00:02:14.700> so

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
just gets the end of this cylinder so

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.190 
just gets the end of this cylinder so
maybe<00:02:15.300> I'm<00:02:15.420> going<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:15.599> have<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:15.780> mark<00:02:16.050> it

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
maybe I'm going to have to mark it

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.440 
maybe I'm going to have to mark it
anyway<00:02:16.530> so<00:02:17.370> let<00:02:17.580> me<00:02:19.640> I'm<00:02:20.640> in<00:02:20.790> there<00:02:20.940> let<00:02:21.150> me<00:02:21.270> get

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
anyway so let me I'm in there let me get

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.330 
anyway so let me I'm in there let me get
all<00:02:21.780> of<00:02:21.989> them<00:02:22.459> and<00:02:23.459> do<00:02:23.700> we<00:02:23.940> do<00:02:24.120> that

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
all of them and do we do that

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.559 
all of them and do we do that
cylindrical<00:02:26.340> projection<00:02:26.879> let<00:02:27.239> me<00:02:27.330> see<00:02:27.480> what

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
cylindrical projection let me see what

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.320 
cylindrical projection let me see what
happens<00:02:27.959> all<00:02:28.650> right<00:02:28.800> now<00:02:29.040> we<00:02:29.099> have<00:02:29.640> let's<00:02:30.599> see

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
happens all right now we have let's see

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.000 
happens all right now we have let's see
now<00:02:33.330> I<00:02:33.360> didn't<00:02:33.660> have<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:34.050> mark<00:02:34.410> seems<00:02:34.800> or

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
now I didn't have to mark seems or

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.800 
now I didn't have to mark seems or
anything<00:02:35.310> so<00:02:35.489> that's<00:02:35.760> how<00:02:36.090> they<00:02:36.360> have<00:02:36.629> it

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
anything so that's how they have it

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.869 
anything so that's how they have it
unwrapped<00:02:37.379> like<00:02:37.830> this<00:02:38.780> so<00:02:39.950> let's<00:02:40.950> just<00:02:41.040> try

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
unwrapped like this so let's just try

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.100 
unwrapped like this so let's just try
and<00:02:42.060> use<00:02:42.239> it<00:02:42.420> let's<00:02:42.690> just<00:02:42.870> see<00:02:42.959> what<00:02:43.080> happens

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
and use it let's just see what happens

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.680 
and use it let's just see what happens
let's<00:02:43.709> move<00:02:43.890> it<00:02:44.069> over<00:02:44.129> to<00:02:44.250> here<00:02:44.640> onto<00:02:45.569> this

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
let's move it over to here onto this

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.660 
let's move it over to here onto this
image<00:02:46.050> I<00:02:46.319> mean<00:02:46.590> you<00:02:46.650> can<00:02:46.769> see<00:02:46.950> why<00:02:47.099> this<00:02:47.160> is<00:02:47.489> an

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
image I mean you can see why this is an

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.330 
image I mean you can see why this is an
art<00:02:48.180> for<00:02:48.750> sure<00:02:48.989> I<00:02:49.260> mean<00:02:49.530> there's<00:02:49.709> jobs<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.220> can

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
art for sure I mean there's jobs you can

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.119 
art for sure I mean there's jobs you can
get<00:02:50.519> you<00:02:51.239> just<00:02:51.510> become<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:51.840> using<00:02:52.830> just<00:02:52.980> map

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
get you just become a using just map

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:54.830 
get you just become a using just map
images<00:02:53.610> I<00:02:53.849> think<00:02:54.269> you<00:02:54.330> could<00:02:54.450> probably<00:02:54.510> work

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
images I think you could probably work

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.750 
images I think you could probably work
all<00:02:55.080> day<00:02:55.230> long<00:02:55.410> if<00:02:55.620> you<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.769> really<00:02:56.099> great<00:02:56.340> great

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
all day long if you a really great great

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.300 
all day long if you a really great great
image<00:02:57.360> mapping<00:02:57.739> individual<00:02:58.739> because<00:02:59.129> it's

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
image mapping individual because it's

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.100 
image mapping individual because it's
it's<00:02:59.700> work<00:03:00.000> there's<00:03:00.420> no<00:03:00.629> doubt<00:03:00.810> about<00:03:00.840> it

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
it's work there's no doubt about it

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.220 
it's work there's no doubt about it
alright<00:03:01.739> let's<00:03:01.920> see<00:03:02.040> what<00:03:02.159> this<00:03:02.280> does<00:03:02.489> here

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
alright let's see what this does here

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.160 
alright let's see what this does here
alright<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.470> then<00:03:05.690> we'll<00:03:06.690> go<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:06.959> node

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
alright and then we'll go to the node

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:16.670 
alright and then we'll go to the node
editor<00:03:11.720> make<00:03:12.720> sure<00:03:12.870> have<00:03:12.959> a<00:03:13.050> material<00:03:15.620> add<00:03:16.620> a

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
editor make sure have a material add a

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.970 
editor make sure have a material add a
texture<00:03:17.900> connect<00:03:18.900> it<00:03:18.989> up<00:03:19.110> let<00:03:19.409> me<00:03:19.530> see<00:03:19.769> what

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
texture connect it up let me see what

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.780 
texture connect it up let me see what
image<00:03:20.310> what<00:03:20.849> image<00:03:21.120> was<00:03:21.629> that<00:03:21.959> does<00:03:22.260> it<00:03:22.440> say<00:03:23.069> oh

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
image what image was that does it say oh

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.610 
image what image was that does it say oh
no<00:03:24.769> my<00:03:25.769> I<00:03:26.330> can<00:03:27.330> see<00:03:27.599> the<00:03:27.720> name<00:03:27.870> but<00:03:28.110> simple

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
no my I can see the name but simple

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:38.860 
no my I can see the name but simple
simple<00:03:29.159> tests<00:03:29.580> to<00:03:30.180> all<00:03:30.510> right

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.530 

alright<00:03:39.870> so<00:03:40.020> there<00:03:40.170> it<00:03:40.290> is<00:03:40.319> mapped<00:03:40.650> onto<00:03:40.890> there

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
alright so there it is mapped onto there

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.600 
alright so there it is mapped onto there
let's<00:03:42.540> see<00:03:42.750> what<00:03:42.930> it<00:03:42.990> looks<00:03:43.319> like<00:03:43.610> notice

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
let's see what it looks like notice

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.809 
let's see what it looks like notice
there's<00:03:44.790> no<00:03:44.970> input<00:03:45.390> on<00:03:45.690> that<00:03:45.750> like<00:03:46.410> that<00:03:46.819> and

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
there's no input on that like that and

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.449 
there's no input on that like that and
knowing<00:03:48.030> what<00:03:48.270> vet<00:03:49.140> it<00:03:49.260> mode<00:03:49.440> still<00:03:49.920> work<00:03:50.190> so

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
knowing what vet it mode still work so

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.520 
knowing what vet it mode still work so
there<00:03:50.610> it<00:03:50.730> is<00:03:50.790> mapped<00:03:51.090> into<00:03:51.330> the<00:03:51.480> scene<00:03:51.720> like

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
there it is mapped into the scene like

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:59.420 
there it is mapped into the scene like
this<00:03:52.800> let's<00:03:53.870> just<00:03:54.870> rotate<00:03:55.740> it<00:03:55.890> on<00:03:55.980> z<00:03:56.370> a<00:03:58.430> little

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
this let's just rotate it on z a little

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.610 
this let's just rotate it on z a little
bit<00:03:59.580> so<00:03:59.880> really<00:04:00.270> there<00:04:00.540> it<00:04:00.660> is<00:04:00.780> that<00:04:01.200> green<00:04:01.590> is

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
bit so really there it is that green is

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.780 
bit so really there it is that green is
up<00:04:02.010> at<00:04:02.130> the<00:04:02.160> top<00:04:02.250> edge<00:04:02.730> of<00:04:02.940> it<00:04:03.090> there

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
up at the top edge of it there

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.300 
up at the top edge of it there
rotational<00:04:05.790> necks<00:04:05.970> a<00:04:06.090> little<00:04:06.120> bit<00:04:06.420> and<00:04:07.310> there

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
rotational necks a little bit and there

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:15.650 
rotational necks a little bit and there
is<00:04:12.830> let's<00:04:13.830> see<00:04:14.100> so<00:04:14.340> let's<00:04:14.640> try<00:04:14.970> and<00:04:15.150> line<00:04:15.330> it<00:04:15.360> up

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
is let's see so let's try and line it up

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.949 
is let's see so let's try and line it up
you<00:04:15.900> notice<00:04:16.169> they<00:04:16.380> have<00:04:16.560> that<00:04:16.799> in<00:04:17.040> there<00:04:17.250> so

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
you notice they have that in there so

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.319 
you notice they have that in there so
we'll<00:04:18.959> go<00:04:19.109> look<00:04:19.230> in<00:04:19.380> the<00:04:19.410> uv/image<00:04:19.709> editor

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
we'll go look in the uv/image editor

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.150 
we'll go look in the uv/image editor
where<00:04:21.329> did<00:04:21.450> it<00:04:21.540> go<00:04:21.750> there<00:04:22.380> it<00:04:22.560> is<00:04:22.650> all<00:04:23.010> right

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
where did it go there it is all right

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.120 
where did it go there it is all right
Heather<00:04:23.790> all<00:04:24.000> one<00:04:24.150> selected<00:04:24.750> so<00:04:25.350> you<00:04:25.770> can<00:04:25.919> see

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
Heather all one selected so you can see

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.460 
Heather all one selected so you can see
it's<00:04:26.310> there<00:04:26.610> so<00:04:26.880> let's<00:04:27.060> just<00:04:27.450> orient<00:04:28.200> it<00:04:28.380> a

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
it's there so let's just orient it a

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.120 
it's there so let's just orient it a
little<00:04:28.620> bit<00:04:28.860> so<00:04:30.200> that's<00:04:31.200> sitting<00:04:31.680> right<00:04:31.919> over

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
little bit so that's sitting right over

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.310 
little bit so that's sitting right over
the<00:04:32.580> center<00:04:32.880> like<00:04:33.240> that<00:04:35.780> then<00:04:36.780> it's<00:04:36.900> outside

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
the center like that then it's outside

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.260 
the center like that then it's outside
of<00:04:37.380> the<00:04:37.560> blue<00:04:37.860> there<00:04:38.220> so<00:04:38.550> the<00:04:38.669> bottom<00:04:38.880> is<00:04:39.150> going

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
of the blue there so the bottom is going

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.450 
of the blue there so the bottom is going
to<00:04:39.330> be<00:04:39.480> missing<00:04:40.290> that<00:04:40.320> one<00:04:40.620> little<00:04:40.860> piece<00:04:41.160> so

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
to be missing that one little piece so

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.610 
to be missing that one little piece so
we<00:04:41.550> can<00:04:41.700> verify<00:04:41.880> that<00:04:42.090> if<00:04:42.390> we<00:04:42.510> just<00:04:45.590> go<00:04:46.590> over

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
we can verify that if we just go over

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.810 
we can verify that if we just go over
here<00:04:47.160> let's<00:04:47.430> look<00:04:47.640> on<00:04:47.790> the<00:04:47.850> bottom<00:04:48.260> side<00:04:49.820> there

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
here let's look on the bottom side there

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.190 
here let's look on the bottom side there
it<00:04:50.910> is<00:04:51.000> there's<00:04:51.270> that<00:04:51.479> little<00:04:51.630> piece<00:04:51.960> that's

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
it is there's that little piece that's

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.500 
it is there's that little piece that's
missing<00:04:52.260> like<00:04:52.710> that<00:04:52.979> right<00:04:53.729> there<00:04:53.790> see

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
missing like that right there see

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.680 
missing like that right there see
there's<00:04:54.630> that<00:04:54.750> gray<00:04:55.140> right<00:04:55.880> there<00:04:56.880> but<00:04:57.660> I

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
there's that gray right there but I

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.420 
there's that gray right there but I
wanted<00:04:58.050> in<00:04:58.140> the<00:04:58.260> center<00:04:58.590> so<00:04:58.770> let's<00:04:58.950> just<00:04:59.190> take

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
wanted in the center so let's just take

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.550 
wanted in the center so let's just take
the<00:04:59.550> whole<00:04:59.580> thing<00:04:59.760> and<00:05:00.000> just<00:05:00.380> scale<00:05:01.380> it<00:05:01.410> down

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
the whole thing and just scale it down

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.450 
the whole thing and just scale it down
just<00:05:01.950> a<00:05:02.070> little<00:05:02.250> bit<00:05:02.570> you<00:05:03.570> see<00:05:03.780> it<00:05:03.930> goes<00:05:04.110> away

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
just a little bit you see it goes away

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.850 
just a little bit you see it goes away
all<00:05:05.460> right<00:05:05.550> like<00:05:05.700> that<00:05:07.190> they<00:05:08.190> will<00:05:08.370> do<00:05:08.490> it<00:05:08.640> so<00:05:08.850> d

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
all right like that they will do it so d

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.960 
all right like that they will do it so d
so<00:05:10.860> this<00:05:11.130> is<00:05:11.370> right<00:05:11.820> close<00:05:12.540> to<00:05:12.780> the<00:05:12.930> center<00:05:13.970> as

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
so this is right close to the center as

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.360 
so this is right close to the center as
much<00:05:15.090> as<00:05:15.419> possible<00:05:15.800> well<00:05:16.800> then<00:05:17.100> we<00:05:17.190> could

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
much as possible well then we could

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:22.640 
much as possible well then we could
actually<00:05:17.550> scale<00:05:18.150> it<00:05:18.330> on<00:05:19.190> let's<00:05:21.380> scale<00:05:22.380> it<00:05:22.530> on

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
actually scale it on let's scale it on

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.430 
actually scale it on let's scale it on
x2<00:05:23.250> let's<00:05:23.550> try<00:05:23.820> and<00:05:23.970> you<00:05:24.539> know<00:05:24.570> squeeze<00:05:25.260> this

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
x2 let's try and you know squeeze this

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:31.870 
x2 let's try and you know squeeze this
whole<00:05:25.710> thing<00:05:25.979> it'll<00:05:26.640> top<00:05:27.080> g

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.240 

kind<00:05:32.720> of<00:05:32.780> like<00:05:32.930> that<00:05:33.170> but<00:05:33.440> that's<00:05:33.800> missing

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
kind of like that but that's missing

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.430 
kind of like that but that's missing
down<00:05:34.460> there<00:05:34.880> of<00:05:35.120> course<00:05:35.840> you<00:05:36.050> could<00:05:36.260> just

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
down there of course you could just

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.610 
down there of course you could just
press<00:05:36.800> a<00:05:37.040> and<00:05:38.030> grab<00:05:38.510> these<00:05:38.780> vertices<00:05:39.200> like

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
press a and grab these vertices like

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.900 
press a and grab these vertices like
this<00:05:41.170> and<00:05:42.170> move<00:05:42.320> those<00:05:42.590> only<00:05:43.190> maybe<00:05:43.610> move

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 
this and move those only maybe move

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.660 
this and move those only maybe move
those<00:05:44.150> into<00:05:44.690> this<00:05:45.110> location<00:05:45.890> like<00:05:46.100> that<00:05:46.340> there

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:46.670 
those into this location like that there

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.210 
those into this location like that there
I'm<00:05:47.360> going<00:05:47.540> to<00:05:47.660> I'm<00:05:48.290> sure<00:05:48.350> you<00:05:48.590> kind<00:05:48.950> of<00:05:49.070> get

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.420 
I'm going to I'm sure you kind of get
the<00:05:49.280> idea<00:05:49.430> by<00:05:49.940> now<00:05:51.340> what<00:05:52.340> the<00:05:52.490> challenge<00:05:52.940> is

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
the idea by now what the challenge is

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.160 
the idea by now what the challenge is
let's<00:05:55.610> it<00:05:55.760> in<00:05:55.850> here<00:05:56.180> all<00:05:56.600> right<00:05:56.750> so<00:05:56.930> tab

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.170 
let's it in here all right so tab

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.990 
let's it in here all right so tab
so<00:05:57.470> there<00:05:57.620> it<00:05:57.740> is<00:05:57.800> all<00:05:58.130> mapped<00:05:58.370> on<00:05:58.550> like<00:05:58.790> that

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
so there it is all mapped on like that

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.510 
so there it is all mapped on like that
and<00:05:59.470> around<00:06:00.470> and<00:06:00.740> nothing<00:06:01.070> on<00:06:01.160> the<00:06:01.250> bottom

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
and around and nothing on the bottom

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.760 
and around and nothing on the bottom
alright<00:06:02.510> so<00:06:02.690> we<00:06:02.840> have<00:06:02.870> the<00:06:03.110> other<00:06:03.260> object<00:06:03.650> in

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
alright so we have the other object in

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.880 
alright so we have the other object in
the<00:06:03.860> scene<00:06:05.110> all<00:06:06.110> right<00:06:06.290> let's<00:06:06.500> go<00:06:06.590> to<00:06:06.650> see<00:06:06.770> what

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:06.890 
the scene all right let's go to see what

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:14.350 
the scene all right let's go to see what
it<00:06:06.950> looks<00:06:07.070> like<00:06:07.190> in<00:06:07.340> rendered<00:06:07.640> mode<00:06:12.850> yep<00:06:13.850> ok

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 
it looks like in rendered mode yep ok

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.700 
it looks like in rendered mode yep ok
well<00:06:14.570> now<00:06:14.810> we<00:06:14.840> still<00:06:14.960> going<00:06:15.350> to<00:06:15.410> need<00:06:15.530> a<00:06:15.560> little

well now we still going to need a little
more<00:06:15.890> red<00:06:16.190> towards<00:06:16.550> the<00:06:16.670> front<00:06:16.850> of<00:06:16.910> the<00:06:17.000> scene

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
more red towards the front of the scene

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.180 
more red towards the front of the scene
