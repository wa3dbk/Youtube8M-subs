what<00:00:15.260> we're<00:00:15.410> going<00:00:15.559> to<00:00:15.650> do<00:00:15.770> in<00:00:15.860> this<00:00:15.980> lesson<00:00:16.279> is

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520 
what we're going to do in this lesson is

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.160 
what we're going to do in this lesson is
create<00:00:16.880> a<00:00:16.910> new<00:00:16.970> project<00:00:17.150> from<00:00:17.990> those

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.170 
create a new project from those

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.890 
create a new project from those
PowerPoint<00:00:18.830> slides<00:00:19.190> if<00:00:20.030> you<00:00:20.360> already<00:00:20.600> have

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
PowerPoint slides if you already have

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.540 
PowerPoint slides if you already have
content<00:00:21.170> that<00:00:21.440> was<00:00:21.620> created<00:00:22.070> for<00:00:22.250> another

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
content that was created for another

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.880 
content that was created for another
elearning<00:00:23.180> project<00:00:23.690> or<00:00:23.870> for<00:00:24.440> a<00:00:24.470> completely

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
elearning project or for a completely

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.730 
elearning project or for a completely
different<00:00:25.010> reason<00:00:25.810> there's<00:00:26.810> no<00:00:27.110> point<00:00:27.590> in

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
different reason there's no point in

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.920 
different reason there's no point in
redoing<00:00:28.400> all<00:00:28.610> of<00:00:28.760> that<00:00:28.910> content<00:00:29.180> why<00:00:29.539> not<00:00:29.750> just

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
redoing all of that content why not just

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.350 
redoing all of that content why not just
use<00:00:30.170> your<00:00:30.380> existing<00:00:30.650> content<00:00:31.310> bringing<00:00:32.210> it

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
use your existing content bringing it

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.810 
use your existing content bringing it
into<00:00:32.870> captivate<00:00:33.530> and<00:00:33.739> then<00:00:34.160> adding<00:00:34.579> some<00:00:34.790> of

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
into captivate and then adding some of

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.670 
into captivate and then adding some of
the<00:00:35.000> captivate<00:00:35.510> features<00:00:35.930> such<00:00:36.140> as<00:00:36.170> buttons

the captivate features such as buttons

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.950 
the captivate features such as buttons
and<00:00:36.950> so<00:00:37.100> forth<00:00:37.370> to<00:00:37.550> make<00:00:37.579> it<00:00:37.910> unique<00:00:38.270> content

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
and so forth to make it unique content

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.470 
and so forth to make it unique content
so<00:00:39.710> that's<00:00:39.890> what<00:00:40.070> we're<00:00:40.190> going<00:00:40.340> to<00:00:40.430> do<00:00:40.579> here<00:00:41.000> so

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
so that's what we're going to do here so

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.750 
so that's what we're going to do here so

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
proportion down here you have a slider

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.569 
proportion down here you have a slider
with<00:01:29.749> a<00:01:29.779> preview<00:01:30.319> of<00:01:30.380> all<00:01:30.590> of<00:01:30.740> your<00:01:30.859> slides<00:01:31.130> so
