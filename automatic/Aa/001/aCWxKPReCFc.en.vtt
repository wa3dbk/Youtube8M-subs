 the state of fired likes to work with or not I don't have me either 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.610
 so I enjoy working 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.120
 because you can also have someone fiat minutes 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.000
 create new files or file them 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.870
 who have used it once 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.160
 slip-on is going to make a boring one 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.810
 are going to connect 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.470
 choose news hour 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.930
 and then you go 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.110
 this screen 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.780
 the country will probably get this screen 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.470
 this is the basic view 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.400
 of definition screen 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.460
 we use advanced 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.770
 what you are going to do

 that closes give a name 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.570
 and spend it 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.420
 where the files should all end up 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.210
 i live in this one 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.270
 2 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.920
 Calling 150 m2 is just because it is sitting 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.330
 have made testing times 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.250
 then I will choose 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.250
 files were all supposed to end up 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.360
 that has it in that full 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.810
 then we may pages on this works dutch

 you have to put all your files on the pick list that is one 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.060
 network drive 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.200
 which is linked to the emerging 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.509
 the moment you are logged in you can see files and you are too 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.570
 irritate at can 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.440
 I'm going to the kneecap 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.520
 he makes there 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.720
 the new folder 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.720
 I'm doing a sticker now 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.209
 they are 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:13.839
 m in the man 

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:14.879
 web design 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.879
 I make a new man 

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:22.089
 ing 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.280
 I choose not allowed 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.849
 bystander come today 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.889
 otherwise there was nothing and I was born early 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:32.889
 for now it's enough 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:35.889
 just for these two goals 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:39.159
 click ok 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.249
 the right image 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:43.729
 do you have a horse 

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:45.499
 at those sites with a drama 

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:48.139
 test week point 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:50.129
 and then you can see too 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:51.949
 were that timo state 

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:54.969
 suddenly not in sight that he via mundo 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:57.849
 traffic jams 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.439
 working at school with a Dutch version 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:02.009
 the site window 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:03.679
 files 

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:06.719
 or you remember that you use the hot key 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.889
 function keys f 8 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:10.829
 the Volkskrant reports and faithfully 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.049
 Sikkema Clack 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.049
 of course see 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:21.969
 now exists now is as defined 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:24.869
 next step is 

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:26.069
 that starts 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.569
 a number of supermarkets make why your files end up in 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.659
 to be able to make wk for 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:34.729
 html files 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:36.819
 css files 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:38.499
 according to 

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:41.459
 and for any flash files 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.309
 the easiest way to do that 

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:44.460
 so speak with justice 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:45.899
 optimal 

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:47.459
 choose a new folder 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.759
 the Dutch version 

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:52.759
 the city 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:55.379
 appears in a folder is not 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:56.829
 we can make a declaration 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:58.489
 the article 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.489
 after the man parked 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.049
 2 6 

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:14.149
 presents 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.190
 we are not going to work with flash yet so I am not going to use a new one 

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:22.439
 if you can make i leave this 

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:24.150
 to this 3 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.379
 what you do is that if you do a lot on standard 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.129
 what do you think 

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:32.080
 these are not back 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.140
 if you like the government 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.990
 make a more logical and clear folder structure 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.379
 for makes 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:39.979
 it's bad 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:41.250
 in this way 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.349
 save the files 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:46.199
 nice folder structure is ready 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:49.039
 create with new file 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:50.559
 ing is in okuma 

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:52.090
 via the file 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.719
 who won 

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:54.740
 a crossing 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.909
 disney also window 

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:59.909
 you choose this page 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.789
 then you needed 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:06.279
 and jean reno to check on we make ourselves 

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:09.599
 and does not opt ​​for the patent 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:12.069
 I was in the height of my sister 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:15.069
 doctor runs exactly that is still being worked out 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:18.749
 click to make 

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:21.719
 that's why you see the first latino document 

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:25.059
 shelter atmosphere at school this 

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:26.499
 the blank page 

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:29.240
 the study are representation 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.210
 you can do you too 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.210
 split click 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.460
 then you have the code 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.740
 the ones that are 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.699
 display on parts 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:39.960
 or code 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.139
 you only have the code we do not work for the moment 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:46.599
 and what happened to a buyer 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:48.719
 how it will look exceptional 

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:52.129
 is saving the file 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:54.169
 7s or file 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:57.169
 Save as 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.259
 was first adopted 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:01.309
 in the aex 

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:03.909
 it becomes a compact the cream 

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:06.860
 bit of usaid 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.590
 the index he goes that the check 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.150
 in which accompanied 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.150
 3 nevertheless debate is taking place 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.770
 schmidt chooses 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.990
 right and the palette you immediately see that in germany can also be one 

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:31.379
 in the sart 6 2 

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:34.490
 if you constantly do not get to see then you can again 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.490
 she popped up for new clicks 

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:42.249
 yakubu stabbed in milk cartons name is nothing and 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.900
 if you succeed at the bottom and not something 

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:54.539
 then you also see that 

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:56.009
 in the code 

00:06:56.009 --> 00:06:57.949
 that are coming 

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:00.949
 and then the store follows 

00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:17.779
 a typo 

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.449
 now you see that here 

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:24.279
 in the code 

00:07:24.279 --> 00:07:27.369
 the ride of added is that p 

00:07:27.369 --> 00:07:30.439
 that is explained and in the next listen on that is made that 

00:07:30.439 --> 00:07:32.410
 is why keeping this part of it this week 

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.659
 let's just make that out 

00:07:34.659 --> 00:07:36.990
 in structure 

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.080
 You have to hit this party again 

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.080
 before the team 

00:07:43.069 --> 00:07:46.069
 ternat look you look with a browser 

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:48.809
 after world union you taste go 

00:07:48.809 --> 00:07:50.460
 clicking on it 

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.029
 and choose preview 

00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:56.029
 at school you probably only have the choice ahead 

00:07:57.199 --> 00:07:59.050
 internet explorer 

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:02.460
 it is difficult to explain how often you can add vox to that 

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:09.610
 neighborhood life because bills were started 

00:08:12.139 --> 00:08:13.219
 for this purpose 

00:08:13.219 --> 00:08:15.349
 the first week of the debit card 

00:08:15.349 --> 00:08:16.189
 it's that simple
