00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.370
 it's an agreement that makes sense to the extent that we are in the process of 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.059
 seek economies of scale at all levels 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.530
 economies of scale in the sense that we are all subject to 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.300
 investment constraints at the same time we are forced to 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.130
 develop state new technologies it's about cars 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.880
 electric and hybrid developed diesel and strengthen the 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.080
 diesel performance 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.380
 gasoline engines 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.890
 we have to be present in all market segments from the car to 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.140
 very low price yala 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.309
 high-end sports cars in Qatar 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:42.920
 we must be present on all the countries 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.900
 for this emergence china russia india the middle east the magnificent 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.090
 and so we can not see it can we do 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.100
 all alone so we have to have more and more partners with whom we 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.200
 sharing which allows us to benefit from all these technologies 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.270
 of all these products be present everywhere by sharing the task 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.950
 wallonia sahwa had already alami vaud scales very important since 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.310
 car sign that's fine but the fact that now ladies their work with 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.940
 om bah to give us even more the opportunity to go further to be 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.940
 present to be competitive 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.850
 the aria of the benefits% ecolo will share 3 for example these cooperations on the 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.310
 purchases it is obvious that the singers and on which we will cooperate 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.380
 will benefit the three partners 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.030
 there are next to that benefits that are rather specific to 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.000
 builders the next then hugo is going to be made on the same platform for 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.100
 that the smart so that's it mostly benefited ladies laure and renault of a 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.910
 other side there is a specific cooperation das finished sedan which 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.020
 with particular engines of a diesel block that will go on cars 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.810
 infiniti that's going rather benefited 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.170
 hebert blair and for that so for us we have a lot of 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.420
 collaborations in common they also have specific collaborations for this 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.420
 which is very important is that the sum of these collaborations is going to 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.280
 represent a very positive impact it depends on each and everyone 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.280
 builders 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.329
 the same ingredients that made the success of renault-nissan weapons 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:17.819
 % bourgoin is at the base of the success of the cooperation with happiness even if the 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.099
 nature of relations but not the same aharoni knew that an alliance while 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.350
 the range there is rather strategic cooperation 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.190
 I would say percent transparency 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.820
 there my trust the fact that respect for diversity does that e and if 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.499
 you want the 100 th exchanger of shares between companies 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:38.539
 make that 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:42.679
 there will be no kind of cooperation in the long term we are not going at all 

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:46.129
 considered this operation to be something temporary 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.409
 thing that will last only a few years but things could fit 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:49.819
 in the time 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.130
 transparency 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.079
 follows a long term 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.349
 trust and respect for diversity the same ingredients that made the 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.209
 success of the alliance should play thoroughly in cooperation with Damascus
