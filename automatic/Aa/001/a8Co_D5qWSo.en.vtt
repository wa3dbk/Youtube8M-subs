00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:23.650 
week for it really does help the only
thing<00:01:22.790> i'd<00:01:22.910> say<00:01:23.060> that<00:01:23.210> lets<00:01:23.360> him<00:01:23.480> down<00:01:23.600> a

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
thing i'd say that lets him down a

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.120 
thing i'd say that lets him down a
little<00:01:23.720> bit<00:01:24.020> is<00:01:24.200> the<00:01:24.380> fact<00:01:24.590> that<00:01:24.650> he's<00:01:24.860> not

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
little bit is the fact that he's not

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.240 
little bit is the fact that he's not
that<00:01:25.520> strong<00:01:26.110> but<00:01:27.110> obviously<00:01:27.440> you're<00:01:28.130> not

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
that strong but obviously you're not

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.470 
that strong but obviously you're not
gonna<00:01:28.370> have<00:01:28.550> an<00:01:28.640> absolute<00:01:28.970> perfect<00:01:29.150> player

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.480 
gonna have an absolute perfect player

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.850 
gonna have an absolute perfect player
the<00:01:29.570> only<00:01:29.750> perfect<00:01:29.960> player<00:01:30.290> on<00:01:30.380> this<00:01:30.500> game<00:01:30.620> at

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
the only perfect player on this game at

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.200 
the only perfect player on this game at
the<00:01:30.980> moment<00:01:31.220> I'd<00:01:31.310> say<00:01:31.490> is<00:01:31.640> Ronaldo<00:01:32.000> because

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
the moment I'd say is Ronaldo because

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.760 
the moment I'd say is Ronaldo because
he's<00:01:32.330> big<00:01:32.480> and<00:01:32.600> strong<00:01:32.780> but<00:01:33.110> apart<00:01:33.620> from<00:01:33.650> that

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
he's big and strong but apart from that

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.760 
he's big and strong but apart from that
rebury<00:01:34.340> is<00:01:34.460> a<00:01:34.490> fantastic<00:01:34.940> card<00:01:35.470> so<00:01:36.470> this<00:01:36.740> is

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
rebury is a fantastic card so this is

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.680 
rebury is a fantastic card so this is
the<00:01:36.980> team<00:01:37.190> we<00:01:37.490> are<00:01:37.520> playing<00:01:37.670> a<00:01:38.120> min<00:01:38.270> it's<00:01:38.480> about
