00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.330
 here they are finally waiting for more than 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.889
 seven years the new consoles sony 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.750
 and from microsoft so 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.940
 at the same time at the close of the holidays of 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.740
 christmas what are their strengths their 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.740
 defects the answer in pictures 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.680
 the xbox one and the playstation 4 have 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.090
 many common points they are 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.280
 both equipped with a hard disk 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.680
 2500 gigas and a blu ray player 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.140
 but above all a powerful processor to 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.510
 eight hearts in balance the games he wins 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.370
 fluidity and precision and with a 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.500
 such computing power they can 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.600
 simultaneously manage a multitude 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.340
 of objects of the characters who act from 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.710
 independently in the background of 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.989
 effects of smoke and shadows 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.940
 very realistic all in put in 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.370
 very cinematic scene based on 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.879
 slow motion sequence and blur in 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.340
 background 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.410
 In short, we feel more like 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.960
 participate in a movie than play a 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.730
 action game as a bonus this news 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.530
 generations of consoles want 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.610
 to establish itself as a multimedia platform 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.009
 heart of the living room 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.770
 so she proposes the reading of films in 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.750
 hd music and video services to 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.940
 demand and even in the case of the 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.800
 xbox the TV inlay 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.950
 in a small setting next to the big ones 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.950
 issues 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.600
 the cameras opens new 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.270
 perspectives to both consoles provided 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.220
 free at microsoft option at 50 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.660
 euros at sony they recognize the 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.650
 player which allows to display his 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.570
 personal environment 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.250
 she listens to the instructions of 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.230
 the user to pilot some 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.870
 functions they serve to communicate in 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.360
 videophone and especially she renews 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.400
 the gaming experience the joysticks are only 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.140
 not to give up that of sony 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.540
 has a tactile surface and a 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.430
 button that is used to share phases of 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.980
 game on facebook or youtube 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.600
 at sony again we appreciate the speed 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.220
 launching games that runs 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.320
 before it is fully loaded 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.270
 memory and the possibility also of 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.380
 share content with the console 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.010
 brand notebook 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.420
 ps lives on his side microsoft offers 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.310
 an app for smartphones and 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.990
 tablets that expands the environment of 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.730
 game with commands from the cards and 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:14.260
 virtual accessories impossible 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.760
 to use the games of previous 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.860
 models on these new consoles they 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.520
 are simply incompatible and 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.740
 it's a pity 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.180
 sony announces the opening of a service 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.880
 line to remedy this but not before a 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.070
 or two years by the way at sony's 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.020
 multiplayer mode that was free is 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.050
 now paying moderately 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.250
 subscription of 60 euros per year finally 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.110
 can not say that the effort of 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.090
 builders focused on the design of a 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.430
 side as the other we stay in the 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.440
 rectilinear black box with an effect 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.570
 tilted for the playstation 4 and a 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.430
 two-part decor for the xbox one 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.020
 we must also know that the 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.760
 set up consoles once 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.370
 one is of balls can take between 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.790
 one and several hours before 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.790
 function 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.670
 the two new consoles remain 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:01.159
 faithful to their usual orientation 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.439
 rather family game simulation games 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:05.750
 for playstation 4 rather game 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:07.970
 of action adventure for adults for the 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.500
 xbox one then it will have to decide in 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.980
 according to his tastes his preferences 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:16.519
 maybe one of the price the xbox one 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.019
 costs 499 euros or 100 euros more 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.489
 than the playstation 4 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:23.290
 but it must also be said that she is 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.290
 delivered with the kinect sensor 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.980
