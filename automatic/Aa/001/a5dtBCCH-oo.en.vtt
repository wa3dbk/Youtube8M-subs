very important exercise because it

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.710 
very important exercise because it
happens<00:00:26.170> a<00:00:26.439> lot<00:00:26.470> of<00:00:26.830> times<00:00:27.160> you<00:00:28.090> want<00:00:28.330> to<00:00:28.450> go<00:00:28.570> up

a<00:00:28.930> hill<00:00:29.170> and<00:00:29.470> your<00:00:30.340> bike<00:00:30.520> stops<00:00:31.330> in<00:00:31.600> the<00:00:31.690> middle

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
a hill and your bike stops in the middle

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.590 
a hill and your bike stops in the middle
so<00:00:32.860> that<00:00:32.890> you<00:00:33.250> don't<00:00:33.460> have<00:00:33.610> to<00:00:33.760> go<00:00:33.910> down<00:00:34.150> we

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
so that you don't have to go down we

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
will train now to go start in the hill

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.900 
will train now to go start in the hill
so<00:00:40.030> here<00:00:40.930> is<00:00:41.110> very<00:00:41.379> important<00:00:42.010> to<00:00:42.610> sit

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
so here is very important to sit

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.689 
so here is very important to sit
completely<00:00:43.360> in<00:00:43.870> the<00:00:44.019> back<00:00:44.260> to<00:00:45.070> put<00:00:45.280> the<00:00:45.489> whole

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 
completely in the back to put the whole

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:50.700 
completely in the back to put the whole
weight<00:00:46.659> on<00:00:46.960> the<00:00:47.320> back<00:00:47.500> tire<00:00:48.720> so<00:00:49.720> that<00:00:50.290> there

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
weight on the back tire so that there

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.100 
weight on the back tire so that there
will<00:00:50.920> be<00:00:51.220> no<00:00:51.760> wheel<00:00:52.330> spin<00:00:53.250> then<00:00:54.510> after<00:00:55.510> you<00:00:55.780> sit

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
will be no wheel spin then after you sit

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:02.640 
will be no wheel spin then after you sit
back<00:00:56.320> you<00:00:56.739> put<00:00:57.729> the<00:00:57.940> first<00:00:58.210> gear<00:00:58.600> in<00:01:00.839> that<00:01:01.839> the

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:02.650 
back you put the first gear in that the

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.380 
back you put the first gear in that the
motorcycle<00:01:03.100> has<00:01:03.610> more<00:01:03.940> power<00:01:04.710> then<00:01:05.710> we<00:01:06.390> can

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
motorcycle has more power then we can

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.730 
motorcycle has more power then we can
start<00:01:07.720> the<00:01:07.900> bike<00:01:08.190> and<00:01:09.869> we<00:01:10.869> have<00:01:11.020> to<00:01:11.170> give<00:01:11.350> a<00:01:11.560> lot

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
start the bike and we have to give a lot

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.340 
start the bike and we have to give a lot
of<00:01:11.890> gas<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:13.180> clutch<00:01:13.420> control<00:01:13.690> is<00:01:14.140> very

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
of gas the clutch control is very

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.090 
of gas the clutch control is very
important<00:01:15.190> for<00:01:15.760> the<00:01:16.450> grip<00:01:16.750> for<00:01:17.350> the<00:01:17.380> bike<00:01:17.710> to

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
important for the grip for the bike to

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.760 
important for the grip for the bike to
get<00:01:18.310> up<00:01:18.490> the<00:01:18.700> hill<00:01:18.729> because<00:01:19.170> if<00:01:20.170> you<00:01:20.439> will<00:01:20.619> get

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
get up the hill because if you will get

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.349 
get up the hill because if you will get
wheel<00:01:21.100> spin<00:01:21.490> you<00:01:22.210> won't<00:01:22.479> move<00:01:23.609> so<00:01:24.609> I<00:01:24.640> will<00:01:25.180> try

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:25.359 
wheel spin you won't move so I will try

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:33.400 
wheel spin you won't move so I will try
to<00:01:25.450> show<00:01:25.869> you<00:01:25.899> now

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
if you train it you have to look that

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.410 
if you train it you have to look that
