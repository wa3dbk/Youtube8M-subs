but<00:03:57.239> will<00:03:58.230> I<00:03:58.440> think<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.889> important<00:03:59.250> thing<00:03:59.310> Tim

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
but will I think the important thing Tim

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.240 
but will I think the important thing Tim
as<00:03:59.819> you<00:03:59.849> will<00:04:00.060> no<00:04:00.660> doubt<00:04:00.889> support<00:04:01.889> is<00:04:02.099> that

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
as you will no doubt support is that

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.039 
as you will no doubt support is that
we're<00:04:02.609> looking<00:04:02.910> to<00:04:03.030> see<00:04:03.209> what<00:04:03.389> happens<00:04:03.720> at<00:04:03.810> 10

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
we're looking to see what happens at 10

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.309 
we're looking to see what happens at 10
k<00:04:04.290> because<00:04:04.700> 5k<00:04:05.700> was<00:04:06.120> just<00:04:06.569> a<00:04:06.690> little<00:04:06.840> bit<00:04:07.049> quick

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
k because 5k was just a little bit quick

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:08.990 
k because 5k was just a little bit quick
it<00:04:07.500> was<00:04:07.590> 10<00:04:07.859> seconds<00:04:08.370> quicker<00:04:08.489> than<00:04:08.700> the<00:04:08.819> world

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
it was 10 seconds quicker than the world

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.479 
it was 10 seconds quicker than the world
record<00:04:09.359> trace<00:04:09.569> so<00:04:09.780> we'll<00:04:10.769> see<00:04:11.040> he<00:04:11.220> looks<00:04:11.430> very

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
record trace so we'll see he looks very

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.220 
record trace so we'll see he looks very
easy<00:04:11.910> but<00:04:12.209> then<00:04:12.359> of<00:04:12.510> course<00:04:12.780> things

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
easy but then of course things

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.599 
easy but then of course things
change<00:04:13.620> later<00:04:13.920> on<00:04:15.169> yes<00:04:16.169> and<00:04:16.380> I<00:04:16.470> think<00:04:16.739> if<00:04:17.430> you

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
change later on yes and I think if you

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.069 
change later on yes and I think if you
go<00:04:17.639> too<00:04:17.880> fast<00:04:18.209> with<00:04:18.479> the<00:04:18.570> first<00:04:18.780> five

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
go too fast with the first five

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.250 
go too fast with the first five
kilometers<00:04:19.709> well<00:04:19.889> it's<00:04:20.040> not<00:04:20.280> a<00:04:20.310> good<00:04:20.669> thing

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
kilometers well it's not a good thing

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.439 
kilometers well it's not a good thing
you<00:04:22.260> can<00:04:22.470> at<00:04:22.590> least<00:04:22.620> adjust<00:04:23.520> things<00:04:23.729> in<00:04:24.210> the

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:24.449 
you can at least adjust things in the

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:27.730 
you can at least adjust things in the
second<00:04:24.810> five<00:04:24.990> kilometers<00:04:25.530> up<00:04:25.710> to<00:04:25.949> 10k<00:04:26.520> and

second five kilometers up to 10k and

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.050 
second five kilometers up to 10k and
regather<00:04:28.740> your<00:04:28.979> resources<00:04:29.550> but<00:04:29.880> if<00:04:29.970> you

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
regather your resources but if you

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.330 
regather your resources but if you
compound<00:04:30.510> the<00:04:30.780> error<00:04:30.900> by<00:04:31.500> a<00:04:31.530> second<00:04:32.130> five

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
kilometer segment this that's too quick

that's<00:04:34.530> over<00:04:34.860> fast<00:04:35.130> then<00:04:35.940> you<00:04:36.030> really<00:04:36.270> do

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
that's over fast then you really do

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:37.820 
that's over fast then you really do
start<00:04:36.630> getting<00:04:36.930> deeper<00:04:37.139> and<00:04:37.260> deeper<00:04:37.440> into<00:04:37.680> the

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
get yourself out of it so let's hope

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.610 
get yourself out of it so let's hope
that<00:04:42.180> they<00:04:42.270> have<00:04:42.510> adjusted<00:04:43.050> the<00:04:43.169> pace<00:04:43.380> here

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
that they have adjusted the pace here

kilometers segment fabulous crowd so I

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.540

think the publicity that has been

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.879 
think the publicity that has been
