let's take a look now let's take a look

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.190 
let's take a look now let's take a look
at<00:01:55.649> burst<00:01:55.950> mode<00:01:56.390> one<00:01:57.390> thing<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.630> often

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
at burst mode one thing that often

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.840 
at burst mode one thing that often
happens<00:01:58.229> when<00:01:58.890> people<00:01:59.159> taking<00:01:59.399> pictures<00:01:59.579> they

moves would be 30 games in a second and

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:14.280 
moves would be 30 games in a second and
we'll<00:02:07.430> see<00:02:07.610> the<00:02:07.940> benefits<00:02:08.390> and<00:02:08.979> personally

we can take a look and see what it's
shot<00:02:30.569> so<00:02:31.569> you<00:02:31.629> can<00:02:31.870> actually<00:02:32.019> see<00:02:32.700> that<00:02:33.700> it

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
shot so you can actually see that it

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.459 
shot so you can actually see that it
took<00:02:34.510> 30<00:02:35.079> frames<00:02:35.409> and<00:02:36.659> that<00:02:37.659> some<00:02:37.930> of<00:02:38.019> them<00:02:38.230> are

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:38.469 
took 30 frames and that some of them are

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:42.059 
took 30 frames and that some of them are
blinking<00:02:38.769> so<00:02:39.760> what<00:02:40.060> i<00:02:40.090> can<00:02:40.329> do<00:02:40.450> is<00:02:40.480> then<00:02:41.069> push

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
blinking so what i can do is then push

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.949 
blinking so what i can do is then push
the<00:02:42.099> shutter<00:02:42.489> button<00:02:44.849> on<00:02:45.849> images<00:02:46.389> that<00:02:46.599> i<00:02:46.629> want

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
the shutter button on images that i want

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.009 
the shutter button on images that i want
to<00:02:47.019> save<00:02:47.260> and<00:02:47.579> it<00:02:48.579> will<00:02:48.730> mark<00:02:49.389> them<00:02:49.659> on<00:02:49.870> the

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
to save and it will mark them on the

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.300 
to save and it will mark them on the
timeline<00:02:50.310> so<00:02:51.310> right<00:02:52.180> there<00:02:52.829> just<00:02:53.829> mark<00:02:53.950> to

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
timeline so right there just mark to

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.539 
timeline so right there just mark to
that<00:02:54.489> one<00:02:54.700> and<00:02:55.620> let's<00:02:56.620> take<00:02:56.799> a<00:02:56.859> couple<00:02:57.280> more

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
that one and let's take a couple more

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.240 
that one and let's take a couple more
right<00:02:57.849> there

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.080 

they're<00:03:02.740> so<00:03:03.740> as<00:03:03.860> you<00:03:03.950> can<00:03:04.070> see<00:03:04.340> there's<00:03:04.880> now

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
they're so as you can see there's now

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.780 
they're so as you can see there's now
four<00:03:05.560> marks<00:03:06.560> on<00:03:06.770> the<00:03:06.890> timeline<00:03:07.160> those<00:03:07.580> are<00:03:07.760> the

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
four marks on the timeline those are the

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.180 
four marks on the timeline those are the
frames<00:03:08.180> out<00:03:08.390> of<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:08.660> 30<00:03:08.930> that<00:03:09.770> it's<00:03:09.950> going<00:03:10.130> to

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
frames out of the 30 that it's going to

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.160 
frames out of the 30 that it's going to
save<00:03:10.400> now<00:03:11.300> if<00:03:11.360> I<00:03:11.510> stop<00:03:11.750> this<00:03:12.730> and<00:03:13.730> I<00:03:13.850> say<00:03:14.210> save

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
save now if I stop this and I say save

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.230 
save now if I stop this and I say save
selected<00:03:15.950> and<00:03:17.470> push<00:03:18.470> the<00:03:18.590> button<00:03:18.830> it<00:03:19.790> saves<00:03:20.090> it

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240 
selected and push the button it saves it

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.880 
selected and push the button it saves it
if<00:03:20.420> it<00:03:20.570> goes<00:03:20.750> to<00:03:20.990> check<00:03:21.350> take<00:03:21.560> a<00:03:21.590> look<00:03:21.740> and<00:03:21.860> see

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
if it goes to check take a look and see

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.449 
if it goes to check take a look and see
what's<00:03:22.130> in<00:03:22.220> the<00:03:22.280> memory<00:03:22.550> I<00:03:22.730> now<00:03:23.420> have<00:03:24.459> those

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
what's in the memory I now have those

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.770 
what's in the memory I now have those
four<00:03:25.850> pictures<00:03:26.800> saved<00:03:27.800> in<00:03:28.010> memory<00:03:28.450> now<00:03:29.450> if<00:03:29.660> you

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
four pictures saved in memory now if you

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.330 
four pictures saved in memory now if you
don't<00:03:29.870> want<00:03:30.080> to<00:03:30.200> go<00:03:30.290> through<00:03:30.530> all<00:03:30.590> that<00:03:30.680> same

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
don't want to go through all that same

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.060 
don't want to go through all that same
process<00:03:31.670> of<00:03:32.120> selecting<00:03:32.660> images<00:03:33.110> you<00:03:33.770> can<00:03:33.890> also

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
process of selecting images you can also

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.370 
process of selecting images you can also
have<00:03:34.459> it<00:03:34.610> save<00:03:34.790> all<00:03:35.030> images<00:03:35.060> which<00:03:36.020> would<00:03:36.200> take

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
have it save all images which would take

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.030 
have it save all images which would take
more<00:03:36.950> memory<00:03:37.250> on<00:03:37.400> your<00:03:37.430> internal<00:03:38.000> memory<00:03:39.040> but

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
more memory on your internal memory but

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.650 
more memory on your internal memory but
there's<00:03:40.340> also<00:03:40.489> another<00:03:40.760> boat<00:03:41.150> it's<00:03:41.360> called

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
there's also another boat it's called

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.750 
there's also another boat it's called
slow<00:03:41.930> mode<00:03:42.170> there's<00:03:42.860> another<00:03:43.130> button<00:03:43.400> on<00:03:43.670> the

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
slow mode there's another button on the

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.760 
slow mode there's another button on the
other<00:03:44.180> side<00:03:44.540> on<00:03:44.780> the<00:03:44.900> top<00:03:45.110> of<00:03:45.140> the<00:03:45.260> camera<00:03:45.470> and

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
other side on the top of the camera and

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.830 
other side on the top of the camera and
what<00:03:46.400> that<00:03:46.550> will<00:03:46.670> do<00:03:46.850> is<00:03:47.060> it<00:03:47.390> will<00:03:47.420> basically

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
what that will do is it will basically

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.970 
what that will do is it will basically
buffer<00:03:48.739> about<00:03:49.100> one<00:03:49.430> or<00:03:49.640> so<00:03:49.670> seconds<00:03:50.209> of<00:03:50.300> video

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
buffer about one or so seconds of video

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.140 
buffer about one or so seconds of video
probably<00:03:51.980> the<00:03:52.100> same<00:03:52.130> shots<00:03:52.670> that<00:03:52.850> you<00:03:52.970> would

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
probably the same shots that you would

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.930 
probably the same shots that you would
have<00:03:53.270> had<00:03:53.480> in<00:03:53.989> the<00:03:54.050> burst<00:03:54.530> mode<00:03:54.650> but<00:03:55.520> what<00:03:55.850> it

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
have had in the burst mode but what it

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.699 
have had in the burst mode but what it
will<00:03:56.030> then<00:03:56.270> do<00:03:56.450> is<00:03:56.480> it'll<00:03:56.750> automatically<00:03:57.470> then

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
will then do is it'll automatically then

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.530 
will then do is it'll automatically then
displayed<00:03:58.160> in<00:03:58.310> slow<00:03:58.550> motion<00:03:58.760> as<00:03:59.060> if<00:03:59.239> it<00:03:59.360> were<00:03:59.480> a

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
displayed in slow motion as if it were a

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.290 
displayed in slow motion as if it were a
small<00:03:59.810> video<00:03:59.989> on<00:04:00.650> your<00:04:00.860> camera<00:04:01.130> which<00:04:01.940> you<00:04:02.120> can

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
small video on your camera which you can

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.660 
small video on your camera which you can
then<00:04:02.420> just<00:04:02.750> push<00:04:03.290> the<00:04:03.470> button<00:04:03.500> of<00:04:04.280> the<00:04:04.340> shutter

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
then just push the button of the shutter

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.060 
then just push the button of the shutter
button<00:04:04.730> and<00:04:05.510> choose<00:04:05.870> that<00:04:06.019> one<00:04:06.290> shot<00:04:06.650> that<00:04:06.920> you

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
button and choose that one shot that you

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.009 
button and choose that one shot that you
want<00:04:07.310> let's<00:04:07.790> take<00:04:08.000> a<00:04:08.060> look<00:04:08.239> I'm<00:04:08.660> going<00:04:08.870> to<00:04:08.930> do

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
want let's take a look I'm going to do

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:10.430 
want let's take a look I'm going to do
the<00:04:09.140> same<00:04:09.350> thing

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
the same thing

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.930 
the same thing
I'm<00:04:10.620> going<00:04:10.830> to<00:04:10.890> blink<00:04:11.130> and<00:04:11.460> I'm<00:04:11.580> going<00:04:11.730> to<00:04:11.760> push

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
I'm going to blink and I'm going to push

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.770 
I'm going to blink and I'm going to push
the<00:04:12.150> small<00:04:13.020> mode<00:04:13.290> button<00:04:13.710> this<00:04:13.800> time

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.970 

now<00:04:18.780> let's<00:04:19.110> take<00:04:19.260> a<00:04:19.320> look<00:04:19.410> and<00:04:19.590> see<00:04:19.650> what's<00:04:19.920> on

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
now let's take a look and see what's on

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:25.880 
now let's take a look and see what's on
your<00:04:20.130> screen<00:04:23.810> what<00:04:24.810> we<00:04:24.930> have<00:04:25.140> long<00:04:25.350> screen<00:04:25.710> now

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
your screen what we have long screen now

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:32.330 
your screen what we have long screen now
is<00:04:27.200> basically<00:04:28.200> a<00:04:29.060> slow-motion<00:04:30.060> video<00:04:31.010> of<00:04:32.010> me

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
is basically a slow-motion video of me

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.200 
is basically a slow-motion video of me
blinking<00:04:33.620> so<00:04:34.620> then<00:04:34.890> I<00:04:35.040> can<00:04:35.250> just<00:04:35.280> get<00:04:35.880> ready

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
blinking so then I can just get ready

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.910 
blinking so then I can just get ready
with<00:04:36.900> my<00:04:37.170> crusty<00:04:37.710> trigger<00:04:38.010> finger<00:04:38.280> here<00:04:38.310> and

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
with my crusty trigger finger here and

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.190 
with my crusty trigger finger here and
when<00:04:40.920> I<00:04:40.950> open<00:04:41.280> my<00:04:41.370> eyes

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
when I open my eyes

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.980 
when I open my eyes
I'm<00:04:43.620> going<00:04:43.830> to<00:04:43.890> push<00:04:44.100> the<00:04:44.220> bucket

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:53.510 

and<00:04:49.850> that's<00:04:50.850> the<00:04:50.970> shot<00:04:52.070> that<00:04:53.070> ends<00:04:53.340> up<00:04:53.370> in

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
and that's the shot that ends up in

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
and that's the shot that ends up in
memory<00:04:53.850> so<00:04:55.010> that's<00:04:56.010> a<00:04:56.130> lot<00:04:56.340> simpler<00:04:56.790> than<00:04:57.360> the

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
memory so that's a lot simpler than the

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.210 
memory so that's a lot simpler than the
burst<00:04:57.720> mode<00:04:57.840> if<00:04:58.170> you<00:04:58.260> only<00:04:58.470> looking<00:04:58.890> for<00:04:58.950> that

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
burst mode if you only looking for that

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:09.040 
burst mode if you only looking for that

directly<00:05:10.050> on<00:05:10.440> different<00:05:10.830> resolutions<00:05:11.430> but

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
directly on different resolutions but

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.370 
directly on different resolutions but
those<00:05:12.270> are<00:05:12.480> at<00:05:12.570> different<00:05:12.840> speeds<00:05:13.110> what

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
those are at different speeds what

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.840 
those are at different speeds what
you're<00:05:13.560> seeing<00:05:13.710> here<00:05:13.830> is<00:05:13.980> input<00:05:14.400> a<00:05:14.430> pic<00:05:14.640> frame

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
you're seeing here is input a pic frame

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.590 
you're seeing here is input a pic frame
per<00:05:14.970> second<00:05:15.330> 480<00:05:15.750> x<00:05:15.930> 360<00:05:16.500> now<00:05:17.280> it's<00:05:18.120> so<00:05:18.300> smooth

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
per second 480 x 360 now it's so smooth

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.510 
per second 480 x 360 now it's so smooth
if<00:05:18.900> you<00:05:19.110> actually<00:05:19.560> have<00:05:19.950> tracking<00:05:20.220> for

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
if you actually have tracking for

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.010 
if you actually have tracking for
something<00:05:20.760> like<00:05:20.850> this<00:05:20.970> without<00:05:21.150> the<00:05:21.900> high

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
something like this without the high

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.480 
something like this without the high
speed<00:05:22.260> it<00:05:22.440> would<00:05:22.530> have<00:05:22.650> been<00:05:22.740> chatting<00:05:23.340> like

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
speed it would have been chatting like

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.310 
speed it would have been chatting like
this<00:05:23.670> where<00:05:23.940> they<00:05:24.030> would<00:05:24.210> pause<00:05:24.870> as<00:05:25.050> you<00:05:25.170> can

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
this where they would pause as you can

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.380 
this where they would pause as you can
tell<00:05:25.560> as<00:05:25.770> you<00:05:26.280> can<00:05:26.370> see<00:05:26.520> it's<00:05:26.640> very<00:05:26.730> smooth<00:05:27.150> and

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
tell as you can see it's very smooth and

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.990 
tell as you can see it's very smooth and
we<00:05:27.900> were<00:05:28.230> just<00:05:28.290> playing<00:05:28.560> with<00:05:28.710> fire<00:05:29.000> that's

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
we were just playing with fire that's

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.820 
we were just playing with fire that's
what<00:05:30.240> they<00:05:30.360> do<00:05:30.420> now<00:05:31.320> there's<00:05:31.620> another

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
what they do now there's another

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.650 
what they do now there's another
resolution<00:05:33.410> that's<00:05:34.410> for<00:05:35.270> 20<00:05:36.270> frames<00:05:36.420> per

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
resolution that's for 20 frames per

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.260 
resolution that's for 20 frames per
second<00:05:37.050> and<00:05:37.200> the<00:05:37.350> resolution<00:05:37.830> is<00:05:38.060> quite<00:05:39.060> a<00:05:39.090> bit

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
second and the resolution is quite a bit

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.930 
second and the resolution is quite a bit
lower<00:05:39.420> to<00:05:39.660> 24<00:05:40.140> x<00:05:40.260> 168<00:05:40.860> it's<00:05:41.310> it's<00:05:41.490> a<00:05:41.550> bit<00:05:41.700> blocky

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
lower to 24 x 168 it's it's a bit blocky

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.600 
lower to 24 x 168 it's it's a bit blocky
now<00:05:42.720> what<00:05:42.870> I've<00:05:42.990> done<00:05:43.200> here<00:05:43.260> is<00:05:43.650> I'm<00:05:44.460> actually

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
now what I've done here is I'm actually

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.430 
now what I've done here is I'm actually
mounted<00:05:45.030> two<00:05:45.390> cameras<00:05:45.870> in<00:05:46.110> two<00:05:46.260> different

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
mounted two cameras in two different

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.440 
mounted two cameras in two different
directions<00:05:46.560> so<00:05:47.010> you<00:05:47.100> can<00:05:47.250> see<00:05:47.460> when<00:05:48.150> I<00:05:48.180> go<00:05:48.420> to

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:48.450 
directions so you can see when I go to

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.540 
directions so you can see when I go to
the<00:05:48.660> two<00:05:48.810> directions<00:05:49.320> you<00:05:49.770> can<00:05:49.980> kind<00:05:50.220> of<00:05:50.250> tell

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
the two directions you can kind of tell

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.270 
the two directions you can kind of tell
that<00:05:50.820> the<00:05:50.940> lighting<00:05:51.300> is<00:05:51.720> not<00:05:52.020> as<00:05:52.200> good<00:05:52.440> the

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
that the lighting is not as good the

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.300 
that the lighting is not as good the
high-speed<00:05:54.620> functions<00:05:55.620> of<00:05:55.710> the<00:05:55.800> schema<00:05:56.130> do

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
high-speed functions of the schema do

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.510 
high-speed functions of the schema do
require<00:05:56.790> very<00:05:57.300> very<00:05:57.570> good<00:05:57.720> lighting<00:05:57.990> this<00:05:58.770> was

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
require very very good lighting this was

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.820 
require very very good lighting this was
designed<00:06:00.000> for<00:06:00.600> sporting<00:06:01.080> events<00:06:01.410> outdoors

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
designed for sporting events outdoors

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.860 
designed for sporting events outdoors
and<00:06:02.070> sunlight<00:06:02.430> very<00:06:03.090> bright<00:06:03.270> lights<00:06:03.540> and<00:06:03.660> so

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
and sunlight very bright lights and so

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.920 
and sunlight very bright lights and so
forth

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.570 

now<00:06:07.930> I've<00:06:08.050> purchased<00:06:08.350> two<00:06:08.770> of<00:06:08.800> these<00:06:09.070> cameras

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
now I've purchased two of these cameras

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.970 
now I've purchased two of these cameras
so<00:06:09.730> I<00:06:09.790> can<00:06:09.940> do<00:06:10.120> things<00:06:10.420> like<00:06:10.540> this<00:06:10.720> and<00:06:11.230> there's

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:11.980 
so I can do things like this and there's

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.590 
so I can do things like this and there's
a<00:06:12.040> couple<00:06:12.220> other<00:06:12.460> of<00:06:12.820> interesting<00:06:13.300> things<00:06:13.510> i

want to show into some upcoming videos
where<00:06:15.610> we'll<00:06:15.820> use<00:06:16.030> two<00:06:16.240> cameras<00:06:16.720> at<00:06:16.870> high

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:16.990 
where we'll use two cameras at high

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.200 
where we'll use two cameras at high
speed<00:06:17.260> but<00:06:17.950> in<00:06:18.160> the<00:06:18.370> end<00:06:18.490> we're<00:06:18.790> going<00:06:18.970> to<00:06:19.030> give

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.210 
speed but in the end we're going to give

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.080 
speed but in the end we're going to give
