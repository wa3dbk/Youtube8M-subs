00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
think it's one of the best playlist that

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.360 
think it's one of the best playlist that
they've<00:00:40.830> come<00:00:41.010> out<00:00:41.129> with<00:00:43.040> just<00:00:44.040> my<00:00:44.129> thoughts

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
they've come out with just my thoughts

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.520 
they've come out with just my thoughts
on<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.580> bare<00:00:44.760> bones<00:00:44.970> the<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.900> free<00:00:46.140> for<00:00:46.410> all

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
on the bare bones the the free for all

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.430 
on the bare bones the the free for all
the<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.100> team<00:00:47.309> deathmatch<00:00:47.699> and<00:00:48.030> the

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
the the team deathmatch and the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.110 
the the team deathmatch and the
objectives<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.590> like<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.950> like<00:00:50.010> objective<00:00:50.730> the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
objectives I like I like objective the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.840 
objectives I like I like objective the
objective<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.960> think<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.520> team<00:00:54.149> deathmatch<00:00:54.629> /

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
objective I think the team deathmatch /

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.770 
objective I think the team deathmatch /
free-for-all<00:00:56.850> hybrid<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.660> think<00:00:58.410> it's<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:59.780> think

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
free-for-all hybrid I think it's I think

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.160 
free-for-all hybrid I think it's I think
it's<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.410> good<00:01:01.559> idea<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:02.309> theory<00:01:02.700> it's<00:01:03.660> just<00:01:03.989> it

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
it's a good idea in theory it's just it

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.300 
it's a good idea in theory it's just it
should<00:01:04.379> just<00:01:04.649> stay<00:01:04.890> free<00:01:05.190> for<00:01:05.399> all<00:01:05.570> I<00:01:07.310> think

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
should just stay free for all I think

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.240 
should just stay free for all I think
and<00:01:08.610> they<00:01:08.970> should<00:01:09.210> maybe<00:01:09.810> use<00:01:10.590> different<00:01:11.070> maps

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
and they should maybe use different maps

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.889 
and they should maybe use different maps
for<00:01:11.550> different<00:01:11.850> game<00:01:12.030> types<00:01:12.060> because<00:01:12.869> just

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:12.899 
for different game types because just

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:15.770 
for different game types because just
not<00:01:13.470> every<00:01:13.800> map<00:01:14.039> is<00:01:14.310> automatically<00:01:15.270> made<00:01:15.570> up

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
not every map is automatically made up

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.660 
not every map is automatically made up
for<00:01:16.020> every<00:01:16.259> game<00:01:16.410> type<00:01:16.710> like<00:01:16.920> fuel<00:01:17.280> this<00:01:17.550> is

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
for every game type like fuel this is

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.570 
for every game type like fuel this is
just<00:01:17.850> it's<00:01:18.090> it's<00:01:18.869> really<00:01:19.289> hard<00:01:19.800> or<00:01:20.100> it's

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
just it's it's really hard or it's

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.030 
just it's it's really hard or it's
really<00:01:20.850> huge<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:22.200> when<00:01:22.500> you're<00:01:22.590> going<00:01:22.799> free

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
really huge so when you're going free

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.270 
really huge so when you're going free
for<00:01:23.250> all<00:01:23.570> without<00:01:24.570> killstreaks<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:26.040> really

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
for all without killstreaks you really

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.390 
for all without killstreaks you really
have<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.520> hustle<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:27.570> try<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.080> get<00:01:28.229> kills<00:01:28.560> same

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
have to hustle to try to get kills same

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.120 
have to hustle to try to get kills same
thing<00:01:29.610> on<00:01:29.960> like<00:01:30.960> if<00:01:31.140> you're<00:01:31.290> on<00:01:31.409> wasteland<00:01:31.770> and

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
I had a pretty good game I mean the

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.270 
I had a pretty good game I mean the
score<00:01:53.579> is<00:01:53.670> not<00:01:53.880> inflated<00:01:54.869> by<00:01:55.049> by<00:01:55.619> killstreaks

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.609 
score is not inflated by by killstreaks
I<00:01:56.430> mean<00:01:56.579> it's<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.790> decent<00:01:57.210> score<00:01:57.540> it's<00:01:58.500> not

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
inflate about kill streaks or anything

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.670 
inflate about kill streaks or anything
like<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.689> mean<00:02:00.930> if<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.439> would<00:02:01.560> have<00:02:01.619> had

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
like that I mean if I would have had

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.980 
like that I mean if I would have had
kill<00:02:01.979> streaks<00:02:02.280> on<00:02:02.479> or<00:02:03.479> if<00:02:03.630> this<00:02:03.780> was<00:02:03.960> a

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
kill streaks on or if this was a

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.130 
kill streaks on or if this was a
killstreak<00:02:04.520> playlist<00:02:05.540> then<00:02:06.540> my<00:02:06.750> school<00:02:06.990> would

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
killstreak playlist then my school would

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.499 
killstreak playlist then my school would
have<00:02:07.259> probably<00:02:07.710> would<00:02:08.040> have<00:02:08.100> been<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.940> lot

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
have probably would have been a lot

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.420 
have probably would have been a lot
higher<00:02:10.040> with<00:02:11.040> a<00:02:11.070> lot<00:02:11.310> more<00:02:11.340> inflated<00:02:11.940> kills

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
higher with a lot more inflated kills

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.640 
higher with a lot more inflated kills
but<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.910> was<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.090> good<00:02:15.180> game<00:02:15.540> we<00:02:16.049> shut<00:02:16.230> that<00:02:16.260> we

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
up to this point but that's at least you

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.140 
up to this point but that's at least you
know<00:03:51.180> predator<00:03:51.810> at<00:03:52.080> least<00:03:52.440> at<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:52.800> minimum<00:03:53.150> so

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
know predator at least at the minimum so

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.630 
know predator at least at the minimum so
you<00:03:54.720> know<00:03:54.840> then<00:03:55.050> that<00:03:55.140> would<00:03:55.320> have<00:03:55.440> been<00:03:55.640> led

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
you know then that would have been led

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.910 
you know then that would have been led
to<00:03:56.670> Harrier<00:03:57.150> which<00:03:57.510> may<00:03:58.110> be<00:03:58.140> a<00:03:58.260> little<00:03:58.440> led<00:03:58.740> to

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
five game or something like that but it

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.449 
five game or something like that but it
was<00:04:08.100> fun<00:04:08.370> like<00:04:08.580> I<00:04:08.730> said<00:04:09.170> I<00:04:10.170> had<00:04:10.980> a<00:04:11.010> lot<00:04:11.190> of<00:04:11.250> fun

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
that actually in this game I guess

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.470 
that actually in this game I guess
that's<00:04:13.380> why<00:04:13.470> it's<00:04:13.590> memorable

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480

and the portion where I took this path

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.199 
and the portion where I took this path
and<00:04:17.359> put<00:04:17.690> in<00:04:17.780> work<00:04:17.959> in<00:04:18.109> the<00:04:18.199> headquarters<00:04:19.209> but

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
and put in work in the headquarters but

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.510

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
headquarters just whatever I think what

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.260

they<00:04:39.650> are<00:04:39.710> doing<00:04:40.100> like<00:04:40.760> when<00:04:40.970> they<00:04:41.030> came<00:04:41.180> out

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
they are doing like when they came out

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.469 
they are doing like when they came out
with<00:04:41.330> the<00:04:41.540> whole<00:04:41.930> no<00:04:42.290> killstreaks<00:04:42.919> idea<00:04:43.580> well

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 
with the whole no killstreaks idea well

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:46.779 
with the whole no killstreaks idea well
I<00:04:44.510> mean<00:04:44.660> the<00:04:44.900> community<00:04:45.500> pretty<00:04:45.710> much<00:04:45.889> came<00:04:46.610> up

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:46.789 
I mean the community pretty much came up

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:49.960 
I mean the community pretty much came up
with<00:04:46.940> the<00:04:47.060> idea<00:04:47.090> for<00:04:47.720> a<00:04:47.990> while<00:04:48.260> now<00:04:48.320> to<00:04:49.039> make

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
with the idea for a while now to make

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.460 
with the idea for a while now to make
playlists<00:04:50.300> without<00:04:50.630> killstreaks<00:04:51.139> without

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
playlists without killstreaks without

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.290 
playlists without killstreaks without
perks<00:04:51.740> so<00:04:51.919> they<00:04:52.070> at<00:04:52.370> least<00:04:52.520> got<00:04:52.760> the

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
perks so they at least got the

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.320 
perks so they at least got the
killstreak<00:04:53.780> portion<00:04:54.169> right<00:04:55.090> when<00:04:56.090> they<00:04:56.150> came

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
killstreak portion right when they came

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.950 
killstreak portion right when they came
up<00:04:56.389> with<00:04:56.539> that<00:04:56.840> that<00:04:58.510> or<00:04:59.510> when<00:04:59.690> they<00:04:59.780> went

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
up with that that or when they went

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.129 
up with that that or when they went
ahead<00:05:00.020> and<00:05:00.260> implemented<00:05:00.800> into<00:05:01.010> the<00:05:01.340> game<00:05:01.580> the

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
ahead and implemented into the game the

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.400 
ahead and implemented into the game the
playlist<00:05:03.139> type<00:05:03.410> I<00:05:04.600> think<00:05:05.600> what<00:05:05.720> they<00:05:05.840> do<00:05:05.900> is<00:05:06.199> is

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
playlist type I think what they do is is

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.620 
playlist type I think what they do is is
what<00:05:06.889> they're<00:05:07.039> doing<00:05:07.310> with<00:05:07.520> this<00:05:07.760> just<00:05:08.539> a

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
what they're doing with this just a

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.689 
what they're doing with this just a
whole<00:05:08.810> it's<00:05:09.139> just<00:05:09.440> bare<00:05:09.680> bones<00:05:09.889> pro<00:05:10.190> objective

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:10.699 
whole it's just bare bones pro objective

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:13.540 
whole it's just bare bones pro objective
is<00:05:10.940> to<00:05:11.240> see<00:05:11.570> what<00:05:12.199> game<00:05:12.949> modes<00:05:13.160> everyone's

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
is to see what game modes everyone's

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:14.980 
is to see what game modes everyone's
playing<00:05:13.820> and<00:05:14.150> then<00:05:14.330> from<00:05:14.570> there<00:05:14.630> they'll

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
playing and then from there they'll

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.779 
playing and then from there they'll
filter<00:05:15.440> out<00:05:15.590> and<00:05:15.860> then<00:05:16.190> you'll<00:05:16.220> just<00:05:16.520> maybe

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:16.789 
filter out and then you'll just maybe

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:18.520 
filter out and then you'll just maybe
have<00:05:17.030> like<00:05:17.210> a<00:05:17.270> straight<00:05:17.630> headquarters<00:05:18.289> bare

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
have like a straight headquarters bare

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.980 
have like a straight headquarters bare
bones<00:05:18.830> and<00:05:19.160> then<00:05:19.610> you'll<00:05:19.849> have<00:05:20.030> domination

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
bones and then you'll have domination

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.230 
bones and then you'll have domination
bare-bones<00:05:21.410> stuff<00:05:21.919> like<00:05:22.070> that<00:05:22.099> maybe<00:05:23.000> even

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
bare-bones stuff like that maybe even

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.480 
bare-bones stuff like that maybe even
hopefully<00:05:24.229> it'll<00:05:24.710> just<00:05:24.889> be<00:05:25.010> a<00:05:25.039> straight

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
hopefully it'll just be a straight

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.850 
hopefully it'll just be a straight
free-for-all<00:05:26.180> all<00:05:26.419> by<00:05:26.630> itself<00:05:26.990> bare<00:05:27.650> bones

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
free-for-all all by itself bare bones

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.879 
free-for-all all by itself bare bones
that's<00:05:28.099> what<00:05:28.280> I'm<00:05:28.370> hoping<00:05:28.669> for<00:05:29.440> the<00:05:30.440> tedium

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:30.889 
that's what I'm hoping for the tedium

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:32.920 
that's what I'm hoping for the tedium
that<00:05:31.400> I<00:05:31.430> think<00:05:31.700> I<00:05:31.940> don't<00:05:32.300> know<00:05:32.389> maybe<00:05:32.690> they're

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
that I think I don't know maybe they're

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.510 
that I think I don't know maybe they're
experimenting<00:05:33.320> with<00:05:33.620> that<00:05:33.919> I<00:05:34.070> think<00:05:34.430> they

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
experimenting with that I think they

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.270 
experimenting with that I think they
need<00:05:34.669> to<00:05:34.729> add<00:05:34.880> more<00:05:35.530> players<00:05:36.530> it<00:05:36.950> doesn't<00:05:37.220> need

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
need to add more players it doesn't need

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.629 
need to add more players it doesn't need
to<00:05:37.340> be<00:05:37.460> 4v<00:05:38.000> four<00:05:38.180> that's<00:05:38.690> like<00:05:38.840> teen<00:05:39.080> tech

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.639 
to be 4v four that's like teen tech

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:42.190 
to be 4v four that's like teen tech
without<00:05:40.639> kill<00:05:40.910> streaks<00:05:41.240> I<00:05:41.630> don't<00:05:41.990> know<00:05:42.050> why

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200 
without kill streaks I don't know why

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:47.050 
without kill streaks I don't know why
why<00:05:42.770> they<00:05:42.979> call<00:05:43.190> it<00:05:43.220> team<00:05:43.700> deathmatch<00:05:44.889> so<00:05:46.060> team

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
why they call it team deathmatch so team

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.909 
why they call it team deathmatch so team
deck<00:05:47.240> without<00:05:47.510> killstreaks<00:05:48.139> would<00:05:48.260> be<00:05:48.380> would

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 
deck without killstreaks would be would

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:52.320 
deck without killstreaks would be would
be<00:05:49.070> tight<00:05:49.310> if<00:05:49.580> it<00:05:49.729> was<00:05:49.910> team<00:05:50.660> tech<00:05:50.930> instead<00:05:51.500> of

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
be tight if it was team tech instead of

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:58.810 
be tight if it was team tech instead of
trying<00:05:53.330> to<00:05:53.450> be<00:05:53.599> TDM<00:05:55.810> but<00:05:57.099> yeah<00:05:58.099> so<00:05:58.280> let<00:05:58.610> me<00:05:58.700> know
