00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:06.729
 hello here is crazy out there 

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:11.170
 rottweil the gamescom press conference 

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:13.630
 from ea and there we have the same 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.820
 start the first impressions to the sims 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.050
 4 get 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.759
 they already have their first impression 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.810
 recently collected here since the first 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:24.909
 Pictures were placed and at the beginning was 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.089
 I am totally irritated because of the 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:29.919
 trailers the colors on the 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:31.659
 have lighted green and 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:33.040
 Of course, blue was already a sign 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:36.280
 for being dennis 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.350
 I was irritated because it was 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.970
 Real pictures are real people in that 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:45.370
 see trailer and it was having quasi 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.620
 so in the trailer so that something like that 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:52.110
 But comed down to earth falls into shape 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:56.590
 a port of an informant 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.510
 and it was already at that time too 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.030
 so that people for the trader 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.920
 were used 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:07.120
 So that has quasi again this pack 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:09.430
 Trust represented yes then are virtually the 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.550
 sims on the earth arrive the 19th 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.310
 you have these new moves directly 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.620
 recognized this new style as the sims 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.680
 Acting together and I found that 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:23.950
 everything already edged and was already 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.670
 look very attractive also interest 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.220
 I really think so 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:31.840
 So personally I am with the 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.970
 radiation of the are very satisfied 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.400
 many would find what is now comic booklet and 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.860
 the hairs are all plastic harbor would 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.710
 yes my god will someday mods 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.700
 give and 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:46.840
 because we do not need and 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:49.130
 short expensive after the trailer then came the 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.770
 bachelorette francs on the stage 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.979
 that gives us a few more insights 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.080
 she granted us the shows how 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.940
 This can interact with each other what 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.220
 you can raise for different scenarios 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:06.110
 For example, if that can be with each other 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:07.250
 flirt for what kind of a 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.900
 can influence it 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.580
 if you are for example a competitor with 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.530
 so turn right around here so fast 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:21.110
 flirting more so here you are mine now 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:22.880
 piece here then I can almost like 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.950
 I could grab a violin yes 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.970
 anyway and a sad song rock 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.400
 I can play with that 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.500
 competitors with very sad 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.239
 make and then it is virtually out of the question 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.250
 set and can not fight anymore 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:40.280
 flirt and so I can dangle 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:43.700
 grab and do things with the make more 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.640
 really cool if I and the 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.130
 care since mode is so cool 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.049
 Me too, that's how horny you are 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.320
 can almost knead like a piece 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:57.799
 so he created his interest from the ground up 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:00.680
 the body forms you can now download the hip 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.720
 determine what shape and what else do I know 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.410
 a crusher you can even sort of like 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.670
 Go determine this and that are already 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.850
 very very advanced and 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.410
 so really great of the 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.180
 environment or the new city 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.709
 they have not shown anything yet so not 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.660
 a lot they have a bit of that 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.160
 bonus shown there is virtually synonymous 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.480
 again so blueprints but they existed 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.970
 three already but it looks very 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.460
 then from 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.650
 The construction mode was pretty much simplified 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.110
 and that one puts back about 75 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.850
 minutes to house magic can find 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.010
 I am very good 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.440
 So all in all, I think it's up 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.760
 At first glance very sympathetic 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.470

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:56.040
