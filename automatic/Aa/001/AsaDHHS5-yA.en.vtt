division GG has twice the power of the
previous<00:00:26.449> generation<00:00:27.039> thanks<00:00:28.039> to<00:00:28.190> its<00:00:28.340> dual

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
previous generation thanks to its dual

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.820 
previous generation thanks to its dual
core<00:00:28.940> structure<00:00:29.539> let's<00:00:30.440> check<00:00:30.650> out<00:00:30.800> the

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
core structure let's check out the

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.260 
core structure let's check out the
incredible<00:00:31.460> expressive<00:00:31.970> list<00:00:32.149> of<00:00:32.390> the<00:00:32.599> sound

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
incredible expressive list of the sound

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.540 
incredible expressive list of the sound
when<00:00:35.270> I<00:00:35.300> get<00:00:35.510> a<00:00:35.540> new<00:00:35.630> synthesizer<00:00:36.350> I<00:00:36.680> always

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
when I get a new synthesizer I always

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.729 
when I get a new synthesizer I always
make<00:00:37.820> this<00:00:37.970> sound<00:00:38.210> a<00:00:38.800> lead<00:00:39.800> guitar<00:00:40.190> sound

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
make this sound a lead guitar sound

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.110 
make this sound a lead guitar sound
maybe<00:00:42.739> it's<00:00:42.950> because<00:00:43.130> I<00:00:43.550> can't<00:00:43.880> play<00:00:44.059> the

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
maybe it's because I can't play the

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.840 
maybe it's because I can't play the
guitar<00:00:44.480> well<00:00:44.770> but<00:00:45.770> I<00:00:45.920> made<00:00:46.219> it<00:00:46.370> again<00:00:46.610> this

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
guitar well but I made it again this

00:00:46.850 --> 00:01:01.110 
guitar well but I made it again this
time<00:00:48.309> it<00:00:49.600> sounds<00:00:50.600> like<00:00:50.630> this

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.389 

this<00:01:02.120> utilizes<00:01:02.750> the<00:01:03.199> dual<00:01:03.409> core<00:01:03.800> structure

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:04.399 
this utilizes the dual core structure

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:08.530 
this utilizes the dual core structure
and<00:01:04.869> it's<00:01:05.869> based<00:01:06.110> on<00:01:06.259> two<00:01:06.530> types<00:01:06.799> of<00:01:06.920> sound<00:01:07.540> the

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
and it's based on two types of sound the

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:17.529 
and it's based on two types of sound the
first<00:01:08.810> one<00:01:09.049> is<00:01:12.850> the<00:01:13.850> other<00:01:14.000> one<00:01:14.210> is<00:01:14.420> the<00:01:16.539> attack

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:17.539 
first one is the other one is the attack

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:20.289 
first one is the other one is the attack
of<00:01:17.750> the<00:01:17.869> picking<00:01:18.229> noise<00:01:18.789> when<00:01:19.789> these<00:01:19.970> are<00:01:20.119> put

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
of the picking noise when these are put

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:30.070 
of the picking noise when these are put
together<00:01:26.770> plus<00:01:27.770> if<00:01:28.509> feedback<00:01:29.509> oscillator

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
together plus if feedback oscillator

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.499 
together plus if feedback oscillator
parameter<00:01:30.679> is<00:01:30.860> assigned<00:01:31.640> to<00:01:31.819> the<00:01:32.030> modulation

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
parameter is assigned to the modulation

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.330 
parameter is assigned to the modulation
lever<00:01:32.840> and<00:01:34.179> you<00:01:35.179> can<00:01:35.390> get<00:01:35.509> feedback<00:01:35.899> sounds

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
lever and you can get feedback sounds

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:46.910 
lever and you can get feedback sounds
check<00:01:37.340> this<00:01:37.459> out

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.810 

and<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:48.030> wawa<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.200> assigned<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.220> time<00:01:50.490> trip

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
and a wawa is assigned to the time trip

00:01:50.820 --> 00:02:00.620 
and a wawa is assigned to the time trip
pad<00:01:57.560> so<00:01:58.560> let<00:01:59.220> me<00:01:59.310> just<00:01:59.490> go<00:01:59.670> wild<00:01:59.939> with<00:02:00.479> this

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
pad so let me just go wild with this

00:02:00.630 --> 00:03:21.069 
pad so let me just go wild with this
