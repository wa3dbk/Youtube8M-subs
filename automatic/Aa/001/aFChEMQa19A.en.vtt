was<00:04:06.670> going<00:04:06.850> to<00:04:06.910> be<00:04:07.090> I<00:04:07.360> mean<00:04:07.570> it<00:04:07.780> was<00:04:07.870> pretty

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
was going to be I mean it was pretty

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.479 
was going to be I mean it was pretty
good<00:04:08.290> I<00:04:08.350> think<00:04:08.620> it<00:04:08.829> gave<00:04:08.920> it<00:04:09.100> through<00:04:09.340> and<00:04:09.459> a

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
good I think it gave it through and a

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.080 
good I think it gave it through and a
half<00:04:09.579> or<00:04:09.820> four<00:04:10.000> stars<00:04:10.360> but<00:04:10.840> I<00:04:11.079> just<00:04:11.620> don't<00:04:12.430> want

half or four stars but I just don't want

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.759 
half or four stars but I just don't want
to<00:04:13.209> keep<00:04:13.390> it<00:04:13.570> I<00:04:13.720> have<00:04:13.810> no<00:04:13.989> interest<00:04:14.320> in<00:04:14.530> ever
