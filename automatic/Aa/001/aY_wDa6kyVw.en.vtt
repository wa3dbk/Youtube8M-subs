my<00:00:18.770> name<00:00:18.890> is<00:00:18.980> Mike<00:00:19.130> goood<00:00:19.310> with<00:00:19.430> k2<00:00:19.699> skis<00:00:19.970> and

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
my name is Mike goood with k2 skis and

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.849 
my name is Mike goood with k2 skis and
I'm<00:00:20.210> here<00:00:20.359> to<00:00:20.449> talk<00:00:20.599> about<00:00:20.630> the<00:00:20.960> annex<00:00:21.349> 9<00:00:21.560> th

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:21.859 
I'm here to talk about the annex 9 th

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.880 
I'm here to talk about the annex 9 th
ski<00:00:22.099> from<00:00:22.250> k2<00:00:22.340> so<00:00:23.330> with<00:00:24.109> our<00:00:24.259> collection<00:00:24.740> we

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
ski from k2 so with our collection we

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.640 
ski from k2 so with our collection we
have<00:00:24.920> freeride<00:00:25.400> skis<00:00:25.730> and<00:00:26.029> we<00:00:26.150> really

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650 
have freeride skis and we really

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.269 
have freeride skis and we really
designate<00:00:27.650> them<00:00:27.860> into<00:00:28.099> two<00:00:28.250> different

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
designate them into two different

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.490 
designate them into two different
categories<00:00:28.699> you<00:00:29.390> have<00:00:29.419> your<00:00:29.779> more<00:00:29.989> stability

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
categories you have your more stability

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.679 
categories you have your more stability
or<00:00:30.829> powerful<00:00:31.430> focus<00:00:31.820> skis<00:00:32.090> and<00:00:32.360> then<00:00:32.540> you've

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
or powerful focus skis and then you've

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.350 
or powerful focus skis and then you've
got<00:00:32.870> your<00:00:32.989> more<00:00:33.170> playful<00:00:33.440> skis<00:00:33.890> the<00:00:34.430> NX<00:00:34.699> 98<00:00:35.150> and

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
got your more playful skis the NX 98 and

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.970 
got your more playful skis the NX 98 and
the<00:00:35.540> other<00:00:35.660> annex<00:00:36.050> keys<00:00:36.290> fall<00:00:36.589> into<00:00:36.860> the

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
the other annex keys fall into the

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.890 
the other annex keys fall into the
stability<00:00:37.640> collection<00:00:38.150> so<00:00:38.330> these<00:00:38.480> things<00:00:38.750> are

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:38.900 
stability collection so these things are

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.570 
stability collection so these things are
built<00:00:39.110> for<00:00:39.410> speed<00:00:39.470> they're<00:00:39.949> built<00:00:40.160> for<00:00:40.309> power

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:40.580 
built for speed they're built for power

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.400 
built for speed they're built for power
they're<00:00:41.239> built<00:00:41.540> for<00:00:41.839> a<00:00:41.870> very<00:00:42.110> traditional

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
they're built for a very traditional

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.560 
they're built for a very traditional
turn<00:00:43.100> shape<00:00:43.460> that's<00:00:43.699> longer<00:00:44.269> and<00:00:44.449> more

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
turn shape that's longer and more

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.720 
turn shape that's longer and more
confident<00:00:45.170> so<00:00:45.350> it<00:00:45.829> starts<00:00:46.190> with<00:00:46.280> a<00:00:46.400> metal

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
confident so it starts with a metal

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.729 
confident so it starts with a metal
laminate<00:00:47.030> construction<00:00:47.180> so<00:00:47.900> a<00:00:47.930> really<00:00:48.500> solid

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
laminate construction so a really solid

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:50.619 
laminate construction so a really solid
stable<00:00:49.309> construction<00:00:49.760> that<00:00:50.059> gives<00:00:50.300> you<00:00:50.449> that

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
stable construction that gives you that

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.319 
stable construction that gives you that
that<00:00:51.500> hold<00:00:51.829> that<00:00:51.949> stability<00:00:52.670> that<00:00:52.820> ability<00:00:53.270> to

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
that hold that stability that ability to

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.330 
that hold that stability that ability to
power<00:00:53.629> through<00:00:54.079> any<00:00:54.350> type<00:00:54.590> of<00:00:54.620> snow<00:00:54.890> condition

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
power through any type of snow condition

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.970 
power through any type of snow condition
and<00:00:55.520> then<00:00:56.149> you've<00:00:56.300> also<00:00:56.480> got<00:00:56.660> a<00:00:57.020> tapered<00:00:57.739> four

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
and then you've also got a tapered four

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.459 
and then you've also got a tapered four
body<00:00:58.219> so<00:00:58.579> you<00:00:59.480> look<00:00:59.629> at<00:00:59.750> the<00:00:59.840> four<00:01:00.050> body<00:01:00.230> of<00:01:00.379> the

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
body so you look at the four body of the

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:02.410 
body so you look at the four body of the
ski<00:01:00.710> and<00:01:00.890> actually<00:01:01.370> the<00:01:01.699> widest<00:01:02.030> point<00:01:02.270> is

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
ski and actually the widest point is

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.150 
ski and actually the widest point is
drawn<00:01:02.690> further<00:01:03.019> back<00:01:03.350> that<00:01:03.620> makes<00:01:03.800> it<00:01:03.949> very

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.160 
drawn further back that makes it very

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.740 
drawn further back that makes it very
predictable<00:01:04.850> in<00:01:05.000> all<00:01:05.119> types<00:01:05.360> of<00:01:05.539> snow

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
predictable in all types of snow

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.499 
predictable in all types of snow
conditions<00:01:06.200> you<00:01:06.979> combine<00:01:07.399> that<00:01:07.430> with<00:01:07.729> a<00:01:08.240> more

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509 
conditions you combine that with a more

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:10.960 
conditions you combine that with a more
traditional<00:01:08.649> tail<00:01:09.649> shape<00:01:09.979> that's<00:01:10.250> a<00:01:10.460> blunt<00:01:10.820> or

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
traditional tail shape that's a blunt or

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.600 
traditional tail shape that's a blunt or
tail<00:01:11.210> so<00:01:11.570> as<00:01:11.750> you<00:01:11.929> follow<00:01:12.289> through<00:01:12.830> and<00:01:13.130> really

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
tail so as you follow through and really

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.669 
tail so as you follow through and really
exit<00:01:14.060> the<00:01:14.149> turn<00:01:14.390> it<00:01:14.929> gives<00:01:15.080> a<00:01:15.229> skier<00:01:15.500> the

00:01:15.669 --> 00:01:15.679 
exit the turn it gives a skier the

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:17.859 
exit the turn it gives a skier the
confidence<00:01:16.190> to<00:01:16.280> either<00:01:16.520> really<00:01:17.179> rock<00:01:17.539> it<00:01:17.750> out

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
confidence to either really rock it out

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.510 
confidence to either really rock it out
of<00:01:18.020> the<00:01:18.110> turn<00:01:18.320> and<00:01:18.500> really<00:01:18.740> hold<00:01:18.979> that<00:01:19.160> that

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
of the turn and really hold that that

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.249 
of the turn and really hold that that
turn<00:01:19.789> shape<00:01:20.030> all<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:20.240> way<00:01:20.360> through<00:01:20.660> or<00:01:21.020> you

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
turn shape all the way through or you

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.020 
turn shape all the way through or you
have<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.500> ability<00:01:21.860> to<00:01:21.890> scrub<00:01:22.310> speed<00:01:22.610> at<00:01:22.819> will

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
have the ability to scrub speed at will

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.180 
have the ability to scrub speed at will
these<00:01:23.660> skis<00:01:23.929> are<00:01:24.080> definitely<00:01:24.560> built<00:01:24.800> on<00:01:24.979> more

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
these skis are definitely built on more

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.820 
these skis are definitely built on more
of<00:01:25.220> a<00:01:25.340> GS<00:01:25.700> style<00:01:26.030> turn<00:01:26.630> shape<00:01:26.929> so<00:01:27.200> it's<00:01:27.349> a<00:01:27.500> solid

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
of a GS style turn shape so it's a solid

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.430 
of a GS style turn shape so it's a solid
longer<00:01:28.729> turn<00:01:28.970> shape<00:01:29.270> so<00:01:29.569> it<00:01:29.630> makes<00:01:29.810> it<00:01:29.959> really

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
longer turn shape so it makes it really

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.559 
longer turn shape so it makes it really
confident<00:01:30.950> in<00:01:31.520> really<00:01:31.940> all<00:01:31.970> types<00:01:32.270> of<00:01:32.420> snow

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:32.569 
confident in really all types of snow

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:34.779 
confident in really all types of snow
conditions<00:01:32.990> it's<00:01:33.170> great<00:01:33.380> for<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:33.649> resort<00:01:33.979> but

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
conditions it's great for the resort but

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:36.669 
conditions it's great for the resort but
also<00:01:34.940> great<00:01:35.360> in<00:01:35.479> softer<00:01:35.869> snow<00:01:35.929> as<00:01:36.229> well<00:01:36.380> and

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
also great in softer snow as well and

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:39.370 
also great in softer snow as well and
being<00:01:37.069> 98<00:01:37.489> underfoot<00:01:37.759> it<00:01:38.060> really<00:01:38.539> blends<00:01:39.080> the

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
being 98 underfoot it really blends the

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.080 
being 98 underfoot it really blends the
best<00:01:39.619> of<00:01:39.830> both<00:01:39.979> worlds<00:01:40.459> so<00:01:40.520> you<00:01:40.670> have<00:01:40.940> that

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
best of both worlds so you have that

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.790 
best of both worlds so you have that
performance<00:01:41.660> on<00:01:41.810> piece<00:01:42.140> and<00:01:42.440> you<00:01:42.500> have<00:01:42.530> that

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
performance on piece and you have that

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.010 
performance on piece and you have that
soft<00:01:43.130> snow<00:01:43.310> performance<00:01:43.940> as<00:01:44.060> well<00:01:44.209> so<00:01:44.899> in

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
soft snow performance as well so in

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.800 
soft snow performance as well so in
addition<00:01:45.410> it's<00:01:45.530> a<00:01:45.709> lo<00:01:46.009> long<00:01:46.369> rocker<00:01:46.759> so<00:01:47.420> it

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
addition it's a lo long rocker so it

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.229 
addition it's a lo long rocker so it
actually<00:01:48.020> has<00:01:48.560> camber<00:01:49.280> through<00:01:49.819> the<00:01:50.030> mid

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:50.239 
actually has camber through the mid

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:52.419 
actually has camber through the mid
section<00:01:50.509> into<00:01:50.899> the<00:01:51.020> tail<00:01:51.289> but<00:01:51.920> really<00:01:52.280> this

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
section into the tail but really this

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:54.160 
section into the tail but really this
low<00:01:52.670> long<00:01:52.910> rocker<00:01:53.239> just<00:01:53.599> makes<00:01:53.780> it<00:01:53.899> very

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
low long rocker just makes it very

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.020 
low long rocker just makes it very
predictable<00:01:54.800> in<00:01:54.920> soft<00:01:55.160> snow<00:01:55.310> so<00:01:55.670> you<00:01:55.729> don't
