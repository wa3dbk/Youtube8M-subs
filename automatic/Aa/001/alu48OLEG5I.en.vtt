I love about this cane is the way it's
nested<00:02:28.879> in<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.030> top<00:02:29.300> of<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.480> cane<00:02:29.690> now<00:02:30.470> a<00:02:30.769> lot

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
nested in the top of the cane now a lot

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.910 
nested in the top of the cane now a lot
of<00:02:31.099> replica<00:02:31.610> canes<00:02:32.019> sort<00:02:33.019> of<00:02:33.110> nest<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.709> egg<00:02:33.890> a

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
of replica canes sort of nest the egg a

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.309 
of replica canes sort of nest the egg a
little<00:02:34.400> bit<00:02:34.550> higher<00:02:34.819> than<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.569> cane<00:02:35.900> shaft

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
little bit higher than the cane shaft

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.040 
little bit higher than the cane shaft
and<00:02:37.010> that's<00:02:37.610> not<00:02:37.849> right<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.390> one<00:02:38.599> in<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.810> film

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
and that's not right the one in the film

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.789 
and that's not right the one in the film
is<00:02:39.370> nested<00:02:40.599> quite<00:02:41.599> deep<00:02:41.930> at<00:02:42.230> least<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.530> hero

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
is nested quite deep at least the hero

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.559 
is nested quite deep at least the hero
canes<00:02:43.250> anyway<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:43.790> ones<00:02:43.970> we<00:02:44.150> see<00:02:44.299> on<00:02:44.390> screen

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
canes anyway the ones we see on screen

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.570 
canes anyway the ones we see on screen
are<00:02:44.900> nested<00:02:45.260> quite<00:02:45.500> deep<00:02:45.799> in<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.129> shaft<00:02:46.340> of

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
are nested quite deep in the shaft of

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.630 
are nested quite deep in the shaft of
the<00:02:46.610> cane<00:02:46.880> so<00:02:47.750> he's<00:02:47.959> got<00:02:48.140> that<00:02:48.170> spot<00:02:48.650> on<00:02:48.920> but

dinosaur skeleton

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.039 
dinosaur skeleton
and<00:03:06.700> it<00:03:07.700> tapers<00:03:08.180> as<00:03:08.299> it<00:03:08.420> goes<00:03:08.569> along<00:03:08.750> almost

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
and it tapers as it goes along almost

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.160 
and it tapers as it goes along almost
like<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.410> tail<00:03:09.680> of<00:03:10.640> a<00:03:10.760> dinosaur<00:03:11.329> skeleton<00:03:11.599> and

like the tail of a dinosaur skeleton and
it<00:03:12.290> just<00:03:12.590> looks<00:03:12.920> fantastic

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
it just looks fantastic

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.000 
it just looks fantastic
and<00:03:14.540> this<00:03:14.720> was<00:03:14.870> sculpted<00:03:15.319> by<00:03:15.440> hand<00:03:15.709> and<00:03:15.920> then

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
and this was sculpted by hand and then

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.729 
and this was sculpted by hand and then
cast<00:03:16.310> in<00:03:16.640> resin<00:03:16.810> just<00:03:17.810> like<00:03:18.049> the<00:03:18.230> film<00:03:18.500> used

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
cast in resin just like the film used

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.069 
cast in resin just like the film used
one<00:03:19.010> and<00:03:19.250> it's<00:03:19.790> also<00:03:19.940> got<00:03:20.180> a<00:03:20.209> metal<00:03:20.540> shaft

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
one and it's also got a metal shaft

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.590 
one and it's also got a metal shaft
going<00:03:21.590> down<00:03:21.920> the<00:03:22.130> middle<00:03:22.310> which<00:03:22.940> strengthens

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
going down the middle which strengthens

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.759 
going down the middle which strengthens
it<00:03:23.840> on<00:03:24.190> the<00:03:25.190> end<00:03:25.340> we've<00:03:25.579> got<00:03:25.609> a<00:03:25.730> rubber<00:03:26.030> tip

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
it on the end we've got a rubber tip

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.110 
it on the end we've got a rubber tip
I'll<00:03:27.769> just<00:03:28.010> turn<00:03:28.190> it<00:03:28.340> around<00:03:28.430> so<00:03:28.850> you<00:03:28.940> can<00:03:29.090> see

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
I'll just turn it around so you can see

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.849 
I'll just turn it around so you can see
the<00:03:29.420> end<00:03:29.569> of<00:03:29.780> the<00:03:29.870> rubber<00:03:30.079> tip<00:03:30.380> but<00:03:30.560> it's<00:03:30.680> got

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
the end of the rubber tip but it's got

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:33.370 
the end of the rubber tip but it's got
like<00:03:31.010> a<00:03:31.040> sort<00:03:31.310> of<00:03:31.340> a<00:03:31.430> nice<00:03:31.609> grip<00:03:32.260> texture<00:03:33.260> on

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
like a sort of a nice grip texture on

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.890 
like a sort of a nice grip texture on
the<00:03:33.530> end<00:03:33.680> so<00:03:34.340> I<00:03:34.370> have<00:03:34.579> no<00:03:34.819> worries<00:03:35.180> about<00:03:35.209> using

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
the end so I have no worries about using

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.860 
the end so I have no worries about using
this<00:03:36.019> as<00:03:36.200> a<00:03:36.230> real<00:03:36.530> cane<00:03:37.150> not<00:03:38.150> that<00:03:38.359> that<00:03:38.540> that's

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
this as a real cane not that that that's

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.349 
this as a real cane not that that that's
what<00:03:39.109> I'm<00:03:39.200> going<00:03:39.319> to<00:03:39.380> do<00:03:39.760> my<00:03:40.760> intention<00:03:41.180> really

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
what I'm going to do my intention really

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:43.330 
what I'm going to do my intention really
is<00:03:41.569> to<00:03:41.690> have<00:03:41.870> this<00:03:41.989> on<00:03:42.170> display<00:03:42.350> but<00:03:43.130> if<00:03:43.220> you

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
is to have this on display but if you

is to have this on display but if you
were<00:03:43.519> to<00:03:43.730> use<00:03:43.910> this<00:03:44.060> as<00:03:44.239> a<00:03:44.269> real<00:03:44.569> cane

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
were to use this as a real cane

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.360 
were to use this as a real cane
I<00:03:45.819> don't<00:03:46.819> know<00:03:47.000> how<00:03:47.239> wide<00:03:47.989> my<00:03:48.380> audience<00:03:48.799> ranges

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
I don't know how wide my audience ranges

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.580 
I don't know how wide my audience ranges
from<00:03:49.609> young<00:03:49.940> to<00:03:50.209> old<00:03:50.239> but<00:03:51.019> I'm<00:03:51.109> sure<00:03:51.350> there<00:03:51.560> are

some viewers who enjoy watching these
videos<00:03:55.340> and<00:03:55.670> probably<00:03:56.389> enjoy<00:03:56.989> using<00:03:57.440> a<00:03:57.530> cane

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
could use this as an actual cane and

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.420 
could use this as an actual cane and
what<00:04:10.970> a<00:04:11.000> decorative<00:04:11.419> came<00:04:11.870> to<00:04:12.049> have<00:04:12.290> is<00:04:12.620> it's
