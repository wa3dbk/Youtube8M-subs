to get him at three pay-per-views a year
maybe<00:02:07.469> four<00:02:07.860> if<00:02:08.459> you're<00:02:08.670> really<00:02:08.819> lucky<00:02:09.060> and

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270

think you can get a good match out of
the<00:02:11.620> guy<00:02:11.770> but<00:02:12.070> you're<00:02:12.520> going<00:02:12.700> to<00:02:12.790> get<00:02:12.850> them

SummerSlam<00:02:13.600> you<00:02:14.020> know<00:02:14.110> WrestleMania<00:02:15.030> Royal

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030

Rumble the m4 Extreme Rules twice I

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.670 
Rumble the m4 Extreme Rules twice I
think<00:02:18.850> so<00:02:19.120> you<00:02:19.660> know<00:02:19.750> it's<00:02:20.290> kind<00:02:20.560> of

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
think so you know it's kind of

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.200 
think so you know it's kind of
randomness<00:02:21.070> but<00:02:21.430> then<00:02:21.550> it<00:02:21.670> sort<00:02:21.760> of<00:02:21.910> makes<00:02:22.030> the

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
randomness but then it sort of makes the

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.360 
randomness but then it sort of makes the
rest<00:02:22.420> of<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.660> year<00:02:23.140> feel<00:02:23.470> really<00:02:23.890> weird<00:02:24.070> that

rest of the year feel really weird that

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320

of<00:03:14.500> the<00:03:14.590> authority<00:03:15.130> I<00:03:15.310> think<00:03:15.850> it's<00:03:15.970> pretty

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
of the authority I think it's pretty

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.060 
of the authority I think it's pretty
obvious<00:03:16.330> that<00:03:16.780> Rollins<00:03:17.680> is<00:03:17.740> going<00:03:17.830> to<00:03:17.980> be

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
obvious that Rollins is going to be

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.680 
obvious that Rollins is going to be
walking<00:03:18.280> out<00:03:18.610> of<00:03:18.640> there<00:03:18.790> with<00:03:18.970> a<00:03:19.000> championship

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
walking out of there with a championship

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.000 
walking out of there with a championship
I<00:03:19.750> think<00:03:19.900> that<00:03:19.990> Rollins<00:03:20.290> will<00:03:20.470> be<00:03:20.560> keeping<00:03:20.770> the

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
I think that Rollins will be keeping the

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.970 
I think that Rollins will be keeping the
title<00:03:21.340> at<00:03:21.790> least<00:03:22.060> until<00:03:22.300> SummerSlam<00:03:23.140> when

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
title at least until SummerSlam when

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.470 
title at least until SummerSlam when
Brock<00:03:24.280> would<00:03:24.459> make<00:03:24.610> is<00:03:24.730> returned<00:03:25.120> and<00:03:25.330> then<00:03:25.420> I

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
Brock would make is returned and then I

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.540 
Brock would make is returned and then I
possibly<00:03:26.050> get<00:03:26.320> the<00:03:26.410> see<00:03:26.590> no<00:03:26.830> Brock<00:03:27.100> Lesnar

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
possibly get the see no Brock Lesnar

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.270 
possibly get the see no Brock Lesnar
going<00:03:28.390> up<00:03:28.660> against<00:03:29.140> Rollins<00:03:29.650> and<00:03:30.040> one-on-one

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
going up against Rollins and one-on-one

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.580 
going up against Rollins and one-on-one
or<00:03:30.550> maybe<00:03:30.910> with<00:03:31.209> reigns<00:03:31.540> also<00:03:32.080> making<00:03:32.350> that

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
or maybe with reigns also making that

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.800 
or maybe with reigns also making that
another<00:03:32.890> three-way<00:03:33.459> which<00:03:34.209> is<00:03:34.330> kind<00:03:34.570> of<00:03:34.630> weird

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
another three-way which is kind of weird

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.060 
another three-way which is kind of weird
for<00:03:35.050> them<00:03:35.110> to<00:03:35.230> be<00:03:35.350> stacking<00:03:35.709> the<00:03:35.770> deck<00:03:35.800> with

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
for them to be stacking the deck with

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.070 
for them to be stacking the deck with
three<00:03:36.370> ways<00:03:36.550> in<00:03:37.090> order<00:03:37.330> to<00:03:37.510> get<00:03:37.690> there<00:03:37.870> but

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
three ways in order to get there but

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.230 
three ways in order to get there but
like<00:03:38.560> I<00:03:38.709> said<00:03:38.770> with<00:03:39.040> injuries<00:03:39.550> and<00:03:39.850> then<00:03:40.000> just

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
like I said with injuries and then just

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.270 
like I said with injuries and then just
you<00:03:40.570> know<00:03:40.630> Cena<00:03:41.050> taking<00:03:41.260> sort<00:03:41.680> of<00:03:41.770> a<00:03:41.860> step<00:03:42.070> down

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 
as it right now it sort of stacks the

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.170 
as it right now it sort of stacks the
deck<00:03:44.770> with<00:03:45.100> the<00:03:45.130> main<00:03:45.310> eventers<00:03:45.700> that<00:03:45.880> you

deck with the main eventers that you
know<00:03:46.270> there<00:03:46.540> there's<00:03:46.750> not<00:03:46.990> a<00:03:47.020> lot<00:03:47.230> of<00:03:47.260> matches

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530

for<00:03:47.920> these<00:03:48.040> guys<00:03:48.220> to<00:03:48.280> be<00:03:48.520> having<00:03:48.850> out<00:03:48.970> there<00:03:49.180> it

for these guys to be having out there it

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.000

seems<00:03:50.050> that<00:03:50.110> the<00:03:50.260> crowd<00:03:50.440> is<00:03:50.620> getting<00:03:50.740> behind

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
seems that the crowd is getting behind

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 
what the stipulation is going to be but

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.790 
what the stipulation is going to be but
everybody<00:04:10.209> seems<00:04:10.959> to<00:04:11.110> be<00:04:11.230> a<00:04:11.260> little<00:04:11.470> bit<00:04:11.590> more

before<00:04:13.270> I<00:04:13.480> don't<00:04:13.900> think<00:04:14.110> that<00:04:14.140> easy<00:04:14.320> to<00:04:14.440> win

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
before I don't think that easy to win

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.350 
before I don't think that easy to win
the<00:04:14.739> champion

the champion

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.140 
the champion
but<00:04:16.350> I<00:04:16.380> definitely<00:04:16.829> this<00:04:17.459> could<00:04:17.730> be<00:04:17.880> a<00:04:17.910> good

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
but I definitely this could be a good

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.030 
but I definitely this could be a good

stuff<00:04:20.160> right<00:04:20.310> now<00:04:20.370> seems<00:04:20.760> to<00:04:20.850> be<00:04:20.910> pretty<00:04:21.090> fun

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
stuff right now seems to be pretty fun
