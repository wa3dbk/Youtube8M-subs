00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.580
 started its mobilization since in some 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:25.260
 moment they reported that there are people 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.109
 that present some difficulty of the 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.269
 that transited on the routes that surround 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.949
 This edwin giant lion fire 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.470
 volunteers will give us more details in 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.019
 relationship to the volunteer firefighter we 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.540
 we found already in what is the skirts 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:41.040
 of the volcano of fire 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.720
 in several villages that are 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:49.129
 affected but the explosion this left 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.059
 quite a problem in what it is 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:56.250
 respiratory distress for 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:58.589
 people there are also places where you go 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.769
 to have to evacuate several people 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:05.940
 but so far it has not been done 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:09.440
 no plan as there 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:15.000
 the amount of ash and the amount of 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:18.090
 all that is the gas that it emanates 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.110
 it gives us a lot of difficulty to enter 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.540
 these places 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.390
 we are in communities of 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.850
 volcano fire located on the skirts of the 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.160

 been invaded by ash and material 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:42.580
 volcanic among them communities 6 the 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.670
 zapote communities 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.590

 neighbors and families that are prevented from 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.600
 they inhabit this place they have been 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:58.869
 relating that due to the cloudiness of 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.170
 these that the volcano has emanated has 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.330
 tornado a general darkness in several 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.310
 communities where they have had to 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.739
 to be able to light with flashlights 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.340
 because there is no electrical fluid due to 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:14.980
 some explosions and rock falls that 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.860

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.310
 fire here 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.490
