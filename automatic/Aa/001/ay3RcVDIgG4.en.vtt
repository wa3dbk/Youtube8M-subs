but if he doesn't let's just say he

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:31.489 
but if he doesn't let's just say he
stands<00:06:30.029> there<00:06:30.300> and<00:06:30.419> he<00:06:30.509> surveys<00:06:30.930> there<00:06:31.259> and

00:06:31.489 --> 00:06:31.499 
stands there and he surveys there and

00:06:31.499 --> 00:06:33.589 
stands there and he surveys there and
you<00:06:31.589> don't<00:06:31.769> see<00:06:31.979> what<00:06:32.159> he<00:06:32.249> wants<00:06:32.550> to<00:06:32.669> see<00:06:32.879> he

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:33.599 
you don't see what he wants to see he

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:35.869 
you don't see what he wants to see he
gets<00:06:33.809> suspicious<00:06:34.199> and<00:06:34.620> he<00:06:34.680> starts<00:06:35.129> walking

00:06:35.869 --> 00:06:35.879 
gets suspicious and he starts walking

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:38.420 
gets suspicious and he starts walking
off<00:06:36.349> well<00:06:37.349> in<00:06:37.499> that<00:06:37.649> case<00:06:37.919> you<00:06:38.099> can<00:06:38.249> just

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.430 
off well in that case you can just

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.999 
off well in that case you can just
either<00:06:38.580> let<00:06:38.879> him<00:06:38.999> walk<00:06:39.209> off<00:06:39.509> not<00:06:40.050> risking<00:06:40.860> him

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:41.009 
either let him walk off not risking him

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:42.590 
either let him walk off not risking him
but<00:06:41.189> I<00:06:41.399> recommend<00:06:41.939> getting

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.600 
but I recommend getting

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.210 
but I recommend getting
little<00:06:42.780> aggressive<00:06:42.870> and<00:06:43.380> swinging<00:06:43.740> on<00:06:44.040> him

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.220 
little aggressive and swinging on him

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.890 
little aggressive and swinging on him
and<00:06:44.430> just<00:06:44.970> you<00:06:45.270> know<00:06:45.510> rolling<00:06:47.510> when<00:06:48.510> you<00:06:48.630> get

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 
and just you know rolling when you get

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.660 
and just you know rolling when you get
the<00:06:49.020> shot<00:06:49.290> and<00:06:49.740> the<00:06:50.700> way<00:06:50.850> you<00:06:50.910> want<00:06:51.180> to<00:06:51.270> do<00:06:51.450> that

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:52.670 
the shot and the way you want to do that

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.700 
the shot and the way you want to do that
you'd<00:06:53.670> only<00:06:53.820> go<00:06:54.120> too<00:06:54.180> slow<00:06:54.600> in<00:06:54.840> that<00:06:54.870> situation

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:55.710 
you'd only go too slow in that situation

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.010 
you'd only go too slow in that situation
if<00:06:56.340> you<00:06:56.550> go<00:06:56.730> too<00:06:56.790> slow<00:06:57.000> he's<00:06:57.600> going<00:06:57.840> to<00:06:57.900> be

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 
if you go too slow he's going to be

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.350 
if you go too slow he's going to be
walked<00:06:58.290> out<00:06:58.830> of<00:06:58.890> range<00:06:59.310> before<00:06:59.670> you<00:07:00.000> ever<00:07:00.120> get

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 
walked out of range before you ever get

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.420 
walked out of range before you ever get
on<00:07:00.540> it<00:07:00.720> you<00:07:01.410> don't<00:07:01.500> want<00:07:01.590> to<00:07:01.770> try<00:07:01.950> to<00:07:02.010> be<00:07:02.190> real

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:02.430 
on it you don't want to try to be real

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:03.320 
on it you don't want to try to be real
quick<00:07:02.730> about<00:07:03.060> it

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:03.330 
quick about it

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.590 
quick about it
turkeys<00:07:03.660> catch<00:07:04.230> quick<00:07:04.710> movements<00:07:05.550> and<00:07:05.790> they<00:07:06.150> I

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:06.600 
turkeys catch quick movements and they I

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.510 
turkeys catch quick movements and they I
think<00:07:06.960> they<00:07:07.110> relate<00:07:07.470> them<00:07:07.650> to<00:07:07.680> a<00:07:07.860> bobcat

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:08.520 
think they relate them to a bobcat

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.460 
think they relate them to a bobcat
attacking<00:07:09.150> or<00:07:09.270> something<00:07:09.600> such<00:07:09.780> as<00:07:09.810> that<00:07:10.170> and

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:10.470 
attacking or something such as that and

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:13.490 
attacking or something such as that and
uh<00:07:10.730> that<00:07:11.730> makes<00:07:12.000> them<00:07:12.270> react<00:07:12.660> real<00:07:12.990> fast<00:07:13.260> you

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:13.500 
uh that makes them react real fast you

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.520 
uh that makes them react real fast you
just<00:07:13.710> want<00:07:13.920> to<00:07:13.980> take<00:07:14.220> a<00:07:14.250> natural<00:07:15.050> swing<00:07:16.050> just

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:32.460 
you first start your movement you expect

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.810 
you first start your movement you expect
him<00:07:32.850> to<00:07:33.320> raise<00:07:34.320> his<00:07:34.560> head<00:07:34.740> and<00:07:34.800> then<00:07:35.670> he's

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:35.820 
him to raise his head and then he's

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.090 
him to raise his head and then he's
going<00:07:35.970> to<00:07:36.030> say<00:07:36.810> hey<00:07:36.990> you<00:07:37.050> know<00:07:37.470> that's

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:39.180 
something I don't like he's going to

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.810 
something I don't like he's going to
raise<00:07:39.360> his<00:07:39.570> head<00:07:39.720> even<00:07:39.990> higher<00:07:40.140> and<00:07:40.710> then<00:07:41.670> he's

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:41.820 
raise his head even higher and then he's

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:43.250 
raise his head even higher and then he's
going<00:07:42.000> to<00:07:42.060> start<00:07:42.330> getting<00:07:42.540> out<00:07:42.810> of<00:07:42.960> there<00:07:43.140> and

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:43.260 
going to start getting out of there and

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.730 
going to start getting out of there and
a<00:07:43.320> lot<00:07:43.440> of<00:07:43.500> times<00:07:43.830> they<00:07:44.780> won't<00:07:45.780> break<00:07:46.140> off<00:07:46.410> into

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:46.740 
a lot of times they won't break off into

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.280 
a lot of times they won't break off into
a<00:07:46.890> real<00:07:47.250> fast<00:07:47.670> run<00:07:48.210> they'll<00:07:48.780> just<00:07:48.990> start

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:49.290 
a real fast run they'll just start

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:51.860 
a real fast run they'll just start
trotting<00:07:49.830> off<00:07:49.980> and<00:07:50.400> he<00:07:51.030> still<00:07:51.300> got<00:07:51.420> plenty<00:07:51.630> of

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:51.870 
trotting off and he still got plenty of

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:54.320 
trotting off and he still got plenty of
time<00:07:52.110> to<00:07:52.140> swing<00:07:52.560> on<00:07:52.740> around<00:07:53.040> get<00:07:53.760> on<00:07:53.790> him<00:07:54.150> and

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:54.330 
time to swing on around get on him and

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.410 
time to swing on around get on him and
before<00:07:54.450> he<00:07:54.750> gets<00:07:54.930> out<00:07:55.110> of<00:07:55.140> range<00:07:56.120> put<00:07:57.120> a<00:07:57.150> load

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:57.420 
before he gets out of range put a load

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.780 
before he gets out of range put a load
of<00:07:57.630> forwards<00:07:58.500> in<00:07:58.620> the<00:07:58.710> back<00:07:58.860> of<00:07:59.040> his<00:07:59.130> head<00:07:59.580> but

00:07:59.780 --> 00:07:59.790 
of forwards in the back of his head but

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:02.150 
of forwards in the back of his head but
if<00:08:00.330> he<00:08:00.480> does<00:08:00.660> just<00:08:00.960> brake<00:08:01.230> take<00:08:01.560> off<00:08:01.740> at<00:08:01.920> a<00:08:01.980> real

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:02.160 
if he does just brake take off at a real

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.150 
if he does just brake take off at a real
fast<00:08:02.430> run<00:08:02.820> you<00:08:03.780> don't<00:08:04.080> probably<00:08:04.770> don't<00:08:05.040> need

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:05.160 
fast run you don't probably don't need

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.660 
fast run you don't probably don't need
to<00:08:05.220> take<00:08:05.460> that<00:08:05.700> shot<00:08:05.940> just<00:08:06.270> let<00:08:06.480> him<00:08:06.600> go<00:08:07.400> if<00:08:08.400> the
