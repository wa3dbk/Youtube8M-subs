00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:05.449

 violin virtuoso david garrett is now 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.490
 to see on the big screen 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:21.350
 In his acting debut, he embodies 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.929
 none other than nicolo paganini 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:27.100
 the most famous violinist of the 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:31.420
 nineteenth century 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.920
 in the vicious violin prescribes you 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.150
 and you are from Rome so far 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.200

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:40.060
 this is the world in the storm especially 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.650
 Exciting a paganini I find that 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.050
 rumored by his pact with the devil 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.140
 which he allegedly so successful 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.140
 has been 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:54.030
 he did not invent that image that 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.030
 was always pressed 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.320
 I believe that right in the 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.120
 romantic time has been easy 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.880
 to stamp someone 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.060
 especially if someone is extraordinary 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.060
 was 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:25.160
 has certainly completed it and 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.990
 that also does not deny I believe that 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.110
 that made him a piece far fun 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.110

 pagani lima the first rock star 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.850
 that must have been really exciting 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.450
 this man then live on stage 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.460
 experience 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:53.310
 that is exactly what I want to feel 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:58.130
 the audience communicates with our film 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.130
