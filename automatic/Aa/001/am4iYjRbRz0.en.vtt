00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:17.529
 hello friends thank you for watching my videos 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:20.200
 are this time I have come with three 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:22.180
 super nail painting models 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.369
 colorful and I hope you like it so 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.779
 if you want to see how you can paint the 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.580
 sign in this way please follow 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.740
 seeing 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:34.180
 I would like to apologize for not uploading 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.660
 or that like two weeks videos of 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.450
 exams 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.489
 it's super complicated when one is in 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.330
 exams because he has full theory that is 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.360
 amanecerse doing exercises study 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:51.629
 jobs and full things that one 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.180
 it irritates that a skill so my best 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.940
 advice is always to stay well 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.850
 fed well one or that is the 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.699
 people that I love to sleep because the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.379
 best option would be I do not know how to get up early or 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.479
 get up in the morning breakfast and 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.509
 keep sleeping but do not forget 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.149
 I also cut my hair is perfect 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.640
 the good truth before starting the 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.789
 exams I wanted to try something new 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.800
 because it's always pretty good more than 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:22.020
 take a chance and I do not know about having a look 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.869
 different the pretty ones feel good with 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.990
 my movement something new from time to time 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:31.830
 when it does not hurt but it is also 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:36.020
 healthy self - esteem and 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.020
 that if this is my new part of hair 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.420
 I hope you like me the truth 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.910
 loved it because as I always say 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.870
 had long and good hair from time 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:53.050
 in when to cut it a little bit good 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.380
 so let's continue with the painting of 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.380
 nail 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.300
 after the enamel has been removed 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.490
 of the previous painting have animated the 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.410
 nails and put on a coat of enamel 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.990
 Transparent to last more 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:11.390
 current painting we will do it always 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.940
 on the nail we will put different 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.000
 random colors making sure that 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.560
 cover all the space between enamel 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.590
 you can use your favorite colors 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.870
 preferably clear for that contrast 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.240
 with the dark layer that we will place more 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.570
 ahead 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:31.540
 we cut pieces of very thin ribbons if 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:34.090
 they wish in zig zag waves lines or their 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.790
 preference what we will do is stick 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.700
 on the nails once the layer of 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.830
 colored enamel this jacek this 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.470
 will prevent damage to the painting and its 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.620
 instead it will stick much easier for 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.320
 is the design defined once 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.190
 placed the pieces of tape we will put 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.420
 a layer of black enamel on the nails 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.540
 making sure that it covers all 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.200
 spaces for smaller than it is 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.580
 finally when this polish is dry 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.720
 we remove the tapes and so it will remain 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.720
 our first design 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.939
 i 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.120
 i 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.130
 for the second painted we will repeat the 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.289
 same previous procedure 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:08.680
 referring to the colorful lower layer 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:11.889
 once this layer is dry with a 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:14.279
 fine finite brush we will place enamel 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:17.199
 black and we will paint over the colors 

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:19.719
 giving it the shape of lines similar to the 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:23.189
 of a zebra and if this is our 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:23.189
 second design completed 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.180
 for the final design we will place a 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.389
 thin layer of black enamel throughout 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.920
 a 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:45.980
 using light colors for the 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:48.860
 contrast we will paint curved lines from 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:51.770
 the top of the nail and at the end 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:54.960
 a ball using the edge of it 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:58.139
 brush all the same color 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.600
 we will practice this same technique throughout 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:01.860
 the nail using different colors of 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.600
 enamel 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:07.389
 finally we will turn out with enamel 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:10.930
 black the edges of each painted drop 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:13.980
 separating them from each other and so it is 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:16.490
 our third finished design 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.490
 and 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:59.020
