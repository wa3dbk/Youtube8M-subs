00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
asked me about the degree to which

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.720 
asked me about the degree to which

same sort of verbal abilities where

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.660 
same sort of verbal abilities where

language acquisition abilities that

language acquisition abilities that
humans<00:03:08.849> have<00:03:09.239> well<00:03:09.689> the<00:03:09.780> key<00:03:09.989> thing<00:03:10.290> is<00:03:10.319> to<00:03:10.739> try

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
humans have well the key thing is to try

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.830 
humans have well the key thing is to try
to<00:03:10.950> teach<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.579> dog<00:03:11.790> two<00:03:12.510> concepts<00:03:14.599> one<00:03:15.599> is

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
to teach the dog two concepts one is

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.569 
to teach the dog two concepts one is
knowledge<00:03:17.750> objects<00:03:18.750> have<00:03:18.870> names<00:03:19.400> but<00:03:20.400> then

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
knowledge objects have names but then

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:25.160 
knowledge objects have names but then
the<00:03:21.420> dog<00:03:21.629> needs<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:22.170> learn<00:03:22.319> some<00:03:23.239> cue<00:03:24.239> as<00:03:24.569> the

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
the dog needs to learn some cue as the

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.930 
the dog needs to learn some cue as the
house<00:03:25.430> we<00:03:26.690> connect<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:28.230> words<00:03:28.470> with<00:03:29.069> the

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
house we connect the words with the

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.530 
house we connect the words with the
object<00:03:30.650> so<00:03:31.650> that<00:03:31.829> the<00:03:31.950> dog<00:03:32.129> has<00:03:32.340> to<00:03:32.370> know<00:03:32.730> what

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
object so that the dog has to know what

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.069 
object so that the dog has to know what
particular<00:03:33.900> object<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.709> words<00:03:34.950> refer<00:03:35.549> to<00:03:36.079> and

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
particular object the words refer to and

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.520 
particular object the words refer to and
our<00:03:37.290> procedure<00:03:37.680> was<00:03:37.889> just<00:03:38.099> very<00:03:38.310> simple<00:03:39.530> we

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
our procedure was just very simple we

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.039 
our procedure was just very simple we
simply<00:03:40.920> held<00:03:41.579> an<00:03:41.760> object<00:03:42.150> before<00:03:42.510> holding<00:03:42.780> it

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
simply held an object before holding it

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.009 
simply held an object before holding it
in<00:03:43.170> our<00:03:43.319> hand<00:03:43.620> saying<00:03:43.920> this<00:03:44.190> is<00:03:44.810> this<00:03:45.810> is

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
in our hand saying this is this is

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:51.890 
in our hand saying this is this is
rabbit<00:03:46.790> I'm<00:03:47.790> going<00:03:48.090> to<00:03:48.209> hide<00:03:48.389> rabbit<00:03:50.629> so<00:03:51.629> then

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
rabbit I'm going to hide rabbit so then

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.319 
rabbit I'm going to hide rabbit so then
we<00:03:52.049> get<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.410> rabbit<00:03:52.829> and<00:03:53.129> then<00:03:53.370> while<00:03:54.030> she's

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
we get the rabbit and then while she's

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.250 
we get the rabbit and then while she's
looking<00:03:54.569> for<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.620> rabbit<00:03:56.040> we're<00:03:56.879> using

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
looking for the rabbit we're using

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.860 
looking for the rabbit we're using
associations<00:03:58.260> of<00:03:58.560> the<00:03:58.590> name<00:03:58.919> and<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.370> objects

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
associations of the name and the objects

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.629 
associations of the name and the objects
tasted<00:04:00.870> fine<00:04:01.169> rabbit<00:04:01.910> fine<00:04:02.910> revered<00:04:03.419> and<00:04:04.639> my

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
tasted fine rabbit fine revered and my

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.580 
tasted fine rabbit fine revered and my
theory<00:04:05.910> is<00:04:06.180> that's<00:04:06.629> that<00:04:06.900> while<00:04:07.169> she<00:04:07.440> was

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
theory is that's that while she was

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.599 
theory is that's that while she was
searching<00:04:07.859> for<00:04:08.099> the<00:04:08.310> rabbit<00:04:10.129> somehow<00:04:11.129> another

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
searching for the rabbit somehow another

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.300 
searching for the rabbit somehow another
that<00:04:11.849> were<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.629> main<00:04:12.840> stayed<00:04:13.620> in<00:04:13.799> her<00:04:13.949> memory

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
that were the main stayed in her memory

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.120 
that were the main stayed in her memory
I<00:04:14.639> don't<00:04:15.629> know<00:04:15.720> for<00:04:16.169> sure<00:04:16.199> but<00:04:16.680> I'm<00:04:16.859> pretty

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
I don't know for sure but I'm pretty

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.560 
I don't know for sure but I'm pretty
sure<00:04:17.930> so<00:04:18.930> that<00:04:19.169> put<00:04:19.380> there<00:04:19.560> spanned<00:04:20.010> a<00:04:20.570> few

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
sure so that put there spanned a few

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.680 
sure so that put there spanned a few
minutes<00:04:21.959> the<00:04:22.860> name<00:04:23.099> of<00:04:23.729> the<00:04:24.000> object<00:04:24.449> and<00:04:24.599> the

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
minutes the name of the object and the

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.750 
minutes the name of the object and the
actual<00:04:25.050> object<00:04:25.409> itself<00:04:25.500> was<00:04:26.130> being<00:04:26.370> paired

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
actual object itself was being paired

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.390 
actual object itself was being paired
and<00:04:27.120> this<00:04:27.990> is<00:04:28.169> good<00:04:28.380> old<00:04:28.500> classical

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
and this is good old classical

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.300 
and this is good old classical
conditioning<00:04:29.760> and<00:04:30.620> somewhere<00:04:31.620> along<00:04:31.919> the<00:04:32.159> way

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
conditioning and somewhere along the way

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.939 
conditioning and somewhere along the way
the<00:04:33.060> hypothesis<00:04:33.810> is<00:04:34.050> it's<00:04:34.349> somewhere<00:04:34.710> along

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
the hypothesis is it's somewhere along

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:38.029 
the hypothesis is it's somewhere along
the<00:04:35.190> way<00:04:35.220> after<00:04:36.060> those<00:04:36.389> many<00:04:36.889> objects<00:04:37.889> that

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:38.039 
the way after those many objects that

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:41.140 
the way after those many objects that
she<00:04:38.250> was<00:04:38.400> learning<00:04:38.810> there<00:04:39.810> was<00:04:40.130> this

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
she was learning there was this

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.210 
she was learning there was this
inference<00:04:42.150> of<00:04:43.159> objects<00:04:44.159> have<00:04:44.370> names

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
inference of objects have names

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.220 
inference of objects have names
and<00:04:45.790> when<00:04:46.240> I<00:04:46.590> say<00:04:47.590> this<00:04:47.980> is<00:04:48.720> then<00:04:49.720> that's<00:04:49.960> the

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
and when I say this is then that's the

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.010 
and when I say this is then that's the
cue<00:04:50.530> that<00:04:51.100> helps<00:04:51.400> her<00:04:51.520> to<00:04:51.550> identify<00:04:51.880> the<00:04:52.210> name

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
cue that helps her to identify the name

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.320 
cue that helps her to identify the name
with<00:04:53.350> the<00:04:53.500> object<00:04:53.920> then<00:04:54.580> we<00:04:54.610> created<00:04:55.210> the

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
with the object then we created the

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.800 
with the object then we created the
specific<00:04:55.990> design<00:04:56.170> and<00:04:57.060> followed<00:04:58.060> some<00:04:58.300> free

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810

well what exclusive learning

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:38.990 
well what exclusive learning
demonstrates<00:06:36.930> is<00:06:37.199> that<00:06:37.229> the<00:06:37.530> dog<00:06:37.740> learns<00:06:38.610> the

demonstrates is that the dog learns the
