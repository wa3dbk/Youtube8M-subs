00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:12.620

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.570

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:31.510
 Hello, welcome no latte to me 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.510

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:57.210
 the wefa and frank the max one and 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:00.810
 I want to read from me and behind you 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:04.370

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:11.310

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:16.550
 he looks similar to me is green and a 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.550
 water elementary love greetings carver 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.979
 then let's have a look at the market 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.430
 So first people smoke no water 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.430
 elements 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.540
 that is not a water element either 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.290
 The animals do not take in the water 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.120
 we have the night open 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.230
 Thank you 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.800
 you will like it here 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.720
 a 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:45.940
 Hello, welcome to change I am 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:52.210
 and I will ask a bit now 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:54.100
 to the crocodile may be so ask 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.600
 our crocodile that can be around 78 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:02.050
 meters are already saying today 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:04.240
 big so we actually eat 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.280
 all he gets pre-maul at but 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.680
 Specially a dead rabbit gets us 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:13.390
 once a week or chicken 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:15.670
 but only once a week 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.020
 it can be very difficult to correct 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.220
 So almost a tonne 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.360
 is subject to about 430 kilo 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:29.080
 a little bit there is also the 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:32.080
 fully grown not measured 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.260
 a school flinc so as a human being has there 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.640
 do you have no chance 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.020
 certainly not there is still much 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.250
 more quickly 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.330
 Water is an element of course 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:46.920
 best well and then can also on 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:49.360
 The fastest moving teeth are already 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.190
 curious in those is yes had the teeth 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.020
 he only to hold on to the booty 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.490
 break off easily as you do with you 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.470
 example the possible the dramatic 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.020
 break out because the children have to 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:05.070
 the profit is also the 10 o'clock to the 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:05.070
 hold on and then I'm to the 4th 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.220
 So come among travelers for example 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.599
 has a relatively large one 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.160
 So distribution area comes from 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:17.560
 australia to southeast asia may well so 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.060
 to swim across the sea that is called the 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.859
 flood level because it's easy 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.020
 possibility to swim over the sea 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:27.020
 Now in time to swim because that 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.940
 open sum added a salt dose 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.330
 since are excreted what others 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.330
 Not 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:38.090
 So you say you can correct that way 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.840
 So about 100 years old are our 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:46.150
 is now 58 years old so he can still 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.150
 a bit grow a bit 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.570
 hmm
