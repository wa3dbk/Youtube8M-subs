00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:12.730
 and now is the time for you 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.920
 to present new also at dynastar 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.020
 which should make a lot of noise on 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.140
 park crack 89 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.870
 the skippers stalking at dynastar are going 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.640
 come replace the heartland series which 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:27.490
 had a lot of success 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.050
 but evolution requires one must always 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.360
 brought new marketing concepts 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:35.260
 so we come with his words stalking 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:38.020
 which will end up in 89 mm on the skate 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.270
 for expert skiing that is going to 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.280
 to find in 84 mm to the skate for scar 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.340
 intermediary to experts and who will 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.510
 find after in 79 for less skiing 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.960
 dear what more beginners 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.930
 with a fixation look in all three 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.600
 body in the case of the 89 dynastar we're going 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.930
 sell it without a fixing plate for 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.070
 to be able to go sightseeing 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.649
 but of the six were the marks that 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.030
 put us on downhill buttocks 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:08.070
 but when he gets in that ski 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.350
 of experts a classic construction of 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.539
 high performance ski with as we have 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.729
 often at dynastar deschamps is a 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:18.420
 laminated wood core with a wafer 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.670
 italy and in the blood are 19 cm in 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.860
 before a radius of 10 meters radius 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.810
 so for a 90-wide ski that's 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.009
 still quite short as rays this 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.470
 who still promises us beautiful 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.179
 things a lot of good feelings about 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.470
 the ski slopes recognize you very 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:37.470
 probably a little bit the the fom type and 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.140
 than cham skis which are the ski of 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.720
 freeride artists search the range 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.990
 dynastar so we have a little marriage 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.240
 between the cham freeride series and the range 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.789
 crown that we tried last year on 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.129
 track which is a pure ski track and which 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.440
 was extremely effective and pleasant to 

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:57.479
 to ski on the track and we say a lot of 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.280
 things of good skis rooms whose 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.200
 suits with a combination of 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.590
 two to arrive with a ski the 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.600
 look 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.600
 we can really be done with 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.569
 tale radius large radius wines rays 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.200
 this is a great radius of magnitude 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.120
 Quebec 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.950
 how they see this ski is good on 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.650
 will have inscribed with a classic camber 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.349
 a bit like a giant slalom under the 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.239
 boot with a tech rocker 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.319
 that is to say the spatula raised for 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.780
 facilitate his turn 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:32.110
 we will also make it easier to turn 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.510
 because the ski even if it is 10 cm 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.060
 radius in total we end up seeing at 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.519
 different points 5 different 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.370
 size of the rays on the ski so 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.930
 depending on the degree of camber that 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.400
 we come to live in the ski 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.980
 while we did our bends 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.540
 the pressure that the last is applied there 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.549
 caen will go to different places on 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.989
 the style of meaning that if it earth exchange 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.590
 if we have not necessarily placed at 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.480
 good place 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.730
 skiing will be able to engage 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.739
 somewhere his agreement to go 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.030
 release very easily at the back 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.310
 because you will notice that we are a 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.680
 little bit wider at this point here for 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.970
 then cleared the exit very easily 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.200
 of the turn so a ski that go when 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.790
 even good forgive powerful pleasant 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.450
 which should give us good 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.299
 sensations 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.049
 that's what we are told we ski 80% 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.700
 track 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.480
 so it's you skiing to play 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.370
 always in the wood is a 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.690
 to the massive was always in the under 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.269
 wood maybe it's not what for 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.420
 you but if you make 80% track then 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:33.060
 after that 20% off-piste undergrowth 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.700
 the bosses even thwarted in the park itself 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.489
 if it's not a ski and wendake at this 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.319
 moment that's your what of course and 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.269
 adidas genetic peculiarities 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.879
 always very light a lot of 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:47.910
 ski sensations that provide a lot 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:51.090
 of pleasure so in the range 2015 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.099
 the new ones by the trac 89 for 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.629
 the expert and the other two declensions 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.489
 for skiers who will be less 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:04:00.980
 performance is what our stars say
