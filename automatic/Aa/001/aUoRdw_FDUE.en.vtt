think almost like forty dollars and I

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.650 
think almost like forty dollars and I
wasn't<00:00:59.670> sure<00:00:59.820> where<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.149> was<00:01:00.270> gonna<00:01:00.390> wear<00:01:00.629> it

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
wasn't sure where I was gonna wear it

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.599 
wasn't sure where I was gonna wear it
but<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:00.960> wanted<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.410> get<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.160> bad<00:01:02.340> this<00:01:02.550> looks

would be perfect because it's a little

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.109 
would be perfect because it's a little
bit<00:01:07.260> dramatical<00:01:08.250> German<00:01:08.790> drag<00:01:09.320> aticle
