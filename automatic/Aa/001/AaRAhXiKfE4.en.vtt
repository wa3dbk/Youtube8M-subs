here<00:01:24.130> little<00:01:25.130> bit<00:01:25.220> of<00:01:25.340> rust<00:01:25.549> on<00:01:26.409> here<00:01:28.090> they're

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
here little bit of rust on here they're

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:36.480 
here little bit of rust on here they're
bubbling<00:01:29.360> over<00:01:29.780> here<00:01:32.920> rear<00:01:33.920> side<00:01:34.780> generally

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
bubbling over here rear side generally

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.130 
bubbling over here rear side generally
okay<00:01:37.490> there's<00:01:37.820> less<00:01:38.030> rust<00:01:38.570> around<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:38.990> wheel

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
okay there's less rust around the wheel

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.749 
okay there's less rust around the wheel
arch<00:01:39.380> here<00:01:39.740> fairly<00:01:40.430> free<00:01:40.729> of<00:01:40.850> rust<00:01:42.759> your

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
there's a lot of mottling under there

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:02.080 
there's a lot of mottling under there
and<00:01:57.710> have<00:01:57.830> a<00:01:57.860> look<00:01:58.009> at<00:01:58.100> this<00:01:58.220> way<00:02:00.970> there's<00:02:01.970> some

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
rust around front wheel arches quick

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.750 
rust around front wheel arches quick
look<00:02:58.549> inside<00:02:59.549> if<00:03:00.090> you<00:03:00.150> like<00:03:02.449> here<00:03:03.449> we<00:03:03.510> go<00:03:03.719> and

look inside if you like here we go and
probably<00:03:05.760> do<00:03:05.939> with<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.090> bit<00:03:06.209> of<00:03:06.299> a<00:03:06.359> clean<00:03:06.599> to<00:03:06.780> be

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
probably do with a bit of a clean to be

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.199 
probably do with a bit of a clean to be
honest<00:03:08.569> but<00:03:09.569> what<00:03:10.169> I<00:03:10.199> came<00:03:10.439> here<00:03:10.579> for<00:03:11.579> to

honest but what I came here for to

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.390 
honest but what I came here for to
mention<00:03:12.689> the<00:03:13.230> central<00:03:13.590> locking<00:03:13.769> isn't

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
mention the central locking isn't

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.289 
mention the central locking isn't
working

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.870 

I'll<00:03:18.299> leave<00:03:18.479> it<00:03:18.569> there<00:03:18.689> for<00:03:18.840> now
