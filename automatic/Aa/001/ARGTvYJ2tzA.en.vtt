if<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:36.299> use<00:01:36.570> bones<00:01:36.929> you're<00:01:37.320> gonna<00:01:37.409> have<00:01:37.619> to

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
if you use bones you're gonna have to

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.830 
if you use bones you're gonna have to
boil<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.159> for<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.399> much<00:01:38.579> longer<00:01:38.939> time<00:01:39.179> like

around<00:01:40.079> three<00:01:40.380> hours<00:01:41.869> after<00:01:42.869> an<00:01:43.619> hour<00:01:43.799> of

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
around three hours after an hour of

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.260 
around three hours after an hour of

add the meat back in and simmer for
about<00:01:48.090> another<00:01:49.159> because<00:01:50.159> pork<00:01:50.520> can<00:01:50.670> be<00:01:50.789> very

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
about another because pork can be very

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.270 
about another because pork can be very
fatty<00:01:51.330> try<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.140> skim<00:01:52.380> off<00:01:52.560> as<00:01:52.799> much<00:01:53.039> as<00:01:53.159> the

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
fatty try and skim off as much as the

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.039 
fatty try and skim off as much as the
oil<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.729> fast<00:01:53.939> as<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.179> can<00:01:54.390> off<00:01:54.539> the<00:01:54.569> surface

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.850 
oil and fast as you can off the surface
of<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.289> soup<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:57.110> that's<00:01:58.110> pretty<00:01:58.409> much<00:01:58.560> it

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
of the soup and that's pretty much it

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.859 
of the soup and that's pretty much it
it's<00:01:59.099> definitely<00:01:59.759> one<00:02:00.209> of<00:02:00.240> my<00:02:00.420> favorite

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869
