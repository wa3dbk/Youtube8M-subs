00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.350 
mess with any of this and the guy who
made<00:02:03.899> this<00:02:04.259> it's<00:02:04.829> like<00:02:05.159> chainfire<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:05.909> think

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
made this it's like chainfire I think

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.419 
made this it's like chainfire I think
all<00:02:07.020> leaves<00:02:07.409> name<00:02:07.649> in<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.829> description<00:02:08.310> and

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
all leaves name in the description and

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.430 
all leaves name in the description and
all<00:02:08.550> that<00:02:08.759> but<00:02:09.539> he's<00:02:09.720> pretty<00:02:09.869> cool<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.410> guess

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
all that but he's pretty cool I guess

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.309 
all that but he's pretty cool I guess
he's<00:02:11.069> made<00:02:11.580> makes<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.300> lot<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.510> Android

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
he's made makes a lot of Android

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.649 
he's made makes a lot of Android
hacks<00:02:13.469> and<00:02:13.739> stuff<00:02:13.950> like<00:02:14.069> that<00:02:14.129> and<00:02:14.659> exploits

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
hacks and stuff like that and exploits

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.589 
hacks and stuff like that and exploits
so<00:02:16.560> pretty<00:02:16.799> much<00:02:16.920> we<00:02:17.249> have<00:02:17.489> PA<00:02:17.819> checked<00:02:18.180> off<00:02:18.329> to

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
so pretty much we have PA checked off to

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.289 
so pretty much we have PA checked off to
where<00:02:18.749> it's<00:02:19.129> cf-auto-root<00:02:20.129> is<00:02:20.459> downloaded<00:02:20.909> so

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
where it's cf-auto-root is downloaded so

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:22.699 
where it's cf-auto-root is downloaded so
now<00:02:21.420> sets<00:02:21.659> added<00:02:21.959> so<00:02:22.139> I'm<00:02:22.319> going<00:02:22.469> to<00:02:22.499> put<00:02:22.560> my

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
now sets added so I'm going to put my

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.800 
now sets added so I'm going to put my
device<00:02:23.069> side<00:02:23.310> by<00:02:23.459> side<00:02:23.639> and<00:02:24.239> we're<00:02:24.540> just<00:02:24.629> can

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
device side by side and we're just can

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.229 
device side by side and we're just can
hit<00:02:24.959> start<00:02:25.819> so<00:02:27.829> okay<00:02:28.829> setting<00:02:29.700> up<00:02:29.790> connection

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
hit start so okay setting up connection

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.849 
hit start so okay setting up connection
and<00:02:30.480> now<00:02:30.689> we<00:02:30.750> can<00:02:30.930> see<00:02:31.049> a<00:02:31.079> little<00:02:31.230> progress<00:02:31.530> bar

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:31.859 
and now we can see a little progress bar

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.550 
and now we can see a little progress bar
right<00:02:32.010> here<00:02:32.239> so<00:02:33.239> I<00:02:33.269> tried<00:02:33.689> this<00:02:33.810> on<00:02:33.959> my<00:02:34.109> Mac<00:02:34.319> in

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
right here so I tried this on my Mac in

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.069 
right here so I tried this on my Mac in
it<00:02:34.769> wouldn't<00:02:34.920> really<00:02:35.099> work<00:02:35.250> for<00:02:35.430> me<00:02:35.670> so<00:02:36.150> I'm

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
it wouldn't really work for me so I'm

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.080 
it wouldn't really work for me so I'm
doing<00:02:37.500> it<00:02:37.620> actually<00:02:37.889> on<00:02:37.980> windows<00:02:38.280> as<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:39.000> can

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
doing it actually on windows as you can

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.330 
doing it actually on windows as you can
see<00:02:39.329> so<00:02:39.659> that's<00:02:40.139> why<00:02:40.469> I'm<00:02:40.620> doing<00:02:40.799> our<00:02:41.040> windows

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
see so that's why I'm doing our windows

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.920 
see so that's why I'm doing our windows
and<00:02:41.519> not<00:02:41.609> on<00:02:41.700> my<00:02:41.819> back<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.530> stuff<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:44.930> it
