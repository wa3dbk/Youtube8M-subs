00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:24.869
 And then everyone here is talking about beauty. 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.359
 maicon that already bring you one more 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.050
 video and this video I decided to bring 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.270
 there an excellent program that I liked 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.719
 much there is this problem that has been bringing 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.829
 is the same manufacturer of the proof against itself 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:44.190
 in my previous video it 's from mz it 's on my 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.710
 elec voter program 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.739
 the name already says everything, the name already says 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.719
 that this program accelerates gamers 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.940
 this program and it does a series of 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.460
 changes to the operating system that 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.469
 we have reduced the resources used for a 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.410
 recommended number and improving the 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.539
 computer performance everything without everything is 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.010
 all without major user reinforcements 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.320
 how are you going to need to do anything on 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.420
 just a click will you do 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.270
 changes to your computer that will 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.860
 facilitate and optimize your games 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.740
 good so if you have some should go out 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.880
 See what the hell is not working? 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.350
 play your games from catching 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.049
 so you use this program and it will 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.960
 improve enough and will not optimize 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.970
 the game not only your game but also your 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.950
 Praça 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.110
 the unique download for this program 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.780
 which is in the video description is the 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.210
 download and install usually does not have 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.730
 no problem and play to installed 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.960
 open the program there 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.420
 they have this small interface here 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.970
 You can not appear with this color. 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.590
 because I found the theme that then 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:59.640
 can also be taking out any theme 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:02.880
 It's just nice to be here. 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.480
 As you can see, it comes with four 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:10.070
 available options in aac 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:16.230
 the first of these is temporary stop at 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:18.360
 has acquired the services is to 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.940
 interrupt window processes 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.310
 that are not being used 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.910
 when the game is running 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.970
 this second here smart little too much is 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:34.290
 which is responsible for optimizing 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:38.310
 memory resources Rams pitcher this 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.500
 third, it causes the game to be 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.650
 fed with more features of the 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:47.850
 processor than with other applications 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:53.100
 its processor is will give the gas by the 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:54.959
 your game and the latter does the inverse of 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.709
 all of the above option 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.450
 taking resources from other programs 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.430
 so its pretty cool program is very 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.720
 easy to use 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:10.560
 to activate these options if you click here 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:12.690
 and it will activate and remember there that 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.170
 Do you have an air effect? 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:21.300
 disable why it turns off there 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:23.400
 to give a certain lightness and in your pc 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.100
 so if you have effect 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.080
 transparent activated then it goes 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:32.710
 disable and who 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:35.770
 São Paulo The video immediately after the video 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:40.630
 he has used there will appear a 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:44.980
 message here you go from ok it goes 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:49.900
 minimize and stents those who brake here 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:52.840
 good is the limit of game mode 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.250
 So you play your game, there you go. 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.470
 improve a lot 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:02.550
 if you want to return to normal without 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:06.220
 right click here and it fills suite 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:10.570
 normal way who will return to the 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:12.850
 and activate the air effect because it is 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.040
 a positive point of this software or 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:18.610
 I think it's cool, the security that he 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.359
 offers is unlike other 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.310
 Software 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.140
 this software and do not make changes 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.260
 which may jeopardize the operation 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:29.500
 but it's good to remember here 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:32.260
 mc game does not miracle south he only 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:36.030
 optimizes the operation of games in the 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:38.080
 computer but it will give enough 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.220
 optimization there you will feel the 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.430
 difference 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:45.340
 Okay, I hope you liked this.
