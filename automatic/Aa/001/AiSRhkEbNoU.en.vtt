00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:18.500 

this<00:00:11.360> seems<00:00:11.690> to<00:00:11.810> be

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:01:41.480 

the<00:00:18.990> tightening<00:00:19.470> method<00:00:19.800> is

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.130 

this<00:01:42.490> one's<00:01:42.700> actually<00:01:42.910> given<00:01:43.510> my<00:01:43.630> notes<00:01:43.930> a

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
this one's actually given my notes a

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.170 
this one's actually given my notes a
little<00:01:44.259> bit<00:01:44.470> more<00:01:44.619> power<00:01:45.009> tool<00:01:45.430> and<00:01:45.759> it's

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
little bit more power tool and it's

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.820 
little bit more power tool and it's
really<00:01:46.420> really<00:01:46.509> easy<00:01:46.899> to<00:01:47.110> place<00:01:47.290> always<00:01:47.560> free

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
really really easy to place always free

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.310 
really really easy to place always free
glowing<00:01:48.220> more<00:01:48.790> like<00:01:48.940> a<00:01:48.970> jazz<00:01:49.300> but<00:01:49.630> I<00:01:49.869> think

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
glowing more like a jazz but I think

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.290 
glowing more like a jazz but I think
they<00:01:50.410> designed<00:01:50.800> this<00:01:50.950> ligature<00:01:51.340> to<00:01:51.430> be<00:01:51.610> an<00:01:51.850> all

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
they designed this ligature to be an all

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.060 
they designed this ligature to be an all
arounder<00:01:52.810> get<00:01:52.930> straight<00:01:53.110> to<00:01:53.259> work<00:01:53.290> for<00:01:53.830> as

arounder get straight to work for as

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.880 
arounder get straight to work for as
many<00:01:54.700> genres<00:01:54.850> as<00:01:55.270> possible<00:01:55.869> kind<00:01:56.560> of<00:01:56.649> giving

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
many genres as possible kind of giving

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.810 
many genres as possible kind of giving
it<00:01:56.950> the<00:01:57.160> general<00:01:57.580> name<00:01:57.789> of<00:01:58.000> master<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:59.820> with

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
it the general name of master so with

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.700 
it the general name of master so with
that<00:02:00.970> being<00:02:01.149> said<00:02:01.270> we're<00:02:01.630> gonna<00:02:01.780> try<00:02:01.960> out<00:02:02.170> a

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
those custom Z's Murray's broken so I

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:09.100 
those custom Z's Murray's broken so I
don't<00:02:56.890> want

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:18.290 

put<00:03:10.110> you<00:03:10.260> guys<00:03:10.290> through<00:03:10.710> that<00:03:17.000> this<00:03:18.000> is<00:03:18.180> the

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
put you guys through that this is the

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.580 
put you guys through that this is the
tenor<00:03:18.570> of<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.960> e16<00:03:19.590> optimum<00:03:20.130> ligature<00:03:21.590> they

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
tenor of the e16 optimum ligature they

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.130 
tenor of the e16 optimum ligature they
made<00:03:22.770> a<00:03:22.800> v16<00:03:23.250> version<00:03:23.880> of<00:03:23.970> this<00:03:24.120> because<00:03:25.020> only

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
made a v16 version of this because only

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.760 
made a v16 version of this because only
out<00:03:25.410> so<00:03:25.620> it<00:03:25.770> just<00:03:25.920> says<00:03:27.320> optimum<00:03:28.320> the<00:03:28.470> good<00:03:28.590> job

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
out so it just says optimum the good job

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.860 
out so it just says optimum the good job
doesn't<00:03:29.370> say<00:03:29.490> v16<00:03:30.390> optimum<00:03:31.020> not<00:03:31.530> v16<00:03:32.100> Matthews

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
doesn't say v16 optimum not v16 Matthews

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:42.740 
doesn't say v16 optimum not v16 Matthews
so<00:03:36.050> but<00:03:40.640> maybe<00:03:41.640> that's<00:03:41.820> why<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.090> price<00:03:42.360> is<00:03:42.570> so

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
so but maybe that's why the price is so

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.220 
so but maybe that's why the price is so
low<00:03:42.780> so<00:03:43.260> be<00:03:43.770> 16<00:03:44.280> but<00:03:44.640> I<00:03:44.850> do<00:03:44.970> play<00:03:45.270> 3/16<00:03:45.870> on<00:03:46.020> both

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
low so be 16 but I do play 3/16 on both

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.550 
low so be 16 but I do play 3/16 on both
muffins<00:03:46.800> so<00:03:47.790> maybe<00:03:48.210> that<00:03:48.540> night<00:03:50.270> it<00:03:51.270> might<00:03:51.560> be

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
muffins so maybe that night it might be

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.610 
muffins so maybe that night it might be
desired<00:03:52.980> without<00:03:53.780> particular<00:03:54.780> mouthpiece<00:03:55.380> I

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
desired without particular mouthpiece I

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.890 
desired without particular mouthpiece I
don't<00:03:56.430> have<00:03:56.670> it<00:03:56.850> and<00:03:57.060> they<00:03:57.150> don't<00:03:57.360> sell<00:03:57.750> it

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
don't have it and they don't sell it

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.830 
don't have it and they don't sell it
with<00:03:58.170> it<00:03:58.380> so<00:03:58.650> I<00:03:58.680> guess<00:03:59.120> it<00:04:00.120> helps<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:00.450> prices

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
with it so I guess it helps the prices

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.970 
with it so I guess it helps the prices
out<00:04:02.180> I<00:04:03.180> give<00:04:03.900> the<00:04:04.050> optimum<00:04:04.470> ligature<00:04:04.770> with<00:04:04.890> the

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
out I give the optimum ligature with the

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.920 
out I give the optimum ligature with the
3<00:04:05.190> purser<00:04:05.520> places<00:04:05.850> have<00:04:06.030> merit<00:04:06.300> and<00:04:06.420> because

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
3 purser places have merit and because

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.030 
3 purser places have merit and because
of<00:04:06.960> the<00:04:07.320> simple<00:04:07.620> reason<00:04:07.680> that<00:04:10.160> kind<00:04:11.160> of<00:04:11.220> not<00:04:11.400> to

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
of the simple reason that kind of not to

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.979 
of the simple reason that kind of not to
satisfy<00:04:14.040> it<00:04:14.100> completely<00:04:15.090> you<00:04:15.540> would<00:04:15.690> think

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
satisfy it completely you would think

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.720 
satisfy it completely you would think
that<00:04:16.169> these<00:04:16.440> 3<00:04:16.709> first<00:04:16.980> place<00:04:17.220> would<00:04:17.370> give<00:04:17.549> you

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
that these 3 first place would give you

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.110 
that these 3 first place would give you
the<00:04:17.850> big<00:04:18.150> difference<00:04:18.570> but<00:04:18.720> it<00:04:18.840> doesn't<00:04:19.350> mean

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
the big difference but it doesn't mean

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.610 
the big difference but it doesn't mean
but<00:04:21.120> the<00:04:21.330> math<00:04:21.570> literature<00:04:21.989> was<00:04:22.260> actually

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
but the math literature was actually

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.010 
but the math literature was actually
pretty<00:04:23.070> good<00:04:23.160> ready<00:04:23.669> to<00:04:23.730> be<00:04:23.880> 1<00:04:24.180> Omega<00:04:24.510> 2<00:04:24.750> and

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
pretty good ready to be 1 Omega 2 and

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.950 
pretty good ready to be 1 Omega 2 and
not<00:04:25.710> 3<00:04:25.950> separate<00:04:26.490> the<00:04:26.610> cashews<00:04:26.910> and<00:04:27.180> that

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
not 3 separate the cashews and that

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:34.659 
not 3 separate the cashews and that
makes<00:04:28.169> sense<00:04:30.350> it<00:04:31.350> was<00:04:31.470> pretty<00:04:31.680> good<00:04:32.010> I<00:04:32.340> can't

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
makes sense it was pretty good I can't

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:48.440 
makes sense it was pretty good I can't
help<00:04:35.669> with<00:04:38.419> my<00:04:42.020> technique<00:04:45.110> so<00:04:46.110> I<00:04:47.240> will<00:04:48.240> give

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
help with my technique so I will give

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.090 
help with my technique so I will give
the<00:04:48.720> OP

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:05:01.160 

a<00:04:55.140> I'm<00:04:56.140> not<00:04:56.320> dropping<00:04:56.530> with<00:04:56.920> the<00:04:57.330> master<00:04:58.330> a

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:06.270 

point<00:05:02.170> five<00:05:02.410> eyes<00:05:03.900> just<00:05:04.900> because<00:05:05.350> of<00:05:05.740> I<00:05:06.070> think

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280
