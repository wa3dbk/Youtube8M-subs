00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 hi rene today i want you some more 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.259
 tell about the latest monet them 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.390
 to come from 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.130
 namely miracle locker and as one of 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.860
 the first in the netherlands looked at the scope of 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.519
 this new innovation on foundation 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.710
 area 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.379
 namely in December already and since then and 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.960
 that this foundation is regularly tested and 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.660
 I have therefore tried enough to 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.310
 a really good substantiated review 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.990
 to be able to do and only do 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.480
 nice to do in video form because it 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.880
 just such a separate and yet a bit 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.099
 strange kind of girl is well 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.130
 First of all, it is in the Merkel cabinet 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.559
 a very nice round box it is very 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.059
 very compact and it is different than what 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.710
 we are used to the foil job before 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.260
 this one is of course normal 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.670
 in a pot francs to this they are in 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.320
 a compact box and handy that the 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.199
 box or the lid itself 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.460
 Mirror is so that you just like you 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.270
 just want to do a quick check in one 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.770
 mirror 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.690
 I think getting the box user 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.910
 self hour easy if I already like him 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.320
 keep it out of my bag then you hit it 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.510
 open and then you see the 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.939
 inside again a mirror 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.220
 here we see an application bed 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.330
 with which you get the liquid foundation 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.810
 who can sit in this 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.390
 can apply here is a cover 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.369
 Well open that buddy and see 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.520
 so this and the first time i saw this 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.350
 I really had something of what is this 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.369
 how it is how we use things in 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.210
 apply 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.060
 but it is actually very easy 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.329
 you can very quickly it's really 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.060
 yours this is the cupboard therefore this is 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.140
 also a cupboard foundation Merkel cupboard 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.140
 and 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.420
 the liquid is in this soft cushion 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.990
 foundation cast to liquid 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.399
 foundation that hard out with the pet well 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.979
 that is just very easy and if 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.210
 follows occupies the bed in your hands 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.369
 you press this on the box and then 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.350
 sit the foundation on your bed then 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.850
 apply this to your face 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.010
 but the great thing about a wall concussion 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.080
 that coverage can be built very well 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.300
 The coverage is just as normal 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.340
 with normal forces 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.780
 medium to mention but if you are a little harder 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.380
 so you have a little more foundation 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.149
 your bed 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.709
 softer you a bit less and less 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.840
 that way you can just foundation 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.970
 apply what suits you 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.590
 what is also very nice is that the 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.030
 foundation so also easy on 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.709
 So build if you go to the first one 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.690
 hey low thinks I actually got up 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.400
 needed here and there you just go 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.870
 once over it and just press it 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.269
 what firm hoped skin 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.040
 following better coverage the cap is too 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.560
 very flexible you can just double 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.080
 folding and in this way very easy 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.590
 come to the tricky spots such as 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.850
 around the nose and under your eyes with 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.709
 you can actually just plague this 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.019
 coated the entire face 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.030
 foundation and that is of course very nice 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.700
 also for on the road normally 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.080
 I walk here with your fingertips or 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.850
 with a brush but now that is not 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.450
 needed because you throw everything together 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.040
 have 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.200
 other than the fact that it is just that whole 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.910
 it is easy to get a bag on the way 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.010
 do with this foundation I find one 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.510
 foundation itself also very nice 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.190
 we will apply one to the skin 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.660
 it just feels really nice and cool 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.100
 just a little cooling and loss 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.959
 on the skin 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.390
 he just covers pretty well and the 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.850
 coverage is also very good to build and 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.690
 provides a very nice even shade one 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:17.600
 I think it is a nice fresh gorge and then 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.209
 also nice is that the spf 23 is in as 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.920
 protects your skin from harmful 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.840
 UV rays from the sun 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.820
 and there is also adenosine in it and that 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.530
 is an anti-age agent a lot there 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.630
 very nice if you are like example 30 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.190
 I then that is always welcome that kind 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.989
 ingredients that are also very useful 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.400
 find that there are risks and what one 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.620
 new concussion 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.010
 just like you buy this man this one 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.150
 costs 42 euros and refill is 30 euros that 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.320
 saves time too 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.870
 price but of course it is also normal 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.910
 very good for the environment it is very good 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.800
 very easy among whom a lot 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.330
 get out there again and do in and 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.130
 all you have to do is if you just 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.350
 equally at the back is on one 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.690
 written part there you press with two 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.940
 thus rigidly against it then you hear 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.950
 a click and then make your drink europe 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.590
 and there simply refill by removing it from 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.450
 and tried a new one in doing so 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.040
 easy i noticed bring the same one from 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.870
 this one pretty thick and I now have three 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.510
 months done there because now again 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.160
 I have a clean river in the 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.170
 furniture cabinet and you then about three months 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.000
 tried it out and really with a lot 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.040
 pleasure i am a very very positive about it 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.040
 I just really like the finish 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.140
 I find it handy and compact 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.970
 I just really like packaging and me 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.500
 just love it and innovative 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.080
 ideas and it's great that you just do this 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.550
