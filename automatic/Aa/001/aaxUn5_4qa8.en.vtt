 and attention this program is not done 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.089
 responsible for the barbarities that 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.919
 they can get to make the spectators 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.389

 circumstance if you heard correctly 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.460
 circumstance the video you are going to see 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.560
 It has a high content of violence and 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.359
 offensive comments that's why they 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.770
 they force to put restrictions of age or 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.119
 but that's one thing that gives me a lot 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.119

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.980
