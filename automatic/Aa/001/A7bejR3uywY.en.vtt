00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
just tried all almost all the elite

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.840 
just tried all almost all the elite
weapons<00:00:37.380> all<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.620> actual<00:00:37.890> good<00:00:38.070> ones<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.730> I

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
weapons all the actual good ones and I

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.040 
weapons all the actual good ones and I
got<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.090> hair<00:00:39.329> trigger<00:00:39.570> at<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.690> Supply<00:00:39.989> Drop

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
got this hair trigger at a Supply Drop

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.900 
got this hair trigger at a Supply Drop
and<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:41.010> wasn't<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.280> league<00:00:41.489> weapon

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
and I it wasn't a league weapon

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.450 
and I it wasn't a league weapon
I<00:00:41.940> believe<00:00:42.450> it's<00:00:42.600> enlisted<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.590> it's<00:00:43.890> not<00:00:44.129> like

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
I believe it's enlisted so it's not like

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.549 
I believe it's enlisted so it's not like
you<00:00:44.670> know<00:00:44.789> super<00:00:45.210> huge<00:00:45.510> but<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:46.170> thing<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.410> I

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
you know super huge but the thing is I

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.650 
you know super huge but the thing is I
believe<00:00:46.860> it's<00:00:47.039> one<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.370> best<00:00:47.640> non<00:00:48.120> elite

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
believe it's one of the best non elite

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.510 
believe it's one of the best non elite
weapons<00:00:49.079> even<00:00:49.410> though<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.530> hole<00:00:49.680> puncher<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.250> I

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
weapons even though a hole puncher is I

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.369 
weapons even though a hole puncher is I
think<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.030> whole<00:00:51.149> bunch<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.480> beats<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.930> but

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
think the whole bunch of beats it but

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.689 
think the whole bunch of beats it but
this<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.620> definitely<00:00:52.800> up<00:00:53.129> there<00:00:53.160> with<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.610> like

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
this is definitely up there with it like

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:54.950 
this is definitely up there with it like
I<00:00:53.820> feel<00:00:53.969> like<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.180> hole<00:00:54.360> puncher<00:00:54.629> in<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:54.809> go

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
I feel like the hole puncher in this go

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.479 
I feel like the hole puncher in this go
neck-and-neck<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.620> just<00:00:55.770> all<00:00:55.949> depends<00:00:56.280> on<00:00:56.399> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
neck-and-neck it just all depends on the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.139 
neck-and-neck it just all depends on the
situation

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
situation

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.420 
situation
so<00:00:57.300> as<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.109> screen<00:00:58.379> I'll<00:00:58.680> not<00:00:58.980> see<00:00:59.219> on<00:00:59.399> the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
so as you a screen I'll not see on the

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
ak-12 hair-trigger now it has one less

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.329 
ak-12 hair-trigger now it has one less
accuracy<00:01:04.080> which<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.350> be<00:01:04.439> made<00:01:04.619> up<00:01:04.739> with<00:01:04.860> grip

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
accuracy which to be made up with grip

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.100 
accuracy which to be made up with grip
honestly<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.970> ak-12<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.570> such<00:01:06.720> an<00:01:06.810> accurate

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
honestly the ak-12 is such an accurate

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.780 
honestly the ak-12 is such an accurate
gun<00:01:07.380> in<00:01:07.560> itself<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.369> don't<00:01:08.520> only<00:01:08.640> need

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
grip in the minus one accuracy has no

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.890 
grip in the minus one accuracy has no
effect<00:01:11.640> on<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:11.939> now<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.390> thing<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.689> really

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
effect on it now the thing that really

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.109 
effect on it now the thing that really
makes<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.380> gun<00:01:13.560> viable<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.220> very<00:01:14.490> useful<00:01:14.939> in

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
makes is gun viable and very useful in

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.820 
makes is gun viable and very useful in
many<00:01:15.240> situations<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.140> one<00:01:16.320> plus<00:01:16.560> fire

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
many situations is the one plus fire

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.350 
many situations is the one plus fire
right<00:01:17.009> now<00:01:17.159> as<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.759> know<00:01:17.880> what<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.030> original

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
right now as you know what the original

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.870 
right now as you know what the original
ak-12<00:01:19.020> variant<00:01:19.619> it's<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.159> really<00:01:20.369> accurate<00:01:20.549> gun

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
ak-12 variant it's a really accurate gun

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.700 
ak-12 variant it's a really accurate gun
perfect<00:01:21.570> firing<00:01:21.960> but<00:01:22.110> when<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.259> had<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.439> aks

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
perfect firing but when you had the aks

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.760 
perfect firing but when you had the aks
with<00:01:22.890> one<00:01:23.460> plus<00:01:23.729> firing<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.530> don't<00:01:25.530> know<00:01:25.590> it

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
with one plus firing I don't know it

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.160 
with one plus firing I don't know it
makes<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.220> almost<00:01:26.580> uncontrollable<00:01:27.540> how<00:01:27.840> fast

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
makes it almost uncontrollable how fast

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.050 
makes it almost uncontrollable how fast
it<00:01:28.380> goes<00:01:28.500> for<00:01:28.710> an<00:01:28.770> assault<00:01:28.979> rifle<00:01:29.100> it's<00:01:29.820> like

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
it goes for an assault rifle it's like

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.319 
it goes for an assault rifle it's like
the<00:01:30.180> inferno<00:01:30.780> for<00:01:31.229> for<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.189> bow<00:01:32.490> 27<00:01:33.180> but

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
the inferno for for the bow 27 but

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.420 
the inferno for for the bow 27 but
honestly<00:01:33.659> this<00:01:34.140> gun<00:01:34.320> melts<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.710> ton<00:01:35.009> even

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
honestly this gun melts a ton even

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.710 
honestly this gun melts a ton even
though<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.520> con<00:01:35.790> it's<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.060> little<00:01:36.270> shaky<00:01:36.450> at

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
though a con it's a little shaky at

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.539 
though a con it's a little shaky at
long-range<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.259> still<00:01:37.470> feel<00:01:37.650> like<00:01:37.740> it's<00:01:38.189> one<00:01:38.460> of

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
long-range I still feel like it's one of

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.980 
long-range I still feel like it's one of
the<00:01:38.610> best<00:01:38.790> weapons<00:01:39.119> up<00:01:39.299> close<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.840> hole

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
the best weapons up close the hole

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.600 
the best weapons up close the hole
puncher<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.470> really<00:01:40.890> good<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.070> think<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.460> hole

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
puncher is really good I think the hole

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.340 
puncher is really good I think the hole
puncher<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.210> best<00:01:42.450> Nani<00:01:42.780> League<00:01:43.049> weapon

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
puncher is the best Nani League weapon

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.679 
puncher is the best Nani League weapon
from<00:01:43.920> medium<00:01:44.310> range<00:01:44.490> on<00:01:44.700> well<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.420> feel<00:01:45.630> like

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
from medium range on well I feel like

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.690 
from medium range on well I feel like
the<00:01:45.840> ak-12<00:01:46.110> hair-trigger<00:01:46.770> has<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.280> beat<00:01:47.490> up

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
the ak-12 hair-trigger has it beat up

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.670 
the ak-12 hair-trigger has it beat up
close<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.360> maybe<00:01:48.780> even<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.140> little<00:01:49.229> bit<00:01:49.350> longer

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
close and maybe even a little bit longer

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.109 
close and maybe even a little bit longer
and<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.009> depends<00:01:50.310> on<00:01:50.399> their<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.610> know<00:01:50.700> how<00:01:50.850> far

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
and it depends on their you know how far

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.520 
and it depends on their you know how far
you<00:01:51.299> are<00:01:51.329> from<00:01:51.450> enemy<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.020> stuff<00:01:52.170> like<00:01:52.290> that

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
you are from enemy and stuff like that

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.560 
you are from enemy and stuff like that

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
day first of all is the grip actually I

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.399
