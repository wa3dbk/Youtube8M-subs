different kind of holographic in the
fossil<00:02:34.830> version<00:02:35.690> like<00:02:36.690> it's<00:02:36.810> got<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:36.930> different

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
fossil version like it's got a different

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.560 
fossil version like it's got a different
style<00:02:37.410> of<00:02:38.420> shininess

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570
