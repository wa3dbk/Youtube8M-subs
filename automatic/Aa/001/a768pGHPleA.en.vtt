this one only has 97 thousand miles and
it's<00:02:59.090> a<00:02:59.150> 2004<00:03:00.459> had<00:03:01.459> problems<00:03:02.120> such<00:03:02.450> as<00:03:02.480> these

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
it's a 2004 had problems such as these

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.640 
it's a 2004 had problems such as these
should<00:03:03.140> have<00:03:03.230> happened<00:03:05.290> also<00:03:06.290> the

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
should have happened also the

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.640 
should have happened also the
transmission<00:03:07.010> was<00:03:07.480> you<00:03:08.480> know<00:03:08.629> shifting<00:03:09.560> over

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
transmission was you know shifting over

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:25.640 
transmission was you know shifting over
but<00:03:10.040> slow<00:03:10.430> so<00:03:10.790> that's<00:03:10.970> probably<00:03:11.420> a<00:03:11.569> bad<00:03:11.720> time

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.949 

you<00:03:25.980> can<00:03:26.129> see<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.459> engine<00:03:26.700> lights<00:03:26.879> flashing

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.039 

it's<00:03:32.950> a<00:03:33.069> smooth<00:03:33.400> driving<00:03:33.849> man<00:03:34.090> otherwise<00:03:34.569> it's

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
it's a smooth driving man otherwise it's

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:41.220 
it's a smooth driving man otherwise it's
just<00:03:38.340> each<00:03:39.340> year<00:03:39.609> ports<00:03:40.180> need<00:03:40.480> to<00:03:40.689> be<00:03:40.840> cleaned

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
just each year ports need to be cleaned

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.679 
just each year ports need to be cleaned
it's<00:03:41.950> a<00:03:42.069> common<00:03:42.459> problem<00:03:42.670> there's<00:03:43.180> a<00:03:43.299> design

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:43.689 
it's a common problem there's a design
