00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
first week but after that started to

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.620 
first week but after that started to
love<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.350> it's<00:01:52.680> brilliant<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.790> what<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.479> get

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
love it it's brilliant and what you get

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.709 
love it it's brilliant and what you get
with<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.049> lifetime<00:01:55.560> warranty<00:01:56.600> which<00:01:57.600> I

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
with it is a lifetime warranty which I

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.670 
with it is a lifetime warranty which I
expect<00:01:59.719> means<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:00.930> if<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.110> gets<00:02:01.290> scratched

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
expect means that if it gets scratched

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.819 
expect means that if it gets scratched
or<00:02:02.159> peels<00:02:02.880> off<00:02:03.149> or<00:02:03.479> loses<00:02:03.899> its<00:02:04.049> stickiness<00:02:04.259> or

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
or peels off or loses its stickiness or

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:11.300 
or peels off or loses its stickiness or
whatever<00:02:05.610> they'll<00:02:06.390> replace<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:07.079> for<00:02:07.469> free<00:02:10.310> but
