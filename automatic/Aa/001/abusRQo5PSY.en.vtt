things<00:02:33.550> into<00:02:33.790> our<00:02:33.880> product<00:02:34.300> I<00:02:34.600> think<00:02:34.930> it's

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
things into our product I think it's

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.930 
things into our product I think it's
just<00:02:35.230> better<00:02:35.470> for<00:02:35.740> the<00:02:35.860> beer<00:02:36.100> and<00:02:36.340> better<00:02:36.820> for

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
just better for the beer and better for

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.000 
just better for the beer and better for
the<00:02:37.000> consumer<00:02:37.410> so<00:02:38.410> basically<00:02:38.740> you're

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
the consumer so basically you're

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.390 
the consumer so basically you're
starting<00:02:39.370> off<00:02:39.520> with<00:02:40.170> with<00:02:41.170> malted<00:02:41.740> barley<00:02:42.040> in

starting off with with malted barley in

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.580 
starting off with with malted barley in
most<00:02:42.730> cases<00:02:42.940> sometimes<00:02:43.420> we<00:02:43.780> use<00:02:43.990> done<00:02:44.170> malted

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
most cases sometimes we use done malted

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.190 
most cases sometimes we use done malted
product<00:02:44.980> as<00:02:45.160> well<00:02:45.280> but<00:02:45.640> most<00:02:46.330> beer<00:02:46.570> is<00:02:46.750> malted

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
product as well but most beer is malted

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
within within the grain from that we're

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.770 
within within the grain from that we're
gonna<00:02:56.290> use<00:02:56.620> hot<00:02:56.890> water<00:02:57.070> once<00:02:58.000> hot<00:02:58.210> waters<00:02:58.570> and

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
gonna use hot water once hot waters and

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.020 
gonna use hot water once hot waters and
induce<00:02:59.170> to<00:02:59.380> the<00:02:59.470> grain<00:02:59.790> introduced<00:03:00.790> to<00:03:00.940> the

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
induce to the grain introduced to the

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.930 
induce to the grain introduced to the
grain<00:03:01.209> we<00:03:01.390> have<00:03:01.890> enzymes<00:03:02.890> on<00:03:03.160> the<00:03:03.310> green<00:03:03.520> that

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
grain we have enzymes on the green that

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.970 
grain we have enzymes on the green that
are<00:03:04.000> occur<00:03:04.720> naturally<00:03:04.959> which<00:03:05.620> are<00:03:05.800> going<00:03:05.920> to

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
are occur naturally which are going to

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.920 
are occur naturally which are going to
convert<00:03:06.490> those<00:03:06.670> carbohydrates<00:03:07.030> into

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
convert those carbohydrates into

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.530 
convert those carbohydrates into
fermentable<00:03:08.170> sugars<00:03:08.770> so<00:03:09.520> once<00:03:09.910> we<00:03:10.060> do<00:03:10.180> that<00:03:10.360> we

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
fermentable sugars so once we do that we

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.449 
fermentable sugars so once we do that we
have<00:03:10.690> this<00:03:10.840> big<00:03:11.050> porridge<00:03:11.620> almost<00:03:12.010> oatmeal

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
have this big porridge almost oatmeal

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.229 
have this big porridge almost oatmeal
looking<00:03:13.470> mixture<00:03:14.470> so<00:03:15.130> we<00:03:15.160> want<00:03:15.640> to<00:03:15.790> from<00:03:16.090> then

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
looking mixture so we want to from then

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.050 
looking mixture so we want to from then
strain<00:03:16.690> out<00:03:16.870> all<00:03:17.080> the<00:03:17.410> grain<00:03:17.650> and<00:03:17.980> just<00:03:18.880> take

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
strain out all the grain and just take

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.240 
strain out all the grain and just take
the<00:03:19.180> liquid<00:03:19.330> from<00:03:20.050> there<00:03:20.260> we'll<00:03:21.100> have<00:03:21.220> a

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
the liquid from there we'll have a

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.120 
the liquid from there we'll have a
boiling<00:03:22.120> kettle<00:03:22.380> so<00:03:23.380> we're<00:03:23.530> gonna<00:03:23.620> boil<00:03:23.920> all

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
boiling kettle so we're gonna boil all

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.110 
boiling kettle so we're gonna boil all
that<00:03:24.310> sugar<00:03:24.700> water

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
that sugar water

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.620 
that sugar water
it's<00:03:25.780> called<00:03:26.019> word<00:03:26.230> at<00:03:26.350> that<00:03:26.500> time<00:03:27.060> a<00:03:28.060> lot<00:03:28.360> of

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
it's called word at that time a lot of

will give you some bitterness whereas

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.530 
will give you some bitterness whereas
hops<00:03:35.140> later<00:03:35.560> on<00:03:35.800> then<00:03:36.489> give<00:03:37.000> you<00:03:37.090> more<00:03:37.269> flavor

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540

gonna<00:03:48.190> firm<00:03:48.489> it<00:03:48.640> those<00:03:48.790> sugars<00:03:49.150> that<00:03:49.360> we<00:03:49.450> made

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
gonna firm it those sugars that we made

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.180 
gonna firm it those sugars that we made
early<00:03:50.650> on<00:03:50.769> in<00:03:50.980> the<00:03:51.070> process<00:03:51.870> after<00:03:52.870> a<00:03:53.470> couple

beer you're trying to make we're going

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.710 
beer you're trying to make we're going
to<00:04:01.630> go<00:04:01.750> ahead<00:04:01.870> and<00:04:02.110> move<00:04:02.230> that<00:04:02.880> we<00:04:03.880> separate

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
to go ahead and move that we separate

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.690 
to go ahead and move that we separate
all<00:04:04.870> the<00:04:04.989> solids<00:04:05.410> out<00:04:05.560> so<00:04:06.070> any<00:04:06.370> sort<00:04:06.580> of

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
all the solids out so any sort of

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.810 
all the solids out so any sort of
proteins<00:04:07.420> hops<00:04:07.900> yeast<00:04:08.620> that<00:04:09.340> we<00:04:09.400> don't<00:04:09.670> want

in<00:04:09.880> the<00:04:09.970> beer<00:04:10.090> anymore<00:04:10.269> we're<00:04:10.780> gonna<00:04:10.870> separate

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
in the beer anymore we're gonna separate

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.949 
in the beer anymore we're gonna separate
those<00:04:11.530> out<00:04:11.709> move<00:04:11.980> it<00:04:12.100> to<00:04:12.190> a<00:04:12.220> bright<00:04:12.489> tank<00:04:12.959> and

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
those out move it to a bright tank and

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.470 
those out move it to a bright tank and
then<00:04:14.350> we'll<00:04:14.530> carbonate<00:04:15.340> it<00:04:15.459> and<00:04:15.639> from<00:04:16.299> there

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
then we'll carbonate it and from there

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.360 
then we'll carbonate it and from there
late<00:04:16.840> packaging<00:04:17.380> we're<00:04:17.560> will<00:04:17.799> be<00:04:17.920> canned<00:04:18.160> or
