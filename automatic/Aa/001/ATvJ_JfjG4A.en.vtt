we'll<00:03:28.329> try<00:03:28.510> this<00:03:28.569> I<00:03:28.930> to<00:03:29.109> make<00:03:29.440> some<00:03:29.590> space<00:03:29.859> that

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
we'll try this I to make some space that

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.920 
we'll try this I to make some space that
they<00:03:30.160> would<00:03:30.370> fit<00:03:30.549> in<00:03:33.299> so<00:03:34.299> there<00:03:34.450> was<00:03:34.540> four

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
they would fit in so there was four

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.530 
they would fit in so there was four
there

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.660 

and<00:03:38.540> you<00:03:39.050> go<00:03:39.200> we<00:03:39.530> were<00:03:39.680> just<00:03:39.710> run<00:03:39.950> back<00:03:40.100> so

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
and you go we were just run back so

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.930 
and you go we were just run back so
don't<00:03:40.700> get<00:03:40.910> the<00:03:41.030> cart<00:03:41.240> noises<00:03:42.370> and<00:03:43.370> if<00:03:43.790> this

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
don't get the cart noises and if this

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.900 
don't get the cart noises and if this
does<00:03:44.150> work<00:03:44.230> then<00:03:45.230> that<00:03:45.680> could<00:03:45.890> be<00:03:45.920> a<00:03:46.220> infinite

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
does work then that could be a infinite

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.420 
does work then that could be a infinite
iron<00:03:47.150> golem<00:03:47.570> army<00:03:47.990> to<00:03:48.560> kill<00:03:48.710> Endermen<00:03:49.190> around
