now in black ops 2 you get more XP and
score<00:00:34.559> for<00:00:34.980> working<00:00:35.370> with<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.579> objective<00:00:36.090> so

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
then you're going to be able to rank up

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.240 
then you're going to be able to rank up
very<00:00:39.780> fast<00:00:40.050> so<00:00:40.559> when<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.770> comes<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.100> game

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
very fast so when it comes to a game

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.130 
very fast so when it comes to a game
like<00:00:41.399> domination<00:00:42.000> ticking<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.750> home<00:00:42.899> flag

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
like domination ticking the home flag

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.440 
like domination ticking the home flag
then<00:00:43.379> B<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.770> going<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.250> get<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.489> more<00:00:44.700> XP<00:00:45.090> than

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
then B is going to get you more XP than

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.180 
then B is going to get you more XP than
just<00:00:45.719> cutting<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.079> home<00:00:46.260> flag<00:00:46.559> but<00:00:46.950> after

taking<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.670> be<00:00:47.820> flag<00:00:48.090> most<00:00:48.660> people<00:00:48.960> either

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
taking the be flag most people either

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.380 
taking the be flag most people either
move<00:00:49.379> back<00:00:49.710> or<00:00:50.039> press<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.670> spawn<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.090> try<00:00:51.270> and

this<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.580> really<00:01:05.909> an<00:01:06.119> effective<00:01:06.540> way<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.659> play

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
this is really an effective way to play

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.420 
this is really an effective way to play
because<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:07.350> domination<00:01:07.860> when<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.310> go

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
because in domination when you go

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.190 
because in domination when you go
against<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.820> really<00:01:09.060> strong<00:01:09.330> team<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.960> works

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
against a really strong team it works

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.539 
against a really strong team it works
really<00:01:10.560> well<00:01:10.680> because<00:01:11.130> you'll<00:01:11.250> be<00:01:11.340> able<00:01:11.400> to

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
really well because you'll be able to

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.100 
really well because you'll be able to
defend<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.939> flag<00:01:12.060> which<00:01:12.540> will<00:01:12.720> help<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.990> win

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
the game but you'll also be getting more

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.999 
the game but you'll also be getting more
points<00:01:15.630> per<00:01:15.750> kill<00:01:16.080> which<00:01:16.500> allows<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.890> get

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
points per kill which allows you to get

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.740 
points per kill which allows you to get
your<00:01:17.070> kill<00:01:17.369> streaks<00:01:17.580> faster<00:01:18.000> which<00:01:18.390> in<00:01:18.540> turn

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
your kill streaks faster which in turn

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
sure you get a ton of XP from this but

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.469 
sure you get a ton of XP from this but
I'll<00:01:26.189> get<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.490> in<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.729> bit<00:01:26.759> but<00:01:27.420> first

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
I'll get to that in a bit but first

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.090 
I'll get to that in a bit but first
we're<00:01:27.840> going<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:27.990> talk<00:01:28.110> about<00:01:28.200> Kill<00:01:28.530> Confirmed

we're going to talk about Kill Confirmed

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.069 
we're going to talk about Kill Confirmed
now<00:01:29.460> Kill<00:01:29.759> Confirmed<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:30.299> by<00:01:30.450> far<00:01:30.780> one<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:30.990> the

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
now Kill Confirmed is by far one of the

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.109 
now Kill Confirmed is by far one of the
fastest<00:01:31.470> ways<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.860> rank<00:01:32.040> up<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.400> most<00:01:32.820> people

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
fastest ways to rank up and most people

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.179 
fastest ways to rank up and most people
already<00:01:33.329> know<00:01:33.450> about<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:33.930> since<00:01:34.380> it's<00:01:34.500> 100<00:01:35.009> X

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189

already know about that since it's 100 X
paper<00:01:35.430> tag<00:01:35.850> but<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.479> can<00:01:36.600> take<00:01:36.750> huge

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
paper tag but you can take huge

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.480

also good at the start of a game when

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
fighting for the B flag since it saves

fighting for the B flag since it saves
you<00:02:25.150> needing<00:02:25.720> to<00:02:25.750> run<00:02:25.989> do<00:02:26.200> it<00:02:26.319> again<00:02:26.590> if<00:02:26.770> you

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
you needing to run do it again if you

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.160 
you needing to run do it again if you
die<00:02:27.220> but<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:27.880> tactical<00:02:28.239> insertion<00:02:28.330> itself<00:02:28.989> is

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
die but the tactical insertion itself is

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.380 
die but the tactical insertion itself is
amazing<00:02:29.560> for<00:02:29.890> running<00:02:30.099> up<00:02:30.190> fast<00:02:30.489> since<00:02:31.000> in<00:02:31.120> any

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
amazing for running up fast since in any

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.000 
amazing for running up fast since in any
objective<00:02:31.900> game-mode<00:02:32.319> being<00:02:32.650> able<00:02:32.739> to<00:02:32.860> choose

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
objective game-mode being able to choose

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.100 
objective game-mode being able to choose
where<00:02:33.220> you<00:02:33.310> spawn<00:02:33.550> is<00:02:33.760> a<00:02:33.790> huge<00:02:34.239> huge<00:02:34.900> advantage

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
where you spawn is a huge huge advantage

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.290 
where you spawn is a huge huge advantage
that<00:02:35.860> will<00:02:35.950> allow<00:02:36.160> you<00:02:36.250> to<00:02:36.310> rank<00:02:36.580> up<00:02:36.760> very<00:02:37.030> fast

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
that will allow you to rank up very fast

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.970 
that will allow you to rank up very fast
so<00:02:37.810> it<00:02:37.930> works<00:02:38.110> great<00:02:38.380> in<00:02:38.470> hardpoint

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
so it works great in hardpoint

you to rank up fast now to make this
easier<00:02:52.569> I've<00:02:52.930> created<00:02:53.200> two<00:02:53.530> classes<00:02:53.890> here

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
easier I've created two classes here

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:55.830 
easier I've created two classes here
that<00:02:54.100> work<00:02:54.489> really<00:02:54.850> well<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.299> they're<00:02:55.690> both

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
that work really well and they're both

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.390 
that work really well and they're both
very<00:02:55.900> similar<00:02:56.440> but<00:02:56.920> that's<00:02:57.069> just<00:02:57.280> because

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
very similar but that's just because

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.830 
very similar but that's just because
we're<00:02:57.700> using<00:02:57.880> them<00:02:58.090> for<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.299> same<00:02:58.480> reason

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
we're using them for the same reason

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.900 
we're using them for the same reason
which<00:02:59.170> is<00:02:59.230> to<00:02:59.380> get<00:02:59.590> as<00:02:59.680> much<00:02:59.890> XP<00:03:00.340> as<00:03:00.459> possible

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
which is to get as much XP as possible

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.820 
which is to get as much XP as possible
so<00:03:01.360> for<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.569> primary<00:03:02.049> we're<00:03:02.440> going<00:03:02.620> with<00:03:02.709> the

sir because at close range the
submachine<00:03:13.750> guns<00:03:13.959> really<00:03:14.319> benefit<00:03:14.709> from<00:03:14.739> not

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
submachine guns really benefit from not

submachine guns really benefit from not
having<00:03:15.250> a<00:03:15.310> damage<00:03:15.580> drop-off<00:03:15.940> which<00:03:16.390> is<00:03:16.569> what

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
having a damage drop-off which is what

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.210

you'll get when you use a silencer

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
so instead use the stock and quick-draw

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.039
