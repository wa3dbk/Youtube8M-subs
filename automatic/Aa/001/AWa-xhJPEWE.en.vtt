00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:11.750 
hello today I'm going to talk about butt

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.600 
hello today I'm going to talk about butt
you<00:00:11.810> can<00:00:11.990> see<00:00:12.170> I<00:00:12.440> have<00:00:12.770> been<00:00:13.010> working<00:00:13.460> on

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:13.610 
you can see I have been working on

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.480 
you can see I have been working on
making<00:00:13.880> this<00:00:14.770> buttonhole<00:00:15.770> and<00:00:15.799> trying<00:00:16.309> to

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490 
making this buttonhole and trying to

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.660 
making this buttonhole and trying to
make<00:00:17.150> it<00:00:17.300> look<00:00:17.450> neat<00:00:17.750> which<00:00:18.230> is<00:00:18.670> incredibly

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
make it look neat which is incredibly

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.990 
make it look neat which is incredibly
difficult<00:00:20.000> and<00:00:21.070> I<00:00:22.070> guess<00:00:22.220> that's<00:00:22.430> you<00:00:22.640> can<00:00:22.820> say

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
difficult and I guess that's you can say

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.790 
difficult and I guess that's you can say
that's<00:00:23.270> true<00:00:23.720> about<00:00:23.960> most<00:00:24.170> buttonholes

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
that's true about most buttonholes

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.359 
that's true about most buttonholes
they're<00:00:26.410> never<00:00:27.410> exactly<00:00:27.980> neat<00:00:28.490> and<00:00:28.789> tidy<00:00:30.369> but

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
they're never exactly neat and tidy but

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.930 
they're never exactly neat and tidy but
I'll<00:00:31.580> show<00:00:31.880> you<00:00:32.680> what<00:00:33.680> I<00:00:33.710> do<00:00:33.800> to<00:00:34.370> try<00:00:34.580> and<00:00:34.670> get

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
I'll show you what I do to try and get

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.630 
I'll show you what I do to try and get
this<00:00:35.120> to<00:00:35.180> be<00:00:35.750> as<00:00:35.930> neat<00:00:36.379> as<00:00:36.590> possible

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
this to be as neat as possible

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.460 
this to be as neat as possible
now<00:00:38.150> there<00:00:38.269> are<00:00:38.360> a<00:00:38.390> variety<00:00:38.540> of<00:00:38.840> ways<00:00:39.110> to<00:00:39.140> make

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
now there are a variety of ways to make

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.430 
now there are a variety of ways to make
buttonholes<00:00:40.100> and<00:00:40.940> this<00:00:41.269> would<00:00:41.480> be<00:00:41.690> a<00:00:41.960> to<00:00:42.260> roll

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
buttonholes and this would be a to roll

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.440 
buttonholes and this would be a to roll
button<00:00:42.650> role<00:00:42.920> or<00:00:43.280> sometimes<00:00:43.850> it's<00:00:44.000> described

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
button role or sometimes it's described

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.720 
button role or sometimes it's described
as<00:00:44.660> two<00:00:45.260> lips<00:00:45.500> because<00:00:45.920> it<00:00:46.070> looks<00:00:46.280> like<00:00:46.489> you

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
as two lips because it looks like you

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:54.729 
as two lips because it looks like you
know<00:00:46.820> two<00:00:47.149> lips<00:00:47.420> I'm<00:00:48.410> a<00:00:48.559> buttonhole<00:00:53.590> so<00:00:54.590> this

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
know two lips I'm a buttonhole so this

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:56.440 
know two lips I'm a buttonhole so this
is<00:00:54.920> how<00:00:55.100> it<00:00:55.309> goes

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
is how it goes

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.779 
is how it goes
knit<00:00:57.020> up<00:00:57.230> to<00:00:57.469> the<00:00:57.559> point<00:00:57.800> where<00:00:58.309> you<00:00:58.430> want<00:00:58.640> the

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
knit up to the point where you want the

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.299 
knit up to the point where you want the
buttonhole<00:00:59.210> so<00:00:59.570> I'm<00:00:59.660> going<00:00:59.870> to<00:00:59.899> knit<00:01:00.110> in<00:01:01.960> six

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
buttonhole so I'm going to knit in six

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:09.630 
buttonhole so I'm going to knit in six
stitches<00:01:04.750> one<00:01:05.750> two<00:01:05.990> three<00:01:06.530> four<00:01:06.890> five<00:01:07.690> six

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
stitches one two three four five six

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.840 
stitches one two three four five six
bring<00:01:10.640> the<00:01:10.759> young<00:01:10.970> forward<00:01:11.450> as<00:01:11.600> if<00:01:11.810> to<00:01:12.170> purl

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
bring the young forward as if to purl

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.929 
bring the young forward as if to purl
slip<00:01:13.850> the<00:01:14.210> next<00:01:14.330> stitch<00:01:14.479> over<00:01:15.080> purl<00:01:16.010> wise<00:01:16.250> take

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
slip the next stitch over purl wise take

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:19.690 
slip the next stitch over purl wise take
the<00:01:17.090> yarn<00:01:17.390> back<00:01:17.689> and<00:01:18.070> at<00:01:19.070> this<00:01:19.220> point<00:01:19.460> you<00:01:19.520> can

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
the yarn back and at this point you can

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.840 
the yarn back and at this point you can
drop<00:01:19.909> the<00:01:20.240> yarn<00:01:20.479> for<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:21.049> time<00:01:21.260> beam<00:01:21.700> slip<00:01:22.700> the

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
drop the yarn for the time beam slip the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.630 
drop the yarn for the time beam slip the
next<00:01:23.000> stitch<00:01:23.180> and<00:01:23.770> find<00:01:24.770> that<00:01:25.010> stitch<00:01:25.400> off

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
next stitch and find that stitch off

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.810 
next stitch and find that stitch off
this<00:01:26.390> is<00:01:26.570> one<00:01:26.930> bound<00:01:27.259> off<00:01:27.500> stitch<00:01:27.740> I<00:01:28.009> want<00:01:28.549> four

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
this is one bound off stitch I want four

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.289 
this is one bound off stitch I want four
stitches<00:01:29.060> bound<00:01:29.420> off<00:01:29.600> so<00:01:29.810> I'll<00:01:29.869> repeat<00:01:30.200> that

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
stitches bound off so I'll repeat that

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:41.190 
stitches bound off so I'll repeat that
two<00:01:34.869> three

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.840 

for<00:01:42.780> okay<00:01:43.780> now<00:01:44.439> this<00:01:44.619> resulting<00:01:45.369> stitch<00:01:45.670> is

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
for okay now this resulting stitch is

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.670 
for okay now this resulting stitch is
going<00:01:46.180> to<00:01:46.270> go<00:01:46.390> on<00:01:46.509> my<00:01:46.659> left<00:01:46.869> needle<00:01:47.080> and<00:01:47.590> I'll

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
going to go on my left needle and I'll

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.460 
going to go on my left needle and I'll
forget<00:01:47.979> about<00:01:48.040> it<00:01:48.460> for<00:01:48.729> now<00:01:49.020> now<00:01:50.020> over<00:01:50.229> here<00:01:50.380> is

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
forget about it for now now over here is

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.690 
forget about it for now now over here is
where<00:01:50.619> it<00:01:50.710> gets<00:01:50.740> a<00:01:50.950> little<00:01:51.070> tricky<00:01:51.369> and<00:01:51.580> this

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
where it gets a little tricky and this

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.609 
where it gets a little tricky and this
is<00:01:51.880> where<00:01:52.060> I<00:01:52.090> deviate<00:01:52.899> from<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.409> standard

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
is where I deviate from the standard

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.859 
is where I deviate from the standard
instruction<00:01:54.520> so<00:01:54.670> I'll<00:01:54.729> try<00:01:54.970> to<00:01:55.030> describe<00:01:55.390> as

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
instruction so I'll try to describe as

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.399 
instruction so I'll try to describe as
best<00:01:56.110> I<00:01:56.259> can<00:01:56.320> what<00:01:56.740> I'm<00:01:56.860> doing<00:01:58.049> here's<00:01:59.049> the

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
best I can what I'm doing here's the

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.740 
best I can what I'm doing here's the
Strand<00:01:59.799> from<00:01:59.979> where<00:02:00.220> I<00:02:00.250> wrapped<00:02:00.729> earlier<00:02:01.570> when

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
Strand from where I wrapped earlier when

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.749 
Strand from where I wrapped earlier when
I<00:02:01.780> brought<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.080> yarn<00:02:02.289> forward<00:02:02.530> so<00:02:03.250> if<00:02:03.369> I<00:02:03.490> pull

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
I brought the yarn forward so if I pull

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.929 
I brought the yarn forward so if I pull
on<00:02:03.789> it<00:02:04.119> it<00:02:04.659> comes<00:02:05.170> pretty<00:02:05.500> loose<00:02:05.770> so<00:02:06.700> what<00:02:06.850> I'm

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 
on it it comes pretty loose so what I'm

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:08.070 
on it it comes pretty loose so what I'm
gonna<00:02:07.060> do<00:02:07.330> is<00:02:07.420> I'm<00:02:07.479> going<00:02:07.570> to<00:02:07.630> go<00:02:07.750> underneath

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
gonna do is I'm going to go underneath

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.729 
gonna do is I'm going to go underneath
that<00:02:08.229> strand<00:02:08.560> and<00:02:09.009> underneath<00:02:10.410> this<00:02:11.410> other

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
that strand and underneath this other

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.930 
that strand and underneath this other
strand<00:02:12.250> here<00:02:13.590> that<00:02:14.590> is<00:02:14.769> actually<00:02:15.130> that<00:02:15.580> first

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
strand here that is actually that first

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.630 
strand here that is actually that first
stitch<00:02:16.750> I<00:02:16.959> had<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.620> first<00:02:17.890> stitch<00:02:18.130> I<00:02:18.280> slipped

that got bound off okay so I'm gonna go
underneath<00:02:22.600> that<00:02:22.720> strand<00:02:23.019> and<00:02:23.410> then<00:02:23.530> into

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
underneath that strand and then into

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.090 
underneath that strand and then into
that<00:02:25.120> stitch<00:02:25.750> there<00:02:26.049> and<00:02:26.319> I'm<00:02:26.440> gonna<00:02:26.620> pull<00:02:26.950> on
