00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.220
 the centennial platform is located at 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.050
 about 60 kilometers from the shores of 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.910
 Veracruz is one of the first in 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.970
 mexico who perform exploration in waters 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.920
 considered ultra deep and that is 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.900
 there are in the deep waters of the Gulf of 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.430
 Mexico is a large part of the 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.000
 crude reserves that Mexico has 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.000
 still 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.919
 from the air it is easy to see this 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.680
 gigantic one kilometer structure 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:32.420
 square that fulfills two functions 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.220
 On the one hand, it is a platform for 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.990
 exploration and on the other is a 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.520
 boat that can travel to 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:41.010
 any place 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.840
 after the reception in the heliport of 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.070
 the platform we are going to receive a talk 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.570
 about additional security and a 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.260
 explanation about what this 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.489
 monster of the sea 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.890
 also the first thing that attracts attention 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.910
 It is that almost no movement is perceived 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.309
 even though it is a platform 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.770
 floating that is not as clear as 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.780
 those of the shallow waters 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.760
 something fundamental to be able to do his 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.820
 drilling work to more than 2,000 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.820
 meters 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.000
 they explain to us that the platform 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.380
 centenary is of sixth generation and is 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.870
 doing explorations in waters 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.730
 ultra-deep and that in fact there is 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.800
 minus three wells that are located between 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.960
 ten deepest internationally 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.780
 this sixth generation means that 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.619
 no longer use anchors 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.280
 works with a positioning of p2 and 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:33.070
 p3 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.490
 redundant and that 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:39.180
 gives you greater advantages against the others 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.180
 previous systems 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.810
 then to be able to relocate absorb the 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.670
 movements 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.620
 of pizzi roll and vertical 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.740
 alone 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.570
 more complete how many platforms like 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.340
 this centenary there is more 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.070
 Now we have four platforms 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.950
 sixth generation centennial bicentennial 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.380
 then stuck simulate four 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.060
 if pemex that just entered the 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.000
 deep water terrain is 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.590
 quickly getting into the competition 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.150
 you had to meet the main 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.730
 responsible for reaching such 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.390
 depths the central part of all 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.390
 the platform 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.599
 it is a huge machine like a 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.610
 gigantic drill that is drilling 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.800
 slowly the seabed to more than 4 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.140
 kilometers of depth almost all the 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.780
 process is done by this solid robot 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.250
 we are in the core part of 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.620
 the platform that is the floor of 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.900
 drilling and itself is the goal 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.270
 main that is the well as you see 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.270
 you today we are handling pipeline 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.730
 57 eighths we are drilling the well 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:51.060
 mobile that in Spanish means 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.730
 prince at a depth of 4 thousand 800 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.370
 meters the objective is to incorporate 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.290
 gas reserves for so for 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.269
 our country 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.890
 but all the work that is done here 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.689
 is operated from the command center 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.030
 it really looks like a children's game 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:07.799
 but it is so far from the 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.450
 drillers have in their hands a 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.819
 millionaire investment and security 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.650
 the whole platform that is the heart of 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.200
 the whole platform like this is this is the 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.970
 command center of the entire platform 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:22.940
 as you can see everything is 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:25.480
 electronically they are no longer teams 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.630
 conventional and now we have 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.940
 the main chair that is the perforator 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.890
 the driller's assistant chair and 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.040
 one more for in case of any failure 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:40.850
 of the other two originally those that 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.700
 move all we are the this staff 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.560
 Foreign 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:49.750
 assisted by the second or assistant 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:53.450
 perforador and with everything monitored 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.370
 digitally one is practically 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.040
 working 24 hours a day and is 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.980
 in positions all are turns of 12 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.190
 hours enter and are relieved 12 by 12 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:07.160
 they are 28 by 28 we are 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.680
 14 by 14 at this time to what 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.260
 depth is drilling we are 48 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.850
 06 meters four thousand 806 meters 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.180
 perforated taking into account the brace 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:20.630
 the water depth is one thousand nine hundred 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.950
 thousand 956 meters of the bed of the bed 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.740
 Marine 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.690
 the sea surface and hence a 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.870
 3000 meters more back right for 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:32.300
 make them 4806 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.280
 but the goal is still far away 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:38.310
 kilometer below according to the calculations 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:40.110
 something that could take more than a month 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.970
 missing another important point for 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.830
 know and like something out of 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.380
 sci-fi movies the robot 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.870
 submarine 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.640
 this robot performs the daily work of 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.320
 check the seabed right on the 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.620
 place where the drilling is done 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.630
 training there at almost 2,000 meters of 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.490
 depth has to visualize the 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.440
 Tilt meters to verify 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.510
 that everything is in order and that there is not 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.730
 no type of leak the platform 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.590
 centenary is a small city in 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:09.170
 middle of the sea where they work around 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:12.680
 of 160 people between men and women 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:15.080
 those from pemex work 14 days and 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.610
 they rest 14 days also on land and 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.770
 those that give services of companies that 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.350
 they give services to Mexican petroleum 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:24.080
 they work 28 days in platform by 28 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.240
 days off 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.789
 a city where men and women coexist 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.590
 few very few women although every time 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:32.689
 there are more women interested in the 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.580
 oil industry is a dominated field 

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:37.129
 for men but women there are 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.259
 show that they are as or more capable than 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:41.840
 any man arlette espinoza is 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:43.310
 oil engineer for him and pn and now 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.409
 is a project engineer in the 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:48.620
 Centennial platform when there are many 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:50.270
 women in this teaching position in the 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:54.110
 entry profession but it is also 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:56.810
 platform here but not there many 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:59.289
 lately good we are already covering 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:02.449
 a little more women and that is 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:04.490
 quite well the complicated truth as 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:07.449
 we're all going to be outside your house 15 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.449
 days return 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:14.510
 the relationship between so much man is well 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:16.370
 good is also a matter of knowing 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:19.460
 take me for my part I have not had 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.200
 problems so far is not this this 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.020
 hand relationship from the school the 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.330
 we have always been less 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.740
 women than men but 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.659
 and it's pretty much the relationship that there 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.870
 here how many women today not here right now 

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:37.310
 we are like six women and there are about 150 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:40.060
 men so I insist it's not hard not 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:42.680
 it's not hard, it's not hard 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.960
 knowing how to handle the situation not sometimes 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.939
 it's a bit more complex as there are times 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:50.569
 that men pay more attention to you 

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:53.300
 you tell them what to do or what else to do 

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:57.469
 like it's a little more complicated but 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:59.389
 not really anymore it's not like before but 

00:06:57.469 --> 00:07:01.460
 there is still some that there is this little girl 

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:04.969
 united to me to say how to do things 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:06.829
 It is sometimes like everything 

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:08.269
 thus concluded the visit to one of the 

00:07:06.829 --> 00:07:10.429
 exploration platforms more 

00:07:08.269 --> 00:07:11.839
 important that the country that 

00:07:10.429 --> 00:07:13.189
 will continue for many months 

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:15.019
 working on the shores of the Gulf of 

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:16.819
 mexico with the goal of going 

00:07:15.019 --> 00:07:19.459
 consolidating gas and crude reserves 

00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:21.889
 of all Mexicans our black gold 

00:07:19.459 --> 00:07:24.330
 the main income today of 

00:07:21.889 --> 00:07:29.240
 our country
