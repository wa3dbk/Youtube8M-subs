00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:12.000
 in this program you will stay inside 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.830
 monkeys fattening one more delicacy 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.990
 full of nutrients and that is pumping 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.480
 in early fall I will show you too 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.430
 as it is very easy to prepare one guacamole 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.580
 bough and powerful break for the meetings 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.320
 with friends 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.090
 the avocado tree has adapted very well to 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.550
 Brazil he likes shady places 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.399
 of well-fenced land but never 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.219
 soggy detail that gives laziness 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.500
 the water is so large with up to 20 and 30 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.629
 that the fruits are almost 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.600
 inaccessible so I advise you 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.610
 invest in grafted seedlings in addition to 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.480
 more selected fruits they look good 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.000
 minors 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.610
 Avocado is an Aztec origin name so 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.070
 already delivers native fruit of the Americas and 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.800
 been cultivated since ancient times by 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.930
 pre-Columbian peoples to more than 500 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.989
 varieties of fruit from 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.989
 how to mexico to guatemala and the antilles 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:13.020
 Mexicans make guacamole using this 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.600
 variety here avocado which is smaller - 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.430
 sweet and in Brazil costs much more 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.570
 expensive but I'll tell you a little secret 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.299
 for you 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.909
 the guacamole looks so good or even better 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.340
 in my opinion with common avocado 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:32.430
 like butter and if we find 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:39.750
 anywhere but without exaggeration to 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:43.970
 not turning into a greasy one I'll put a 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:47.729
 seedless tomatoes remain in cubes 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:53.009
 locked common avocado or for every two 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:56.960
 if you have green tomatoes in 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.960
 house will combine more 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:08.399
 half a clove of garlic well smash salt to 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.250
 taste 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:15.060
 3 tablespoons of ordinary oil can be 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.830
 corn or canola sunflower ever 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.590
 olive oil because it is very strong and 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.980
 interfere in the taste of the soft mouth and now 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:27.750
 the three essential tips of the soft mouth 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:33.600
 a generous pinch of cumin broth 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:36.900
 lemon and a lavish amount of 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:43.740
 chopped coriander and the religious who 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:46.110
 sorry for the fashion and 50 dont let it 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.840
 rest a few minutes 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:53.070
 the flavor gets more accurate a rate 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.530
 Mexican cuisine to accompany and 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.600
 better turn the camera off because I do not 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.140
 I will resist and we will play in this 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.140
 wonderful
