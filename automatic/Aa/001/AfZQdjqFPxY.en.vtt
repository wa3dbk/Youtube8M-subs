videos but my impression of it is it's
brilliant<00:01:51.909> a<00:01:51.970> brilliant<00:01:52.000> step<00:01:52.600> up<00:01:52.750> from

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
brilliant a brilliant step up from

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.660 
brilliant a brilliant step up from
assassin's<00:01:53.380> creed<00:01:53.560> brotherhood<00:01:53.740> like

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
assassin's creed brotherhood like

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.810 
assassin's creed brotherhood like
difficulty<00:01:55.450> and<00:01:55.689> I<00:01:56.170> guess<00:01:56.710> the<00:01:56.829> cinematics<00:01:57.670> of

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
difficulty and I guess the cinematics of

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.260 
difficulty and I guess the cinematics of
it<00:01:57.939> as<00:01:58.030> well<00:01:58.210> it's<00:01:58.659> just<00:01:58.780> a<00:01:58.900> good<00:01:59.650> sequel<00:02:00.270> just

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
it as well it's just a good sequel just

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.149 
it as well it's just a good sequel just
a<00:02:01.360> very<00:02:01.570> good<00:02:01.720> so<00:02:02.020> that<00:02:02.170> cinematically<00:02:02.979> is

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
a very good so that cinematically is

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.249 
a very good so that cinematically is
beautiful<00:02:04.119> and<00:02:04.390> as<00:02:04.570> far<00:02:04.750> what<00:02:04.960> about<00:02:05.049> the

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
beautiful and as far what about the

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.080 
beautiful and as far what about the
mechanics<00:02:05.740> I<00:02:05.829> me<00:02:05.979> the<00:02:06.130> mechanics<00:02:06.250> changed<00:02:06.670> it

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
mechanics I me the mechanics changed it

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.550 
mechanics I me the mechanics changed it
all<00:02:07.240> is<00:02:07.420> smoother<00:02:07.899> because<00:02:07.990> I<00:02:08.140> remember<00:02:08.440> there

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
all is smoother because I remember there

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.830 
all is smoother because I remember there
were<00:02:08.649> some<00:02:08.829> glitches<00:02:09.149> an<00:02:10.149> assassin's<00:02:10.630> creed

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
were some glitches an assassin's creed

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.360 
were some glitches an assassin's creed
two<00:02:11.019> they<00:02:11.230> rubbed<00:02:11.590> a<00:02:11.680> lot<00:02:11.860> of<00:02:11.980> a<00:02:12.040> mountain

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
two they rubbed a lot of a mountain

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.699 
two they rubbed a lot of a mountain
Brotherhood<00:02:12.880> but<00:02:13.870> there<00:02:14.049> any<00:02:14.170> glitches<00:02:14.440> you

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
Brotherhood but there any glitches you

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.370 
Brotherhood but there any glitches you
found<00:02:14.950> as<00:02:15.160> a<00:02:15.190> choppy<00:02:15.549> at<00:02:15.820> all<00:02:16.200> pictures<00:02:17.200> well

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
found as a choppy at all pictures well

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.349 
found as a choppy at all pictures well
it's<00:02:17.650> running<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:18.040> same<00:02:18.220> engine<00:02:18.639> so<00:02:18.880> I<00:02:18.910> think

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:19.359 
it's running the same engine so I think

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:21.240 
it's running the same engine so I think
any<00:02:19.510> any<00:02:19.930> pictures<00:02:20.290> that<00:02:20.410> were<00:02:20.530> engine<00:02:21.070> base

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
any any pictures that were engine base

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.460 
any any pictures that were engine base
was<00:02:21.489> still<00:02:21.700> be<00:02:21.820> there<00:02:22.030> but<00:02:22.239> they've<00:02:23.079> ironed

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.229 
so was the story line did it live up to
expectations<00:03:42.400> because<00:03:42.730> this<00:03:42.879> was<00:03:43.090> the

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
expectations because this was the

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.900 
expectations because this was the
closing<00:03:43.569> of<00:03:43.959> this<00:03:44.889> particular<00:03:45.099> character<00:03:45.879> I

closing of this particular character I

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.080 
closing of this particular character I
believe<00:03:46.269> is<00:03:46.449> what<00:03:46.599> the<00:03:46.720> house<00:03:46.959> after<00:03:47.500> this

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.360 
believe is what the house after this
after<00:03:49.090> this<00:03:49.209> not<00:03:49.780> episode<00:03:50.169> but<00:03:50.650> you<00:03:51.160> know<00:03:51.250> what
