00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.209 
here we just had the workout for aamir
khan<00:00:08.120> how<00:00:09.080> sizeable<00:00:09.709> would<00:00:09.860> you<00:00:09.950> say<00:00:10.100> the

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:10.219 
khan how sizeable would you say the

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:12.040 
khan how sizeable would you say the
speed<00:00:10.520> differential<00:00:11.090> is<00:00:11.360> between<00:00:11.630> Khan<00:00:11.870> and

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:12.050 
speed differential is between Khan and

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.169 
speed differential is between Khan and
Peterson<00:00:12.500> I<00:00:12.769> think<00:00:13.250> Peter<00:00:13.400> says<00:00:13.639> very<00:00:13.880> quick

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:14.179 
Peterson I think Peter says very quick

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.140 
Peterson I think Peter says very quick
and<00:00:14.389> strong<00:00:14.870> at<00:00:15.080> the<00:00:15.170> same<00:00:15.349> time<00:00:15.559> so<00:00:15.860> as<00:00:16.490> far<00:00:17.090> as

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
and strong at the same time so as far as

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.580 
and strong at the same time so as far as
there<00:00:17.360> being<00:00:17.390> a<00:00:17.630> differential<00:00:18.200> I<00:00:18.259> think<00:00:18.470> it's

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
there being a differential I think it's

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.650 
there being a differential I think it's
maybe<00:00:18.710> just<00:00:19.100> the<00:00:19.520> fact<00:00:19.760> that<00:00:19.850> Amir's<00:00:20.270> a<00:00:20.330> little

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
maybe just the fact that Amir's a little

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.630 
maybe just the fact that Amir's a little
bit<00:00:20.779> more<00:00:20.960> busy<00:00:21.500> and<00:00:21.859> his<00:00:21.949> work<00:00:22.130> rate<00:00:22.279> to<00:00:22.460> hire

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
bit more busy and his work rate to hire

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.400

Soleil so light and there's not going to
really<00:01:08.120> be<00:01:08.210> a<00:01:08.330> lot<00:01:08.480> of<00:01:08.510> understanding<00:01:09.110> unless

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
really be a lot of understanding unless

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.320 
really be a lot of understanding unless
I<00:01:09.440> really<00:01:09.620> explain<00:01:10.070> it<00:01:10.100> so<00:01:10.400> I<00:01:10.610> just<00:01:10.790> leave<00:01:11.180> that

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
I really explain it so I just leave that

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.490 
I really explain it so I just leave that
just<00:01:11.600> the<00:01:11.750> you<00:01:11.960> know<00:01:11.990> the<00:01:12.200> way<00:01:12.290> we've<00:01:12.470> been

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
just the you know the way we've been

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.570 
just the you know the way we've been
doing<00:01:12.620> things<00:01:13.040> and<00:01:13.190> we've<00:01:13.310> been<00:01:13.430> successful

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
doing things and we've been successful

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.940 
doing things and we've been successful
doing<00:01:14.150> it<00:01:14.240> that<00:01:14.390> way<00:01:14.420> and<00:01:14.780> you<00:01:15.020> know<00:01:15.410> and<00:01:15.890> I

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
doing it that way and you know and I

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.410 
doing it that way and you know and I
think<00:01:16.160> the<00:01:16.220> best<00:01:16.400> way<00:01:16.490> to<00:01:16.610> look<00:01:16.880> at<00:01:17.000> is<00:01:17.150> look<00:01:17.300> at

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
think the best way to look at is look at

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.900 
think the best way to look at is look at
the<00:01:17.480> wheel<00:01:17.750> I<00:01:18.050> would<00:01:18.620> never<00:01:18.770> made<00:01:19.160> way<00:01:19.370> on<00:01:19.670> time

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
the wheel I would never made way on time

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.990 
the wheel I would never made way on time
he's<00:01:20.150> making<00:01:20.480> weight<00:01:20.600> every<00:01:20.870> time<00:01:21.080> making

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
he's making weight every time making

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.980 
he's making weight every time making
so<00:01:22.570> which

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
so which

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.590 
so which
talk<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.650> me<00:01:25.770> about<00:01:26.119> you've<00:01:27.119> been<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.299> critic

more<00:02:21.239> speed

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
more speed

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.089
