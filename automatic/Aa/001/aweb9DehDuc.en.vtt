for that after I just do a loop-de-loop
around<00:00:54.180> here<00:00:54.870> yeah<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.010> building<00:00:56.489> was

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
around here yeah so this building was

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.299 
around here yeah so this building was
designed<00:00:57.390> for<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.020> ranking<00:00:58.590> system<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:59.190> be

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
designed for a ranking system to be

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.639 
designed for a ranking system to be
implemented<00:00:59.940> in<00:01:00.480> my<00:01:00.750> world<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.410> when

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
implemented in my world so when

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.939 
implemented in my world so when
subscribers<00:01:02.579> join<00:01:03.439> sometimes<00:01:04.439> they<00:01:04.710> don't

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
subscribers join sometimes they don't

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.710 
subscribers join sometimes they don't
really<00:01:05.189> know<00:01:05.430> what<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.729> do<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.270> lot<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.510> people

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
really know what to do a lot of people

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.320 
really know what to do a lot of people
join<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.439> they<00:01:07.530> don't<00:01:07.740> really<00:01:07.920> want<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.400> build

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
join and they don't really want to build

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.270 
join and they don't really want to build

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
people have done in the world so let's

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.270 
people have done in the world so let's
look<00:01:36.299> at<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.810> ranks<00:01:37.200> real<00:01:37.500> quick<00:01:37.860> i'll<00:01:38.070> just

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
look at the ranks real quick i'll just

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.700 
look at the ranks real quick i'll just
give<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.700> quick<00:01:39.180> glimpse<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.229> idea<00:01:40.590> of

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
give you a quick glimpse and the idea of

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.249 
give you a quick glimpse and the idea of
it<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:41.270> when<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.360> go<00:01:42.479> in<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.689> world<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:43.140> don't

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259
