00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.279 

variations<00:00:42.809> usually<00:00:43.710> kill<00:00:43.890> them<00:00:44.040> therefore<00:00:44.879> I

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
variations usually kill them therefore I

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.590 
variations usually kill them therefore I
have<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.770> heating<00:00:47.760> system<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.270> water<00:00:48.450> or

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
have a heating system in the water or

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.709 
have a heating system in the water or
waters<00:00:48.809> fairly<00:00:49.050> one<00:00:49.579> this<00:00:50.579> pump<00:00:50.910> sucks<00:00:51.660> the

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
waters fairly one this pump sucks the

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.450 
waters fairly one this pump sucks the
water<00:00:51.809> up<00:00:52.020> blows<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.680> into<00:00:52.860> here<00:00:53.070> oops

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
water up blows it into here oops

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.490 
water up blows it into here oops
and<00:00:53.640> that's<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.629> UV<00:00:54.989> be<00:00:56.000> filter<00:00:57.000> UVB<00:00:57.899> kills<00:00:58.320> any

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
and that's a UV be filter UVB kills any

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.020 
and that's a UV be filter UVB kills any
bacteria<00:00:58.559> whatnot<00:00:59.219> which<00:00:59.370> really<00:00:59.640> isn't<00:00:59.850> so

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
bacteria whatnot which really isn't so

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.220 
bacteria whatnot which really isn't so
much<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.270> problem<00:01:00.329> in<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:00.690> case<00:01:00.870> but<00:01:01.140> it's

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
much of a problem in this case but it's

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.650 
much of a problem in this case but it's
designed<00:01:01.530> for<00:01:01.559> fish<00:01:01.940> but<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.329> main<00:01:03.449> thing<00:01:03.629> is

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
designed for fish but the main thing is

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.179 
designed for fish but the main thing is
cuz<00:01:03.930> these<00:01:04.049> guys<00:01:04.110> defecate<00:01:04.799> in<00:01:04.920> their<00:01:05.010> water

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
cuz these guys defecate in their water

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.490 
cuz these guys defecate in their water
and<00:01:05.549> clean<00:01:05.760> all<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.939> poo<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.090> pier<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.689> see

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
and clean all the poo and pier you see

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.350 
and clean all the poo and pier you see
if<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.650> massive<00:01:07.979> turnover<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:08.970> water<00:01:09.119> sets

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
if the massive turnover of water sets

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.060 
if the massive turnover of water sets
the<00:01:09.570> stage<00:01:09.869> pretty<00:01:10.110> spotless<00:01:10.530> all<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.770> time

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.390 

I've<00:01:14.070> got<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:15.350> new<00:01:16.350> energy<00:01:16.710> saving<00:01:17.220> globe<00:01:17.369> just

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
I've got a new energy saving globe just

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.090 
I've got a new energy saving globe just
here<00:01:17.759> in<00:01:17.970> order<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.270> produce<00:01:18.780> what<00:01:19.229> no<00:01:19.710> more<00:01:19.920> no

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
here in order to produce what no more no

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.859 
here in order to produce what no more no
less<00:01:20.180> but<00:01:21.180> up<00:01:21.330> here

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
less but up here

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.050 
less but up here
this<00:01:22.200> puts<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.650> massive<00:01:23.040> heat<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.880> just

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
this puts that massive heat that just

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.350 
this puts that massive heat that just
does<00:01:24.210> light<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.720> that's<00:01:24.840> 160<00:01:25.350> watt<00:01:25.680> here<00:01:25.860> VB

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
does light and that's 160 watt here VB

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.359 
does light and that's 160 watt here VB
so<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:28.320> can't<00:01:28.590> come<00:01:28.799> down<00:01:28.920> here<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.280> get

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
so it can't come down here and get

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.740 
so it can't come down here and get
fairly<00:01:29.610> cool<00:01:29.909> there's<00:01:30.150> different<00:01:30.390> stages

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
fairly cool there's different stages

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.289 
fairly cool there's different stages
