residency to begin with when meeting
Kelly<00:00:49.729> we<00:00:50.420> had<00:00:50.749> some<00:00:51.350> real<00:00:51.559> similarities<00:00:52.249> in

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:52.429 
Kelly we had some real similarities in

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:53.889 
Kelly we had some real similarities in
our<00:00:52.579> working<00:00:52.819> that<00:00:53.149> we're<00:00:53.269> both<00:00:53.389> physical

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
our working that we're both physical

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.169 
our working that we're both physical
based<00:00:54.170> but<00:00:54.829> hers<00:00:54.979> is<00:00:55.010> much<00:00:55.399> more<00:00:55.609> physical<00:00:55.789> and

00:00:56.169 --> 00:00:56.179 
based but hers is much more physical and

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:58.000 
based but hers is much more physical and
abstract<00:00:56.600> and<00:00:56.719> a<00:00:56.839> line<00:00:56.960> leads<00:00:57.260> into<00:00:57.530> the<00:00:57.620> text

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
abstract and a line leads into the text

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.849 
abstract and a line leads into the text
so<00:00:58.129> that<00:00:58.159> seems<00:00:58.609> like<00:00:58.819> we<00:00:58.999> had<00:00:59.299> a<00:00:59.589> nice<00:01:00.589> place

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
so that seems like we had a nice place

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:02.049 
so that seems like we had a nice place
to<00:01:00.889> meet<00:01:01.039> together

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
to meet together

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
I thrive and I create best in that

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.700 
I thrive and I create best in that
friction<00:01:07.430> of<00:01:07.580> rubbing<00:01:07.970> up<00:01:08.150> against<00:01:08.710> somebody

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
friction of rubbing up against somebody

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.770 
friction of rubbing up against somebody
else<00:01:09.890> or<00:01:10.100> somebody<00:01:10.250> else's<00:01:10.610> ideas

else or somebody else's ideas
and<00:01:11.870> that<00:01:12.410> that<00:01:12.680> is<00:01:12.830> a<00:01:12.860> really<00:01:13.280> exciting<00:01:13.580> place

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
and that that is a really exciting place

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.070 
and that that is a really exciting place

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
I'm not a formal director but in this

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.080 
I'm not a formal director but in this
environment<00:01:18.410> I've<00:01:18.950> been<00:01:19.280> a<00:01:19.310> performer<00:01:19.670> and

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.120 
environment I've been a performer and
that<00:01:20.390> has<00:01:20.600> challenged<00:01:21.110> me<00:01:21.200> but<00:01:21.620> it's<00:01:21.770> made<00:01:21.979> me

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
that has challenged me but it's made me

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.790 
that has challenged me but it's made me
and<00:01:22.220> relook<00:01:22.640> at<00:01:22.790> my<00:01:22.970> practice<00:01:23.240> again<00:01:23.960> from<00:01:24.740> a

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
some time to look around and to get a

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.780 
some time to look around and to get a

idea of of being given gifts and
originally<00:01:58.670> that<00:01:58.820> was<00:01:58.880> gonna<00:01:59.180> be<00:01:59.300> physical

get<00:03:53.220> really<00:03:53.400> nervous<00:03:53.720> so<00:03:54.720> it<00:03:54.750> was<00:03:54.930> quite<00:03:55.320> scary

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
get really nervous so it was quite scary

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.710 
get really nervous so it was quite scary
but<00:03:56.010> once<00:03:56.160> we'd<00:03:56.670> worked<00:03:56.910> with<00:03:57.180> Kelly<00:03:57.630> and

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
but once we'd worked with Kelly and

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.250 
but once we'd worked with Kelly and
Julie<00:03:58.020> for<00:03:58.200> a<00:03:58.260> while<00:03:58.470> it<00:03:59.160> was<00:03:59.310> good<00:04:00.000> to<00:04:00.420> just<00:04:00.750> do

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
Julie for a while it was good to just do

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.800 
Julie for a while it was good to just do
what<00:04:01.440> even<00:04:01.709> have<00:04:02.010> no<00:04:02.310> shame

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.070 

the<00:04:06.560> fact<00:04:06.830> that<00:04:06.950> they're<00:04:07.190> working<00:04:08.080> publicly

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
the fact that they're working publicly

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.840 
the fact that they're working publicly
caused<00:04:09.620> a<00:04:09.740> bit<00:04:09.860> of<00:04:09.890> a<00:04:10.010> challenge<00:04:10.340> from<00:04:10.459> time<00:04:10.700> to

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
caused a bit of a challenge from time to

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.510 
caused a bit of a challenge from time to
time<00:04:10.880> I<00:04:11.270> think<00:04:11.959> the<00:04:12.200> first<00:04:12.440> time<00:04:12.650> they<00:04:13.310> went

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:13.520 
time I think the first time they went

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.460 
time I think the first time they went
out<00:04:13.850> there<00:04:14.480> was<00:04:14.600> some<00:04:14.750> concern<00:04:15.230> that<00:04:15.410> they

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
out there was some concern that they

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.190 
out there was some concern that they
would<00:04:15.590> break<00:04:15.709> mobs<00:04:16.070> of<00:04:16.400> students<00:04:16.970> because<00:04:17.720> if

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
would break mobs of students because if

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.440 
would break mobs of students because if
a<00:04:18.470> big<00:04:18.769> congregation<00:04:19.609> like<00:04:19.760> that<00:04:19.970> happens<00:04:20.329> it

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
a big congregation like that happens it

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.530 
a big congregation like that happens it
usually<00:04:20.780> means<00:04:20.959> something<00:04:21.709> bad<00:04:22.010> is<00:04:22.280> happening

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
usually means something bad is happening

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.300 
usually means something bad is happening
but<00:04:23.540> it<00:04:23.690> meant<00:04:23.870> that<00:04:23.930> we've<00:04:24.139> come<00:04:24.380> before<00:04:24.560> is

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
but it meant that we've come before is

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.640 
but it meant that we've come before is
it<00:04:25.430> okay<00:04:25.700> if<00:04:25.850> students<00:04:26.210> gather<00:04:26.480> perform<00:04:27.470> these

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
it okay if students gather perform these

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.230 
it okay if students gather perform these
type<00:04:27.919> groups<00:04:28.220> how<00:04:28.430> do<00:04:28.490> we<00:04:28.610> feel<00:04:28.790> about<00:04:28.820> that

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
type groups how do we feel about that

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.420 
type groups how do we feel about that
just<00:04:29.720> a<00:04:29.810> question<00:04:30.230> I<00:04:30.410> think<00:04:30.470> is<00:04:30.770> really<00:04:31.010> a

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
just a question I think is really a

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.940 
just a question I think is really a
useful<00:04:31.910> thing<00:04:32.180> oh<00:04:34.900> I<00:04:35.900> was<00:04:36.050> crazy<00:04:36.380> everyone<00:04:36.800> was

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
useful thing oh I was crazy everyone was

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.790 
useful thing oh I was crazy everyone was
falling<00:04:37.370> around<00:04:37.520> and<00:04:38.169> it<00:04:39.169> was<00:04:39.260> just<00:04:39.410> amazing

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
falling around and it was just amazing

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.350 
falling around and it was just amazing
to<00:04:40.190> see<00:04:40.220> what<00:04:40.340> like<00:04:40.580> everyone<00:04:40.940> else<00:04:41.090> thought

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
to see what like everyone else thought

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.000 
to see what like everyone else thought
of<00:04:41.480> what<00:04:41.840> they<00:04:41.990> were<00:04:42.110> doing<00:04:42.380> because<00:04:42.710> we<00:04:42.890> had

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
of what they were doing because we had

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.440 
of what they were doing because we had
we<00:04:43.220> all<00:04:43.340> have<00:04:43.460> our<00:04:43.580> own<00:04:43.700> opinions<00:04:44.180> and<00:04:44.240> stuff

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
we all have our own opinions and stuff

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.990 
we all have our own opinions and stuff
with<00:04:44.660> it<00:04:44.750> a<00:04:44.840> crazy<00:04:45.169> lady<00:04:45.500> or<00:04:45.770> doing<00:04:46.520> some<00:04:46.730> cool

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
with it a crazy lady or doing some cool

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.830 
with it a crazy lady or doing some cool
kind<00:04:47.240> of<00:04:47.270> art<00:04:47.830> movement<00:04:48.830> kind<00:04:49.010> of<00:04:49.130> piece<00:04:49.840> we

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
kind of art movement kind of piece we

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.420 
kind of art movement kind of piece we
just<00:04:51.140> did<00:04:51.440> that<00:04:51.560> thing<00:04:51.830> where<00:04:51.950> she<00:04:52.130> moves

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
just did that thing where she moves

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:58.450 
just did that thing where she moves
really<00:04:53.150> slowly<00:04:56.800> the<00:04:57.800> beautiful<00:04:58.250> thing<00:04:58.430> about

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
really slowly the beautiful thing about

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.700 
really slowly the beautiful thing about
performance<00:04:59.240> is<00:04:59.479> that<00:04:59.720> there's<00:05:00.229> nothing<00:05:00.380> left

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
performance is that there's nothing left

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.800 
performance is that there's nothing left
you<00:05:01.370> do<00:05:01.550> it<00:05:01.700> and<00:05:01.910> it's<00:05:02.060> gone<00:05:02.270> if<00:05:02.479> it's<00:05:02.630> live

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
you do it and it's gone if it's live

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.450 
you do it and it's gone if it's live
performance<00:05:03.290> so<00:05:03.740> we<00:05:03.860> thought<00:05:03.979> let's<00:05:04.040> figure

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
performance so we thought let's figure

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.340 
performance so we thought let's figure
out<00:05:04.700> ways<00:05:04.970> to<00:05:05.000> articulate<00:05:05.600> that<00:05:05.840> and<00:05:05.990> try<00:05:06.229> and

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
out ways to articulate that and try and

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.290 
out ways to articulate that and try and
capture<00:05:06.560> it<00:05:06.830> in<00:05:07.040> the<00:05:07.370> moment<00:05:07.700> in<00:05:07.790> some<00:05:08.000> sense

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
capture it in the moment in some sense

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.719 
capture it in the moment in some sense
so<00:05:08.960> we<00:05:09.050> can<00:05:09.200> return<00:05:09.350> to<00:05:09.560> it<00:05:09.890> and<00:05:10.160> we<00:05:10.340> started<00:05:10.640> a

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
so we can return to it and we started a

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:13.930 
so we can return to it and we started a
blog<00:05:11.229> so<00:05:12.229> we've<00:05:12.380> got<00:05:12.590> this<00:05:12.770> history<00:05:13.490> basically

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
blog so we've got this history basically

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.540 
blog so we've got this history basically
once<00:05:14.150> a<00:05:14.300> week<00:05:14.479> sometimes<00:05:14.990> more<00:05:15.080> we<00:05:15.890> both<00:05:16.160> post

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
once a week sometimes more we both post

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.210 
once a week sometimes more we both post
to<00:05:16.729> that<00:05:16.760> blog<00:05:17.090> it's<00:05:18.080> been<00:05:18.290> a<00:05:18.500> beautiful<00:05:18.770> way

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
to that blog it's been a beautiful way

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.270 
to that blog it's been a beautiful way
of<00:05:19.580> figuring<00:05:20.300> out<00:05:20.479> how<00:05:20.900> do<00:05:20.960> we<00:05:21.110> translate<00:05:21.590> what

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
of figuring out how do we translate what

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.620 
of figuring out how do we translate what
we're<00:05:22.460> doing<00:05:22.700> to<00:05:22.850> different<00:05:23.180> communities<00:05:23.600> and

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
we're doing to different communities and

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.230 
we're doing to different communities and
different<00:05:23.900> audiences<00:05:24.590> and<00:05:24.890> perhaps<00:05:25.460> the<00:05:25.970> blog

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
different audiences and perhaps the blog

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.630 
different audiences and perhaps the blog
is<00:05:26.630> another<00:05:27.200> attempt<00:05:27.680> at<00:05:27.740> that<00:05:27.919> translation

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:28.640 
is another attempt at that translation

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.880 
is another attempt at that translation
translation<00:05:29.479> what<00:05:29.900> we<00:05:30.050> have<00:05:30.200> done<00:05:30.320> physically

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:30.890 
translation what we have done physically

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:32.890 
translation what we have done physically
or<00:05:31.100> what<00:05:31.430> we've<00:05:31.640> thought<00:05:31.910> about<00:05:32.210> or<00:05:32.630> what

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
or what we've thought about or what

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.980 
or what we've thought about or what
we've<00:05:33.050> talked<00:05:33.350> about<00:05:33.850> into<00:05:34.850> this<00:05:35.360> virtual

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
we've talked about into this virtual

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.770 
we've talked about into this virtual
world<00:05:36.169> that<00:05:36.289> others<00:05:36.620> can<00:05:36.830> share<00:05:37.100> in<00:05:37.780> this

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
world that others can share in this

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.280 
world that others can share in this
residency<00:05:39.440> has<00:05:39.620> been<00:05:39.800> about<00:05:40.100> experiment

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:42.290 
residency has been about experiment

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.910 
residency has been about experiment
and<00:05:43.000> exploration<00:05:44.260> but<00:05:45.260> it's<00:05:45.440> brought<00:05:45.650> us<00:05:45.740> to<00:05:45.890> a

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:45.920 
and exploration but it's brought us to a

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.040 
and exploration but it's brought us to a
point<00:05:46.130> where<00:05:46.400> we<00:05:46.550> go<00:05:46.730> yes<00:05:47.360> we<00:05:47.660> want<00:05:47.990> to

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
point where we go yes we want to

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.470 
point where we go yes we want to
continue<00:05:48.320> this<00:05:48.650> the<00:05:49.610> most<00:05:49.910> interesting<00:05:50.360> is<00:05:50.450> a

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:50.480 
continue this the most interesting is a

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.560 
continue this the most interesting is a
new<00:05:50.660> compound<00:05:51.080> that<00:05:51.800> we<00:05:51.890> don't<00:05:52.160> compromise<00:05:53.150> in

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570 
new compound that we don't compromise in

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.210 
new compound that we don't compromise in
any<00:05:53.660> way<00:05:53.900> who<00:05:54.410> we<00:05:54.530> are<00:05:54.740> or<00:05:54.890> what<00:05:55.040> we're<00:05:55.190> doing

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.220 
any way who we are or what we're doing

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.700 
any way who we are or what we're doing
we're<00:05:55.550> not<00:05:55.670> looking<00:05:55.970> for<00:05:56.150> a<00:05:56.180> mix<00:05:56.450> but<00:05:57.320> what<00:05:57.560> is

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
we're not looking for a mix but what is

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.830 
we're not looking for a mix but what is
really<00:05:57.860> Julie<00:05:58.400> and<00:05:58.580> Kelly<00:05:59.090> what<00:05:59.390> if<00:05:59.510> you<00:05:59.600> put

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 
really Julie and Kelly what if you put

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.660 
really Julie and Kelly what if you put
those<00:05:59.960> two<00:06:00.230> things<00:06:00.260> together<00:06:00.620> what<00:06:01.340> new

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:01.670 
those two things together what new

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.520 
those two things together what new
compound<00:06:02.090> have<00:06:02.210> we<00:06:02.330> created<00:06:02.510> and<00:06:02.960> so<00:06:03.380> with

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530 
compound have we created and so with

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.370 
compound have we created and so with
more<00:06:03.680> time<00:06:04.010> I'll<00:06:04.460> be<00:06:04.700> related<00:06:05.120> to<00:06:05.150> see<00:06:05.510> what

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 
more time I'll be related to see what

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.870 
more time I'll be related to see what
that<00:06:06.530> compound<00:06:07.040> can<00:06:07.190> grow<00:06:07.370> and<00:06:07.520> what<00:06:07.640> it<00:06:07.730> can

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 
that compound can grow and what it can

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.550 
that compound can grow and what it can
contribute<00:06:08.150> both<00:06:08.570> to<00:06:08.630> us<00:06:08.990> as<00:06:09.140> individual

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 
contribute both to us as individual

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.330 
contribute both to us as individual
artists<00:06:10.070> but<00:06:10.550> also<00:06:10.790> to<00:06:11.320> the<00:06:12.320> art<00:06:12.470> that<00:06:12.650> we<00:06:12.710> are

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.340 
artists but also to the art that we are

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.150 
artists but also to the art that we are
determined<00:06:13.880> to<00:06:13.910> make
