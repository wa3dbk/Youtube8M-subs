00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
reading it this is a healthier option I

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.359 
reading it this is a healthier option I
think<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.270> anytime<00:01:40.049> we're<00:01:40.560> steaming<00:01:40.890> things

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.490 
think that anytime we're steaming things
particularly<00:01:42.060> that's<00:01:42.630> probably<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.200> one<00:01:43.350> of

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
particularly that's probably that one of

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.840 
particularly that's probably that one of
the<00:01:43.560> healthiest<00:01:44.130> type<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.490> cooking

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
the healthiest type of cooking

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.780 
the healthiest type of cooking
techniques<00:01:45.590> sauteing<00:01:46.590> can<00:01:46.920> be<00:01:47.040> good<00:01:47.250> frying

can be okay it depends on the item but

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.590 
can be okay it depends on the item but
that<00:04:38.220> probably<00:04:38.550> means<00:04:38.850> that<00:04:39.030> it<00:04:39.180> was<00:04:39.270> fri

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
that probably means that it was fri

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.430

cream<00:04:40.310> definitely<00:04:41.310> is<00:04:41.610> is<00:04:42.360> a<00:04:42.539> is<00:04:42.930> a<00:04:43.110> heavy

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
cream definitely is is a is a heavy

cream definitely is is a is a heavy
thing<00:04:44.120> especially<00:04:45.120> when<00:04:45.479> it's<00:04:45.780> incorporating

to mashed potatoes and butter you know
that<00:04:49.680> I<00:04:49.890> think<00:04:50.430> that<00:04:50.490> when<00:04:50.729> you<00:04:50.820> have<00:04:50.970> some

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
that I think that when you have some

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.090 
that I think that when you have some
fats<00:04:51.630> like<00:04:51.870> with<00:04:52.140> the<00:04:52.260> salad<00:04:52.770> where<00:04:52.979> is<00:04:53.070> a

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
fats like with the salad where is a

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.529 
fats like with the salad where is a
little<00:04:53.460> bit<00:04:53.580> of<00:04:53.669> fat<00:04:53.880> and<00:04:54.090> the<00:04:54.180> goat<00:04:54.330> cheese

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:54.539 
little bit of fat and the goat cheese

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:56.180 
little bit of fat and the goat cheese
but<00:04:54.810> mostly<00:04:55.169> though<00:04:55.350> the<00:04:55.500> rest<00:04:55.710> of<00:04:55.860> the<00:04:55.950> plate

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
but mostly though the rest of the plate

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.400 
but mostly though the rest of the plate
doesn't<00:04:56.490> have<00:04:56.789> it<00:04:57.000> you<00:04:57.870> have<00:04:57.900> a<00:04:58.020> good<00:04:58.229> balance
