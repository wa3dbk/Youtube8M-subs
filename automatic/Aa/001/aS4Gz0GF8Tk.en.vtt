you<00:00:31.260> see<00:00:31.439> over<00:00:31.710> here<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:31.980> 10<00:00:32.279> inch<00:00:32.489> system

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
you see over here is a 10 inch system

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.470 
you see over here is a 10 inch system
right<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.649> it<00:00:34.649> runs<00:00:34.890> on<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.309> points<00:00:36.000> based<00:00:36.239> on

right and it runs on the points based on

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.780 
right and it runs on the points based on
the<00:00:36.600> quad<00:00:36.840> come<00:00:37.050> snapback<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.920> fall<00:00:38.190> means

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
the quad come snapback that fall means

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.750 
the quad come snapback that fall means
it's<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.030> 1<00:00:39.210> gigahertz<00:00:39.540> CPU<00:00:40.100> it's<00:00:41.100> integrated

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
it's a 1 gigahertz CPU it's integrated

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.569 
it's a 1 gigahertz CPU it's integrated
Wi-Fi<00:00:41.940> integrated<00:00:42.870> suite<00:00:42.960> g<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.680> are

Wi-Fi integrated suite g and are

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.720 
Wi-Fi integrated suite g and are
actually<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.660> system<00:00:46.140> sponsor<00:00:46.800> battery<00:00:47.460> life

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
actually the system sponsor battery life

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.600 
actually the system sponsor battery life
from<00:00:48.000> 10<00:00:48.870> hours<00:00:49.260> were<00:00:49.500> very<00:00:49.829> connected<00:00:50.219> is

my<00:01:06.570> was<00:01:07.020> my<00:01:07.049> first<00:01:07.470> question<00:01:07.920> if<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.460> device<00:01:08.820> is

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
my was my first question if a device is

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.510 
my was my first question if a device is
so<00:01:09.270> thin<00:01:09.680> how's<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.890> feedback<00:01:11.250> from<00:01:11.400> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
so thin how's the feedback from the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.700 
so thin how's the feedback from the
keyboard<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.140> actually<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.170> tell<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.560> one

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
keyboard and actually I tell you one

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.520 
keyboard and actually I tell you one
thing<00:01:13.740> this<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.990> best<00:01:16.200> keyboard

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
thing this is this is the best keyboard

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.149 
thing this is this is the best keyboard
I've<00:01:16.799> ever<00:01:17.009> ever<00:01:17.130> had<00:01:17.549> on<00:01:17.759> any<00:01:18.060> netbook<00:01:18.570> or

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
I've ever ever had on any netbook or

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.890 
I've ever ever had on any netbook or
smoke<00:01:20.159> or<00:01:20.280> whatever<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:20.850> forth<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.509> far<00:01:21.689> in

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
this form factor so even my even my anti

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.080 
this form factor so even my even my anti
channels<00:01:25.200> are<00:01:25.320> competing<00:01:25.830> with<00:01:26.159> this

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
channels are competing with this

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.569 
channels are competing with this
keyboard<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:28.350> really<00:01:28.829> really<00:01:29.070> cool<00:01:29.340> feedback

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
keyboard so really really cool feedback

keyboard so really really cool feedback
and<00:01:30.439> you<00:01:31.439> can<00:01:31.590> see<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:31.860> huge<00:01:32.189> track<00:01:32.670> that

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
and you can see this huge track that

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.690 
and you can see this huge track that
with<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.479> integrated<00:01:33.960> mouse<00:01:34.140> buttons<00:01:34.700> and

with the integrated mouse buttons and

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.789 
with the integrated mouse buttons and
let's<00:01:36.180> take<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.420> quick<00:01:36.750> look<00:01:36.960> before<00:01:37.470> we

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
let's take a quick look before we

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.200 
let's take a quick look before we
chicken<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.189> look<00:01:38.310> around<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.759> system<00:01:38.970> and

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
chicken and look around the system and

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.450 
chicken and look around the system and
all<00:01:39.360> its<00:01:39.509> connectors<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.619> know<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.979> little<00:01:41.189> gas

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
all its connectors you know a little gas

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.490 
all its connectors you know a little gas
room<00:01:41.670> over<00:01:42.420> here<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:42.990> they<00:01:43.110> have<00:01:43.409> an

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
room over here so they have an

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
room over here so they have an
integrated<00:01:43.799> USB<00:01:44.130> stick
