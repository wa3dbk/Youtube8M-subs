00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 Talk nerdy that android back here 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.400
 then the people with more the commander 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.189
 For you know that I have the command 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.830
 called i ching wells made by trike 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.110
 hit him and I think I can 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.679
 consider type 1 if it were a block look 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.940
 roof 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.320
 only it works as if it were the one 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.330
 since they want you to 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.699
 and this is not quite a style I found 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.050
 very good idea is the following idea was 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.250
 place the command here then with 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.320
 any look on the floor 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.359
 he is also an extensive guy is good 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.090
 to put this fast is what works it is 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.980
 type them one in the compact scheme but not 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.309
 So compact is the size of the 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.260
 old command looks campaign very much 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.969
 extensive or more important 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.370
 that stallone is what matters now is 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.680
 that works this command is as follows 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.809
 You come here with the cauldron on the floor. 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.210
 Do you drink water? 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:53.489
 hence you need now a took 10 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:56.640
 same mall shopping 01 bar xp without giving 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.100
 some more of her to me the egg I take 20 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.649
 A little over 20 is fine I'm good here 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.769
 in full pot okay and lower 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.689
 he gives me this particle here and now I 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.250
 Can I use pass now as if it were? 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.290
 a little wish I always wanted to play 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.850
 a gold on top it will give us 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.850
 something is good or bad're td in itÃ¡ 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.670
 a very amateur diamond thing to 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.890
 play it happen right of and this 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.890
 problem and bad thing comes I'm not so 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.049
 screwed so good come here killed so good 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.630
 Look, I only liked two more water levels. 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.579
 to play another one more goal here is just to see 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.390
 the diamond for me man and now in 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:39.630
 Our policy matthew our galera that 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.479
 For let our hand stay calm and 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.390
 repeated to not believe old 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.619
 not want to die not want to die killed 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.110
 whoa this ever comes to mind the 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.670
 itr is that until it is good and mana 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.890
 I thought it was not so 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.020
 hard boss not boot is more than a lot 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.939
 people here because I did not get to 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.439
 test everyone but who came and for me 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.040
 it was not were not so bad so did not 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.780
 face 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.270
 I'll add another one here guys 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.350
 now I came back here the following year and 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.020
 It bothers that I do not know if it is too much. 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.489
 heavy the siec buckley you know that I 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.840
 I need a place of ram 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.350
 But he's also a little heavy on me. 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.450
 do not stand 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.790
 what face is a command connected on the mat 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.560
 locked so one more taking advantage here 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.330
 the following here is another version 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.250
 of the command you can use to 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.200
 put under the blackrock so it's good 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.240
 to be at home with them 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.010
 things on top of the world ok let's go 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.390
 get here so I remembered that I made the 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.920
 registration for the two commands to the 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.780
 normal that stays on top also the care 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.480
 It's rocky waves here so lets 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.870
 condemn here we will fill with water and 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.200
 played a lot and deserves a pacifier xp right here 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.600
 A download here works great. 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:50.730
 playing the gold then do not accept 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:53.400
 whoa does not come by fire're beauty 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.690
 It was nice to see your mother, 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.700
 Here came to me now what's another 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.530
 The one I'm going to try 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.850
 test here again only from the other 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.890
 a goal for me instead 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.960
 Let's test win a new bug right 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.370
 hopefully not hugh dancy thing plus one 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.610
 instead see how it works 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:15.260
 Let's put it here again game mode 0 x 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:21.450
 50 good xp pipe try again now 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:23.790
 O good work came in and lowered're the 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.850
 to see the one who is that rabbit who 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:30.000
 kills is that it was taken after the good 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:33.150
 see then see that came a turn 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.860
 Nothing special, but a sword. 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.020
 you're welcome too 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.780
 but now this is the cauldron then the 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.910
 of desire is he has very little 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.960
 things everything I've done or desire 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.910
 it's not just 28 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.530
 only that the developer says he is 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.380
 half lazy and did not want to do others 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.880
 five ne's and then stands for 23 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.620
 it is much more than a black block but 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.170
 I think this is a good idea. 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.580
 desires and effect in the cauldron and also 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.410
 gives us something useful that people 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.710
 can do with gold in addition to both 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.540
 gold 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.280
 I think we do is some rays with 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.860
 and with gold and such but this use that I 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.840
 I find more direct net bush and the resource is 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.630
 much better than doing what to do 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.850
 rivers to preserve the inscription 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.500
 then command the version two versions to 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.550
 first you stay put in 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.720
 top same rank 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.359
 only my county because it is very 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.340
 compact is quite extensive and it falls can 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.080
 end around breaking something in your 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.850
 Your world is also under the command 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.320
 that is underneath the blackrock that I 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.070
 I think he's one for you 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.930
 now please get married 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.970
 this command then come back here was to see 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.800
 in the video and tell me if it's crashing 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.330
 for you too or not or abandoned 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.850
 to grow even it's all got to 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.830
 provide RAM or upload what 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.810
 Is it really the beauty problem then? 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.860
 I hope you have enjoyed the video and that's it. 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.860
 Okay, people said
