00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:08.340
 wow that was the hand of a Serb 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.320
 the gods of choice have touched me are telling me 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.889
 go ahead and leave this torture 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.049
 position is i-7 let him amuse a soup 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.550
 not for this he created real 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.550
 assault gun 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:35.760
 hello my dear viewer and this 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.520
 final video about borsch with top 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.850
 the barrel in this video, I will show all the same 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.370
 how can you tilt aggressively 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.030
 opponents just break everything here 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.790
 in half 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.570
 the fact is that our top gun on 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.640
 Goldian does not work wonders 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.850
 forget about his major flaw 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.110
 long recharge and what all the same 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.620
 armor piercing yes we break through the principle 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:04.320
 not bad 212 but sometimes it is missing and 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.229
 when you merge several times in a row 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.799
 you just have a bunch on you 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:14.580
 you charge fu gold and go ahead 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:17.940
 it is something like this here and here 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.990
 happened here i destroy the royal 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:24.330
 tiger thanks to the light of the allies and i 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.920
 I understand that at least we have a better team 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.110
 than the opponent about this 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.710
 inadequate so i have to go here 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.080
 forward 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.130
 push through because i will inspect what 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:38.490
 makes our cts right from the third we already have 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.500
 dies now and everything and anyone here 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.620
 either we throw this direction and 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.950
 back either borsch and here it just takes and 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:49.290
 attack so why on with the third come down 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.690
 it does n't matter to us 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.100
 but although in principle I can also say 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.960
 that from the guard came here answered me 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.750
 offer to answer for gold but in 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.050
 I don't care if I shoot gold and 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:09.720
 because i want so i can imagine it 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:12.780
 let by the way notice me 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:17.040
 from 3 did not break it and think about it 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.050
 and here I see that we need to help 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.780
 because he got out at all under all 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.120
 trunks why he did it, I see the most 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.390
 disgusting opponent who can 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.310
 only be for borsch save as a 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.160
 it turns out that I kind of backed but tt 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.170
 in fact he could me and both 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.380
 even if it comes and already hide behind 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.990
 pebble well why can it be done and so 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.640
 stand here ok hyosung gt between 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.890
 nobody punches just cool 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.900
 it turns out like I backed it 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.840
 ugly on the one hand and on the other 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.200
 sides and what did he do there? 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.120
 Okay, let's drop this moment, but not 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.070
 less we have strands and there is no longer left 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.030
 Of course it's a shame to spend gold shell 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:01.400
 on 3 lush third isa well what is there 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.490
 nothing can be done could 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.290
 of course charge the bomb and here here 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.930
 kv-2 here I don't exactly go to it 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.120
 will i can go to apt-5 on apt-2 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.300
 itâ€™s better not to be just a blower to it right away 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.180
 there will be a hangar we do not hold a blow therefore 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.880
 there will be fu damage from a land mine behind me 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.180
 cover up two hulks then well done guys 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.790
 but it's full to you 5 is all this just 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.220
 this file you need to do something with it because 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.400
 that hellkat and still do not understand 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.050
 arta remember fails luckily 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.000
 have to divert a little attention to 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.570
 a shot of 700 35 units 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.280
 KV -5 strength immediately understood the meaning of the game 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.440
 turns around on me I'm taking advantage 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.670
 I am leaving by relief 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.340
 hulk gives him a shot at him 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.260
 turns to 5 I understand that 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.330
 hellcata must be saved because he 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.450
 got out distracted attention specially 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:56.060
 so that I can finish him and me 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.100
 manages everything perfectly broke up here 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.140
 heavy tanks in principle is the direction 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.780
 pressed but we are not so fabulous 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.850
 how i wish i gleamed from art i 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.450
 I understand that you have to keep your pants here 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:11.060
 we get a decisive advantage in 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.830
 in principle, in principle, everything is good with us 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.140
 from hulk then dodge me 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:18.980
 already rammed it once with me enough 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:21.350
 one time the more severely damaged 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.440
 climbing up each other see what's needed 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:27.470
 rescue lev urgently here 2 hellcats 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.919

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:33.020
 thanks me dude thanks so much i get it 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:36.290
 what here thirty thirty if not now 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:39.669
 tilt your back bump by more than 700 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:41.539
 units then everything will be very bad fine 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.700
 hellkat them and helps 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:45.410
 and finishes him well done guys all 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.280
 great saved a lot that's there 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.690
 glows on the opposite end 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.720
 thanks to which, in principle, we keep 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.460
 two flank here trying 40 threesome 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.470
 disassemble our 40 top four which 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.240
 Generally 40 foursome not understandable that makes 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.580
 how does she behave in the course of this 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.010
 because he rode all the way 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:07.340
 there at the base and even now did not leave 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:10.669
 I covered him with art and we will stay three of us in 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:13.810
 In principle, in principle, the position but for us 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:17.180
 but do not forget about the free borscht 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:20.780
 which can mess things up if i 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:23.780
 I will play somehow badly the guys will stay 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:26.570
 two in two and it will be sad I see 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.220
 hellcat well done went to pick up the arta I 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.760
 here for the purpose of his you this place because 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.669
 as 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.380
 in principle, it is necessary to have to ditch artu 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:35.660
 you understand there is not enough drawing square 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:40.690
 by the way already charged land mines and food for 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:43.820
 soup turn around and go to the top and 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:47.300

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:49.010

 Well, on this I have all the guys fight 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:04.910
 turned out great borscht can behave 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:07.700
 very very aggressive but only for 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.169
 this need a top barrel subscribe 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.479
