00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.420 
so as you can see I can choose to fire
the<00:03:18.310> gun<00:03:18.340> as<00:03:18.700> long<00:03:18.880> as<00:03:19.030> I<00:03:19.120> want<00:03:19.890> because<00:03:20.890> it's

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
the gun as long as I want because it's

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.000 
the gun as long as I want because it's
got<00:03:21.610> a<00:03:21.640> speed<00:03:22.570> control<00:03:22.690> variable<00:03:23.320> skip<00:03:23.590> speed

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
got a speed control variable skip speed

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.800 
got a speed control variable skip speed
control<00:03:24.340> there<00:03:24.520> we've<00:03:25.060> had<00:03:25.270> a<00:03:25.300> second

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
control there we've had a second

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.690 
control there we've had a second
throttle<00:03:26.200> channel<00:03:26.530> I<00:03:26.620> can<00:03:26.800> all<00:03:26.980> obviously

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
throttle channel I can all obviously

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.570 
throttle channel I can all obviously
control<00:03:28.240> the<00:03:28.840> rate<00:03:29.050> of<00:03:29.230> fire<00:03:29.410> but<00:03:29.440> I<00:03:29.950> think<00:03:30.490> a

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
control the rate of fire but I think a

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.430 
control the rate of fire but I think a
constant<00:03:31.120> speed<00:03:31.240> of<00:03:31.390> fire<00:03:31.660> is<00:03:31.810> okay<00:03:32.140> at<00:03:32.230> the

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
constant speed of fire is okay at the

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:43.920 
constant speed of fire is okay at the
pull<00:03:32.680> of<00:03:32.800> a<00:03:33.250> gear<00:03:34.030> auxilary<00:03:34.600> channel<00:03:42.690> close<00:03:43.690> up

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
pull of a gear auxilary channel close up

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.810 
pull of a gear auxilary channel close up
to<00:03:44.110> the<00:03:44.200> gun<00:03:44.440> dinner's<00:03:44.890> maybe<00:03:45.310> you<00:03:45.430> can<00:03:45.580> see

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
to the gun dinner's maybe you can see

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:54.000 
to the gun dinner's maybe you can see
all<00:03:46.360> the<00:03:47.220> gears<00:03:48.220> running<00:03:52.740> there's<00:03:53.740> a<00:03:53.800> bit<00:03:53.920> of

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
all the gears running there's a bit of

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.410 
all the gears running there's a bit of
recoil<00:03:54.570> but<00:03:56.100> that's<00:03:57.100> a<00:03:57.220> cool<00:03:57.400> little<00:03:57.430> toy

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
recoil but that's a cool little toy

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.360 
recoil but that's a cool little toy
I<00:03:59.040> believe<00:04:00.040> it<00:04:00.250> outperforms<00:04:00.970> any<00:04:01.890> RC<00:04:02.890> tank<00:04:03.190> out

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
I believe it outperforms any RC tank out

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.680 
I believe it outperforms any RC tank out
there<00:04:04.140> being<00:04:05.140> only<00:04:05.290> one<00:04:05.530> shot<00:04:06.270> this<00:04:07.270> thing<00:04:07.330> is

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
there being only one shot this thing is

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.820 
there being only one shot this thing is
fully<00:04:08.080> automatic<00:04:09.180> a<00:04:10.180> lot<00:04:10.870> quicker<00:04:11.110> more

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
fully automatic a lot quicker more

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.570 
fully automatic a lot quicker more
mobile<00:04:12.220> and<00:04:13.230> pretty<00:04:14.230> darn<00:04:14.500> robust<00:04:14.980> I've<00:04:15.370> hit

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
mobile and pretty darn robust I've hit

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.060 
mobile and pretty darn robust I've hit
this<00:04:15.700> thing<00:04:15.840> against<00:04:16.840> the<00:04:16.930> curb<00:04:17.230> so<00:04:17.859> many

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
this thing against the curb so many

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.580 
this thing against the curb so many
times<00:04:18.370> it's<00:04:18.640> not<00:04:18.760> even<00:04:18.970> funny

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
times it's not even funny

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.230 
times it's not even funny
and<00:04:20.590> it's<00:04:20.830> survived<00:04:21.370> throughout<00:04:21.820> the<00:04:22.000> years

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
and it's survived throughout the years

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.770 
and it's survived throughout the years
probably<00:04:23.140> had<00:04:23.410> it<00:04:23.530> for<00:04:23.650> twenty<00:04:23.919> years<00:04:23.950> and

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
probably had it for twenty years and

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.930 
probably had it for twenty years and
finally<00:04:25.780> built<00:04:26.470> her<00:04:26.620> back<00:04:26.830> up<00:04:27.070> again<00:04:27.370> it's<00:04:27.820> one

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
finally built her back up again it's one

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.980 
finally built her back up again it's one
of<00:04:28.030> those<00:04:28.120> sentimental<00:04:28.810> value

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
of those sentimental value

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.830 
of those sentimental value
projects<00:04:31.990> that<00:04:32.050> tend<00:04:32.830> to<00:04:32.950> linger<00:04:33.160> with<00:04:33.400> you<00:04:33.840> so

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
projects that tend to linger with you so

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.490 
projects that tend to linger with you so
I'm<00:04:35.110> sure<00:04:35.290> some<00:04:35.740> of<00:04:35.830> you<00:04:35.919> out<00:04:35.950> there<00:04:36.780> can<00:04:37.780> find

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
I'm sure some of you out there can find

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.550 
I'm sure some of you out there can find
a<00:04:38.560> common<00:04:38.770> ground<00:04:39.070> with<00:04:39.250> what<00:04:39.430> I<00:04:39.460> mean<00:04:40.560> anyway

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560
