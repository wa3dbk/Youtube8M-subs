00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.560 

so<00:01:52.830> in<00:01:53.040> this<00:01:53.159> tutorial<00:01:53.220> we'll<00:01:54.000> be<00:01:54.210> using<00:01:56.570> the

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
so in this tutorial we'll be using the

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.320 
so in this tutorial we'll be using the
mix<00:01:57.900> texture<00:01:58.500> node<00:01:58.680> which<00:01:59.070> haven't<00:02:00.030> gone<00:02:00.180> into

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
mix texture node which haven't gone into

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.100 
mix texture node which haven't gone into
detail<00:02:00.570> but<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.740> good<00:02:01.950> way<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.760> you

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
detail but this is a good way to you

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.660 
detail but this is a good way to you
experiment<00:02:04.110> so<00:02:04.770> first<00:02:05.130> we're<00:02:05.340> going<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.520> make

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
experiment so first we're going to make

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.470 
experiment so first we're going to make
a<00:02:06.000> diffuse<00:02:07.340> for<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.399> ground<00:02:11.060> so<00:02:12.060> connected<00:02:12.450> to

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
a diffuse for the ground so connected to

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.830 
a diffuse for the ground so connected to
the<00:02:12.569> fuse<00:02:12.810> up<00:02:13.340> put<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.459> here<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:15.600> we're<00:02:15.750> going

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
the fuse up put it here and we're going

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.800 
the fuse up put it here and we're going
to<00:02:15.900> make<00:02:16.050> another<00:02:16.760> diffuse<00:02:17.760> this<00:02:18.480> is<00:02:18.630> going<00:02:18.750> to

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
to make another diffuse this is going to

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.960 
to make another diffuse this is going to
be<00:02:18.900> for<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.140> lighting<00:02:21.830> as<00:02:22.830> you<00:02:23.040> can<00:02:23.160> see<00:02:23.370> then

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
be for the lighting as you can see then

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.160 
be for the lighting as you can see then
we're<00:02:24.239> going<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.540> add<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:26.420> missions<00:02:27.420> of<00:02:27.750> texture

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
we're going to add a missions of texture

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.080 
we're going to add a missions of texture
division<00:02:28.530> put<00:02:28.800> that<00:02:29.100> to<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.280> blue<00:02:29.580> one<00:02:29.850> and

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
division put that to the blue one and

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.420 
division put that to the blue one and
that<00:02:30.420> should<00:02:30.660> be<00:02:30.780> very<00:02:30.989> bright<00:02:32.870> okay<00:02:34.010> so<00:02:35.010> now

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
and as you can see the absorption is red

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:45.119 
and as you can see the absorption is red
and<00:03:40.349> everything<00:03:41.349> else<00:03:41.500> is<00:03:41.709> black<00:03:44.010> so<00:03:45.010> yeah

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
absorbing all this light because it's a

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.869 
absorbing all this light because it's a
kind<00:03:50.500> of<00:03:50.560> translucent<00:03:51.540> translucent<00:03:52.540> ish<00:03:52.840> now

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
kind of translucent translucent ish now

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:56.580 
kind of translucent translucent ish now
to<00:03:54.879> get<00:03:55.060> a<00:03:55.209> better<00:03:55.510> effect<00:03:55.720> on<00:03:56.140> this<00:03:56.319> to<00:03:56.500> get

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590

to get a better effect on this to get
rid<00:03:56.739> of<00:03:56.799> the<00:03:56.890> glossy<00:03:57.459> feeling<00:03:57.910> I<00:03:58.920> just<00:03:59.920> click

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:00.129 
rid of the glossy feeling I just click

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:01.380 
rid of the glossy feeling I just click
on<00:04:00.160> the<00:04:00.310> material<00:04:00.730> so<00:04:00.849> you<00:04:00.940> don't<00:04:01.060> have<00:04:01.180> to<00:04:01.299> go

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
on the material so you don't have to go

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.740 
on the material so you don't have to go
to<00:04:01.450> material<00:04:02.019> I<00:04:02.200> got<00:04:02.980> rid<00:04:03.159> of<00:04:03.190> the<00:04:03.750> roughness

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
to material I got rid of the roughness

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.920 
to material I got rid of the roughness
on<00:04:05.019> the<00:04:05.260> specular<00:04:05.709> material<00:04:06.190> and<00:04:06.780> made<00:04:07.780> it

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
on the specular material and made it

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:14.309 
on the specular material and made it
more<00:04:08.220> kind<00:04:09.220> of<00:04:09.340> like<00:04:11.040> skin<00:04:12.040> skin<00:04:13.000> type<00:04:13.329> fish<00:04:13.900> if

more kind of like skin skin type fish if

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.900 
more kind of like skin skin type fish if
that<00:04:14.500> makes<00:04:14.709> any<00:04:14.799> sense<00:04:17.430> that's<00:04:18.430> pretty<00:04:18.760> much

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
that makes any sense that's pretty much

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.610 
that makes any sense that's pretty much
the<00:04:18.970> only<00:04:19.209> settings<00:04:19.780> you<00:04:19.870> should<00:04:20.260> mess<00:04:20.590> with

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
the only settings you should mess with

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:26.909 
the only settings you should mess with
in<00:04:20.979> the<00:04:21.070> specter<00:04:21.430> specula<00:04:25.380> yeah<00:04:26.380> get<00:04:26.710> rid<00:04:26.830> of

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
in the specter specula yeah get rid of

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.790 
in the specter specula yeah get rid of
that

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.480 

angular<00:04:30.699> that<00:04:30.940> and<00:04:31.830> let's<00:04:32.830> go<00:04:32.949> back<00:04:33.220> and<00:04:33.430> make

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
angular that and let's go back and make

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.249 
angular that and let's go back and make
this<00:04:33.610> is<00:04:33.759> skin<00:04:34.030> color<00:04:34.270> now<00:04:34.479> since<00:04:34.750> we've<00:04:34.960> seen

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:35.259 
this is skin color now since we've seen

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:39.689 
this is skin color now since we've seen
it<00:04:36.360> skin<00:04:37.360> colors<00:04:37.629> around<00:04:37.949> some<00:04:38.949> /<00:04:39.159> brownish

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
it skin colors around some / brownish

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:49.830 
it skin colors around some / brownish
orange

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.780 

and<00:04:49.930> you<00:04:50.740> can<00:04:50.889> also<00:04:51.070> change<00:04:51.280> the<00:04:51.400> color<00:04:51.699> of

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
and you can also change the color of

00:04:51.790 --> 00:05:00.790 
and you can also change the color of
this<00:04:51.970> to<00:04:52.240> to<00:04:53.199> the<00:04:53.290> same<00:04:53.500> color<00:04:53.830> of<00:04:53.980> this

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:09.430 

so<00:05:01.430> we're<00:05:01.550> playing<00:05:01.819> for<00:05:03.490> 170<00:05:05.830> third<00:05:06.830> point<00:05:08.440> for

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
so we're playing for 170 third point for

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:15.189 
so we're playing for 170 third point for
17<00:05:10.129> and<00:05:12.430> yeah<00:05:13.430> that<00:05:13.970> looks<00:05:14.150> pretty<00:05:14.479> sick

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199 
17 and yeah that looks pretty sick

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:23.119 
17 and yeah that looks pretty sick
actually<00:05:17.080> now<00:05:18.080> um

00:05:23.119 --> 00:05:23.129 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:25.579 

do<00:05:23.969> anything<00:05:24.270> so<00:05:24.779> yet<00:05:24.989> try<00:05:25.289> and<00:05:25.439> mess<00:05:25.559> around

do anything so yet try and mess around
some<00:05:26.279> of<00:05:26.309> the<00:05:26.459> parameters<00:05:27.319> let's<00:05:28.319> just<00:05:28.679> have<00:05:29.009> a

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 
some of the parameters let's just have a

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:32.089 
some of the parameters let's just have a
quick<00:05:29.429> that<00:05:30.059> just<00:05:30.270> raises<00:05:30.479> up<00:05:30.989> good<00:05:31.679> crazier

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:32.099 
quick that just raises up good crazier

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:41.519 
quick that just raises up good crazier
this<00:05:33.019> see<00:05:34.019> how<00:05:34.169> far<00:05:34.439> we<00:05:34.649> can<00:05:34.679> go

00:05:41.519 --> 00:05:41.529 

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:53.620 

and<00:05:41.619> it's<00:05:42.399> put<00:05:42.699> it<00:05:42.819> in<00:05:42.909> pmc

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:06:00.750 

and<00:05:55.990> it's<00:05:56.990> also<00:05:57.230> yet<00:05:58.210> nice<00:05:59.210> rendering<00:05:59.480> out

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760 
and it's also yet nice rendering out

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.610 
and it's also yet nice rendering out
nice<00:06:01.760> actually<00:06:02.360> looking<00:06:03.080> pretty<00:06:03.110> good<00:06:03.380> say<00:06:03.560> as

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
nice actually looking pretty good say as

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.460 
nice actually looking pretty good say as
you<00:06:03.710> can<00:06:03.860> see<00:06:04.100> it's<00:06:04.730> been<00:06:05.110> the<00:06:06.110> last<00:06:06.290> being

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:06.470 
you can see it's been the last being

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.430 
you can see it's been the last being
sucked<00:06:06.830> in<00:06:07.070> around<00:06:07.610> here<00:06:07.940> and<00:06:08.270> that's<00:06:09.230> been

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 
sucked in around here and that's been

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.600 
sucked in around here and that's been
sucked<00:06:09.710> into<00:06:09.860> here<00:06:11.380> in<00:06:12.380> essence<00:06:12.770> doing<00:06:13.520> a

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
sucked into here in essence doing a

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:20.590 
sucked into here in essence doing a
shitload<00:06:13.940> of<00:06:16.810> path<00:06:19.180> balances<00:06:20.180> and<00:06:20.300> paths

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:20.600 
shitload of path balances and paths

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.870 
shitload of path balances and paths
through<00:06:20.930> the<00:06:21.080> specular<00:06:22.010> which<00:06:22.520> is<00:06:22.670> also

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 
through the specular which is also

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.090 
through the specular which is also
glossy<00:06:23.540> it's<00:06:24.140> going<00:06:24.320> to<00:06:24.380> take<00:06:24.470> a<00:06:24.530> long<00:06:24.830> time

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:25.100 
glossy it's going to take a long time

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:32.670 
glossy it's going to take a long time
and<00:06:25.490> going<00:06:26.090> to<00:06:26.180> need<00:06:26.330> a<00:06:26.360> lot<00:06:26.750> of<00:06:27.460> samples

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:32.680 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.110 

because<00:06:33.680> once<00:06:33.980> you<00:06:34.100> see<00:06:34.280> those<00:06:34.430> blotches<00:06:34.940> you

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 
because once you see those blotches you

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.880 
because once you see those blotches you

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:40.250 
while plastics are really hard to

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.900 
while plastics are really hard to
calculate<00:06:41.800> need<00:06:42.800> a<00:06:42.860> brute-force<00:06:43.340> algorithm

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:43.910 
calculate need a brute-force algorithm

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.810

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:46.820 
to do it and about a thousand cuticles

to do it and about a thousand cuticles
which<00:06:47.810> is<00:06:47.960> minimum<00:06:48.410> all<00:06:49.370> right<00:06:49.490> so<00:06:49.730> I'm<00:06:49.760> not

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:50.150 
which is minimum all right so I'm not

nice I'm in like this texture not the
actual<00:07:13.999> model<00:07:15.279> I'm<00:07:16.279> cool<00:07:16.520> like<00:07:16.699> that<00:07:16.759> alright

this until the a true sub sir scattering

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:31.689 
this until the a true sub sir scattering
is<00:07:27.110> implemented<00:07:27.830> thank<00:07:28.699> you<00:07:28.909> and<00:07:29.149> see<00:07:29.659> you
