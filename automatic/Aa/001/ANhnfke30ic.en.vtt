00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.880
 hello very good to all welcome to 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.940
 your house welcome to rj we are in 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.530
 the mobile world congress 2014 stand 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.570
 We are going to talk a little bit about the 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.480
 firefox or is the operating system of 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:18.219
 mozilla based on html5 let's tell you 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.219
 all of the terminal open c 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.189
 let's start with the design of this 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:26.610
 true opc mushroom that are terminal 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.210
 with firefox or is with a screen 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.490
 relatively large so we're 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.710
 used inside from within 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.059
 this operating system 4 inches from to 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.530
 which we will only do a little more 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:37.390
 go ahead in this case as you see in 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.760
 different colors we have it in blue in 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.800
 red in orange and in blue we have 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.530
 selected the most corporate angel the 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.820
 more similar to the backpack let's see 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.339
 as always a little review of the law of 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.350
 notifications we have a speaker and in 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:51.640
 the bottom as always inside 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.410
 this operating system only 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.390
 we have a central button that makes the 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.190
 home solutions and directly we 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.780
 leads to the search engine we are going to 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.129
 move and we will see one of the 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.399
 side we have a metallic finish 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:06.550
 volume control let's see the part 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:09.130
 top 3.5 jack and the button for 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.080
 unlock the device and in the other 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.810
 lateral we found a singing 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.060
 totally smooth the bottom 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.890
 microusb connection with which we are going to 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.320
 to be able to withdraw we will be able to load the 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.920
 terminal and through this notch we're going 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.869
 to be able to remove the back cover 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.210
 on its back we only find ourselves 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.340
 in the operating system that incorporates and 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.890
 in the upper part the camera in this 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.869
 case which lacks front flash 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.399
 good as you can imagine most 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.189
 of firefox terminals webs have a 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.659
 jaguar really short enough 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.250
 quite limited nonetheless in this 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.009
 case they have opted for a processor 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.890
 snapdragon 200 specifically is a dual 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.840
 core that runs at 1.2 gigahertz as 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.490
 you see the issue of fluency is a 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.500
 wonder is very operative but that 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.780
 very young but as we see in quotes 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.319
 it's not too bad besides this we're going 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.630
 to have 512 megabytes of ram and for the 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:02.399
 storage section we will have 4 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.470
 gigas we remember that this device 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.590
 has the possibility to expand them 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.179
 using microsd cards the battery a 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.950
 important aspect is true that it is a 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.530
 device not too big not 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.319
 we need a very generous battery in 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.150
 this case 1400 milliamps touches the 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.040
 turn of the most important aspect of this 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.260
 video is to talk about the operating system is 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.239
 talk about firefox or it's like you all know 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.250
 the operating system of mozilla del 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.780
 search engine especially the 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.070
 main virtue that this system has 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.580
 operative we have already said that it is very 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.410
 young 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.480
 but it's based on the web all 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.780
 the applications everything is created in 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.100
 html5 applications that are very light and 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.900
 who knows if this may be the future 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.340
 of mobile applications we are going to give 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.260
 a little walk for those who do not 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.940
 you know in the lower part we have 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.400
 a small dock in which we will be able to 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.890
 place different applications like 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.750
 we see let's go into the day read 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.740
 we enter a section of the messages 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.780
 also for you to see a little 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.300
 load times a section of the 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.310
 camera 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.070
 directly the search engine you can not other 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.780
 way in this case firefox a bit to 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.880
 that you see the speed we could even 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.280
 include some we should only 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.620
 press the drag and in a very 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.600
 simple let's be able to access this to 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.760
 this two we're going to go to the top 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.890
 and we are going to move this bar 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.720
 notifications in which we will be able to 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.790
 appreciate notifications in the case 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.070
 that we had a memory available 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.870
 ram that we have free in which if 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.640
 we access it takes us a section of 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.410
 storage to be able to see 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.810
 exactly what are we spending our 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.550
 memory and from here in the part 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.710
 inferior a little similar to android 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.510
 we have an energy control from the 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.110
 which will we be able to change to wifi 3g 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.160
 bluetooth and device settings 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.140
 in which we are going to enter 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.150
 Then I liked a lot of 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.830
 firefox or is it that the section of 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.230
 settings is pretty clean pretty 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.060
 simple there's not much where where 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.560
 get lost out of the battery 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.010
 information phone information 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.440
 of memory privacy notifications 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.690
 language sound bluetooth screen the 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.070
 true that a fairly simple way 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.030
 we will be able to calibrate different 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.140
 Actions 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.300
 saying this let's see how 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.100
 interact with firefox or is we have 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.620
 horizontal displacements in 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.730
 desks here we are going to find a 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.010
 absence we do not have a box of 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.200
 applications as such but all the 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.180
 that we go downloading they are going to go 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.950
 including that continuation a detail 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.019
 also interesting is that if we make a 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.950
 shift to the left 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.350
 we come to one of the most 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.910
 important from firefox west and is the 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.270
 power that has its search engine 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.810
 here and even tell us in thinking of 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:35.810
 let's search and if for example we put 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.810
 mozilla 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.580
 let's see what information throws us 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.760
 and we will see the most interesting of all 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.130
 this as you see the screen background even 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.420
 what we are looking for has been adapted and 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.850
 what I loved is that we 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.710
 suggests related information in 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.050
 different makes different options for 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.030
 One part suggests we look for a backpack in 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.860
 your browser suggests us information about 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.850
 mozilla in a country application 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:08.950
 based on html5 excuse also 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.260
 information of this word in the 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.510
 confidential and even suggest us 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.760
 videos on youtube as you see in a way 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.830
 very successful gives us information in 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.510
 different sections and we're going to go into 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.700
 different applications again for 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.530
 that you see a little the speed that has 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.630
 to open them we will enter for example 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:29.800
 in the watch section as you see 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:31.300
 no problem apart from twitter in 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.980
 this case we are connected a 3g network 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.960
 We already tell you that it is not going well 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.460
 so you have it a little bit in mind 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.740
 the truth that we can not do much 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.450
 plus a section of music also own 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.620
 of them we go to another for example the 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.129
 gallery so you can see how it is 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.709
 unwinds 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:47.689
 as you see no problem charged in 

00:05:45.709 --> 00:05:49.489
 html5 we must take this into account 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:51.529
 detail and this gentleman the little walk 

00:05:49.489 --> 00:05:52.729
 by firefox or is the section of the 

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:54.769
 screen is certainly not the most 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:57.559
 important of this open c is a 

00:05:54.769 --> 00:05:59.179
 4 inch screen with technology t 

00:05:57.559 --> 00:06:02.809
 ft the truth that of quite quality 

00:05:59.179 --> 00:06:08.569
 justita the resolution concretely 800 

00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:10.489
 x 480 and leaves us 233 pp the next 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:11.839
 multimedia section is the section of the 

00:06:10.489 --> 00:06:14.269
 camera we are also going to find a 

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:16.550
 pretty trimmed appearance and a camera 

00:06:14.269 --> 00:06:18.349
 of 3 megapixels which we are already told 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.599
 previously we do not have the option 

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:22.849
 from a led flash from here we will be able to 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:24.679
 commute flight take a picture 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:27.199
 in a simple way through the button 

00:06:24.679 --> 00:06:28.759
 it's true that duration is not everything 

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:31.920
 quick that we would like 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:33.870
 we can switch to video mode 

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.480
 and even from here we will be able to 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:38.010
 access fairly quickly to 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.070
 the gallery even here we can see 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:42.510
 some good sample images this 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:44.100
 has been all this has been the review that 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:46.170
 we have given this terminal with a 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:48.210
 Very young operating system very green 

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:50.070
 but who knows maybe he has enough 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.450
 potential as we have always seen that 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.370
 it's a pretty low cost terminal 

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:55.260
 really economic with aspects 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.670
 multimedia very but very fair 

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.720
 We hope you liked this video 

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:59.720
 a greeting
