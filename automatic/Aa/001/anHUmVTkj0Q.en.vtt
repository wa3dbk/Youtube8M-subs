 recovery to such first 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.869
 will relate of course glue and 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.500
 creatine monohydrate creatine other types 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.760
 nitrates other 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:31.439
 he has one meaning that he increases 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:34.290

 very well conducive to push for 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.950
 the growth of power indicators she did not get up 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.640
 only upload a picture once can give 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:55.199
 tangible result but I really anywhere but 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.390
 glue our strength you but many suffer 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.750
 lurking lies, too, creatine 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.000
 precisely many all sorts of acids here caffeine 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.799
 turin so on gives good mood 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.770
 good push takeaway like toning not 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:14.040
 sad in general, that is, print rent 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:18.930
 endurance and strength give unequivocally as 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:21.000
 time his target that briefly if 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.720
 creatine it works with accumulating over 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.700
 all month 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:31.770
 distance to someone with at sim 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:34.140
 drank a couple of hours as I went off the ramp 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.689
 need you know the next moment is 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.890
 simple complex workers 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:40.320
 mean after training complex 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.710
 is a mixture of minerals 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.020
 Donetsk vitamins mixture of individual 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.869
 amino acids such as glutamine gime 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.579
 cities which contributes 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:57.170
 hormone production 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.329
 such there growth hormone test rounds and 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.579
 accelerated and accordingly steel 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.700
 as a consequence of l-carnitine and limited but 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.289
 definitely 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.849
 they assign to force may be new 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:13.060
 meditation on 7 parts the length of the brush even 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:16.830
 more stamina up gives 100 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:21.040
 percent but the passion is gradually said 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:23.650
 good mate especially those who 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.840
 doing bikes jogging all 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.000
 hydrogen loads just before each 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.569
 to good kordi and everyone again 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.840
 beautiful how much farther then what 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.730
 america slots protein biotech 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.319
 by itself does not contribute 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.739
 recovery because they fall into 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:46.510
 organism and map our process to stop 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:49.560
 Vitamin dishes do not judge individual 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.420
 look vitamin gives hair gives 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:57.209
 good restoration beautiful need 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:03:00.010
 happy all feel completely 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.260
 did not sleep the best set 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:08.950
 lily not be banned at 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:11.730
 drawing up feel and red too 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.190
 talked a lot about him 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.380
 start work to growth on accrued 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.069
 our fine when training 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:24.370
 good bank our people blood congratulations 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:26.799
 wipe stop but creates 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.950
 accordingly so karl run 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:32.950
 palm trees but here point b is not 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.910
 proven , they also told 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.650
 detail in brief what is the same in essence 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.739
 one should expect the effect as it is there and not on 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.900
 as well as openly mine that is for the night 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.440
 it starts the hormone production process 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.870
 growth to help burn fat 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.400
 increase mass gain to their such 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.970
 significant quantities but in general 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.590
 contributes often to this they add 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.959
 in before training 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.760
 and after training complex just 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:05.010
 not without reason esoteric 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.290
 but it is a matter of fast carbohydrates 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.879
 instant 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:13.000
 energy but also unkind greeting power 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:16.609
 again to all carbohydrates each and all 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.299
 all this is known as fast Monica 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.370
 again a temporary effect takes place 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.180
 be and 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.570
 you are unlikely to have additional 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.919
 breakthrough but hands will be training 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.949
 short explosive some kind of power can 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:33.139
 some kind of explosive push even in aerobic 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:35.930
 Exercise Well shorter recovery definitely 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:39.349
 will be for tonics so contained there 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:42.440
 faster but also the minerals that decline we 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:53.259
 goes to the regatta already world rosette 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:57.759
 energy recovery by itself 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:05:02.599
 stimulated means ours into our bodies 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:07.720
 Mug sluggish tired to them from coffee shops 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:12.620
 product well that's all the same and stimulating 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:16.090
 recommend the 50s easier clean 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:19.760
 caffeine there or taurine my name is laurent 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:21.500
 pure nutrition sports 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:26.030
 it is desirable to take that without these 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.810
 any additions and famously will not give both houses 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.909
 you have 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:32.560
 energy to the territory is definitely yours 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:35.990
 will push but what if you find out 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:40.099
 not that will give energy and there it is 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:43.669
 will return you the norm to meter worth 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:46.130
 expect leakage neatly to his brigade 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:48.889
 clue where today because after 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:51.010
 stimulation of course 105 so fall 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:55.590
 energy even 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:58.810
 and almost want to rest 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:01.090
 all your shop with a corpse was
