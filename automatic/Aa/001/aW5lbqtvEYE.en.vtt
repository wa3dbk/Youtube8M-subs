00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.280 
without a price I think everyone has
that<00:02:09.130> struggle<00:02:09.519> in<00:02:09.610> themselves<00:02:10.360> about<00:02:10.899> you

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
that struggle in themselves about you

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.570 
that struggle in themselves about you
know<00:02:11.410> that<00:02:11.620> making<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:11.980> right<00:02:12.130> choice<00:02:12.340> doing

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
know that making the right choice doing

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.729 
know that making the right choice doing
the<00:02:12.670> right<00:02:12.819> thing<00:02:13.060> and<00:02:13.810> you<00:02:14.080> feel<00:02:14.260> bad<00:02:14.440> for

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
the right thing and you feel bad for

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.030 
the right thing and you feel bad for
making<00:02:15.310> some<00:02:15.670> choices<00:02:16.230> this<00:02:17.230> I<00:02:17.500> think<00:02:17.890> it's

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
making some choices this I think it's

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.100 
making some choices this I think it's
about<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.370> struggling<00:02:18.790> everyone<00:02:19.269> it's<00:02:19.959> the

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
about the struggling everyone it's the

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.620 
about the struggling everyone it's the
pull<00:02:20.319> of<00:02:20.440> who<00:02:20.920> he<00:02:21.550> is<00:02:21.790> stronger<00:02:22.120> at<00:02:22.300> certain

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
pull of who he is stronger at certain

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.390 
pull of who he is stronger at certain
times<00:02:22.840> in<00:02:23.049> the<00:02:23.110> place<00:02:23.319> which<00:02:23.739> is<00:02:23.920> what<00:02:24.100> makes

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
times in the place which is what makes

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.520 
times in the place which is what makes
it<00:02:24.610> yeah<00:02:25.480> there's<00:02:25.780> not<00:02:25.900> necessarily<00:02:26.049> a<00:02:26.470> right

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
it yeah there's not necessarily a right

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.940 
it yeah there's not necessarily a right
a<00:02:27.100> right<00:02:28.030> path<00:02:28.480> to<00:02:28.930> choose<00:02:29.140> yeah<00:02:29.590> hopefully

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
a right path to choose yeah hopefully

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.000 
a right path to choose yeah hopefully
that<00:02:30.400> that<00:02:30.430> that<00:02:30.940> final<00:02:31.450> 15<00:02:31.840> minutes<00:02:32.110> some

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
that that that final 15 minutes some

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.740 
that that that final 15 minutes some
people<00:02:33.370> will<00:02:33.459> be<00:02:33.489> on<00:02:33.819> a<00:02:33.850> kind<00:02:34.150> of<00:02:34.269> giddy

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
people will be on a kind of giddy

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.840 
people will be on a kind of giddy
adrenaline<00:02:35.470> filled<00:02:35.709> roller<00:02:36.070> coaster<00:02:36.670> with

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
adrenaline filled roller coaster with

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.660 
adrenaline filled roller coaster with
the<00:02:37.030> comedian<00:02:37.329> and<00:02:37.690> some<00:02:38.230> people<00:02:38.560> be<00:02:38.799> in<00:02:39.579> a

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
the comedian and some people be in a

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.030 
the comedian and some people be in a
more<00:02:41.700> excruciating<00:02:43.019> in<00:02:44.019> one<00:02:44.500> way<00:02:44.680> and<00:02:44.950> then

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
more excruciating in one way and then

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.699 
more excruciating in one way and then
another<00:02:45.100> way<00:02:45.489> would<00:02:46.360> just<00:02:46.600> be<00:02:46.720> fireworks<00:02:47.230> I

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
another way would just be fireworks I

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.220 
another way would just be fireworks I
think<00:02:50.709> anybody<00:02:50.920> who<00:02:51.329> does<00:02:52.329> that<00:02:52.600> must<00:02:53.049> have<00:02:53.200> a

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
think anybody who does that must have a

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.199 
think anybody who does that must have a
certain<00:02:53.500> inner<00:02:53.920> strength<00:02:54.250> to<00:02:54.489> just<00:02:54.850> walk<00:02:55.030> on

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
certain inner strength to just walk on

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.140 
certain inner strength to just walk on
stage<00:02:55.390> and<00:02:55.450> do<00:02:56.079> that<00:02:56.260> but<00:02:57.040> I<00:02:57.280> think<00:02:57.400> he's<00:02:57.940> also

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
stage and do that but I think he's also

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.970 
stage and do that but I think he's also
I<00:02:58.750> think<00:02:58.900> he<00:02:59.140> thinks<00:02:59.290> he's<00:02:59.500> stronger<00:02:59.709> than<00:02:59.829> he

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
I think he thinks he's stronger than he

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.880 
I think he thinks he's stronger than he
is<00:03:02.370> and

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
is and

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.360 
is and
and<00:03:06.170> with<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.260> compromises<00:03:07.800> that<00:03:08.100> he<00:03:08.190> does

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
and with the compromises that he does

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.760 
and with the compromises that he does
make<00:03:08.610> they<00:03:09.360> reveal<00:03:09.690> those<00:03:10.020> chinks<00:03:10.500> in<00:03:10.650> the

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
make they reveal those chinks in the

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.800 
make they reveal those chinks in the
armor
