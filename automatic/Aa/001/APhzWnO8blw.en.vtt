 in terminal as you are if I am yo juanjo 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.010
 bilic in correlation with occurring already 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.869
 I saw I bring you what is a gameplay of 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.420
 cinema mode of call of duty modern warfare 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.340
 3 what a good game well we are here in 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.930
 terminal we are in guns game is not 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.730
 you've seen it in the title that I have the 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.740
 game of weapons in a private game not 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.930
 I know if you knew but it has given me 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.820
 an idea and said ostias yes I have 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.410
 people who want to play with me at a 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.300
 call of duty because I do not have 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.340
 the white the two children that are a 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.200
 shit and this one has in some 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.480
 shit and other things but not good 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.890
 so this is my idea and I give you the 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.719
 I comment good before anything was that 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.250
 I was here in this game with the lord 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.350
 dÃ­dac titan that there are letters where below 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.660
 shot was with mister teko tracer 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.730
 I was with the agent and with the 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.890
 tortosa sir so all of them a 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.719
 great greeting of course then let's go 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.510
 in a game of weapons game and I say 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.070
 divine because I like this mode of this 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.570
 so they took it away I do not know why 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.310
 they made that update shit 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.200
 so when I saw it, I said 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.000
 oh my god I love this way of 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.640
 game then I thought that for the 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.110
 400 subscribers would be this Friday 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.990
 when I have uploaded what is the video 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.729
 then you have this time to tell me 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.890
 if you want to play with me in a game 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.409
 of call of duty modern warfare 3 game 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.090
 private in weapons game to see the 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:30.020
 rules because they are those of the game itself 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.429
 obviously then you will see me as 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.259
 I do so that you do not worry 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:35.090
 guys then you can play 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.890
 Well, tell me in the comments, do not tell me 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.020
 It's worth not even on Facebook. 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.580
 twitter is not worth me in the twenty no no 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.709
 son of a bitch the mother who bore you 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.420
 it catches me from behind then those 

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:46.159
 people who want to play with me in 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.049
 a game of weapons game that I what 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.789
 say in the video comment 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.189
 then there to tell people that 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.200
 want to play and then that is not left 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:56.509
 then do not come to me with hey it's that I 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.520
 sent messages such etcetera but perhaps 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.560
 you have left me one in the comment not 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.450
 what sentence then you are not included in 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.340
 the process my friend that's the problem 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.130
 God how good I am with this in this mode 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.929
 then if you want 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.930
 playing as in a private game would be 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.710
 this is Friday afternoon more or 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.720
 less Spanish time from the 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.730
 onwards approximately when I 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.560
 connect then I will start what is the 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.090
 game of weapons in a game of call of 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.400
 duty there are at least three people 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.230
 counting with me then hey look at the 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.820
 I'm going to do with those three people that 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.860
 at the end not so good then we have 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.960
 tried and if not you will already look for my life 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.090
 to do something else from the 400 special 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.130
 subscribers that quiet that all to 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.650
 its due time but at least I'm 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.540
 here trying to get ideas from 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.520
 where I can, you know what the 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.260
 weapon game no or we have 18 weapons 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.080
 so we started with a species like 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.650
 of desert eagle then we had a g 18 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:53.550
 the m-45 then we are going up a bit 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:56.700
 we have it the 1887 it sweeps the msr there 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.760
 There are those people that give you the xm25 which is 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.040
 this throws cucumbers that is the first time 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.080
 that I handle it god is not dead fagot 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.840
 the mother who bore you then then 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.050
 after this of the xm25 the last 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.780
 weapon that we have is to see if you guess not 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:16.230
 it's not a shield it's not no 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:19.140
 it's not any no it's not ladies and 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.640
 Knights and avelino is for me 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.980
 I think he already sees lines 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.110
 the most difficult weapon to handle because 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.330
 there are people who say fuck if the 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.120
 people kill with the bloody javelin and me 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.530
 I try and they do not die I say good if 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.870
 Me too happened to me because then you go 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.170
 to see that he tried to kill a partner 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.480
 Look here is amazing me x 925 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.480
 remember techno 95 but like but in 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.000
 grenade launcher version anything come come 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.350
 come and let them be by grenades then 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.850
 Well, here I'm trying not to 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.440
 everyone who were playing 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.120
 with me I think they were saying 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.220
 fuck joanjo to see if you die already 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.610
 once I see, it's not my fault 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.989
 that comes from coming from the black ops that 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.910
 I'm given the game of weapons and there already 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.190
 you have seen guys how to try to kill 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.200
 jumping very well so I like and here 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.540
 We already have the ultimate weapon that is already 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.570
 abel and then well this is already super 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:13.120
 Fucked because of course you point there and 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:15.430
 well you do not have space to 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.380
 as it is said for 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.840
 to launch what is the projectile 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.400
 this is even harder still then 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.990
 I think it's very funny now that 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.050
 the games last like this one that is 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:29.139
 it lasts approximately 6 minutes 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.389
 a thing like that guys then then I'll do 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:33.699
 a game or two games and it is 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.110
 I do not have any problem that then that 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:37.030
 there are people like I said there are people 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.520
 who wants to play with me this game and 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.810
 that in the end there are only two people 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.020
 good to the best game good those two 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.669
 not the people do not know and I record what I see 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.050
 that maybe there are three four or five or 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:48.849
 six people who have signed up for 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.530
 I am and look better than better I will do it 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:51.820
 little more fun and you're 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.500
 do not worry guys that I 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.699
 leave me the magic good and you see that 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.280
 it's the cinema mode that I've already said 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:58.810
 above damn 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.759
 so then that's what my idea is 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.860
 of 400 special subscribers that 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:04.810
 can make it perfect that you can not 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.330
 do well then nothing happens I will try 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.880
 look for other ideas and point there goes the one of 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.440
 abel and then I do not know why not no 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.110
 kill but good here I was 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.430
 posting everywhere with all your 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.410
 weapons or I think there was there is a 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.169
 weapons orgy were all the 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.889
 shotguns all guns rifles and 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:24.039
 submachine guns 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:26.499
 the snipers here were 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:28.479
 giving a beating of 15 and saying but 

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:29.860
 well let's see good when I play 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:31.779
 to the game I say but let's see 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.969
 gentlemen what is going on here that I what 

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:35.949
 normal good the normal in a game of 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:37.810
 game of weapons is that it goes well but 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:40.389
 good as everything in this good life there 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.460

 I do not like the patrol car and of course it's 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.060

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.490
