00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
which is pretty nice there is this

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.600 
which is pretty nice there is this
slightly<00:01:37.140> awkward<00:01:37.409> divider<00:01:38.189> between<00:01:38.400> the

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
slightly awkward divider between the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
it's probably gonna be at this island

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.149 
it's probably gonna be at this island
stool<00:01:44.909> place<00:01:45.270> here<00:01:45.570> or<00:01:46.229> I'll<00:01:46.380> just<00:01:46.590> be<00:01:46.770> eating

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
stool place here or I'll just be eating

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.710 
stool place here or I'll just be eating
at<00:01:47.579> home<00:01:47.790> or<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.060> don't<00:01:48.149> even<00:01:48.390> know<00:01:48.479> what's

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
at home or I don't even know what's

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.850 
at home or I don't even know what's
going<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.899> happen<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:49.649> that's<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.799> little

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
going to happen that so that's a little

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.289 
going to happen that so that's a little
bit<00:01:50.040> awkward<00:01:50.310> it's<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.520> fun<00:01:50.670> place<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.850> jump<00:01:51.149> up

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
bit awkward it's a fun place to jump up

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.109 
bit awkward it's a fun place to jump up
and<00:01:51.420> sit<00:01:51.689> if<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:52.350> want<00:01:52.530> it's<00:01:52.770> higher<00:01:53.119> higher

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
and sit if you want it's higher higher

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.700 
and sit if you want it's higher higher
than<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.509> looks<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:54.840> it's<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.350> little<00:01:55.409> bit<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.649> an

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
than it looks so it's a little bit of an

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.719 
than it looks so it's a little bit of an
effort<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.950> get<00:01:56.070> up<00:01:56.130> there<00:01:56.219> but<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.399> figured<00:01:56.670> I

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
effort to get up there but I figured I

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.550 
effort to get up there but I figured I
could<00:01:56.880> practice<00:01:57.030> my<00:01:57.299> back<00:01:57.570> flips<00:01:57.840> my<00:01:58.229> front

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
could practice my back flips my front

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.560 
could practice my back flips my front
flips<00:01:58.799> my<00:01:58.950> gymnastics<00:01:59.159> over<00:01:59.790> this<00:01:59.909> all<00:02:00.119> my

flips my gymnastics over this all my

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.830 
flips my gymnastics over this all my
insane<00:02:01.079> flexibility<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.799> dream<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.250> um

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840
