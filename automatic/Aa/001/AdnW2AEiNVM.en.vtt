00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
to make the JPEGs a little bit soft so I

a mist from the other system cameras and
it's<00:02:32.030> great<00:02:32.330> for<00:02:32.540> taking<00:02:32.600> time<00:02:33.170> lapse

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470

thing<00:03:18.320> go<00:03:18.530> that's<00:03:18.710> what<00:03:18.890> I<00:03:18.920> tend<00:03:19.250> to<00:03:19.340> use<00:03:19.430> all

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
thing go that's what I tend to use all

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.550 
thing go that's what I tend to use all
the<00:03:19.970> time<00:03:20.150> anyway<00:03:20.510> so<00:03:20.690> I<00:03:20.870> can<00:03:21.080> be<00:03:21.170> sure<00:03:21.350> what

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
the time anyway so I can be sure what

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.280 
the time anyway so I can be sure what
I'm<00:03:21.680> focusing<00:03:22.160> on<00:03:22.330> face<00:03:23.330> priority<00:03:23.870> that<00:03:24.050> works

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
I'm focusing on face priority that works

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.020 
I'm focusing on face priority that works
really<00:03:24.560> well<00:03:24.710> and<00:03:25.130> because<00:03:25.640> I<00:03:25.760> use<00:03:25.880> this

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
really well and because I use this

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.970 
really well and because I use this
camera<00:03:26.210> mainly<00:03:26.720> for<00:03:26.870> family<00:03:27.230> stuff<00:03:27.470> I<00:03:27.620> tend<00:03:27.890> to

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
camera mainly for family stuff I tend to

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.050 
camera mainly for family stuff I tend to
leave<00:03:28.160> her<00:03:28.310> on<00:03:28.550> in<00:03:29.480> the<00:03:30.460> other<00:03:31.460> menu<00:03:31.700> you<00:03:31.970> can

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
leave her on in the other menu you can

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.630 
leave her on in the other menu you can
format<00:03:32.480> your<00:03:32.540> memory<00:03:32.930> card<00:03:33.400> welcome<00:03:34.400> screen

format your memory card welcome screen

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.160 
format your memory card welcome screen
and<00:03:34.880> leave<00:03:34.970> that<00:03:35.180> off<00:03:35.300> so<00:03:35.570> it<00:03:35.660> starts<00:03:36.020> up

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
and leave that off so it starts up

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.520 
and leave that off so it starts up
