and<00:00:13.950> I<00:00:14.400> never<00:00:15.150> actually<00:00:15.480> wore<00:00:16.109> red<00:00:16.500> lipstick

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
and I never actually wore red lipstick

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.340 
and I never actually wore red lipstick
before<00:00:17.279> I<00:00:17.550> met<00:00:17.789> her<00:00:17.940> maybe<00:00:18.240> once<00:00:18.480> or<00:00:18.690> twice<00:00:18.750> but

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
before I met her maybe once or twice but

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.900 
before I met her maybe once or twice but
then<00:00:19.500> when<00:00:19.980> I<00:00:20.039> was<00:00:20.130> hanging<00:00:20.369> out<00:00:20.430> with<00:00:20.580> her<00:00:20.699> and

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
then when I was hanging out with her and

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.970 
then when I was hanging out with her and
she<00:00:21.060> was<00:00:21.210> just<00:00:21.240> regularly<00:00:22.020> wearing<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:22.920> just

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
she was just regularly wearing it I just

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.189 
she was just regularly wearing it I just
thought<00:00:23.609> why<00:00:23.970> not<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.570> started<00:00:24.840> doing<00:00:24.990> it

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
thought why not and I started doing it

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.080 
thought why not and I started doing it
mostly<00:00:25.650> in<00:00:25.830> LA<00:00:26.039> though<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.609> guess<00:00:26.849> it's<00:00:27.060> just

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
mostly in LA though I guess it's just

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.519 
mostly in LA though I guess it's just
one<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.330> those<00:00:27.480> things<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:28.050> need<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.230> get

thought it would be I think it might

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
of a sheer lip balm so it doesn't look

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.719 
of a sheer lip balm so it doesn't look
as<00:01:18.600> pink<00:01:18.869> as<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.200> looks<00:01:19.409> in<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.860> tin<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.340> smell

as pink as it looks in the tin the smell

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.640 
as pink as it looks in the tin the smell
is<00:01:20.939> really<00:01:20.970> something<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:21.990> have<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.170> get<00:01:22.409> used

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
is really something you have to get used

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.880 
is really something you have to get used
to

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
to

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.469 
to
also<00:01:23.310> they<00:01:23.490> claim<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.299> like<00:01:24.450> a

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
also they claim that this is like a

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.630 
also they claim that this is like a
miracle<00:01:24.869> cream<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.650> even<00:01:26.159> though<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.549> a

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640

miracle cream and even though it is a
decent<00:01:27.240> lip<00:01:27.390> balm<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.869> don't<00:01:28.080> think<00:01:28.259> it's<00:01:28.409> that

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
decent lip balm I don't think it's that

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.680 
base I'll actually color my entire lips
with<00:04:28.830> a<00:04:28.860> pencil<00:04:29.370> and<00:04:29.610> then<00:04:29.820> use<00:04:30.060> this<00:04:30.270> one<00:04:30.480> and

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
with a pencil and then use this one and

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.270 
with a pencil and then use this one and
then<00:04:30.840> it<00:04:30.990> can<00:04:31.080> definitely<00:04:31.560> stay<00:04:31.800> on<00:04:31.950> for<00:04:32.220> a

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
then it can definitely stay on for a

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.800 
then it can definitely stay on for a
while<00:04:32.340> and<00:04:32.550> then<00:04:32.790> it's<00:04:32.940> also<00:04:33.060> really<00:04:33.450> easy<00:04:33.480> to

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
while and then it's also really easy to

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.030 
while and then it's also really easy to
reapply<00:04:34.110> because<00:04:34.290> they<00:04:34.440> don't<00:04:34.650> have<00:04:34.680> to<00:04:34.830> worry

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
reapply because they don't have to worry

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.010 
reapply because they don't have to worry
about<00:04:35.190> the<00:04:35.370> outer<00:04:35.520> line<00:04:35.820> so<00:04:36.060> much<00:04:36.240> above<00:04:36.840> this

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
about the outer line so much above this

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.200 
about the outer line so much above this
tiny<00:04:37.320> brush<00:04:37.560> that<00:04:37.920> I<00:04:37.980> used<00:04:38.400> to<00:04:38.820> apply

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
tiny brush that I used to apply

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.480 
tiny brush that I used to apply
concealer<00:04:39.840> but<00:04:40.320> I<00:04:40.560> actually<00:04:40.770> discovered<00:04:41.220> that

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
concealer but I actually discovered that

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.130 
concealer but I actually discovered that
this<00:04:41.610> one's<00:04:41.790> really<00:04:42.030> good<00:04:42.150> to<00:04:42.450> apply<00:04:42.720> lipstick

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
this one's really good to apply lipstick

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.660 
this one's really good to apply lipstick
and<00:04:43.290> it<00:04:43.380> makes<00:04:43.530> it<00:04:43.620> way<00:04:43.740> easier<00:04:43.770> to<00:04:44.160> work<00:04:44.520> on

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
and it makes it way easier to work on

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.580 
and it makes it way easier to work on
the<00:04:44.760> edges<00:04:45.120> of<00:04:45.270> your<00:04:45.300> lips<00:04:45.420> the<00:04:46.080> very<00:04:46.290> very

superstay<00:04:49.820> 24<00:04:50.820> I'm<00:04:51.330> assuming<00:04:51.750> they<00:04:51.840> mean

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
superstay 24 I'm assuming they mean

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.870 
superstay 24 I'm assuming they mean
24-hour<00:04:52.590> color<00:04:52.950> this<00:04:53.190> one<00:04:53.370> is<00:04:53.400> really

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
24-hour color this one is really

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.360 
24-hour color this one is really
interesting<00:04:54.300> because<00:04:54.420> on<00:04:54.870> one<00:04:55.200> side<00:04:55.590> it<00:04:55.920> has<00:04:55.950> a

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
interesting because on one side it has a

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.520 
interesting because on one side it has a
brush<00:04:56.760> with<00:04:57.120> kind<00:04:57.300> of<00:04:57.360> red<00:04:57.600> paint<00:04:58.050> this<00:04:58.350> is<00:04:58.500> a

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
brush with kind of red paint this is a

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.350 
brush with kind of red paint this is a
really<00:04:58.980> really<00:04:59.130> bright<00:04:59.490> red<00:04:59.670> by<00:04:59.850> the<00:04:59.880> way<00:05:00.030> so

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
really really bright red by the way so

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.970 
really really bright red by the way so
you<00:05:00.420> apply<00:05:00.690> that<00:05:00.900> one<00:05:01.110> and<00:05:01.380> you<00:05:01.500> like<00:05:01.680> to<00:05:01.770> try

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
you apply that one and you like to try

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.340 
you apply that one and you like to try
for<00:05:02.010> a<00:05:02.280> bit<00:05:02.400> and<00:05:02.640> you<00:05:03.000> apply<00:05:03.330> this<00:05:03.690> lip<00:05:04.080> balm

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
for a bit and you apply this lip balm

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.410 
for a bit and you apply this lip balm
that's<00:05:04.740> on<00:05:04.860> the<00:05:04.950> other<00:05:05.160> side<00:05:05.580> and<00:05:05.880> it<00:05:06.030> suddenly

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:06.420 
that's on the other side and it suddenly

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.900 
that's on the other side and it suddenly
looks<00:05:06.510> like<00:05:07.110> a<00:05:07.140> really<00:05:07.500> glossy<00:05:07.800> lipstick<00:05:08.580> now

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
looks like a really glossy lipstick now

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.130 
looks like a really glossy lipstick now
the<00:05:08.970> great<00:05:09.180> thing<00:05:09.360> about<00:05:09.390> this<00:05:09.720> is<00:05:09.900> that<00:05:09.930> it

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
the great thing about this is that it

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.500 
the great thing about this is that it
stays<00:05:10.410> on<00:05:10.440> forever<00:05:11.220> and<00:05:11.610> you<00:05:12.000> can<00:05:12.120> actually

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510
