 and to show a button our electrolux furnace 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.779
 When you buy in the oven the first thing you have to do is useless lifting the manual 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:27.999
 Instructions 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:32.059
 in this good manual there are two one that is a fast track that is easier to 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.870
 use stretched a little more complete they have recipes and many tricks are 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.079
 they can do things like schedule the time adjust the time the language is very 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.550
 important but also 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.880
 of functions manual we have some accessories such as the probe 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.760
 that we are going to cook with her 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.889
 sun fantastic instrument 

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:54.069
 we have trays several types a normal flat tray a tray 

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:57.879
 grids where the ied circulates and a tray a little deeper 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:00:58.760
 where 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.930
 fats are stored in Easter let see more 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.720
 we also have 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.120
 what it says here 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.470
 you want the steam function that steam function 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.730
 this oven 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.820
 is an oven that has all the functions to achieve the lowest 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.910
 and also that the extra function that is steam cooking with steam is very healthy 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.910
 because nutritionally we take advantage 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.729
 ea contributions that have the food we will see the menu pays is how easy 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.930
 what is the oven 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.580
 and then in the cooking functions 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.250
 we have for example wants hot what is the air of conviction the normal 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.130
 the next would be heat up and down without fan the next would be 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.300
 pitcher that is the fan with low resistance 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.030
 The next 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.050
 more conventional turbo which means fan with heat up 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.710
 then it would be a gray in carlos chairs just above the next would be 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.650
 double gray that means double the heat for very fast things 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.640
 then heat only lower 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.640
 the next one would be a fan but at a low temperature 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.960
 the next one would be 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.080
 the magical position what is heat with lying dor more 

00:02:11.679 --> 00:02:16.869
 steam and the next would be steam exclusively for cooking food and already 

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:20.729
 We would go back to see and warm up because their menu continually carries around the 

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:26.179
 goal came but really in what is different this oven is that it is a 

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:29.119
 oven with all the functions and besides that it did not work extra 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:30.910
 that does not work because it allows 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:31.669
 for example 

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:35.269
 work only on steam to cook food to cook seafood vegetables 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:39.969
 extraordinary meats besides cooking in steam and the function that is 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.150
 massa because it is a function that food 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.100
 they are cooked continuously 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.289
 with an added theme that prevents it from drying 

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:52.199
 What is really different is in the power of regeneration what is 

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:54.639
 reheat foods imagine that you 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:56.529
 lamb kitchen in advance 

00:02:56.529 --> 00:03:00.589
 because he does not have time and at the last minute he wants to warm up the heating is 

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:05.239
 heat and cook and the food are perfectly going to see also 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.699
 how the voice works the steam here have this to the tank what comes out 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.589
 and then or Xavier or not so you can see it well 

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:18.769
 we put the water down the water still boiler that is down here if it 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.939
 you can remove this to clean it off to provide weekly peace attack us 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:23.099
 simply 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:27.309
 for genovÃ©s we throw the water from the bag see how the same 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:33.289
 cadets and a liter of water and has a hard autonomy is to say 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:35.300
 half an hour 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.320
 to half an hour if the water runs out because clear evaporate water if it did not 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.449
 the oven separates typical this we would put it in simple stage flowers 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:46.629
 then without any special installation 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:48.549
 the oven is already 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.529
 but good what we have to do is see how it works let's see about 

00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:51.649
 examples
