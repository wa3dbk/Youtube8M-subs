farting<00:00:06.029> is<00:00:06.330> defined<00:00:06.779> as<00:00:06.960> an<00:00:07.080> expulsion

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
farting is defined as an expulsion

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.970 
farting is defined as an expulsion
through<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.309> rectum<00:00:08.690> of<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.929> mixture<00:00:10.290> of<00:00:10.410> gases

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
through the rectum of a mixture of gases

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.950 
through the rectum of a mixture of gases
that<00:00:11.010> are<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.309> byproduct<00:00:11.969> of<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.480> digestion

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
that are a byproduct of the digestion

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.099 
that are a byproduct of the digestion
process<00:00:13.650> so<00:00:14.219> I<00:00:14.519> suppose<00:00:15.330> my<00:00:15.360> question<00:00:15.570> today

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
process so I suppose my question today

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.760 
process so I suppose my question today
is<00:00:16.609> hurting<00:00:17.609> bad

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
is hurting bad

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.380 
is hurting bad
now<00:00:19.770> anecdotally<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.520> answer<00:00:20.789> may<00:00:20.910> depend<00:00:21.270> on

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
now anecdotally the answer may depend on

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.320 
now anecdotally the answer may depend on
your<00:00:21.570> gender<00:00:21.840> my<00:00:22.769> own<00:00:23.039> clinical<00:00:23.760> experience

your gender my own clinical experience
is<00:00:24.510> that<00:00:24.660> men<00:00:25.080> find<00:00:25.859> farting<00:00:26.400> funny<00:00:26.699> and

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
is that men find farting funny and

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.529 
is that men find farting funny and
acceptable<00:00:27.630> well<00:00:27.930> into<00:00:28.199> their<00:00:28.320> 80s<00:00:29.420> women<00:00:30.420> I

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
acceptable well into their 80s women I

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.120 
acceptable well into their 80s women I
think<00:00:30.570> stopped<00:00:31.199> finding<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.710> funny<00:00:31.890> and

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
think stopped finding it funny and

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.490 
think stopped finding it funny and
acceptable<00:00:32.640> at<00:00:32.790> about<00:00:33.120> age<00:00:33.989> seven<00:00:35.000> now<00:00:36.320> we<00:00:37.320> all

14 but there is a range for the

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.900 
14 but there is a range for the
aforementioned<00:00:46.200> reasons<00:00:46.680> women<00:00:47.489> tend<00:00:47.850> to

aforementioned reasons women tend to

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.400 
aforementioned reasons women tend to
hold<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.360> their<00:00:48.480> farts<00:00:48.780> which<00:00:49.050> can<00:00:49.260> have

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
hold in their farts which can have

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.350 
hold in their farts which can have
medical<00:00:49.829> consequences<00:00:50.520> such<00:00:50.700> as<00:00:50.730> bloating

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
medical consequences such as bloating

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.010 
medical consequences such as bloating
and<00:00:51.539> abdominal<00:00:51.930> pain<00:00:52.730> men<00:00:53.899> occasionally<00:00:54.899> do

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
and abdominal pain men occasionally do

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.310 
and abdominal pain men occasionally do
the<00:00:55.140> opposite<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.739> force<00:00:56.579> their<00:00:56.820> farts<00:00:57.320> which

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
the opposite and force their farts which

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.250 
the opposite and force their farts which
can<00:00:58.500> also<00:00:58.649> have<00:00:58.920> lots<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.250> quences<00:00:59.640> not<00:01:00.420> always

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
can also have lots of quences not always

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.509 
can also have lots of quences not always
medical<00:01:02.570> so<00:01:03.570> what<00:01:03.719> makes<00:01:03.930> us<00:01:04.110> fart<00:01:04.439> well<00:01:04.890> I'd

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
medical so what makes us fart well I'd

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.359 
medical so what makes us fart well I'd
say<00:01:05.790> three<00:01:06.210> major<00:01:06.450> reasons<00:01:06.920> firstly<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.130> air

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
say three major reasons firstly is air

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.840 
say three major reasons firstly is air
swallowing<00:01:09.060> what<00:01:09.390> we<00:01:09.540> call<00:01:09.810> arrow<00:01:10.110> Fei<00:01:10.650> Jia<00:01:10.950> so

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
swallowing what we call arrow Fei Jia so

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.390 
swallowing what we call arrow Fei Jia so
chewing<00:01:12.420> gum<00:01:12.600> eating<00:01:13.320> too<00:01:13.470> fast<00:01:13.500> drinking

chewing gum eating too fast drinking

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.820 
chewing gum eating too fast drinking
carbonated<00:01:14.640> beverages<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.659> smokers<00:01:16.619> who

carbonated beverages and smokers who

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.600 
carbonated beverages and smokers who
inhale<00:01:17.220> our<00:01:17.490> mortal<00:01:18.270> flatulent<00:01:18.930> secondly<00:01:19.830> is

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
inhale our mortal flatulent secondly is

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.609 
inhale our mortal flatulent secondly is
our<00:01:20.790> personal<00:01:21.150> composting<00:01:21.869> system<00:01:22.259> when<00:01:22.470> we

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
our personal composting system when we

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.890 
our personal composting system when we
things<00:01:22.979> like<00:01:23.189> beans<00:01:23.549> milk<00:01:24.090> sweet<00:01:24.420> potatoes

cauliflower

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
cauliflower

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.070 
cauliflower
they<00:01:26.280> all<00:01:26.430> contain<00:01:26.580> carbohydrates<00:01:27.210> which<00:01:27.869> can

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
they all contain carbohydrates which can

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.899 
they all contain carbohydrates which can
be<00:01:28.170> hard<00:01:28.439> for<00:01:28.650> our<00:01:28.770> enzymes<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.430> our<00:01:29.520> stomach

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
be hard for our enzymes in our stomach

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.240 
be hard for our enzymes in our stomach
to<00:01:30.000> break<00:01:30.119> down<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.689> these<00:01:31.470> become<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.829> magnet

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
to break down and these become a magnet

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.219 
to break down and these become a magnet
for<00:01:32.310> fermentation<00:01:33.150> in<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.299> large<00:01:33.570> intestine

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
for fermentation in the large intestine

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.700 
for fermentation in the large intestine
which<00:01:34.890> then<00:01:35.130> gives<00:01:35.340> off<00:01:35.520> gas<00:01:36.200> methane<00:01:37.200> has

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
which then gives off gas methane has

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.950 
which then gives off gas methane has
gotten<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.520> lot<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.119> flatulence<00:01:39.689> press

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
gotten a lot of the flatulence press

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.010 
gotten a lot of the flatulence press
because<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.530> whole<00:01:40.680> flammability<00:01:41.280> factor

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
because of the whole flammability factor

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.929 
because of the whole flammability factor
but<00:01:43.020> it's<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.350> sulphur<00:01:43.920> containing<00:01:44.250> foods<00:01:44.700> such

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
but it's a sulphur containing foods such

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.179 
but it's a sulphur containing foods such
as<00:01:44.970> meat<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.600> eggs<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:46.110> give<00:01:46.740> some<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.070> our

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
as meat and eggs that give some of our

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.030 
as meat and eggs that give some of our
flatus<00:01:47.579> as<00:01:47.700> unique<00:01:48.119> pungency<00:01:48.720> flatulence<00:01:49.710> can

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
flatus as unique pungency flatulence can

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.069 
flatus as unique pungency flatulence can
also<00:01:50.189> depend<00:01:50.640> on<00:01:50.729> your<00:01:50.909> own<00:01:51.060> unique<00:01:51.390> system<00:01:51.840> so

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
also depend on your own unique system so

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.929 
also depend on your own unique system so
for<00:01:52.259> example<00:01:52.740> if<00:01:52.890> you're<00:01:53.430> lactose<00:01:53.729> intolerant

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
for example if you're lactose intolerant

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.780 
for example if you're lactose intolerant
or<00:01:54.750> have<00:01:54.990> irritable<00:01:55.439> bowels<00:01:55.799> then<00:01:56.369> this<00:01:56.579> can

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
or have irritable bowels then this can

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.730 
or have irritable bowels then this can
lead<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.060> more<00:01:57.180> gas<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:58.170> if<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.320> want<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.500> limit

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
lead to more gas so if you want to limit

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.170 
lead to more gas so if you want to limit
your<00:01:58.829> flatus<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.369> can<00:01:59.490> think<00:01:59.700> about<00:01:59.790> your<00:02:00.000> air

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
your flatus you can think about your air

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.389 
your flatus you can think about your air
swallowing<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.990> can<00:02:01.140> walk<00:02:01.380> more<00:02:01.680> or<00:02:02.040> or<00:02:02.340> you

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
swallowing you can walk more or or you

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.969
