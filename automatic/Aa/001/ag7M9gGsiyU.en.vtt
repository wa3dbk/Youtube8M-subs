00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:04.670 

so<00:00:01.709> now<00:00:01.890> for<00:00:02.190> the<00:00:02.250> water<00:00:02.399> test<00:00:02.850> this<00:00:03.540> is<00:00:03.870> a<00:00:03.899> half

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
so now for the water test this is a half

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:13.209 
so now for the water test this is a half
a<00:00:05.009> cup<00:00:06.529> measuring<00:00:07.529> cup<00:00:09.620> and<00:00:10.620> we<00:00:10.740> are<00:00:10.830> going<00:00:11.040> to

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:13.219 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:24.920 

dump<00:00:14.219> this<00:00:19.400> let<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.430> soak<00:00:20.730> in<00:00:21.949> done<00:00:23.810> now<00:00:24.810> the

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
dump this let it soak in done now the

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:34.330 
dump this let it soak in done now the
other<00:00:25.140> side

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:50.360 

there<00:00:35.340> we<00:00:35.399> go<00:00:45.920> okay<00:00:47.360> so<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.899> can<00:00:49.079> see<00:00:49.370> both

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
there we go okay so you can see both

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.900 
there we go okay so you can see both
sides<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:52.190> amount<00:00:53.190> there<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.730> we<00:00:54.570> will<00:00:55.910> start

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
sides the amount there and we will start

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.760 
sides the amount there and we will start
the<00:00:57.120> vacuum<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.960> compare<00:00:58.890> each<00:00:59.280> one<00:01:00.770> first

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
the vacuum and compare each one first

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:49.450 
the vacuum and compare each one first
the<00:01:02.039> shot<00:01:02.280> back

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:03:01.490 

and<00:01:50.460> now<00:01:50.670> we'll<00:01:51.060> do<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.210> PF<00:01:51.600> 51

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.080 

yeah<00:03:02.500> I<00:03:02.530> didn't<00:03:02.860> time<00:03:03.099> it<00:03:03.129> but<00:03:03.489> I'm<00:03:03.879> hoping

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
yeah I didn't time it but I'm hoping

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.119 
yeah I didn't time it but I'm hoping
that's<00:03:04.480> roughly<00:03:05.050> the<00:03:05.230> same<00:03:05.410> amount<00:03:05.470> of<00:03:05.890> time

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129 
that's roughly the same amount of time

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:08.130 
that's roughly the same amount of time
and<00:03:06.459> then<00:03:06.910> we'll<00:03:07.180> blot<00:03:07.569> it<00:03:07.720> with<00:03:07.870> a<00:03:07.900> paper

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
and then we'll blot it with a paper

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.030 
and then we'll blot it with a paper
towel<00:03:08.500> and<00:03:08.530> see<00:03:09.129> what<00:03:09.250> difference<00:03:09.610> we<00:03:09.760> see<00:03:11.040> so

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
towel and see what difference we see so

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.119 
towel and see what difference we see so
I've<00:03:12.160> retrieved<00:03:12.610> a<00:03:13.060> paper<00:03:13.540> towel<00:03:13.870> to<00:03:14.650> try<00:03:15.069> to

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
I've retrieved a paper towel to try to

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.970 
I've retrieved a paper towel to try to
do<00:03:15.400> a<00:03:15.430> blot<00:03:15.700> test<00:03:16.030> each<00:03:16.569> side<00:03:16.959> has<00:03:17.349> two<00:03:17.680> Leafs

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
do a blot test each side has two Leafs

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.710 
do a blot test each side has two Leafs
we're<00:03:18.940> going<00:03:19.120> to<00:03:20.130> fold<00:03:21.130> it<00:03:21.310> up<00:03:21.430> here<00:03:21.940> in<00:03:22.150> in

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
we're going to fold it up here in in

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.680 
we're going to fold it up here in in
quarter<00:03:25.950> so<00:03:26.950> I<00:03:27.280> haven't<00:03:28.030> tried<00:03:28.269> this<00:03:28.480> before

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
quarter so I haven't tried this before

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:37.620 
quarter so I haven't tried this before
so<00:03:29.200> this<00:03:29.440> will<00:03:29.560> be<00:03:29.849> interesting<00:03:30.849> to<00:03:32.010> see<00:03:36.630> they

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
so this will be interesting to see they

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:46.589 
so this will be interesting to see they
both<00:03:37.810> feel<00:03:38.049> pretty<00:03:38.319> good

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:46.599 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:53.530 

well<00:03:48.370> see<00:03:49.370> that<00:03:49.549> looks<00:03:49.730> pretty<00:03:49.909> dry<00:03:52.540> the

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
well see that looks pretty dry the

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:59.830 
well see that looks pretty dry the
carpet<00:03:54.170> still<00:03:55.069> appears<00:03:55.909> wet<00:03:57.219> and<00:03:58.480> it<00:03:59.480> feels

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
carpet still appears wet and it feels

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.699 
carpet still appears wet and it feels
damp<00:04:00.260> I<00:04:01.390> was<00:04:02.390> hoping<00:04:02.720> the<00:04:02.900> paper<00:04:03.260> towel<00:04:03.470> would

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
damp I was hoping the paper towel would

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:11.630 
damp I was hoping the paper towel would
show<00:04:03.890> more

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.979 

yeah<00:04:12.640> unfortunately<00:04:13.360> No

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:23.020 

so<00:04:18.620> it<00:04:18.739> comes<00:04:18.979> down<00:04:19.190> to<00:04:19.900> subjectivity<00:04:21.789> it<00:04:22.789> is

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
so it comes down to subjectivity it is

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.730 
so it comes down to subjectivity it is
slightly<00:04:23.419> drier<00:04:23.870> oh<00:04:26.319> yeah<00:04:27.319> more<00:04:27.560> than

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
slightly drier oh yeah more than

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.070 
slightly drier oh yeah more than
slightly<00:04:27.949> I'd<00:04:28.789> say<00:04:29.030> it's<00:04:29.180> twice<00:04:29.449> as<00:04:29.479> dry<00:04:29.930> I

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
slightly I'd say it's twice as dry I

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.260 
slightly I'd say it's twice as dry I
guess<00:04:33.080> this<00:04:33.319> is<00:04:33.500> till<00:04:34.490> the<00:04:34.610> computers<00:04:35.060> got

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
guess this is till the computers got

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.680 
guess this is till the computers got
better<00:04:35.509> that<00:04:35.780> we<00:04:35.900> can<00:04:36.460> actually<00:04:37.460> communicate

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
better that we can actually communicate

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.100 
better that we can actually communicate
tactile<00:04:38.690> sense<00:04:39.430> sensory<00:04:40.660> perception<00:04:41.660> online

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
tactile sense sensory perception online

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.589 
tactile sense sensory perception online
you'll<00:04:42.620> have<00:04:42.800> to<00:04:42.889> take<00:04:43.009> my<00:04:43.220> word<00:04:43.370> for<00:04:43.400> it

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:44.599 
you'll have to take my word for it

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:47.740 
you'll have to take my word for it
but<00:04:45.470> the<00:04:45.590> bottom<00:04:45.919> line<00:04:45.949> is<00:04:46.460> I<00:04:46.669> think<00:04:46.940> it<00:04:47.449> did<00:04:47.720> a

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
but the bottom line is I think it did a

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.790 
but the bottom line is I think it did a
very<00:04:47.840> good<00:04:48.139> job<00:04:48.199> of<00:04:48.650> drawing<00:04:49.039> out<00:04:49.340> the<00:04:49.370> water

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
very good job of drawing out the water

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.779 
very good job of drawing out the water
obviously<00:04:51.800> there<00:04:51.979> they're<00:04:52.310> both<00:04:52.520> still

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:52.789 
obviously there they're both still

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:55.810 
obviously there they're both still

my only real beef with this unit as a

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:12.480 
my only real beef with this unit as a
detailer<00:05:08.509> is<00:05:08.810> the<00:05:09.620> only<00:05:10.419> to<00:05:11.419> me<00:05:11.630> useful
