00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.179
 Euro simple and yet so complicated 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:27.899
 the offside rule 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:33.960
 In the 140-page rules of FIFA gets the offside on Aigner Dina four page 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.290
 Place and relax 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.130
 if the West wants to put together even on a single sentence 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.610
 that would be too simplistic and probably too boring 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.530
 in the meantime even modern science has become for the 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.360
 Attempted offside rule 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.980
 a doctoral thesis on the subject exists as well as a shelf full of 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.260
 literature 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.190
 and when sports show the scribbled arrows and playing field 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.140
 Sketches to reach the mythical Möhlmann off to the side 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.140
 It's really that easy 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.040
 Markranstädt 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.420
 APA 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.910
 11,400 points 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.470
 this resulted in the midline worldwide 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.000
 In 2001, the city government forgot a very variable player world 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.090
 a long period of the 3 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.490
 there were 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.840
 between the weeping willows, Valentin is currently listed on the markets 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.350
 and thus that no opponent but its own server very heavy 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.890
 two players have the objection I want to be against YB today 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.310
 He who does the net of power »he could not have learned before the plan 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.960
 is the last time here 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.290
 alone NRW 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.290
 sold as Tyler Farrar 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.110
 Hagen 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.810
 Players can be opponents 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.340
 as say 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.550
 of understands 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.060
 and since there are no other fringe groups between administrations 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.290
 sprung 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.350
 Wales 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.080
 right, I know that now but again briefly together 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.120
 the offside rule prevents that on the seven players behind him defensive 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.300
 play or even near the door on long passes were 

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:13.219
 sounds logical or 

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:16.899
 But I also have it easy to talk I finally have FIFA better plan 

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:18.629
 I lie 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:23.290
 Now a little trip to the roots of football the people of the Maya 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.029
 the EM is probably still darkly known from history lessons 

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:30.449
 quasi the inspiration of today's football 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:34.899
 although the Maya were a powerful high culture in their heyday 

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:37.849
 she can not do that offside yet 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.500
 also no return round 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.750
 the winning team could celebrate while the losers got a head 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.289
 were made shorter 

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:48.169
 So we are happy that football is much more humane today 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:52.169
 Bloodstains aside and we are also happy that Germany 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:55.489
 Host of this year's football World Cup is 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.379
 after this little digression into the world of football with friendly 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.230
 Supporting the artists Kicker women really only remains 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.749
 determine 

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:05.269
 our girls are open
