dismissive and as you can see in the

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.870 
dismissive and as you can see in the
preview<00:02:41.810> very<00:02:42.410> quickly<00:02:42.709> a<00:02:43.070> man<00:02:43.550> that<00:02:43.580> looks

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.090 
preview very quickly a man that looks
like<00:02:43.970> an<00:02:44.120> unsullied<00:02:44.630> is<00:02:45.050> holding<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.680> sandy

like an unsullied is holding the sandy

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
hostage that's most likely Dario who is

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.380 
hostage that's most likely Dario who is
sneaking<00:02:48.920> his<00:02:49.160> way<00:02:49.190> in<00:02:49.520> in<00:02:49.700> order<00:02:49.910> to<00:02:50.060> talk<00:02:50.240> to

sneaking his way in in order to talk to
Danny<00:02:50.600> and<00:02:50.900> then<00:02:51.230> I'm<00:02:51.530> sure<00:02:51.800> Jorah<00:02:52.130> will<00:02:52.430> hate

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
Danny and then I'm sure Jorah will hate

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.850 
Danny and then I'm sure Jorah will hate
the<00:02:52.970> idea<00:02:53.150> just<00:02:53.540> like<00:02:53.840> in<00:02:53.990> the<00:02:54.020> books<00:02:54.320> but

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
the idea just like in the books but

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.470 
the idea just like in the books but
Danny<00:02:55.100> will<00:02:55.280> decide<00:02:55.640> to<00:02:55.790> give<00:02:56.030> dar<00:02:56.300> you<00:02:56.450> a

Danny will decide to give dar you a
chance<00:02:56.870> and<00:02:57.110> he'll<00:02:57.290> go<00:02:57.440> and<00:02:57.590> kill<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:58.040> other

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
chance and he'll go and kill the other

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.310 
chance and he'll go and kill the other
two<00:02:58.280> men<00:02:58.730> prend<00:02:59.180> on<00:02:59.360> Miro<00:02:59.720> to<00:02:59.900> show<00:03:00.200> his

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
two men prend on Miro to show his

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.710 
two men prend on Miro to show his
loyalty<00:03:00.800> and<00:03:00.980> swear<00:03:01.310> to<00:03:01.610> serve<00:03:02.000> Danny<00:03:02.360> I'm

loyalty and swear to serve Danny I'm

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.600 
loyalty and swear to serve Danny I'm
guessing<00:03:03.440> this<00:03:03.560> will<00:03:03.680> be<00:03:03.800> pretty<00:03:03.950> faithful<00:03:04.519> to

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
guessing this will be pretty faithful to

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.030 
guessing this will be pretty faithful to
the<00:03:04.730> books<00:03:04.970> I<00:03:05.209> just<00:03:05.690> know<00:03:05.900> that<00:03:06.140> Dario<00:03:06.530> has<00:03:06.800> to

complete all this in this episode

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.990 
complete all this in this episode
because<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:08.959> synopsis<00:03:09.530> for<00:03:09.590> episode<00:03:10.130> 9<00:03:10.370> has

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
because the synopsis for episode 9 has

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.180 
because the synopsis for episode 9 has
Dario<00:03:11.720> and<00:03:11.900> Jorah<00:03:12.140> debate<00:03:12.530> how<00:03:12.709> to<00:03:12.769> take<00:03:13.040> you

that in the preview I really look

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.600

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
forward to seeing them act together and

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.250 
forward to seeing them act together and
I<00:05:20.150> expect<00:05:20.540> them<00:05:20.660> to<00:05:20.750> spend<00:05:20.900> a<00:05:20.960> lot<00:05:21.140> of<00:05:21.170> time

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:23.420 
together of season 4 so that means we

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.820 
together of season 4 so that means we
probably<00:05:23.450> won't<00:05:23.930> be<00:05:24.050> seeing<00:05:24.380> Jamie<00:05:24.620> Lannister

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240 
see in the summaries I've read it looks

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.999 
see in the summaries I've read it looks
like<00:06:25.479> they<00:06:25.630> may<00:06:25.780> not<00:06:25.960> be<00:06:26.080> in<00:06:26.199> this<00:06:26.320> episode<00:06:26.650> at

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:27.009 
like they may not be in this episode at

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:29.070 
like they may not be in this episode at
all<00:06:27.550> and<00:06:27.850> if<00:06:27.940> they<00:06:28.060> are<00:06:28.210> it'll<00:06:28.630> probably<00:06:28.900> be

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
all and if they are it'll probably be

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.320 
all and if they are it'll probably be
super<00:06:29.560> breathe<00:06:29.770> I<00:06:30.039> think<00:06:30.550> this<00:06:30.639> is<00:06:30.699> a<00:06:30.820> serious

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.330 
super breathe I think this is a serious

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.330 
super breathe I think this is a serious
issue<00:06:31.509> that's<00:06:31.990> true<00:06:32.320> and<00:06:32.470> to<00:06:32.590> make<00:06:32.740> up<00:06:32.949> for<00:06:33.220> it

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.340 
issue that's true and to make up for it

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.189 
issue that's true and to make up for it
they'll<00:06:33.520> really<00:06:33.759> need<00:06:33.970> to<00:06:34.060> dedicate<00:06:34.210> a<00:06:34.449> lot<00:06:34.960> of

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:35.199 
they'll really need to dedicate a lot of

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:37.260 
they'll really need to dedicate a lot of
time<00:06:35.410> to<00:06:35.590> them<00:06:35.740> in<00:06:35.860> episode<00:06:36.220> 9<00:06:36.250> they<00:06:37.090> just

and showrunners of game of thrones were

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.430 
and showrunners of game of thrones were
inspired<00:06:45.820> to<00:06:45.970> make<00:06:46.120> this<00:06:46.479> show<00:06:46.750> based<00:06:47.139> on<00:06:47.350> the

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 
inspired to make this show based on the

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.379 
inspired to make this show based on the
red<00:06:47.620> wedding<00:06:47.800> scene<00:06:48.190> so<00:06:48.789> even<00:06:49.150> though<00:06:49.180> I'm

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:49.389 
red wedding scene so even though I'm

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:50.879 
red wedding scene so even though I'm
really<00:06:49.690> concerned<00:06:49.990> about<00:06:50.139> the<00:06:50.320> lack<00:06:50.500> of<00:06:50.560> time

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:50.889 
really concerned about the lack of time

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:53.250 
really concerned about the lack of time
given<00:06:51.340> to<00:06:51.460> rob<00:06:51.639> and<00:06:51.850> cat<00:06:52.060> I<00:06:52.300> still<00:06:52.750> think<00:06:53.110> they

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:53.260 
given to rob and cat I still think they

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.890 
given to rob and cat I still think they
can<00:06:53.500> to<00:06:53.800> a<00:06:53.830> degree<00:06:54.039> redeem<00:06:54.699> themselves<00:06:55.180> do<00:06:55.750> the

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:55.900 
can to a degree redeem themselves do the

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.140 
can to a degree redeem themselves do the
red<00:06:56.050> wedding<00:06:56.260> justice<00:06:56.830> and<00:06:57.039> I<00:06:57.190> hope<00:06:57.610> really

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:58.150 
red wedding justice and I hope really

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.820 
red wedding justice and I hope really
hope<00:06:58.510> I'm<00:06:58.720> wrong<00:06:58.960> about<00:06:59.260> my<00:06:59.380> prediction<00:06:59.800> that

00:06:59.820 --> 00:06:59.830 
hope I'm wrong about my prediction that

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:01.230 
hope I'm wrong about my prediction that
they'll<00:07:00.039> get<00:07:00.160> very<00:07:00.400> little<00:07:00.580> to<00:07:00.789> no<00:07:00.910> screen

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:01.240 
they'll get very little to no screen

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.240 
they'll get very little to no screen
time<00:07:01.330> and<00:07:01.599> episode<00:07:01.960> 8<00:07:02.169> but<00:07:02.680> it<00:07:02.800> really<00:07:03.039> looks

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:03.250 
time and episode 8 but it really looks

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:06.060 
time and episode 8 but it really looks
that<00:07:03.460> way<00:07:03.610> if<00:07:04.330> they<00:07:04.660> do<00:07:04.720> though<00:07:05.139> I<00:07:05.169> want<00:07:05.949> to

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:06.070 
that way if they do though I want to

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:07.980 
that way if they do though I want to
hear<00:07:06.280> about<00:07:06.400> Jon<00:07:06.759> Snow<00:07:07.030> being<00:07:07.240> legitimize<00:07:07.690> it
