in<00:00:31.019> there<00:00:32.540> this<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:36.020> the<00:00:37.020> superior<00:00:37.440> vena<00:00:37.649> cava

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
in there this is the superior vena cava

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.229 
in there this is the superior vena cava
and<00:00:39.920> down<00:00:40.920> here<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:42.030> inferior<00:00:42.989> vena<00:00:43.020> cava

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
and this is the left pulmonary vein and

00:00:50.969 --> 00:01:01.639 
and this is the left pulmonary vein and
right<00:00:51.359> pulmonary<00:00:51.660> veins<00:00:58.399> and<00:01:00.230> this<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.469> the

everything<00:01:08.220> right<00:01:08.820> atrium<00:01:09.390> right<00:01:10.080> here<00:01:10.470> and

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:20.720 

in<00:01:14.010> here<00:01:14.970> would<00:01:15.180> be<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:18.830> tricuspid<00:01:19.830> valve<00:01:20.370> and

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:20.730 
in here would be the tricuspid valve and

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.870 
in here would be the tricuspid valve and
this<00:01:21.660> would<00:01:21.810> be<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.170> right<00:01:22.380> ventricle<00:01:23.250> in

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
this would be the right ventricle in

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.430 
this would be the right ventricle in
here<00:01:24.180> this<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.260> the<00:01:25.410> left<00:01:25.970> ventricle<00:01:27.230> with<00:01:28.230> the

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
here this is the left ventricle with the

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.940 
here this is the left ventricle with the
bicuspid<00:01:29.250> valve<00:01:29.700> right<00:01:30.270> here<00:01:30.680> this<00:01:31.680> is<00:01:31.740> the

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
bicuspid valve right here this is the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.030 
bicuspid valve right here this is the
left<00:01:32.930> atrium<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:36.080> right<00:01:37.080> at<00:01:37.230> the<00:01:37.260> base<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.530> the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
left atrium and right at the base of the

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.760 
left atrium and right at the base of the
aorta<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:40.040> aortic<00:01:41.040> semilunar<00:01:41.280> valve<00:01:41.760> and

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
aorta is the aortic semilunar valve and

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.580 
aorta is the aortic semilunar valve and
deep<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:44.040> here<00:01:44.370> would<00:01:44.640> be<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:45.590> pulmonary

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
deep in here would be the pulmonary

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.320 
deep in here would be the pulmonary
semilunar<00:01:46.979> valve<00:01:47.460> at<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.729> base<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.000> the

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
semilunar valve at the base of the

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:56.900 
semilunar valve at the base of the
pulmonary<00:01:48.750> trunk<00:01:49.940> the<00:01:55.340> this<00:01:56.340> would<00:01:56.520> be<00:01:56.670> the

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
pulmonary trunk the this would be the

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.859 
pulmonary trunk the this would be the
trabeculae<00:01:57.869> karne<00:01:58.350> in<00:01:58.740> here<00:01:59.190> the<00:01:59.869> lattice

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
trabeculae karne in here the lattice

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:07.190 
trabeculae karne in here the lattice
like<00:02:01.590> matter<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:06.180> tech<00:02:06.510> tonight<00:02:06.720> muscle

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
like matter and the tech tonight muscle

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.820 
like matter and the tech tonight muscle
it<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.560> right<00:02:08.340> here<00:02:08.670> bottom<00:02:09.240> smooth<00:02:10.229> part<00:02:10.560> and

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
it is right here bottom smooth part and

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.340 
it is right here bottom smooth part and
the<00:02:11.490> branched<00:02:12.360> part<00:02:12.660> is<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:15.350> chordae

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
the branched part is the chordae

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.560 
the branched part is the chordae
tendineae<00:02:17.180> right<00:02:18.180> there<00:02:18.860> so<00:02:19.860> anything<00:02:20.130> else

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
tendineae right there so anything else

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.000 
tendineae right there so anything else
did<00:02:21.570> you<00:02:21.690> get<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.959> interventricular<00:02:22.530> septum

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
did you get the interventricular septum

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.000 
did you get the interventricular septum
and<00:02:23.610> oh<00:02:24.209> yeah<00:02:24.570> this<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.230> interventricular

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
and oh yeah this is the interventricular

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.250 
and oh yeah this is the interventricular
septum

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
septum

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.339 
septum
this<00:02:28.860> is<00:02:29.040> Milo<00:02:29.310> cardium<00:02:29.849> the<00:02:30.750> apex<00:02:31.140> of<00:02:31.290> the

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
this is Milo cardium the apex of the

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:39.550 
this is Milo cardium the apex of the
heart<00:02:31.439> rate<00:02:32.129> is<00:02:32.370> right<00:02:32.549> here<00:02:32.909> a<00:02:36.409> little<00:02:37.409> muscle

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
heart rate is right here a little muscle

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:53.659 
heart rate is right here a little muscle
yep<00:02:41.360> think<00:02:42.360> that's<00:02:42.629> it<00:02:50.299> good<00:02:51.299> job<00:02:51.420> you<00:02:51.480> guys
