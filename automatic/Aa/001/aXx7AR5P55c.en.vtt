in<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:09.580> previous<00:00:09.970> videos<00:00:10.390> we've<00:00:10.660> seen<00:00:10.690> how

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.080 
in the previous videos we've seen how

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.770 
in the previous videos we've seen how
enabling<00:00:11.770> control<00:00:12.220> pain

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
enabling control pain

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.140 
enabling control pain
can<00:00:13.260> really<00:00:13.560> help<00:00:13.830> us<00:00:13.980> control<00:00:14.460> where<00:00:14.790> we<00:00:14.970> lay

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
can really help us control where we lay

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.120 
can really help us control where we lay
down<00:00:15.180> seams<00:00:15.780> along<00:00:16.110> our<00:00:16.260> model<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:16.770> even

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
down seams along our model and even

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.120 
down seams along our model and even
control<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.790> density<00:00:18.300> of<00:00:18.420> our<00:00:18.540> UV<00:00:18.900> space<00:00:19.230> what

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
control the density of our UV space what

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.530 
control the density of our UV space what
I'd<00:00:20.250> like<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.520> talk<00:00:20.730> about<00:00:20.880> quickly<00:00:21.360> in<00:00:21.450> this

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:21.540 
I'd like to talk about quickly in this

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
enable control painting now you'll

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.080 
enable control painting now you'll
notice<00:00:30.210> if<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.480> press<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.779> protect<00:00:31.529> button<00:00:32.090> all

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.060 
notice if I press the protect button all
that<00:00:33.660> painting<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.230> did<00:00:34.320> in<00:00:34.559> this<00:00:34.800> session

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
that painting that I did in this session

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.850 
that painting that I did in this session
is<00:00:35.420> still<00:00:36.420> saved<00:00:36.720> to<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.960> model<00:00:37.320> but<00:00:37.650> if<00:00:37.769> I

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
is still saved to the model but if I

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.530 
is still saved to the model but if I
want<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.129> permanently<00:00:38.340> save<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.120> out<00:00:39.300> so

protect and turn that off I have an able

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.360 
protect and turn that off I have an able
control<00:00:45.570> painting<00:00:46.050> set<00:00:46.290> and<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:47.040> see<00:00:47.219> down

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
control painting set and you see down

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.760 
control painting set and you see down
here<00:00:47.430> at<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.910> bottom<00:00:48.059> we<00:00:48.450> have<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.930> save

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
here at the bottom we have a save

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.310 
here at the bottom we have a save
control<00:00:50.520> map<00:00:50.940> I'm<00:00:51.480> gonna<00:00:51.629> click<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:51.960> button

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
control map I'm gonna click that button

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.350 
control map I'm gonna click that button
right<00:00:52.500> there<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:53.040> this<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:53.850> going<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.059> save

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
right there and this is going to save

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.479 
right there and this is going to save
all<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.809> control<00:00:55.200> data<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.860> we<00:00:55.950> have<00:00:56.160> set<00:00:56.460> to

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
all the control data that we have set to

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.920 
all the control data that we have set to
our<00:00:56.730> model<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:59.030> recommend<00:01:00.030> saving<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.660> map

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
our model I recommend saving that map

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.359 
our model I recommend saving that map
with<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.469> actual<00:01:01.829> ztl<00:01:03.470> so<00:01:04.470> for<00:01:04.710> instance<00:01:05.009> if<00:01:05.190> I

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
with the actual ztl so for instance if I

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.639 
with the actual ztl so for instance if I
click<00:01:05.580> enable<00:01:06.300> control<00:01:06.630> painting<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.440> click

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:07.649 
click enable control painting and click

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:09.499 
click enable control painting and click
density<00:01:08.160> you<00:01:08.520> can<00:01:08.580> see<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.000> also<00:01:09.240> had<00:01:09.479> a

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
density you can see that I also had a

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:11.389 
density you can see that I also had a
density<00:01:10.110> map<00:01:10.259> painted<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.770> this<00:01:10.890> model<00:01:11.250> that

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:11.399 
density map painted to this model that

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:14.330 
density map painted to this model that
was<00:01:11.520> saved<00:01:11.729> out<00:01:11.940> as<00:01:12.090> well<00:01:12.740> so<00:01:13.740> if<00:01:13.800> I<00:01:13.890> needed<00:01:14.250> to

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
was saved out as well so if I needed to

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.810 
was saved out as well so if I needed to
load<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:14.789> a<00:01:15.030> specific<00:01:15.530> density<00:01:16.530> or<00:01:16.820> protective

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
load in a specific density or protective

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.350 
load in a specific density or protective
attractive<00:01:18.360> seam<00:01:18.689> map<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:19.200> could<00:01:19.650> simply<00:01:22.340> click

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
attractive seam map I could simply click

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.660 
attractive seam map I could simply click
load<00:01:24.360> control<00:01:24.869> map<00:01:25.049> down<00:01:25.380> here<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.830> that'll

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
load control map down here and that'll

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.670 
load control map down here and that'll
load<00:01:26.880> in<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.210> control<00:01:27.600> map<00:01:30.259> you<00:01:31.259> also<00:01:31.409> see

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
load in the control map you also see

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.310 
load in the control map you also see
this<00:01:31.830> option<00:01:32.250> here<00:01:32.400> which<00:01:32.580> is<00:01:32.729> clear<00:01:33.000> map<00:01:33.320> so

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
this option here which is clear map so

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.910 
this option here which is clear map so
if<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.590> press<00:01:35.220> clear<00:01:35.670> map<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.470> then<00:01:37.470> turn<00:01:37.799> on

if I press clear map and then turn on
protective<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.840> notice<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.170> red<00:01:40.470> and

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
protective you notice that that red and

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.010 
protective you notice that that red and
blue<00:01:41.009> region<00:01:41.700> has<00:01:42.119> now<00:01:42.299> been<00:01:42.509> removed<00:01:42.869> from
