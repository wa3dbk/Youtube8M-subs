compared<00:02:45.549> to<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.930> blue<00:02:47.110> teos<00:02:47.379> Wow<00:02:48.280> they<00:02:49.239> are

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.960 
compared to the blue teos Wow they are
lightweight<00:02:49.660> but<00:02:50.370> let's<00:02:51.370> take<00:02:51.519> a<00:02:51.549> walk<00:02:51.790> around

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
lightweight but let's take a walk around

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.910

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
the right side it's got like this carbon

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.080 
the right side it's got like this carbon
fiber<00:02:58.989> I<00:02:59.560> really<00:03:00.040> like<00:03:00.340> how<00:03:00.640> they<00:03:00.790> did<00:03:00.849> their

forwards track and I really like that
there's<00:04:09.250> a<00:04:09.400> blue<00:04:09.549> teal<00:04:09.700> doesn't<00:04:10.150> have<00:04:10.330> that

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
there's a blue teal doesn't have that

yeah see what it has it right here but

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:14.490 
yeah see what it has it right here but
it's<00:04:12.250> a<00:04:12.280> little<00:04:12.459> bit<00:04:12.810> more<00:04:13.810> difficult<00:04:14.260> to<00:04:14.319> work

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
it's a little bit more difficult to work

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.590 
it's a little bit more difficult to work
it's<00:04:14.769> better<00:04:14.920> just<00:04:15.010> to<00:04:15.220> press<00:04:15.549> a<00:04:15.579> button<00:04:15.909> which

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
it's better just to press a button which

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.719 
it's better just to press a button which
is<00:04:16.720> what<00:04:16.870> I<00:04:16.900> prefer<00:04:16.959> here<00:04:17.530> and<00:04:18.310> this<00:04:18.489> is<00:04:18.579> like<00:04:18.699> a

this<00:05:21.430> video<00:05:21.669> to<00:05:21.789> bash<00:05:22.000> the<00:05:22.210> video<00:05:22.479> but<00:05:23.020> the

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
this video to bash the video but the

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.779 
this video to bash the video but the
blue<00:05:23.229> do<00:05:23.380> is<00:05:23.560> a<00:05:23.590> very<00:05:23.860> powerful<00:05:24.070> headset<00:05:24.669> and<00:05:24.729> I

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:24.789 
blue do is a very powerful headset and I

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:26.850 
blue do is a very powerful headset and I
use<00:05:24.940> this<00:05:25.090> daily<00:05:25.330> and<00:05:25.720> so<00:05:26.110> maybe<00:05:26.500> this<00:05:26.680> can

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
use this daily and so maybe this can

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.750 
use this daily and so maybe this can
replace<00:05:27.190> it<00:05:27.400> I<00:05:27.550> don't<00:05:27.940> know<00:05:28.289> but<00:05:29.490> design<00:05:30.490> wise

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
replace it I don't know but design wise

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.230 
replace it I don't know but design wise
you<00:05:31.539> can<00:05:31.570> see<00:05:31.900> it's<00:05:32.590> a<00:05:32.800> lot<00:05:33.099> smaller<00:05:33.610> than<00:05:34.090> the

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
you can see it's a lot smaller than the

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.200 
you can see it's a lot smaller than the
blue<00:05:34.360> tio<00:05:34.510> but<00:05:34.750> it<00:05:34.840> feels<00:05:35.050> more<00:05:35.260> premium

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
blue tio but it feels more premium

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.339 
blue tio but it feels more premium
definitely<00:05:37.210> feels<00:05:37.450> more<00:05:37.539> premium<00:05:37.810> around

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:38.349 
definitely feels more premium around

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:42.450 
definitely feels more premium around
here<00:05:38.770> because<00:05:40.770> the<00:05:41.770> build<00:05:41.949> quality<00:05:42.039> is<00:05:42.280> better

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
here because the build quality is better

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.490 
here because the build quality is better
it's<00:05:43.120> got<00:05:43.270> metal<00:05:43.510> in<00:05:43.720> there<00:05:43.900> that's<00:05:44.139> actually

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
it's got metal in there that's actually

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.050 
it's got metal in there that's actually
metal<00:05:44.710> so<00:05:45.520> I<00:05:45.550> don't<00:05:45.699> have<00:05:45.760> to<00:05:45.849> worry<00:05:45.970> about

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
metal so I don't have to worry about

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.409 
metal so I don't have to worry about
that<00:05:46.300> breaking<00:05:46.949> this<00:05:47.949> part<00:05:48.220> right<00:05:48.340> here<00:05:48.419> seems

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419 
that breaking this part right here seems

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:50.790 
that breaking this part right here seems
like<00:05:49.539> it'll<00:05:49.690> do<00:05:49.840> better<00:05:50.050> on<00:05:50.139> your<00:05:50.260> ear<00:05:50.560> I'll

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
like it'll do better on your ear I'll

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.189 
like it'll do better on your ear I'll
try<00:05:51.070> it<00:05:51.130> on<00:05:51.250> here<00:05:51.460> in<00:05:51.520> a<00:05:51.550> minute<00:05:51.820> that<00:05:52.810> controls

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199 
try it on here in a minute that controls

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:56.070 
try it on here in a minute that controls
this<00:05:54.130> part<00:05:54.430> is<00:05:54.520> softer<00:05:55.000> then<00:05:55.630> on<00:05:55.750> the<00:05:55.840> booty

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
this part is softer then on the booty

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.230 
this part is softer then on the booty
out<00:05:56.110> I<00:05:56.440> actually<00:05:57.400> think<00:05:57.640> this<00:05:57.789> is<00:05:57.849> probably

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240
