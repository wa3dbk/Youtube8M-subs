of<00:00:32.399> memory<00:00:32.790> i<00:00:33.410> decided<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.440> i<00:00:34.620> wanted<00:00:35.040> to

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
of memory i decided that i wanted to

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.450 
of memory i decided that i wanted to
keep<00:00:35.309> this<00:00:35.520> one<00:00:35.730> small<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.899> um<00:00:37.230> anyway<00:00:38.190> let's

about that um yeah so to input your

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.380 
about that um yeah so to input your
model<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.739> got<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.039> make<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.820> out<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.059> glass

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
model you got to make it out of glass

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.170 
model you got to make it out of glass
and<00:00:54.449> lapis<00:00:55.190> class<00:00:56.190> bean<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.789> see-through

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
and lapis class bean the see-through

blocks left has been the blocks you

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.520 
blocks left has been the blocks you
actually<00:01:00.210> see<00:01:01.219> i<00:01:02.219> use<00:01:02.760> trays<00:01:03.719> lenders<00:01:04.110> spawn

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
ha's technique where you spawn blocks

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.850 
ha's technique where you spawn blocks
and<00:01:07.500> wherever<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.640> like<00:01:08.820> as<00:01:09.630> falling<00:01:10.619> sand

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
and wherever you like as falling sand

entities<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:12.240> only<00:01:12.450> problem<00:01:12.659> with<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.049> is

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
entities the only problem with this is

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.440 
entities the only problem with this is
there's<00:01:16.170> no<00:01:16.350> blocks<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:17.009> can<00:01:17.159> drop<00:01:17.970> which

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
there's no blocks you can drop which

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.710 
there's no blocks you can drop which
seeker<00:01:19.229> or<00:01:19.460> there<00:01:20.460> might<00:01:20.549> be<00:01:20.610> just<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.659> don't

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
seeker or there might be just I don't

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.830 
seeker or there might be just I don't
know<00:01:21.990> about<00:01:22.110> them<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:23.310> um<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.030> have<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.659> stick

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
know about them so um I have to stick

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.980 
know about them so um I have to stick
with<00:01:24.869> glass<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:28.880> let's<00:01:29.880> just<00:01:30.090> gonna<00:01:30.570> shut<00:01:30.840> this

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
with glass so let's just gonna shut this

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.789 
with glass so let's just gonna shut this
model<00:01:32.479> make<00:01:33.479> sure<00:01:33.659> wait<00:01:33.780> what<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:33.960> do<00:01:34.110> here<00:01:34.470> I

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
don't do that 1i I'm just gonna make a

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:49.300 
don't do that 1i I'm just gonna make a
kind<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.780> hollow<00:01:40.110> cube<00:01:40.710> in<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.189> way<00:01:46.790> last<00:01:47.790> one

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
kind of hollow cube in a way last one

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:56.240 
kind of hollow cube in a way last one
square<00:01:51.590> and<00:01:53.390> that<00:01:54.390> now<00:01:55.020> notice<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.710> in<00:01:55.890> stone

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
square and that now notice the in stone

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.590 
square and that now notice the in stone
there<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:57.090> means<00:01:57.329> end<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.869> line<00:01:58.130> you<00:01:59.130> can

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
there that means end of line you can

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.840 
there that means end of line you can
possibly<00:02:00.600> guess<00:02:01.079> what<00:02:01.229> i<00:02:01.320> mean<00:02:01.500> but<00:02:02.340> i'll<00:02:02.579> set

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
possibly guess what i mean but i'll set

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.850 
possibly guess what i mean but i'll set
anyway<00:02:03.210> so<00:02:03.270> what<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:04.049> means<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:04.909> once<00:02:06.860> this

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
anyway so what that means is once this

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.240 
anyway so what that means is once this
chest<00:02:08.190> is<00:02:08.369> emptied<00:02:08.789> up<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:10.289> in<00:02:10.440> stone<00:02:10.770> the

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
chest is emptied up to the in stone the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.050 
chest is emptied up to the in stone the
in<00:02:11.340> stone<00:02:11.580> will<00:02:11.940> trigger<00:02:12.270> the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
in stone will trigger the

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.620 
in stone will trigger the
hoped<00:02:13.720> and<00:02:14.640> part<00:02:15.640> of<00:02:15.790> it<00:02:15.970> which<00:02:16.209> will<00:02:16.390> just

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
hoped and part of it which will just

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.110 
hoped and part of it which will just
cease<00:02:16.900> all<00:02:17.230> printing<00:02:17.770> and<00:02:18.480> yeah<00:02:19.480> so<00:02:19.780> just<00:02:20.140> stop

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
cease all printing and yeah so just stop

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.530 
cease all printing and yeah so just stop
now<00:02:22.440> without<00:02:23.440> further<00:02:23.500> ado<00:02:24.010> let's<00:02:24.340> print<00:02:24.580> this

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.600 

so<00:02:28.540> look<00:02:29.080> up<00:02:29.230> there<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.920> blocks<00:02:30.160> will<00:02:30.370> drop

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
so look up there the blocks will drop

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.759 
so look up there the blocks will drop
out<00:02:30.730> of<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:31.030> sky<00:02:31.300> and<00:02:31.690> to<00:02:32.319> our<00:02:32.440> kind<00:02:32.650> of

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
out of the sky and to our kind of

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.979 
out of the sky and to our kind of
printing<00:02:33.280> area<00:02:35.489> i<00:02:36.720> could<00:02:37.720> probably<00:02:37.870> actually

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
printing area i could probably actually

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.839 
printing area i could probably actually
speed<00:02:38.470> up<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.739> printing<00:02:39.099> but<00:02:39.510> it's<00:02:41.849> this

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
speed up the printing but it's this

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.449 
speed up the printing but it's this
thing<00:02:43.000> is<00:02:43.150> quite<00:02:43.540> finicky<00:02:43.900> in<00:02:44.200> a<00:02:44.260> way<00:02:44.380> if<00:02:45.130> you

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
thing is quite finicky in a way if you

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.820 
thing is quite finicky in a way if you
change<00:02:46.239> one<00:02:48.060> one<00:02:49.060> repeater<00:02:49.390> and<00:02:49.750> it<00:02:50.470> you

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
change one one repeater and it you

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.830 
change one one repeater and it you
there's<00:02:51.280> a<00:02:51.340> very<00:02:51.580> high<00:02:51.670> chance<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:52.209> destroy

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
there's a very high chance to destroy

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.380 
there's a very high chance to destroy
half<00:02:53.260> of<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.860> hex<00:02:54.069> your<00:02:54.340> printing<00:02:54.760> mechanism

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
half of the hex your printing mechanism

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.190 
half of the hex your printing mechanism
which<00:02:56.019> I'll<00:02:56.200> shop<00:02:57.010> later<00:02:57.489> in<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:57.760> video<00:02:58.200> now

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
which I'll shop later in the video now

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.320 
which I'll shop later in the video now
there's<00:02:59.380> also<00:02:59.530> some<00:02:59.830> other<00:02:59.890> funky<00:03:00.310> parts<00:03:00.670> as

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
there's also some other funky parts as

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.809 
there's also some other funky parts as
you<00:03:01.450> can<00:03:01.569> see<00:03:01.840> there<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:02.830> two<00:03:03.069> lapis<00:03:03.519> blocks

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
you can see there the two lapis blocks

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:05.820 
you can see there the two lapis blocks
fell<00:03:04.150> before<00:03:04.420> everything<00:03:04.810> else<00:03:05.049> not<00:03:05.500> too<00:03:05.650> sure

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
fell before everything else not too sure

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.690 
fell before everything else not too sure
why<00:03:06.510> let's<00:03:07.510> yeah<00:03:08.019> is<00:03:08.319> issues<00:03:08.890> for<00:03:09.130> these<00:03:09.340> kinds

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
why let's yeah is issues for these kinds

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.940 
why let's yeah is issues for these kinds
of<00:03:09.730> things<00:03:10.349> anyway<00:03:11.349> almost<00:03:11.920> finished<00:03:13.769> so<00:03:14.769> much

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
a nice of my old printer i can say that

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:23.520 
a nice of my old printer i can say that

complete sir there we go got a printed
object<00:03:28.810> now<00:03:29.590> i'm<00:03:29.650> going<00:03:29.799> to<00:03:29.890> jump<00:03:30.040> into<00:03:30.280> a

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
object now i'm going to jump into a

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.039 
object now i'm going to jump into a
world<00:03:31.030> with<00:03:31.630> no<00:03:32.280> courts<00:03:33.280> everywhere<00:03:34.120> and<00:03:34.329> show

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
world with no courts everywhere and show

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.030 
world with no courts everywhere and show
you<00:03:35.109> why<00:03:35.290> actually<00:03:35.680> looks<00:03:35.829> like<00:03:37.109> um<00:03:38.109> so<00:03:38.890> here's

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
you why actually looks like um so here's

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.819 
you why actually looks like um so here's
the<00:03:39.280> insides<00:03:39.579> it's<00:03:40.299> actually<00:03:40.690> tiny<00:03:41.290> compared

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
the insides it's actually tiny compared

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:44.729 
the insides it's actually tiny compared
to<00:03:41.920> the<00:03:42.010> old<00:03:42.130> printer<00:03:42.549> and<00:03:43.350> consists<00:03:44.350> of<00:03:44.440> three

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
to the old printer and consists of three

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.280 
to the old printer and consists of three
major<00:03:44.950> components<00:03:45.160> one<00:03:45.940> the<00:03:46.359> reading<00:03:46.870> device

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
major components one the reading device

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.750 
major components one the reading device
and<00:03:48.900> what<00:03:49.900> this<00:03:50.019> does<00:03:50.079> is<00:03:50.470> it<00:03:50.859> filters<00:03:51.670> out

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
and what this does is it filters out

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.690 
and what this does is it filters out
items<00:03:52.180> coming<00:03:52.450> from<00:03:52.660> the<00:03:52.780> chest<00:03:53.079> and<00:03:53.700> detects

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
items coming from the chest and detects

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.020 
items coming from the chest and detects
whether<00:03:55.170> or<00:03:56.170> not<00:03:56.350> to<00:03:56.590> send<00:03:56.829> a<00:03:56.889> pulse<00:03:57.069> to<00:03:57.880> the

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
whether or not to send a pulse to the

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.970 
whether or not to send a pulse to the
specific<00:03:58.600> printing<00:03:58.959> components<00:04:01.739> this<00:04:02.739> here

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
specific printing components this here

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.870 
specific printing components this here
is<00:04:03.130> the<00:04:03.220> actual<00:04:03.760> printing<00:04:04.209> cell<00:04:05.609> how<00:04:06.609> this

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
is the actual printing cell how this

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.750 
is the actual printing cell how this
works<00:04:07.239> is<00:04:07.600> for<00:04:08.019> God<00:04:08.400> scratch<00:04:09.400> let's<00:04:09.609> just

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
works is for God scratch let's just

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.220 
works is for God scratch let's just
break<00:04:09.940> it<00:04:10.560> we've<00:04:11.560> got<00:04:11.769> egg<00:04:11.950> a<00:04:13.019> spawning<00:04:14.019> it

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
break it we've got egg a spawning it

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.330 
break it we've got egg a spawning it
this<00:04:14.560> one's<00:04:14.859> a<00:04:15.040> minecart<00:04:15.639> that<00:04:15.970> contains<00:04:16.450> a

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
this one's a minecart that contains a

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.420 
this one's a minecart that contains a
foreign<00:04:18.340> sand<00:04:18.700> entity<00:04:19.180> spawner<00:04:19.810> so<00:04:20.410> this<00:04:21.220> one

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
foreign sand entity spawner so this one

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.550 
foreign sand entity spawner so this one
here<00:04:21.609> spawns<00:04:22.060> a<00:04:22.330> falling<00:04:22.690> sand<00:04:22.930> into<00:04:23.169> gate

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
here spawns a falling sand into gate

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.830 
here spawns a falling sand into gate
with<00:04:23.860> the<00:04:23.979> idea<00:04:24.250> of<00:04:24.310> glass<00:04:24.669> and<00:04:24.970> we<00:04:25.270> break<00:04:25.570> that

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
with the idea of glass and we break that

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.240 
with the idea of glass and we break that
sea<00:04:26.530> glass<00:04:26.890> block

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
sea glass block

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.250 
sea glass block
for<00:04:27.990> now<00:04:28.990> in<00:04:29.710> here<00:04:30.190> is<00:04:30.430> lava<00:04:30.850> so<00:04:31.420> whenever<00:04:32.080> we

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
for now in here is lava so whenever we

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.840 
for now in here is lava so whenever we
pulse<00:04:33.240> basic<00:04:34.240> on<00:04:34.360> end<00:04:34.570> gate<00:04:34.900> system<00:04:35.140> so<00:04:35.850> this

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
pulse basic on end gate system so this

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.000 
pulse basic on end gate system so this
is<00:04:37.000> the<00:04:37.180> third<00:04:37.390> component<00:04:37.600> of<00:04:37.930> the<00:04:38.080> shift

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
is the third component of the shift

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:44.360 
is the third component of the shift
register<00:04:40.140> so<00:04:41.520> when<00:04:42.520> we<00:04:42.700> print<00:04:42.910> the<00:04:43.000> first<00:04:43.240> row

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
register so when we print the first row

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.120 
register so when we print the first row
these<00:04:45.930> torches<00:04:46.930> along<00:04:47.140> here<00:04:47.410> go<00:04:47.530> up<00:04:47.680> this

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
these torches along here go up this

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.740 
these torches along here go up this
basically<00:04:49.050> disables<00:04:50.050> the<00:04:51.330> repeater<00:04:52.330> lock<00:04:52.540> on

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
basically disables the repeater lock on

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.820 
basically disables the repeater lock on
the<00:04:53.230> store<00:04:53.500> chair<00:04:53.740> and<00:04:54.270> then<00:04:55.270> that<00:04:55.480> allows<00:04:55.830> the

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
the store chair and then that allows the

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.650 
the store chair and then that allows the
outputs<00:04:57.370> from<00:04:57.550> the<00:04:57.700> chest<00:04:58.000> to<00:04:58.150> be<00:04:58.270> pulsed

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
outputs from the chest to be pulsed

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.430 
outputs from the chest to be pulsed
through<00:04:58.930> and<00:05:00.660> through<00:05:01.660> and<00:05:01.690> down<00:05:01.990> into<00:05:02.320> the

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
through and through and down into the

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.840 
through and through and down into the
chest<00:05:02.710> go<00:05:03.700> into<00:05:04.090> the<00:05:04.210> dispenser<00:05:05.169> head<00:05:05.320> the

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
chest go into the dispenser head the

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:11.190 
chest go into the dispenser head the
dispenser<00:05:06.850> and<00:05:08.610> drops<00:05:09.610> lava<00:05:10.000> and<00:05:10.480> in<00:05:10.840> pics<00:05:11.080> it

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
dispenser and drops lava and in pics it

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.020 
dispenser and drops lava and in pics it
back<00:05:11.350> up<00:05:11.530> again<00:05:11.650> and<00:05:12.490> that<00:05:12.820> basically

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
back up again and that basically

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.230 
back up again and that basically
destroys<00:05:13.750> the<00:05:14.169> mine<00:05:14.680> cart<00:05:14.919> which<00:05:15.490> is<00:05:15.669> one<00:05:15.910> here

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
destroys the mine cart which is one here

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.740 
destroys the mine cart which is one here
like<00:05:16.810> that<00:05:16.990> and<00:05:17.070> so<00:05:18.070> can<00:05:18.310> respawn<00:05:18.669> and<00:05:19.030> when

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
like that and so can respawn and when

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.870 
like that and so can respawn and when
you<00:05:19.840> destroy<00:05:20.410> the<00:05:20.440> minecart<00:05:20.950> it<00:05:21.100> spawns<00:05:21.550> a

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
you destroy the minecart it spawns a

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.460 
you destroy the minecart it spawns a
blocks<00:05:23.730> destroying<00:05:24.730> wait<00:05:25.690> we<00:05:25.930> didn't<00:05:26.200> strike
