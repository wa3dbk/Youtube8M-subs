00:00:04.179 --> 00:00:07.672
- So this is a section
on navigating the book.

00:00:07.672 --> 00:00:11.857
We wanted to spend just a few
minutes telling you a little

00:00:11.857 --> 00:00:14.901
bit about truly just how
this book is organized.

00:00:14.901 --> 00:00:15.980
How it lays out.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.271
Just point out a couple
of features to you.

00:00:18.271 --> 00:00:20.903
We were very happy that
Heinemann was willing to let us

00:00:20.903 --> 00:00:24.030
use pretty important real
estate of the book which

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.353
is the inside front cover.

00:00:26.353 --> 00:00:29.352
And you might take a look
at that inside front cover

00:00:29.352 --> 00:00:33.931
pretty early on, it gives you
a quick overview of all six

00:00:33.931 --> 00:00:38.864
of the signposts, the clues
that actually help kids

00:00:38.864 --> 00:00:41.502
find those signposts in text.

00:00:41.502 --> 00:00:44.397
And then finally, what we
call the anchor question,

00:00:44.397 --> 00:00:47.559
the question that kids ought
to ask once they've looked

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.452
at the signpost, or found the signpost.

00:00:50.452 --> 00:00:54.433
As you look through just
the table of contents

00:00:54.433 --> 00:00:57.677
we want you to see that
the book is really divided

00:00:57.677 --> 00:00:59.487
into three major parts.

00:00:59.487 --> 00:01:01.965
The Questions We Pondered,
The Signposts We Found,

00:01:01.965 --> 00:01:04.105
and The Lessons We Teach.

00:01:04.105 --> 00:01:07.075
When you get to Part One, the
Questions We Pondered, take

00:01:07.075 --> 00:01:10.823
a look at any one those ten
questions and at the end

00:01:10.823 --> 00:01:14.431
of each of those you'll
see the series of prompts

00:01:14.431 --> 00:01:17.958
or questions, additional
questions that we think are worth

00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:19.541
exploring in your own school with your

00:01:19.541 --> 00:01:22.728
own professional learning community.

00:01:22.728 --> 00:01:25.977
When you move into The
Signposts We Found you'll see

00:01:25.977 --> 00:01:30.014
that that ends with a series
of questions and answers.

00:01:30.014 --> 00:01:34.130
And those are questions
that we had ourselves as we

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.935
actually started teaching
these signposts and the answers

00:01:38.935 --> 00:01:41.889
that we finally came up with on our own.

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:43.373
And therefore, we think they're questions

00:01:43.373 --> 00:01:44.774
you might have as well.

00:01:44.774 --> 00:01:47.693
And then the last part of the
book, The Lessons We Teach,

00:01:47.693 --> 00:01:51.375
actually gives you the
mentor text for teaching each

00:01:51.375 --> 00:01:54.934
of the six signposts, and shows you how we

00:01:54.934 --> 00:01:59.548
would move through each of
those lessons step by step.

00:01:59.548 --> 00:02:02.591
We also want you to know
that in the back there

00:02:02.591 --> 00:02:05.486
are a series of, uh,
templates that you can use

00:02:05.486 --> 00:02:06.794
in all sorts of ways.

00:02:06.794 --> 00:02:09.445
And those templates, most
of them were prepared by

00:02:09.445 --> 00:02:12.169
teachers who have been helping us work

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:14.691
with these signpost lessons.

00:02:14.691 --> 00:02:18.029
And we really appreciate
them taking the time to share

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:20.512
their templates with us
so that we could share

00:02:20.512 --> 00:02:22.064
them, in turn, with you.

00:02:22.064 --> 00:02:24.551
Those are also up at the
Notice and Notes signpost

00:02:24.551 --> 00:02:27.210
at the Heinemann webpage.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.790
When you get to the very back inside cover

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.986
it's another great, great piece.

00:02:31.986 --> 00:02:34.593
The teacher that's down
in the bottom left hand

00:02:34.593 --> 00:02:36.523
corner is Jenna Choa.

00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:39.860
She's a teacher at a public
school in New York City.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.857
Jen let us into her
classroom early on to start

00:02:42.857 --> 00:02:47.012
teaching the lessons and
she had really incredibly

00:02:47.012 --> 00:02:50.493
valuable information to share and she

00:02:50.493 --> 00:02:52.853
pushed our thinking tremendously.

00:02:52.853 --> 00:02:55.963
What she shared with you
here on this back page

00:02:55.963 --> 00:02:58.818
are the actual Notice and Note charts

00:02:58.818 --> 00:03:01.019
she's created for her classroom.

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.745
Because we think that one important part

00:03:03.745 --> 00:03:06.708
of teaching is lessons,
the signpost lessons,

00:03:06.708 --> 00:03:11.073
is not to do it on a
PowerPoint, but to actually

00:03:11.073 --> 00:03:14.019
create charts that can
stay up in the classroom.

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.707
The kids on the back cover,
just a quick shout out

00:03:17.707 --> 00:03:21.001
to them, these are children
in Sheridan, Arkansas,

00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:22.999
worked with them a couple of times.

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:24.207
They were super kids.

00:03:24.207 --> 00:03:27.539
All of the kids throughout
this book that are pictures

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:29.818
with us, are either
from Sheridan, Arkansas,

00:03:29.818 --> 00:03:33.985
Akron, Ohio, Orange County,
Florida, which is the Orlando

00:03:34.891 --> 00:03:39.496
area, or up in Jenna Choa's
classroom in New York City.

00:03:39.496 --> 00:03:42.303
And most of the teachers
are also from Sheridan,

00:03:42.303 --> 00:03:45.478
Arkansas or New York City so this book was

00:03:45.478 --> 00:03:48.806
a collaborative effort, not
only between the two of us

00:03:48.806 --> 00:03:52.227
but also us working with
a lot of teachers from

00:03:52.227 --> 00:03:53.980
a lot of different areas.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.946
One last thing just to talk about sort

00:03:56.946 --> 00:04:00.206
of the navigation issues of this book.

00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:03.963
We hope you'll take time
to read the pages that open

00:04:03.963 --> 00:04:06.608
each of the major sections.

00:04:06.608 --> 00:04:10.610
There you'll find a quote
from someone that's important

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.202
to us and we hope you'll
enjoy reading those.

00:04:14.202 --> 00:04:17.989
We've dedicated the book to
Louise Rosenblatt and we had

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.966
real specific reasons for doing that.

00:04:20.966 --> 00:04:25.133
- Now Louise was dedicated
to several important ideas

00:04:26.101 --> 00:04:30.686
and one of the most important
was that responsible,

00:04:30.686 --> 00:04:34.721
self-reliant readers are
critical to the preservation

00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:36.852
of a democratic society.

00:04:36.852 --> 00:04:41.216
She thought that the reader
had to be trained to encounter

00:04:41.216 --> 00:04:44.133
text with some rigor and attention,

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.781
and a sense of responsibility
for making sense out of what

00:04:49.781 --> 00:04:53.643
the text offered, bringing
it to bear upon the reader's

00:04:53.643 --> 00:04:57.709
life, and bringing the reader's
life to bear upon the text

00:04:57.709 --> 00:05:00.275
and in the transaction, to create

00:05:00.275 --> 00:05:03.535
sharper, refined good reading.

00:05:03.535 --> 00:05:08.085
Because good reading is
what enables us to preserve

00:05:08.085 --> 00:05:10.431
a democratic society.

00:05:10.431 --> 00:05:13.232
- So thanks for joining us
as we talked a little bit

00:05:13.232 --> 00:05:16.231
about just the navigational
issues of this book.

00:05:16.231 --> 00:05:17.512
I'm Kylene Beers.

00:05:17.512 --> 00:05:19.085
- And I'm Bob Probst.
