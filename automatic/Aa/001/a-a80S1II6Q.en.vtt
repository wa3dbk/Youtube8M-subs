00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:20.160
 This is our interviewee today and your solutions and carpentry accompany this 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.779
 interview and learn more about trends in decoration and 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.779
 bespoke furniture 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.380
 I made a background that was not defined for example 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.380
 and within that profile and the flowers that 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.249
 the furniture everything 

00:00:42.249 --> 00:00:45.129
 and profane leave it to design this coffee table 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.359
 because she hits rebate on the small one reception can support things that 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:50.230
 Do you like 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.839
 practically unchanged from a upholstered seat and I believe in it 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:58.140
 in this same place where the lap places the books also that the people 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.230
 beyond the gate 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.270
 so more current sector searching more I end up putting the 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.270
 press releases 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.740
 with the use of la-route furniture as a reserve of the heart of the East 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.469
 contractual directly pockets or again from the Arabs 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.420
 the request made from demolition wood 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.840
 coast at the moment Brazil wants more easier to find 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:25.400
 is the demolition floor for example 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.630
 so have you used it as if here in my house 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.440
 no pisa has used as wall cladding 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.360
 of furniture 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.570
 creating side tables and no promises of dinner I have used in his 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.270
 project 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.380
 this is a more affordable thing which contrasts completely 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:44.090
 with all the modernity, right? 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.759
 and it can of course be said here 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.759
 or it can be run by nash 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.290
 to make the division between free office 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.870
 blankets with god design an unusually sliding door 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.519
 the poor of ourselves images of contrasts he the government I tell you 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.779
 creates a special effect 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:21.509
 we pretend in black 

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:24.509
 kleber meneze years she 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.290
 then having a whole redone texture 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.379
 so you want this passage of idleness tried floor 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:36.190
 as this wall lined with the door to adopt the nice balance 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.610
 in the whole course of modernity that are marks 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.290
 are tailor's fabrics are so modern things on the tables repaired more 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.630
 I will have contraction counted on all the rest 

00:02:58.259 --> 00:03:00.430
 so I do not know what it feels like 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.110
 was chosen to design the book's suspended bookcase 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:09.739
 with geometric designs the group the ministers are bento in pieces 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.089
 decoration of new property 

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:13.599
 how I like 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:18.989
 be more orderly things and in this case are folders and clients and some 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.540
 research material so I chose 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.909
 by quadricular 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:25.560
 tocoma lakshimi glow 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.080
 that gave the whole state 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.560
 and finished 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.870
 giving a unit along with the white wall vest 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.530
 with the sextant next to my desk, 

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:51.340
 careful drawers below when I put all paperwork documentation 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.449
 but important and at the top are the ministers who are squared 

00:03:56.449 --> 00:04:00.629
 there I always had the custody of my books that I love my beginning in the books 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:02.520
 objects of art 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.520
 the decorative leaked 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:11.819
 the complete execution of projects 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:16.519
 should be based on the study cast travers of the research of new trends 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.819
 and especially the partnership of the professionals involved to achieve the 

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:24.819
 long-awaited success for the end customer 

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:31.469
 71 the person responsible is not 

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:34.710
 has a drawing but if it does not perform well the piece 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.810
 and the material that the choice was not good 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.470
 will give problem will not be finalized madrigal then everyone he is 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.639
 co-responsible I design cool 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:47.250
 he performs coolly in a nice way because if it is true that it has been updated 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.930
 so people are in search of pleasure what they think of themselves 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.930
 professionalize more he wants to learn more 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.720
 he wants to have a more cutting edge material on the market then at every 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.069
 study search there is no magic does not exist 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:08.139
 nowadays in mobility and differentiated solutions and real estate 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:11.230
 I am at my customers' disposal 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:14.680
 offering one of the few of the benefit 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.529
 viatri activity not costly hcosta 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:22.939
 just have searched and used the available truth materials 

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:26.430
 the material Indians but these 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.159
 the tissues the cans the resins 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:31.220
 everything has been perfected 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.370
 to have greater resistance 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.009
 to Brazil three points to g1 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:40.300
 so why was it researched a lot factories offer a lot today 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.969
 This is very important that the end customer is heartfelt much more 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:48.189
 If you have a mobile if you are five years from now, you 

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:52.029
