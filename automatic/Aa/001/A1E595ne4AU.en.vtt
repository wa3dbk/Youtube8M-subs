the<00:02:31.720> techniques<00:02:32.109> in<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.380> course<00:02:32.620> will<00:02:32.859> work

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
the techniques in the course will work

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.920 
the techniques in the course will work
the<00:02:33.190> same<00:02:33.370> way<00:02:33.609> as<00:02:33.850> if<00:02:34.030> I<00:02:34.150> were<00:02:34.299> developing<00:02:34.810> a

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
the same way as if I were developing a

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.500 
the same way as if I were developing a
new<00:02:35.109> site<00:02:35.440> but<00:02:36.250> using<00:02:36.549> an<00:02:36.640> existing<00:02:37.120> site<00:02:37.329> will

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
new site but using an existing site will

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.360 
new site but using an existing site will
provide<00:02:37.540> some<00:02:38.019> ready-made<00:02:38.319> content<00:02:39.040> to<00:02:39.220> work

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
provide some ready-made content to work

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.410 
provide some ready-made content to work
with<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:42.010> extension<00:02:42.549> I<00:02:42.639> use<00:02:42.790> for<00:02:42.970> formatting

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
with the extension I use for formatting

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.120 
with the extension I use for formatting
much<00:02:43.660> of<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:43.900> content<00:02:44.290> on<00:02:44.470> this<00:02:44.590> site<00:02:44.650> is

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
much of the content on this site is

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.300 
much of the content on this site is
called<00:02:45.220> rack<00:02:45.700> so<00:02:46.410> it's<00:02:47.410> a<00:02:47.560> nice<00:02:47.680> module<00:02:48.190> that

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
called rack so it's a nice module that

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.039 
called rack so it's a nice module that
allows<00:02:48.609> you<00:02:48.730> to<00:02:48.819> quickly<00:02:49.000> and<00:02:49.209> easily<00:02:49.389> format

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
allows you to quickly and easily format

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.620 
allows you to quickly and easily format
content<00:02:50.620> in<00:02:50.799> different<00:02:50.980> ways<00:02:51.340> however<00:02:52.209> it

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
content in different ways however it

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.680 
content in different ways however it
doesn't<00:02:52.959> provide<00:02:53.200> comments<00:02:53.859> ratings<00:02:54.690> tagging

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.050 
doesn't provide comments ratings tagging
additional<00:02:56.410> fields<00:02:56.859> or<00:02:57.069> most<00:02:57.639> of<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.910> other

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
features k2 provides so I had to install

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.460 
features k2 provides so I had to install
several<00:03:01.329> different<00:03:01.660> components<00:03:02.200> to<00:03:02.260> get

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
several different components to get

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.550 
several different components to get
those<00:03:02.680> capabilities<00:03:03.130> in<00:03:04.049> the<00:03:05.049> next<00:03:05.290> session

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
those capabilities in the next session

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.170 
those capabilities in the next session
we'll<00:03:05.709> get<00:03:05.829> started<00:03:06.069> by<00:03:06.400> installing<00:03:06.549> and

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
we'll get started by installing and

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.130 
we'll get started by installing and
configuring<00:03:07.209> the<00:03:08.019> k2<00:03:08.290> component
