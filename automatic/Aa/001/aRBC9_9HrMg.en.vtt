00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
sure where the weekend he certainly

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.940 
sure where the weekend he certainly
looked<00:04:25.750> like<00:04:25.780> it's<00:04:25.990> very<00:04:26.440> close<00:04:26.710> to<00:04:26.860> the

looked like it's very close to the
ground<00:04:27.130> I<00:04:27.310> think<00:04:27.340> that's<00:04:27.610> a<00:04:27.700> try<00:04:27.910> it's<00:04:28.750> on<00:04:28.840> the

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
ground I think that's a try it's on the

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.270 
ground I think that's a try it's on the
deck<00:04:29.140> is<00:04:29.470> it<00:04:29.710> short

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
deck is it short

is<00:04:31.180> it<00:04:31.450> short<00:04:31.690> or<00:04:31.840> is<00:04:31.930> it<00:04:32.050> on<00:04:32.170> the<00:04:32.260> line<00:04:32.410> is<00:04:32.590> it

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
is it short or is it on the line is it

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.800 
is it short or is it on the line is it
over<00:04:32.950> the<00:04:33.070> line<00:04:33.220> I<00:04:33.490> think<00:04:34.120> that's<00:04:34.480> over<00:04:34.630> the

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
over the line I think that's over the

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.690 
over the line I think that's over the
line<00:04:34.840> looking<00:04:35.260> at<00:04:35.350> the<00:04:35.530> line<00:04:36.220> in<00:04:36.460> the<00:04:36.580> way

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
line looking at the line in the way

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.830 
line looking at the line in the way
continues<00:04:37.450> across<00:04:38.460> but<00:04:39.460> is<00:04:39.790> it<00:04:39.970> short<00:04:40.270> looks

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
continues across but is it short looks

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.650 
continues across but is it short looks
like<00:04:40.960> they're<00:04:41.080> going<00:04:41.200> to<00:04:41.260> go<00:04:41.350> for<00:04:41.560> it
