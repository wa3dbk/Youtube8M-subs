00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.679
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:23.370
 Yasuhisa Shimashita I introduce Lexus isf dynamic sports tuning this time 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:28.800
 I would like 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:30.240
 isf debuted in October 2005 in 2007 as an application Lexus 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.320
 It opened in Japan 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:39.480
 Well high performance based on Lexus medium sedan iso 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.700
 Appeared as a version is then at 2.5 liters and two 3.5 liters 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.390
 Was equipped with the v6 engine 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.739
 Against this is f 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:53.770
 Is the Lexus sound top range ls 600 h 5 used here 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:57.850
 Liter v8 is now loading the engine by combining the body to a dedicated established in it 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:03.090
 Eg bmwm 3 mercedes benz c 63 amg 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:08.250
 It appeared as a sport model that can be countered 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.520
 It appeared in isf at that time I'd earlier than hyper Well compact body 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.729
 Also 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:17.310
 I have a memory that it was a fairly rough car to be honest 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:21.360
 But it Lexus also it is well understood that later almost every year this car as 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.110
 I will continue to evolve Well tuning of the suspension almost every year 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.080
 Change 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.630
 Something like that 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.870
 Even if it is carried and carried, it has achieved the sound evolution that I think it became a really good car 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:35.720
 The 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:40.670
 The base is itself has been transitioned to a new model with a full model change in 2013 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:45.980
 However, only the cat's iss still has the model in front of it 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:49.890
 Lexus will probably end up with this isf on a special car 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.750
 Has just been Well kind of consideration and like to decorated the Yushunobi in the history of cat Te 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.870
 It is why say 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:59.310
 First, look at the appearance of the carbon front spoiler 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:01.560
 And has a dedicated rear diffuser In addition to the brake caliper dedicated 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:07.350
 Finally to become colored type 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:10.380
 One Dan muffler 7 Stan muffler to achieve a weight reduction of the company is already mounted 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:14.400
 The biggest change is the engine 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.209
 Head cover with orange accent This is the same color as the brake caliper 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:21.209
 But 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:24.510
 This engine hidden behind it is less likely to reduce friction of pistons and pumps 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.890
 And it is said that the liner Mick engine balance and it is on the crankshaft 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.340
 Connecting rod and piston 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:33.310
 Balance in the assembled state 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:36.640
 The to and Well have so kind of Well fine sound technique is used using a Well the best mainstay 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:41.709
 We raise from 423 urine to 430 bytes 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:44.060
 Feeling say Well and important tuning in just ne Well maybe above its specs 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.090
 I think I can do something 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:50.379
 For example is the Interior 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:53.920
 It is equipped with a car name 8 that is considered to be specially equipped 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:58.989
 Carbon panel a It is only that, but isf itself 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:04.360
 It, such as steering of the river that contains the only sport seat is and Kako of dimples 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:06.080
 Well I feel say Do is equipped with everything you need it as a sports model 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:11.000
 And most characteristic 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:14.630
 This is a meter panel This meter panel with a large tachometer in the center 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.830
 In fact, it was adopted from the model change of 2010 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:24.470
 I think it's hard to come home on the way like this 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:30.230
 Well, I also feel that it is one of the well-felt commitments of the isf 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:34.220
 It is easy to see here. There are no seats in the center and two people are anxious. 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:38.390
 Instead, that support is also solid 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.720
 It becomes such a sheet that will hold properly even if the driver flies 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.670
 Ne 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.460
 Enough that I feel that not a certain margin or will be spatially Yes surprising and images 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.380
 Ne 4 door 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:54.110
 I feel that also wonder if there is the ease of use of the run 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:57.800
 It is luggage space The opening is wide enough and there is capacity There is trunk through 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:02.840
 But they can not do so in the so-called rear seat 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:06.890
 Well it also means in the sense that body rigidity is kept in mind by being a sports model 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.580
 I think this is a good idea if you think Well I'm more than that ceiling Necchan 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.400
 To the end 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.689
 The carpet is 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.890
 It is also true that such high quality of quality is also such a Lexus 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:18.640
 It is a part that makes you feel 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:21.120
 Then I would like to see the evolution of this dynamic sports tuning 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.120
 think
