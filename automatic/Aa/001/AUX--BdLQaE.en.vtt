Hello Polynesians!

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.140
Well today before starting the

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.690
challenge we have an announcement for people living in Los Angeles.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.520
- That's right, we're going there for a while. - One year, no, it's not true.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.360
- No, a week. - Yes, we're going to be there for a week and

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.180
that's because the Muses channel is the tutorial, where Lesslie and I do tutorials

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.060
If you do not know it below, we leave you the link to go to the channel and subscribe.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:39.000
YouTube made a contest called "Next Latino" and there won Musas and they will send us to where?

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.860
To Los Angeles for a training and to learn new things to improve the channel.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.320
Exaclyt! So being there we will take to make a meeting with the Polynesians

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.330
from there, I know we could do it in the D.F., we have not made any meeting but

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.120
because we are going to be there we will take advantage. And then this good we will be there the week

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.620

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.440
exactly what day we are going to see, somewhere in L.A.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.740
Exactly, then look for the Polynesians of L.A. because we are going to make a meeting with you.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.320

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.200
hat is called "the challenge of the elastic bands" that sent us for FB.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.680
And it's about putting the elastic bands you can in your face.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.340
Whoever has more leagues wins. 1, 2 3!

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.040
Ouch how painful! Oh my brain is clenching!

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.160
They are very small! They would have bought bigger ones.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.520
- Now the ideas are getting tight. - Oh, do not pass!

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.000
Oh my ears!

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.780
Oh, do not pass!

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.280
- They smell super ugly. - Yes it smells...

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.800
Why did not you buy small bands? - It was the ones Rafa had.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.800
What Polynesians came up with this idea? Oh, Polynesians!

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.560
My brain hurts. Oh, I do not see!

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.300
I see nothing.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.120
Oh my ideas!

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.520
I see nothing!

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.820
Oh no, this is ...!

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.900
I do not have an eye anymore!

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.640
You look like a sausage.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.680
- I do not have an eye anymore, I'm a pirate. - Do not pass

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.120
Oh my ear!

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.700
Hello polyneisses!

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.600
- I can not see the eyes and I have them all covered. - One if you have it open

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.060
- Already! do not? not yet? - I do not know ...

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.380
I do not see anymore!

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.520
Now if not anymore!

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.400
- Oh it tastes horrible! - Why do they eat them?

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.700
How I look? How do I look like Polynesians?

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.140
Oh no!

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.920
Oh no! - Oh Lord! - I already have cellulite.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.040
- You look Korean. - Do I look Korean?

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.840
Yes.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.980
Do not pass! I already have a bad pain all over my face.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:09.960
Me too.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.080
I can not anymore. How many did you do?

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.800
1. No, I'm still putting.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.880
- Not now. - Already?

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.280
Yes. Oh my hair!

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.800
- Do not pass! - Put it like that and those that are putting put them here.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.280
Go 1, 2, 3.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.160
Do not pass my head! I have all the links here, look at this all tangled up.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.040
And if we cut them?

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.640
You're not going to whip yourself. My hair, my hair!

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.640
They already made me cry. Ok now

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.460
I have all in my hair, to see what I have to do.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:57.240
1.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:59.760
They left and they made me cry.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.800
Let's see. Oh no, this is!

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.720
Do not! Her hair.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.900
It seems that a dog bit you. Hello Polynesians! A dog just bite Rafa.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:27.860
Turn to the camera ...

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.480
- Do not pass! you got tangled - Oh no! do not tell me that.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.120
Let's see.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.480
Oh, take away that one that is crushing my brain.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.360
- It's turning purple. - Yes, take them off.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.480
That is the one that follows.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.100
Scissors?

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.160
Yes. Cut here.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.040
- Where do I cut? - Here cut here. Cut here

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:12.260

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.140
There it is! Ouch how painful!

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:37.320
My head hurts a lot

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.540
Well in this challenge Karen and I won, good draw.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.400
So no.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.320

of challenges we have done visit this page, there are all the points and all the challenges we have made.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.240
You will ask yourself what the points are for

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.800
- I do want to know what the points are for. - What are the points for?

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.460
You will decide at some point in history.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.560
- And my brother ... - For something they have to serve, someday

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.560
Someday we will do something. With the team, all those who support us in

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.040
that team will probably have something, or something we will do.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:20.449
- Something we're going to do one day with the points. - I know, better write us down here in the comments

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:24.960
what idea has for those who are winning, we lose.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.669
