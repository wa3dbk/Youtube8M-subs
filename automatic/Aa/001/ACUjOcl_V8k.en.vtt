and I have seen similar sizing issues

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.830 
and I have seen similar sizing issues
with<00:01:10.400> my<00:01:10.520> customers<00:01:10.940> typically<00:01:11.420> you<00:01:11.510> have<00:01:11.570> to

go up at least one man's eyes if you're

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.600 
go up at least one man's eyes if you're
between<00:01:14.090> two<00:01:14.330> band<00:01:14.540> sizes<00:01:14.780> like<00:01:15.260> 38<00:01:16.100> and<00:01:16.250> 40

you<00:01:16.850> might<00:01:17.000> actually<00:01:17.210> even<00:01:17.570> have<00:01:17.690> to<00:01:17.780> go<00:01:17.870> up

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
you might actually even have to go up

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.460 
you might actually even have to go up
one<00:01:17.990> more<00:01:18.140> to<00:01:18.590> say<00:01:18.740> 42<00:01:19.450> the<00:01:20.450> cup<00:01:20.810> runs<00:01:21.080> about

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
panache super broad line I found that

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.420 
panache super broad line I found that
that's<00:01:25.910> almost<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:26.510> best<00:01:27.040> baseline<00:01:28.040> for

that's almost the best baseline for

identifying what cup size you should go
up<00:01:30.290> to<00:01:30.430> so<00:01:31.430> 32<00:01:32.030> double<00:01:32.420> H<00:01:32.510> for<00:01:32.780> me<00:01:32.870> actually

moving in the store because I feel like
my<00:03:04.660> arms<00:03:05.020> keep<00:03:05.290> hitting<00:03:05.830> breast<00:03:06.130> tissue<00:03:06.340> and

my arms keep hitting breast tissue and

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.490 
my arms keep hitting breast tissue and
it's<00:03:06.760> not<00:03:06.880> as<00:03:07.000> comfortable<00:03:07.209> this<00:03:08.049> makes<00:03:08.380> sure

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
it's not as comfortable this makes sure

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.140 
it's not as comfortable this makes sure
that<00:03:08.739> everything<00:03:09.220> stays<00:03:09.250> front<00:03:09.760> and<00:03:09.880> center

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
that everything stays front and center

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.320 
that everything stays front and center
very<00:03:10.720> high<00:03:10.989> and<00:03:11.140> rounded<00:03:11.470> like<00:03:11.650> it<00:03:11.769> should

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
very high and rounded like it should

very high and rounded like it should
now<00:03:13.330> I<00:03:13.360> also<00:03:13.630> don't<00:03:13.959> have<00:03:14.170> any<00:03:14.320> issues<00:03:14.590> with

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
padded cup bras because I typically have

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.100 
padded cup bras because I typically have
breast<00:03:21.970> tissue<00:03:22.180> that's<00:03:22.450> sitting<00:03:22.780> anywhere

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
breast tissue that's sitting anywhere

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.940 
breast tissue that's sitting anywhere
from<00:03:23.230> a<00:03:23.320> quarter<00:03:23.500> of<00:03:23.680> an<00:03:23.769> inch<00:03:23.799> to

three-quarters of an inch above the

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
underwire and I was a little worried

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.850 
underwire and I was a little worried
particularly<00:03:28.540> with<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:29.019> way<00:03:29.260> the<00:03:29.410> connexin

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
particularly with the way the connexin

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.650 
particularly with the way the connexin
shape<00:03:30.100> looked<00:03:30.370> that<00:03:30.610> I<00:03:30.640> would<00:03:30.910> experience<00:03:31.360> the

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
shape looked that I would experience the

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.890 
shape looked that I would experience the
same<00:03:31.840> issue<00:03:32.079> I<00:03:32.470> also<00:03:33.310> was<00:03:33.730> concerned<00:03:33.910> that<00:03:34.450> the

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
same issue I also was concerned that the

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.600 
same issue I also was concerned that the
thinner<00:03:35.140> padding<00:03:35.590> here<00:03:35.799> was<00:03:36.070> not<00:03:36.280> going<00:03:36.519> to

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
thinner padding here was not going to

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:37.800 
thinner padding here was not going to
withstand<00:03:36.880> the<00:03:37.150> weight<00:03:37.269> of<00:03:37.480> the<00:03:37.630> breast

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
withstand the weight of the breast

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.060 
withstand the weight of the breast
tissue<00:03:37.959> and<00:03:38.260> it<00:03:38.320> was<00:03:38.470> going<00:03:38.680> to<00:03:38.799> kind<00:03:39.010> of

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
tissue and it was going to kind of

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.410 
tissue and it was going to kind of
crumple<00:03:39.310> it<00:03:39.519> I've<00:03:39.610> had<00:03:39.760> that<00:03:39.880> happen<00:03:40.120> in<00:03:40.360> the

crumple it I've had that happen in the

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.140 
crumple it I've had that happen in the
past<00:03:40.450> too<00:03:40.930> with<00:03:41.079> padded<00:03:41.440> bras<00:03:41.700> however<00:03:42.700> that

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.380 
is not the case here I don't have any
space<00:03:45.070> at<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.370> bottom<00:03:45.489> of<00:03:45.730> the<00:03:45.850> cup<00:03:46.030> and<00:03:46.269> I'm
