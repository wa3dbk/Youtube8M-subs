 I am dave and 31 that today I bring you some 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.430
 helmets that I recently bought 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:24.590
 for playstation 4 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.590

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:34.370
 and nothing to tell you that previously bought 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.930
 the tactile xp look very good helmets 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.930
 helmets but I did not make them 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.570
 and I did not like the roll so much 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.360
 cable on the ground and so on and I decided 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.170
 sell them and buy others that were 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.050
 wifi to not have 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.500
 and wired on the ground and the truth that 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.500
 very happy very comfortable 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.990
 Easy to install for playstation are worth 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.090

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:05.050

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:09.670

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:16.600

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:19.740
 come with a sound card that is 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.470
 this one is not appreciated well 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.250
 I'm going to catch 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.250
 sound card 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.130

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.340
 is connected by optical cable to the 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.770
 playstation 4 and usb cable to take out 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.190
 the sound of the video I can wear 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.320
 when and the chat is worth 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.930
 it is very simple to use this is 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:51.210
 simply connect it and it detects it to the 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:55.159
 first you have the button 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.159
 to turn up the volume to lower the volume 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.829
 in addition to this mode in scout mode 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.920
 It is a mode that is mainly used 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.229
 for games 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.849
 call of duty and battlefield type and so on 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:15.780
 is a mode that accentuates the sounds more 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:18.090
 soft as for example the steps and you 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.450
 can give a certain advantage at the time 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.700
 to play as you see here you have several 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.069
 modes to be in ps3 mode is like 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:31.120

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.350
 this is the mic button that is the button 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:38.490
 for 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.490
 and reduce the 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.240
 good that the micro is well worth 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.520
 you do not have your voice interference 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:52.380

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:54.960

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.880

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.890
 and the helmets 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.120
 generally good all plastic the 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:11.959
 leather pads are very soft 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.959
 very soft 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.190
 the micro is 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.630
 modify it to your liking 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.980
 fully adjustable the truth that has 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.019
 a pretty nice design 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.319
 and they go perfectly with the play has a 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:36.349
 scope as it says on the web about 10 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:40.180
 meters but I've tried it all over the 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:41.950
 home and you hear perfectly everything 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.170
 and nothing I wanted to do this video because 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.569

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.090
