things that Rick has told me is the way
they<00:00:33.720> build<00:00:34.230> their<00:00:34.410> propellers<00:00:34.890> now<00:00:35.460> with<00:00:35.640> the

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
they build their propellers now with the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.190 
they build their propellers now with the
aluminum<00:00:36.180> propellers<00:00:36.600> making<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.989> big

aluminum propellers making a big

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.920 
aluminum propellers making a big
difference<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.880> using<00:00:38.880> squeeze<00:00:39.210> casting<00:00:39.780> in

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
difference is using squeeze casting in

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.680 
difference is using squeeze casting in
which<00:00:40.200> case<00:00:40.860> they're<00:00:41.130> casting<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.180> prop<00:00:42.450> from

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
which case they're casting the prop from

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.210 
which case they're casting the prop from
underneath<00:00:43.170> that's<00:00:43.320> going<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.740> vertically

under high speed and high pressure and

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.870 
under high speed and high pressure and
what<00:00:46.380> that<00:00:46.560> does<00:00:46.740> is<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.130> helps<00:00:47.160> eliminate<00:00:47.640> a

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:47.880 
what that does is it helps eliminate a
