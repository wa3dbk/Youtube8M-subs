well she was five point nine on
difficulty<00:01:38.640> in<00:01:38.759> qualification<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.600> she<00:01:39.659> could

let's<00:01:59.520> have<00:01:59.640> another<00:01:59.729> look<00:01:59.970> but<00:02:00.780> she<00:02:00.899> made<00:02:01.080> a

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
let's have another look but she made a

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.020 
let's have another look but she made a
decision<00:02:01.350> didn't<00:02:01.950> she<00:02:02.069> she<00:02:02.130> sacrificed<00:02:02.819> the

decision didn't she she sacrificed the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.480 
decision didn't she she sacrificed the
fluidity<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.600> little<00:02:03.929> bit<00:02:04.080> to<00:02:04.770> be<00:02:04.890> sure<00:02:05.190> of

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
fluidity a little bit to be sure of

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.870 
fluidity a little bit to be sure of
every<00:02:06.149> element<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.929> think<00:02:07.459> as<00:02:08.459> Christine

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
every element and I think as Christine

every element and I think as Christine
was<00:02:09.090> saying<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.840> judges<00:02:10.229> will<00:02:10.350> pick<00:02:10.560> up<00:02:10.799> a

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
was saying the judges will pick up a

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.910 
was saying the judges will pick up a
lack<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.459> connection<00:02:11.850> maybe<00:02:12.600> but<00:02:13.590> she<00:02:13.739> was

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
lack of connection maybe but she was

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.900 
lack of connection maybe but she was
very<00:02:14.220> accurate

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
very accurate

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.820 
very accurate
she<00:02:15.660> was<00:02:15.780> very<00:02:15.959> accurate<00:02:16.230> they<00:02:16.620> have<00:02:16.799> a

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
she was very accurate they have a

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.130 
she was very accurate they have a
deduction<00:02:17.370> for<00:02:17.519> lack<00:02:17.700> of<00:02:17.730> rhythm<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:18.450> look

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
deduction for lack of rhythm and look

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.039 
deduction for lack of rhythm and look
lack<00:02:19.560> of<00:02:19.739> sureness<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.580> movement<00:02:21.209> which<00:02:21.840> if

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
lack of sureness of movement which if

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.229 
lack of sureness of movement which if
they<00:02:22.260> want<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:22.980> they<00:02:23.250> could<00:02:23.489> apply<00:02:23.700> that<00:02:23.790> to

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
they want to they could apply that to

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.300 
they want to they could apply that to
the<00:02:24.329> routine<00:02:24.720> but<00:02:24.930> it's<00:02:25.110> very<00:02:25.380> dependent<00:02:25.829> on

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
the routine but it's very dependent on

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:34.550 
the routine but it's very dependent on
how<00:02:26.820> they<00:02:27.150> view<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.989> performance

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.720 

it's<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:35.590> big<00:02:35.739> deal<00:02:35.950> when<00:02:36.189> you<00:02:36.280> haven't<00:02:36.549> done<00:02:36.700> a

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
it's a big deal when you haven't done a

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.759 
it's a big deal when you haven't done a
lot<00:02:36.790> of<00:02:36.939> gymnastics<00:02:37.569> here<00:02:37.689> to<00:02:37.900> get<00:02:38.049> up<00:02:38.139> and<00:02:38.379> do

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
lot of gymnastics here to get up and do

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.580 
lot of gymnastics here to get up and do
a<00:02:38.799> beam<00:02:39.129> routine<00:02:39.819> in<00:02:40.719> front<00:02:40.749> of<00:02:41.079> everybody
