00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.900
 NASA wants to identify an asteroid 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.640
 in deep space find a 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.560
 way to capture it push it 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.540
 gently towards our planetary zone 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.460
 and then put it into orbit around 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:27.220
 the moon announced to the agency on 10 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.140
 April 2013 the dangers of the 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.760
 asteroids and its fall on earth is a 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.900
 topic that has acquired a greater urgency 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.900
 in the last times 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.510
 despite the fall of tons of 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.309
 material every day from space towards 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.110
 the earth does most of it in 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.370
 form of rock dust the size of a 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.829
 fist that become stars 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.329
 fleeting the nasa has had for a long 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.739
 time a program to identify and 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.420
 study the asteroids near the 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:53.160
 land but your focus and your budget 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.890
 has been growing in recent years 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.200
 in February 2013 a meteorite of 11 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.180
 one thousand tons exploded between 10 and 16 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.120
 miles above the skies of the 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.339
 Russian city of Chelyabinsk explosion 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.260
 which was between 20 and 30 times more powerful 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.080
 that the atomic bombs dropped on 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.090
 Hiroshima and Nagasaki caused more than 1500 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.610
 injured mostly due to 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.950
 broken glass 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.290
 at the same time a much larger asteroid 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.930
 he went through the earth only 16 more hours 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.640
 He flew over without causing damage but 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.110
 further increased the concern of the 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.940
 nasa for the risks of the many 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.070
 asteroids that exist in our 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.720
 commuter and support the need to give 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.740
 greater attention to what is called 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.740
 planetary defense 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.900
 the idea may sound more like science 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.760
 fiction that to national politics but in 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.320
 reality meets the key objectives 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.160
 of the Obama administration and the 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.160
 space community 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.510
 those goals include learning to 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.340
 identify asteroids 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.740
 they direct us and change their 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.690
 course the search for destinations where 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.430
 astronauts can go in their attempt to 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.740
 learn to make the longest trip to 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.880
 Mars and provide opportunities for 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.880
 space investors 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.970
 as planned in a new video of 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.830
 the NASA the asteroid would be trapped and 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.099
 surrounded next by a cover 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.930
 large and flexible then it will be towed 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.980
 for a spaceship with two panels 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.980
 large solar 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.410
 a robotic spacecraft could 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.710
 drag an asteroid near the 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.640
 23 feet and 500 tons earth 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.220
 using the available technology 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.290
 at present 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.480
 for the institute's scientists that 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.730
 for space studies at the institute 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.280
 california technology the project 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.720
 It costs 2600 million dollars but 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.250
 the officials of the nasa think that 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.250
 their effort would cost them much less 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.239
 that's because the nasa will bring much more 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.530
 near the asteroid land and 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.090
 because the agency is already 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.800
 spending millions on rockets and 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.900
 related technologies 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.220
 the asteroid proposal was part of 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.040
 presenting the budget of the 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.660
 nasa for 2014 a part of the budget 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.280
 broader federal than the president 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.680
 Barack Obama released on Wednesday 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.350
 which included an initial sum of 104 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.950
 million for the project 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.450
 charles bolden 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.610
 the administrator of the big nasa this 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.050
 period said the plan could continue 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.210
 forward only if the federal government 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.920
 reverse the cuts made as 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.020
 consequence of the recent reduction of 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.600
 budget in a presentation the 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.420
 associate administrator of the nasa robert 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.310
 light food drew the schedule of the 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.040
 agency for the mission selection of 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.740
 objectives in 2016 capture the 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.630
 asteroid in 2019 and the first 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:40.160
 visit to the rock of an astronaut he 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.160
 moved to 2021 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.380
 the asteroids come in many forms 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.060
 from piles of rubble that barely 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.460
 hold together by their own gravity 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.040
 up dense balls of iron and nickel 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.870
 poldi mottaki one of the scientists of the 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.940
 institute that is working in the 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.010
 project said that the proper asteroid 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.230
 must have the consistency of dry mud 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.720
 finding the right asteroid will not be 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.340
 easy said of mottaki because of the 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.170
 limitation of size and power of 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.360
 push of the capsule trailer that 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.750
 will send to the asteroid the rock itself not 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.310
 It can be more than 1000 tons is 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.109
 more has to be in a trajectory 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.750
 make it easy to take her near the 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.549
 earth and the moon even without tow the 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.530
 capture spacecraft added of 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.419
 mottaki would not have enough energy and 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.090
 fuel to change drastically 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:30.510
 the trajectory of an asteroid from 500 to 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.510
 1000 tons 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.560
 the highest concentration of asteroids in 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.500
 orbit in the solar system is in the 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.910
 Main belt between Mars and Jupiter 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.220
 but the nasa looks for one in the 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.380
 near the earth 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.140
 the asteroid could be put into orbit 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.730
 to the moon or at point l 1 of the great 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.410
 near the moon where the pull 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.130
 gravitational of the earth and the moon are 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.130
 almost equal 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.040
 Another reason given to support the project 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.840
 of the recovery of asteroids 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.100
 consists of the number quickly 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.830
 growing companies and projects 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.870
 commercial space several companies 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.580
 mining companies have proposed to exploit the 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.740
 asteroids to extract metals 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.590
 rare and valuable that are believed to carry 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.360
 and have a potential mine so close 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.900
 could quickly stimulate the 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.900
 developing
