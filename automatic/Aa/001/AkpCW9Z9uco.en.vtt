00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.240
 today what are you 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.160
 offers good solange I propose you 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.960
 beef samosas it's a recipe 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.960
 delicious that can be used to 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.519
 the appetizer as input then for 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.310
 to make the oxen samosas there you 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.410
 must 350 grams of beef an onion 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.160
 chopped menu two teaspoons of 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.800
 cumin 2 teaspoons of turmeric a 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.900
 half teaspoon chilli 2 cloves 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.720
 chopped garlic a handful of raisins 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.239
 that we will rehydrate beforehand 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.660
 a teaspoon of chopped mint and 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.579
 a tablespoon of chopped coriander 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.739
 sometimes we start then to realize 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.469
 the samossas we will first put the 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.670
 meat in the dish and mix the 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.670
 meat with herbs 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.480
 little trick to chisel mint and 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.559
 coriander we simply arm 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.100
 a pair of scissors 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:02.489
 so I superimpose the leaves and I 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:07.560
 go unrolled so that they are more 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.180
 easy to discover the look of just 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.390
 fresh coriander and peas 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.010
 two sides it will not be written 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.509
 mix the meat well with the 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.229
 aromatics so that they impregnate well 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.509
 of all flavors 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.159
 we will now seize it on high heat 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.159
 with a little olive oil 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.760
 then our meat is ready we go 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.620
 now add the small peas small 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.000
 info for the peas if you 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.470
 choose fresh you cook them to 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 water but you do not mix them is not to 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.650
 meat when cooking 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.990
 by cons if you choose them 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:51.430
 box wanted to simply book and 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:53.470
 you add them to the end it does not we 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.630
 remains more than just mixing and making 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.580
 the samossas to make samosas 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.650
 you need sheets of brick on 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.910
 folding seems complicated but when we have 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.460
 took a hand it's cake 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.979
 how do we get solange because the 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.649
 brick sheet there I see it I say to myself 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.660
 that I will not tear it at all 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.380
 just first impregnate it a little bit 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.360
 melted butter 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.730
 then the brick sheet as you have 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.680
 said it's very fine so we'll cut it 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.270
 in the middle and fold it back to have 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.690
 more thickness when we add the 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.120
 prank call 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.050
 okay, it will prevent this from happening 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.050
 exactly through 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.930
 once we have separated the sheet of 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:39.030
 brig in two we must remember to link the 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.989
 round party on the verge of bankruptcy 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.150
 agree we do what we want to achieve 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.610
 it's a take a big rectangle 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.540
 absolutely we put the value of a 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.879
 spoonful of stuffing on the edge of 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.060
 our brick sheets 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:57.810
 and then we fold a first time in 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.810
 triangle shape 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.140
 and then a second time on the edge 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.140
 opposite 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.030
 so we know a little bit about 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.780
 end we did that will hold on to call and 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.270
 the little taste of butter still 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.990
 exactly the glue it's going to be the butter 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:28.110
 okay we have a bib the leaf for the bow 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:30.560
 these are and installs like that in 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.560
 a dish 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.080
 then we'll just brown the 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.659
 baked samosas on one side and when 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:52.519
 see that the first side has colored on them 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:54.860
 returns to gild the second side and 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:57.950
 here we are at the ca so you can 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:01.280
 serve your samossa as input for example 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.660
 or in tapas mode or as an aperitif for 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.430
 that you can accompany them by 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.290
 example of a mango chutney or a 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.640
 slightly spicy tomato sauce or 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.640
 still a dash of lime
