ball of yarn or another color it works
the<00:00:27.990> same<00:00:28.199> way<00:00:28.439> you<00:00:28.890> can<00:00:29.070> do<00:00:29.189> this<00:00:29.369> in<00:00:29.580> rows<00:00:29.880> in

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
the same way you can do this in rows in

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.170 
the same way you can do this in rows in
rounds<00:00:31.109> any<00:00:31.349> time<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.219> want<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.940> throw<00:00:33.120> a

different color in there or run out of

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.380 
different color in there or run out of
yarn<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.340> need<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.730> join<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.870> next<00:00:37.260> Bowl<00:00:38.390> so

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.400 
the row or the round that you're working
on<00:00:44.160> so<00:00:44.820> here<00:00:45.120> I'm<00:00:45.329> working<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:45.780> rows<00:00:45.989> I'm<00:00:46.260> at

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
on so here I'm working in rows I'm at

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.100 
on so here I'm working in rows I'm at
the<00:00:46.559> end<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.980> my<00:00:47.160> row<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.670> I'm<00:00:48.239> ready<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.690> start

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
the end of my row and I'm ready to start

the end of my row and I'm ready to start
the<00:00:49.379> next<00:00:49.410> one<00:00:49.850> so<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:51.270> would<00:00:51.870> at<00:00:52.199> this<00:00:52.500> point

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
the next one so I would at this point

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.959 
the next one so I would at this point
make<00:00:53.550> my<00:00:53.760> chain<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.469> continue<00:00:55.469> turn<00:00:56.280> go<00:00:56.730> back

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
make my chain and continue turn go back

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.479 
make my chain and continue turn go back
for<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.300> next<00:00:57.570> row<00:00:57.780> but<00:00:58.530> where<00:00:58.770> I'm<00:00:58.920> going<00:00:59.250> to

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
for the next row but where I'm going to

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.569 
for the next row but where I'm going to
change<00:01:00.059> colors<00:01:00.510> now<00:01:00.750> just<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.350> show<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.680> how

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
change colors now just to show you how

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.219 
change colors now just to show you how
you<00:01:02.640> can<00:01:03.000> change<00:01:03.210> colors<00:01:03.660> using<00:01:04.110> this

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
you can change colors using this

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.070 
you can change colors using this
technique<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:05.040> make<00:01:05.189> stripes<00:01:05.519> but<00:01:06.299> if<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.750> are

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
technique to make stripes but if you are

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.050 
technique to make stripes but if you are
using<00:01:07.439> all<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.650> same<00:01:07.920> color<00:01:08.189> it's<00:01:08.549> exactly

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
using all the same color it's exactly

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.640 
using all the same color it's exactly
the<00:01:09.240> same<00:01:09.450> way<00:01:09.890> I'm<00:01:10.890> going<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.610> stop<00:01:12.420> before<00:01:13.080> I

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
the same way I'm going to stop before I

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.039 
the same way I'm going to stop before I
change<00:01:14.130> for<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.640> next<00:01:14.939> row<00:01:15.150> I'm<00:01:15.780> going<00:01:15.840> to

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
change for the next row I'm going to

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.499 
change for the next row I'm going to
take<00:01:16.200> my<00:01:16.350> new<00:01:16.500> color<00:01:16.799> here<00:01:16.890> or<00:01:17.430> another<00:01:18.000> ball

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
take my new color here or another ball

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.100 
take my new color here or another ball
of<00:01:18.540> yarn<00:01:18.830> whatever<00:01:19.830> you're<00:01:20.040> doing<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:21.150> I've

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
of yarn whatever you're doing and I've

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.070 
of yarn whatever you're doing and I've
stopped<00:01:22.650> just<00:01:23.220> before<00:01:23.820> I'm<00:01:24.150> making<00:01:24.630> my<00:01:24.780> chain

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
stopped just before I'm making my chain

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.719 
stopped just before I'm making my chain
to<00:01:25.350> go<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.979> next<00:01:26.159> round

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
to go to the next round

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.649 
to go to the next round
and<00:01:26.880> when<00:01:27.750> you're<00:01:28.369> looping<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:30.030> new<00:01:30.329> yarn

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
and when you're looping that new yarn

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.210 
and when you're looping that new yarn
around<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.990> hook<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.799> want<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.100> make<00:01:32.189> sure

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
around the hook you want to make sure

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.690 
around the hook you want to make sure
you're<00:01:32.610> leaving<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.210> nice<00:01:33.479> long<00:01:33.930> tail<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:35.040> the

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
you're leaving a nice long tail and the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.460 
you're leaving a nice long tail and the
reason<00:01:36.000> for<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.840> want<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.200> give

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
reason for that is you want to give

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.069 
reason for that is you want to give
yourself<00:01:37.799> enough<00:01:38.100> yarn<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:39.060> sew<00:01:39.090> back<00:01:39.630> into

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
yourself enough yarn to sew back into

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.600 
yourself enough yarn to sew back into
the<00:01:40.200> fabric<00:01:40.710> when<00:01:41.009> you're<00:01:41.159> done<00:01:41.369> with

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
the fabric when you're done with

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.420 
the fabric when you're done with
everything<00:01:42.229> so<00:01:43.229> I'm<00:01:43.350> going<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.649> pull<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.130> new

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
everything so I'm going to pull that new

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.149 
everything so I'm going to pull that new
yarn<00:01:45.090> through<00:01:46.220> to<00:01:47.220> make<00:01:47.399> my<00:01:47.610> turning<00:01:48.149> chain

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
yarn through to make my turning chain

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.819 
yarn through to make my turning chain
and<00:01:50.159> at<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.090> point<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.750> can<00:01:51.960> continue<00:01:52.649> on

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
and at this point you can continue on

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.710 
and at this point you can continue on
with<00:01:52.860> what<00:01:53.220> you're<00:01:53.340> doing<00:01:53.700> if<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.509> need<00:01:54.689> a

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
with what you're doing if you need a

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.899 
with what you're doing if you need a
longer<00:01:55.140> chain<00:01:55.409> for<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.890> taller<00:01:56.219> stitch<00:01:56.610> like

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
longer chain for a taller stitch like

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.280 
longer chain for a taller stitch like
the<00:01:57.030> double<00:01:57.329> crochet<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.750> would<00:01:57.960> continue

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
the double crochet you would continue

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.010 
the double crochet you would continue
chaining<00:01:58.799> with<00:01:58.979> your<00:01:59.130> new<00:01:59.310> yarn

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
chaining with your new yarn

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.290

or if you're working in rounds so in a

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.900 
or if you're working in rounds so in a
circle<00:02:04.810> you<00:02:05.080> would<00:02:05.200> just<00:02:05.380> keep<00:02:05.620> going<00:02:05.880> for<00:02:06.880> the

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
circle you would just keep going for the

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:07.800 
circle you would just keep going for the
next<00:02:07.000> round

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
next round

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.710 
next round
so<00:02:08.680> with<00:02:08.890> these<00:02:09.100> tails<00:02:09.550> at<00:02:09.910> the<00:02:10.210> end<00:02:10.390> of<00:02:10.600> your

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
so with these tails at the end of your

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.320 
so with these tails at the end of your
entire<00:02:11.110> project<00:02:11.530> what<00:02:12.400> you<00:02:12.520> need<00:02:12.700> to<00:02:12.850> do<00:02:13.060> is

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
entire project what you need to do is

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.660 
entire project what you need to do is
sew<00:02:13.990> them<00:02:14.200> back<00:02:14.230> into<00:02:14.710> the<00:02:15.010> fabric<00:02:15.490> just

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
sew them back into the fabric just

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.020 
sew them back into the fabric just
through<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.540> loops<00:02:16.780> on<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.140> stitches<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:18.030> if

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
through the loops on the stitches and if

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.090 
through the loops on the stitches and if
you're<00:02:19.240> using<00:02:19.450> different<00:02:19.750> colors<00:02:20.380> it's

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
you're using different colors it's

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.490 
you're using different colors it's
usually<00:02:21.370> a<00:02:21.580> good<00:02:21.760> idea<00:02:21.820> to<00:02:22.120> sew<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.230> tails

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
usually a good idea to sew the tails

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.160 
usually a good idea to sew the tails
back<00:02:23.890> into<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.520> fabric<00:02:24.970> in<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.600> same<00:02:25.840> color

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
back into the fabric in the same color

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.920 
back into the fabric in the same color
section<00:02:26.710> so<00:02:26.980> this<00:02:27.100> blue<00:02:27.490> tail<00:02:27.760> I<00:02:28.060> would<00:02:28.630> sew

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
section so this blue tail I would sew

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.040 
section so this blue tail I would sew
back<00:02:29.620> into<00:02:30.070> this<00:02:30.220> area<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:30.880> my<00:02:31.540> yellow<00:02:31.900> up

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
back into this area and my yellow up

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.320 
back into this area and my yellow up
here<00:02:32.350> I<00:02:32.530> would<00:02:33.040> sew<00:02:33.220> into<00:02:33.460> my<00:02:33.670> yellow<00:02:33.910> stripe

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
here I would sew into my yellow stripe

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.280 
here I would sew into my yellow stripe
and<00:02:34.600> that's<00:02:35.350> how<00:02:35.530> you<00:02:35.590> join<00:02:35.830> a<00:02:35.890> new<00:02:36.100> ball
