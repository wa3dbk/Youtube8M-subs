Ziggler and they ended either up in the

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.149 
Ziggler and they ended either up in the
rock<00:02:00.450> they<00:02:00.719> ended<00:02:00.990> up<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.439> know<00:02:01.469> getting<00:02:01.829> the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
shaft or they were just current jerk I'd

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.530 
shaft or they were just current jerk I'd
end<00:02:05.369> up<00:02:05.460> getting<00:02:05.700> jobbed<00:02:05.939> out<00:02:06.149> they<00:02:06.390> weren't

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
end up getting jobbed out they weren't

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.029 
end up getting jobbed out they weren't
utilized<00:02:06.990> correctly<00:02:07.439> weren't<00:02:07.740> put<00:02:07.890> in<00:02:07.979> the

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
utilized correctly weren't put in the

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.380 
utilized correctly weren't put in the
right<00:02:08.129> situation<00:02:08.759> wasn't<00:02:08.940> putting<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.300> right

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
right situation wasn't putting the right

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.660 
right situation wasn't putting the right
storyline<00:02:09.989> but<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.649> think<00:02:10.890> Ric<00:02:11.069> Flair<00:02:11.340> could<00:02:11.550> do

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
storyline but I think Ric Flair could do

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.460 
storyline but I think Ric Flair could do
wonders<00:02:11.910> for<00:02:12.060> both<00:02:12.330> Dolph<00:02:12.660> Ziggler<00:02:13.050> in<00:02:13.230> them

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
wonders for both Dolph Ziggler in them

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.590 
wonders for both Dolph Ziggler in them
is<00:02:13.560> at<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:13.920> same<00:02:14.160> time<00:02:14.520> that<00:02:15.210> would<00:02:15.360> probably

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
is at the same time that would probably

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.170 
is at the same time that would probably
be<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:15.900> good<00:02:16.050> way<00:02:16.380> to<00:02:16.410> restart<00:02:17.040> these<00:02:17.250> guys<00:02:17.520> you

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
be a good way to restart these guys you

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.420 
be a good way to restart these guys you
know<00:02:18.240> to<00:02:18.870> go<00:02:19.260> forward<00:02:19.740> sometimes<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.250> have<00:02:20.370> to

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
know to go forward sometimes you have to

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.280 
know to go forward sometimes you have to
take<00:02:20.460> two<00:02:20.790> steps<00:02:20.850> back<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.630> it<00:02:22.140> really

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
take two steps back and it really

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.870 
take two steps back and it really
wouldn't<00:02:22.620> be<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.740> step<00:02:23.040> back<00:02:23.250> because<00:02:23.400> Ric

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
wouldn't be a step back because Ric

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.610 
wouldn't be a step back because Ric
Flair<00:02:24.090> could<00:02:24.300> enhance<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.960> careers<00:02:25.410> of

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
Flair could enhance the careers of

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.730 
Flair could enhance the careers of
Ziggler<00:02:26.430> enemies<00:02:27.420> at<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.660> same<00:02:28.080> time<00:02:28.350> and<00:02:28.680> I

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
Ziggler enemies at the same time and I

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.190 
Ziggler enemies at the same time and I
think<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:29.340> bright<00:02:29.700> lights<00:02:30.030> could<00:02:30.540> be<00:02:30.720> on<00:02:30.900> them

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
think the bright lights could be on them

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.410 
think the bright lights could be on them
and<00:02:31.410> more<00:02:32.070> importance<00:02:32.610> would<00:02:32.730> be<00:02:32.880> shed<00:02:33.240> on

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
and more importance would be shed on

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.570 
and more importance would be shed on
Dolph<00:02:33.960> Ziggler<00:02:34.380> in<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.710> mists<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.130> they

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
Dolph Ziggler in the mists and they

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.250 
Dolph Ziggler in the mists and they
would<00:02:35.730> be<00:02:35.880> you<00:02:36.210> know<00:02:36.390> let<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.720> prominence

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
would be you know let the prominence

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.040 
would be you know let the prominence
once<00:02:37.470> again<00:02:37.800> and<00:02:38.010> maybe<00:02:38.760> this<00:02:39.150> time<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:39.930> know

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
once again and maybe this time you know

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.690 
once again and maybe this time you know
things<00:02:40.380> would<00:02:40.500> be<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:40.680> little<00:02:40.950> bit<00:02:41.220> different

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
things would be a little bit different

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.490 
things would be a little bit different
for<00:02:41.850> Ziggler<00:02:42.150> in<00:02:42.270> the<00:02:42.360> Miz<00:02:42.570> because<00:02:43.170> as<00:02:43.320> we<00:02:43.470> all

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
for Ziggler in the Miz because as we all

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.020 
for Ziggler in the Miz because as we all
know<00:02:43.770> sometimes<00:02:44.160> things<00:02:44.340> don't<00:02:44.550> pan<00:02:44.790> out<00:02:44.970> the

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
know sometimes things don't pan out the

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.270 
know sometimes things don't pan out the
way<00:02:45.210> you<00:02:45.390> expect<00:02:45.870> them<00:02:45.959> to<00:02:46.200> pan<00:02:46.380> out<00:02:46.560> but<00:02:46.800> I

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
way you expect them to pan out but I

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.310 
way you expect them to pan out but I
think<00:02:47.640> Ric<00:02:47.820> Flair<00:02:48.120> could<00:02:48.360> definitely<00:02:48.930> be

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
think Ric Flair could definitely be

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.070 
think Ric Flair could definitely be
exactly<00:02:50.010> what<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.850> miz<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.450> Ziggler<00:02:51.900> needs

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
exactly what the miz and Ziggler needs

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.860 
exactly what the miz and Ziggler needs
to<00:02:52.380> get<00:02:52.530> that<00:02:52.650> extra<00:02:52.920> push<00:02:53.310> so<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.180> speak<00:02:54.570> and

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
to get that extra push so to speak and

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.170 
to get that extra push so to speak and
to<00:02:55.860> be<00:02:55.980> recognized<00:02:56.490> because<00:02:56.670> there's<00:02:57.060> no

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
to be recognized because there's no

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.449 
to be recognized because there's no
doubt<00:02:57.390> that<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.690> miz<00:02:57.900> and<00:02:58.170> Ziggler<00:02:58.590> have<00:02:59.070> you

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
doubt that the miz and Ziggler have you

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.760 
doubt that the miz and Ziggler have you
know<00:02:59.580> hopefully<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.390> long<00:03:00.660> tenure<00:03:01.170> you<00:03:01.650> know

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
know hopefully a long tenure you know

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.650 
know hopefully a long tenure you know
ahead<00:03:01.920> of<00:03:02.070> them<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:02.459> uh<00:03:02.550> you<00:03:03.330> know<00:03:03.360> hopefully

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
ahead of them and uh you know hopefully

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.750 
ahead of them and uh you know hopefully
more<00:03:03.990> world<00:03:04.200> championships<00:03:04.709> in<00:03:04.890> their<00:03:05.580> future

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
more world championships in their future

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.760 
more world championships in their future
and<00:03:06.150> and<00:03:06.660> I<00:03:06.720> think<00:03:06.750> Ric<00:03:07.080> Flair<00:03:07.290> could<00:03:07.560> be<00:03:07.650> the

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
and and I think Ric Flair could be the

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.470 
and and I think Ric Flair could be the
answer<00:03:07.890> to<00:03:08.100> them<00:03:08.370> but<00:03:08.640> once<00:03:08.820> again<00:03:08.970> it's<00:03:09.270> about

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
answer to them but once again it's about

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.390 
answer to them but once again it's about
the<00:03:09.600> right<00:03:09.750> booking<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.440> you<00:03:11.070> know<00:03:11.160> I<00:03:11.190> know<00:03:11.310> a

the right booking and you know I know a

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.830 
the right booking and you know I know a
lot<00:03:11.580> of<00:03:11.640> people<00:03:11.730> don't<00:03:12.090> like<00:03:12.150> to<00:03:12.360> miss<00:03:12.570> you

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
lot of people don't like to miss you

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.420 
lot of people don't like to miss you
know<00:03:12.990> but<00:03:13.320> he's<00:03:13.440> arrogant<00:03:13.830> you<00:03:14.100> know<00:03:14.190> he's<00:03:14.310> got
