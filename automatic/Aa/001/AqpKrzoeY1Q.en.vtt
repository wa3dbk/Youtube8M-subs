everybody<00:00:03.210> asked<00:00:03.389> in<00:00:03.540> with<00:00:03.689> engadget<00:00:04.200> and

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
everybody asked in with engadget and

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.950 
everybody asked in with engadget and
this<00:00:04.470> is<00:00:04.830> the<00:00:05.190> new<00:00:05.370> iPad<00:00:05.879> no<00:00:06.120> fancy<00:00:06.509> name<00:00:06.720> no

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
this is the new iPad no fancy name no

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.100 
this is the new iPad no fancy name no
number<00:00:07.230> designation<00:00:08.130> just<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.700> new<00:00:08.849> iPad<00:00:09.360> it

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
number designation just the new iPad it

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.780 
number designation just the new iPad it
looks<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.380> lot<00:00:10.500> like<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.830> old<00:00:10.980> iPad<00:00:11.340> and<00:00:11.670> that

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
looks a lot like the old iPad and that

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.780 
looks a lot like the old iPad and that
is<00:00:11.969> by<00:00:12.210> design<00:00:12.240> if<00:00:12.840> we<00:00:12.960> flip<00:00:13.200> it<00:00:13.320> over<00:00:13.469> here<00:00:13.950> you

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
is by design if we flip it over here you

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.340 
is by design if we flip it over here you
can<00:00:14.940> see<00:00:15.089> that<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.389> looks<00:00:15.420> very<00:00:15.809> similar<00:00:16.020> it<00:00:16.230> is

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
can see that it looks very similar it is

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.109 
can see that it looks very similar it is
a<00:00:16.470> little<00:00:16.890> bit<00:00:17.100> thicker<00:00:17.369> though<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:17.820> little

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
a little bit thicker though a little

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.939 
a little bit thicker though a little
over<00:00:18.330> half<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.660> millimeter<00:00:19.050> thicker<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.650> the

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
over half a millimeter thicker and the

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.800 
over half a millimeter thicker and the
tapering<00:00:20.310> on<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.550> edges<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.180> bit<00:00:21.570> different

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
tapering on the edges is a bit different

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.990 
tapering on the edges is a bit different
but<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.230> basic<00:00:22.560> orientation<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.430> layout<00:00:23.820> is

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
but the basic orientation and layout is

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.150 
but the basic orientation and layout is
exactly<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.570> same<00:00:24.810> you<00:00:25.619> get<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.800> speaker

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
exactly the same you get the speaker

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.380 
exactly the same you get the speaker
pointing<00:00:26.609> on<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.820> back<00:00:26.970> here<00:00:27.000> which<00:00:27.300> is

new<00:00:36.480> bit<00:00:36.690> here<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.079> is<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.350> new<00:00:37.530> 5<00:00:37.800> megapixel

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
new bit here this is the new 5 megapixel

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.030 
new bit here this is the new 5 megapixel
camera<00:00:38.910> on<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.090> back<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:40.079> isight<00:00:40.559> camera<00:00:40.590> it

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
camera on the back the isight camera it

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.069 
camera on the back the isight camera it
is<00:00:41.070> very<00:00:41.430> similar<00:00:41.640> in<00:00:41.790> construction<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.870> that

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
is very similar in construction to that

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.069 
is very similar in construction to that
on<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.620> new<00:00:43.890> 4s<00:00:44.610> but<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.390> slightly<00:00:45.719> lower

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
on the new 4s but a slightly lower

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.680 
on the new 4s but a slightly lower
megapixel<00:00:46.950> count<00:00:47.100> 5<00:00:47.430> megapixels<00:00:48.059> vs<00:00:48.360> 8<00:00:48.510> but

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
megapixel count 5 megapixels vs 8 but

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.619 
megapixel count 5 megapixels vs 8 but
we've<00:00:48.809> got<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.020> same<00:00:49.200> five-element<00:00:50.190> lens

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
we've got the same five-element lens

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:52.970 
we've got the same five-element lens
construction<00:00:51.629> in<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.809> same<00:00:52.050> photo

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
construction in the same photo

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.580 
construction in the same photo
stabilization<00:00:53.699> we<00:00:53.820> found<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.329> be<00:00:54.590> pretty

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
stabilization we found it to be pretty

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.439 
stabilization we found it to be pretty
good<00:00:55.770> in<00:00:55.949> terms<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.340> picture<00:00:56.820> quality<00:00:56.850> of

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
good in terms of picture quality of

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.420 
good in terms of picture quality of
course<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.199> resolution<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.680> not<00:00:58.800> quite<00:00:59.160> the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
course the resolution is not quite the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.599 
course the resolution is not quite the
same<00:00:59.640> as<00:00:59.699> on<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.449> iphone<00:01:00.930> 4s<00:01:01.530> but<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.430> same

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
same as on the iphone 4s but the same

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.310 
same as on the iphone 4s but the same
responsiveness<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.390> roughly<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.110> same

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
responsiveness and roughly the same

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.649 
responsiveness and roughly the same
quality<00:01:05.100> in<00:01:05.369> pictures<00:01:05.790> as<00:01:06.119> we've<00:01:06.360> seen<00:01:06.510> on

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
quality in pictures as we've seen on

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.289 
quality in pictures as we've seen on
that<00:01:06.689> device<00:01:07.670> so<00:01:08.670> let's<00:01:08.790> give<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.060> quick

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
that device so let's give you a quick

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.969 
that device so let's give you a quick
demo<00:01:09.570> walkthrough<00:01:09.810> now<00:01:10.409> there<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.890> new

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
demo walkthrough now there is a new

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.070 
demo walkthrough now there is a new
processor<00:01:11.610> in<00:01:11.760> here<00:01:11.970> it's<00:01:12.060> called<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.390> 5<00:01:12.780> X

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
processor in here it's called the a 5 X

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.980 
processor in here it's called the a 5 X
which<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.530> quad-core<00:01:13.860> graphics<00:01:14.509> on<00:01:15.509> top<00:01:15.780> of

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
which is a quad-core graphics on top of

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.480 
which is a quad-core graphics on top of
a<00:01:16.080> dual-core<00:01:16.470> processor<00:01:16.920> but<00:01:17.130> it's<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.340> same

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
a dual-core processor but it's the same

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.469 
a dual-core processor but it's the same
CPU<00:01:18.030> effectively<00:01:18.630> as<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:19.110> in<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.560> ipad<00:01:20.159> 2<00:01:20.640> so

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
CPU effectively as is in the ipad 2 so

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.570 
CPU effectively as is in the ipad 2 so
launching<00:01:22.290> applications<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.100> doing<00:01:23.340> most

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
launching applications and doing most

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.340 
launching applications and doing most
journal<00:01:23.880> tasks<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.689> actually<00:01:25.020> no<00:01:25.110> quicker

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
journal tasks is actually no quicker

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.490 
journal tasks is actually no quicker
than<00:01:25.680> on<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.869> pre-existing<00:01:27.869> iPad<00:01:28.170> in<00:01:28.290> fact

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
than on the pre-existing iPad in fact

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.499 
than on the pre-existing iPad in fact
we're<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:28.799> some<00:01:28.950> benchmarks<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:30.270> they're

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
we're in some benchmarks and they're

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.690 
we're in some benchmarks and they're
effectively<00:01:30.930> clocking<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.920> same<00:01:32.159> scores

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
effectively clocking the same scores

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.399 
effectively clocking the same scores
however<00:01:33.150> one<00:01:33.479> thing<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.840> will<00:01:33.960> be<00:01:34.110> quite<00:01:34.320> a

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
however one thing that will be quite a

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.340 
however one thing that will be quite a
bit<00:01:34.590> quicker<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:35.329> the<00:01:36.329> download<00:01:36.780> speeds<00:01:37.110> this

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
bit quicker is the download speeds this

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.740 
bit quicker is the download speeds this
is<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.560> verizon<00:01:37.920> LTE<00:01:38.430> model<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.180> we're<00:01:39.600> going

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
is a verizon LTE model and we're going

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.060 
is a verizon LTE model and we're going
to<00:01:39.840> go<00:01:39.900> ahead<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.049> run<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.259> quick<00:01:40.500> speed<00:01:40.799> test

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
to go ahead and run a quick speed test

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.550 
to go ahead and run a quick speed test
so<00:01:41.549> we've<00:01:41.640> seen<00:01:41.880> speeds<00:01:42.240> typically<00:01:42.720> around<00:01:42.930> 23

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
so we've seen speeds typically around 23

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.100 
so we've seen speeds typically around 23
to<00:01:43.649> 24<00:01:44.070> megabits<00:01:44.549> per<00:01:44.670> second<00:01:45.090> down<00:01:45.270> usually

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
to 24 megabits per second down usually

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.319 
to 24 megabits per second down usually
around<00:01:46.200> 18<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.740> 20<00:01:47.100> up<00:01:47.250> let's<00:01:47.579> see<00:01:47.700> if<00:01:47.909> we<00:01:48.090> can

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
around 18 to 20 up let's see if we can

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.149 
around 18 to 20 up let's see if we can
get<00:01:48.689> there<00:01:48.930> even<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.229> little<00:01:49.320> bit<00:01:49.409> higher<00:01:49.619> 26

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
get there even a little bit higher 26

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.859 
get there even a little bit higher 26
down<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:51.799> 16.8<00:01:52.799> up<00:01:53.369> so<00:01:53.790> quite<00:01:54.090> respectful<00:01:54.540> for

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
down and 16.8 up so quite respectful for

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.569 
down and 16.8 up so quite respectful for
an<00:01:54.960> LTE<00:01:55.200> device<00:01:55.409> we're<00:01:55.619> also<00:01:55.770> in<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.310> middle

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
an LTE device we're also in the middle

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.120 
an LTE device we're also in the middle
of<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.759> big<00:01:56.939> building<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.540> that's<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.619> part<00:01:59.040> of

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
of a big building so that's a part of

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.539 
of a big building so that's a part of
the<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.509> speed<00:02:00.810> test<00:02:01.020> here<00:02:01.229> as<00:02:01.290> well<00:02:01.409> all<00:02:01.920> the

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
the the speed test here as well all the

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.340 
the the speed test here as well all the
native<00:02:02.939> apps<00:02:03.299> have<00:02:03.630> been<00:02:03.780> updated<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.259> support

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
native apps have been updated to support

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.700 
native apps have been updated to support
the<00:02:04.860> new<00:02:05.070> display<00:02:05.610> so<00:02:05.670> if<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.180> go<00:02:06.390> in<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:07.140> for

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
the new display so if you go in to for

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.119 
the new display so if you go in to for
example<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.340> Photos<00:02:08.729> app<00:02:09.470> we<00:02:10.470> will<00:02:10.619> get<00:02:10.830> much

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
example the Photos app we will get much

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.619 
example the Photos app we will get much
higher<00:02:11.280> resolution<00:02:11.790> rendering<00:02:12.270> than<00:02:12.450> before

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
higher resolution rendering than before

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.780 
higher resolution rendering than before
but<00:02:13.440> of<00:02:13.560> course<00:02:13.739> because<00:02:13.980> we<00:02:14.099> have<00:02:14.250> four<00:02:14.550> times

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
but of course because we have four times

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.130 
but of course because we have four times
as<00:02:14.910> many<00:02:15.000> pixels<00:02:15.150> you<00:02:15.599> can<00:02:15.720> see<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:15.840> lot<00:02:16.110> more

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
as many pixels you can see a lot more

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.320 
as many pixels you can see a lot more
detail<00:02:16.709> within<00:02:17.040> these<00:02:17.280> pictures<00:02:17.640> then<00:02:18.239> you

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
detail within these pictures then you

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.360 
detail within these pictures then you
can<00:02:18.450> see<00:02:18.569> before<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:19.050> can<00:02:19.200> pinch<00:02:19.470> in<00:02:19.770> you<00:02:20.220> can

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
can see before you can pinch in you can

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.670 
can see before you can pinch in you can
see<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:20.640> individual<00:02:21.000> hairs<00:02:21.239> on<00:02:21.480> my<00:02:22.470> dog's

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
see the individual hairs on my dog's

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.520 
see the individual hairs on my dog's
head<00:02:22.950> much<00:02:23.160> more<00:02:23.400> easily<00:02:23.580> than<00:02:23.790> before<00:02:24.530> can

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
head much more easily than before can

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.589 
head much more easily than before can
also<00:02:25.709> if<00:02:25.980> you<00:02:26.160> bring<00:02:26.459> up<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.670> website<00:02:26.879> there's<00:02:27.480> a

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
also if you bring up a website there's a

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.210 
also if you bring up a website there's a
lot<00:02:27.750> more<00:02:27.780> text<00:02:28.319> that<00:02:28.440> you<00:02:28.560> can<00:02:28.680> see<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.099> make

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
lot more text that you can see and make

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.890 
lot more text that you can see and make
up<00:02:29.370> very<00:02:29.550> easily<00:02:29.610> you<00:02:30.420> don't<00:02:30.599> need<00:02:30.720> to<00:02:30.810> be

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
up very easily you don't need to be

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.949 
up very easily you don't need to be
doing<00:02:30.989> as<00:02:31.230> much<00:02:31.349> pinch<00:02:31.680> zooming<00:02:32.129> as<00:02:32.310> before

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
doing as much pinch zooming as before

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.229 
doing as much pinch zooming as before
the<00:02:33.959> text<00:02:34.260> is<00:02:34.379> much<00:02:34.620> easier<00:02:34.830> to<00:02:35.099> read<00:02:35.459> and<00:02:35.640> it

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
the text is much easier to read and it

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.390 
the text is much easier to read and it
has<00:02:36.390> been<00:02:36.629> but<00:02:37.080> ultimately<00:02:37.530> browsing<00:02:38.069> itself

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
has been but ultimately browsing itself

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.250 
has been but ultimately browsing itself
is<00:02:38.550> not<00:02:38.730> any<00:02:38.910> quicker<00:02:39.209> but<00:02:39.870> then<00:02:40.050> it<00:02:40.170> was

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
is not any quicker but then it was

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.809 
is not any quicker but then it was
before<00:02:40.500> so<00:02:41.129> if<00:02:41.190> you're<00:02:41.280> hoping<00:02:41.430> for<00:02:41.489> an

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
before so if you're hoping for an

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.759 
before so if you're hoping for an
improvement<00:02:42.120> there<00:02:42.420> you're<00:02:43.319> not<00:02:43.470> going<00:02:43.709> to

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
improvement there you're not going to

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.710 
improvement there you're not going to
get<00:02:43.890> another<00:02:44.370> new<00:02:44.489> feature<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:45.540> voice

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
get another new feature the voice

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.270 
get another new feature the voice
recognition<00:02:45.959> we<00:02:46.500> can<00:02:46.620> go<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.860> Notes<00:02:47.099> app

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
recognition we can go to the Notes app

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.059 
recognition we can go to the Notes app
here<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:47.910> create<00:02:48.750> a<00:02:48.780> new<00:02:49.019> note<00:02:49.319> you<00:02:49.800> can<00:02:49.860> see

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
here and create a new note you can see

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.890 
here and create a new note you can see
the<00:02:50.250> lower<00:02:50.550> left<00:02:50.879> there's<00:02:51.150> this<00:02:51.390> new

know<00:03:31.060> when<00:03:31.239> Apple<00:03:31.599> is<00:03:31.660> going<00:03:31.690> to<00:03:31.900> bring<00:03:32.080> that

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
know when Apple is going to bring that

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.949 
know when Apple is going to bring that
to<00:03:32.349> devices<00:03:32.769> other<00:03:32.920> than<00:03:33.130> the<00:03:33.220> iphone<00:03:33.550> 4s<00:03:34.000> but

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
to devices other than the iphone 4s but

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.780 
to devices other than the iphone 4s but
it's<00:03:35.380> not<00:03:35.440> coming<00:03:35.709> to<00:03:35.830> the<00:03:35.860> ipad<00:03:36.130> now<00:03:36.370> anyway

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
it's not coming to the ipad now anyway

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.690

the resolution slightly faster processor

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:43.500 
the resolution slightly faster processor
