00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 good evening to all the boys I am 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.299
 promised and this even if only the 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.929
 second gameplay of black ops two already mi 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.849
 leads to breaking your cock with flaws 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:14.880
 that the faults have broken my cock 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.770
 this game clearly is the first one that 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.220
 the first who comes to mind comes to mind 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.260
 mind is nothing less populated than 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.840
 the effectiveness of the rewards on black 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.420
 ops 2 and likes the rewards of wim 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.099
 Gianni I was complaining about modern warfare 3 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.040
 ter who does not think assault on the occasion 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.840
 in this case we talk a bit about all of them 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.250
 all the rewards say why 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.010
 because there is no distinction between a 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.780
 think jump support other however 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.420
 clearly not all of them playout 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.030
 two fucked my dick though 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.700
 a good part we want to talk for 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.370
 example of how the rsto missile works 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.440
 of how the attacks work 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.050
 fulminating of the enemies we want to talk 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.280
 the effectiveness of dogs or dogs 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.320
 swarm of attack drones that have already 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.480
 understand what I'm talking about 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.570
 I'm talking about the fact that in black ops 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.110
 two there is absolutely no escape 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.810
 from the rewards kills and this is a 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.909
 first defect of game 1 design where 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.280
 it is an acceptable superable defect 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.439
 because there are a bonus shack of 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.130
 because you can use to avoid 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.680
 these things no no it's not because you 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.159
 try using the beautiful bonuses 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.130
 anti rewards invisible blood type 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.829
 cold that wi fi munawar what 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.250
 a this or that 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.810
 here these will provide you with let's say a 50 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.880
 percent more than surviving a 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.130
 attack because of a lightning attack 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.979
 randomly shot on the map or from a 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.890
 air storm missile and throw six rockets 78 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:53.430
 There is no 10 on half of the game map 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.619
 no way out guys try if 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.700
 do not believe it and you still have some 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.530
 doubt try it 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.899
 because I created classes for myself 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.729
 on purpose to have no breakages of 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.070
 balls in this sense with all the 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.979
 appropriate bonus and no way out 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.649
 every 2 rewards kills of this 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.020
 they still showed me the only one 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.970
 there is no escape with the attack drone 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.980
 he won't be looking for you at 10 kilometers 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.920
 away for the rest a mister el 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.930
 storm a lightning attack or the like 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.760
 vi.ma heal the same this does not do 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.700
 enough balls because practically 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.560
 in this way the game provides you 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.350
 no weapons against enemies 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.240
 they can defend and this is nice but 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.940
 look at it from the point of view of 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.220
 enemy that often the enemy is you and 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.710
 in this case it is not so beautiful 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.380
 get masarati gradually and maybe 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.930
 continuously because v. launch a 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.900
 lightning attack and you were dead 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.580
 from the usual killings of enemies without 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.470
 to be able to do nothing clearly because if 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.420
 you could do something would be all 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.720
 no other music without being able to do anything 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.150
 this is certainly the first defect 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.340
 really big is that you see immediately 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.260
 black ops 2 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.790
 second major flaw that I am i 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.100
 faults of black ops two are few 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.340
 maybe to better things than the 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.590
 3 but the defects are fairly large 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.650
 the second major flaw is that they are there 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.350
 a shack one teased places where there 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.980
 you can hide it is called a spot for 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:26.190
 example garbage cans barrels 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.170
 ask yourself who practically provides you with one 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.730
 total defense over who you have 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.490
 front even respects that you have in 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.980
 forehead if not for the head but how 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.690
 you'll know i think it's a decent place 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.400
 hard to hit 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.900
 it is true that he caught the head 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.260
 slaughtering ground in one shot two at the 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.570
 enemy 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.430
 but I want to see you to catch him in 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:48.270
 head when he available all the 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:50.370
 your body to hit you the defect not 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.590
 is so much in the fact that these points there 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.580
 be it because there were some in all 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.320
 colors 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.330
 the flaw of black ops two is set 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.670
 in the fact that these points are in 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.080
 excessive number compared to what 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.310
 it should 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.800
 this especially for a player 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.090
 novice really leads to not 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.970
 so much to sample because they are never 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.040
 built in camper areas leads to 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.320
 shelter for fear of being killed 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.510
 behind these points in an excessive way 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.430
 see the games especially the technicians 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.890
 or confirmed killings in which 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.299
 goal of both players and a team is 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:25.020
 of the other are behind these commercials 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:26.030
 behind these barrels cans crates walls 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.160
 put 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.770
 strange in a really excessive way that is 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.760
 this vis favors excessively and is 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.760
 that of the captains 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.100
 I challenge you to try and let me know how 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.660
 goes already know that it is so because if I am 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.570
 saying is because I have tried several 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.430
 times and if I tell you that this is a 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.270
 block ii defect you will realize 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.860
 bill 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.380
 I think it's a defect that will go away 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.210
 away however improving because people 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.490
 especially those a little more skilled yes 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.710
 they will easily break balls of being 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.720
 five minutes behind a caisson 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.600
 trash to shoot enemies while 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.430
 instead they will hopefully at least go 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.290
 a little around the map to try to 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.660
 do what the mode they are 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:08.210
 playing requires kind to conquer the 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.669
 platelets or enemy points compared to 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.830
 look for three easy killings to make us 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:14.680
 the greenhouses and killings of him before I already have 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.210
 said last two negative aspects 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.500
 fast enough for that at least 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.100
 what I could see now is 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.729
 surely the cinema of black ops ii e 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:27.200
 iii respon the cinema what I mean 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:29.150
 simply because it doesn't work 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.250
 the first twenty games I played are 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:34.700
 every two minutes were recorded e 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:36.919
 half a minute and 53 minutes and 40 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.990
 I don't know what is due but it is a beautiful one 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:40.880
 break of balls because different 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.140
 I would have liked to use different had 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.479
 going to talk in a certain 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.430
 and instead there was no verse 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:48.380
 they all came two minutes long two 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.270
 minutes and a half parts and not me 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.760
 interested and okay here he is 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.930
 probably a technical flaw that 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.430
 will be solved 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.050
 the fact is that when I bought the 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.750
 my sixty are paying for it 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:02.030
 eurini was in these last conditions 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:05.169
 man you are respon of this there is little to 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:09.530
 say but what most scandalous I believe of 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:10.280
 worship and pretends to be well done because 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.680
 really 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.229
 last night I played a game that didn't 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.250
 I had time to record insert 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:19.340
 in this video 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:22.340
 but damn bitch I got it twice 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:25.100
 reborn in front of me free road 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:27.380
 reborn in front of the enemies and have me 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:30.410
 clearly killed but perhaps only 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:32.360
 beautiful, that is, their own responses made at random 

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:34.790
 I like playing domain 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.110
 the response is not totally random 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.150
 every time you pull a 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.490
 supply and kill not 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.750
 matter if you have the flag in 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.370
 question where you pulled 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.050
 the supply network is born 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.480
 exactly on the other side of the map 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.380
 this is an advantage because 

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:51.260
 you will easily conquer the other 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:53.000
 flag but to say that every case of 

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.370
 once the supplies 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.980
 other thing is when you play death 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:01.060
 match reborn you half the time 

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:02.570
 in points in the middle of the map then 

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:05.870
 get close to the enemies 

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:08.450
 and at least I'll be dark, I'm reborn 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:10.460
 always before an enemy I turn you from 

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:12.860
 shoulders in front of the enemy that I am not 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.900
 pencil for example that was born a 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.270
 emilio turned of ass in front of me and it 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:19.310
 could kill us in mind there would be 

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:21.500
 a million examples to do but you have 

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:23.420
 well understood what i'm talking about 

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:26.270
 and the juice is always the usual the 

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:28.490
 response no you ass with you where 

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.860
 died fears the reborn net in one place 

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:32.900
 of shit or with the enemy attacked or in 

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:35.720
 in the middle of the map this in my opinion is 

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:38.300
 really one of those things that it would be 

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:41.180
 solvable by simply doing good 

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:44.180
 the game has been careful nuts because it is 

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:45.380
 all programming I think and even though 

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.390
 I'm not familiar to 

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:49.580
 there have always been good days with bei 

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:52.100
 response I don't understand why a call of 

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:54.920
 duty which is the game you should sell 

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:57.230
 more in the calendar year should have 

00:07:54.920 --> 00:08:00.260
 these bullshit bullshit as these
