00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 so let's sequence and do the 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.850
 the last settings in this bar that 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.680
 where are the issues pulled from the 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.599
 database and I also heard that it gave a 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.160
 zebra here with this right column 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.660
 that she is no longer right 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.880
 so let's go one thing at a time 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.680
 first let's put the date here 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.240
 today is to always be showing gas 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.609
 instead of being of all through a 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.920
 php function that I taught in course and hp and 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.800
 improve a little here is very 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.769
 complicated to understand this edition was the 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.539
 where it is written there edition and 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.940
 This is what we will do, what would it be? 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.670
 these fields here 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.250
 we will do the following between date 1 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.940
 and date two'll put here O attachment 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:46.219
 would be of age of certain date 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.899
 the taubatÃ© and here I am going to put period 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:51.360
 How long can I apply stringhi here? 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.190
 post-peak I can apply because I 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.500
 I can because I have the quotes here 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.360
 doubles before then he understands the boos 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.340
 so many variables that come with dollar sign 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.469
 As for the string, it can already 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.739
 differentiate it there to give a period 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.720
 59 2012 to what would then be the time that 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.720
 that issue would be this business of 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.820
 year one is and there as it comes here 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.670
 direct database I would have to 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.770
 edit then edit what rapidion that 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.729
 I thought I would just put the goal but it 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:25.229
 kind of weird that editing there a year 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.720
 of 2012 ok I'll have them run already 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.240
 automatically updates me here at 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.579
 my great portal and here I want him 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.439
 show the date today so if I want 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.650
 Today's date I'm going to use one 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.090
 Here native function of PHP that dent that 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.200
 I have already shown that it is very easy where 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:47.399
 you have to monitor your replacement by echo 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.770
 opa the father dies where the php block in 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.320
 php function then I need to open the 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.369
 block php now yes it will work then 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:59.220
 echo and I put here and today is not there I 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.319
 I can pull my variable I'm going to put 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.539
 here the point to concatenate context 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:06.289
 nor do I need it to remember that 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.849
 concatenated php the point that I place from 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:11.340
 o &amp; m there are even some rules or 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.860
 when you want two digits 400 and 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.380
 put only oy tiny will come only 12 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.420
 in the end I capitalized in 2002 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.970
 then watch a php course who has 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.950
 difficulty there will see these rules 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.500
 for dates all here is not the case here 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.660
 I 'm just creating and doing is like 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.989
 I explained it in an easier way. 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.370
 today is and has here is my my the 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.810
 my date but because it was very 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.250
 Coladinho here I can see the same 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.970
 thing I did here to rule out a 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.849
 bit right 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.760
 So let's do it so I have here the 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.620
 my class my spam or even copy that 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.510
 to streamline the page 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.810
 So I'm going to put a stage or put 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:52.970
 the stadium could already leave this with 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:58.380
 alignment to the left even 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:00.600
 control left if I do not put it back 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.790
 it is already on the left and the page here is not 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.489
 is the parent of ryder a spacing in the 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.650
 even left can be 10 pixels 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.060
 also so that it is the same as the other 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.000
 so look there 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.800
 cool that he's set but he is 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.740
 just this 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:20.310
 it is generally spaced because 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:25.080
 because it gave this spacing in general 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.940
 here in my spam or doing 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.900
 different let me take this one 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.600
 spacing here 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.730
 ah 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.730
 clicking where you should not here 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:45.000
 let me take it against the 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:47.100
 It's twelve o'clock. He came back. He disappeared. 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.390
 with my other date that was some 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:53.220
 thing that I did not apply here is 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:57.330
 he 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.280
 is missing quotation marks against the 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:03.570
 missing race indeed enough for you 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:06.600
 give zebra everything ok he left what he is 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.130
 doing here what is hurting not 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.380
 is the spacing that remains the same 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.690
 thing then ecoflores do not 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.460
 necessarily here I'm going to need the 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:20.209
 flow then I'll do the following I'll go 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:20.209
 let the stae led to use only op 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.170
 the only thing I really wanted 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.660
 he is already on the left so he does not 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:32.520
 is receiving that parameter 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:33.180
 he found s f5 ok he's back then it's him 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.730
 same 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:42.580
 only here is not page enright so 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:45.529
 he has not changed, but left against s 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:48.139
 Five great so that's what I wanted 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:49.819
 Look at the spacing here for 10 pixel not 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.830
 I can send him to the left in this 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:54.110
 column is only getting worse the situation 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.669
 She has to stay in here but she 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.099
 You're staying here because she's inside. 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:01.189
 of this content debt was then a 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:03.139
 My error is there, start structuring 

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:05.060
 I'll look for her, divide the right column. 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:06.439
 or 1 x against it 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.419
 remembering that my content is only 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:11.029
 ends before the footer we set 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:12.560
 This at first I must have here 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:14.539
 so at the end of my content 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.279
 I can send you here and he 'll come 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:18.169
 stay right because they go against 

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:21.289
 west to save our style here 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:24.439
 we have a flute that he already came 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:27.650
 right f5 opa has already been in the right place 

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:31.819
 It's very close up here on mine. 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:34.009
 from my other flap I can give a 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:35.599
 spacing for he left 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:37.419
 enjoy that I 'm here let me see 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:40.189
 I remember the time lost here to copy 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:42.589
 copy the father that his removal 

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:45.620
 ask for the top 

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:47.839
 then from the top it will give a 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:52.909
 ask for a top number how many pix 

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:54.860
 Let's see if this good against the s5 opa 

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:58.159
 He has already left but has a color of 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:00.529
 background there, what you are is harming 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:03.840
 it cds and I can also work with 

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:06.780
 top margin 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:11.310
 the 10 pixels also have margin for it 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:13.500
 As long as the 5 opa suffice then he 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.300
 gave a spacing up here in the text 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.520
 is that the distance but how it had run 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.650
 continued in the same way there is not only 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.840
 text to text would be only the 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.880
 Tiny as it is for the whole area I've had 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.370
 what to do with the margin was much more 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:28.350
 structured it then to finalize this 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:32.419
 class over here after we give sequence 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.419
 the other is continuing the site
