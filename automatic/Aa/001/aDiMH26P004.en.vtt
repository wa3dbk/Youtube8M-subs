to<00:01:24.000> be<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.240> good<00:01:24.390> but<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.900> know<00:01:25.020> we<00:01:25.200> got<00:01:25.320> our

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
to be that good but you know we got our

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.230 
to be that good but you know we got our
teammates<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.460> coaching<00:01:26.759> staff<00:01:26.939> we<00:01:27.090> got<00:01:27.210> a

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
teammates and a coaching staff we got a

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.999 
teammates and a coaching staff we got a
good<00:01:27.390> focus<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.810> have<00:01:27.930> machine<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.740> think<00:01:28.860> we

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
good focus to have machine so I think we

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:29.929 
good focus to have machine so I think we
can<00:01:29.130> be<00:01:29.189> pretty<00:01:29.400> good<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.700> better<00:01:29.820> than

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939
