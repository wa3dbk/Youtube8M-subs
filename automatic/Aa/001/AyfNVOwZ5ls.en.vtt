00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 hello everyone is because we 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:05.279
 the video site test.com today I 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.560
 presents you with the protein test 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.410
 mike brown rice protein a protein 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.800
 concentrated to 80% and constituting 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.540
 Mark 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.700
 the ideal protein for intolerants 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.700
 and vegetarians go it's gone 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.850
 so here we are in the presence of a 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.220
 vegetable protein a knowledge of 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.440
 rice arm the book to use our 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.900
 transgenic and constitutes the only 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.830
 ingredients of this protein like us 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.000
 explain the brand 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.770
 this protein is produced by 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.020
 different fermentation stages 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.850
 filtration and treatments ima tic so 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.400
 to extract the protein and fiber from 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.500
 brown rice sprouted brown rice used as 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.430
 basis of the process is not matters 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.430
 first production 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.460
 moreover rice has the advantage of being a 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.930
 gluten-free cereal this protein does not 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.640
 also contains no lactose and 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.610
 extend plant sources therefore suits 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.200
 intolerant and vegan 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.850
 level of effects I found two 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.280
 studies whose link is in 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.110
 the first article concluding that the 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.970
 effects of rice protein would be 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.410
 comparable to the effects of the wii with 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.880
 still a slight advantage for 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.190
 the latter at the level of the 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.930
 performance and the second that puts in 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.310
 evidence a superior action by 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.390
 report to the web for the loss of 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:26.020
 fat at the level of the composition for 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.659
 30 grams including 1 24 grams of protein 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:33.290
 3 grams of carbohydrates and 0.3 grams of 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:35.299
 fat compared to the web rate 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.520
 of protein at 4% and average 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.080
 we all have low lipids but 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.409
 on the other hand a carbohydrate rate a little 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.869
 thicker about the used them 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:48.500
 advisers to mix in the shaker 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.750
 between 150 and 250 milliliters of water at 30 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.630
 g of protein to use two or three 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.869
 times a day where as needed 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:59.470
 here I have 150 milliliters of water and 30 g 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.470
 protein powder 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.810
 so I poured in a glass for 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.400
 that we see well so it's still 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.150
 a little bit of moss that seems pretty 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:14.000
 quickly at the level of lumps it 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.530
 nothing left either in the grid or 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.350
 in shaker russia stays a little us 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.600
 do not go out too much but there is nothing left 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.880
 and we have a pretty floury texture is 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.500
 thick enough so to conclude in 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.330
 strong point we find a good 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.490
 visibility 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.200
 a complete rice without ogm a 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.360
 protein concentration in the average 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.190
 a low lipid level is a 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.350
 protein usable by the intolerant 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.290
 lactose and gluten and the 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.660
 vegans in weak point found 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.340
 a carbohydrate rate a bit high and a 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.150
 slightly lower efficiency by 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.550
 relation to the milk protein concerning 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.200
 my personal opinion therefore in the facts 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.300
 we see that the brown rice protein 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.610
 seems to be the ideal alternative to 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.360
 animal protein 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.100
 however, it is necessary 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.260
 some details about the studies 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.880
 first of all the first study was 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.500
 tested with both the protein isolate of 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.170
 rice while we are here in 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.550
 presence of focus and more he 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.530
 is not found fat loss 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.810
 superior unlike the second 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.180
 study done on kidneys 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.460
 regarding visibility it is rather 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.830
 good by cons we have a texture enough 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:21.640
 thick and grainy that can hinder 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:25.030
 some for the taste me I cut it 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.010
 with sugar to each other and as to the 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.260
 digestibility I have not encountered any 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.840
 problem I prices around 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.320
 snack training between 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.610
 meal and I had no problem so here we go 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.900
 I thank you for watching this 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.550
 video I tell you very soon on 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.550
 video test.com hi
