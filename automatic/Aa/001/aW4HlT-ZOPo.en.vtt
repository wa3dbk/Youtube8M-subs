00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
got the clean channel first this is the

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.220 
got the clean channel first this is the
the<00:02:19.040> black<00:02:19.280> style<00:02:19.519> boutique<00:02:19.970> clean<00:02:20.239> again

Oh

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.690 

we<00:02:43.540> move<00:02:43.780> across<00:02:43.900> at<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:44.170> drive<00:02:44.410> channel<00:02:44.830> the

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
we move across at the drive channel the

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.320 
we move across at the drive channel the
overdrive<00:02:46.240> channel<00:02:46.270> on<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.750> 20<00:02:47.440> is<00:02:47.650> a<00:02:48.270> kind<00:02:49.270> of

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
overdrive channel on the 20 is a kind of

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.480 
overdrive channel on the 20 is a kind of
a<00:02:49.390> higher<00:02:49.569> gain<00:02:49.840> modern<00:02:50.350> voicing<00:02:50.830> so<00:02:51.340> I'm

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
a higher gain modern voicing so I'm

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
that's it it's high as gainsaying but

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.140 
that's it it's high as gainsaying but
let's<00:03:12.350> take<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.070> game<00:03:13.250> right<00:03:13.490> down<00:03:13.760> it's<00:03:14.030> a
