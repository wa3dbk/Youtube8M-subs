00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.610 
our water supply what the heck is in our

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.089 
our water supply what the heck is in our
oxygen<00:00:25.450> supply<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:27.250> the<00:00:28.060> metallic<00:00:28.930> oxides

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
oxygen supply of the metallic oxides

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.240 
oxygen supply of the metallic oxides
salts<00:00:30.099> that<00:00:30.939> create<00:00:31.450> a<00:00:31.779> rainbow<00:00:32.379> effect<00:00:32.559> in<00:00:33.100> a

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
salts that create a rainbow effect in a

salts that create a rainbow effect in a
sprinkler<00:00:34.590> what<00:00:35.590> is<00:00:35.739> oozing<00:00:36.190> out<00:00:36.340> of<00:00:36.550> our

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
sprinkler what is oozing out of our

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.530 
sprinkler what is oozing out of our
ground<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:38.860> allows<00:00:39.250> this<00:00:39.580> type<00:00:39.850> of<00:00:39.910> effect

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
ground that allows this type of effect

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.009 
ground that allows this type of effect
to<00:00:40.629> happen<00:00:41.610> not<00:00:42.610> just<00:00:42.970> around<00:00:43.210> our<00:00:43.420> Sun<00:00:43.780> and

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:44.019 
to happen not just around our Sun and

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:48.970 
to happen not just around our Sun and
our<00:00:44.140> Moon<00:00:44.199> anymore<00:00:45.390> everywhere<00:00:46.390> we<00:00:46.570> look

the visible spectrum
is<00:00:52.320> rainbows<00:00:53.790> this<00:00:54.790> cannot<00:00:55.180> be<00:00:55.450> natural<00:00:56.370> we
