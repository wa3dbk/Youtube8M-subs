00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
can tell that it's like it's kind of

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.030 
can tell that it's like it's kind of
like<00:04:40.510> when<00:04:40.690> your<00:04:40.840> printer<00:04:41.020> gets<00:04:41.500> a<00:04:41.620> little<00:04:41.800> low

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
like when your printer gets a little low

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.780 
like when your printer gets a little low
on<00:04:42.070> ink<00:04:42.460> and<00:04:42.790> it's<00:04:42.940> kind<00:04:43.210> of<00:04:43.360> scratchy<00:04:44.790> but

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
on ink and it's kind of scratchy but

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:52.470 
on ink and it's kind of scratchy but
from<00:04:46.480> far<00:04:46.960> away<00:04:47.080> it<00:04:47.740> looks<00:04:47.970> totally<00:04:48.970> fine<00:04:51.480> it's

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
from far away it looks totally fine it's

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.880 
from far away it looks totally fine it's
just<00:04:52.810> when<00:04:53.020> you<00:04:53.110> look<00:04:53.260> at<00:04:53.380> your<00:04:53.500> nails<00:04:53.650> up
