this<00:00:05.440> special<00:00:05.830> point<00:00:06.040> we<00:00:06.310> will<00:00:06.460> call<00:00:06.670> the

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:06.790 
this special point we will call the

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.730 
this special point we will call the
origin<00:00:07.240> since<00:00:07.660> it<00:00:07.810> is<00:00:07.930> the<00:00:08.080> point<00:00:08.290> from<00:00:08.559> which

then seven points up we reach a point

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.970 
then seven points up we reach a point
