 then we are going to exercise 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.350
 knowing that we were turning in only three 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.320
 days the first the last 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.810
 and all of the middle and then that 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:44.009

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.569
 when she is tired 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.390
 the woman is the best of all 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:16.290
 excuses 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.790
 tomorrow we are not in the gym there is a path 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.360
 blonde with some balls she has are not 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.850
 clear 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.180
 to study this control before there was something 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.590
 that I am in the following and there 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.940
 It is when all the saints before 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.340
 Call you to invite you to eat at 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.860
 restaurant that you like then 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.240
 you arrive at your house with competing hampl 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.410
 with palitroque in that who said that 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.410
 has the sausage 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.240
 and this goes for all women and 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.740
 because when others are on diets 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.209
 we have to put ourselves on diets 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.990
 but when we are the ones who 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.990
 we are on diet 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.819

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.200

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.060

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.950

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:24.019

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.000

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.590
