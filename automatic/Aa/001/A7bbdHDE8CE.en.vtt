00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:29.150
 recent every new york this is 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.970
 and we have the city at our feet 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.580
 newly arrived and before going to the 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.410
 hotel that will go out and run a little and 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.510
 going out to burn was the one I will not go through with 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.830
 hotel I will not comment on a shower when I 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.260
 ask for a bathtub and the ones that come out 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.960
 You know me but it's time to go run a 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.750
 little I think I think cities do not 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.000
 are its buildings or its skyscrapers 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.070
 both the most iconic cities 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.650
 they are not even their dawns or their 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.140
 parks or its bridges by pretty for 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.059
 long or as spectacular as the 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.680
 cities are not their people the 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.899
 cities are not their facades are 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.670
 their flags or their rivers or their seas and 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.070
 its walls although sometimes these walls 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.869
 be it painted walls or walls that 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.330
 they talk or shout more than their politicians 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.770
 the cities the cities are not 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.590
 even the streets that you see from the 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.720
 taxi window or from the top of 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.450
 a building that challenges the sky or the 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.759
 asphalt and the sidewalks that you tread good that 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.289
 floor while you run for them from a 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.810
 street for another from one place to another 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:29.600
 from one monument to another the cities 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.060
 they are good that I think what we 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.590
 remember what we have lived in them 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.350
 so they project us into the distance 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.039
 not six years ago of the first 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.750
 time I came to new york that was the 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.909
 surely the first big trip of my 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.740
 life and it was just three weeks after 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.539
 bury my mother and the first thing that 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.270
 I did when I got there was running for this 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.009
 bridge and just because of this I have come without 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.799
 go through the hotel and do nothing else 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.539
 today to the brooklyn bridge to run alone 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.759
 before curling in new york one of my 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.130
 best friends is Carlos last with the 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.959
 Well, well, with which we have many 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.640
 things that unite us and others surely 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:09.209
 that separate us what they do to us 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.250
 different but above all we have 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.810
 one thing that makes us brothers his mother 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.120
 he also died of cancer 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.209
 his ashes are in the central park in 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.310
 the bridge of a small lake and still 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.560
 He has never come to visit since 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.200
 I met Carlos who speaks to me ago 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.360
 years since we are really 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.640
 doing old since since I met 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.710
 Charles 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.600
 and he talks to me about good and always puts me on 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.430
 example of an American monologist and 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.400
 one of its most typical expressions 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.500
 it says yucca he took place abdomen one 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.540
 he has to do what he has to do 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.760
 do there are cities to which to which 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.470
 you have to travel there are bridges that you have 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.570
 to cross there are dreams that must 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.880
 pursue there are people al sanaa more than 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.380
 which you have to take care of sure 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.480
 you have your lists very clear but 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.940
 with having the list is not enough you have to 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.069
 get out there and then that give 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.260
 candela to the subject I tomorrow what I have 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.330
 what to do is stop me from beautiful videos and 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.370
 hosts of these and go to central park to 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.650
 visit his mother while visiting 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.959
 can remember mine walk between the 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.330
 snow until I located where it is at 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.160
 side search among the trees until 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.260
 find where the bridge is and 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.720
 remind myself that we run but 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.790
 we did not see and remind Carlos that 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.070
 we run but we do not forget you 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.320
 I do not know why you run or for whom 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.420
 you run or what is your city ​​and what 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.340
 means for you neither what you have 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.560
 in the list of pending but in case 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:34.090
 Maybe it's better to start giving fire to the 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.090
 subject when the video ends
