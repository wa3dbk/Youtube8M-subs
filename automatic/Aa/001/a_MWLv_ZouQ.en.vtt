I'll squish them down and then what
we'll<00:01:04.409> see<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.799> what<00:01:05.519> we'll<00:01:05.640> get<00:01:05.820> out<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.000> it

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
we'll see is what we'll get out of it

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.390 
we'll see is what we'll get out of it
now<00:01:06.630> what<00:01:07.200> I'm<00:01:07.290> going<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.590> also<00:01:07.740> show<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.130> is

if I take this off of here when it's
potentially<00:01:11.220> full<00:01:12.260> what<00:01:13.260> I've<00:01:13.380> got<00:01:13.560> here<00:01:13.830> is

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010

potentially full what I've got here is
you<00:01:14.220> can<00:01:14.369> see<00:01:14.400> all<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.909> holes<00:01:15.119> in<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.659> actual

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
you can see all the holes in the actual

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.149 
you can see all the holes in the actual
board<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.759> then<00:01:18.150> when<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.330> flip<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:18.810> over<00:01:19.159> you

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
board and then when I flip this over you

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.890 
board and then when I flip this over you
see<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.520> put<00:01:20.580> these<00:01:20.909> two<00:01:21.180> little<00:01:21.450> slits<00:01:21.630> on

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
see that I put these two little slits on

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.230 
see that I put these two little slits on
here<00:01:22.409> well<00:01:23.130> that's<00:01:23.340> gonna<00:01:23.520> end<00:01:23.700> up<00:01:23.759> doing<00:01:23.939> is

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
here well that's gonna end up doing is

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.390 
here well that's gonna end up doing is
I'll<00:01:24.390> flip<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.689> over<00:01:24.810> like<00:01:25.020> this<00:01:25.080> I'll<00:01:25.920> put<00:01:26.280> it

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
I'll flip it over like this I'll put it

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.170 
I'll flip it over like this I'll put it
on<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.670> board<00:01:26.960> that<00:01:28.369> the<00:01:29.369> mold<00:01:29.670> should<00:01:30.000> have

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
on the board that the mold should have

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.960 
on the board that the mold should have
the<00:01:30.299> briquettes<00:01:31.079> stuck<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.770> in<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.820> what's

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
the briquettes stuck it in so what's

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.240 
the briquettes stuck it in so what's
gonna<00:01:33.150> end<00:01:33.299> up<00:01:33.390> happening<00:01:33.560> this<00:01:34.560> on<00:01:34.799> here<00:01:35.220> and

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
gonna end up happening this on here and

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.730 
gonna end up happening this on here and
I'll<00:01:35.430> press<00:01:35.759> down<00:01:36.030> further<00:01:36.450> with<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.229> pistons

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
I'll press down further with the pistons

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.370 
I'll press down further with the pistons
and<00:01:38.040> they'll<00:01:38.670> push<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.270> bricks<00:01:39.630> out<00:01:39.900> on<00:01:40.320> the

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
and they'll push the bricks out on the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.469 
and they'll push the bricks out on the
bottom<00:01:40.790> so<00:01:41.790> that's<00:01:42.119> kind<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.780> plan<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:44.479> I'm

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
bottom so that's kind of the plan so I'm

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.940 
bottom so that's kind of the plan so I'm
gonna<00:01:45.600> test<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.170> now<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.470> see<00:01:46.560> if<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.740> works

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
gonna test it now and see if it works

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.610 
and put them on top of the fireplace and
what<00:05:26.270> I<00:05:26.300> find<00:05:26.600> these<00:05:26.750> useful<00:05:26.990> for<00:05:27.350> it<00:05:27.470> really

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
what I find these useful for it really

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.310 
what I find these useful for it really
is<00:05:27.860> not<00:05:28.180> heating<00:05:29.180> the<00:05:29.300> house<00:05:29.540> but<00:05:30.110> what<00:05:30.290> I

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
is not heating the house but what I

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.680 
is not heating the house but what I
think<00:05:30.440> is<00:05:30.800> the<00:05:30.919> best<00:05:31.100> usage<00:05:31.580> for<00:05:31.729> these<00:05:31.880> is

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
think is the best usage for these is

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.020 
think is the best usage for these is
fire<00:05:33.020> starters<00:05:33.530> they<00:05:34.130> actually<00:05:34.610> the<00:05:34.790> best

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
fire starters they actually the best

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.360 
fire starters they actually the best
once<00:05:35.990> they're<00:05:36.199> dry<00:05:36.410> you<00:05:36.830> throw<00:05:37.070> them<00:05:37.130> in<00:05:37.250> there

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
once they're dry you throw them in there

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.250 
once they're dry you throw them in there
at<00:05:37.520> night<00:05:37.550> watch<00:05:38.270> my<00:05:38.449> other<00:05:38.479> video<00:05:38.840> you'll<00:05:39.080> see

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
at night watch my other video you'll see

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.700 
at night watch my other video you'll see
it<00:05:39.380> pretty<00:05:40.070> cool<00:05:40.250> so<00:05:40.699> anyway<00:05:40.940> that's<00:05:41.300> the

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
it pretty cool so anyway that's the

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.010 
it pretty cool so anyway that's the
multiple<00:05:42.710> press
