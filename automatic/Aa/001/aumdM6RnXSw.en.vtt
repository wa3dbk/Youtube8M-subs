does for the dogs training
one<00:00:56.019> of<00:00:56.080> the<00:00:56.170> reasons<00:00:56.379> we<00:00:56.470> do<00:00:56.559> this<00:00:56.650> is<00:00:56.799> just

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:56.979 
one of the reasons we do this is just

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:58.799 
one of the reasons we do this is just
for<00:00:57.070> the<00:00:57.129> exercise<00:00:57.339> of<00:00:57.580> the<00:00:57.670> dog<00:00:57.820> just<00:00:58.269> plain

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
for the exercise of the dog just plain

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:00.930 
for the exercise of the dog just plain
old<00:00:58.960> running<00:00:59.260> is<00:00:59.379> boring<00:00:59.650> as<00:00:59.739> we<00:00:59.860> all<00:00:59.979> know<00:01:00.129> but

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
old running is boring as we all know but

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.939 
old running is boring as we all know but
also<00:01:01.330> more<00:01:01.720> importantly<00:01:01.780> on<00:01:02.530> a<00:01:02.589> day-to-day

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
also more importantly on a day-to-day

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:04.380 
also more importantly on a day-to-day
basis<00:01:03.460> when<00:01:03.640> they're<00:01:03.790> working<00:01:04.180> they

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
basis when they're working they

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.399 
basis when they're working they
encounter<00:01:04.780> all<00:01:04.900> sorts<00:01:04.930> of<00:01:05.170> different

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:30.649 

boots<00:01:27.320> it's<00:01:28.520> some<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.700> obstacles<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.479> we

boots it's some of the obstacles that we
see<00:01:30.869> here<00:01:31.080> and<00:01:31.229> being<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:31.920> tubular<00:01:32.460> tunnel

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
see here and being this tubular tunnel

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:35.450 
see here and being this tubular tunnel
seems<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.080> little<00:01:34.200> bit<00:01:34.440> far-fetched<00:01:34.680> for<00:01:35.159> a

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
seems a little bit far-fetched for a

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.490 
seems a little bit far-fetched for a
situation<00:01:36.270> but<00:01:36.420> obviously<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:37.020> has<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.200> meaning

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
situation but obviously it has a meaning

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.560 
situation but obviously it has a meaning
yes<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.250> does<00:01:38.399> like<00:01:38.970> all<00:01:39.149> of<00:01:39.270> them<00:01:39.360> they<00:01:39.450> have

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
yes it does like all of them they have

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.749 
yes it does like all of them they have
their<00:01:39.659> own<00:01:39.750> specific<00:01:39.960> purpose<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.520> tube

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
their own specific purpose that the tube

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.210 
their own specific purpose that the tube
is<00:01:41.970> something<00:01:42.539> to<00:01:42.960> test<00:01:43.170> their<00:01:43.770> abilities<00:01:44.100> to

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
is something to test their abilities to

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.480 
is something to test their abilities to
go<00:01:44.340> through<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.970> confined<00:01:45.570> spaces<00:01:46.039> so<00:01:47.039> so<00:01:47.220> this

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
go through a confined spaces so so this

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.649 
go through a confined spaces so so this
would<00:01:47.640> simulate<00:01:48.000> something<00:01:48.180> like<00:01:48.330> a<00:01:48.360> culvert

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
would simulate something like a culvert

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.690 
would simulate something like a culvert

constable I also noticed probably one of
the<00:02:25.739> more<00:02:25.920> important<00:02:27.049> strategic<00:02:28.220> obstacles

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
the more important strategic obstacles

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.850 
the more important strategic obstacles
here<00:02:29.400> would<00:02:30.090> be<00:02:30.239> the<00:02:30.480> teamwork<00:02:30.870> window<00:02:31.500> where

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
here would be the teamwork window where

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.830 
here would be the teamwork window where
you<00:02:32.190> actually<00:02:32.400> come<00:02:32.820> in<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:32.970> play<00:02:33.180> with<00:02:33.630> the

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.590 
you actually come in to play with the
Diablo<00:02:34.320> and<00:02:34.530> actually<00:02:35.220> help<00:02:35.430> them<00:02:35.579> along<00:02:35.790> yes

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
Diablo and actually help them along yes

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.300 
Diablo and actually help them along yes
on<00:02:37.079> the<00:02:37.200> street<00:02:37.380> ultimately<00:02:37.799> we<00:02:37.950> are<00:02:37.980> a<00:02:38.100> team

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
on the street ultimately we are a team

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.470 
on the street ultimately we are a team
and<00:02:38.340> we<00:02:38.549> have<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.760> be<00:02:38.880> able<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:39.120> get<00:02:39.269> over

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
and we have to be able to get over

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.150 
and we have to be able to get over
through<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.079> around<00:02:40.290> any<00:02:40.500> obstacle<00:02:40.980> that<00:02:41.010> we

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
through and around any obstacle that we

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.009 
through and around any obstacle that we
encounter<00:02:41.640> to<00:02:41.850> end<00:02:42.180> up<00:02:42.329> getting<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.810> job<00:02:42.840> done

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
encounter to end up getting the job done

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.280 
encounter to end up getting the job done
so<00:02:43.579> if<00:02:44.579> it<00:02:44.790> means<00:02:44.940> that<00:02:45.359> Diablo<00:02:45.750> jumps<00:02:46.019> off<00:02:46.140> my

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
so if it means that Diablo jumps off my

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.780 
so if it means that Diablo jumps off my
back<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.620> get<00:02:46.709> over<00:02:46.890> a<00:02:46.920> fence<00:02:47.100> or<00:02:47.310> have<00:02:47.489> to<00:02:47.609> lift

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
back to get over a fence or have to lift

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.640 
back to get over a fence or have to lift
him<00:02:47.910> over<00:02:48.120> a<00:02:48.150> fence<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:48.630> that's<00:02:48.989> just<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.530> way

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
him over a fence and that's just the way

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.870 
him over a fence and that's just the way
it<00:02:49.709> goes<00:02:49.769> and<00:02:50.040> that's<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.370> way<00:02:50.459> it<00:02:50.579> goes<00:02:50.700> then

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
it goes and that's the way it goes then

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.160 
it goes and that's the way it goes then
I<00:02:50.910> can<00:02:51.090> imagine<00:02:51.239> that<00:02:51.420> scenario<00:02:51.630> must<00:02:51.989> come<00:02:52.140> up

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
I can imagine that scenario must come up

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.840
