 Photo and video 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.890
 but you have to watch them all the same on 3ds 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.470
 traditional gaming connector 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.079

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.970
 on the table, moving the device away 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:58.159

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:08.659
 first watch how the table turns 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.690
 into a box cut into pieces or 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:12.440
 turns it inside out it's very
