00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
over the place and there you actually

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.660 
over the place and there you actually
can't<00:01:54.270> reach<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.689> ball<00:01:54.899> so<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:56.009> problem<00:01:56.399> a

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
can't reach the ball so the problem a

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.719 
can't reach the ball so the problem a

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
should have kept it wary to this and it

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:08.030 
should have kept it wary to this and it
should<00:02:53.760> put<00:02:53.910> me<00:02:54.000> cue<00:02:54.209> back<00:02:54.360> on<00:02:54.540> again<00:02:54.660> so<00:03:07.040> she's

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
see there now then obviously I can't

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.160 
see there now then obviously I can't
reach<00:03:17.310> so<00:03:18.180> what<00:03:18.359> they'll<00:03:18.480> tell<00:03:18.720> you<00:03:18.780> is<00:03:18.900> take<00:03:19.139> a
