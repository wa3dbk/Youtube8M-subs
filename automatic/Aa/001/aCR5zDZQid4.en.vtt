00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
and hello everyone welcome to a 1.8

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.619 
and hello everyone welcome to a 1.8
block<00:00:03.740> tutorial<00:00:04.740> so<00:00:05.400> we<00:00:05.940> will<00:00:06.089> be<00:00:06.210> going<00:00:06.450> over

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
block tutorial so we will be going over

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.299 
block tutorial so we will be going over
all<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.960> commands<00:00:07.259> that<00:00:07.350> affect<00:00:07.680> blocks<00:00:07.980> and

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
all the commands that affect blocks and

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.959 
all the commands that affect blocks and
the<00:00:08.400> new<00:00:08.550> 1.8<00:00:09.210> release<00:00:10.019> slash<00:00:10.530> snapshots<00:00:11.190> so

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
the new 1.8 release slash snapshots so

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.330 
the new 1.8 release slash snapshots so
the<00:00:12.090> first<00:00:12.420> one<00:00:12.660> is<00:00:12.690> clone<00:00:13.440> now<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.009> clone

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
the first one is clone now the clone

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.919 
the first one is clone now the clone
command<00:00:14.670> is<00:00:14.820> pretty<00:00:15.059> cool<00:00:15.299> in<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.630> sense<00:00:15.780> that

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
command is pretty cool in the sense that

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.620 
command is pretty cool in the sense that
it<00:00:16.109> takes<00:00:16.320> regions<00:00:16.890> up<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.369> 16<00:00:17.820> by<00:00:18.000> 16<00:00:18.060> by<00:00:18.570> 16

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
it takes regions up to 16 by 16 by 16

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.230 
it takes regions up to 16 by 16 by 16
and<00:00:19.320> puts<00:00:20.130> them<00:00:20.340> somewhere<00:00:20.369> else<00:00:20.880> in<00:00:21.150> your

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
and puts them somewhere else in your

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.670 
and puts them somewhere else in your
world<00:00:21.359> depending<00:00:21.930> on<00:00:22.080> where<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.470> want<00:00:22.619> to

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
world depending on where you want to

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.040 
world depending on where you want to
place<00:00:22.800> them<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.580> clones<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.240> pretty<00:00:24.900> cool

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
place them it clones it and pretty cool

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.679 
place them it clones it and pretty cool
like<00:00:25.380> copy<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.550> actual<00:00:26.849> command<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.330> clone

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
like copy so the actual command is clone

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.700 
like copy so the actual command is clone
the<00:00:28.529> first<00:00:29.220> set<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.580> coordinates<00:00:29.849> here<00:00:30.269> is<00:00:30.710> one

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
the first set of coordinates here is one

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.639 
the first set of coordinates here is one
area<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.340> region<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:33.360> next<00:00:33.960> set<00:00:34.469> of

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
area of the region the next set of

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.740 
area of the region the next set of
coordinates<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.489> other<00:00:35.790> corner<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.600> the

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
coordinates is the other corner of the

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.540 
coordinates is the other corner of the
region<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.410> then<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.860> third<00:00:38.280> set<00:00:38.520> of

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
region and then the third set of

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.540 
region and then the third set of
coordinates<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.690> corner<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.980> pasted

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
coordinates is the corner of the pasted

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.590 
coordinates is the corner of the pasted
region<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.780> if<00:00:42.899> we<00:00:43.020> do<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.440> we<00:00:44.160> see<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.399> our

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
region so if we do that we see that our

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.600 
region so if we do that we see that our
stone<00:00:45.600> area<00:00:46.050> or<00:00:46.260> or<00:00:46.469> area<00:00:46.860> has<00:00:47.100> been<00:00:47.280> cloned

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
stone area or or area has been cloned

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.880 
stone area or or area has been cloned
and<00:00:47.940> that's<00:00:48.180> pretty<00:00:48.450> cool<00:00:48.690> now<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.379> next

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
and that's pretty cool now the next

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.080 
and that's pretty cool now the next
command<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.340> we're<00:00:50.460> going<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.670> work<00:00:51.030> with

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
command that we're going to work with

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.020 
command that we're going to work with
today<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:52.110> fill<00:00:52.379> command<00:00:52.739> as<00:00:53.039> with<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
today is the fill command as with the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.569 
today is the fill command as with the
first<00:00:54.210> one<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.719> first<00:00:55.280> set<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.309> coordinates

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
first one the first set of coordinates

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.599 
first one the first set of coordinates
is<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.270> one<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.020> corners<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.980> second<00:00:59.520> set

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
is the one of the corners the second set

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.430 
is the one of the corners the second set
of<00:00:59.640> coordinates<00:00:59.820> is<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.480> second<00:01:00.899> corner<00:01:01.170> and

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
of coordinates is the second corner and

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.709 
of coordinates is the second corner and
then<00:01:02.129> we<00:01:02.399> determine<00:01:03.030> what<00:01:03.180> we<00:01:03.329> want<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.570> place

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
then we determine what we want to place

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.530 
then we determine what we want to place
in<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.140> minecraft<00:01:04.710> air<00:01:05.090> so<00:01:06.090> there<00:01:06.240> we<00:01:06.390> go

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
in it so minecraft air so there we go

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.410 
in it so minecraft air so there we go
our<00:01:06.720> our<00:01:06.990> area<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.040> now<00:01:08.189> filled<00:01:08.460> with<00:01:08.549> air<00:01:08.820> so

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
our our area is now filled with air so

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.050 
our our area is now filled with air so
let's<00:01:09.720> fill<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.320> with<00:01:10.439> stone<00:01:10.830> this<00:01:11.159> time<00:01:11.400> same

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
let's fill it with stone this time same

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.030 
let's fill it with stone this time same
basic<00:01:12.450> command<00:01:12.780> except<00:01:13.200> we<00:01:13.290> changed<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.799> to

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
basic command except we changed it to

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.630 
basic command except we changed it to
minecraft<00:01:14.460> stone<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.560> we've<00:01:16.560> got<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:17.009> region

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
minecraft stone and we've got a region

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.330 
minecraft stone and we've got a region
of<00:01:17.670> stone<00:01:18.270> all<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.990> way<00:01:19.110> through<00:01:19.439> now<00:01:20.070> if<00:01:20.189> you

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
of stone all the way through now if you

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.800 
of stone all the way through now if you
want<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.610> create<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.939> region<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.509> is

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
want to create that region that is

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.100 
want to create that region that is
hollow<00:01:22.560> all<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:24.180> have<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.390> do<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.659> change<00:01:24.900> the

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
hollow all you have to do is change the

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.249 
hollow all you have to do is change the
command<00:01:25.350> by<00:01:25.770> adding<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.460> zero<00:01:27.390> after<00:01:27.689> minecraft

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
command by adding a zero after minecraft

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.609 
command by adding a zero after minecraft
stone<00:01:28.619> because<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.900> tile<00:01:30.900> ID<00:01:31.200> data

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
stone because that is the tile ID data

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.810 
stone because that is the tile ID data
given<00:01:32.250> if<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.729> were<00:01:32.939> using<00:01:33.600> wool<00:01:34.530> or<00:01:34.979> glass

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
given if you were using wool or glass

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.310 
given if you were using wool or glass
you<00:01:36.240> know<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.570> would<00:01:36.720> be<00:01:36.750> where<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.229> would

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
you know that would be where you would

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.050 
you know that would be where you would
change<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.740> color<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.430> then<00:01:38.909> after

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
change the color of it and then after

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.469 
change the color of it and then after
that<00:01:39.420> we<00:01:39.869> put<00:01:40.079> Hollow<00:01:40.850> which<00:01:41.850> then<00:01:42.119> creates

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
that we put Hollow which then creates

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.929 
that we put Hollow which then creates
the<00:01:42.780> region<00:01:43.320> again<00:01:43.590> with<00:01:43.799> stone<00:01:44.070> but<00:01:44.729> it's<00:01:44.850> a

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
the region again with stone but it's a

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.469 
the region again with stone but it's a
hollow<00:01:45.320> region<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:46.470> which<00:01:46.619> we<00:01:46.770> can<00:01:46.890> go<00:01:47.009> inside

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
hollow region in which we can go inside

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.420 
hollow region in which we can go inside
so<00:01:48.479> pretty<00:01:48.780> cool

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
so pretty cool

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.819 
so pretty cool
now<00:01:50.430> after<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.270> another<00:01:51.899> cool<00:01:52.259> feature<00:01:52.409> in

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
now after that another cool feature in

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.179 
now after that another cool feature in
this<00:01:53.280> snapshot<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:54.229> testing<00:01:55.229> for<00:01:55.530> blocks<00:01:55.890> and

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
this snapshot is testing for blocks and

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.219 
this snapshot is testing for blocks and
now<00:01:56.340> what<00:01:56.579> this<00:01:56.729> does<00:01:56.790> is<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.509> determined

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
now what this does is it is determined

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.490 
now what this does is it is determined
if<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.350> two<00:01:58.590> regions<00:01:59.040> are<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.549> same<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.930> let's

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
if the two regions are the same so let's

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.429 
if the two regions are the same so let's
clear<00:02:02.159> this<00:02:02.430> stone<00:02:03.030> copy<00:02:03.540> our<00:02:03.810> original

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
clear this stone copy our original

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.639 
clear this stone copy our original
region<00:02:04.710> over<00:02:04.920> again<00:02:05.329> now<00:02:06.329> if<00:02:06.630> test<00:02:07.200> for<00:02:07.409> blocks

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
region over again now if test for blocks

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.369 
region over again now if test for blocks
is<00:02:07.920> under<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.489> normal<00:02:08.970> condition<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:10.170> will

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
is under the normal condition it will

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.080 
is under the normal condition it will
only<00:02:10.619> output<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.430> signal<00:02:11.849> through<00:02:12.000> a

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
only output a signal through a

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.370 
only output a signal through a
comparator<00:02:12.750> if

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
comparator if

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.400 
comparator if
the<00:02:13.470> two<00:02:13.680> regions<00:02:14.160> are<00:02:14.400> exactly<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.180> same<00:02:15.410> so

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
the two regions are exactly the same so

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.760 
the two regions are exactly the same so
if<00:02:16.530> we<00:02:16.650> do<00:02:16.800> that<00:02:16.830> there<00:02:17.460> we<00:02:17.610> go<00:02:18.380> now<00:02:19.380> if<00:02:19.620> we

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
if we do that there we go now if we

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.700 
if we do that there we go now if we
effect<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.430> second<00:02:20.790> region<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.530> run<00:02:22.530> that

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
effect the second region and run that

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.860 
effect the second region and run that
command<00:02:22.830> again<00:02:23.310> it<00:02:24.030> will<00:02:24.240> not<00:02:24.420> like<00:02:24.660> it

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
command again it will not like it

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.890 
command again it will not like it
because<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.770> region<00:02:26.040> has<00:02:26.190> been<00:02:26.340> affected<00:02:26.900> but

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
because the region has been affected but

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.780 
because the region has been affected but
as<00:02:28.260> you<00:02:28.590> notice<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.040> original<00:02:29.130> blocks<00:02:29.610> are

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
as you notice the original blocks are

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:30.530 
as you notice the original blocks are
still<00:02:30.000> there

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
still there

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.420 
still there
so<00:02:30.870> if<00:02:31.020> you<00:02:31.110> wanted<00:02:31.350> to<00:02:31.410> test<00:02:31.740> for<00:02:31.980> if<00:02:32.250> the

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
so if you wanted to test for if the

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.160 
so if you wanted to test for if the
original<00:02:32.700> blocks<00:02:33.180> from<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.570> first<00:02:33.810> region

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
original blocks from the first region

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.910 
original blocks from the first region
are<00:02:34.290> still<00:02:34.620> there<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.730> added<00:02:36.060> blocks<00:02:36.920> in

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
are still there and the added blocks in

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.950 
are still there and the added blocks in
the<00:02:38.280> second<00:02:38.640> region<00:02:38.970> you<00:02:39.390> would<00:02:39.480> use<00:02:39.690> tests

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
the second region you would use tests

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.860 
the second region you would use tests
for<00:02:40.140> blocks<00:02:40.580> masked<00:02:41.580> and<00:02:41.790> you<00:02:42.510> just<00:02:42.660> put<00:02:42.840> that

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
for blocks masked and you just put that

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.140 
for blocks masked and you just put that
on<00:02:42.990> the<00:02:43.200> end<00:02:43.320> same<00:02:44.190> type<00:02:44.400> of<00:02:44.430> coordinate<00:02:44.910> deal

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
on the end same type of coordinate deal

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.990 
on the end same type of coordinate deal
where<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:46.190> first<00:02:47.190> two<00:02:47.460> sets<00:02:47.700> of<00:02:47.790> coordinates

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
where the first two sets of coordinates

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.850 
where the first two sets of coordinates
are<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.360> corners<00:02:48.870> of<00:02:48.990> the<00:02:49.050> first<00:02:49.260> region<00:02:49.650> and

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
are the corners of the first region and

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.100 
are the corners of the first region and
then<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.310> third<00:02:50.850> set<00:02:51.060> of<00:02:51.180> coordinates<00:02:51.540> is<00:02:51.750> the

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
then the third set of coordinates is the

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.800 
then the third set of coordinates is the
corner<00:02:52.470> of<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.620> second<00:02:52.920> region<00:02:53.070> and<00:02:53.810> with

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
corner of the second region and with

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.330 
corner of the second region and with
that<00:02:55.170> guys<00:02:55.440> if<00:02:55.770> you<00:02:55.920> learned<00:02:56.220> something

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340
