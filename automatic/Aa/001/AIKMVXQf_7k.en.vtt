00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
the reader did was and and she's done

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.139 
the reader did was and and she's done
this<00:00:53.850> before<00:00:53.910> she<00:00:54.539> looked<00:00:54.750> at<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.989> cards<00:00:55.410> and

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
this before she looked at the cards and

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.849 
this before she looked at the cards and
with<00:00:57.149> her<00:00:57.329> method<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:57.989> with<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.320> general

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
with her method and with a general

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.709 
with her method and with a general
method<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.280> just<00:00:59.399> look<00:00:59.579> at<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.789> cards<00:01:00.120> the

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
method you just look at the cards the

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.299 
method you just look at the cards the
first<00:01:00.960> card<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.379> happens<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.890> be<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.100> first

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
first card is happens to be the first

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.200 
first card is happens to be the first
but<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.519> doesn't<00:01:02.760> mean<00:01:02.820> it's<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.030> most

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
but it doesn't mean it's a most

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.900 
but it doesn't mean it's a most
important<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:04.500> may<00:01:04.860> be<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.129> most<00:01:05.160> important

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:05.910 
important this may be the most important

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.880 
important this may be the most important
but<00:01:06.180> not<00:01:06.750> because<00:01:06.960> it's<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.440> middle<00:01:07.770> but

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
but not because it's in the middle but

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.670 
but not because it's in the middle but
because<00:01:08.250> it's<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.490> most<00:01:08.670> important<00:01:09.680> you

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
because it's the most important you

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.800 
because it's the most important you
maybe<00:01:10.890> talk<00:01:11.400> about<00:01:11.640> each<00:01:11.790> card<00:01:12.120> individually

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
maybe talk about each card individually

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.510 
maybe talk about each card individually
or<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.990> can<00:01:13.200> combine<00:01:13.410> these<00:01:13.800> two<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.400> these

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
or you can combine these two and these

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.400 
or you can combine these two and these
two<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.910> these<00:01:15.060> two<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.690> you<00:01:16.110> can<00:01:16.260> combine

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
two and these two and you can combine

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.400 
two and these two and you can combine
all<00:01:16.770> three<00:01:17.450> to<00:01:18.450> get<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.630> kind<00:01:18.870> of<00:01:18.960> composite

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.410 
all three to get a kind of composite

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.620 
all three to get a kind of composite
meaning<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.100> that's<00:01:20.730> that's<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.180> method<00:01:21.600> that

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
meaning and that's that's a method that

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.980 
meaning and that's that's a method that
a<00:01:21.960> lot<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.590> people<00:01:22.710> years<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:24.480> can<00:01:24.810> be<00:01:24.840> very

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
a lot of people years and it can be very

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.830 
a lot of people years and it can be very
good<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.980> the<00:01:26.730> reader<00:01:26.940> who<00:01:27.150> did<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:27.540> for

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
good and the the reader who did this for

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.400 
good and the the reader who did this for
the<00:01:27.980> questioner<00:01:28.980> and<00:01:29.600> talked<00:01:30.600> about<00:01:30.900> stress

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
the questioner and talked about stress

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.400 
the questioner and talked about stress
and<00:01:31.800> low<00:01:32.040> energy<00:01:32.490> level<00:01:32.910> and<00:01:33.120> so<00:01:33.330> on<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.840> all

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
and low energy level and so on and all

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.320 
and low energy level and so on and all
that<00:01:34.620> she<00:01:34.770> said<00:01:34.800> was<00:01:35.040> correct<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.970> the

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
that she said was correct and the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
question are appreciated that what had

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.420 
question are appreciated that what had
been<00:01:38.190> said<00:01:38.250> was<00:01:38.610> accurate<00:01:39.060> as<00:01:39.210> well<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:41.280> only

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
been said was accurate as well the only

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.920 
been said was accurate as well the only
thing<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.760> that<00:01:41.790> this<00:01:42.120> kind<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.510> approach<00:01:42.660> of

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
thing is that this kind of approach of

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.370 
thing is that this kind of approach of
taking<00:01:43.290> three<00:01:43.710> cards<00:01:44.160> and<00:01:45.020> sort<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.140> not

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
taking three cards and sort of not

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.610 
taking three cards and sort of not
making<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.920> up<00:01:46.980> as<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.160> go<00:01:47.250> along<00:01:47.430> but<00:01:47.970> but

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
making it up as you go along but but

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.830 
making it up as you go along but but
making<00:01:49.620> sense<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.250> at<00:01:50.400> that<00:01:50.610> moment<00:01:50.940> it<00:01:51.570> can

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
making sense of it at that moment it can

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.570 
making sense of it at that moment it can
be<00:01:52.020> really<00:01:52.290> really<00:01:52.410> good<00:01:52.560> because<00:01:53.130> it's<00:01:53.430> like

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
be really really good because it's like

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.460 
be really really good because it's like
multi-layered<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.540> it's<00:01:54.900> a<00:01:54.960> bit<00:01:55.140> like<00:01:55.260> this

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
multi-layered and it's a bit like this

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.770 
multi-layered and it's a bit like this
postcard<00:01:56.040> by<00:01:56.250> marguerite<00:01:56.760> where<00:01:57.690> he's

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
postcard by marguerite where he's

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.360 
postcard by marguerite where he's
looking<00:01:58.080> at<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.230> egg<00:01:58.440> and<00:01:58.740> he's<00:01:58.830> painting<00:01:59.250> the

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
looking at the egg and he's painting the

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.960 
looking at the egg and he's painting the
bird<00:01:59.580> right<00:02:00.330> um<00:02:00.650> and<00:02:01.650> it's<00:02:02.550> a<00:02:02.610> bit<00:02:02.730> like<00:02:02.850> you

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
bird right um and it's a bit like you

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.700 
bird right um and it's a bit like you
look<00:02:03.120> at<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.300> three<00:02:03.510> cards<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.260> you<00:02:04.410> paint

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
look at the three cards and you paint

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.830 
look at the three cards and you paint
the<00:02:04.980> picture<00:02:05.430> or<00:02:05.640> what<00:02:05.940> they<00:02:06.120> develop<00:02:06.510> into

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
the picture or what they develop into

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.589 
the picture or what they develop into
the<00:02:07.050> thing<00:02:07.620> is<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:08.220> can<00:02:08.489> be<00:02:08.670> very<00:02:08.700> good<00:02:09.209> but<00:02:09.270> who

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
the thing is it can be very good but who

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.910 
the thing is it can be very good but who
would<00:02:09.750> have<00:02:09.840> thought<00:02:10.050> I<00:02:10.349> mean<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:10.619> that's<00:02:10.800> a

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
would have thought I mean that that's a

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.130 
would have thought I mean that that's a
brilliant<00:02:11.190> idea<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.849> think<00:02:12.060> looking<00:02:12.870> at<00:02:13.019> the

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
brilliant idea I think looking at the

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.860 
brilliant idea I think looking at the
egg<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.530> paint

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
egg and paint

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.869 
egg and paint
the<00:02:13.930> bird<00:02:14.170> I<00:02:14.470> wish<00:02:14.799> I<00:02:14.890> thought<00:02:15.250> of<00:02:15.430> it<00:02:15.519> but<00:02:15.819> I

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
the bird I wish I thought of it but I

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:17.759 
the bird I wish I thought of it but I
hadn't<00:02:16.390> and<00:02:16.840> that's<00:02:17.049> the<00:02:17.110> thing<00:02:17.319> I<00:02:17.409> think

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
hadn't and that's the thing I think

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.009 
hadn't and that's the thing I think
about<00:02:18.069> this<00:02:18.280> type<00:02:18.549> of<00:02:18.580> reading<00:02:19.030> a<00:02:19.180> free-form

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
about this type of reading a free-form

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.190 
about this type of reading a free-form
reading<00:02:20.379> we<00:02:20.500> could<00:02:20.650> call<00:02:20.860> it<00:02:20.890> where<00:02:22.019> you<00:02:23.019> have

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
reading we could call it where you have

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.910 
reading we could call it where you have
to<00:02:23.349> be<00:02:23.470> in<00:02:23.530> good<00:02:23.680> shape<00:02:23.739> or<00:02:25.349> it's<00:02:26.349> sometimes

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
to be in good shape or it's sometimes

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.490 
to be in good shape or it's sometimes
brilliant<00:02:27.580> but<00:02:27.760> other<00:02:28.090> times<00:02:28.510> it's<00:02:28.810> not<00:02:29.140> and

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
brilliant but other times it's not and

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.300 
brilliant but other times it's not and
it's<00:02:31.319> partly<00:02:32.319> I<00:02:32.440> think<00:02:32.530> because<00:02:33.069> your

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
it's partly I think because your

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.910 
it's partly I think because your
intuition<00:02:33.970> can<00:02:34.150> be<00:02:34.390> off<00:02:34.959> on<00:02:35.440> that<00:02:35.709> particular

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
intuition can be off on that particular

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.100 
intuition can be off on that particular
day<00:02:36.310> or<00:02:36.670> you're<00:02:36.819> not<00:02:36.940> quite<00:02:37.269> as<00:02:37.480> psychically

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
day or you're not quite as psychically

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.069 
day or you're not quite as psychically
it<00:02:38.409> tuned<00:02:38.890> in<00:02:39.129> as<00:02:39.370> you<00:02:39.879> might<00:02:40.060> normally<00:02:40.299> be<00:02:40.629> so

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
it tuned in as you might normally be so

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.740 
it tuned in as you might normally be so
it<00:02:41.590> can<00:02:41.829> work<00:02:42.040> extremely<00:02:42.519> well<00:02:42.670> but<00:02:42.970> that<00:02:43.180> are

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
it can work extremely well but that are

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.990 
it can work extremely well but that are
going<00:02:43.959> to<00:02:44.019> be<00:02:44.079> times<00:02:44.319> when<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:45.159> psychic

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
going to be times when the psychic

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.240 
going to be times when the psychic
impression<00:02:46.540> be<00:02:46.660> is<00:02:46.840> inaccessible<00:02:47.470> that

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
impression be is inaccessible that

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.520 
impression be is inaccessible that
particular<00:02:48.819> day<00:02:48.849> or<00:02:49.269> in<00:02:49.599> some<00:02:50.140> way<00:02:50.290> you're<00:02:50.410> not

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
particular day or in some way you're not

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.390 
particular day or in some way you're not
connecting<00:02:51.099> with<00:02:51.280> what<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.299> cards<00:02:52.690> mean<00:02:52.959> or

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
connecting with what the cards mean or

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.670 
connecting with what the cards mean or
else<00:02:54.400> you<00:02:54.489> just<00:02:54.609> basically<00:02:54.849> not<00:02:55.269> sure<00:02:55.660> what<00:02:56.470> to

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
else you just basically not sure what to

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.009 
else you just basically not sure what to
do<00:02:56.859> with<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:57.340> cards<00:02:57.609> and<00:02:58.090> that's<00:02:58.750> frustrating

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
do with the cards and that's frustrating

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.490 
do with the cards and that's frustrating
and<00:02:59.530> annoying<00:03:00.209> whereas<00:03:01.209> so<00:03:01.690> if<00:03:01.930> you<00:03:02.109> find<00:03:02.379> you

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
and annoying whereas so if you find you

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.229 
and annoying whereas so if you find you
in<00:03:02.620> that<00:03:02.739> situation<00:03:02.980> when<00:03:03.459> you<00:03:03.549> try<00:03:03.819> the<00:03:03.879> three

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
in that situation when you try the three

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.580 
in that situation when you try the three
card<00:03:04.540> free<00:03:04.989> flow<00:03:05.319> and<00:03:05.620> it's<00:03:06.370> too<00:03:06.609> hard<00:03:07.590> think

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
card free flow and it's too hard think

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.640 
card free flow and it's too hard think
about<00:03:08.859> three<00:03:09.760> cards<00:03:10.180> past<00:03:10.510> present<00:03:11.230> and

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
about three cards past present and

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.949 
about three cards past present and
future<00:03:11.680> and<00:03:12.340> that<00:03:12.760> be<00:03:12.940> it<00:03:13.120> means<00:03:13.450> is<00:03:13.690> enough

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
future and that be it means is enough

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.270 
future and that be it means is enough
like<00:03:14.109> easier<00:03:14.500> to<00:03:14.590> read<00:03:14.739> the<00:03:14.859> car<00:03:15.069> because

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
like easier to read the car because

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.339 
like easier to read the car because
you've<00:03:15.519> got<00:03:15.609> a<00:03:15.670> context<00:03:16.480> we<00:03:16.959> know<00:03:17.079> that<00:03:17.230> this

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
you've got a context we know that this

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.099 
you've got a context we know that this
card<00:03:17.709> is<00:03:17.980> describing<00:03:18.489> something<00:03:18.910> about<00:03:19.900> the

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
card is describing something about the

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:25.229 
card is describing something about the
past<00:03:20.380> so<00:03:21.280> it<00:03:21.549> can<00:03:22.180> be<00:03:22.359> showing<00:03:23.079> old<00:03:24.239> situations

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
past so it can be showing old situations

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.390 
past so it can be showing old situations
or<00:03:25.389> earlier<00:03:26.169> conditions<00:03:26.889> that<00:03:27.069> no<00:03:27.220> longer

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
or earlier conditions that no longer

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.900 
or earlier conditions that no longer
exists<00:03:28.000> and<00:03:28.359> so<00:03:29.200> you<00:03:29.260> can<00:03:29.769> deal<00:03:29.980> with<00:03:30.010> it<00:03:30.190> maybe

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
exists and so you can deal with it maybe

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.909 
exists and so you can deal with it maybe
an<00:03:31.090> isolation<00:03:31.750> bit<00:03:31.900> to<00:03:32.019> get<00:03:32.139> an<00:03:32.290> idea<00:03:32.620> of<00:03:32.680> maybe

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:32.919 
an isolation bit to get an idea of maybe

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:35.280 
an isolation bit to get an idea of maybe
what<00:03:33.579> the<00:03:33.760> house<00:03:33.910> is<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.419> question<00:03:35.049> was<00:03:35.139> about

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
what the house is the question was about

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.520 
what the house is the question was about
a<00:03:35.440> man's<00:03:35.739> career<00:03:36.099> it<00:03:36.760> could<00:03:36.970> indicate<00:03:37.419> what<00:03:37.900> he

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
a man's career it could indicate what he

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.979 
a man's career it could indicate what he
what<00:03:39.099> kind<00:03:39.220> of<00:03:39.340> attitude<00:03:39.549> or<00:03:40.090> ideas<00:03:40.599> good

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
what kind of attitude or ideas good

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.319 
what kind of attitude or ideas good
ideas<00:03:41.349> about<00:03:41.590> ideas<00:03:42.069> he<00:03:42.489> brings<00:03:42.819> from<00:03:43.269> the

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
ideas about ideas he brings from the

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:46.319 
ideas about ideas he brings from the
past<00:03:43.750> into<00:03:44.049> the<00:03:44.319> present<00:03:45.000> and<00:03:46.000> so<00:03:46.150> it<00:03:46.209> gives

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
past into the present and so it gives

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.409 
past into the present and so it gives
you<00:03:46.540> a<00:03:46.720> background<00:03:47.650> or<00:03:47.949> context<00:03:48.669> against

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:49.419 
you a background or context against

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:52.020 
you a background or context against
which<00:03:49.660> to<00:03:49.900> want<00:03:50.109> to<00:03:50.500> to<00:03:51.069> to<00:03:51.250> make<00:03:51.400> sense<00:03:51.730> of<00:03:51.879> the

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
which to want to to to make sense of the

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.420

to continue in the next stage shown by
the<00:04:39.280> following<00:04:40.120> card<00:04:42.840> so<00:04:43.840> if<00:04:44.050> we<00:04:44.139> take<00:04:44.169> a<00:04:44.320> look

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
the following card so if we take a look

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.840 
the following card so if we take a look
at<00:04:44.590> this<00:04:44.740> one<00:04:44.980> first<00:04:45.310> this<00:04:45.490> Knight<00:04:45.700> of

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
at this one first this Knight of

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.550 
at this one first this Knight of
Pentacles<00:04:45.880> reversed<00:04:46.630> nights<00:04:46.870> and<00:04:47.080> messengers

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
Pentacles reversed nights and messengers

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.610 
Pentacles reversed nights and messengers
under<00:04:48.010> bring<00:04:48.250> news<00:04:48.669> right<00:04:49.389> and<00:04:49.660> coined<00:04:50.470> his

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
under bring news right and coined his

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.190 
under bring news right and coined his
money<00:04:50.889> so<00:04:51.400> this<00:04:51.550> can<00:04:52.120> simply<00:04:52.480> me<00:04:52.630> that<00:04:52.810> in<00:04:52.990> the

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
money so this can simply me that in the

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.860 
money so this can simply me that in the
past<00:04:53.380> was<00:04:53.889> bad<00:04:54.100> news<00:04:54.340> about<00:04:54.550> money<00:04:54.910> so<00:04:55.660> maybe

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
past was bad news about money so maybe

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.659 
past was bad news about money so maybe
he<00:04:56.080> wanted<00:04:56.350> a<00:04:56.470> promotion<00:04:56.650> he<00:04:57.160> wanted<00:04:57.430> a<00:04:57.520> new

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
he wanted a promotion he wanted a new

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:59.550 
he wanted a promotion he wanted a new
job<00:04:57.970> that<00:04:58.180> paid<00:04:58.389> more<00:04:58.660> he<00:04:59.169> didn't<00:04:59.410> get<00:04:59.500> the

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
job that paid more he didn't get the

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.100 
job that paid more he didn't get the
promotion<00:04:59.770> didn't<00:05:00.340> get<00:05:00.490> the<00:05:00.580> new<00:05:00.760> job<00:05:01.110> right

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
promotion didn't get the new job right

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:03.810 
promotion didn't get the new job right
because<00:05:02.410> the<00:05:02.979> knight<00:05:03.100> of<00:05:03.130> Pentacles<00:05:03.370> is

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
because the knight of Pentacles is

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.700 
because the knight of Pentacles is
reversed<00:05:04.180> and<00:05:04.450> that's<00:05:04.690> a<00:05:04.750> fact<00:05:04.960> it<00:05:05.380> doesn't

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
reversed and that's a fact it doesn't

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:06.750 
reversed and that's a fact it doesn't
mean<00:05:05.830> it's<00:05:05.979> going<00:05:06.100> to<00:05:06.190> happen<00:05:06.310> again<00:05:06.610> in<00:05:06.639> the

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
mean it's going to happen again in the

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.129 
mean it's going to happen again in the
future<00:05:06.850> it's<00:05:07.600> a<00:05:07.660> different<00:05:07.960> kind<00:05:08.020> of

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
future it's a different kind of

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:10.260 
future it's a different kind of
situation<00:05:08.710> but<00:05:09.310> you've<00:05:09.430> got<00:05:09.580> an<00:05:09.669> idea<00:05:10.000> about<00:05:10.150> a

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
situation but you've got an idea about a

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.469 
situation but you've got an idea about a
condition<00:05:10.780> in<00:05:10.840> the<00:05:10.900> past<00:05:11.669> also<00:05:12.669> because<00:05:12.970> the

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
condition in the past also because the

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:14.909 
condition in the past also because the
woman<00:05:13.600> asked<00:05:13.990> about<00:05:14.139> her<00:05:14.290> husband<00:05:14.740> who's<00:05:14.889> a

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
woman asked about her husband who's a

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:18.120 
woman asked about her husband who's a
man<00:05:15.220> and<00:05:15.490> a<00:05:16.240> knight<00:05:16.479> is<00:05:16.780> a<00:05:16.840> man<00:05:17.229> the<00:05:17.710> night's

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
man and a knight is a man the night's

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.030 
man and a knight is a man the night's
grow<00:05:18.520> up<00:05:18.700> to<00:05:18.880> be<00:05:19.000> kings<00:05:19.330> and<00:05:19.750> so<00:05:20.620> with<00:05:20.919> the

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
grow up to be kings and so with the

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.710 
grow up to be kings and so with the
night<00:05:21.190> upside<00:05:21.669> down<00:05:21.940> it<00:05:22.300> can<00:05:22.510> be<00:05:22.630> an

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
night upside down it can be an

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.860 
night upside down it can be an
indication<00:05:23.139> that<00:05:23.440> in<00:05:24.040> the<00:05:24.370> past<00:05:24.580> or<00:05:25.090> recently

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
indication that in the past or recently

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.469 
indication that in the past or recently
he<00:05:28.870> didn't<00:05:29.229> like<00:05:29.620> not<00:05:30.190> being<00:05:30.550> the<00:05:30.820> king<00:05:31.120> the

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
he didn't like not being the king the

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:33.900 
he didn't like not being the king the
king<00:05:31.690> is<00:05:31.810> somebody<00:05:32.140> who's<00:05:32.260> in<00:05:32.440> charge<00:05:32.470> and<00:05:33.130> so

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
king is somebody who's in charge and so

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.130 
king is somebody who's in charge and so
it<00:05:34.030> looks<00:05:34.240> like<00:05:34.330> he<00:05:34.600> wasn't<00:05:34.870> in<00:05:35.169> charge<00:05:35.200> and<00:05:37.140> he

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.140 
it looks like he wasn't in charge and he

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.510 
it looks like he wasn't in charge and he
wasn't<00:05:38.350> happy<00:05:38.650> with<00:05:38.860> it<00:05:38.979> because<00:05:39.070> sometimes

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
wasn't happy with it because sometimes

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.950 
wasn't happy with it because sometimes
you're<00:05:39.669> happy<00:05:40.000> not<00:05:40.270> to<00:05:40.300> have<00:05:40.450> to<00:05:40.690> make<00:05:40.810> the

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
you're happy not to have to make the

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.960 
you're happy not to have to make the
ultimate<00:05:40.990> decision<00:05:41.740> but<00:05:42.220> it<00:05:42.310> looks<00:05:42.520> like<00:05:42.729> the

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
ultimate decision but it looks like the

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.779

the<00:06:32.770> card<00:06:33.039> maybe<00:06:33.250> he<00:06:33.490> knew<00:06:34.140> what<00:06:35.140> was<00:06:35.229> going<00:06:35.470> to

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:35.500 
the card maybe he knew what was going to

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.700 
the card maybe he knew what was going to
happen<00:06:36.840> but<00:06:37.840> didn't<00:06:38.440> do

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:38.710 
happen but didn't do

happen but didn't do
thing<00:06:38.830> about<00:06:38.920> it<00:06:39.370> so<00:06:40.090> it<00:06:40.240> can<00:06:40.630> show<00:06:40.930> in

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:41.170

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:45.220 
maybe he would have been in a position

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.160 
maybe he would have been in a position
to<00:06:45.550> do<00:06:45.670> something<00:06:45.910> about<00:06:46.090> it<00:06:46.270> and<00:06:46.480> change<00:06:47.020> the

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.330 
inaction can have resulted in these two

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.530

cards<00:06:52.780> were<00:06:52.930> the<00:06:53.050> present<00:06:54.390> so<00:06:55.390> that's

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:55.540 
cards were the present so that's

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.600 
cards were the present so that's
something<00:06:55.990> about<00:06:56.320> the<00:06:56.470> cart<00:06:56.680> in<00:06:56.860> the<00:06:56.950> past<00:06:57.190> if

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:57.610 
something about the cart in the past if

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:58.890 
something about the cart in the past if
you<00:06:57.670> look<00:06:57.880> at<00:06:57.970> the<00:06:58.030> card<00:06:58.240> for<00:06:58.390> the<00:06:58.480> present

00:06:58.890 --> 00:06:58.900 
you look at the card for the present

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.510 
you look at the card for the present
we've<00:06:58.990> got<00:06:59.110> the<00:06:59.200> town<00:06:59.410> of<00:06:59.530> the<00:07:00.040> ten<00:07:00.220> of<00:07:00.250> swords

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:00.520 
we've got the town of the ten of swords

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.700 
we've got the town of the ten of swords
reverse<00:07:01.000> 10<00:07:01.510> is<00:07:01.630> one<00:07:01.810> plus<00:07:02.020> nothing<00:07:02.320> gets<00:07:02.650> you

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:02.710 
reverse 10 is one plus nothing gets you

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:04.760 
reverse 10 is one plus nothing gets you
back<00:07:02.890> to<00:07:03.040> one<00:07:03.190> again<00:07:03.520> but<00:07:04.240> it's<00:07:04.360> upside<00:07:04.660> down

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:04.770 
back to one again but it's upside down

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.710 
back to one again but it's upside down
so<00:07:05.770> one<00:07:05.920> is<00:07:06.040> a<00:07:06.070> new<00:07:06.250> beginning<00:07:06.400> and<00:07:06.850> a<00:07:07.450> 10

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:07.720 
so one is a new beginning and a 10

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.410 
so one is a new beginning and a 10
upside<00:07:08.170> down<00:07:08.410> the<00:07:09.100> new<00:07:09.310> start<00:07:09.730> is<00:07:09.910> going<00:07:10.180> to<00:07:10.300> be

upside down the new start is going to be

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.680 
upside down the new start is going to be
