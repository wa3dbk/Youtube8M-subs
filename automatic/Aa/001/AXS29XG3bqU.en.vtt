00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
game or I guess they're i'm pretty sure

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.959 
game or I guess they're i'm pretty sure
they're<00:00:58.050> like<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.530> know<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.219> know<00:00:59.309> San<00:00:59.940> Diego

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
they're like I know I know San Diego

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.670 
they're like I know I know San Diego
studios<00:01:00.539> makes<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.870> but<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.079> think<00:01:01.350> their

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
studios makes it but I think their

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.130 
studios makes it but I think their
partner<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.250> something<00:01:02.460> I'm<00:01:02.550> not<00:01:02.850> sure<00:01:03.000> the

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
partner to something I'm not sure the

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.149 
partner to something I'm not sure the
logistics<00:01:04.140> but<00:01:04.350> enough<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:04.769> any<00:01:04.920> sort<00:01:05.129> of

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
logistics but enough so any sort of

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.310 
logistics but enough so any sort of
behind<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:05.790> I'd<00:01:06.540> been<00:01:06.810> kind<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.110> leaning

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
behind it so I'd been kind of leaning

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.050 
behind it so I'd been kind of leaning
towards<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.710> entire<00:01:07.920> time<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.490> now

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
towards that the entire time and now

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.490 
towards that the entire time and now
that<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.420> price<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.780> going<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.200> be<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.320> hundred

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
that the price is going to be a hundred

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.500 
that the price is going to be a hundred
dollars<00:01:10.860> cheaper<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:11.939> substantial

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
dollars cheaper that is a substantial

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.480 
dollars cheaper that is a substantial
difference<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.140> me<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:13.770> i<00:01:13.799> think<00:01:13.920> i'm<00:01:14.250> going<00:01:14.400> to

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
difference to me so i think i'm going to

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.700 
difference to me so i think i'm going to
get<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.640> ps4<00:01:14.970> if<00:01:15.299> i<00:01:15.420> decide<00:01:15.840> right<00:01:16.080> now<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.290> would

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
get a ps4 if i decide right now I would

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.120 
get a ps4 if i decide right now I would
um<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.970> know<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.229> Xbox<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.860> seems<00:01:20.009> like

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
it's going to be it's becoming more than

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.100 
it's going to be it's becoming more than
just<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.070> gaming<00:01:29.430> system<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.820> ps4<00:01:30.119> store<00:01:30.720> sort

get the ps4 even though it comes out a
month<00:02:11.340> later<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:11.700> think

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
month later I think

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.620 
month later I think
could<00:02:12.510> wait<00:02:13.010> I'd<00:02:14.010> try<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.700> be<00:02:15.120> patient<00:02:15.360> about

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
could wait I'd try to be patient about

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.809 
could wait I'd try to be patient about
it<00:02:15.900> but<00:02:16.050> I<00:02:16.200> think<00:02:16.380> I<00:02:16.650> could<00:02:16.709> wait<00:02:16.950> um<00:02:17.220> I<00:02:17.670> think

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
it but I think I could wait um I think

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.540 
it but I think I could wait um I think
that<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:19.050> fact<00:02:19.410> that<00:02:19.530> it<00:02:19.709> focuses<00:02:20.069> more<00:02:20.490> on

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
that the fact that it focuses more on

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.940 
that the fact that it focuses more on
