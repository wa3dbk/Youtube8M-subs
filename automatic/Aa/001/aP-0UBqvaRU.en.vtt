looking to improve the look internally
externally<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.629> just<00:00:40.170> sort<00:00:40.379> of<00:00:40.410> moderniser

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.680 
externally and just sort of moderniser
really<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.610> because<00:00:42.329> she's<00:00:42.480> still<00:00:42.629> a

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
really and because she's still a

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.290 
really and because she's still a
great-looking<00:00:43.260> boat<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.770> in<00:00:44.640> my<00:00:44.789> opinion<00:00:44.940> as

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
great-looking boat and in my opinion as

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.400 
great-looking boat and in my opinion as
good<00:00:45.450> as<00:00:45.570> some<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.899> boats<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.200> still

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
good as some of the boats that still

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.920 
good as some of the boats that still
come<00:00:46.559> out<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.770> factory<00:00:47.129> now<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.750> so<00:00:48.750> it's

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
come out the factory now and so it's

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.840 
come out the factory now and so it's
just<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.289> an<00:00:49.530> ongoing<00:00:49.739> process<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.670> keeping

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
just the an ongoing process of keeping

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.260 
just the an ongoing process of keeping
there<00:00:51.149> looking<00:00:51.390> good<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:52.129> this<00:00:53.129> seems<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.180> be

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
there looking good and this seems to be

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.880 
there looking good and this seems to be
a<00:00:54.390> good<00:00:54.539> idea<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.960> like<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.320> idea<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:55.770> it

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
a good idea I like the idea that it

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.760 
a good idea I like the idea that it
doesn't<00:00:56.190> fade<00:00:56.989> we<00:00:57.989> think<00:00:58.260> there's<00:00:58.440> possibly

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
doesn't fade we think there's possibly

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.240 
doesn't fade we think there's possibly
eight<00:00:59.300> ten<00:01:00.300> years<00:01:00.329> use<00:01:00.780> out<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.379> before<00:01:01.980> it

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
eight ten years use out of it before it

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.299 
eight ten years use out of it before it
might<00:01:02.430> need<00:01:02.609> renewing<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.949> paint<00:01:04.949> will

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
might need renewing and paint will

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.609 
might need renewing and paint will
continue<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.820> fade<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.630> seems<00:01:06.930> like<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.229> a

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
continue to fade so it seems like a a

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.160 
continue to fade so it seems like a a
good<00:01:07.979> option<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.580> spoke<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.420> guys<00:01:09.570> at<00:01:09.869> wild

onto onto the boat and

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.910 
onto onto the boat and
so<00:02:13.110> from<00:02:14.110> our<00:02:14.230> point<00:02:14.350> of<00:02:14.440> view<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:14.620> boat<00:02:14.740> needs

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
so from our point of view the boat needs

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.550 
so from our point of view the boat needs
to<00:02:15.040> be<00:02:15.130> clean<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:15.640> dry<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:17.080> we<00:02:17.260> spend<00:02:17.470> a<00:02:17.530> lot

bigger fittings like the windows we'll

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.479 
bigger fittings like the windows we'll
just<00:03:02.110> trim<00:03:02.260> around<00:03:03.660> because<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:05.400> amount<00:03:06.400> of

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
section up here as well then you need to

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:14.430 
section up here as well then you need to
allow<00:04:01.360> more<00:04:01.540> days<00:04:01.750> more<00:04:02.590> time

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.990 

so<00:04:15.440> we've<00:04:15.620> been<00:04:15.740> here<00:04:15.950> about<00:04:16.160> half<00:04:16.370> a<00:04:16.519> day<00:04:16.700> and

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
so we've been here about half a day and

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.210 
so we've been here about half a day and
as<00:04:17.480> you'll<00:04:17.720> see<00:04:17.930> from<00:04:17.959> the<00:04:18.620> earlier<00:04:18.890> video<00:04:19.160> the

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
as you'll see from the earlier video the

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.650 
as you'll see from the earlier video the
side<00:04:19.610> of<00:04:19.700> the<00:04:19.790> boat<00:04:19.940> is<00:04:20.209> completely

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
side of the boat is completely

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.380 
side of the boat is completely
transformed<00:04:21.520> but<00:04:22.520> it's<00:04:22.670> not<00:04:22.790> my<00:04:22.910> opinion<00:04:23.150> that

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
transformed but it's not my opinion that

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.990 
transformed but it's not my opinion that
matters<00:04:23.690> its<00:04:23.870> grants<00:04:24.440> the<00:04:24.590> owner<00:04:24.820> so<00:04:25.820> any

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
matters its grants the owner so any

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.430 
matters its grants the owner so any
