00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
apparently use it as a mirror to see

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.789 
apparently use it as a mirror to see
yourself<00:03:02.329> but<00:03:03.329> you<00:03:03.630> can<00:03:03.780> do<00:03:03.900> that<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.380> move<00:03:04.680> it

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
yourself but you can do that and move it

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:13.660 
yourself but you can do that and move it
back<00:03:05.010> here<00:03:05.310> so<00:03:05.489> you<00:03:05.579> can<00:03:05.670> get<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:06.030> full<00:03:06.269> view

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
alright as you can see from the side

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:23.320 
alright as you can see from the side
view<00:03:16.440> how<00:03:17.040> it<00:03:17.190> stands<00:03:18.920> it's<00:03:19.920> pretty<00:03:20.280> sturdy

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.420 

you<00:03:24.330> can<00:03:24.450> also<00:03:24.570> lay<00:03:24.870> it<00:03:24.990> down<00:03:25.220> so<00:03:26.220> if<00:03:26.340> you
