00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.230
 How to eliminate acne on the good face 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:09.110
 first of all what you have to do 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:12.200
 is to go to the dermatologist they will give you certain 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:15.139
 very good pills and things like gels 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.900
 that will help you counteract that but 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.960
 keep in mind first if you're in the 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:24.170
 puberty that's normal even if it's in 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:28.310
 excess I for example had many 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:32.000
 granites at 13 of the 13 to 16 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.909
 years but now that I have a little more 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.250
 and I've been in the dermatologist for seven months 

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:41.410
 I can say that I am 90% cured 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.060
 medical science is miraculous but 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.130
 it turns out that it is not always due to the 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:48.530
 medicine is almost always because 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:51.250
 ends one cycle and starts another 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.870
 I really talk about hormonal cycles 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.780
 never use fatty products in your 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:00.050
 never face such as oil creams 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.769
 essential is to say anything that you have as 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.470
 component attached some oil or fat 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:09.110
 do not give them or raw that leaves scars 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.450
 many times I know it's tempting and that 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.870
 many times you will do it but treat what 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.180
 possible not to do it 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:19.620
 fourth place always disinfects the 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.470
 face with an astringent 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.480
 it's super important that you use only what 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.200
 that the dermatologist recommends you not 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:31.530
 use more things for the spots that 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.740
 there are many times I recommend you 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.390
 some makeups like true cover that 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.060
 They are water based and natural pigments 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.730
 that do not infect you, they do not leave your skin 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.440
 pasty and does not slip and hide 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.690
 a lot of imperfections slips and 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.270
 hidden many imperfections 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.730
 that's while you heal your scars 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.550
 but with abrasive gels you start to 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.680
 be a kind of feeling that what it does 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.860
 It is killing the skin and makes you renew it 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.980
 as if you were burned by the sun is 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.370
 frustrating why I recommend you do it 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:09.100
 When you are not going out, have hygiene in 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.950
 your face if you are a man always shave 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.460
 because the hairs have dirt that 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:19.120
 enters the pore and does it and it infects 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:21.130
 there the eruption comes out and if also for 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.620
 men and women wash every day 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.710
 in the shower the face that will help them like that 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.260
 to circulate the blood every time from time to time 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.770
 when does some steam actions for 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.180
 open the pores there you wash your face 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.760
 It is also good to dip your face in 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.010
 cold water this stimulates the veins to do 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.250
 circulate the blood and remove all those 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.060
 lumps you should always apply protective 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.760
 solar spray 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.690
 for oily skin try not to touch you 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.450
 a lot of face 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.970
 and be patient and feel proud of 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:58.890
