00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.460
 the nissan juke is this little urban suv 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.780
 who has before all a terrible mouth a 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.130
 mouth that keep even in its version 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.290
 entry-level that we try 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.330
 today this basic finish is 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.949
 available only with a single motor on the 1 6 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.619
 94 horsepower 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.119
 in the program no frills the 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.800
 exterior mirrors and handles 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.730
 of doors are noah and not color 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.650
 bodywork as on the version 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.150
 higher 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.750
 likewise the wheels are 16 inches with 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.880
 hubcaps 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.260
 but even so he keeps a very 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.160
 dynamic regardless of the angle of 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.780
 inside view no fuss 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.239
 high equipment but air conditioning 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.579
 the gps the bluetooth kit or the regulator 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.260
 inaccessible speed even in option 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.180
 but we still have the windows 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.950
 front electric or car radio the 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.210
 presentation remains particular with the 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.039
 gear lever implanted on a 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.780
 element that evokes the motorcycle tank 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.969
 in the back is good for two adults 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.489
 but not three one of the weak points 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.100
 duke comes from his chest with 251 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.329
 cubic decimeters it is very far from the 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.730
 377 cubic decimetres of a renault captur 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.129
 in addition the loading threshold is too 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.750
 even to follow all the juke that 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.150
 we had tried was dynamic ip 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.770
 even to be firm 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.510
 this version of the juke injection of 16 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.950
 inches and more considerate in suspension 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.790
 but remains pleasant to drive and little 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.560
 sensitive to the roll 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.299
 the little engine is quite 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.310
 sufficient in city â€‹â€‹principal vocation 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.890
 of the car it is more discreet to 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.450
 low road speed the 94 horses are 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.460
 of course less comfortable but still more 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.810
 convincing that catches or 2008 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.110
 with their three- cylinder input 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.820
 range 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.439
 weak points on the road 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.170
 soundproofing and distances from 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.000
 excessive braking 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.049
 the juke is above all a look even gold 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.340
 in this version more or less 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.680
 stripped he keeps his mouth of 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.820
 concept cars rolling good surprise 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.320
 this version was one of the 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.689
 more comfortable of the range and the 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.950
 little donkey and just overall 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.329
 one of the only weak points of 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.950
 the poor equipment in series is 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.750
 impossible to enrich by way of 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.030
 options the only one proposed is the 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.590
 metallic paint for 1000 euros of 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.850
 the higher the finish gets richer 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.540
 of alloy wheels is air conditioning 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.640
 manual 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.810
 it's in our opinion a better choice 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.810
 remains reasonable in budget
