00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.549
 hello welcome big intel 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.189
 amt and greet god in the weather it comes 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.170
 now a slightly more stable phase in 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.540
 things spring with more sun more 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.120
 heat however it takes depending on the place 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.289
 a little bit longer than it gets 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.029
 a lot of people again a bit 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.250
 be disappointed on the weekend because they 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.350
 know further east that live 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.230
 it is still hanging on sunday 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.670
 partly still raining that applies above all just 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.890
 for all people who are not really in the 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.210
 the extreme west of germany live the 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.550
 have already dry on the weekend 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.020
 Saarland up to the lower Rhine 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.600
 there it is already on the weekend 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.270
 reasonably dry and also friendly 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.930
 were more than all wanted one the 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.940
 a bit east are still on 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.070
 weekend to do with clouds 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.840
 saturday even less than on sunday 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.520
 it is then cloudy more often it rains 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.620
 even partly this is true, for example 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.300
 also for hamburg berlin also down to 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.699
 to Frankfurt so far direction 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.340
 it is also west and also bavaria 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.789
 anyway, and everything east of it leads 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.890
 funniest so it on the weekend 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:07.140
 just rearranged and so on 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.270
 mixed and then art really nice in 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.490
 the magic stick on wednesday and on 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.340
 most important holds with the high 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.520
 try with 25 degrees and the blind to 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.320
 partly in the flat country 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.909
 the vienna the austrians the 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.950
 have to wait again after that 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.229
 weekend still has to go through that yes 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.450
 also east of it took even more 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.000
 clouds and rain on monday 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.920
 then the slow breakthrough holds for it 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.560
 even a bit longer in the 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.150
 Thursdays in and after that 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.210
 relatively friendly and warm the 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.880
 temperatures temporarily until the 25th 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.710
 Grad 25 degrees a bit about that 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.630
 It's also the level you get in 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.670
 Germany can expect the climax of 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.159
 temperatures mostly tuesday to 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.479
 also part of wednesday 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.280
 wednesday and thursday then 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.780
 probably the next rain the 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.360
 next, maybe even 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.399
 Thunderstorm and then not again 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.390
 animal cold then it is just around 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:06.360
 the 20 degrees reasonably lukewarm afterwards 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.300
 even after that very warm 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.340
 from monday to wednesday mostly 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.100
 is this central sunny and warm 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.440
 phase afterwards 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.400
 then still easy 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.770
 above-average temperatures, however 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.810
 just not summer like what if 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.270
 experience the first half of the week 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.820
 So enjoy it if you like it 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.620
 The first half of the week is almost everywhere 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.750
 pretty safe and also very warm for 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.150
 the season after 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.430
 falling short of normal 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.140
 temperatures until then everything is fine again 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.130
 easy and goodbye and for god beautiful 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.130
