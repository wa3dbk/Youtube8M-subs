started<00:02:00.630> runescape<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:02.070> RuneScape's<00:02:02.969> a

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
started runescape and RuneScape's a

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.340 
started runescape and RuneScape's a
little<00:02:03.240> different<00:02:03.540> for<00:02:03.600> most<00:02:03.810> websites<00:02:04.049> you

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
little different for most websites you

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.620 
little different for most websites you

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
game have a real life value to be honest

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.570 
game have a real life value to be honest
and<00:02:09.319> so<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.560> really<00:02:10.590> does<00:02:10.920> make<00:02:11.069> runescape

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
and so it really does make runescape

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.360 
and so it really does make runescape
money<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.569> items<00:02:12.810> really

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
you know that's a gold mine for money a

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.229 
you know that's a gold mine for money a
middle<00:04:04.160> in<00:04:04.220> that<00:04:04.340> game<00:04:04.549> is<00:04:04.730> the<00:04:04.819> equivalent<00:04:05.000> of

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
middle in that game is the equivalent of

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.990 
middle in that game is the equivalent of
like<00:04:05.419> three<00:04:05.810> four<00:04:06.049> dollars<00:04:06.410> you<00:04:06.919> know<00:04:07.000> money's

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
like three four dollars you know money's

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.670 
like three four dollars you know money's
worth<00:04:08.180> quite<00:04:08.389> a<00:04:08.449> lot<00:04:08.510> in<00:04:08.629> that<00:04:08.720> game<00:04:08.989> so<00:04:09.199> it

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
worth quite a lot in that game so it

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.050 
worth quite a lot in that game so it
really<00:04:09.919> would<00:04:10.220> be<00:04:10.250> nice<00:04:10.430> for<00:04:10.459> them<00:04:10.669> to<00:04:10.730> add<00:04:10.910> in

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
really would be nice for them to add in

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.460 
really would be nice for them to add in
some<00:04:11.209> extra<00:04:11.299> security<00:04:11.780> measures<00:04:11.900> for<00:04:12.349> that

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
some extra security measures for that

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.830 
some extra security measures for that
and<00:04:12.730> then<00:04:13.730> there's<00:04:13.940> your<00:04:14.090> email<00:04:14.540> addresses

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840

very<00:04:16.549> very<00:04:16.849> secure<00:04:17.269> now<00:04:17.510> you<00:04:17.570> can<00:04:17.870> set<00:04:18.169> up<00:04:18.289> two

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
very very secure now you can set up two

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.529 
very very secure now you can set up two
step<00:04:18.919> verification<00:04:19.090> which<00:04:20.090> means<00:04:20.359> you<00:04:20.449> can

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 
step verification which means you can

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:22.690 
step verification which means you can
only<00:04:20.750> sign<00:04:21.109> in<00:04:21.260> to<00:04:21.380> an<00:04:21.469> email<00:04:21.739> account<00:04:22.010> if<00:04:22.219> you

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
only sign in to an email account if you

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.700 
only sign in to an email account if you
have<00:04:22.849> a<00:04:22.880> text<00:04:23.390> verification<00:04:24.229> so<00:04:24.409> that<00:04:24.530> means

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
have a text verification so that means

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.770 
have a text verification so that means
that<00:04:25.010> for<00:04:25.760> someone<00:04:25.940> to<00:04:26.150> hack<00:04:26.300> your<00:04:26.479> email

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:29.710 
they'll need to steal your fold as well
which<00:04:28.850> means<00:04:29.060> it<00:04:29.180> makes<00:04:29.390> it<00:04:29.510> virtually

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
which means it makes it virtually

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.210 
which means it makes it virtually
impossible<00:04:29.990> for<00:04:30.440> anyone<00:04:30.770> to<00:04:30.890> get<00:04:31.070> on<00:04:31.130> your

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:20.480 
fishing link and it can make it look

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.300 
fishing link and it can make it look
really<00:05:20.690> legit<00:05:21.110> and<00:05:21.290> I'm<00:05:21.710> sure<00:05:21.920> that<00:05:21.950> does

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
really legit and I'm sure that does

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.610 
really legit and I'm sure that does
catch<00:05:22.580> a<00:05:22.700> lot<00:05:22.850> of<00:05:22.910> people<00:05:23.030> out<00:05:23.270> and<00:05:23.510> you<00:05:23.620> might

be<00:05:33.740> visible<00:05:34.070> to<00:05:34.130> a<00:05:34.280> hacker<00:05:34.550> so<00:05:35.030> they<00:05:35.450> can

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
be visible to a hacker so they can

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.240 
be visible to a hacker so they can
obviously<00:05:35.780> download<00:05:36.230> an<00:05:36.410> email<00:05:36.800> list<00:05:37.010> of
