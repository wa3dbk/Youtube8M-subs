done what I needed to but it's nothing
special<00:02:26.019> i<00:02:26.290> mean<00:02:26.319> it<00:02:26.560> came<00:02:26.680> with<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:26.950> camera

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
special i mean it came with the camera

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.570 
special i mean it came with the camera
so<00:02:27.610> it<00:02:27.640> can't<00:02:28.090> be<00:02:28.150> anything<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:28.840> do<00:02:29.019> special

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580

it's a SEMA I think that's how you say
it<00:03:25.239> SEMA<00:03:25.780> or<00:03:25.930> saima<00:03:26.200> like<00:03:27.100> so<00:03:28.060> that<00:03:28.180> basically

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
it SEMA or saima like so that basically

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.349 
it SEMA or saima like so that basically
