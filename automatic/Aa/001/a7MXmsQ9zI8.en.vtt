00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:12.139
 well there are three ways of regulating the 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:17.220
 first buril the filter regulator that 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:20.789
 this one that marks the appearance that it has in 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:26.130
 guri according to the pressure chosen 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:31.609
 they can be 90 pounds or much less 30 d 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.609
 It is usually used from 30 to 90 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.550
 Y 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.760
 for example the compressor can deliver 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:43.620
 our pounds but the regulator of 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:47.050
 burin that is usually a filter 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:52.079
 regulator are both a filter 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:55.629
 of humidity and the pressure regulator 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:59.050
 can deliver much less to the bowl and for 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:03.330
 example the compressor can have 90 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:05.780
 pounds but delivery only 30 to 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:11.049
 albur and not 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:15.180
 well this other regulation is the pedal 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:19.440
 the pedal the only thing 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:22.220
 when the burin was idling or jose 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.220
 at idle 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:30.210
 what varies the air flow and the 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:33.930
 flow determine the speed of the 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:38.220
 piston the speed of the piston for 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:43.260
 forward to back means greater or 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:47.790
 lower this strength because you know 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:52.770
 that by the law of physics work 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.320
 is the path traveled by the 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.100
 force 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.100
 so 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:07.579
 at higher pressure and higher flow 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:13.090
 greater is the journey from everything 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:17.140
 is a bit limited by him 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:22.379
 by the regulation that makes the laptop or 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:28.860
 the anvil that is if you run further back 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:28.860
 this does not leave the rod 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:37.700
 it does not let the necklace lean too much 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:42.140
 that the air escapes then 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:45.500
 as the reaction is shorter or more the 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.950
 the piston is shorter at once 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:53.060
 it turns back and the road is 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:56.989
 Much travel is much less and strength 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:01.480
 also consequently this is less 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.480
 this is used in the 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:12.020
 the very light prints 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:15.440
 for example to make known would call 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:18.710
 those little lines that 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:23.660
 that are decorative nothing more than 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:28.700
 filling and for thicker lines 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:32.960
 sandpaper is sanding the laptop rock ando 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:38.270
 looking and this is going to determine that in 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:42.290
 the rod has more place for its 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:48.230
 forward rope is released a lot 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:51.530
 more air and the return path after 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.960
 the reaction is going to be stronger and because 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:59.570
 the blow is going to be stronger and the road 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:02.950
 of return is also going to be longer on 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:09.569
 Longer path means that the piston 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:12.640
 have more time to travel and 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:17.010
 at high speed 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.010
 and hits harder 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.630
 good
