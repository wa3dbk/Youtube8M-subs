00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 one two three 4 5 good time of day 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.340
 everyone who watches this video, his tea and 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.620
 sandwiches for smoked voice 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.660
 king who may be someone 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.030
 the soul may not 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.370
 this is the sixth video lesson 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.790
 rather small 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.740
 code injection video supplement 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.600
 and for articles you about which I have already 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.510
 wrote that already mentioned in previous 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.850
 lessons we were engaged in but engaged 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.090
 very briefly now look at this 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:36.480
 deal again we have open priced at 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.200
 we have a mortal kombat toy 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.180
 on pause 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.890
 she has such a timer now 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.790
 ninety eight seconds it shows 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.950
 here is its value 98 we will try 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.920
 do something steam right 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.949
 button we look what he writes on this 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.379
 the address falls out of the buttons and he's a couple 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:00.199
 win game to change timer value 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:05.040
 chip 9790 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:07.550
 97 and dropped us instruction click on 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.930
 her double button we look the instruction 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:14.909
 Moving pressure reduced version 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:18.900
 copies it to this address and this address 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:22.680
 us is the address with a timer value 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.000
 register ax in ikse we have 161 it 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.650
 hexadecimal numbering system 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.110
 so open the calculator 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.260
 if you can't hysterical count or 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:38.040
 we are lazy 61 and choose decimal 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:39.540
 97 and really this command will just copy 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.380
 us a new timer value according to logic 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.440
 things where this value changes 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.230
 click the show disassembler button 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.610
 the debugger window opens and more abruptly 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.040
 accordingly disassembling code 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.820
 games line with instructions that we 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.340
 hit when the timer worked when he 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.000
 changed below the window shows us 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.600
 memory and look at the processor code 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.129
 top-down command that is 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.979
 this here this this here this 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:14.849
 and so on we look what happened with 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:17.819
 yax here is a little higher here too 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:20.400
 what happened here is yak being compared 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.910
 with 20 points in the decimal system but 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.840
 here here 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:27.330
 hanging structure called as 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.360
 she decrement 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.740
 that is, this reduction is specific 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.990
 decrement by one 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.820
 to check it out well, that is, we 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.190
 decrement the register register ax 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.680
 the content we take and this instruction 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.620
 Replace the fruit that game I do 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:48.150
 that is, you see, foot teams are engaged 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:53.120
 at one byte he crawls coffin look at 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.120
 timer carefully it stands 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.990
 restore the original code here 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:05.010
 becoming a red cat back appeared 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:10.620
 team decreasing by one she too 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:14.670
 takes one byte by 8 5543 see 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.590
 always what can we do with them we can 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.060
 do in this case just like that 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.360
 right button 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.100
 but to pretend and write a new team 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.720
 there is a team dick means there is a team and 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.380
 increasing edinichku she 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.370
 I suggest an increment that is young 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.250
 we introduce young eax 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.000
 okay teams have changed let's climb the game 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.830
 the timer ran up 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.980
 such a thing can be done even better 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:43.700
 accordingly, we go to 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.950
 direct promotion menu code tools 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.620
 auto samba 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:53.250
 or control and then choose template 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.440
 injection code someone injection what 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:04:01.650
 address well yes this one can address it 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:04.950
 so leave ok that's what happens 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:09.450
 at this address instead of 1 byte of it 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:13.709
 instructions young yaksu us team jump 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:16.470
 jump right here right here and teams 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:19.200
 come here from here this here this 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:22.250
 here it is and then jump back that is 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.290
 here we will try to immediately change and 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:28.830
 let's see more accurately apply sorry 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:31.590
 click apply we sure will give us 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.889
 show where our code is now 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.800
 look at the debugger carefully 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:39.740
 here we had a team of young became 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:45.110
 command go to some address later 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:47.300
 on the knob button to the amount of code in 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.999
 the bytes remain the same and further on 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.650
 ready game code 

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:56.360
 go to the address of the right buttons 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:59.449
 before address but 1st 80,000 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:02.240
 kei what's going on here that is 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:05.389
 the outcome of the game he comes to jump jump 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.129
 here it increases eax compared to 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:09.580
 twenty tra ta ta ta ta ta ta why 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:12.500
 these teams were here these here 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:15.520
 because jump this command is long she 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:18.139
 Not a single byte is involved, like this 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.060
 a lot and therefore take a few 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:23.270
 teams with size on jump 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:26.539
 instead of putting jump and appending everything 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:33.830
 the rest from here goes jump back then 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:37.310
 there is a 0 0 so 0 0 428 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:40.279
 Okay Apt see so we jumped out of here 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.710
 there did something jump out of here 

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:46.759
 here that is back and continue 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:48.680
 further from the game it pauses we ground even 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:52.659
 nothing has changed in the bill but this code 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:58.159
 now somewhere else performed 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:06:02.650
 that is, these are the instructions that we 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:09.960
 we can already can 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:09.960
 take yax one and two times 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:19.500
 perform a given we were told to address in 01 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:23.289
 e 90000 go to him but leasing 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:26.500
 90000 clear here it is our code and jump 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:31.000
 back on the knot game if now by 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:32.889
 two seconds is taken away like this 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.710
 thing and accordingly here we can 

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:37.900
 do anything instead of these 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.289
 the instructions we need here 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.840
 are needed 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:43.270
 this is some kind of game here instead of these 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:46.930
 two can write do nothing 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:51.310
 york himself reduce it by 10 put 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:54.970
 there I don't know a thousand anything here 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:57.449
 So here is a brief explanation to all 

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.449
 thank
