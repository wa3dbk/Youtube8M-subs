so<00:00:00.240> in<00:00:00.450> this<00:00:00.570> clip<00:00:00.840> we'll<00:00:01.020> actually<00:00:01.290> be<00:00:01.620> doing

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
so in this clip we'll actually be doing

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.849 
so in this clip we'll actually be doing
the<00:00:02.490> neti<00:00:02.730> technique<00:00:03.480> I've<00:00:03.870> filled<00:00:04.620> the<00:00:04.710> neti

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
the neti technique I've filled the neti

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.120 
the neti technique I've filled the neti

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
butter and I'm going to add some sea

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.080 
butter and I'm going to add some sea
salt<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:10.860> depending<00:00:11.370> on<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.610> size<00:00:11.849> of<00:00:12.059> your

salt and depending on the size of your
neti<00:00:12.650> and<00:00:13.650> also<00:00:13.980> just<00:00:14.190> depending<00:00:14.610> on<00:00:14.759> how

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
neti and also just depending on how

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.240 
neti and also just depending on how
sensitive<00:00:15.870> you<00:00:16.170> are<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.590> amount<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:16.890> sea<00:00:17.070> salt

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
sensitive you are the amount of sea salt

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.750 
sensitive you are the amount of sea salt
will<00:00:17.460> vary<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:18.119> usually<00:00:18.690> put<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.439> good<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:20.310> don't

know<00:00:21.029> ten<00:00:21.449> second<00:00:22.109> sprinkle<00:00:23.570> and<00:00:24.619> then<00:00:25.619> you're

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
know ten second sprinkle and then you're

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.690 
know ten second sprinkle and then you're
going<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:25.920> want<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.160> shake<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.580> up<00:00:31.700> the

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
going to want to shake it up the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.080 
going to want to shake it up the
salinity<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.420> your<00:00:33.570> water<00:00:34.460> should<00:00:35.460> be<00:00:35.640> about

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
salinity of your water should be about

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.709 
salinity of your water should be about
what<00:00:36.780> your<00:00:36.899> tears<00:00:37.290> taste<00:00:37.649> like<00:00:38.540> so<00:00:39.540> that's

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
what your tears taste like so that's

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.630 
what your tears taste like so that's
about<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.290> appropriate<00:00:40.860> salinity<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.309> your

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
about the appropriate salinity of your

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.330 
about the appropriate salinity of your
body<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.530> then<00:00:43.530> this<00:00:44.190> next<00:00:44.640> step<00:00:45.590> might<00:00:46.590> be<00:00:46.620> a

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
body and then this next step might be a

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.119 
body and then this next step might be a
little<00:00:47.760> freaky<00:00:48.210> but<00:00:48.840> it's<00:00:48.899> totally<00:00:49.620> safe<00:00:49.890> and

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
little freaky but it's totally safe and

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.650 
little freaky but it's totally safe and
totally<00:00:50.579> easy<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:51.000> just<00:00:51.180> position<00:00:51.480> the

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
totally easy you just position the

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.369 
totally easy you just position the
nozzle

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
nozzle

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.130 
nozzle
woopsie<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:53.039> one<00:00:53.730> nostril<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.840> tilt<00:00:55.110> your

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
woopsie in one nostril and you tilt your

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.889 
woopsie in one nostril and you tilt your
head<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:55.530> it's<00:00:55.649> about<00:00:55.890> on<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.219> horizon<00:00:56.899> and

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
head so it's about on the horizon and

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.779 
head so it's about on the horizon and
you<00:00:57.930> can<00:00:58.199> see<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.710> water<00:00:58.920> pours<00:00:59.430> into<00:00:59.670> a

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
you can see that the water pours into a

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.420 
you can see that the water pours into a
nostril<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.780> out<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.170> other<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.250> could

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
nostril and out the other and I could

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.200 
nostril and out the other and I could
totally<00:01:02.670> talk<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.690> totally<00:01:04.260> breathe<00:01:05.030> you<00:01:06.030> just

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
totally talk it totally breathe you just

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.270 
totally talk it totally breathe you just
give<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.540> good<00:01:06.689> flow<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.650> might<00:01:07.830> feel<00:01:08.070> some

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
give it a good flow you might feel some

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.000 
give it a good flow you might feel some
pressure<00:01:08.490> in<00:01:08.760> your<00:01:08.909> ears<00:01:09.530> okay<00:01:10.530> when<00:01:10.830> it's

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
pressure in your ears okay when it's

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.429 
pressure in your ears okay when it's
time<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.400> change<00:01:11.580> sides<00:01:12.080> your<00:01:13.080> they<00:01:13.290> give<00:01:13.409> a

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
time to change sides your they give a

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:20.660 
time to change sides your they give a
little<00:01:13.650> blow<00:01:17.150> from<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.330> side<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.670> pour

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
little blow from the side that you pour

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.609 
little blow from the side that you pour
it<00:01:20.759> out<00:01:20.880> first<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.600> blow<00:01:21.810> out<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.170> side<00:01:22.409> and

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
it out first I blow out that side and

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:31.120 
it out first I blow out that side and
then<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.860> would<00:01:23.009> do<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.250> other<00:01:23.280> side

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.460 

the<00:01:32.130> sensation<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:33.000> not<00:01:33.210> much<00:01:33.509> different<00:01:34.080> from

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:46.210 

getting<00:01:37.470> water<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:38.040> your<00:01:38.159> toes<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.610> pool

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.700 

and<00:01:47.220> them<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:47.580> you<00:01:48.240> might<00:01:48.450> um<00:01:48.750> have<00:01:49.470> some

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
and them so you might um have some

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.999 
and them so you might um have some
tissues<00:01:50.100> handy<00:01:50.399> when<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.570> do<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.500> blowing

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
tissues handy when you do the blowing

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.889 
tissues handy when you do the blowing
through<00:01:53.399> one<00:01:53.580> nostril<00:01:53.729> at<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.060> time<00:01:54.299> after<00:01:54.600> the

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
through one nostril at a time after the

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.410 
through one nostril at a time after the
water<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.740> might<00:01:55.950> see<00:01:56.250> some<00:01:56.520> mucus<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.180> some

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
water you might see some mucus and some

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.940 
water you might see some mucus and some
stuff<00:01:57.630> coming<00:01:58.020> out<00:01:58.110> especially<00:01:58.680> if<00:01:58.770> your

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
stuff coming out especially if your

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.950 
stuff coming out especially if your
congestion<00:01:59.720> congested<00:02:00.720> already<00:02:02.960> then

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
congestion congested already then

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.080 
congestion congested already then
getting<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.289> nasal<00:02:04.500> passages<00:02:05.100> dry<00:02:05.460> is<00:02:05.520> also

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
getting the nasal passages dry is also

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.930 
getting the nasal passages dry is also
important<00:02:06.569> so<00:02:07.549> we'll<00:02:08.549> look<00:02:08.670> at<00:02:08.789> some

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
important so we'll look at some

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.059 
important so we'll look at some
breathing<00:02:09.269> techniques<00:02:09.720> in<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.929> next<00:02:10.200> clip<00:02:10.470> to

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
breathing techniques in the next clip to

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.150 
breathing techniques in the next clip to
show<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:11.549> how<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.790> do<00:02:12.030> that
