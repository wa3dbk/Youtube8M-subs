00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 one of the most common mistakes in 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.660
 running technique is the so -called 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.780
 sticking is a problem 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.519
 more refers to the girls she has the guys 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.420
 occurs so often enough 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.070
 have a leg poke into the surface instead 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.590
 order to be placed on top and 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.300
 push it is important enough 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.119
 element 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.070
 because it leads to very serious 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.740
 knee injuries but wrong firm 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.679
 before the muscular system is important here is important 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:36.540
 foot folding right 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.219
 staging and repeating the cycle again 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.730
 there is this so-called hawaii 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.320
 wheel 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.079
 let's see how it all happens 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:49.079
 that is, very often running puts the foot 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:51.870
 stick almost all running training days 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.940
 the ball do n't try to stumble but from here 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.210
 going on here going on shock 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.350
 load on the knee and very 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.410
 high probability of inflammatory 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.890
 processes then if you stick it you 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.800
 you make everything a little different 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.180
 leg muscles well and most importantly it 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.670
 inefficient that is on the years on 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.860
 stay on top 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.940
 then going into the grooves push then 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:21.400
 the removal of the cathedrals and that's exactly how it is 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.490
 phases of folding and carrying and again 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.130
 setting foot on the surface 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.740
 the most famous running wheel which 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.510
 forms slender legs forms 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:37.210
 proper muscular system and 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:41.100
 maximum security for you on sevan 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:44.410
 safe and not subject to a second injury 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.930
 running wheel folding rear depends 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.509
 from your speed the faster the higher 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:53.470
 Of course, you understand the heel 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:55.990
 among the river and sprinters are heel fans and 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:00.610
 straight under the buttocks and 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.280
 this is exactly this folding slowly 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.649
 running it all must happen 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:12.539
 most importantly on top or straight for yourself 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:12.539
 still under the projection just a little bit behind
