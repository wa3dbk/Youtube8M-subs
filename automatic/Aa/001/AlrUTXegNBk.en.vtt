00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
be very visible you don't want any harsh

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.160

lines on your nails you just want some

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.110 
lines on your nails you just want some
dimension<00:02:14.950> see<00:02:15.250> and<00:02:15.490> it<00:02:15.670> already<00:02:15.850> looks

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
dimension see and it already looks

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:23.940 
dimension see and it already looks
different<00:02:17.820> and<00:02:19.650> you<00:02:20.650> do<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:20.950> same<00:02:22.470> with<00:02:23.470> the

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
different and you do the same with the

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.550 
different and you do the same with the
ring<00:02:24.100> finger<00:02:26.820> theoretically<00:02:27.820> you<00:02:27.970> could<00:02:28.560> you

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
ring finger theoretically you could you

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:37.320 
ring finger theoretically you could you
could<00:02:29.740> add<00:02:30.010> some<00:02:30.780> matte<00:02:32.400> color<00:02:36.120> instead<00:02:37.120> of

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
could add some matte color instead of

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.180 
could add some matte color instead of
the<00:02:37.620> sheer<00:02:38.620> golden<00:02:39.160> color<00:02:39.400> for<00:02:39.760> example<00:02:41.190> like

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
the sheer golden color for example like

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.170 
the sheer golden color for example like
this<00:02:42.250> one<00:02:42.790> it's<00:02:43.540> quite<00:02:43.900> sure<00:02:44.170> actually<00:02:44.820> but<00:02:45.820> I

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
this one it's quite sure actually but I

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.750 
this one it's quite sure actually but I
feel<00:02:46.630> that<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:47.170> shimmer<00:02:47.680> colors<00:02:48.040> work<00:02:48.400> better

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
feel that the shimmer colors work better

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.640 
feel that the shimmer colors work better
for<00:02:49.150> this<00:02:49.239> purpose<00:02:49.540> is<00:02:49.780> just<00:02:50.020> because<00:02:50.380> there

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
for this purpose is just because there

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.110 
for this purpose is just because there
are<00:02:50.950> less<00:02:51.430> visible<00:02:52.000> and<00:02:52.270> can<00:02:52.660> be<00:02:53.520> blended<00:02:54.520> more

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
are less visible and can be blended more

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.729 
are less visible and can be blended more
easily<00:02:55.630> into<00:02:55.959> your<00:02:55.989> base<00:02:56.820> color<00:02:57.959> so<00:02:58.959> that's<00:02:59.470> it

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
easily into your base color so that's it

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.880 
easily into your base color so that's it
that<00:03:00.100> was<00:03:00.130> my<00:03:00.610> very<00:03:00.970> very<00:03:01.060> quick<00:03:01.570> video<00:03:02.110> and<00:03:02.500> I

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
that was my very very quick video and I

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.370 
that was my very very quick video and I
hope<00:03:02.950> you<00:03:03.550> found<00:03:03.760> it<00:03:03.970> helpful<00:03:04.030> and<00:03:04.660> useful<00:03:04.900> and
