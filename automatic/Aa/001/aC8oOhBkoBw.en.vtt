00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:07.649
 hello everyone here I have a monkey from fettered 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.860
 hunting new series appeared lowest 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:16.460
 price range in such a box 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:20.810
 nuns is here school hunter here 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:24.840
 goose decoy on camping trips and shows 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:28.380
 I'll show you how monkey work 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:32.520
 how do I start now with this here 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.090
 dark here is the orange side completely 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.090
 orange power 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.600
 put off another pocket 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.600
 take another such 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:49.830
 remove this pocket next like this 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.790
 Annushka 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:56.390
 that is surprising to most 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:00.140
 low price range 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:04.500
 itâ€™s not even the sound 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:07.040
 decent tuned goose but also 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:11.220
 on intel yourself you hear 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:14.100
 quite decent himself but work that is 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:20.000
 even at expensive mankov often meets 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:23.190
 Now when you want to develop the velocity is 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.200
 At speeds such there will not slow down 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.110
 find something a little bit stupid 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.840
 starts ie you can't work for 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.640
 full coil what is called 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.020
 that's all the time have to fight as if 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:41.610
 with the same manko that struck me and 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:48.300
 the sound flows from that is all any things 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:53.030
 which are banks here and expensive there everything 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:59.170
 done here is done well if not easier 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:04:02.050
 well I do not know sulking very easily and 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.300
 and it may even be easier to work 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.630
 need to look at the instance 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:12.270
 Here it depends, but here are three semolina from 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:17.680
 boxes and all three works and beyond improve 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:23.530
 just no words now well god forbid that 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:25.600
 that's how it went with my marketing 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.060
 recently appeared so nothing 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:33.250
 I can not say it is clear that they work 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:44.100
 there will be no any 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:44.100
 such now there are decoys on the market for now
