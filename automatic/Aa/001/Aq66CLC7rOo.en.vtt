00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.680
 very good to everyone so that you are 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.510
 we are here in another of my tutorials 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.220
 this time I create this generator 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.019
 automatic carbon in this case is going to be 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.759
 vegetable that as you well know the 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.160
 charcoal is much better more 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.989
 effective for me more effective than the one that 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.399
 normal and good coal takes four 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.079
 gilipolleces with which I will not have 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.790
 no problem can you create it in mode 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.219
 survival and I explain to you as you have already 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.300
 seen in the trailer this what it does is 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.730
 infinitely start to generate us 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.039
 charcoal look I have it 33 and in a 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.710
 second I will have 34 vouchers and so 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.320
 successively it is worth for it we go to 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.320
 need three jumpers a horn 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.329
 as it's own three funnels a 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.640
 rest comparator that is let's say what 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.170
 harder we can get to 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.060
 get in a survival mode because 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.159
 For that, I'm going to put 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.189
 we are quartz but otherwise they are 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.470
 three nonsense of pieces good one 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.210
 reston droplet and obviously the 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.520
 chest that is going to be our storage 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.280
 of this effective and good company I will 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.659
 create it here and I explain it is good if 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.460
 you want me to break this so you can see 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.570
 what it takes but it is so easy 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.710
 that we go I do not believe it myself and good as 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.630
 you can see this what leads us 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.270
 we have worth here we have the clock of 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.509
 comparator the oven that is here is worth 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.250
 I explain it right now in this 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.200
 terrain here so cool I've done 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.119
 ok let's start placing a funnel 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.549
 we will place the funnel looking 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.250
 towards us then we are going to 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.009
 place two up is to press the 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.990
 shift so we can place this 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.270
 up because otherwise it will not leave us 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.099
 place the second then what I say 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.170
 as we will press the shift and it leaves us 

00:01:56.099 --> 00:02:00.209
 press this or do not let this leave 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.400
 upwards it's good then what 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:05.950
 what we do is put a funnel 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.410
 here it is worth but with the yes put ie 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.390
 that is communicated with this 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.090
 welder is worth it then let's continue 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.560
 let's put an oven up here it's worth 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.510
 here is going to be where the oven is going to be 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.180
 and then we will place the other 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:23.230
 funnel here we press the shift as now 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.190
 I tell you if you notice you are directing 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.480
 here 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.580
 another one of the funnels will be looking 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.800
 above the oven if you notice 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.180
 is above the oven and good now 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.830
 Then what we do is put the 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.600
 comparator where as we place the 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.660
 comparator so the oven looking towards 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.120
 opposite then down there it is worth to notice that 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.220
 this continues to there then we're going to 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.080
 put here any block no 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.300
 matter if it is quartz whatever it is worth a 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.840
 block any and here the droplet of 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.690
 reston tachán good next we're going to 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.280
 place here a chest and another chest all 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.580
 this with the shift pressed but as 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.440
 I tell you, it will leave us, it is already 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.000
 we have this you see that easy two minutes 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.920
 backwards I've already said what can you 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.690
 use the survival mode and it works very 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.070
 good and now let's give to give 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.959
 working to this because this 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.270
 it needs functioning so that this 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.440
 work needed 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.440
 tree trunks 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.750
 and charcoal has no more then 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.340
 as we begin to move this as fijaros 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.530
 let's place here at this point 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.469
 whenever I want, I'm going to place the 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.810
 64 wooden jungle then the 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:31.650
 funnel starts to absorb in the oven 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.389
 all the maderita and here in the chest is worth 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.400
 that is our storage because we will 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:37.650
 simply place a coal quoted 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.180
 vegetable so that so I put in 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.129
 operating the oven as you can see 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.019
 now this is working at 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:45.720
 put a coal hundred this and then 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.519
 begins to use it then when it 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.650
 is going to start generating coal here 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.329
 vegetable when this funnel we're 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.329
 seeing here the one under the chest 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:56.730
 be petado of 64 there will come a time that 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:59.159
 is petado of 64 but for it then 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.959
 we have to wait or we can load 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:03.000
 all this is to say we begin to place 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.319
 us the charcoal here but 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.250
 this is already working that is 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.050
 fix 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.670
 you have seen that it has just generated a 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.190
 little cardboard this carboncito 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.010
 general is here I think remember is not 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:18.400
 here and then here you see until you do not 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.440
 fill the oven of 64 veis that is with 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.420
 two fixes worth now will generate one 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.860
 more and it's going to be in three so what 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.190
 You see, I'm going to wait for me because if I do not, 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.190
 you are going to see 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:33.199
 3 you have seen and so up to 64 when 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.970
 it reaches 64, so we'll see more 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:36.410
 little wood here at this point here is 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.620
 where are we going to throw the little flag 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.370
 this obviously place it underground 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:46.030
 I would follow this one 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.030
 in this way sorry here in this way 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:55.050
 you have already seen that it is very simple 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:57.090
 create since it does not take anymore and I've already 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.020
 saying this is going to start storing 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:03.810
 when both the oven is petado 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:06.420
 see, I'm going to fill in the whole 64 and 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.150
 now how do you see padded ssd of 64 here 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:11.100
 in this funnel to start generating 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:16.250
 It is worth looking that there is one you will see from here 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:19.850
 in a moment there will be two a 2 and 3 2 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:22.260
 I've seen and well when this is full 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.830
 that a time will come when it is full 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.180
 because it 's automatic infinite then 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.280
 now it's full what's going to happen now 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.160
 that as there is no other coal goes to 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.470
 go up here to the storage of the chest if I 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:40.140
 I give you there is one and now there are going to be two in 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:41.850
 the 126 and so up to fill everything or 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.010
 be the chest that is a pass 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.600
 whenever we are missing then we come here 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.400
 the funnel and we throw the little 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:51.569
 jungle for each forest jungle 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:53.699
 I want to remember that he creates 8 if they were 8 yes 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:56.069
 that is for each little tree that we let go 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:57.389
 to have 8 charcoal and nothing 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:05:59.189
 guys this is all has no more 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:01.289
 complications is super simple and super 

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:03.360
 effective as I told you to create it in a 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:06.209
 world survival in a survival server 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.770
 it's fucking good, then you can 

00:06:06.209 --> 00:06:10.249
 help me bouncing the little hand up is 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.419
 say a like a like and the truth is that 

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:14.189
 it's going to see a lot more people and it's going to 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:16.169
 generate visits and I'm going to bring 

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:18.029
 many more tutorials and we're all going 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:20.069
 to be very happy today I have here with 

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:21.360
 my last tutorial and nothing guys a 

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:23.639
 I hope you liked it and how 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.080
 I always say a like favorites share
