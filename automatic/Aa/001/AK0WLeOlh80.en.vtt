00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:42.490 
can add 1000 milliseconds to your ping

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.120 
can add 1000 milliseconds to your ping
before<00:03:43.450> the<00:03:43.600> package<00:03:43.959> even<00:03:44.110> gets<00:03:44.470> out<00:03:44.680> of<00:03:44.980> your

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
before the package even gets out of your

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.210 
before the package even gets out of your
network<00:03:45.430> and<00:03:45.790> onto<00:03:46.330> the<00:03:46.420> Internet<00:03:47.010> now<00:03:48.010> it's

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
network and onto the Internet now it's

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.410 
network and onto the Internet now it's
not<00:03:48.340> very<00:03:48.610> often<00:03:48.820> that<00:03:49.000> you're<00:03:49.180> going<00:03:49.330> to

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
not very often that you're going to

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.420 
not very often that you're going to
flood<00:03:49.600> your<00:03:49.750> network<00:03:50.050> like<00:03:50.470> that<00:03:50.709> so<00:03:51.310> let's

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
flood your network like that so let's

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.770 
flood your network like that so let's
take<00:03:51.610> a<00:03:51.640> look<00:03:51.820> at<00:03:51.970> a<00:03:52.000> much<00:03:52.270> more<00:03:52.480> common

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
take a look at a much more common

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.770 
take a look at a much more common
example<00:03:53.670> say<00:03:54.670> you're<00:03:54.820> playing<00:03:54.910> a<00:03:55.090> game<00:03:55.120> and<00:03:55.510> no

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
example say you're playing a game and no

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.120

let out first your game packet is

let out first your game packet is

there's

there's

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.210 
there's
always<00:04:23.659> competing<00:04:24.229> traffic<00:04:24.650> like<00:04:24.830> this<00:04:24.860> on

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
always competing traffic like this on

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.339 
always competing traffic like this on
the<00:04:25.310> network<00:04:25.610> and<00:04:25.819> more<00:04:26.479> often<00:04:26.780> than<00:04:26.930> not<00:04:26.960> it's

00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:27.349 
the network and more often than not it's

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:29.469 
the network and more often than not it's
that<00:04:27.710> competing<00:04:28.190> traffic<00:04:28.610> that<00:04:28.849> causes<00:04:29.240> lag

next video which will show you exactly

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.059 
next video which will show you exactly
how<00:04:35.330> the<00:04:35.509> lag<00:04:35.780> buster<00:04:36.199> gets<00:04:36.409> rid<00:04:36.830> of<00:04:36.860> the

how the lag buster gets rid of the

how the lag buster gets rid of the
funnel<00:04:37.340> problem<00:04:37.699> and<00:04:37.849> in<00:04:38.060> turn<00:04:38.300> eliminates

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
funnel problem and in turn eliminates

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.919 
funnel problem and in turn eliminates
lag<00:04:39.229> from<00:04:39.530> your<00:04:39.680> games
