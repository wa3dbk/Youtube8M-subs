00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:08.050
 Yes Hi everyone Thank you for watching the video 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:13.180
 Today's theme is 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:16.690
 The popular moon hustler exploding in a mini car 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:20.640
 Then Honda of n-box 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:24.530
 n box slash was announced 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:31.460
 Two to here cognitive toll collection 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:33.410
 I'll make a comparison thinking that it would be helpful when I wondered which way to go 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:41.400
 Whats 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:46.630
 Hey first Suzuki Hustler then Honda 's n-box simply specs 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:49.170
 Hustler is better at selling here if you compare 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:53.820
 Overwhelmingly eh 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:01:00.130
 Towards the hustler will raise the tactics weight ones from it 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:01.580
 Even if you look at the fuel efficiency 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:08.620
 Have more of Hustler 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:13.690
 The army goes up, but if you look at the size and breadth, towards n box 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:18.020
 Of course , this will be advantageous. Of course if that size gets bigger and the fuel consumption goes down 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:21.740
 Even though is I'm such a matter of course the others say 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:25.760
 Also as a big feature 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.870
 I think high school one important point, but n box 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:34.300
 Because it becomes a sliding door 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:40.810
 Who Hatsura's luggage when it Daily in a narrow parking lot does not have So the slide 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:45.840
 Even if the door is opened by mistake or when the child accidentally opens the door 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:52.240
 Think there is little danger 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:59.320
 Next to the parking lot I think that things like botun are also reduced One here 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:02:04.510
 In some Kedomo big difference whether I think I know it from the design it is more of a hustler 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:08.140
 There is a design nature and there is something like saying it's fashionable. 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:14.530
 It is a little bit to say when I see this design student 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:18.790
 I think that the preference is divided in the city ​​and then in the rural areas 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:22.370
 Conversely, if you go to the region n box is better 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:26.720
 A lot of parts are out, so it's easy to customize 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:32.239
 I guess it seems to be popular 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:34.230
 Those who have a design or a hustler still have urban parts in the urban area 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:38.220
 Also women 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.630
 It seems like it is a pretty design that is popular 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:47.970
 think 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:52.890
 So far the better of the n box is good if then a say in ride comfort 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:56.590
 It is said that it is like that 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:03:00.569
 I will ride your information all the time 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.569
 I think that is difficult with that child 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:10.360
 In fact, it seems like it won't change so much 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:13.440
 And go in that natural feeling 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.440
 It was Tokari is 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:30.489
 I think Fu that wonder if there is a visit to Korea popular n box in Hatsuhadaka number of wins how 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:30.489
 Thank you for thinking that you can refer to something
