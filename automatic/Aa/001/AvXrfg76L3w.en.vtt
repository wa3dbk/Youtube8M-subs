00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.980
 contacted by afp 

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:14.369
 three boats of this type of dog 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:16.640
 he still appeared superman 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.640
 and it's even more 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:23.839
 transocean the town center 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.359
 the average rise of that 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.570
 while waiting for it to rule for the moment we can say that the substance 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.010
 on the counter 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.680
 in addition that perfect 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.680
 w 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.440
 at three points 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.520
 we wonder how proportion 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:53.970
 It's my aim 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.170
 in the case of saying it 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.750
 this support is from elsewhere 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.460
 the debate around brega the number of dead 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.830
 2 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:04.780
 oracle 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.780
 for example for others is more active 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.780
 many of you who is probably the one who counts 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.580
 but the summer cleric 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.630
 plus it's true 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.960
 we are going 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.960
 the water of the Loire 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.380

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.380
 the 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.410
 team since 2006 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.410
 victim and citigroup 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.270
 the site 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.200
 the results of his investigation 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.200
 head to the match 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.130
 but not question 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.699
 without waiting 

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.699
 relaxed s 

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:20.459
 instead of pulling the skier out of pop culture and then she is a victim 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.359
 write I do not want to think about it that complicates a little more about losing 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:29.109
 the law website 

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:32.749
 they carry well 

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:35.999
 releasable and then all concluded that 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:39.310
 that's why in addition to that I've done quite a bit of time already in the 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:41.889
