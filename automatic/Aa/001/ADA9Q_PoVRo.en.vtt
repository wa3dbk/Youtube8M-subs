00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480
 the lost ones 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:08.240
 welcome let's talk about the six 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.650
 basic tasks your general manager the 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.890
 members of this team are 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:15.470
 we reassure to think about an art carlos 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:18.310
 davis with sage william rendón that 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.710
 dawns in fight 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.250
 the stories of a successful manager 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:27.210
 consists of practically modeling the 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:31.630
 work environment set the strategy 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.570
 assign resources to form genes create the 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:38.080
 organization and supervise cooperation 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.330
 sustained superior performance does not 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.290
 can rest on improvements that make 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.780
 just one time 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.910
 what do you mean we know that currently 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.070
 companies should have an improvement 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.750
 keep going 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.330
 whenever they consider necessary 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.950
 take it to your operations do the 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.950
 improvements that they consider pertinent 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.760
 the first task is to model the environment 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.630
 of work there are legacies of the past 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.740
 that are forming organizational posture 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.890
 we know that the way he has come 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.110
 working the company starts to create 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.479
 by way of reacting to 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.010
 different situations and that starts 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.200
 to happen for management 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.410
 what do I do then the general managers 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.510
 Successful are interested in the model or 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:29.900
 remodel this environment 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:32.060
 as with three fundamental points the 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.760
 first with performance standards 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.980
 what is the quality and effort of the 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.340
 people when a general manager 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.740
 establishes high standards from its management 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.890
 in the same way it moves all the 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.620
 team that sets these standards to all 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.840
 others and precisely the key managers 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.690
 of your company 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.350
 in this way highlight your talent in 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.350
 all the best 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.390
 the second point is how is the company 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.400
 and how it operates from the general manager is 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.270
 establishes three tablets of objectives of 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.789
 the company 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.730
 what should do then have louis 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.790
 clear what is your competence for 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.370
 this way keep motivated all your 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.250
 zone and prepared for structure 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.519
 thus achieving the maximum effort of all 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.519
 the organization 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.650
 for the values ​​of the company and how 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.200
 the successful manager of the team is working 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.170
 in the kind of organization he has is 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.170
 say how you work here for example 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.900
 we see it in google that are spontaneous 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.390
 that many of us already know what their method is 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.550
 of work what is that culture so that 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.450
 all produce in the successful way that 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.010
 they have actually done yourself 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.890
 work to generate managers 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.620
 competent to train them and do 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.690
 planned changes in affect but that 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.970
 all on the contrary generate a 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.420
 commitment of all this team of 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:08.030
 I work like this by acting naturally 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.030
 and in an ethical and equitable way 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.280
 the second in fixing the 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.470
 strategy 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.840
 the manager and you'll see how we know is the 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.990
 responsible for projecting the future of the 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.660
 company to with general manager do 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.910
 successfully this task must count 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.440
 with skills and knowledge 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.950
 special 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.620
 in order to achieve that effort and not 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:38.190
 limited to preside over the execution many 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:41.040
 managers have simply to carry 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.770
 the baton of that orchestra but they do not enter 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.320
 to operations as such is not to give 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:49.560
 know the background ones and that's why many 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:52.620
 Sometimes the idea of putting a 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.470
 strategic vision of every time achieving 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:59.270
 well take all your staff 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.270
 to occupy competitive positions 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.670
 what is then about those skills 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:08.610
 to design that strategy first the 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.380
 market knowledge your manager 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.870
 general should be clear about their 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.660
 target to guarantee the direction of 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.910
 the strategy to be able to train 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.940
 I can study it and transmit it to 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.100
 all your key manager team 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.570
 the second of the knowledge of the 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.030
 competition as we had talked 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.139
 initially of the objectives that it has 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.050

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.099
 constantly your product to add 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.889
 and get me is in front of the 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:40.830
 competition for the generation of 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:44.169

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:47.560

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:49.930
 to place their leading products of 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.479
