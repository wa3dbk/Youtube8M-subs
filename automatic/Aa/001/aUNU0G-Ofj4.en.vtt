going to fall into the carburetor and
we're<00:01:32.450> going<00:01:32.600> to<00:01:32.659> adjust<00:01:32.959> this<00:01:34.360> by<00:01:35.360> just

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
going to have a spring around it sorry

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.779 
going to have a spring around it sorry
you<00:01:44.509> can't<00:01:44.750> see<00:01:45.200> it<00:01:45.319> too<00:01:45.500> well<00:01:45.700> it's<00:01:46.700> gonna

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
you can't see it too well it's gonna

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
have a spring around it and to make it

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.130 
have a spring around it and to make it
go<00:01:50.060> to<00:01:50.619> make<00:01:51.619> it<00:01:51.770> idle<00:01:52.189> I<00:01:52.479> think<00:01:53.479> you<00:01:53.630> have<00:01:53.989> to

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
go to make it idle I think you have to

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.780 
go to make it idle I think you have to
pull<00:01:54.380> it<00:01:54.500> out<00:01:54.590> a<00:01:54.920> little<00:01:55.369> bit

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.140 

like<00:02:01.360> that<00:02:01.570> and<00:02:01.840> it<00:02:01.930> should<00:02:02.110> idle<00:02:02.760> so<00:02:03.760> you<00:02:03.850> can

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
like that and it should idle so you can

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.240 
like that and it should idle so you can
just<00:02:04.330> mess<00:02:05.170> around<00:02:05.200> with<00:02:05.710> it<00:02:05.770> a<00:02:05.950> little<00:02:05.980> bit

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
just mess around with it a little bit

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.990 
just mess around with it a little bit
and<00:02:07.060> since<00:02:07.540> I<00:02:07.720> I<00:02:08.050> want<00:02:08.740> to<00:02:08.979> I<00:02:09.340> kind<00:02:09.610> of<00:02:09.670> I<00:02:09.880> don't

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
and since I I want to I kind of I don't

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.990 
and since I I want to I kind of I don't
like<00:02:10.270> it<00:02:10.450> 3f<00:02:10.840> to<00:02:10.960> keep<00:02:11.080> pumping<00:02:11.260> it<00:02:11.790> so<00:02:12.790> I'm

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
like it 3f to keep pumping it so I'm

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.490 
like it 3f to keep pumping it so I'm
going<00:02:13.180> to<00:02:13.210> make<00:02:13.390> it<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.660> our<00:02:13.690> idols<00:02:14.200> just<00:02:14.410> in

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
going to make it to our idols just in

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.780 
going to make it to our idols just in
case<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:14.770> know<00:02:14.860> if<00:02:14.980> you<00:02:15.040> fall<00:02:15.280> and<00:02:15.460> whatnot

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
case you know if you fall and whatnot

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.430 
case you know if you fall and whatnot
you<00:02:16.000> can<00:02:16.150> get<00:02:16.270> right<00:02:16.420> back<00:02:16.570> up<00:02:16.750> without<00:02:16.960> having

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
you can get right back up without having

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:31.610 
you can get right back up without having
to<00:02:17.560> start<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.310> bike<00:02:18.460> again

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.740 

all<00:02:32.620> right<00:02:33.150> wrong<00:02:34.150> way<00:02:34.709> so<00:02:35.709> now<00:02:36.300> let<00:02:37.300> me<00:02:37.330> screw

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
all right wrong way so now let me screw

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.890 
all right wrong way so now let me screw
it<00:02:37.870> in<00:02:38.489> to<00:02:39.489> make<00:02:39.580> it<00:02:39.640> idle<00:02:40.120> I<00:02:40.300> think<00:02:40.599> that<00:02:40.750> was

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
it in to make it idle I think that was

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.729 
it in to make it idle I think that was
the<00:02:40.989> way<00:02:42.569> screwing<00:02:43.569> it<00:02:43.720> in<00:02:43.870> I<00:02:44.170> think<00:02:44.349> it<00:02:44.620> makes

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
the way screwing it in I think it makes

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.650 
the way screwing it in I think it makes
it<00:02:44.860> idle<00:02:46.739> and<00:02:47.739> I<00:02:47.860> guess<00:02:48.069> I<00:02:48.430> don't<00:02:49.150> know<00:02:49.299> if

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
it idle and I guess I don't know if

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.740 
it idle and I guess I don't know if
you're<00:02:49.930> racing<00:02:50.489> if<00:02:51.489> you<00:02:51.700> want<00:02:51.940> it<00:02:52.060> to<00:02:52.180> idle<00:02:52.599> or

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
you're racing if you want it to idle or

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.360 
you're racing if you want it to idle or
not<00:02:53.280> I'm<00:02:54.280> not<00:02:54.580> sure<00:02:55.480> on<00:02:55.690> that<00:02:56.129> because<00:02:57.129> if<00:02:57.280> you

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
not I'm not sure on that because if you

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.150 
not I'm not sure on that because if you
fall<00:02:57.580> you<00:02:57.879> want<00:02:58.000> your<00:02:58.180> bike<00:02:58.330> to<00:02:58.480> keep<00:02:58.599> running

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
fall you want your bike to keep running

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.030 
fall you want your bike to keep running
but<00:03:00.160> then<00:03:00.340> again<00:03:00.489> I<00:03:01.590> don't<00:03:02.590> know<00:03:02.650> I<00:03:02.680> just<00:03:02.799> I

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
but then again I don't know I just I

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.589 
but then again I don't know I just I
kind<00:03:03.400> of<00:03:03.489> like<00:03:03.640> it<00:03:03.670> so<00:03:03.910> you<00:03:04.000> have<00:03:04.120> to<00:03:04.239> pump<00:03:04.420> it

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
kind of like it so you have to pump it

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.900 
kind of like it so you have to pump it
and<00:03:04.720> keep<00:03:04.870> it<00:03:04.959> revving<00:03:05.290> but<00:03:05.530> I<00:03:05.650> don't<00:03:05.799> know<00:03:05.910> so

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
and keep it revving but I don't know so

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.460 
and keep it revving but I don't know so
I<00:03:06.940> mean<00:03:07.269> I<00:03:07.299> guess<00:03:07.420> it's<00:03:07.750> just<00:03:07.810> up<00:03:08.049> to<00:03:08.079> you<00:03:08.200> and

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
I mean I guess it's just up to you and

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.620 
I mean I guess it's just up to you and
the<00:03:08.560> way<00:03:08.680> you<00:03:08.709> ride<00:03:09.040> but<00:03:09.910> this<00:03:10.150> is<00:03:10.299> just<00:03:10.480> how<00:03:10.599> to

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
the way you ride but this is just how to

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:20.179 
the way you ride but this is just how to
adjust<00:03:10.780> it

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:20.189 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:31.790 

you<00:03:21.189> can<00:03:21.370> email<00:03:21.579> our<00:03:22.650> running<00:03:23.650> back

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:04:00.150 

and

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.920 

so<00:04:01.160> yeah<00:04:01.340> that's<00:04:01.550> pretty<00:04:01.790> simple

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
so yeah that's pretty simple

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.660

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
so that and you can just tune it to

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.800 
so that and you can just tune it to
however<00:04:10.400> you<00:04:10.670> want<00:04:10.910> to<00:04:11.060> if<00:04:11.180> you<00:04:11.299> want<00:04:11.420> revving
