 displayed on a large screen 

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:14.789
 only once again in the framework that we have given and that the eu today with the 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:17.300
 singer presence 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.660
 sooner the dollar too 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.340
 this is what you said a little about the notion of your career as a singer 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.810
 evangelical 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.349
 Mac and specifically firefighters 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.819
 since my parents boyfriend you promised them that they would have 

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:31.690
 sustained 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.080
 who would be a singer 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.140
 and the time has passed and if it has really been fulfilled 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.420
 and I had a small experience not only myself but like my parents too 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.580
 was known as a child singer 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.960
 everyone liked 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.580
 announced for a long time that the singer mirim mirim who would be singing 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.720
 That's because it was too young. I still had no idea of ​​life, right? 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.830
 so I arrived at that church and at the time of singing and simply did not want to 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.000
 sing 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.430
 if it depended on me I will not sing and I did not tell my mother stayed there but 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.020
 even so she did not give up my technique 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.130
 luigi this is how I will fit impossible I knew that one of your 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.740
 larger 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.630
 six senators and his father 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.890
 is that you speak a little about your father's participation in your 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.280
 Ministry 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.620
 my father in december 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.400
 we fight 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.530
 he minister 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.490
 the country in September 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.740
 and sometimes also 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.720
 He's always next year. 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.930
 Thank God 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.990
 the people feel so young but how do you reconcile 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.469
 your adventures and 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:36.480
 with your career 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.370
 it is pretty hard 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.750
 it's just this 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.799
 but I can reconcile to consecrate myself mercy of the Lord 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.440
 but it is difficult by the fact that sometimes even afraid to err us as 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.400
 singers and young people we must give up some things that are difficult but 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.720
 Thank God, I can do it with mercy. 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.430
