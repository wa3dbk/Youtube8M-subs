like<00:06:19.689> me<00:06:19.869> and<00:06:20.050> think<00:06:20.259> that<00:06:20.379> it<00:06:20.529> has<00:06:20.709> to<00:06:20.739> do<00:06:21.039> with

00:06:21.209 --> 00:06:21.219 
like me and think that it has to do with

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:25.049 
like me and think that it has to do with
solder<00:06:21.519> points<00:06:21.819> if<00:06:22.209> you<00:06:23.050> have<00:06:23.379> a<00:06:23.409> vest<00:06:23.739> X<00:06:24.029> 170<00:06:25.029> a

yes it is not a crossfader like the
easier<00:06:28.989> ones<00:06:29.199> that<00:06:29.439> pop<00:06:29.619> off<00:06:29.889> and<00:06:30.129> you<00:06:30.219> could

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:30.399 
easier ones that pop off and you could

00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:31.949 
easier ones that pop off and you could
get<00:06:30.550> to<00:06:30.699> the<00:06:30.819> contacts<00:06:31.269> with<00:06:31.419> an<00:06:31.539> eraser

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:31.959

small brush contact cleaner and spend a
lot<00:06:51.309> of<00:06:51.339> time<00:06:51.639> because<00:06:51.909> I<00:06:52.029> could<00:06:52.239> have<00:06:52.300> even

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:52.449 
lot of time because I could have even

00:06:56.069 --> 00:06:56.079 
touch of static left as you can hear

00:06:56.079 --> 00:06:58.259 
touch of static left as you can hear
them<00:06:56.229> that's<00:06:56.379> what<00:06:56.679> about<00:06:56.919> 5<00:06:57.249> 5<00:06:57.669> 10<00:06:57.879> minutes<00:06:58.149> to

00:06:58.259 --> 00:06:58.269 
them that's what about 5 5 10 minutes to

00:06:58.269 --> 00:07:00.400 
them that's what about 5 5 10 minutes to
scrub<00:06:58.539> it<00:06:58.689> but<00:06:59.499> you<00:06:59.919> know

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:00.410 
scrub it but you know

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.680

if<00:07:00.500> it<00:07:00.710> gets<00:07:00.830> worse<00:07:00.980> again<00:07:01.520> I'll<00:07:02.150> take<00:07:02.390> it<00:07:02.540> out

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:02.690 
if it gets worse again I'll take it out

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.070
