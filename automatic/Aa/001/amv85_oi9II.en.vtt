that<00:02:35.730> as<00:02:35.879> much<00:02:36.030> as<00:02:36.060> I<00:02:36.269> could<00:02:36.349> in<00:02:37.349> my<00:02:37.680> hair<00:02:38.220> I

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
that as much as I could in my hair I

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.670

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.619 
think a year before I even got my dreads
so<00:02:41.310> it's<00:02:41.430> a<00:02:41.489> slow<00:02:41.640> process<00:02:42.120> of<00:02:42.209> purifying

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
so it's a slow process of purifying

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.780 
so it's a slow process of purifying
myself<00:02:43.110> but<00:02:43.349> every<00:02:43.560> day<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:43.920> just<00:02:44.099> try<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.519> live

myself but every day I just try to live

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.360 
myself but every day I just try to live
as<00:02:45.239> pure<00:02:46.140> as<00:02:46.290> possible<00:02:46.349> and<00:02:46.950> as<00:02:47.099> good<00:02:47.250> as
