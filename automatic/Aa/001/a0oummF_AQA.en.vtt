00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:08.580
 what's up with people zero tv with one 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.840
 new video to destiny in the new game 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.120
 Informer video was again 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.330
 interesting information about new ones 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.130
 extension king of the possessed too 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.920
 this time almost the whole thing 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.779
 interview with new gameplay 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.369
 visualizes partially exclusive 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.920
 Gameplay which in the next days 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.590
 not only to stimulate speculation 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.199
 in the background you can see now from us 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.700
 gameplays selected see that before 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.100
 interesting to us in many ways 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.350
 are or maybe even for you 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.600
 we see now is to see the same 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.370
 an automatic rifle apart from that 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.739
 we have clear atypical design 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.480
 visible arcus flashes throughout 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.300
 Flickering and shooting even the 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.039
 entire weapon encase these batteries 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.110
 We know animation in a modified form 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.879
 Form of the exotic was for donald 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.699
 place and at a glance down to the left 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.629
 to weapons not clearly makes clear 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.829
 this is a weapon with arcus 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.239
 elemental damage exactly at this 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.220
 knowledge is then also directly 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.590
 continue because here is the weapon still 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.320
 a tick interesting automatic 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.610
 Rifles are primary weapons primary 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.479
 Weapons have jack in the first one 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.159
 Elementary damage are therefore excluded 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.439
 primary weapon that you either rage 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.820
 get or hold the master version 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.340
 the osiris weapons 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.170
 either it will be possible that 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.450
 some new weapons even without specific 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.850
 activities have elemental damage 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.600
 can do something but actually more 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.250
 is unlikely otherwise a 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.770
 elemental damage upgrade at 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.350
 exotic weapons yes only fair one man 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.060
 you think the hard light is that 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.700
 where do you need it right now? 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.280
 or maybe who knows 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.829
 or you can only get this weapon for 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.240
 very specific activities as well as that 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.490
 already used to 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.259
 apart from elemental damage it would 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.780
 yes absolutely make sense that you are here 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.390
 a new exotic weapon you a lot 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.820
 For example, the design speaks for it 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.950
 the battery animations you so far 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.930
 only when the thunder lord had as well 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.759
 you can see at certain places in the 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.849
 Gameplay that some hits the weapon 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.920
 on more opponents in the form of batteries 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.510
 flash skip in the gameplay 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.400
 jump 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.379
 Although this seems to be only coincidental 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.019
 could be like the exotic 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:20.329
 automatic rifle monte carlo be where the 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:23.209
 ability only in a random way 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:25.159
 moments is activated or the weapon 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.140
 was not completely leveled so that 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:28.790
 the ability is not complete yet 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.069
 was unlocked 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.230
 already in the video about the exotic 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.030
 weapon sleep ac milan was at game 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.180
 informer also gameplay one 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.489
 So basic version presents so one 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.260
 version which has no skills active 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.970
 At least that's not all 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.920
 So it could be good that one 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.890
 insofar that was for all abilities 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.290
 activate these flashes more often 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.049
 more opponents may be distributed 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.269
 also by precision hits or us 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:59.030
 have only a percentage chance here 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:01.730
 on effects just like the monte carlo 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.220
 skills the maligen so a kind of yes 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.790
 From time to time you can say support 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.620
 with cod extension thus the alien mode 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.680
 was there after a few dlcs yes, the synonymous 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.569
 chance an opponent with a knife 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.030
 so to meet aliens and through this 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.940
 Contact arose the like 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.790
 a flash to other nearby enemies 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.099
 is skipped and this either half 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.290
 stunned or directly pressed there was 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:29.269
 By the way, so that you just the 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.609
 ability to have activated and 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.220
 even then there was a cooldown for 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:36.620
 the ability because she was too strong 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.260
 or just would be too strong if the 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.329
 Effect would always come while being there 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.139
 but also has to say that fate 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:46.669
 bring yes with every precision skill 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:48.889
 ultimately enemy groups explode 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:50.750
 does more harm and does too 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:52.940
 reloads even faster 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.889
 not for nothing one of the strongest weapons 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.560
 even if I'm the strongest and best 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:04:00.169
 because legendary but back to 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.150
 mysterious weapon of this anesthetic 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:04.340
 effect becomes straight with groups of opponents 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.069
 really interesting if we use this for 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.599
 short time can be put out of action 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.819
 maybe that's a new one 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:13.310
 ability on this weapon 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:16.430
 is tailored and in so far as this 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.919
 not on no hüther kills or not 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.920
 Hüther hit is fixed 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:24.190
 weapon both in the pv 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:27.070
 be incredibly strong and in pvp 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.110
 just new pvp zones control mode 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.630
 where the opposing team is in groups 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.940
 it will be particularly interesting for 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.640
 Automatik would be with king anyway 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.670
 obsessed and update 2.0 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.260
 because this update will be automatic 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.480
 grant not only improve but 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.670
 generally attractive again and again 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.990
 we would have made more effective 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.200
 in any case, nothing against a new one 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.100
 Automatic would be with elemental damage 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.830
 abilities the hit opponents 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.540
 put out of action for a short time and as 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.910
 addition to other opponents yet 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.670
 skip us, the spark is on 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.230
 jumped every case 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:05.500
 you can play the game you can 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:07.600
 clap or we are incredible 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.330
 curious and looking forward to more 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.190
 info for weapon people as it looks so 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.250
 you're speculating with us in the 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.710
 comments why has this automatic 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.200
 Gun elemental damage could be the weapon 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:23.070
 be exotic and have the logo on the 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.930
 weapon has a meaning about asking questions 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:28.270
 ok people if this video here 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.250
