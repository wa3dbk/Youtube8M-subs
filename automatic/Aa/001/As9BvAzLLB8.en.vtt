playing RPGs I just love getting to see
shit<00:02:21.749> like<00:02:21.780> that<00:02:22.170> but<00:02:22.739> also<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.519> way<00:02:23.639> they<00:02:23.879> use

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
shit like that but also the way they use

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.479 
shit like that but also the way they use
the<00:02:24.299> fanservice<00:02:24.870> it's<00:02:25.200> not<00:02:25.349> so<00:02:25.620> over<00:02:26.099> the<00:02:26.219> top

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
the fanservice it's not so over the top

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.599 
the fanservice it's not so over the top
that<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:26.819> destroys<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:28.260> moments<00:02:28.799> or<00:02:28.950> the

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:29.609 
that it destroys the moments or the

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:31.849 
that it destroys the moments or the
story<00:02:30.000> or<00:02:30.299> the<00:02:30.329> progression<00:02:31.049> of<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.379> episode

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:31.859 
story or the progression of the episode

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.129 
story or the progression of the episode
so<00:02:31.889> the<00:02:32.219> way<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.609> fanservice<00:02:33.209> is<00:02:33.450> spread<00:02:33.900> out

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:34.139 
so the way the fanservice is spread out

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:36.410 
so the way the fanservice is spread out
throughout<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.650> entire<00:02:34.859> episode<00:02:35.760> or<00:02:35.939> series

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
throughout the entire episode or series

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.839 
throughout the entire episode or series
I'm<00:02:36.959> enjoying<00:02:37.469> that<00:02:37.739> aspect<00:02:38.219> too<00:02:38.459> because<00:02:38.730> it

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
I'm enjoying that aspect too because it

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.369 
I'm enjoying that aspect too because it
doesn't<00:02:39.150> feel<00:02:39.269> like<00:02:39.450> it's<00:02:39.629> just<00:02:39.750> being<00:02:39.959> forced

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
doesn't feel like it's just being forced

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:41.959 
doesn't feel like it's just being forced
into<00:02:40.530> my<00:02:40.680> face<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:41.280> I'm<00:02:41.489> having<00:02:41.669> to<00:02:41.819> watch

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
familiar that this girl is a part of is

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.580 
familiar that this girl is a part of is
having<00:05:23.970> issues<00:05:24.180> I'm<00:05:24.509> guessing<00:05:24.840> financial

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
having issues I'm guessing financial

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.740 
having issues I'm guessing financial
issues<00:05:26.039> and<00:05:26.280> they're<00:05:26.759> scrambling<00:05:27.180> around<00:05:27.479> for

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
issues and they're scrambling around for

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.330 
issues and they're scrambling around for
money<00:05:28.050> they<00:05:28.229> need<00:05:28.409> money<00:05:28.650> they<00:05:28.770> need<00:05:29.039> a<00:05:29.070> lot<00:05:29.310> of

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
money they need money they need a lot of

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.339 
money they need money they need a lot of
money<00:05:29.580> and<00:05:29.880> we<00:05:30.509> don't<00:05:30.690> know<00:05:30.810> the<00:05:30.960> reason<00:05:31.229> why

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:31.349 
money and we don't know the reason why

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:33.230 
money and we don't know the reason why
but<00:05:31.590> they<00:05:31.680> need<00:05:31.860> money<00:05:32.099> so<00:05:32.400> probably

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
but they need money so probably

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.610 
but they need money so probably
something<00:05:33.570> very<00:05:33.599> bad<00:05:33.990> is<00:05:34.020> going<00:05:34.349> on<00:05:34.470> like<00:05:34.560> a

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
something very bad is going on like a

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.020 
something very bad is going on like a
debt<00:05:34.949> or<00:05:35.190> something<00:05:35.520> like<00:05:35.669> that<00:05:35.820> that<00:05:35.940> could

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
debt or something like that that could

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.460 
debt or something like that that could
probably<00:05:36.330> destroy<00:05:36.539> the<00:05:36.659> entire<00:05:36.870> Familia<00:05:37.320> and

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
probably destroy the entire Familia and

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.379 
probably destroy the entire Familia and
I'm<00:05:37.949> willing<00:05:38.250> to<00:05:38.370> bet<00:05:38.520> that<00:05:38.729> this<00:05:38.849> girl<00:05:39.120> that's

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:39.389 
I'm willing to bet that this girl that's

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:40.760 
I'm willing to bet that this girl that's
