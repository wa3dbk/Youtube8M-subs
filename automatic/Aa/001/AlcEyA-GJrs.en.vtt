of pace but i'd assume that he still
goes<00:01:25.380> for<00:01:25.650> absolutely<00:01:26.189> nothing<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.729> again<00:01:27.090> we

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
goes for absolutely nothing and again we

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.569 
goes for absolutely nothing and again we
get<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.780> good<00:01:28.140> contract<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.890> fitnesses<00:01:29.369> and

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
get a good contract and fitnesses and

quite<00:01:55.750> interesting<00:01:56.380> to<00:01:56.410> make<00:01:56.590> a<00:01:56.620> squad

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
quite interesting to make a squad

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.620 
quite interesting to make a squad
builder<00:01:57.310> around<00:01:57.610> just<00:01:57.850> because<00:01:57.940> I<00:01:58.120> find<00:01:58.450> him

things you get a free pack as well but

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.110 
things you get a free pack as well but
there<00:02:32.770> yeah<00:02:33.130> I<00:02:33.160> have<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.490> say<00:02:33.610> that<00:02:33.820> is<00:02:33.940> the

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
there yeah I have to say that is the

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.780 
there yeah I have to say that is the
best<00:02:34.210> pack<00:02:34.480> that<00:02:34.660> I've<00:02:34.780> had<00:02:34.990> in<00:02:35.320> in<00:02:35.800> 15<00:02:36.190> so<00:02:36.580> far

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
best pack that I've had in in 15 so far

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.000 
best pack that I've had in in 15 so far
so<00:02:37.090> that<00:02:37.630> is<00:02:37.810> one<00:02:38.020> positive<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.680> come<00:02:38.800> out<00:02:38.920> of

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
so that is one positive to come out of

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.880 
so that is one positive to come out of
this<00:02:39.070> pack<00:02:39.310> opening<00:02:39.760> we<00:02:40.120> didn't<00:02:40.420> even<00:02:40.890> mm

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
this pack opening we didn't even mm

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.770 
this pack opening we didn't even mm
probably<00:02:42.310> barely<00:02:42.730> made<00:02:43.030> money<00:02:43.270> back<00:02:43.480> on<00:02:43.510> the

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
probably barely made money back on the

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.870 
probably barely made money back on the
package<00:02:44.200> say<00:02:44.440> that<00:02:44.740> wouldn't<00:02:45.340> when<00:02:45.550> you<00:02:45.640> sell

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
package say that wouldn't when you sell

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.000 
package say that wouldn't when you sell
everything<00:02:46.390> for<00:02:46.870> them<00:02:47.080> I<00:02:47.410> don't<00:02:47.740> really<00:02:47.830> know

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
everything for them I don't really know

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.320 
everything for them I don't really know
how<00:02:48.100> much<00:02:48.250> maratha<00:02:48.580> is<00:02:48.790> going<00:02:49.000> for<00:02:49.180> I'd

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
how much maratha is going for I'd

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.910 
how much maratha is going for I'd
imagine<00:02:49.810> though<00:02:49.930> that<00:02:50.140> it's<00:02:50.260> not<00:02:50.440> a<00:02:50.470> whole<00:02:50.680> lot

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
imagine though that it's not a whole lot

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.040 
imagine though that it's not a whole lot
all<00:02:51.280> right<00:02:51.430> let's<00:02:51.850> go<00:02:52.000> again<00:02:52.300> see<00:02:52.750> if<00:02:52.840> we<00:02:52.870> can

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
all right let's go again see if we can

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.960 
all right let's go again see if we can
improve<00:02:53.350> on<00:02:53.650> that<00:02:53.680> last<00:02:54.040> bit<00:02:54.280> of<00:02:54.340> look<00:02:54.580> that<00:02:54.850> we

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
improve on that last bit of look that we

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.490 
improve on that last bit of look that we
had<00:02:55.120> because<00:02:55.420> that<00:02:55.600> was<00:02:55.750> a<00:02:55.780> very<00:02:56.080> very<00:02:56.260> good

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
had because that was a very very good

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.600 
had because that was a very very good
