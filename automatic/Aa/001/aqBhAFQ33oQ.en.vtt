00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.970 

I<00:00:04.520> kind<00:00:05.520> of<00:00:05.549> like<00:00:05.700> it<00:00:05.730> inside<00:00:06.210> like<00:00:06.480> that<00:00:06.980> so

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
I kind of like it inside like that so

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.169 
I kind of like it inside like that so
rather<00:00:08.160> than<00:00:08.280> taking<00:00:08.490> it<00:00:08.639> out<00:00:08.790> I<00:00:08.820> think<00:00:09.090> I'm

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
rather than taking it out I think I'm

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.129 
rather than taking it out I think I'm
just<00:00:09.360> going<00:00:09.540> to<00:00:10.280> find<00:00:11.280> my<00:00:11.490> wire<00:00:11.790> pull<00:00:12.630> it<00:00:12.780> on

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
just going to find my wire pull it on

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.080 
just going to find my wire pull it on
the<00:00:13.170> wire<00:00:14.839> now<00:00:15.839> this<00:00:16.080> will<00:00:16.260> help<00:00:16.500> cut<00:00:17.460> all<00:00:17.850> of

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
the wire now this will help cut all of

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.679 
the wire now this will help cut all of
my<00:00:18.210> mechanics<00:00:18.359> or<00:00:19.050> my<00:00:19.170> stems<00:00:20.270> if<00:00:21.270> that's<00:00:21.510> not

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
my mechanics or my stems if that's not

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.300 
my mechanics or my stems if that's not
enough<00:00:21.990> I'll<00:00:22.140> have<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.380> add<00:00:22.500> either<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:22.980> flower

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
enough I'll have to add either a flower

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.830 
enough I'll have to add either a flower
or<00:00:23.609> another<00:00:23.820> piece<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.119> ribbon<00:00:26.630> so<00:00:27.630> now<00:00:27.779> you

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
or another piece of ribbon so now you

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.150 
or another piece of ribbon so now you
can<00:00:27.960> see<00:00:28.109> if<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.260> have<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.439> gap<00:00:28.650> here<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:28.949> want

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
can see if I have a gap here and I want

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.529 
can see if I have a gap here and I want
something<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:29.400> can<00:00:29.519> put<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.670> piece<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:29.970> ribbon<00:00:30.269> or

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
something I can put a piece of ribbon or

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.229 
something I can put a piece of ribbon or
I<00:00:31.260> could<00:00:31.590> go<00:00:31.679> back<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.070> add<00:00:32.219> another<00:00:32.910> flower

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
I could go back and add another flower

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.260 
I could go back and add another flower
just<00:00:33.780> depending<00:00:34.140> on<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.910> look<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.239> want

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
just depending on the look that you want

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.850 
just depending on the look that you want
so<00:00:36.930> now<00:00:36.960> we're<00:00:37.260> starting<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.620> add<00:00:37.800> our<00:00:37.950> ribbon

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
so now we're starting to add our ribbon

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.510 
so now we're starting to add our ribbon
now<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:40.920> could<00:00:41.160> also<00:00:41.399> use<00:00:42.440> the<00:00:43.440> crinoline<00:00:43.890> and

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
now you could also use the crinoline and

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.160 
now you could also use the crinoline and
with<00:00:45.120> your<00:00:45.300> ribbon<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.629> doesn't<00:00:45.870> have<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.079> be

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
with your ribbon it doesn't have to be

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.990 
with your ribbon it doesn't have to be
instead<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.649> your<00:00:46.770> ribbon<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.430> can<00:00:47.579> add<00:00:47.760> some

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
instead of your ribbon you can add some

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.209 
instead of your ribbon you can add some
crinoline<00:00:48.420> it's<00:00:48.629> just<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.899> netting<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.500> you

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
crinoline it's just a netting that you

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.069 
crinoline it's just a netting that you
can<00:00:50.370> make<00:00:50.520> some<00:00:50.730> loops<00:00:50.969> this<00:00:51.629> would<00:00:51.809> be<00:00:51.899> pretty

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
can make some loops this would be pretty

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.209 
can make some loops this would be pretty
to<00:00:52.289> add<00:00:52.440> make<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.190> couple<00:00:53.489> loops<00:00:53.789> here<00:00:55.219> gather

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
to add make a couple loops here gather

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.750 
to add make a couple loops here gather
it<00:00:56.370> with<00:00:56.460> wire<00:00:56.809> that<00:00:57.809> could<00:00:58.140> be<00:00:58.440> added<00:00:59.250> even

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
it with wire that could be added even

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.610 
it with wire that could be added even
behind<00:01:00.239> everything<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:01.170> give<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.440> little

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
behind everything to give you a little

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.030 
behind everything to give you a little
hype<00:01:02.449> you<00:01:03.449> could<00:01:03.629> add<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.899> in<00:01:04.019> orange<00:01:04.290> you

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
hype you could add it in orange you

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.130 
hype you could add it in orange you
could<00:01:05.220> do<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.519> yellow<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.390> just<00:01:06.600> depends<00:01:07.049> on

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
could do the yellow it just depends on

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.880 
could do the yellow it just depends on
what<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.189> like<00:01:08.240> personal<00:01:09.240> preference<00:01:09.890> we

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
what you like personal preference we

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.620 
what you like personal preference we
also<00:01:11.100> have<00:01:11.460> some<00:01:11.700> netting<00:01:12.090> that's<00:01:12.240> easy<00:01:12.450> to

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
also have some netting that's easy to

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.469 
also have some netting that's easy to
work<00:01:12.810> with<00:01:13.189> it<00:01:14.189> does<00:01:14.520> not<00:01:14.700> have<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:14.970> wire<00:01:15.210> but

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
work with it does not have a wire but

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.320 
work with it does not have a wire but
it's<00:01:15.600> very<00:01:16.130> flexible<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.759> it's<00:01:17.880> easy<00:01:18.150> to

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
it's very flexible so it's easy to

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.120 
it's very flexible so it's easy to
gather<00:01:20.960> again<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.409> don't<00:01:22.560> have<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.830> make<00:01:22.950> your

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
gather again you don't have to make your

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.440 
gather again you don't have to make your
loops<00:01:23.280> even<00:01:23.670> if<00:01:23.790> anything<00:01:24.150> you're<00:01:24.270> going<00:01:24.390> to

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
loops even if anything you're going to

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.649 
loops even if anything you're going to
try<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.689> make<00:01:24.869> them<00:01:25.020> not<00:01:25.229> even<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:26.509> that<00:01:27.509> we

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
try to make them not even and that we

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.960 
try to make them not even and that we
could<00:01:27.780> also<00:01:28.020> put<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.470> wire<00:01:28.680> around<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.340> that

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
could also put a wire around and that

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.539 
could also put a wire around and that
would<00:01:30.090> be<00:01:30.210> very<00:01:30.390> pretty<00:01:30.630> tucked<00:01:31.549> behind

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
would be very pretty tucked behind

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.499 
would be very pretty tucked behind
everything<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:34.670> think<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.880> kind<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.119> like<00:01:36.299> that

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
everything I think I kind of like that

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.630 
everything I think I kind of like that
when<00:01:36.689> I'm<00:01:36.780> going<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.960> use<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:37.350> one

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.109 

so<00:01:41.640> I've<00:01:42.150> got<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.329> piece<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.720> maybe<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.049> yard<00:01:44.119> make

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
so I've got a piece of maybe a yard make

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.840 
so I've got a piece of maybe a yard make
a<00:01:45.149> loop<00:01:45.710> I'm<00:01:46.710> going<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.920> gather<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.490> between

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
a loop I'm going to gather that between

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.980 
a loop I'm going to gather that between
my<00:01:48.000> fingers<00:01:50.210> put<00:01:51.210> up<00:01:51.329> here<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.689> can<00:01:51.780> see<00:01:51.960> a

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
my fingers put up here so you can see a

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.990 
my fingers put up here so you can see a
little<00:01:52.110> better<00:01:52.850> and<00:01:53.850> then<00:01:54.630> make<00:01:54.899> another<00:01:55.170> loop

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
little better and then make another loop

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.160 
little better and then make another loop
doesn't<00:01:58.000> have<00:01:58.090> to<00:01:58.149> be<00:01:58.299> perfect<00:01:58.810> we're<00:01:59.020> going

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
doesn't have to be perfect we're going

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.639 
doesn't have to be perfect we're going
to<00:01:59.229> and<00:02:00.450> then<00:02:01.450> another<00:02:01.689> one<00:02:04.170> use<00:02:05.170> your<00:02:05.350> covered

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
to and then another one use your covered

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:13.140 
to and then another one use your covered
wire<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:07.000> hold<00:02:07.149> it<00:02:07.329> all<00:02:07.420> together<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:12.150> then

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
wire to hold it all together and then

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.470 
wire to hold it all together and then
cut<00:02:13.390> off<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.510> excess<00:02:13.660> wire<00:02:15.209> let<00:02:16.209> out<00:02:16.390> of<00:02:16.420> the

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
cut off the excess wire let out of the

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.809 
cut off the excess wire let out of the
way<00:02:19.530> now<00:02:20.530> if<00:02:20.769> you<00:02:20.860> look<00:02:21.069> the<00:02:21.280> hat<00:02:21.459> in<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.670> back

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
way now if you look the hat in the back

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.640 
way now if you look the hat in the back
you<00:02:22.030> can<00:02:22.120> see<00:02:22.180> all<00:02:22.630> my<00:02:22.690> stems<00:02:23.140> are<00:02:23.319> glue<00:02:23.530> are

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
you can see all my stems are glue are

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.949 
you can see all my stems are glue are
showing<00:02:24.040> so<00:02:24.970> that's<00:02:25.150> what<00:02:25.360> we<00:02:25.450> need<00:02:25.630> to<00:02:25.780> hide

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
showing so that's what we need to hide

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.500 
showing so that's what we need to hide
and<00:02:26.200> cover<00:02:26.290> up<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:27.220> that's<00:02:27.549> what<00:02:27.879> this<00:02:28.090> you

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
and cover up and that's what this you

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.089 
and cover up and that's what this you
have<00:02:28.599> two<00:02:28.810> choices<00:02:29.110> you<00:02:29.319> can<00:02:29.440> let<00:02:29.680> your<00:02:29.830> ribbon

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
have two choices you can let your ribbon

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.089 
have two choices you can let your ribbon
cover<00:02:30.340> part<00:02:30.640> of<00:02:30.730> it<00:02:30.880> and<00:02:31.500> my<00:02:32.500> netting<00:02:32.830> is<00:02:32.950> going

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
cover part of it and my netting is going

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.460 
cover part of it and my netting is going
to<00:02:33.160> go<00:02:33.310> in<00:02:33.489> and<00:02:33.760> cover<00:02:33.910> most<00:02:34.150> of<00:02:34.360> it<00:02:34.510> so<00:02:35.079> we're

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
to go in and cover most of it so we're

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:43.319 
to go in and cover most of it so we're
going<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.620> put<00:02:35.799> some<00:02:35.980> wire<00:02:36.160> again<00:02:36.430> on<00:02:42.329> okay

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
going to put some wire again on okay

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.900 
going to put some wire again on okay
we're<00:02:43.540> going<00:02:43.660> to<00:02:43.720> put<00:02:43.870> some<00:02:44.099> glue<00:02:45.099> again<00:02:45.790> on

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
we're going to put some glue again on

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.789 
we're going to put some glue again on
the<00:02:45.970> wire<00:02:46.120> and<00:02:46.569> see<00:02:46.780> about<00:02:47.019> a<00:02:47.079> little<00:02:47.440> little

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
the wire and see about a little little

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.120 
the wire and see about a little little
dollop<00:02:48.310> about<00:02:48.579> size<00:02:49.450> of<00:02:49.569> a<00:02:49.630> dime<00:02:49.810> and<00:02:50.130> then

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
dollop about size of a dime and then

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.250 
dollop about size of a dime and then
come<00:02:51.430> in<00:02:51.549> here<00:02:54.780> inside<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:55.930> design<00:02:56.049> you're

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
come in here inside the design you're

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.440 
come in here inside the design you're
going<00:02:56.380> to<00:02:56.440> kind<00:02:56.500> of<00:02:56.590> push<00:02:56.799> it<00:02:56.829> in<00:02:57.069> so<00:02:57.450> it's

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
going to kind of push it in so it's

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.520 
going to kind of push it in so it's
behind<00:02:58.720> your<00:02:58.959> flowers<00:03:01.139> again<00:03:02.139> you<00:03:02.260> have<00:03:02.410> to

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
behind your flowers again you have to

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.069 
behind your flowers again you have to
hold<00:03:02.680> it<00:03:02.769> for<00:03:02.829> about<00:03:02.980> 15<00:03:03.819> seconds<00:03:04.239> or<00:03:04.480> a<00:03:04.510> pop

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
hold it for about 15 seconds or a pop

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:08.520 
hold it for about 15 seconds or a pop
back<00:03:05.290> out<00:03:05.470> again<00:03:05.650> and<00:03:06.870> then<00:03:07.870> you<00:03:07.959> can<00:03:08.139> see<00:03:08.350> from

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
back out again and then you can see from

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.809 
back out again and then you can see from
the<00:03:08.620> front<00:03:08.769> that<00:03:08.950> that's<00:03:09.160> going<00:03:09.340> to<00:03:09.400> stick<00:03:09.670> up

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
the front that that's going to stick up

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.620 
the front that that's going to stick up
ahead<00:03:10.120> above<00:03:10.750> everything<00:03:12.120> sometimes<00:03:13.120> I<00:03:13.420> like

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
ahead above everything sometimes I like

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.449 
ahead above everything sometimes I like
to<00:03:13.959> go<00:03:14.230> back<00:03:14.380> in<00:03:14.560> here<00:03:14.769> and<00:03:14.889> add<00:03:15.040> a<00:03:15.069> little<00:03:15.310> bit

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
to go back in here and add a little bit

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:16.710 
to go back in here and add a little bit
of<00:03:15.549> the<00:03:15.970> netting<00:03:16.269> I'll<00:03:16.420> show<00:03:16.540> you<00:03:16.600> what<00:03:16.690> that

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
of the netting I'll show you what that

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.190 
of the netting I'll show you what that
looks<00:03:16.989> like<00:03:17.790> just<00:03:18.790> about<00:03:18.970> maybe<00:03:19.239> 12<00:03:19.810> inches<00:03:20.139> of

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
looks like just about maybe 12 inches of

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.319 
looks like just about maybe 12 inches of
netting<00:03:23.430> this<00:03:24.430> is<00:03:24.579> what's<00:03:24.730> in<00:03:24.910> doesn't<00:03:25.299> have

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
netting this is what's in doesn't have

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:30.449 
netting this is what's in doesn't have
to<00:03:25.510> be<00:03:25.630> all<00:03:25.840> one<00:03:26.230> bow<00:03:26.560> it's<00:03:27.160> very<00:03:27.459> easy<00:03:27.819> to<00:03:29.459> loop

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
to be all one bow it's very easy to loop

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.879 
to be all one bow it's very easy to loop
it<00:03:30.609> in<00:03:30.760> half<00:03:31.030> or<00:03:31.660> take<00:03:32.200> it<00:03:32.350> and<00:03:32.440> fold<00:03:32.560> it<00:03:32.769> in

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
it in half or take it and fold it in

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:42.830 
it in half or take it and fold it in
half<00:03:32.920> and<00:03:33.569> add<00:03:34.569> extra<00:03:35.410> loops<00:03:35.650> to<00:03:36.430> your<00:03:36.579> design

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.360 

so<00:03:43.840> now<00:03:44.139> to<00:03:44.200> see<00:03:44.440> if<00:03:44.530> I'm<00:03:44.650> going<00:03:44.799> to<00:03:44.859> like<00:03:45.069> this

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
so now to see if I'm going to like this

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.599 
so now to see if I'm going to like this
I'm<00:03:46.090> going<00:03:46.510> to<00:03:46.569> tuck<00:03:46.840> it<00:03:46.959> in<00:03:47.139> I<00:03:47.380> can<00:03:48.370> already

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
I'm going to tuck it in I can already

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:50.640 
I'm going to tuck it in I can already
tell<00:03:48.849> you<00:03:49.000> it<00:03:49.060> can<00:03:49.420> be<00:03:49.510> a<00:03:49.540> little<00:03:49.660> too<00:03:49.959> sticky

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
tell you it can be a little too sticky

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.319 
tell you it can be a little too sticky
out<00:03:50.889> from<00:03:51.130> it<00:03:51.340> I'm<00:03:51.519> going<00:03:51.700> to<00:03:51.760> go<00:03:51.849> back<00:03:52.030> and

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
out from it I'm going to go back and

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.180 
out from it I'm going to go back and
make<00:03:53.049> it<00:03:53.079> a<00:03:53.200> little<00:03:53.319> smaller<00:03:53.709> and<00:03:54.040> the<00:03:54.099> way

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
make it a little smaller and the way

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.379 
make it a little smaller and the way
that<00:03:54.370> I<00:03:54.430> do<00:03:54.489> that<00:03:54.730> I<00:03:54.790> don't<00:03:54.940> have<00:03:55.000> to<00:03:55.120> take<00:03:55.269> it

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:55.389 
that I do that I don't have to take it

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:57.870 
that I do that I don't have to take it
apart<00:03:55.799> I'm<00:03:56.799> just<00:03:57.069> going<00:03:57.190> to<00:03:57.220> put<00:03:57.370> another<00:03:57.639> wire

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
apart I'm just going to put another wire

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.870 
apart I'm just going to put another wire
little<00:03:58.180> further<00:03:58.389> up<00:03:58.630> that<00:03:59.430> will<00:04:00.430> make<00:04:00.579> my<00:04:00.700> bow

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
little further up that will make my bow

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.280 
little further up that will make my bow
smaller<00:04:01.299> or<00:04:01.599> my<00:04:01.720> loops<00:04:01.989> smaller

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
smaller or my loops smaller

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.040 
smaller or my loops smaller
and<00:04:03.410> then<00:04:03.860> cut<00:04:04.190> all<00:04:04.340> that<00:04:04.489> off<00:04:04.720> so<00:04:05.720> now<00:04:05.870> I<00:04:05.900> have

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
and then cut all that off so now I have

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.589 
and then cut all that off so now I have
a<00:04:06.080> little<00:04:06.290> smaller<00:04:06.620> loop<00:04:07.209> sometimes<00:04:08.209> I'll<00:04:08.450> put

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
a little smaller loop sometimes I'll put

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.350 
a little smaller loop sometimes I'll put
a<00:04:08.660> little<00:04:08.870> glue<00:04:09.110> right<00:04:09.379> here<00:04:09.410> to<00:04:09.800> hold<00:04:10.360> that

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
a little glue right here to hold that

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.850 
a little glue right here to hold that
wire<00:04:11.720> onto<00:04:12.080> the<00:04:12.379> netting<00:04:12.739> so<00:04:13.400> it<00:04:13.700> doesn't<00:04:14.150> slip

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
wire onto the netting so it doesn't slip

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.430 
wire onto the netting so it doesn't slip
and<00:04:15.860> I<00:04:15.890> can<00:04:16.070> also<00:04:16.190> use<00:04:16.370> that<00:04:16.730> to<00:04:16.850> glue<00:04:17.030> it<00:04:17.120> in

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
and I can also use that to glue it in

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.699 
and I can also use that to glue it in
tuck<00:04:18.440> it<00:04:18.590> way<00:04:18.739> down<00:04:19.070> in<00:04:19.280> there<00:04:20.500> again<00:04:21.500> it<00:04:21.620> helps

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
tuck it way down in there again it helps

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.600 
tuck it way down in there again it helps
cover<00:04:22.130> the<00:04:22.280> mechanics<00:04:22.700> in<00:04:22.820> there<00:04:22.940> also<00:04:24.610> and

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
cover the mechanics in there also and

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.129 
cover the mechanics in there also and
that<00:04:25.729> adds<00:04:25.970> a<00:04:26.090> little<00:04:26.330> different<00:04:26.780> texture

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
that adds a little different texture

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:31.420 
that adds a little different texture
amongst<00:04:27.770> your<00:04:27.889> flowers<00:04:29.350> and<00:04:30.350> again<00:04:30.620> go<00:04:31.220> to<00:04:31.280> the

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
want to go on and use some of these

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.520 
want to go on and use some of these
extra<00:04:47.419> flowers<00:04:47.660> I<00:04:47.810> think<00:04:47.960> I<00:04:47.990> have<00:04:48.139> some<00:04:48.320> buds

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
that I could use this would be a good

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.250 
that I could use this would be a good
time<00:04:51.590> to<00:04:51.740> go<00:04:51.860> back<00:04:52.070> and<00:04:52.340> add<00:04:52.550> a<00:04:52.970> couple<00:04:53.960> buds

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
time to go back and add a couple buds

little bud and let's see we can add

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:21.490 
little bud and let's see we can add
another<00:05:19.389> just<00:05:20.389> keep<00:05:20.570> playing<00:05:20.780> around<00:05:21.110> until

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
another just keep playing around until

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.610 
another just keep playing around until

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
you find a good place or throw it away

you find a good place or throw it away
you<00:05:24.979> don't<00:05:25.430> have<00:05:25.669> to<00:05:25.789> use<00:05:25.910> every<00:05:26.210> flower<00:05:26.450> it

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
you don't have to use every flower it

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:28.690 
you don't have to use every flower it
might<00:05:27.560> sometimes<00:05:27.979> it's<00:05:28.130> better<00:05:28.280> off<00:05:28.430> if<00:05:28.580> you

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
might sometimes it's better off if you

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.779 
there's my design now I can add one more
element<00:06:07.250> I<00:06:07.820> could<00:06:08.450> go<00:06:08.570> back<00:06:08.750> and<00:06:09.400> add<00:06:10.400> feathers
