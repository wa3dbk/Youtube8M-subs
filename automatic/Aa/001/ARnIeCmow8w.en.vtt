seaweed that believes our Cleveland

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.230 
seaweed that believes our Cleveland
believes<00:00:18.160> part<00:00:18.699> of<00:00:18.789> the<00:00:18.880> reason<00:00:19.090> that<00:00:19.150> they

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.240 
believes part of the reason that they

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.359 
believes part of the reason that they
drained<00:00:19.449> it<00:00:19.600> I'm<00:00:19.810> not<00:00:19.990> sure<00:00:20.050> on<00:00:20.410> that<00:00:20.439> one<00:00:20.619> they

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369 
drained it I'm not sure on that one they

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.390 
drained it I'm not sure on that one they
are<00:00:21.460> for<00:00:21.640> sure<00:00:21.669> repairing<00:00:22.119> the<00:00:22.210> dam<00:00:22.390> so<00:00:23.400> the

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
are for sure repairing the dam so the

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.919 
are for sure repairing the dam so the
lake<00:00:24.550> strains<00:00:24.970> I'm<00:00:25.150> actually<00:00:25.300> walking<00:00:25.630> where

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:25.929 
lake strains I'm actually walking where

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:29.040 
lake strains I'm actually walking where
water<00:00:26.820> used<00:00:27.820> to<00:00:27.970> be<00:00:28.119> it's<00:00:28.539> been<00:00:28.689> draining<00:00:28.900> for

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
water used to be it's been draining for

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.359 
water used to be it's been draining for
a<00:00:29.079> little<00:00:29.230> while<00:00:29.349> now<00:00:29.529> I'm<00:00:29.710> not<00:00:29.949> exactly<00:00:30.189> sure

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
a little while now I'm not exactly sure

a little while now I'm not exactly sure
how<00:00:30.489> long<00:00:30.869> it's<00:00:31.869> still<00:00:32.110> pretty<00:00:32.349> muddy<00:00:32.920> in

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
how long it's still pretty muddy in

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.569 
how long it's still pretty muddy in
spots

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:33.579 
spots

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.590

I<00:00:33.780> guess<00:00:35.129> people<00:00:36.129> come<00:00:36.340> out<00:00:36.430> here<00:00:36.609> and<00:00:36.730> sink

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
I guess people come out here and sink

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.349 
I guess people come out here and sink
like<00:00:38.199> over<00:00:38.859> five<00:00:39.070> feet<00:00:39.250> and<00:00:39.760> they'd<00:00:40.149> have<00:00:40.329> to

00:00:40.349 --> 00:00:40.359 
like over five feet and they'd have to

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:44.610 
like over five feet and they'd have to
call<00:00:41.070> for<00:00:42.070> help<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:43.289> guess<00:00:44.289> -<00:00:44.410> the<00:00:44.500> fire

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
call for help I guess - the fire

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:45.660 
call for help I guess - the fire
