 hooded ferrymen who never show themselves in the face and who are 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.900
 so many even about thirty sixty people already appear 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.930
 accompanying the various groups, I am sure to ask you these women 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.930

 many days of waiting in rooms that have passed and maybe in a room with a bathroom 

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:49.689
 only but without knowing what will become of them then someone comes to take them 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:54.719

 take off your shoes to enter the water must do very quickly 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.840

 if you are in 40-bed rooms, community times access the original set times 

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:13.439
