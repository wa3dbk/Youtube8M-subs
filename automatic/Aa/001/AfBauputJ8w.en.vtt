00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
the outer skirts and let's see how this

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.560 
the outer skirts and let's see how this
game<00:01:30.490> runs<00:01:30.910> with<00:01:31.330> a<00:01:31.360> dance<00:01:31.950> Wharf

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
game runs with a dance Wharf

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.030 
game runs with a dance Wharf
like<00:01:34.570> I've<00:01:34.690> said<00:01:34.869> in<00:01:35.020> the<00:01:35.170> past<00:01:35.200> the<00:01:35.740> grass

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
like I've said in the past the grass

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.109 
like I've said in the past the grass
area<00:01:36.520> is<00:01:36.850> not<00:01:37.570> the<00:01:37.810> reason<00:01:38.200> why<00:01:38.950> your<00:01:39.280> GPUs<00:01:39.910> are

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
area is not the reason why your GPUs are

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:41.280 
area is not the reason why your GPUs are
getting<00:01:40.420> eaten<00:01:40.660> up

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
getting eaten up

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.370 
getting eaten up
it's<00:01:42.220> just<00:01:42.400> unoptimized<00:01:43.020> that's<00:01:44.020> just<00:01:44.229> the

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
it's just unoptimized that's just the

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.920 
it's just unoptimized that's just the
best<00:01:44.530> way<00:01:44.710> to<00:01:44.740> say<00:01:45.070> it<00:01:45.390> here<00:01:46.390> we<00:01:46.509> are<00:01:46.540> we're<00:01:46.900> in

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
best way to say it here we are we're in

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.910 
best way to say it here we are we're in
kind<00:01:47.259> of<00:01:47.290> like<00:01:47.470> a<00:01:47.530> funky<00:01:48.040> area<00:01:49.410> getting<00:01:50.410> what

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
kind of like a funky area getting what

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.820 
kind of like a funky area getting what
87<00:01:51.610> frames<00:01:51.940> usage<00:01:52.450> is<00:01:52.630> in<00:01:52.780> bed<00:01:53.020> that's<00:01:53.470> a<00:01:53.650> cool

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
87 frames usage is in bed that's a cool

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.760 
87 frames usage is in bed that's a cool
thing<00:01:53.860> to<00:01:54.160> say<00:01:54.450> I'd<00:01:55.450> like<00:01:55.600> to<00:01:55.660> see<00:01:55.810> that<00:01:55.960> like<00:01:56.650> I
