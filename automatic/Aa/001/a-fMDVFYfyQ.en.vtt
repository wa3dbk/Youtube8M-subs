like<00:00:41.219> Martinez<00:00:42.149> but<00:00:42.390> I'm<00:00:42.450> not<00:00:42.629> too<00:00:42.750> sure<00:00:42.960> it

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
like Martinez but I'm not too sure it

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.380 
like Martinez but I'm not too sure it
was<00:00:43.260> doing<00:00:43.440> with<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.620> few<00:00:43.920> other<00:00:44.100> players<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:44.820> it

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
was doing with a few other players so it

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.600 
was doing with a few other players so it
didn't<00:00:45.840> take<00:00:46.050> me<00:00:46.200> long<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.410> be<00:00:46.829> able<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.129> take

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
didn't take me long to be able to take

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.340 
didn't take me long to be able to take
the<00:00:47.730> lead<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.059> ball<00:00:48.239> eventually<00:00:48.629> after<00:00:48.989> loads

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
the lead the ball eventually after loads

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.720 
the lead the ball eventually after loads
of<00:00:49.500> little<00:00:49.590> deflections<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.309> dropped<00:00:50.579> her<00:00:50.700> i

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
of little deflections it dropped her i

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.250 
of little deflections it dropped her i
believe<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.059> was<00:00:51.149> buettner<00:00:51.449> who<00:00:51.780> shot<00:00:52.110> on

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
believe that was buettner who shot on

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.959 
believe that was buettner who shot on
that<00:00:52.379> deflected<00:00:52.890> down<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.250> Erickson<00:00:53.670> who<00:00:53.789> got

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
that deflected down to Erickson who got

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.060 
that deflected down to Erickson who got
quite<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.270> lucky<00:00:54.690> header<00:00:54.870> go<00:00:55.440> into<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.920> back

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
quite a lucky header go into the back

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.380 
quite a lucky header go into the back
and<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.340> took<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.670> deflection<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.300> the

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
and that took a deflection and the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.150 
and that took a deflection and the
goalie<00:00:57.600> was<00:00:57.690> all<00:00:58.140> over<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.620> place<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.010> then

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
goalie was all over the place and then

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.069 
goalie was all over the place and then
surely<00:00:59.850> after<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.270> literally<00:01:00.690> as<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:00.960> can

as<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.280> can<00:01:29.610> see<00:01:29.820> I've<00:01:30.030> changed<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.540> slightly

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
as you can see I've changed it slightly

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.569 
as you can see I've changed it slightly
I<00:01:30.990> was<00:01:31.200> trying<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.590> adjust<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.070> team<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.400> to

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
I was trying to adjust the team that to

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.390 
I was trying to adjust the team that to
play<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.350> the<00:01:34.350> new<00:01:34.860> tournament<00:01:35.310> that's

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
play in the the new tournament that's

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.460 
play in the the new tournament that's
around<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.820> think<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.060> need<00:01:36.210> for<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:37.020> minimum

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
around I think you need for a minimum

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.679 
around I think you need for a minimum
for<00:01:37.770> nations<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.310> 11<00:01:38.700> different<00:01:38.970> teams<00:01:39.420> now

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.929 
for nations and 11 different teams now

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
on the left mid very very questionable

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.960 
on the left mid very very questionable

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
off I believe he then dropped Jordi Alba

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.690 
off I believe he then dropped Jordi Alba
back<00:02:29.500> into<00:02:29.860> that<00:02:29.980> position<00:02:30.220> I'm<00:02:30.550> not

back into that position I'm not

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.850 
back into that position I'm not
completely<00:02:30.940> sure<00:02:31.120> but<00:02:31.420> anyway<00:02:31.900> why<00:02:32.290> then<00:02:32.560> had

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
completely sure but anyway why then had

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.600 
completely sure but anyway why then had
the<00:02:33.160> man<00:02:34.120> advantage<00:02:34.330> but<00:02:34.930> however<00:02:35.709> I<00:02:36.130> was<00:02:36.370> very

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
the man advantage but however I was very

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.460 
the man advantage but however I was very
stupid<00:02:36.940> I<00:02:37.180> didn't<00:02:37.480> take<00:02:37.630> my<00:02:37.810> chances<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:38.380> then

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
stupid I didn't take my chances and then

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.750 
stupid I didn't take my chances and then
the<00:02:38.590> ball<00:02:38.740> dropped<00:02:39.070> to<00:02:39.190> him<00:02:39.370> on<00:02:39.490> the<00:02:39.580> edge<00:02:39.670> of

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
the ball dropped to him on the edge of

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.130 
the ball dropped to him on the edge of
the<00:02:39.850> box<00:02:40.060> he<00:02:40.240> did<00:02:40.390> a<00:02:40.420> nice<00:02:40.690> little<00:02:40.870> bit<00:02:41.050> of

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
the box he did a nice little bit of

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.410 
the box he did a nice little bit of
spinning<00:02:41.500> I<00:02:41.620> believe<00:02:41.980> it<00:02:42.310> went<00:02:42.580> to<00:02:42.730> Pogba<00:02:43.120> who

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
spinning I believe it went to Pogba who

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.330 
spinning I believe it went to Pogba who
then<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:44.200> mo<00:02:44.350> penalty<00:02:44.770> and<00:02:44.860> I<00:02:44.950> was<00:02:45.040> thinking

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
then the mo penalty and I was thinking

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.370 
then the mo penalty and I was thinking
oh<00:02:45.459> no<00:02:46.000> this<00:02:46.330> isn't<00:02:46.720> good<00:02:46.870> he's<00:02:47.050> already

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
oh no this isn't good he's already

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.530 
oh no this isn't good he's already
basically<00:02:47.739> back<00:02:48.130> into<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.459> game<00:02:48.610> and<00:02:49.090> I<00:02:49.209> think

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
basically back into the game and I think

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.540 
basically back into the game and I think
he<00:02:49.690> gave<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:50.470> penalty<00:02:50.800> to<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.130> upgraded

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
he gave the the penalty to the upgraded

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.780 
he gave the the penalty to the upgraded
Padre<00:02:51.910> yes<00:02:52.120> he<00:02:52.270> did<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:52.800> he<00:02:53.800> took<00:02:53.980> it<00:02:54.040> smashed

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
Padre yes he did and he took it smashed

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.060 
Padre yes he did and he took it smashed
in<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.000> top<00:02:55.209> right<00:02:55.420> corner<00:02:55.660> but<00:02:56.410> I<00:02:56.620> got<00:02:56.950> my

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
in the top right corner but I got my

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.590 
in the top right corner but I got my
fingertips<00:02:57.580> to<00:02:57.760> it<00:02:57.850> and<00:02:57.970> that<00:02:58.030> meant<00:02:58.360> it<00:02:58.480> was

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
fingertips to it and that meant it was
