believe there are a number of reasons

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.640 
believe there are a number of reasons
why<00:03:27.640> technology<00:03:28.510> should<00:03:28.780> never<00:03:29.200> replace

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
why technology should never replace

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.270 
why technology should never replace
