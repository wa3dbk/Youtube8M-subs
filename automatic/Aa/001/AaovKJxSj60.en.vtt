games up a notch if you want to start

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:57.940 
games up a notch if you want to start
increasing<00:01:56.149> your<00:01:56.450> progress<00:01:56.959> number<00:01:57.590> one<00:01:57.799> you

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
increasing your progress number one you

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.889 
increasing your progress number one you
need<00:01:58.099> to<00:01:58.159> be<00:01:58.369> consistent<00:01:58.849> you<00:01:59.599> need<00:01:59.810> to

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
need to be consistent you need to

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.319 
need to be consistent you need to
understand<00:02:00.469> as<00:02:00.709> well<00:02:00.739> that<00:02:01.009> the<00:02:01.909> routine

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
understand as well that the routine

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:05.499 
understand as well that the routine
you're<00:02:02.569> using<00:02:02.810> isn't<00:02:03.409> as<00:02:03.590> important<00:02:04.399> as<00:02:04.639> hard

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
you're using isn't as important as hard

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.260 
you're using isn't as important as hard
work<00:02:05.869> and<00:02:06.200> making<00:02:06.619> every<00:02:06.979> set<00:02:07.340> count<00:02:07.700> they're

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
work and making every set count they're

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.420 
work and making every set count they're
all<00:02:08.660> routines<00:02:09.170> are<00:02:09.380> basically<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:10.040> same

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
all routines are basically the same

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.700 
all routines are basically the same
thing<00:02:10.790> if<00:02:11.180> you're<00:02:11.630> intelligent<00:02:12.140> enough<00:02:12.650> to

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
thing if you're intelligent enough to

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:13.660 
thing if you're intelligent enough to
pick<00:02:13.010> a<00:02:13.040> routine

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
pick a routine

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.480 
pick a routine
that's<00:02:14.209> using<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.750> big-hitting<00:02:15.490> exercises

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
that's using the big-hitting exercises

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.670 
that's using the big-hitting exercises
so<00:02:17.030> if<00:02:17.150> you<00:02:17.300> have<00:02:17.510> that<00:02:17.780> in<00:02:17.930> place<00:02:17.959> most

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
so if you have that in place most

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.229 
so if you have that in place most
routines<00:02:19.099> are<00:02:19.310> basically<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:19.849> same<00:02:20.180> thing

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
routines are basically the same thing

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.300 
routines are basically the same thing
they're<00:02:20.959> just<00:02:21.170> different<00:02:21.349> ways<00:02:21.680> of<00:02:21.860> doing<00:02:22.190> the

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
they're just different ways of doing the

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.150 
they're just different ways of doing the
same<00:02:22.520> exercises<00:02:23.410> so<00:02:24.410> all<00:02:24.470> you<00:02:24.680> guys<00:02:24.860> out<00:02:25.099> there

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
same exercises so all you guys out there

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.550 
same exercises so all you guys out there
we're<00:02:25.910> obsessed<00:02:26.390> with<00:02:26.540> routine<00:02:27.050> set<00:02:27.380> that

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
we're obsessed with routine set that

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.130 
we're obsessed with routine set that
nonsense<00:02:28.069> aside<00:02:28.310> there<00:02:29.180> are<00:02:29.330> only<00:02:29.420> only<00:02:29.780> so

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
nonsense aside there are only only so

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.110 
nonsense aside there are only only so
many<00:02:30.260> exercises<00:02:30.709> you<00:02:31.130> can<00:02:31.160> do<00:02:31.430> in<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:31.640> gym<00:02:31.880> as

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
all that good stuff it doesn't really

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.800

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
to improve it's as simple as that you

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.710
