not<00:00:34.739> going<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.100> start<00:00:35.370> let's<00:00:36.329> take<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.600> look<00:00:36.870> at

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.319 
not going to start let's take a look at
those<00:00:37.140> three<00:00:37.380> issues<00:00:37.770> in<00:00:37.890> more<00:00:38.040> detail<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.730> list

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
those three issues in more detail I list

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.090 
those three issues in more detail I list
compression<00:00:39.960> as<00:00:40.110> number<00:00:40.440> one<00:00:40.649> because<00:00:40.920> I

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
compression as number one because I

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.740 
compression as number one because I
believe<00:00:41.700> it's<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.030> most<00:00:42.059> important<00:00:42.719> thing

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
believe it's the most important thing

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.260 
believe it's the most important thing
you<00:00:42.989> need<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.200> do<00:00:43.469> or<00:00:44.160> check<00:00:44.610> on<00:00:44.789> these<00:00:44.940> older

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
you need to do or check on these older

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.270 
you need to do or check on these older
diesel<00:00:45.600> engines<00:00:45.989> if<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.920> have<00:00:47.010> weak

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
diesel engines if you have weak

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.090 
diesel engines if you have weak
compression<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.750> may<00:00:49.020> never<00:00:49.379> be<00:00:49.620> able<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.890> fix

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
compression you may never be able to fix

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.650 
compression you may never be able to fix
that<00:00:50.280> problem<00:00:50.550> without<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.030> complete<00:00:51.360> overhaul

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
that problem without a complete overhaul

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.479 
that problem without a complete overhaul
so<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.170> don't<00:00:52.620> want<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.920> be<00:00:53.010> spending<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.370> lot

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
so you don't want to be spending a lot

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.430 
so you don't want to be spending a lot
of<00:00:53.520> money<00:00:53.760> or<00:00:53.910> throwing<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.300> lot<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.449> parts<00:00:54.870> at<00:00:55.079> a

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
of money or throwing a lot of parts at a

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.310 
of money or throwing a lot of parts at a
diesel<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.190> has<00:00:56.670> weak<00:00:56.910> compression<00:00:57.420> the
