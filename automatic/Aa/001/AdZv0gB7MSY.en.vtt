these now they didn't build the modem

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.000 
these now they didn't build the modem
into<00:03:36.419> it<00:03:36.540> because<00:03:36.900> well<00:03:37.349> I<00:03:37.650> don't<00:03:37.889> think

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
into it because well I don't think

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.170 
into it because well I don't think
people<00:03:38.069> are<00:03:38.250> using<00:03:38.459> modems<00:03:38.730> all<00:03:38.910> that<00:03:39.030> much

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
people are using modems all that much

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.180 
people are using modems all that much
anymore<00:03:39.419> but<00:03:39.810> it<00:03:40.410> does<00:03:40.590> come<00:03:40.799> with<00:03:40.829> a<00:03:40.950> USB

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
anymore but it does come with a USB

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.789 
anymore but it does come with a USB
modem<00:03:42.090> so<00:03:42.569> it's<00:03:42.750> there<00:03:42.959> in<00:03:43.169> case<00:03:43.230> you<00:03:43.530> need<00:03:43.680> it

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
modem so it's there in case you need it

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.530 
modem so it's there in case you need it
which<00:03:43.980> is<00:03:44.099> really<00:03:44.430> really<00:03:44.549> nice<00:03:44.819> so<00:03:45.000> we're

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
which is really really nice so we're

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.120 
which is really really nice so we're
going<00:03:45.660> to<00:03:45.720> show<00:03:45.900> you<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.139> inside<00:03:46.650> of<00:03:47.010> the

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
going to show you the inside of the

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.800 
going to show you the inside of the
computer<00:03:47.280> before<00:03:47.700> you<00:03:47.790> wrap<00:03:48.000> this<00:03:48.180> up<00:03:48.359> it's<00:03:48.720> a

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
computer before you wrap this up it's a

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.129 
computer before you wrap this up it's a
very<00:03:48.959> odd<00:03:49.139> case<00:03:49.709> it's<00:03:50.459> a<00:03:50.519> small<00:03:50.849> case<00:03:51.150> and<00:03:51.419> what

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
very odd case it's a small case and what

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.110 
very odd case it's a small case and what
makes<00:03:52.319> it<00:03:52.440> very<00:03:52.530> strange<00:03:52.950> is<00:03:53.190> the<00:03:53.310> way<00:03:53.489> this

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
makes it very strange is the way this

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.789 
makes it very strange is the way this
thing<00:03:54.389> comes<00:03:54.690> off<00:03:54.900> because<00:03:55.200> you'll<00:03:55.319> notice<00:03:55.709> at

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
thing comes off because you'll notice at

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.369 
thing comes off because you'll notice at
the<00:03:55.919> bottom<00:03:56.269> is<00:03:57.269> actually<00:03:57.629> part<00:03:57.930> of<00:03:57.989> the<00:03:58.109> cover

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
the bottom is actually part of the cover

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:00.379 
the bottom is actually part of the cover
that<00:03:58.590> comes<00:03:58.859> off<00:03:59.129> so<00:03:59.310> it's<00:03:59.430> very<00:03:59.609> strange

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
that comes off so it's very strange

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:03.080 
that comes off so it's very strange
say<00:04:00.959> the<00:04:01.109> truth<00:04:01.160> but<00:04:02.160> you<00:04:02.730> see<00:04:02.849> it's<00:04:02.940> very

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
say the truth but you see it's very

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.110 
say the truth but you see it's very
tight<00:04:03.359> in<00:04:03.569> here<00:04:03.870> take<00:04:04.049> a<00:04:04.079> look<00:04:04.319> very<00:04:05.120> very

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
blu-ray drive seems to take up

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.370 
blu-ray drive seems to take up
90%<00:04:28.650> of<00:04:28.800> the<00:04:29.190> interior<00:04:29.639> of<00:04:29.910> this<00:04:30.240> computer<00:04:30.900> so

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
90% of the interior of this computer so

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.469 
90% of the interior of this computer so
everything<00:04:32.340> else<00:04:32.490> very<00:04:32.880> very<00:04:33.060> small<00:04:33.419> very

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
everything else very very small very

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:36.260 
everything else very very small very
very<00:04:33.960> tightly<00:04:34.530> packed<00:04:34.760> so<00:04:35.760> it's<00:04:35.940> not<00:04:36.030> gonna<00:04:36.180> be

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
very tightly packed so it's not gonna be

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.850 
very tightly packed so it's not gonna be
a<00:04:36.389> machine<00:04:36.540> that<00:04:36.840> you<00:04:36.900> can<00:04:36.990> upgrade<00:04:37.199> easily

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
a machine that you can upgrade easily

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.159 
a machine that you can upgrade easily
because<00:04:38.460> both<00:04:38.970> of<00:04:39.120> the<00:04:39.180> expansion<00:04:39.690> slots<00:04:39.930> are

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
because both of the expansion slots are

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.129 
because both of the expansion slots are
already<00:04:40.620> being<00:04:40.830> used<00:04:41.220> and<00:04:41.610> they're<00:04:41.880> both

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
already being used and they're both

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.770 
already being used and they're both
low-profile<00:04:43.139> slots<00:04:43.680> so<00:04:44.430> you<00:04:45.150> want<00:04:45.330> to<00:04:45.389> be<00:04:45.510> sure

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
low-profile slots so you want to be sure

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.719 
low-profile slots so you want to be sure
if<00:04:46.199> you're<00:04:46.410> thinking<00:04:46.650> about<00:04:46.710> we<00:04:47.550> got

if you're thinking about we got

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.120 
if you're thinking about we got

upgrading and your mind and your eyes
and<00:04:50.669> your<00:04:50.790> heart<00:04:50.970> might<00:04:51.900> not<00:04:52.050> be<00:04:52.169> a<00:04:52.199> good

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
and your heart might not be a good

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.680 
and your heart might not be a good
machine<00:04:52.530> to<00:04:52.770> look<00:04:52.919> at<00:04:53.070> to<00:04:53.190> tell<00:04:53.310> you<00:04:53.340> the<00:04:53.430> truth

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
but it is a good machine if you just

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.770 
but it is a good machine if you just
