00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
have spun out on the exit there I just

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.810 
have spun out on the exit there I just
put<00:03:22.269> the<00:03:22.360> apex<00:03:22.660> a<00:03:22.750> bit<00:03:22.900> to<00:03:23.049> nastily<00:03:23.560> but<00:03:24.310> we'll

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
put the apex a bit to nastily but we'll

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.940 
put the apex a bit to nastily but we'll
see<00:03:25.030> that<00:03:25.180> we'll<00:03:25.360> see<00:03:25.570> that<00:03:25.600> the<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.620> timing

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
see that we'll see that the the timing

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.770 
see that we'll see that the the timing
difference<00:03:27.519> as<00:03:27.730> we<00:03:27.850> cross<00:03:28.120> through<00:03:28.390> into<00:03:28.660> the

cutting<00:03:39.730> out<00:03:39.849> otherwise<00:03:40.090> I<00:03:40.209> could<00:03:40.450> end<00:03:40.660> up

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
cutting out otherwise I could end up

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.650 
cutting out otherwise I could end up
ruing<00:03:41.590> that

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
ruing that

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.080

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
then we're almost all gone I went a bit

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.060 
then we're almost all gone I went a bit
wide<00:03:51.330> there<00:03:51.360> but<00:03:52.080> we're<00:03:52.260> when<00:03:52.590> we<00:03:52.710> get<00:03:52.860> to<00:03:52.980> the

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
wide there but we're when we get to the

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.830 
wide there but we're when we get to the
last<00:03:53.220> lap<00:03:53.430> I<00:03:53.580> will<00:03:53.730> look<00:03:53.910> to<00:03:54.120> over<00:03:54.390> taper<00:03:54.630> but

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
last lap I will look to over taper but

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.940 
last lap I will look to over taper but
the<00:03:54.900> moment<00:03:55.200> were<00:03:55.260> looking<00:03:55.530> to<00:03:55.620> get<00:03:55.800> them

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
the moment were looking to get them

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.080 
the moment were looking to get them
under<00:03:56.160> pressure<00:03:56.490> so<00:03:56.640> we<00:03:56.700> want<00:03:56.850> to<00:03:56.910> get<00:03:57.030> as

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
under pressure so we want to get as

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.450 
under pressure so we want to get as
close<00:03:57.270> as<00:03:57.420> possible<00:03:57.660> without<00:03:58.500> overtaking<00:03:59.280> so

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
close as possible without overtaking so

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.010 
close as possible without overtaking so
that<00:03:59.610> the<00:03:59.970> leader<00:04:00.180> of<00:04:00.270> the<00:04:00.360> race<00:04:00.480> is<00:04:00.690> like<00:04:00.840> oh
