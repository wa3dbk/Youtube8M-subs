couple<00:03:08.889> characters<00:03:09.310> it<00:03:09.519> is<00:03:09.549> amazingly<00:03:10.510> useful

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
couple characters it is amazingly useful

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.059 
couple characters it is amazingly useful
and<00:03:11.079> then<00:03:11.170> it<00:03:11.260> shuts<00:03:11.500> down<00:03:11.560> pretty<00:03:11.980> much

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
and then it shuts down pretty much

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.720 
and then it shuts down pretty much
inaudible
