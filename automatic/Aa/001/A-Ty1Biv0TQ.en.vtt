00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
his verse came down and the interesting

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.190 
his verse came down and the interesting
thing<00:02:39.040> is<00:02:39.400> what<00:02:39.610> does<00:02:39.760> Allah<00:02:40.000> say<00:02:40.180> don't<00:02:40.930> do<00:02:41.170> it

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
thing is what does Allah say don't do it

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.890 
thing is what does Allah say don't do it
because<00:02:42.090> they<00:02:43.090> could<00:02:43.269> turn<00:02:43.420> out<00:02:43.569> to<00:02:43.599> be<00:02:43.690> better

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
because they could turn out to be better

get out the measuring tape so they

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.690 
get out the measuring tape so they
started<00:03:20.230> measuring<00:03:20.440> arms<00:03:22.080> and<00:03:23.459> it<00:03:24.459> didn't

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
when they realized it was a metaphor

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.270

wives<00:03:39.400> of<00:03:39.580> the<00:03:39.640> prophets<00:03:40.000> a<00:03:40.090> lot<00:03:40.239> easier<00:03:40.680> so<00:03:41.680> he

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
wives of the prophets a lot easier so he

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.500 
wives of the prophets a lot easier so he
said<00:03:42.040> it<00:03:42.160> metaphorically<00:03:42.760> that<00:03:42.880> the<00:03:43.120> one<00:03:43.299> that

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
said it metaphorically that the one that

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:44.699 
said it metaphorically that the one that
will<00:03:43.630> have<00:03:43.690> the<00:03:43.840> longest<00:03:44.080> arms<00:03:44.290> mean<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.590> one

poor people will be the first one to
meet<00:03:48.790> me<00:03:48.940> in<00:03:48.970> the<00:03:49.120> life<00:03:49.269> of<00:03:49.390> the<00:03:49.510> year<00:03:49.630> after<00:03:49.980> so

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
model then they make fun of her for

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.259 
model then they make fun of her for
being<00:03:52.810> short<00:03:53.140> and<00:03:53.549> that<00:03:54.549> was<00:03:54.700> exactly<00:03:55.030> the

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
being short and that was exactly the

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:56.970 
being short and that was exactly the
point<00:03:55.510> that<00:03:55.780> the<00:03:55.959> Prophet<00:03:56.290> pointed<00:03:56.620> out<00:03:56.709> look

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980
