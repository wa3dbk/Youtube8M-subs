00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
I thought we'd give a first play at

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.510 
I thought we'd give a first play at
micro<00:00:32.050> machines<00:00:32.380> too<00:00:32.680> and<00:00:32.950> see<00:00:33.280> what<00:00:33.400> that's

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
micro machines too and see what that's

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.180 
micro machines too and see what that's
like<00:00:33.670> so<00:00:34.150> I'll<00:00:34.570> just<00:00:34.600> put<00:00:34.989> that<00:00:35.020> in<00:00:35.320> SAP<00:00:36.010> the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
like so I'll just put that in SAP the

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.150 
like so I'll just put that in SAP the
Cameron<00:00:36.640> over<00:00:36.850> quick<00:00:37.149> looks<00:00:37.390> really<00:00:38.160> alright

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160
