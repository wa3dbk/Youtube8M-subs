good stuff so another thing that I like

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.320 
good stuff so another thing that I like
about<00:01:24.869> this<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.979> label<00:01:26.939> does<00:01:27.150> not

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
about this is that the label does not

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.120 
about this is that the label does not
spoil<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:28.200> let's<00:01:28.350> say<00:01:28.470> you're<00:01:28.650> tipping<00:01:29.009> this

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
spoil so let's say you're tipping this

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.190 
spoil so let's say you're tipping this
over<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.880> little<00:01:30.119> bit<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.450> oil<00:01:30.659> gets<00:01:31.079> on

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
over and a little bit of the oil gets on

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.859 
over and a little bit of the oil gets on
the<00:01:31.320> label<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:32.430> doesn't<00:01:32.850> ruin<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.210> label<00:01:33.689> the

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
the label it doesn't ruin the label the

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.050 
the label it doesn't ruin the label the
label<00:01:34.049> stays<00:01:34.470> intact<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.280> as<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.579> see<00:01:35.790> it's<00:01:35.970> a

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
label stays intact and as you see it's a

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.050 
label stays intact and as you see it's a
shiny<00:01:36.439> label<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.680> isn't<00:01:38.340> affected<00:01:38.790> by<00:01:38.820> the

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
how I use this as a mouthwash and an air

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.800 
how I use this as a mouthwash and an air
freshener<00:02:26.550> is<00:02:26.850> basically<00:02:27.210> the<00:02:27.510> little

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
freshener is basically the little

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.930 
freshener is basically the little
containers<00:02:28.740> you're<00:02:28.860> going<00:02:29.130> to<00:02:29.310> put<00:02:29.520> them<00:02:29.610> in<00:02:29.760> I

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
containers you're going to put them in I

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.300 
containers you're going to put them in I
went<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.810> Walgreens<00:02:31.050> to<00:02:31.740> the<00:02:31.860> Travel<00:02:32.280> section

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
went to Walgreens to the Travel section

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.300 
went to Walgreens to the Travel section
and<00:02:32.910> I<00:02:33.000> picked<00:02:33.300> up<00:02:33.570> these<00:02:33.870> two<00:02:34.310> plastic

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
and I picked up these two plastic

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.580 
and I picked up these two plastic
containers<00:02:36.030> this<00:02:36.300> one<00:02:36.480> has<00:02:36.630> a<00:02:36.660> spritz<00:02:37.140> so<00:02:37.470> it's

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
containers this one has a spritz so it's

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.350 
containers this one has a spritz so it's
easier<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.100> spray<00:02:38.459> on<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.820> house

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
easier to spray on the house

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.400 
easier to spray on the house
and<00:02:39.709> this<00:02:40.709> one<00:02:40.920> is<00:02:41.160> like<00:02:41.490> a<00:02:41.520> little<00:02:41.850> cap<00:02:42.410> that

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
and this one is like a little cap that

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.550 
and this one is like a little cap that
would<00:02:43.800> be<00:02:44.100> easy<00:02:44.340> for<00:02:44.630> mouthwash<00:02:45.630> in<00:02:46.170> addition

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
would be easy for mouthwash in addition

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.199 
would be easy for mouthwash in addition
to<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:46.830> tea<00:02:46.980> tree<00:02:47.160> oil<00:02:47.430> you're<00:02:47.700> also<00:02:47.910> going<00:02:48.150> to

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
to the tea tree oil you're also going to

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.300 
to the tea tree oil you're also going to
need<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.810> main<00:02:49.140> solution<00:02:49.500> which<00:02:49.830> is<00:02:50.040> going<00:02:50.220> to

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
need the main solution which is going to

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.240 
need the main solution which is going to
be<00:02:50.459> water<00:02:50.730> now<00:02:51.540> you<00:02:51.600> could<00:02:52.020> use<00:02:52.050> tap<00:02:52.650> water<00:02:52.680> but

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
be water now you could use tap water but

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.400 
be water now you could use tap water but
tap<00:02:53.550> water<00:02:53.790> has<00:02:54.060> a<00:02:54.090> lot<00:02:54.330> of<00:02:54.480> chlorine<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:55.230> has

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
tap water has a lot of chlorine and has

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.500 
tap water has a lot of chlorine and has
other<00:02:55.650> chemicals<00:02:56.250> in<00:02:56.340> it<00:02:56.520> that<00:02:57.030> could<00:02:57.209> change

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
other chemicals in it that could change

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.960 
other chemicals in it that could change
the<00:02:57.870> chemical<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.709> chemistry<00:02:59.430> of<00:02:59.580> the

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
the chemical the chemistry of the

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.330 
the chemical the chemistry of the
solution<00:03:00.510> so<00:03:01.140> I<00:03:01.410> suggest<00:03:01.950> that<00:03:02.130> you<00:03:02.310> use

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
solution so I suggest that you use

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.210 
solution so I suggest that you use
purified<00:03:03.120> water<00:03:03.330> or<00:03:03.810> filtered<00:03:04.260> water<00:03:04.680> like<00:03:05.070> if

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
purified water or filtered water like if

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.130 
purified water or filtered water like if
you<00:03:05.340> had<00:03:05.550> water<00:03:05.910> it<00:03:06.120> you<00:03:06.300> put<00:03:06.480> into<00:03:06.630> a<00:03:06.750> bottle

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
you had water it you put into a bottle

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.260 
you had water it you put into a bottle
and<00:03:07.200> it<00:03:07.320> has<00:03:07.440> a<00:03:07.470> filter<00:03:07.980> that's<00:03:08.550> perfect<00:03:09.120> too

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
and it has a filter that's perfect too

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.140 
and it has a filter that's perfect too
and<00:03:09.980> if<00:03:10.980> you're<00:03:11.160> going<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.519> use<00:03:11.700> it<00:03:11.880> for<00:03:11.910> air

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
and if you're going to use it for air

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.140 
and if you're going to use it for air
freshener<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:12.780> you<00:03:13.709> want<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:14.040> add<00:03:14.220> another

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
freshener and you want to add another

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.110 
freshener and you want to add another
scent<00:03:15.660> let's<00:03:16.080> say<00:03:16.260> lavender<00:03:16.950> or<00:03:17.700> maybe<00:03:17.880> like<00:03:18.090> a

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
scent let's say lavender or maybe like a

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.180 
scent let's say lavender or maybe like a
rose<00:03:18.420> oil<00:03:18.840> or<00:03:19.110> something<00:03:19.320> like<00:03:19.530> that<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:20.040> make

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
rose oil or something like that to make

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.890 
rose oil or something like that to make
it<00:03:20.220> fresh<00:03:21.150> for<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.870> home<00:03:22.250> you<00:03:23.250> need<00:03:23.430> that<00:03:23.610> too

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
it fresh for the home you need that too

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.840 
it fresh for the home you need that too
so<00:03:24.900> now<00:03:25.230> I'm<00:03:25.440> going<00:03:25.709> to<00:03:25.830> show<00:03:26.100> you<00:03:26.160> a<00:03:26.400> close-up

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
so now I'm going to show you a close-up

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.080 
so now I'm going to show you a close-up
of<00:03:27.269> how<00:03:27.780> I<00:03:27.810> do<00:03:27.989> it<00:03:28.610> there's<00:03:29.610> not<00:03:29.760> a<00:03:29.820> lot<00:03:30.060> of

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
of how I do it there's not a lot of

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.530 
of how I do it there's not a lot of
measurements<00:03:30.750> I<00:03:30.810> kind<00:03:31.080> of<00:03:31.140> just<00:03:31.380> eyeball<00:03:31.920> it

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
measurements I kind of just eyeball it

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.900 
measurements I kind of just eyeball it
keep<00:03:33.540> in<00:03:33.690> mind<00:03:33.930> that<00:03:34.110> tea<00:03:34.380> tree<00:03:34.680> oil<00:03:34.830> is<00:03:35.190> very

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
keep in mind that tea tree oil is very

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.449
