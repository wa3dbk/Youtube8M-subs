00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.240
 recyclable with materials that you already 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.130

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.840

 a very cool idea present the 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.100
 people you like or even 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.680
 to give as decoration the 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.510
 your corner but demonstrate this step to 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.430
 I want to remind you, step. 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.590
 last year you already have some 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.020
 tips for Easter and has some other 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.449
 videos that you can adapt and use 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.550
 for that date then leave the links 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.440
 here does not like information 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.120
 the end of the video so I hope to the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.699
 end of the video I'll leave some tips 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.710
 are all very easy to make with 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.870
 cheap materials that frame 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.479
 I'm sure you'll like it. 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.880
 so that's it people write do this 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.659
 recycled easter egg just go on 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.659
 so in the video 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.100
 and for that step by step you are going 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.270
 balloon can be any 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.580
 size 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.960
 we will also need napkin 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:30.650
 toilet paper white glue brush one 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:33.440
 little water and paints glue pen 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.150
 relief paint relief to decorate 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.920
 so start to show only one 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.010
 a little water next to the white glue 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.560
 It's just a little more liquid there. 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.270
 reason the pieces of paper I prefer 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.120
 use the napkin because it is a bit 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.650
 thicker then makes it easier at the 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.320
 step by step you will have to do 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.860
 - layer like toilet paper is more 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.080
 thin 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.760
 You will have to make more layer that goes 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.190
 give more work 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.170
 then just go past glue on the balloon 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.050
 putting napkin over the top 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.330
 a school and making the layers 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.030
 I advise you to make a five 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.100
 layers of paper will then make the 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.959
 way you can control 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.820
 but that has the minimum name five 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.230
 layers of paper for after the balloon 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.690
 do not get wrinkled 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.180
 another tip you do not need to swamp 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.060
 the balloon and glued paper is the 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.190
 enough just to obey a balloon to 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.590
 paste the paper and leave the paper wet 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.760
 leave the paper moist but need not be 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.760
 nothing soggy 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.320
 there you can make small balloon balloon 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.600
 big can do in the middle of the balloon to 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.400
 to do as if it were a basket makes the 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.200
 way you think it's best 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.960
 I stayed for two days to have 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.180
 sure that the glue is very dry there is only 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.310
 wait for the balloon to take it from inside and 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.880
 hit the ball where it was open for 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.880
 stay very still 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.500
 and then it 's time to let go of creativity 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.140
 decorate the way you find it 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.930
 cool you can paint like i can be 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.910
 craft ink gouache ink 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.070
 any type of ink that adheres paper 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.230
 can decorate with embossed glue can 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.570
 decorating with a pen can pass glue 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:42.280
 put glitter on top then make the 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.280
 The way you think it's cool 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.640
 after the Easter egg is ready is 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.520
 just stuff it with treats or some 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.680
 something you want from the person and 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.720
 after filling the Easter egg is just 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.880
 close the way you find it easier 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.050
 can be a small piece of paper or even 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.050
 candy molds 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.560
 and a very cool idea for those who 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.530
 people made a style of a basket 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.389
 lining balloons is putting paper 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.760
 inside can be tissue paper paper 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:33.470
 chopped crepe stuff with the things that 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.620
 Do you want to then close with a plastic 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.620
 transparent 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:49.710
 and to finish and give a charm people of 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:52.169
 Easter I decided to put a plastic 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:55.020
 transparent decorated around 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:57.479
 I tied and made a tie then 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:00.349
 use creativity does the way you do 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:00.349
 find it cooler 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:59.300
 so this is very personal story that 

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:01.310
 You liked it, I liked it.
