take a divot afterwards so the key isn't
that<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.549> try<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.210> go<00:01:15.570> down<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.580> don't<00:01:17.580> ever<00:01:17.850> want

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
that I try to go down I don't ever want

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.710 
that I try to go down I don't ever want
to<00:01:18.299> try<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.630> hit<00:01:19.170> down<00:01:20.009> with<00:01:20.460> my<00:01:20.729> body<00:01:21.030> into<00:01:21.509> the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
to try to hit down with my body into the

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.440 
to try to hit down with my body into the
ground<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.259> want<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.100> keep<00:01:23.340> my<00:01:23.610> hands

ground I want to keep my hands

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.760 
ground I want to keep my hands
created<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.409> lag<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.610> club<00:01:26.939> strikes<00:01:27.770> down

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
created a lag so the club strikes down

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.149 
created a lag so the club strikes down
and<00:01:29.369> takes<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.119> divot<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:31.490> comes<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.930> steeper

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
and takes the divot it comes in steeper

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.950 
and takes the divot it comes in steeper
so<00:01:35.159> that's<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.610> key<00:01:35.850> let's<00:01:36.360> see<00:01:36.570> if<00:01:36.630> we<00:01:36.780> can

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
so that's the key let's see if we can

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:48.460 
so that's the key let's see if we can
make<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.320> work

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.690
