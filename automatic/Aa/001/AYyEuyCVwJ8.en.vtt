00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.320
 today we see how to change one's own 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.600
 entry with the program imovie the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.210
 Pretty old apple program 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.150
 the voices are so many I make you a 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.199
 example this one I can do it too 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:37.399
 that the ok guys how could you 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:40.800
 see work my voice has changed 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:46.249
 very easily today we will see how it is done 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.249
 the first thing we are going to open imovie 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:52.649
 when we open movie I recommend you 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.359
 close all open applications in 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.399
 In this case I make an exception with 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:59.539
 screenflow which is the application I am 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:07.650
 using right now because for 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:09.030
 register excuse me the moment we will go there 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.469
 we will find it here 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:16.369
 we will have to go on more here we will put the 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:16.369
 name of our project 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:23.789
 excuse me and we're going to open to press 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:28.950
 send hoc or create at this point let's go 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:31.259
 on archive it imports fair footage 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:39.600
 we import the movie we want to which 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:40.979
 with your voice we want to apologize for one 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.750
 time we imported ours 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.719
 movie here it is 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:50.130
 just click on it to enlarge it and 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:53.039
 bring it here automatically to imovie 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.670
 as you can see it will not show at the dock 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:59.640
 because our video will come 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.159
 enlarged if we want to solve this 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.829
 what should we go about this single 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:09.060
 type cutouts and rotation options 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:11.250
 allowed black end once we have 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.190
 having done this you will see a locri you see 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.160
 all 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.380
 we can move on to the tutorial we will have to 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.860
 right click on our clip and 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:25.840
 separate audio once we have done 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:30.320
 this thing we'll double click on 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:32.990
 this audio and we're going to decide the 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:50.000
 tone that we want to put as an example 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:51.800
 this or this in this case 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.250
 I would say that this is the most suitable 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:03:00.800
 then let's go on more fine excuse me 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:02.420
 here is our video once 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.880
 we did our video and it 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.460
 we want to export it is not enough to do 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.400
 other than sharing exports 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:14.000
 using quicktime player we will issue 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.740
 our name and let's go to save a 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.810
 this point will not be enough for us to wait 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:23.330
 that our video shows him on 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:25.580
 desktop and our video will be ready 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:31.190
 to be given a mandate by the 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:34.790
 our friends as we can see now 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:38.140
 my movie is on the desktop we can 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.140
 analyze it to come 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.840
 sorry if you do n't hear very well but 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.610
 if you get up too much afterwards, you no longer feel the 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.620
 my voice 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.920
