past<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.379> thought<00:00:55.559> was<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.860> didn't<00:00:56.160> even<00:00:56.219> have<00:00:56.370> a

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
past I thought was I didn't even have a

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.920 
past I thought was I didn't even have a
chance<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.789> make<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.030> back<00:00:57.329> not<00:00:57.660> even<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.899> little

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
chance to make it back not even a little

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.630 
chance to make it back not even a little
bit<00:00:58.140> his<00:00:58.440> recovery<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.010> one<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.399> his<00:00:59.489> weak

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
bit his recovery is one of his weak

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.130 
bit his recovery is one of his weak
points<00:00:59.940> and<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.059> think<00:01:00.270> gently<00:01:00.570> could<00:01:00.750> really

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
points and I think gently could really

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.740 
points and I think gently could really
abused<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.850> but<00:01:02.850> he<00:01:03.120> didn't<00:01:03.359> even<00:01:03.449> get<00:01:03.629> that

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.140 
probably yeah there we go all right full
minutes<00:02:21.250> like<00:02:22.250> yes<00:02:22.519> it<00:02:22.790> didn't<00:02:23.000> make<00:02:23.120> a

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
minutes like yes it didn't make a

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.550 
minutes like yes it didn't make a
difference<00:02:23.239> in<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:23.870> out<00:02:23.989> early<00:02:24.350> that

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
difference in and out early that

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.170 
difference in and out early that
definitely<00:02:25.070> was<00:02:25.250> a<00:02:25.280> less<00:02:25.549> than<00:02:25.730> two<00:02:25.820> min<00:02:25.970> ago

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
definitely was a less than two min ago

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
just not going to happen so let's see if

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.699 
just not going to happen so let's see if
simply<00:02:38.000> as<00:02:38.120> it<00:02:38.269> will<00:02:38.390> turn<00:02:38.540> it<00:02:38.690> around<00:02:38.750> he<00:02:39.530> does

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
simply as it will turn it around he does

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.199 
simply as it will turn it around he does
have<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:40.040> counter<00:02:40.340> pick<00:02:40.549> so<00:02:40.820> he<00:02:40.850> could<00:02:41.120> take

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
have the counter pick so he could take

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:42.880 
have the counter pick so he could take
it<00:02:41.269> to<00:02:41.420> a<00:02:41.510> stage<00:02:41.810> where<00:02:41.840> he<00:02:42.260> has<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.530> advantage

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
it to a stage where he has the advantage
