stuff<00:01:42.150> caught<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:43.250> that's<00:01:44.250> why<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.460> really<00:01:44.729> like

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
stuff caught so that's why I really like

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.249 
stuff caught so that's why I really like
it<00:01:45.439> and<00:01:47.090> usually<00:01:48.090> one<00:01:48.479> side<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.899> bruns<00:01:49.140> the

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
it and usually one side of the bruns the

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.910 
it and usually one side of the bruns the
other<00:01:49.439> side<00:01:49.649> is<00:01:49.770> still<00:01:50.009> open<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.970> burning<00:01:51.360> so

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
other side is still open to burning so

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.819 
other side is still open to burning so
it's<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.009> easiest<00:01:53.369> thing<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.759> found<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.270> use

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
it's the easiest thing I found to use

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:59.530 
it's the easiest thing I found to use
catch<00:01:55.829> it's<00:01:56.070> real<00:01:56.310> easy<00:01:56.340> for<00:01:56.790> spark
