00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
the HD PVR but it is not going to be the

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.970 
the HD PVR but it is not going to be the
best<00:02:23.910> quality<00:02:24.330> so<00:02:24.989> if<00:02:25.110> you<00:02:25.230> have<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.620> funds

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
but I guess you really just have to ask

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.550

yourself<00:02:29.910> what<00:02:30.569> is<00:02:30.599> the<00:02:30.900> direction<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.530> want
