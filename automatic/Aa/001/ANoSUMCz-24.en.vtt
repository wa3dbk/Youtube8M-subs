00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:06.400
 so her dear I was asked how that 

00:00:03.289 --> 00:00:08.629
 with the tailor of anna carina goes 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:13.700
 and I would just do that to you 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:20.570
 Show at the beak is like that 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:21.950
 a short guide to german and me 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:34.280
 Just show it to you now 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:38.810
 video here so a little screw the 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.070
 screwed monaco screwed best 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.890
 not so far that the screw is not 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.180
 falls out because otherwise quite a 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.260
 TÃ¼mmel is clean again 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:52.730
 to lift de fouss 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:58.719
 do not forget and then you get that 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:02.870
 So then you have to thread it out 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:07.190
 stress something happens that is here 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:10.659
 a small gift that must be up here in 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.659
 the screw in between rows 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.820
 so it's up here 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.820
 this little rod from the screw 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:35.390
 and here's another little smaller 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:45.950
 slot and the must with the screw 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:49.479
 Just like that, you just have to do the rows 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.479
 screw again tighten 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.660
 minster drop everything right now stream 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:16.350
 and then we have the point here too 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.350
 simple as that 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.670
 then I just have one here 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.350
 piece of fabric taken out of the cabinet 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.460
 no special fabric just looks over 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.460
 show you how it works 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:43.440
 a bit out and you have to go now 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:46.800
 where you want to sew later 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.190
 First, cut one to two 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.190
 centimeter 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:06.700
 So let's see if that's enough 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:13.270
 now guides the material here underneath 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:16.090
 and that has to be here now so here it is 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.770
 a small knife underneath if you 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.620
 look at the fast at home times 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.940
 this is the sharp edge and here 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.330
 the fabric has to line up 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:28.530
 he had to lie then he does 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.530
 the foot down 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:34.690
 we have to do it now 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:39.280
 I 've seen that in the clause 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:43.210
 looked at and that is somehow wrong 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.980
 So described a look anxious I 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.250
 Imagine that the fabric is here 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.810
 The picture is misguided 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.710
 so the knife can basically even here 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.930
 do not cut 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.540
 So the fabric must necessarily so 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:04:00.580
 be inserted 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:03.420
 that here the knife can cut after 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:07.020
 my machine at companies still the 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.020
 thread backwards 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:24.180
 and then we use a stitch of that 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.120
 no fall in the middle because i 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:32.130
 because the needle breaks in the best 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:36.480
 zigzag sting what probably go too 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:45.840
 I would already have to swing down 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:49.410
 could be the number 12 continue here 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:52.220
 not just middle class, too 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:56.190
 no case in the middle because 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:58.050
 I then wipe the needle I take 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:03.650
 now just the 5 the whole 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.650
 normal cross stitch tecdax 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.870
 So best if he is complete now 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:18.630
 start again the first time tried on 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:22.410
 First he turns the handwheel first 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:25.349
 to test the needle up 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:27.560
 no case here stands out in the 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:27.560
 center 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:42.060
 seen in this way stands over and over 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:54.700
 So now I can sew something and 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:56.920
 we'll see if it works like that 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.820
 See the fabric here is from the small one 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.770
 cut knife 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:05.370
 Search I have little closer 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:05.370
 get even better 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.160
 folding rear efficiency I want that 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.160
 high 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:35.759
 So let's see if it cuts well 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.759
 Has 

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:59.910
 So that's not the zigzag piece now 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:02.490
 that would be perfect , at least 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:04.230
 guess at my you can 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:07.560
 usually sew with cotton fabric 

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:10.250
 that's already in jersey so now 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:12.930
 Otherwise , I do not like that red fabric 

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:17.100
 So here you would have such a zigzag 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:18.990
 Sting the hem stumbled and here 

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:23.190
 that would be just our cut off 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:24.660
 piece of piece of fabric yes that was it 

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:26.670
 actually to never cut 

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:29.490
 I do not know any more now 

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:32.780
 should you see that's easy 

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.780
 I hope I could help you
