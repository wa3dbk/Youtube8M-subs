very<00:01:19.979> simple<00:01:20.369> in<00:01:20.430> its<00:01:20.580> design<00:01:20.670> but<00:01:21.210> it's<00:01:21.330> so

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
very simple in its design but it's so

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.120 
very simple in its design but it's so
well<00:01:21.780> made<00:01:21.810> it's<00:01:22.200> made<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.439> aluminium<00:01:22.530> and

me to do for just show you from this

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.920 
me to do for just show you from this
angle<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.650> can<00:01:38.549> actually<00:01:38.939> rotate<00:01:39.150> my

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
angle is I can actually rotate my

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.840 
angle is I can actually rotate my
Thunderbolt<00:01:40.500> Display<00:01:40.680> very<00:01:41.280> easily<00:01:41.520> now

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
Thunderbolt Display very easily now

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.609 
Thunderbolt Display very easily now
can't<00:01:42.150> move<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.450> too<00:01:42.659> much<00:01:42.899> because<00:01:43.229> I've<00:01:43.500> got

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
can't move it too much because I've got

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.789 
can't move it too much because I've got
my<00:01:43.740> speaker's<00:01:44.189> behind<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.820> but<00:01:45.420> basically<00:01:46.020> it

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
my speaker's behind it but basically it

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.510 
my speaker's behind it but basically it
allows<00:01:47.070> me<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.520> actually<00:01:48.180> rotate<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.490> into<00:01:50.490> a

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
allows me to actually rotate this into a

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.370 
allows me to actually rotate this into a
really<00:01:50.939> good<00:01:51.240> position<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.689> get<00:01:52.020> rid<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.200> any

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
really good position to get rid of any

example<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.450> very<00:01:57.899> very<00:01:58.140> good<00:01:58.290> product<00:01:58.530> let

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
example so a very very good product let

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.050 
example so a very very good product let
me<00:01:58.860> just<00:01:59.040> give<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.280> better<00:01:59.520> look<00:01:59.790> at<00:01:59.909> that

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
me just give you a better look at that

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.050 
me just give you a better look at that
so<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:01.170> can<00:02:01.439> actually<00:02:01.770> just<00:02:01.979> rotate<00:02:02.700> this<00:02:02.880> this

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
so I can actually just rotate this this

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.980 
so I can actually just rotate this this
way<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.689> it's<00:02:04.380> super<00:02:04.740> super<00:02:05.280> smooth<00:02:05.810> now<00:02:06.810> it

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
way and it's super super smooth now it

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.380 
way and it's super super smooth now it
got<00:02:07.200> me<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.560> thinking<00:02:08.069> as<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.429> how<00:02:08.879> else<00:02:09.179> I

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
got me to thinking as to how else I

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.510 
got me to thinking as to how else I
could<00:02:09.539> use<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.750> product<00:02:10.080> like<00:02:10.200> this<00:02:10.289> now<00:02:11.190> I

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
could use a product like this now I

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.949 
could use a product like this now I
don't<00:02:11.849> know<00:02:12.060> if<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.209> remember<00:02:12.420> but<00:02:12.569> I<00:02:12.690> used<00:02:12.870> to

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
don't know if you remember but I used to

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.610 
don't know if you remember but I used to
use<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.140> round

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
use a round

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.039 
use a round
revolving<00:02:14.099> table<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:15.090> do<00:02:15.209> product<00:02:15.569> shots<00:02:15.840> on

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
revolving table to do product shots on

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.720 
revolving table to do product shots on
and<00:02:16.530> I'm<00:02:16.650> thinking<00:02:16.680> of<00:02:17.040> buying<00:02:17.190> another<00:02:17.549> one

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
of these to actually use for some of my

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.380 
of these to actually use for some of my

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
product video so that I can have it on a

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.440 
product video so that I can have it on a
nice<00:02:21.690> clean-looking<00:02:22.200> aluminium<00:02:23.099> disc<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.819> I
