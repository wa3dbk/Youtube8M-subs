 parts to each part the song 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.300
 we incorporate a sequence and then 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.340
 when the same part of the repeats 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.940
 we perform the same song 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.080
 sequences that we did previously 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.110

 my recommendation for the public 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.920
 choose an activity that you like 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.190
 because what they like they are going to do 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.140
 with pleasure and with intensity and only if 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.020
 do an activity you continue with 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.540
 intensity is when you get cash all 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.280
 whatever it is to move or exercise 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.020
 welcome be it and if in addition to that it comes 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.230
 accompanied by music as if you will feel 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.239
 at a party what else can you ask for 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.200
 try it because you already know how important 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.200
 It is to know and neither
