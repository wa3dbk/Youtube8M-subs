important<00:00:23.460> because<00:00:23.550> she's<00:00:23.880> someone<00:00:24.210> that

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
important because she's someone that

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.660 
important because she's someone that
always<00:00:25.199> competes<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.189> plays<00:00:26.340> really<00:00:26.550> well

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
against top players especially she has

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.250 
against top players especially she has
that<00:00:29.460> extra<00:00:29.699> motivation<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.570> yeah<00:00:31.140> the

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
that extra motivation and yeah the

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.110 
that extra motivation and yeah the
return<00:00:31.560> was<00:00:31.800> very<00:00:32.279> important<00:00:32.730> because<00:00:32.820> she
