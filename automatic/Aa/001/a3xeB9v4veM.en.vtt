in kind of a you know bebop style so go
ahead<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.109> write<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.590> articulations<00:00:20.510> this

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
ahead and write the articulations this

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.890 
ahead and write the articulations this
is<00:00:21.660> just<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.930> little<00:00:22.140> chromatic<00:00:22.619> exercise<00:00:23.220> and

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
is just a little chromatic exercise and

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.240 
is just a little chromatic exercise and
but<00:00:24.900> we're<00:00:25.019> gonna<00:00:25.109> play<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.650> instead<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.130> just

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
but we're gonna play it instead of just

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.370 
but we're gonna play it instead of just
playing<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:29.359> we're<00:00:30.359> gonna<00:00:30.480> articulate<00:00:31.170> these

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
playing it we're gonna articulate these

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:54.310

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.399 

so<00:01:05.070> listen<00:01:05.370> to<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.550> one<00:01:05.760> more<00:01:05.940> time<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.540> just

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
so listen to that one more time and just

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.609 
so listen to that one more time and just
keep<00:01:07.590> in<00:01:07.800> mind<00:01:07.940> that<00:01:08.940> I<00:01:09.240> am<00:01:09.510> not<00:01:09.780> stopping<00:01:10.260> the

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
keep in mind that I am not stopping the

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.730 
keep in mind that I am not stopping the
air<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.130> air<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:12.360> flowing<00:01:13.229> through<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.530> whole

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
air the air is flowing through the whole

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.600 
air the air is flowing through the whole
thing<00:01:15.650> so

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.080 

so<00:01:40.930> I'm<00:01:41.230> basically<00:01:41.440> just<00:01:42.070> stopping<00:01:42.730> the<00:01:42.850> air

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
so I'm basically just stopping the air

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.450 
so I'm basically just stopping the air
with<00:01:43.720> my<00:01:43.930> tongue<00:01:44.230> well<00:01:44.950> I<00:01:44.980> think<00:01:45.130> I<00:01:45.310> was

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
with my tongue well I think I was

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.370 
with my tongue well I think I was
probably<00:01:45.760> way<00:01:46.060> outside<00:01:46.510> the<00:01:46.570> video<00:01:47.200> but

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
probably way outside the video but

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.100 
probably way outside the video but
hopefully<00:01:47.500> you<00:01:47.800> can<00:01:47.830> at<00:01:48.190> least<00:01:48.900> hear<00:01:49.900> how<00:01:50.050> that

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
hopefully you can at least hear how that

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.830 
hopefully you can at least hear how that
sounds<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:51.520> I<00:01:51.550> was<00:01:51.790> just<00:01:51.820> stopping<00:01:52.330> the<00:01:52.660> air

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
sounds so I was just stopping the air

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.430 
sounds so I was just stopping the air
with<00:01:53.290> my<00:01:53.530> tongue<00:01:53.830> you<00:01:54.220> know<00:01:54.370> as<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.930> air<00:01:56.110> is

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
with my tongue you know as the air is

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.950 
with my tongue you know as the air is
still<00:01:57.210> continuing<00:01:58.210> to<00:01:58.240> flow<00:01:58.630> through<00:01:58.870> the

still continuing to flow through the

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.150 
still continuing to flow through the
horn<00:01:59.400> so<00:02:00.570> let<00:02:01.570> me<00:02:01.690> just<00:02:02.290> say<00:02:02.440> one<00:02:02.710> last<00:02:02.740> thing

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160

about<00:02:03.550> it<00:02:03.790> if<00:02:04.750> you're<00:02:04.990> going<00:02:05.110> to<00:02:05.200> play<00:02:05.440> this<00:02:05.800> as

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
about it if you're going to play this as

about it if you're going to play this as
a<00:02:07.600> longer<00:02:08.140> line<00:02:13.740> something<00:02:14.740> like

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.700 

I'll<00:03:05.910> just<00:03:06.150> play<00:03:06.300> it<00:03:06.420> straight<00:03:06.720> with<00:03:06.960> no<00:03:07.020> with

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
I'll just play it straight with no with

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:13.510 
I'll just play it straight with no with
no<00:03:07.920> timing

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.710 

now<00:03:14.520> I'll<00:03:14.730> tongue<00:03:15.000> it<00:03:15.180> with<00:03:15.330> bebop

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
now I'll tongue it with bebop

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:25.280 
now I'll tongue it with bebop
articulation<00:03:23.330> so<00:03:24.330> the<00:03:24.660> only<00:03:24.810> difference

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
articulation so the only difference

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.820 
articulation so the only difference
between<00:03:25.820> this<00:03:26.820> and<00:03:27.180> this<00:03:27.600> that<00:03:28.380> I<00:03:28.470> want<00:03:28.680> to

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
between this and this that I want to

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:36.500 
between this and this that I want to
point<00:03:29.070> out<00:03:30.860> that's<00:03:31.860> not<00:03:32.010> too<00:03:32.340> sloppy<00:03:32.670> jeez<00:03:35.510> is

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
point out that's not too sloppy jeez is

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.920 
point out that's not too sloppy jeez is
that<00:03:37.250> when<00:03:38.250> playing<00:03:38.520> this<00:03:38.820> line<00:03:39.090> we're<00:03:39.810> going

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
that when playing this line we're going

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:53.480 
that when playing this line we're going
to<00:03:40.020> articulate<00:03:50.930> so<00:03:51.930> you<00:03:52.020> see<00:03:52.200> the<00:03:52.350> thing<00:03:52.590> just

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
to articulate so you see the thing just

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.170 
to articulate so you see the thing just
it<00:03:54.210> starts<00:03:54.660> with<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.500> two<00:03:55.940> articulated<00:03:56.940> notes
