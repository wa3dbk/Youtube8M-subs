00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
okay let's get started the first job I

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.290 
okay let's get started the first job I
ever<00:00:45.489> got<00:00:45.999> is<00:00:46.390> this<00:00:47.170> one<00:00:47.530> this<00:00:48.489> was<00:00:48.850> my<00:00:49.030> first

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
ever got is this one this was my first

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.509 
ever got is this one this was my first
chihuahuas<00:00:49.809> are<00:00:49.899> I<00:00:49.960> ever<00:00:50.170> got<00:00:50.469> and<00:00:50.980> I<00:00:51.159> think<00:00:51.429> I

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
chihuahuas are I ever got and I think I

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:52.919 
chihuahuas are I ever got and I think I
know<00:00:51.579> that<00:00:51.699> because<00:00:52.179> she<00:00:52.359> just<00:00:52.539> has<00:00:52.659> a<00:00:52.690> red

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:52.929 
know that because she just has a red

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:54.959 
know that because she just has a red
magnet<00:00:53.440> and<00:00:53.739> then<00:00:54.010> I<00:00:54.129> since<00:00:54.370> third<00:00:54.550> oldest

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:54.969 
magnet and then I since third oldest

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:57.450 
magnet and then I since third oldest
ones<00:00:55.179> so<00:00:55.960> it<00:00:56.379> just<00:00:56.559> kind<00:00:56.769> of<00:00:56.829> makes<00:00:57.039> sense<00:00:57.249> that

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
ones so it just kind of makes sense that

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.579 
ones so it just kind of makes sense that
she<00:00:57.579> was<00:00:58.120> my<00:00:58.269> first<00:00:58.510> one<00:00:58.659> her<00:00:59.019> name<00:00:59.260> is<00:00:59.350> Coco

00:00:59.579 --> 00:00:59.589 
she was my first one her name is Coco

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:02.520 
she was my first one her name is Coco
and<00:01:00.069> I<00:01:00.460> love<00:01:00.640> her<00:01:00.789> a<00:01:00.999> lot<00:01:01.030> and<00:01:01.659> she<00:01:02.230> came<00:01:02.379> in<00:01:02.499> a

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
and I love her a lot and she came in a

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.240 
and I love her a lot and she came in a
pack<00:01:03.089> with<00:01:04.089> a<00:01:04.120> bunny<00:01:04.570> and<00:01:05.050> a<00:01:05.260> squirrel<00:01:05.710> I<00:01:05.950> think

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
pack with a bunny and a squirrel I think

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.899 
pack with a bunny and a squirrel I think
it<00:01:06.880> was<00:01:07.000> like<00:01:07.090> an<00:01:07.240> out<00:01:07.450> outdoor<00:01:08.729> picnic<00:01:09.729> or

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
it was like an out outdoor picnic or

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.390 
it was like an out outdoor picnic or
something<00:01:10.210> like<00:01:10.300> that<00:01:10.360> so<00:01:11.230> yeah

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
something like that so yeah

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.740 
something like that so yeah
