hi everyone today's tutorial will be on

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.559 
hi everyone today's tutorial will be on
layering<00:00:03.360> kick<00:00:03.659> drums<00:00:03.899> in<00:00:04.200> reason<00:00:05.210> I'm<00:00:06.210> doing

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
layering kick drums in reason I'm doing

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.169 
layering kick drums in reason I'm doing
this<00:00:06.720> in<00:00:06.990> reason<00:00:07.319> 6<00:00:07.649> but<00:00:08.220> you<00:00:08.490> can<00:00:08.670> use<00:00:08.880> any<00:00:09.090> of

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
this in reason 6 but you can use any of

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.759 
this in reason 6 but you can use any of
the<00:00:09.269> other<00:00:09.389> versions<00:00:09.990> of<00:00:10.110> reason<00:00:10.410> to<00:00:10.500> do<00:00:10.620> this

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
the other versions of reason to do this

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.730 
the other versions of reason to do this
I<00:00:11.090> got<00:00:12.090> an<00:00:12.150> idea<00:00:12.450> for<00:00:12.630> this<00:00:12.690> video<00:00:13.019> from<00:00:13.349> an

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
I got an idea for this video from an

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.799 
I got an idea for this video from an
Ableton<00:00:14.040> tutorial<00:00:14.610> I<00:00:14.730> saw<00:00:15.059> which<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:15.599> on<00:00:15.719> the

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
Ableton tutorial I saw which is on the

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.930 
Ableton tutorial I saw which is on the
same<00:00:15.960> subject<00:00:16.260> so<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:17.190> thought<00:00:17.490> I'd<00:00:17.609> do<00:00:17.730> a

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
same subject so I thought I'd do a

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.150 
same subject so I thought I'd do a
version<00:00:18.180> for<00:00:19.109> all<00:00:19.170> those<00:00:19.380> reason<00:00:19.740> users<00:00:20.010> out

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
version for all those reason users out

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.450 
version for all those reason users out
there<00:00:20.600> so<00:00:21.600> basically<00:00:22.350> I've<00:00:22.769> made<00:00:23.130> a

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
there so basically I've made a

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.929 
there so basically I've made a
Combinator<00:00:24.240> patch<00:00:24.539> which<00:00:25.140> has<00:00:25.939> three

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
Combinator patch which has three

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.779 
Combinator patch which has three
different<00:00:26.970> samplers<00:00:27.750> in<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.250> each<00:00:29.250> hooked<00:00:29.609> up

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
different samplers in it each hooked up

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.930 
different samplers in it each hooked up
to<00:00:29.970> their<00:00:30.090> separate<00:00:30.570> eq's<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.940> compression

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
to their separate eq's and compression

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.700 
to their separate eq's and compression
maximizers<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:34.820> some<00:00:36.710> post-processing

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
maximizers and some post-processing

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.389 
maximizers and some post-processing
effects<00:00:38.579> as<00:00:38.879> well<00:00:39.500> so<00:00:40.500> I'll<00:00:40.739> start<00:00:40.980> off<00:00:41.160> by

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
effects as well so I'll start off by

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.090 
effects as well so I'll start off by
just<00:00:41.430> explain<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.480> little<00:00:42.510> bit<00:00:42.899> about<00:00:43.649> kick

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
just explain it a little bit about kick

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.150 
just explain it a little bit about kick
drums<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.670> how<00:00:44.789> they<00:00:44.969> can<00:00:45.090> be<00:00:45.210> made<00:00:45.390> up<00:00:46.160> kick

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
drums and how they can be made up kick

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.950 
drums and how they can be made up kick
drums<00:00:47.340> can<00:00:47.520> be<00:00:47.550> divided<00:00:47.910> into<00:00:48.360> three<00:00:48.660> main

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
drums can be divided into three main

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
drums can be divided into three main
parts<00:00:49.940> so<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.120> first<00:00:51.360> part<00:00:51.600> sub<00:00:52.530> which<00:00:52.770> is

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
parts so the first part sub which is

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.209 
parts so the first part sub which is
anything<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.610> lives<00:00:53.969> below<00:00:54.770> 100<00:00:55.770> Hertz<00:00:56.070> and

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
anything that lives below 100 Hertz and

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:03.290 
anything that lives below 100 Hertz and
the<00:00:56.340> frequency<00:00:56.699> spectrum<00:00:56.820> so<00:00:57.360> just<00:00:57.600> play<00:01:02.300> and

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
the frequency spectrum so just play and

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.950 
the frequency spectrum so just play and
then<00:01:03.960> we've<00:01:04.320> also<00:01:04.439> got<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:05.519> punch<00:01:05.820> which<00:01:06.720> is

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
then we've also got the punch which is

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.910 
then we've also got the punch which is
between<00:01:07.320> 100<00:01:08.250> Hertz<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.210> thousand<00:01:09.920> Hertz

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
between 100 Hertz and a thousand Hertz

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.429 
between 100 Hertz and a thousand Hertz
which<00:01:11.460> sounds<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:12.000> bit<00:01:12.119> like<00:01:12.360> this<00:01:15.439> finally

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
which sounds a bit like this finally

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.620 
which sounds a bit like this finally
living<00:01:16.799> above<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.400> thousand<00:01:17.759> Hertz<00:01:18.119> generally

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
living above a thousand Hertz generally

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.780 
living above a thousand Hertz generally
is<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.140> cleanest<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.950> clicky<00:01:20.220> part<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.670> the

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
is the cleanest the clicky part of the

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.359 
is the cleanest the clicky part of the
initial<00:01:21.060> attack<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.600> kick<00:01:21.810> drums<00:01:24.680> and<00:01:25.680> if<00:01:26.220> you

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
initial attack of kick drums and if you

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.249 
initial attack of kick drums and if you
pills<00:01:26.640> individual<00:01:27.390> elements<00:01:27.750> together<00:01:27.900> and

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
pills individual elements together and

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.600 
pills individual elements together and
this<00:01:31.259> big<00:01:31.740> sounding<00:01:32.159> kick<00:01:32.280> drum<00:01:33.500> so<00:01:34.610> firstly

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
this big sounding kick drum so firstly

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.310 
this big sounding kick drum so firstly
what<00:01:35.790> I'll<00:01:35.939> do<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.240> I'll<00:01:36.360> just<00:01:36.390> talk<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.140> for

what I'll do is I'll just talk you for
you've<00:01:37.530> got<00:01:38.450> I've<00:01:39.450> got<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.750> line<00:01:40.020> mixer<00:01:40.320> here

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
you've got I've got a line mixer here

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.690 
you've got I've got a line mixer here
free<00:01:42.000> channels<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.750> first<00:01:43.020> channel<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.770> for

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
free channels the first channel is for

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.630 
free channels the first channel is for
the<00:01:45.030> sub<00:01:45.360> part<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.200> kick<00:01:46.380> drum<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:47.520> it's

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
the sub part of the kick drum so it's

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.149 
the sub part of the kick drum so it's
just<00:01:47.729> an<00:01:47.880> nn-19<00:01:48.659> Digital<00:01:49.350> sampler<00:01:49.560> I've<00:01:49.890> used

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
just an nn-19 Digital sampler I've used

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:57.969 
just an nn-19 Digital sampler I've used
with<00:01:52.939> this<00:01:53.939> kick<00:01:54.270> drums<00:01:54.540> from<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.619> sample<00:01:56.219> pack

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
with this kick drums from a sample pack

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.209 
with this kick drums from a sample pack
there<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.130> go<00:01:59.340> waa<00:02:00.170> singing<00:02:01.170> drums<00:02:01.500> sample

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
there you go waa singing drums sample

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.420 
there you go waa singing drums sample
pack<00:02:02.399> finger<00:02:02.759> from<00:02:02.939> loop<00:02:03.119> masters<00:02:03.829> and<00:02:04.829> so

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
pack finger from loop masters and so

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.320 
pack finger from loop masters and so
it's<00:02:05.579> just<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:06.229> drum<00:02:07.229> kicked<00:02:07.799> on<00:02:07.920> from<00:02:08.099> there

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
it's just a drum kicked on from there

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.610 
it's just a drum kicked on from there
what<00:02:09.330> I've<00:02:09.420> done<00:02:09.599> is<00:02:09.840> I've<00:02:10.020> filtered<00:02:10.649> out<00:02:11.009> the

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
what I've done is I've filtered out the

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.170 
what I've done is I've filtered out the
it's<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:13.709> little<00:02:13.920> pass<00:02:14.040> filter<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:14.640> I<00:02:14.879> filled

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
it's a little pass filter so I filled

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.420 
it's a little pass filter so I filled
out<00:02:15.390> all<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.569> high<00:02:15.749> frequencies<00:02:16.319> I've<00:02:17.159> also

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
out all the high frequencies I've also

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.699 
out all the high frequencies I've also
used<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.969> amp<00:02:18.269> envelope<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:19.019> shape<00:02:19.290> this<00:02:19.469> kick

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
used the amp envelope to shape this kick

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.050 
used the amp envelope to shape this kick
drum<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.659> get<00:02:21.659> the<00:02:21.780> tail<00:02:21.989> how<00:02:22.290> I<00:02:22.319> want<00:02:22.590> it

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
drum to get the tail how I want it

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.569 
drum to get the tail how I want it
I've<00:02:24.060> also<00:02:24.239> used<00:02:24.359> an<00:02:24.599> e<00:02:24.749> key<00:02:24.989> EQ<00:02:25.920> sorry<00:02:26.159> just<00:02:26.430> to

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:26.579 
I've also used an e key EQ sorry just to

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.160 
I've also used an e key EQ sorry just to
get<00:02:26.760> rid<00:02:26.969> of<00:02:26.999> all<00:02:27.329> those<00:02:27.450> high<00:02:27.659> frequencies<00:02:28.139> I

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
get rid of all those high frequencies I

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.699 
from vengeance
I<00:02:39.959> think<00:02:40.799> avenge<00:02:41.159> in<00:02:41.310> sample<00:02:41.700> pack<00:02:42.560> again<00:02:43.560> I've

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
I think avenge in sample pack again I've

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.440 
I think avenge in sample pack again I've
used<00:02:43.739> a<00:02:44.069> little<00:02:44.280> pass<00:02:44.459> for<00:02:44.700> just<00:02:45.000> a<00:02:45.090> rule<00:02:45.269> off

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
used a little pass for just a rule off

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.890 
used a little pass for just a rule off
someone<00:02:45.750> was<00:02:45.870> high<00:02:46.079> and<00:02:46.939> I've<00:02:47.939> used<00:02:48.329> one

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
someone was high and I've used one

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.479 
someone was high and I've used one
please<00:02:52.099> okay<00:02:53.099> that's<00:02:53.310> not<00:02:53.519> used<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:56.280> eke

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
please okay that's not used to to eke

please okay that's not used to to eke
use<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:56.969> get<00:02:57.060> rid<00:02:57.239> of<00:02:57.269> the<00:02:57.480> low<00:02:57.629> and<00:02:59.419> yep<00:03:00.739> along

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
use to get rid of the low and yep along

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.379 
use to get rid of the low and yep along
with<00:03:01.889> that<00:03:02.040> filter<00:03:02.400> there<00:03:02.579> to<00:03:03.060> get<00:03:03.180> really

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389 
with that filter there to get really

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:03.740 
with that filter there to get really
high

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
high

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.140 
high
I've<00:03:04.560> also<00:03:04.739> put<00:03:05.069> on<00:03:05.250> a<00:03:05.280> compressor<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:06.090> a

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
I've also put on a compressor and a

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.509 
I've also put on a compressor and a
Maximizer<00:03:06.659> some<00:03:07.169> of<00:03:07.230> these<00:03:07.319> samples<00:03:07.590> they

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
Maximizer some of these samples they

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.899 
Maximizer some of these samples they
didn't<00:03:08.819> need<00:03:08.879> lift<00:03:09.120> it<00:03:09.239> up<00:03:09.359> a<00:03:09.480> bit<00:03:09.650> them<00:03:10.760> to<00:03:11.760> get

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
didn't need lift it up a bit them to get

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.119 
didn't need lift it up a bit them to get
that<00:03:12.060> pumped<00:03:12.299> in<00:03:12.389> this<00:03:12.510> fruit<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:13.129> then

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
that pumped in this fruit and then

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:19.039 
that pumped in this fruit and then
finally<00:03:14.669> we<00:03:15.180> have<00:03:15.590> the<00:03:16.669> another<00:03:17.669> nn-19<00:03:18.449> for

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
finally we have the another nn-19 for

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.949 
finally we have the another nn-19 for
the<00:03:19.229> clicky<00:03:19.439> part<00:03:19.769> of<00:03:19.919> the<00:03:20.009> kick<00:03:20.159> drum<00:03:20.959> so

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
the clicky part of the kick drum so

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.390 
the clicky part of the kick drum so
there's<00:03:22.229> a<00:03:22.319> notch<00:03:22.500> filter<00:03:22.769> gum<00:03:23.069> for<00:03:23.250> there

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
there's a notch filter gum for there

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.039 
there's a notch filter gum for there
again<00:03:23.790> of<00:03:23.970> shape<00:03:24.359> that<00:03:24.599> using<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:24.930> amp

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
again of shape that using the amp

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:30.110 
again of shape that using the amp
envelope<00:03:25.229> and<00:03:26.870> I've<00:03:27.870> used<00:03:28.290> an<00:03:29.009> EQ<00:03:29.579> basically

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
envelope and I've used an EQ basically

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.729 
envelope and I've used an EQ basically
as<00:03:30.180> a<00:03:30.239> high-pass<00:03:30.599> filter<00:03:31.019> to<00:03:31.139> get<00:03:31.259> rid<00:03:31.439> of<00:03:31.470> all

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
as a high-pass filter to get rid of all

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.569 
as a high-pass filter to get rid of all
those<00:03:31.919> low<00:03:32.430> end<00:03:32.669> frequencies<00:03:34.250> also<00:03:35.250> I've<00:03:35.370> used

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
those low end frequencies also I've used

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.520 
those low end frequencies also I've used
the<00:03:35.669> Maximizer<00:03:36.180> just<00:03:36.540> to<00:03:36.750> bring<00:03:36.989> the<00:03:37.139> level<00:03:37.470> up

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
the Maximizer just to bring the level up

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:45.249 
the Maximizer just to bring the level up
a<00:03:37.650> bit<00:03:37.829> and<00:03:38.370> then<00:03:39.109> finally<00:03:40.109> I've<00:03:40.790> used<00:03:41.790> an<00:03:42.889> EQ

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:45.259 
a bit and then finally I've used an EQ

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:48.559 
a bit and then finally I've used an EQ
to<00:03:46.259> eke<00:03:46.439> use<00:03:46.769> a<00:03:47.099> compressor<00:03:47.879> and<00:03:47.970> a<00:03:48.030> Maximizer

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
to eke use a compressor and a Maximizer

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.719 
to eke use a compressor and a Maximizer
to<00:03:48.870> shape<00:03:49.139> the<00:03:49.409> whole<00:03:49.560> sound<00:03:49.919> of<00:03:50.069> all<00:03:50.280> three

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:50.729 
to shape the whole sound of all three

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:53.869 
to shape the whole sound of all three
individual<00:03:51.239> elements<00:03:51.659> together<00:03:52.579> which<00:03:53.579> makes

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
individual elements together which makes

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:57.199 
individual elements together which makes
it<00:03:54.030> sound<00:03:54.150> really<00:03:54.449> nice<00:03:54.599> and<00:03:54.840> punchy<00:03:55.229> and<00:03:56.209> so

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
it sound really nice and punchy and so

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.050 
it sound really nice and punchy and so
what<00:03:57.629> I've<00:03:57.780> done<00:03:57.930> here<00:03:58.109> is<00:03:58.530> I've<00:03:58.680> linked<00:03:59.060> link

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
what I've done here is I've linked link

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.050 
what I've done here is I've linked link
certain<00:04:00.419> parameters<00:04:01.069> to<00:04:02.069> the<00:04:02.579> Combinator

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
certain parameters to the Combinator

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.860 
certain parameters to the Combinator
controls<00:04:04.069> so<00:04:05.069> the<00:04:05.189> first<00:04:05.509> control<00:04:06.509> you<00:04:06.659> have

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
controls so the first control you have

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.499 
controls so the first control you have
is<00:04:07.199> the<00:04:07.799> low<00:04:07.979> mid<00:04:08.219> crossover<00:04:08.819> so<00:04:08.969> how<00:04:09.120> much<00:04:09.329> the

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:09.509 
is the low mid crossover so how much the

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:12.319 
is the low mid crossover so how much the
mid<00:04:09.799> the<00:04:10.799> how<00:04:11.459> much<00:04:11.609> of<00:04:11.729> the<00:04:11.789> punch<00:04:12.000> you<00:04:12.239> again

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
mid the how much of the punch you again

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:13.789 
mid the how much of the punch you again
free<00:04:12.750> and<00:04:12.870> how<00:04:12.930> much<00:04:13.079> does<00:04:13.199> the<00:04:13.319> sub<00:04:13.530> you<00:04:13.560> game

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
free and how much does the sub you game

00:04:13.799 --> 00:05:22.550 
free and how much does the sub you game
through<00:04:14.099> so<00:04:14.699> just<00:04:14.879> play<00:04:15.030> that

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.679 

the<00:05:23.560> final<00:05:23.860> control<00:05:24.069> we<00:05:24.250> have<00:05:24.659> which<00:05:25.659> is

00:05:25.679 --> 00:05:25.689 
the final control we have which is

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:28.230 
the final control we have which is
basically<00:05:26.259> just<00:05:26.550> the<00:05:27.550> length<00:05:27.759> of<00:05:27.939> the<00:05:28.029> tail

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
basically just the length of the tail

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:35.860 
basically just the length of the tail
and<00:05:32.219> as<00:05:33.219> you<00:05:33.400> can<00:05:33.520> hear

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:44.530 

nobody<00:05:36.680> gets<00:05:36.980> tired<00:05:42.910> that's<00:05:43.910> basically<00:05:44.360> it

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
the punchin click and it's quite

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:19.240 
the punchin click and it's quite
important<00:06:18.380> to<00:06:18.410> fill<00:06:18.590> the<00:06:18.620> boat<00:06:18.860> with<00:06:19.040> the

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250 
important to fill the boat with the

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.420 
important to fill the boat with the
envelope<00:06:19.760> of<00:06:20.000> each<00:06:20.389> of<00:06:20.870> the<00:06:21.110> samples<00:06:21.590> to<00:06:22.250> get

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
envelope of each of the samples to get

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:29.370 
envelope of each of the samples to get
right<00:06:22.760> and<00:06:22.970> get<00:06:23.180> it<00:06:23.300> so<00:06:23.590> nice<00:06:26.740> yeah<00:06:27.800> also
