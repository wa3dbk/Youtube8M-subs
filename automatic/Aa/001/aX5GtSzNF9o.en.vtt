00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.190 
right here and then I glued them
together<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:19.430> then<00:02:19.939> this<00:02:20.150> popsicle<00:02:20.660> stick<00:02:21.050> I

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200

glued<00:02:21.470> it<00:02:21.620> at<00:02:21.800> an<00:02:21.950> angle<00:02:22.160> so<00:02:22.580> it<00:02:22.730> stand<00:02:23.060> up<00:02:23.270> like

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
glued it at an angle so it stand up like

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.170 
glued it at an angle so it stand up like
this<00:02:23.720> and<00:02:24.200> then<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.310> core<00:02:25.489> part<00:02:25.700> right<00:02:25.790> here

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
this and then the core part right here

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.390 
this and then the core part right here
is<00:02:26.239> just<00:02:26.599> to<00:02:26.780> cover<00:02:27.079> up<00:02:27.409> all<00:02:27.739> the<00:02:27.769> goo<00:02:28.069> that<00:02:28.099> was

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
is just to cover up all the goo that was

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.589 
is just to cover up all the goo that was
right<00:02:28.579> there<00:02:28.730> to<00:02:28.909> make<00:02:29.030> it<00:02:29.180> look<00:02:29.299> a<00:02:29.329> whole<00:02:29.569> lot

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
that also at an angle so you can put a

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.939 
that also at an angle so you can put a
picture<00:02:34.489> on<00:02:34.670> it
