00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.770 

before<00:00:44.570> we<00:00:44.870> put<00:00:45.050> this<00:00:45.170> crap<00:00:45.410> paper<00:00:45.770> down

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
before we put this crap paper down

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.630 
before we put this crap paper down
there's<00:00:47.780> some<00:00:48.110> baseboard<00:00:48.590> there<00:00:48.830> and<00:00:49.070> because

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
there's some baseboard there and because

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.210 
there's some baseboard there and because
we're<00:00:49.820> going<00:00:49.910> to<00:00:49.970> float<00:00:50.270> out<00:00:50.420> the<00:00:50.690> wall<00:00:51.560> we're

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
we're going to float out the wall we're

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.620 
we're going to float out the wall we're
going<00:00:52.340> to<00:00:52.400> end<00:00:52.520> up<00:00:52.610> putting<00:00:52.850> new<00:00:53.090> baseboard

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:53.630 
going to end up putting new baseboard

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.590 
going to end up putting new baseboard
down<00:00:53.870> so<00:00:54.520> I'm<00:00:55.520> going<00:00:55.700> to<00:00:55.760> take<00:00:55.910> this<00:00:56.060> baseboard

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
down so I'm going to take this baseboard

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.940 
down so I'm going to take this baseboard
out<00:00:56.840> right<00:00:57.620> now<00:00:58.090> before<00:00:59.090> I<00:00:59.450> install<00:01:00.110> the<00:01:00.590> craft

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:00.950 
out right now before I install the craft

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.469 
out right now before I install the craft
paper<00:01:02.020> that<00:01:03.020> way<00:01:03.230> I<00:01:03.260> can<00:01:03.710> put<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:05.089> masking

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
paper that way I can put the masking

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:06.730 
paper that way I can put the masking
tape<00:01:05.509> all<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:05.930> way<00:01:05.990> up<00:01:06.140> against<00:01:06.499> the<00:01:06.590> wall

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
tape all the way up against the wall

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.700 
tape all the way up against the wall
because<00:01:06.920> once<00:01:07.460> I<00:01:07.640> get<00:01:08.270> ready<00:01:08.450> to<00:01:08.539> put<00:01:08.630> that<00:01:08.749> to

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
because once I get ready to put that to

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.620 
because once I get ready to put that to
pull<00:01:09.890> that<00:01:10.009> base<00:01:10.219> out<00:01:10.460> later<00:01:10.789> then<00:01:11.479> there's

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
pull that base out later then there's

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:12.730 
pull that base out later then there's
going<00:01:11.749> to<00:01:11.810> be<00:01:11.869> a<00:01:11.929> void<00:01:12.170> there<00:01:12.439> and<00:01:12.560> then<00:01:12.649> I'll

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
going to be a void there and then I'll

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.099 
going to be a void there and then I'll
have<00:01:12.920> to<00:01:13.070> tape<00:01:13.670> down<00:01:13.969> some<00:01:14.479> masking<00:01:14.840> tape<00:01:14.869> at

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:15.109 
have to tape down some masking tape at

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:17.109 
have to tape down some masking tape at
that<00:01:15.259> point<00:01:15.560> once<00:01:16.159> the<00:01:16.310> masking<00:01:16.729> tape<00:01:16.759> and<00:01:17.060> the

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
that point once the masking tape and the

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.599 
that point once the masking tape and the
craft<00:01:17.359> paper<00:01:17.600> gets<00:01:18.319> dust<00:01:18.619> on<00:01:18.859> it<00:01:19.039> it's<00:01:19.249> hard<00:01:19.490> to

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:19.609 
craft paper gets dust on it it's hard to

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:23.620 
craft paper gets dust on it it's hard to
put<00:01:19.960> new<00:01:20.960> masking<00:01:21.799> tape<00:01:22.009> on<00:01:22.249> there<00:01:22.579> so<00:01:22.880> the

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
put new masking tape on there so the

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.050 
put new masking tape on there so the
sake<00:01:23.960> of<00:01:24.229> convenience<00:01:25.009> I'm<00:01:25.640> going<00:01:25.819> to<00:01:25.880> take

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
sake of convenience I'm going to take

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.149 
sake of convenience I'm going to take
that<00:01:26.240> out<00:01:26.420> now<00:01:26.450> I<00:01:26.990> just<00:01:27.649> want<00:01:27.829> to<00:01:27.950> show<00:01:28.100> you

this<00:01:28.429> it's<00:01:28.670> been<00:01:28.850> this<00:01:29.240> baseboards<00:01:29.929> been

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
this it's been this baseboards been

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:32.440 
this it's been this baseboards been
painted<00:01:30.560> it's<00:01:30.679> been<00:01:30.829> talked<00:01:31.130> at<00:01:31.369> the<00:01:31.399> top<00:01:31.520> so

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
painted it's been talked at the top so

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.809

before I take it out I'm going to go

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:36.010 
before I take it out I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:34.909> and<00:01:35.090> score<00:01:35.359> it<00:01:35.450> with<00:01:35.569> a<00:01:35.600> sheetrock

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
ahead and score it with a sheetrock

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.840 
ahead and score it with a sheetrock
knife<00:01:36.049> because<00:01:36.530> of<00:01:36.679> the<00:01:36.979> new<00:01:37.130> baseboard<00:01:37.670> is

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
knife because of the new baseboard is

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.620 
knife because of the new baseboard is
going<00:01:38.810> to<00:01:38.869> be<00:01:39.020> higher<00:01:39.229> than<00:01:39.439> that<00:01:39.499> anyways<00:01:40.009> so

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
going to be higher than that anyways so

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.480 
going to be higher than that anyways so
if<00:01:41.630> you<00:01:42.139> ever<00:01:42.259> run<00:01:42.350> across<00:01:42.619> this<00:01:43.069> one<00:01:43.310> of<00:01:43.399> your

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
going to come out of it

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.170 
going to come out of it
just<00:04:20.370> going<00:04:20.520> to<00:04:20.580> use<00:04:20.670> a<00:04:20.700> pair<00:04:21.030> of<00:04:21.560> about

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.180 
just going to use a pair of about
electrical<00:04:24.180> cutters<00:04:24.510> you<00:04:24.810> can<00:04:25.530> either<00:04:25.710> cut<00:04:26.040> it

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
electrical cutters you can either cut it

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.910 
electrical cutters you can either cut it
or<00:04:26.400> you<00:04:26.550> can<00:04:26.730> grab<00:04:26.940> on<00:04:27.150> to<00:04:27.390> it<00:04:27.420> just<00:04:27.710> work<00:04:28.710> it

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
or you can grab on to it just work it

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.730 
or you can grab on to it just work it
pull<00:04:29.160> it<00:04:29.280> pull<00:04:29.580> it<00:04:30.000> pull<00:04:30.330> it<00:04:30.510> this<00:04:31.350> comes<00:04:31.620> right
