00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.219
 There are different ways of preparing the 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.139
 shrimp cocktail but I'm going to 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.000
 show what they can find and 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.060
 Enjoy on Colombian beaches 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.150
 let's start with a pound of shrimp 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.250
 cool I prefer it so they can 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.200
 use it also that the shrimp that already 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.510
 it's frozen but I think the 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.920
 flavor is never the same too we are going to 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:37.260
 have garlic water sauce spicy sauce 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:41.120
 tomato mayonnaise red onion lemon and what 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.120
 we are going to accompany with soda crackers 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.250
 we already have the boiling water with a 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.500
 little bit of salt and we are going to place 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.660
 boil the shrimp will pass 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.610
 only a few minutes and just that 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.500
 these change color to pink 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.800
 it means that they are already 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:03.550
 these shrimp served exactly 5 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.470
 minutes and here I'm going to strain it 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.870
 Rosaditos come well I'll put them in 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.630
 the fridge because the shrimp like you 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.910
 you know the cocktail is eaten cold then 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.910
 we're going to put in the fridge then 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:19.020
 we're going to peel it so we can continue 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.020
 making our cocktail 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.310
 these shrimp were in the fridge 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:29.360
 enough time to cool off and 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.470
 Be cool, I'm cutting them 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.049
 because I'm working with some 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.909
 pretty big shrimp 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.700
 the size 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.920
 will depend on the recipient and the 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.980
 utensils that you are going to use 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.170
 at the time of enjoying them 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.140
 they can do them also as I said 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:53.700
 initially with frozen shrimp or 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.800
 suddenly with some that already sell fresh 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.300
 but if we are going to use them raw as 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.730
 I started the recipe 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.120
 remember that besides peeling them too 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:07.240
 they must remove a bold vein that passes 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.660
 over here on the top surface of the 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.660
 shrimp 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:17.750
 we're going to start putting together the cocktail 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:21.140
 then we put the shrimp 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.310
 we will also place the water in 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.580
 Garlic 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:30.860
 to dip it in this garlic water 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:33.150
 the red onion wins me I cried 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.210
 chopping this red onion because I wanted 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:41.360
 that it was well chopped 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:44.270
 you must place tomato sauce to taste 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.010
 and a little mayonnaise also the 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.769
 taste 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.690
 do not forget to put a few drops 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:55.380
 of hot sauce 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.420
 and the screen in a lemon 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.410
 I 'm not going to squeeze the full lemon 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.410
 only a few drops 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:08.480
 they mix it and enjoy it 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.000
 good shrimp and all meals 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.459
 of sea are attributed several 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.740
 properties and this is why I'm going to 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.990
 make another for my husband 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.830
 let's repeat what we did 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.830
 initially 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.880
 we place the shrimp 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.770
 the garlic water that we are going to place 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.830
 because as its name indicates in itself is 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:34.890
 regular water crushes a few 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.530
 years and then they leave it there with a 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:41.610
 tiny bit of salt that garlic water I 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:44.660
 I did yesterday and it's good enough 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:49.450
 to make the cocktails today 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.450
 we already have the onion the tomato sauce 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.770
 some mayonnaise too 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.680
 and the lemon juice 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:08.310
 also do not forget a few drops of sauce 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.310
 spicy to your liking 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.800
 and we are going to mix it 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.879
 and this was what we did first 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.530
 and the shrimp cocktail well at least 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:26.260
 on the beaches they always enjoy it with 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:30.480
 cookies at the end truth and now the 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.480
 most important part let's try it 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:37.349
 good 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:40.789
 close your eyes and imagine that you are 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:40.789
 on a beach it looked great 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.870
 they enjoyed the cocktail as much as I did 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.120
 of shrimp or they like sea food 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.780
 I have another video with the recipe from 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.780
 fish ceviche
