00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.089
 I continue to delete everything here after 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.890
 especially my last video which 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.039
 laid out went such a small hype 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.800
 like like go there like it do it 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.539
 I had such thoughts and ideas for 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.390
 score your comments 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.910

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.059

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.950
 I want to show you what the phone is on 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.980

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:42.510
 did it fly or not 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.700
 phone and the day many very much asked here in 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.129
 this is the ending but not really me 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.910
 really and if you go stand the door and there is not 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:54.180
 there will be grids and I have complicated my task and 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:58.320
 went when will be the lattices and 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:02.969
 now see what i do i will jump 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.320
 from here when there were bars 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.960
 it was impossible to get out of there 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.170
 first I was asked to go here 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.280
 and open this door but as you see here 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.229
 the card is actually needed and here by the shield 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.210
 or know if this card exists 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.650
 in fact but so usually not 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.670
 pass the 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.240
