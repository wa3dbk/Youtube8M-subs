chocolate milkshake recipe and on the
herships<00:03:30.150> website<00:03:30.600> so<00:03:30.959> I'm<00:03:31.140> using<00:03:31.410> Hershey's

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
herships website so I'm using Hershey's

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.960 
herships website so I'm using Hershey's
cocoa<00:03:32.610> powders<00:03:33.830> you<00:03:34.830> use<00:03:35.069> two<00:03:35.310> tablespoons

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
cocoa powders you use two tablespoons

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.240 
cocoa powders you use two tablespoons
this<00:03:36.890> and<00:03:37.890> then<00:03:38.880> you<00:03:39.000> also<00:03:39.239> add<00:03:39.720> a<00:03:40.440> tablespoon

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
this and then you also add a tablespoon

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.910 
this and then you also add a tablespoon
of<00:03:41.280> regular<00:03:41.760> white<00:03:42.570> sugar<00:03:42.600> I<00:03:43.049> think<00:03:43.079> to<00:03:43.440> offset

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
of regular white sugar I think to offset

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:57.800 
of regular white sugar I think to offset
the<00:03:44.220> fact<00:03:44.250> that<00:03:44.549> this<00:03:44.760> is<00:03:45.030> unsweetened<00:03:45.570> cocoa

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.800 

okay<00:03:59.580> so<00:04:00.580> now<00:04:00.760> that<00:04:00.790> we've<00:04:01.060> got<00:04:01.209> everything<00:04:01.480> in

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
okay so now that we've got everything in

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.360 
okay so now that we've got everything in
here<00:04:02.110> I<00:04:02.140> thought<00:04:02.470> it<00:04:02.530> would<00:04:02.800> be<00:04:02.920> a<00:04:02.950> good<00:04:03.130> demo

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
here I thought it would be a good demo

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.400 
here I thought it would be a good demo
for<00:04:03.610> you<00:04:03.670> guys<00:04:03.849> if<00:04:04.030> I<00:04:04.209> did<00:04:04.720> the<00:04:04.810> smoothie<00:04:05.230> mode

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
for you guys if I did the smoothie mode

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.740 
for you guys if I did the smoothie mode
on<00:04:05.650> this<00:04:06.300> and<00:04:07.300> go<00:04:07.450> ahead<00:04:07.630> and<00:04:07.780> turn<00:04:07.930> it<00:04:08.080> on<00:04:08.400> and

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
on this and go ahead and turn it on and

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.120 
on this and go ahead and turn it on and
then<00:04:10.750> see<00:04:11.140> there's<00:04:11.319> a<00:04:11.410> smoothie<00:04:11.769> program

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
then see there's a smoothie program

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:45.190 
then see there's a smoothie program
about<00:04:12.340> in<00:04:12.489> there<00:04:12.640> so<00:04:12.790> let's<00:04:12.849> go

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.410 

so<00:04:46.200> you<00:04:46.260> can<00:04:46.470> see<00:04:46.650> the<00:04:47.010> sort<00:04:47.340> of<00:04:47.430> alternating

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
so you can see the sort of alternating

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.030 
so you can see the sort of alternating
pattern<00:04:48.900> of<00:04:49.050> it<00:04:49.140> starts<00:04:49.440> and<00:04:49.620> stops<00:04:49.800> and

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
pattern of it starts and stops and

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.940 
pattern of it starts and stops and
starts<00:04:50.190> and<00:04:50.340> stops<00:04:50.640> and<00:04:51.630> since<00:04:52.200> I<00:04:52.350> have<00:04:52.590> some

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
starts and stops and since I have some

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.500 
starts and stops and since I have some
dry<00:04:53.370> ingredients<00:04:53.490> in<00:04:54.000> here<00:04:54.150> I'm<00:04:54.210> going<00:04:54.330> to<00:04:54.390> go

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
dry ingredients in here I'm going to go

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:55.730 
dry ingredients in here I'm going to go
ahead<00:04:54.690> and<00:04:54.810> run<00:04:54.900> it<00:04:54.990> through<00:04:55.020> a<00:04:55.200> few<00:04:55.440> the<00:04:55.560> other

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
ahead and run it through a few the other

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.950 
ahead and run it through a few the other
ones<00:04:55.980> as<00:04:56.220> well<00:04:56.400> so<00:04:56.670> they<00:04:56.820> can<00:04:56.850> demonstrate<00:04:57.570> it

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
ones as well so they can demonstrate it

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.600 
ones as well so they can demonstrate it
before<00:04:58.170> you<00:04:58.230> and<00:04:58.380> also<00:04:58.590> get<00:04:58.710> those<00:04:58.890> mixed<00:04:59.250> in<00:04:59.400> I

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
before you and also get those mixed in I

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.010 
before you and also get those mixed in I
probably<00:04:59.880> should<00:05:00.150> have<00:05:00.240> put<00:05:00.390> the<00:05:00.480> dry<00:05:00.690> stuff

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
probably should have put the dry stuff

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:26.680 
probably should have put the dry stuff
in<00:05:01.200> first<00:05:01.470> but

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.090
