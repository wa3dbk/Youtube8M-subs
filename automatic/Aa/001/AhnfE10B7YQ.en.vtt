00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
future this is the start we look at me

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.249

to<00:02:06.700> look<00:02:06.820> at<00:02:07.000> this<00:02:07.119> innovation<00:02:07.600> and<00:02:07.990> always

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
to look at this innovation and always

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.650 
to look at this innovation and always
improving<00:02:08.619> performance<00:02:09.119> it's<00:02:10.119> an<00:02:10.360> it's<00:02:10.570> a

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
improving performance it's an it's a

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.979 
improving performance it's an it's a
never<00:02:10.840> ending<00:02:10.929> goal<00:02:11.530> I<00:02:12.000> think<00:02:13.000> it<00:02:13.150> elevates

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
never ending goal I think it elevates

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.320 
never ending goal I think it elevates
them<00:02:14.230> as<00:02:14.440> a<00:02:14.470> brand<00:02:14.830> it<00:02:15.130> drives<00:02:15.700> value<00:02:16.150> for

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
them as a brand it drives value for

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.070 
them as a brand it drives value for

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.400 
consistency sending a singular message

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
extremely proud of this this kind of

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.870 
extremely proud of this this kind of
moment<00:02:32.440> when<00:02:32.769> you<00:02:32.860> see<00:02:33.040> it<00:02:33.160> actually<00:02:33.340> put<00:02:33.760> on

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
moment when you see it actually put on

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.870 
moment when you see it actually put on
body<00:02:34.120> and<00:02:34.390> put<00:02:34.570> into<00:02:34.720> life<00:02:34.959> I<00:02:35.230> think<00:02:35.880> probably

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
body and put into life I think probably

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.550 
body and put into life I think probably
the<00:02:37.090> best<00:02:37.330> moment<00:02:37.420> would<00:02:37.810> be<00:02:38.290> when<00:02:38.470> the

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
the best moment would be when the

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.440 
the best moment would be when the
athletes<00:02:38.920> themselves<00:02:39.220> put<00:02:39.790> it<00:02:39.880> on<00:02:40.030> and<00:02:40.239> see

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
athletes themselves put it on and see

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.210 
athletes themselves put it on and see
their<00:02:40.630> reactions<00:02:41.140> and<00:02:41.290> actually<00:02:41.980> probably

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
their reactions and actually probably

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.740 
their reactions and actually probably
even<00:02:42.400> better<00:02:42.700> is<00:02:42.850> when<00:02:43.030> they<00:02:43.180> take<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.540> field

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
even better is when they take the field

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.110 
even better is when they take the field
and<00:02:44.080> get<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.620> first<00:02:44.860> victory<00:02:45.250> epidode<00:02:45.730> those

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
and get the first victory epidode those

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.150 
and get the first victory epidode those
are<00:02:46.299> those<00:02:46.480> moments<00:02:46.720> that<00:02:47.019> basically<00:02:47.799> give<00:02:48.040> us

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
are those moments that basically give us

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.009 
are those moments that basically give us
chills<00:02:48.489> and<00:02:48.760> that's<00:02:48.940> what<00:02:49.120> makes<00:02:49.299> makes<00:02:49.870> our

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
chills and that's what makes makes our

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.100 
chills and that's what makes makes our
