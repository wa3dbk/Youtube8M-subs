00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
iron horns that i got from mining if you

iron horns that i got from mining if you
guys<00:00:34.380> did<00:00:34.710> not<00:00:34.739> know<00:00:35.190> this<00:00:35.760> method<00:00:36.149> right<00:00:36.300> here

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
guys did not know this method right here

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.540 
guys did not know this method right here
is<00:00:36.660> very<00:00:37.020> good<00:00:37.320> for<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.559> low-level<00:00:37.829> smithing<00:00:38.399> if

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
is very good for a low-level smithing if

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.520 
is very good for a low-level smithing if
you<00:00:38.670> are<00:00:38.730> trying<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.059> get<00:00:39.180> 44<00:00:39.930> gold<00:00:40.110> ores<00:00:40.320> or

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
you are trying to get 44 gold ores or

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.130 
you are trying to get 44 gold ores or
something<00:00:40.770> like<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:40.890> I'm<00:00:41.670> 111<00:00:42.660> experience

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
something like that I'm 111 experience

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.240 
something like that I'm 111 experience
when<00:00:43.260> you're<00:00:43.379> making<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.680> right<00:00:43.860> thing<00:00:44.129> I

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
when you're making the right thing I

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.639 
when you're making the right thing I
believe<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.149> 111<00:00:45.660> or<00:00:46.020> it's<00:00:46.140> like<00:00:46.230> 100<00:00:46.559> if

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
believe it is 111 or it's like 100 if

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.369 
believe it is 111 or it's like 100 if
you<00:00:46.739> don't<00:00:46.920> make<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.160> right<00:00:47.190> thing<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:48.379> yeah

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
you don't make the right thing and yeah

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.470 
you don't make the right thing and yeah
mining<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:49.950> iron<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.460> only<00:00:50.610> gives<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.940> 35

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
mining and iron it only gives you 35

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.930 
mining and iron it only gives you 35
mining<00:00:52.050> experience<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.739> ideally<00:00:53.489> if<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.760> want

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
mining experience so ideally if you want

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.420 
mining experience so ideally if you want
to<00:00:54.030> get<00:00:54.120> like<00:00:54.270> 85<00:00:54.750> mining<00:00:55.320> which<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.219> don't

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
to get like 85 mining which is I don't

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.950 
to get like 85 mining which is I don't
know<00:00:56.520> how<00:00:56.670> much<00:00:56.820> experience<00:00:56.940> at<00:00:57.480> leas<00:00:57.750> but<00:00:57.870> if

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
know how much experience at leas but if

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.930 
know how much experience at leas but if
you<00:00:58.050> get<00:00:58.170> 3.5<00:00:58.739> no<00:00:58.980> mining<00:00:59.190> expense<00:00:59.579> from<00:00:59.670> iron

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
you get 3.5 no mining expense from iron

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.000 
you get 3.5 no mining expense from iron
ore<00:01:00.149> which<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.930> buttload<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.410> experience

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
ore which is a buttload of experience

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.070 
ore which is a buttload of experience
you<00:01:02.190> can<00:01:02.550> actually<00:01:02.699> get<00:01:02.940> 11<00:01:03.390> million<00:01:03.600> spinning

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
you can actually get 11 million spinning

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.660 
you can actually get 11 million spinning
Sprint's<00:01:04.350> with<00:01:04.530> those<00:01:04.739> iron<00:01:05.040> ores<00:01:05.309> if<00:01:05.519> you

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
Sprint's with those iron ores if you

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.149 
Sprint's with those iron ores if you
bank<00:01:06.000> them<00:01:06.210> all<00:01:06.360> that's<00:01:06.840> just<00:01:07.159> completely

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
bank them all that's just completely

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.710 
bank them all that's just completely
farfetch<00:01:08.729> I'm<00:01:08.939> when<00:01:09.090> anyone's<00:01:09.360> match<00:01:09.540> you

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
ever do that but on the ratio for

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.130 
ever do that but on the ratio for
submitting<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.180> mining<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.630> really<00:01:12.930> good<00:01:13.049> at

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
submitting and mining is really good at

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.980 
submitting and mining is really good at
arts<00:01:13.380> workshop<00:01:14.090> so<00:01:15.090> yeah<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.570> very<00:01:15.780> good<00:01:15.900> for

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
arts workshop so yeah and very good for

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.149 
arts workshop so yeah and very good for
the<00:01:16.110> low<00:01:16.200> levels<00:01:16.500> because<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:16.890> think<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.100> only

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
the low levels because I think it only

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.730 
the low levels because I think it only
requires<00:01:17.490> like<00:01:17.880> 20<00:01:18.780> smithing<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.320> given<00:01:19.710> that

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
requires like 20 smithing and given that

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.380 
requires like 20 smithing and given that
not<00:01:20.220> too<00:01:20.340> sure<00:01:20.520> just<00:01:20.759> do<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.939> knight's<00:01:21.119> sword

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
not too sure just do the knight's sword

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.630 
not too sure just do the knight's sword
which<00:01:22.290> gives<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.740> 29<00:01:23.159> smithing<00:01:23.520> right

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
which gives you the 29 smithing right

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.130 
which gives you the 29 smithing right
away<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.030> then<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.210> can<00:01:24.360> do<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.570> method<00:01:24.990> I

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
away and then you can do this method I

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.530 
away and then you can do this method I
believe<00:01:25.740> right<00:01:25.770> away<00:01:26.159> until<00:01:26.400> whatever<00:01:27.240> level

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
believe right away until whatever level

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.140 
believe right away until whatever level
you<00:01:27.689> want<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.930> stop<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.259> out<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.380> guess<00:01:28.850> but<00:01:29.850> yes

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
you want to stop it out I guess but yes

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.969 
you want to stop it out I guess but yes
I<00:01:30.299> went<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.630> tiny<00:01:30.990> bit<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.259> mining<00:01:31.560> i<00:01:31.650> had<00:01:31.799> i

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
pretty cool to look at I guess one

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.330 
guys know where increased I believer
their<00:05:07.300> updated<00:05:07.660> and<00:05:08.560> I<00:05:08.650> believe<00:05:08.920> one<00:05:09.130> of<00:05:09.160> them

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
their updated and I believe one of them

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.490 
their updated and I believe one of them
is<00:05:09.460> aberrant<00:05:09.910> spectres<00:05:10.060> so<00:05:10.750> if<00:05:11.080> I<00:05:11.230> get<00:05:11.380> that

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
is aberrant spectres so if I get that

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.230 
is aberrant spectres so if I get that
Slayer<00:05:11.740> task<00:05:12.040> or<00:05:12.280> if<00:05:12.400> I<00:05:12.490> want<00:05:12.520> to<00:05:12.730> go<00:05:12.820> camp<00:05:13.060> them

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
Slayer task or if I want to go camp them

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.640 
Slayer task or if I want to go camp them
I<00:05:13.300> guess<00:05:13.420> I<00:05:13.540> go<00:05:13.690> check<00:05:14.080> them<00:05:14.200> out<00:05:14.320> for<00:05:14.500> a<00:05:14.530> little

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
I guess I go check them out for a little

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.190 
I guess I go check them out for a little
bit<00:05:14.770> that'd<00:05:15.670> be<00:05:15.700> a<00:05:15.820> decent<00:05:16.030> task<00:05:16.630> to<00:05:16.870> actually

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200 
bit that'd be a decent task to actually

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.990 
bit that'd be a decent task to actually
do<00:05:17.380> maybe<00:05:17.770> even<00:05:17.920> off<00:05:18.070> task<00:05:18.400> for<00:05:18.610> a<00:05:18.670> little<00:05:18.820> bit

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
do maybe even off task for a little bit

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.230 
do maybe even off task for a little bit
I<00:05:19.210> don't<00:05:19.570> think<00:05:19.750> it's<00:05:19.870> the<00:05:20.050> great<00:05:21.240> experience

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240
