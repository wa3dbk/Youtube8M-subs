belly<00:00:41.430> comes<00:00:42.030> down<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.480> few<00:00:42.540> other<00:00:42.930> factors

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
belly comes down to a few other factors

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.950 
belly comes down to a few other factors
firstly<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.309> serving<00:00:44.670> size<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:45.059> beer<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.510> 12<00:00:45.840> to

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
firstly the serving size a beer is 12 to

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.830 
firstly the serving size a beer is 12 to
16<00:00:46.379> ounces<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.829> glass<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.489> wine<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:48.000> 5<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.539> 6

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
16 ounces a glass of wine is 5 to 6

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.770 
16 ounces a glass of wine is 5 to 6
ounces<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:50.039> shot<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.399> only<00:00:50.579> 1<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.120> 2<00:00:51.329> ounces

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
ounces and a shot is only 1 to 2 ounces

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.990 
ounces and a shot is only 1 to 2 ounces
so<00:00:52.379> beer<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.860> often<00:00:53.219> consumed<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:53.760> higher

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
so beer is often consumed in higher

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.850 
so beer is often consumed in higher
quantities<00:00:54.329> than<00:00:54.809> other<00:00:55.050> types<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.530> alcohol

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
quantities than other types of alcohol

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.860 
quantities than other types of alcohol
and<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.370> you're<00:00:56.670> consuming<00:00:57.090> more<00:00:57.360> calories

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
and so you're consuming more calories

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.900 
and so you're consuming more calories
there<00:00:58.469> are<00:00:58.559> also<00:00:58.710> lifestyle<00:00:59.340> factors<00:00:59.730> at<00:00:59.879> play

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
there are also lifestyle factors at play

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.779 
there are also lifestyle factors at play
like<00:01:00.539> poor<00:01:00.870> diet<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.710> often<00:01:01.980> see<00:01:02.129> beer<00:01:02.370> served

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
like poor diet you often see beer served

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.969 
like poor diet you often see beer served
alongside<00:01:03.149> foods<00:01:03.629> like<00:01:03.899> sausages<00:01:04.650> a

hamburgers and pizza a very poor diet

with<00:01:08.400> or<00:01:08.670> without<00:01:08.909> beer<00:01:09.659> can<00:01:10.080> alone<00:01:10.530> cause<00:01:11.070> the

with or without beer can alone cause the
pot<00:01:11.610> belly<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.119> you're<00:01:12.420> even<00:01:12.750> more<00:01:13.020> prone<00:01:13.350> if

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
pot belly and you're even more prone if

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.219 
pot belly and you're even more prone if
you're<00:01:13.770> over<00:01:14.010> 35<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.790> or<00:01:15.240> if<00:01:15.689> you're<00:01:15.930> male

after<00:01:16.920> 35<00:01:17.520> years<00:01:17.549> metabolism<00:01:18.479> slows<00:01:19.070> down<00:01:20.070> you

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
after 35 years metabolism slows down you

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.580 
after 35 years metabolism slows down you
can't<00:01:20.880> eat<00:01:21.119> as<00:01:21.360> much<00:01:21.540> as<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.750> used<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.350> which

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
can't eat as much as you used to which

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.289 
can't eat as much as you used to which
sounds<00:01:23.430> terrible

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
sounds terrible

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.120 
sounds terrible
and<00:01:24.390> I'm<00:01:24.540> already<00:01:24.869> dreading<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.409> this<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.009> why

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
and I'm already dreading it this is why

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.590 
and I'm already dreading it this is why
some<00:01:26.369> older<00:01:26.640> folks<00:01:26.850> put<00:01:27.060> on<00:01:27.180> weight<00:01:27.390> they

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
some older folks put on weight they

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.469 
some older folks put on weight they
don't<00:01:27.780> react<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:29.040> their<00:01:29.490> slower<00:01:29.700> metabolism

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
don't react to their slower metabolism

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.030 
don't react to their slower metabolism
you<00:01:30.720> also<00:01:30.960> don't<00:01:31.140> really<00:01:31.229> see<00:01:31.470> pop<00:01:31.680> buildings

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
you also don't really see pop buildings

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.069 
you also don't really see pop buildings
in<00:01:32.189> women<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.790> that's<00:01:33.090> because<00:01:33.420> women<00:01:33.810> tend

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
in women and that's because women tend

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.319 
in women and that's because women tend
to<00:01:34.140> store<00:01:34.350> fat<00:01:34.650> in<00:01:34.920> their<00:01:35.189> hips<00:01:35.579> their<00:01:35.759> thighs

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
jiggly it's kind of hard like you could

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.179
