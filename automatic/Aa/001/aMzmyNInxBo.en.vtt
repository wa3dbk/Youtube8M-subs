actually<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.539> Sieber<00:00:55.379> Fang<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.070> just<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
actually a Sieber Fang it is just the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.580 
actually a Sieber Fang it is just the
cancer<00:00:56.760> it's<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.149> bit<00:00:57.300> misleading<00:00:57.480> there<00:00:58.109> but

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
cancer it's a bit misleading there but

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.610 
cancer it's a bit misleading there but
basically<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.250> still<00:00:59.640> pretty<00:00:59.789> awesome<00:01:00.620> so

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
basically it is still pretty awesome so

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.340 
basically it is still pretty awesome so
what<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:01.980> does<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.550> if<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.449> are<00:01:03.629> within<00:01:04.019> six

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
what it does is if you are within six

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.340 
what it does is if you are within six
metres<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.460> can<00:01:05.760> apply<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.450> buff<00:01:06.930> it's

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
metres of it you can apply a buff it's

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.929 
metres of it you can apply a buff it's
pretty<00:01:07.619> important<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.159> when<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.610> initially

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
pretty important that when you initially

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.120 
pretty important that when you initially
use<00:01:09.210> this<00:01:09.420> ability<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.500> are<00:01:10.740> literally

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
use this ability that you are literally

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.740 
use this ability that you are literally
right<00:01:11.580> next<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.240> cat

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
right next to the cat

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.929 
right next to the cat
now<00:01:13.110> what<00:01:13.320> this<00:01:13.470> buff<00:01:13.710> does<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.520> gives<00:01:14.700> you

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
now what this buff does is it gives you

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.109 
now what this buff does is it gives you
a<00:01:14.970> 5%<00:01:15.479> movement<00:01:16.470> speed<00:01:16.979> increase<00:01:17.460> just<00:01:17.880> base

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
a 5% movement speed increase just base

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.710 
a 5% movement speed increase just base
and<00:01:18.560> it<00:01:19.560> gives<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.009> 30%<00:01:20.670> movement<00:01:21.420> speed

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
and it gives you a 30% movement speed

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.780 
and it gives you a 30% movement speed
increase<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.799> movement<00:01:23.610> speed

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
increase so that movement speed

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.060 
increase so that movement speed
increases<00:01:24.450> if<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:25.140> are<00:01:25.320> carrying<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.799> trade

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
increases if you are carrying a trade

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.399 
increases if you are carrying a trade
back<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:26.970> for<00:01:27.180> people<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.540> maybe<00:01:27.840> don't<00:01:27.960> yet

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
back so for people that maybe don't yet

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.230 
back so for people that maybe don't yet
have<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.619> donkey<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.189> need<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.610> do<00:01:29.729> trade<00:01:30.000> runs

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
have a donkey you need to do trade runs

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.200 
have a donkey you need to do trade runs
on<00:01:30.450> foot<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.960> can<00:01:31.229> do<00:01:31.409> them<00:01:31.619> faster<00:01:32.280> but<00:01:32.970> for

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
on foot you can do them faster but for

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.140 
on foot you can do them faster but for
people<00:01:33.600> like<00:01:33.900> myself<00:01:34.490> this<00:01:35.490> actually

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
people like myself this actually

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.060 
people like myself this actually
provides<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.659> competitive<00:01:37.049> advantage<00:01:37.500> in

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
provides a competitive advantage in

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.730 
provides a competitive advantage in
arena<00:01:38.369> for<00:01:39.060> example<00:01:39.540> at<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.900> start<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.290> arena

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
arena for example at the start of arena

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.060 
arena for example at the start of arena
especially<00:01:41.040> 1v1<00:01:42.200> but<00:01:43.200> what<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.470> can<00:01:43.710> do<00:01:43.860> as

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
especially 1v1 but what you can do as

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.530 
especially 1v1 but what you can do as
soon<00:01:44.250> as<00:01:44.369> you've<00:01:44.520> dropped<00:01:44.729> down<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.240> some<00:01:45.450> of

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
soon as you've dropped down you some of

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.870 
soon as you've dropped down you some of
the<00:01:45.630> black<00:01:45.840> can<00:01:46.200> use<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:46.799> ability<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.579> boom

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
the black can use this ability and boom

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.450 
the black can use this ability and boom
you<00:01:48.509> have<00:01:48.750> 5%<00:01:49.320> increased<00:01:49.920> movement<00:01:50.130> speed

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
you have 5% increased movement speed

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.350 
you have 5% increased movement speed
that<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.420> 5%<00:01:52.020> more<00:01:52.619> than<00:01:52.979> your<00:01:53.159> opponent<00:01:53.850> so

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
that is 5% more than your opponent so

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.420 
that is 5% more than your opponent so
while<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.899> not<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.170> huge<00:01:55.500> advantage<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.369> is

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
while it is not a huge advantage it is

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.880 
while it is not a huge advantage it is
that<00:01:56.759> little<00:01:57.090> bit<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.659> movement<00:01:57.840> speed<00:01:58.259> that
