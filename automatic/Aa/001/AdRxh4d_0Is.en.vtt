gonna be hard it took me 12 years to get
a<00:04:07.610> four-year<00:04:07.910> degree<00:04:08.090> but<00:04:08.690> I<00:04:08.750> got<00:04:09.050> it<00:04:09.260> and

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
a four-year degree but I got it and

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.930 
a four-year degree but I got it and
guess<00:04:09.650> what<00:04:09.860> on<00:04:09.980> a<00:04:10.010> degree<00:04:10.340> they<00:04:10.610> don't<00:04:10.760> have

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
guess what on a degree they don't have

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.660 
guess what on a degree they don't have
dates<00:04:11.410> so<00:04:12.410> if<00:04:12.530> it<00:04:12.620> took<00:04:12.770> you<00:04:12.830> born<00:04:13.250> it<00:04:13.400> took<00:04:13.550> me

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
dates so if it took you born it took me

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.320 
dates so if it took you born it took me
12<00:04:13.910> and<00:04:14.120> don't<00:04:14.270> show<00:04:14.450> up<00:04:14.570> nowhere<00:04:16.239> but<00:04:17.239> I'm
