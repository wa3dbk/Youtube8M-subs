00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
pretty much sure that the thing specs

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.799 
pretty much sure that the thing specs
between<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.670> two<00:00:59.820> games<00:01:00.059> he<00:01:00.239> was<00:01:00.390> locked<00:01:00.600> into

between the two games he was locked into
one<00:01:00.989> move<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.379> they're<00:01:01.500> all<00:01:01.649> special<00:01:01.890> attacks

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
one move and they're all special attacks

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.670 
one move and they're all special attacks
and<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:03.149> makes<00:01:03.300> no<00:01:03.480> sense<00:01:03.510> for<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.960> Garchomp<00:01:04.409> to

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
and it makes no sense for a Garchomp to

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.020 
and it makes no sense for a Garchomp to
be<00:01:04.830> doing<00:01:05.100> these<00:01:05.250> things<00:01:05.430> if<00:01:05.640> it's<00:01:05.820> not<00:01:06.000> specs

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:45.870 
because I mean I knew I figured that
thing<00:05:44.650> was<00:05:44.770> faster<00:05:45.100> than<00:05:45.130> me<00:05:45.250> anyway<00:05:45.610> and<00:05:45.760> at

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
thing was faster than me anyway and at

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.710 
thing was faster than me anyway and at
this<00:05:46.030> point<00:05:46.740> the<00:05:47.740> only<00:05:47.770> thing<00:05:48.160> that<00:05:48.400> I<00:05:48.720> could

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
this point the only thing that I could

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.600 
this point the only thing that I could
have<00:05:49.810> really<00:05:49.990> used<00:05:50.020> it<00:05:50.320> against<00:05:50.650> was<00:05:50.860> Lucario

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
have really used it against was Lucario

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.580 
have really used it against was Lucario
but<00:05:52.300> because<00:05:52.570> I<00:05:52.660> don't<00:05:52.840> have<00:05:52.930> extreme<00:05:53.320> speed

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 
but because I don't have extreme speed

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.330 
but because I don't have extreme speed
on<00:05:53.740> it<00:05:53.890> and<00:05:54.210> because<00:05:55.290> I<00:05:56.290> think<00:05:56.740> everything<00:05:57.250> he

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:57.340 
on it and because I think everything he

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.370 
on it and because I think everything he
has<00:05:57.460> is<00:05:57.610> faster<00:05:58.090> than<00:05:58.210> me<00:05:58.270> I<00:05:58.540> wouldn't<00:05:59.290> have

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
has is faster than me I wouldn't have

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.980 
has is faster than me I wouldn't have
gotten<00:05:59.530> a<00:05:59.620> Morning<00:05:59.890> Sun<00:06:00.070> off<00:06:00.220> anyway<00:06:00.840> so<00:06:01.840> he

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
gotten a Morning Sun off anyway so he

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.750 
gotten a Morning Sun off anyway so he
gets<00:06:02.170> to<00:06:02.230> a<00:06:02.680> crit<00:06:03.100> with<00:06:03.190> one<00:06:03.370> of<00:06:03.460> his<00:06:03.520> sweep

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
gets to a crit with one of his sweep

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.030 
gets to a crit with one of his sweep
slaps<00:06:04.060> brings<00:06:04.840> me<00:06:04.960> down<00:06:05.080> pretty<00:06:05.350> low<00:06:05.470> and

slaps brings me down pretty low and

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.360 
slaps brings me down pretty low and
useless<00:06:06.940> crit<00:06:07.360> there<00:06:07.540> was<00:06:07.660> a<00:06:07.690> useless<00:06:07.990> because
