you're ready to glue both pieces
together<00:01:09.490> by<00:01:10.450> applying<00:01:11.080> a<00:01:11.350> little<00:01:11.620> bit<00:01:11.770> of

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
together by applying a little bit of

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.440 
together by applying a little bit of
water<00:01:12.570> at<00:01:13.570> the<00:01:13.840> edge<00:01:14.020> of<00:01:14.729> Europe<00:01:15.729> easy<00:01:16.120> you

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
water at the edge of Europe easy you

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.250 
water at the edge of Europe easy you
just<00:01:16.780> created<00:01:17.260> number<00:01:17.830> two<00:01:18.340> and<00:01:18.930> you're<00:01:19.930> going

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
just created number two and you're going

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.050 
just created number two and you're going
to<00:01:20.320> mold<00:01:20.710> this<00:01:21.220> to<00:01:21.760> your<00:01:22.090> soul<00:01:23.520> like<00:01:24.520> that<00:01:24.790> and

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
to mold this to your soul like that and

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.980 
to mold this to your soul like that and
as<00:01:25.990> I<00:01:26.320> say<00:01:26.619> in<00:01:26.920> all<00:01:27.250> my<00:01:27.369> shoe<00:01:28.090> tutorials<00:01:28.690> it's

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
as I say in all my shoe tutorials it's

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.350 
as I say in all my shoe tutorials it's
very<00:01:29.260> important<00:01:29.830> that<00:01:30.160> you<00:01:30.369> let<00:01:30.580> your<00:01:30.790> pieces

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
very important that you let your pieces

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.560 
very important that you let your pieces
once<00:01:31.690> you<00:01:32.500> cut<00:01:32.800> them<00:01:33.070> dry<00:01:33.550> a<00:01:33.820> little<00:01:34.030> bit<00:01:34.210> air

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
once you cut them dry a little bit air

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.999 
once you cut them dry a little bit air
dry<00:01:34.990> so<00:01:35.619> this<00:01:35.830> is<00:01:36.009> much<00:01:36.490> easier<00:01:36.729> to<00:01:37.680> mold<00:01:38.680> it

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
dry so this is much easier to mold it

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.130 
dry so this is much easier to mold it
after<00:01:39.670> to<00:01:39.940> your<00:01:40.060> sole<00:01:40.360> see<00:01:40.660> I<00:01:40.690> don't<00:01:40.840> need

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
after to your sole see I don't need

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.400 
after to your sole see I don't need
anything<00:01:41.729> inside<00:01:42.729> to<00:01:43.090> hold<00:01:43.360> my<00:01:43.540> pieces<00:01:44.050> but

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
anything inside to hold my pieces but

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.560 
anything inside to hold my pieces but
obviously<00:01:45.009> one<00:01:45.430> thing<00:01:45.640> it's<00:01:45.820> very<00:01:45.880> important

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
obviously one thing it's very important

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.100 
obviously one thing it's very important
if<00:01:46.720> you're<00:01:47.200> using<00:01:47.440> gum<00:01:47.920> paste<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:49.360> cannot<00:01:49.600> dry

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
if you're using gum paste you cannot dry

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.270 
if you're using gum paste you cannot dry
it<00:01:50.170> as<00:01:50.470> longer<00:01:51.340> as<00:01:51.520> fondant<00:01:52.710> because<00:01:53.710> gum

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
it as longer as fondant because gum

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.840 
it as longer as fondant because gum
paste<00:01:54.580> dries<00:01:55.090> quickly<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:57.250> just<00:01:57.460> make<00:01:57.610> sure

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
paste dries quickly so just make sure

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.260 
paste dries quickly so just make sure
that<00:01:57.880> if<00:01:58.840> you're<00:01:59.050> using<00:01:59.080> gum<00:01:59.770> paste<00:02:00.070> to<00:02:00.970> just

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
that if you're using gum paste to just

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.170 
that if you're using gum paste to just
let<00:02:01.509> it<00:02:01.660> dry<00:02:01.840> couple<00:02:02.530> of<00:02:02.649> minutes<00:02:03.039> not<00:02:03.369> like<00:02:04.030> I

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
let it dry couple of minutes not like I

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.480 
let it dry couple of minutes not like I
would<00:02:04.450> normally<00:02:04.990> do<00:02:05.170> it<00:02:05.350> font<00:02:05.710> on<00:02:05.890> fifteen

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
would normally do it font on fifteen

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.699 
would normally do it font on fifteen
minutes<00:02:06.940> so<00:02:07.210> once<00:02:07.539> you've<00:02:07.750> cut<00:02:08.019> number<00:02:08.229> three

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
minutes so once you've cut number three

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.680 
minutes so once you've cut number three
you're<00:02:09.220> going<00:02:09.399> to<00:02:09.519> stitch<00:02:09.760> your<00:02:10.149> piece<00:02:10.479> all

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
you're going to stitch your piece all

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.449 
you're going to stitch your piece all
the<00:02:10.869> way<00:02:10.959> around<00:02:11.260> just<00:02:11.680> like<00:02:11.799> you<00:02:11.950> did<00:02:12.160> with

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
the way around just like you did with

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.150 
the way around just like you did with
number<00:02:13.150> two<00:02:13.420> and<00:02:13.720> then<00:02:14.620> you're<00:02:14.799> going<00:02:15.040> to

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
number two and then you're going to

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.880 
number two and then you're going to
create<00:02:15.549> little<00:02:15.850> holes<00:02:16.330> so<00:02:16.959> on<00:02:17.200> your<00:02:17.380> tablet

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
create little holes so on your tablet

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.190 
create little holes so on your tablet
you're<00:02:18.070> going<00:02:18.220> to<00:02:18.280> see<00:02:18.549> there's<00:02:19.269> a<00:02:19.570> guideline

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
you're going to see there's a guideline

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.500 
you're going to see there's a guideline
where<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:20.799> just<00:02:21.070> press<00:02:21.459> and<00:02:21.700> create<00:02:22.239> two

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
where you just press and create two

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.789 
where you just press and create two
creases<00:02:23.170> that<00:02:24.390> I<00:02:25.390> have<00:02:25.750> made<00:02:26.019> right<00:02:26.380> here<00:02:26.620> just

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
length you will need to measure from one

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.110 
length you will need to measure from one
end<00:03:09.120> to<00:03:09.390> another<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:10.440> then<00:03:11.190> to<00:03:11.430> this<00:03:11.610> point

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
end to another and then to this point

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.580 
end to another and then to this point
you're<00:03:12.480> going<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:12.840> apply<00:03:13.140> a<00:03:13.170> little<00:03:13.290> bit<00:03:13.500> of

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
you're going to apply a little bit of

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.920 
you're going to apply a little bit of
water<00:03:13.830> on<00:03:14.160> each<00:03:14.550> side<00:03:15.860> inside<00:03:17.330> the<00:03:18.330> holes<00:03:18.720> that

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
water on each side inside the holes that

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.960 
water on each side inside the holes that
you<00:03:18.989> created<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:19.890> you're<00:03:20.099> going<00:03:20.489> to<00:03:20.730> just

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
you created and you're going to just

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.050 
you created and you're going to just
stick<00:03:21.300> your<00:03:22.140> fondant<00:03:22.860> in<00:03:23.130> there<00:03:23.550> you<00:03:23.849> can<00:03:24.030> use

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
stick your fondant in there you can use

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.130 
stick your fondant in there you can use
a<00:03:24.510> tool<00:03:25.040> make<00:03:26.040> sure<00:03:26.069> that<00:03:26.550> is<00:03:26.760> inside<00:03:27.660> the<00:03:27.720> hole

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
a tool make sure that is inside the hole

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.600 
a tool make sure that is inside the hole
so<00:03:28.440> that<00:03:28.709> it<00:03:29.190> looks<00:03:29.580> like<00:03:30.510> it's<00:03:31.140> really<00:03:31.769> inside

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
so that it looks like it's really inside

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.650 
so that it looks like it's really inside
and<00:03:32.940> then<00:03:33.870> you're<00:03:34.049> going<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.470> do<00:03:34.650> that<00:03:35.660> with

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
and then you're going to do that with

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.039 
and then you're going to do that with
the<00:03:36.930> top<00:03:37.200> one<00:03:37.910> also<00:03:38.910> a<00:03:39.150> little<00:03:39.540> bit<00:03:39.660> of<00:03:39.780> water

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
the top one also a little bit of water

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.530 
the top one also a little bit of water
on<00:03:40.410> each<00:03:40.920> side<00:03:41.310> and<00:03:41.870> again<00:03:42.870> take<00:03:43.590> your<00:03:43.620> fondant

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
on each side and again take your fondant

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:57.280 
on each side and again take your fondant
and<00:03:47.299> glue<00:03:48.299> it<00:03:48.709> to<00:03:49.709> your<00:03:49.739> piece

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.559 

so<00:03:58.280> then<00:03:58.430> you're<00:03:58.610> going<00:03:58.700> to<00:03:58.790> take<00:03:59.030> a<00:03:59.180> longer

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
so then you're going to take a longer

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.069 
so then you're going to take a longer
stripe<00:04:00.230> and<00:04:00.560> what<00:04:01.430> you<00:04:01.579> will<00:04:01.760> do<00:04:02.030> is<00:04:02.299> squeeze

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
stripe and what you will do is squeeze

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:08.979 
stripe and what you will do is squeeze
the<00:04:03.470> ends<00:04:04.390> on<00:04:05.500> each<00:04:06.500> and<00:04:06.920> one<00:04:07.400> of<00:04:07.549> them<00:04:07.760> so<00:04:08.750> that

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
the ends on each and one of them so that

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.190 
the ends on each and one of them so that
you<00:04:09.920> will<00:04:10.549> actually<00:04:11.239> will<00:04:11.599> give<00:04:11.810> you<00:04:11.989> that

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
you will actually will give you that

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.240 
you will actually will give you that
really<00:04:13.069> nice<00:04:13.310> effect<00:04:13.940> on<00:04:14.470> your<00:04:15.470> shoelace<00:04:15.950> and

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
really nice effect on your shoelace and

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:22.540 
really nice effect on your shoelace and
then<00:04:16.699> you're<00:04:17.600> going<00:04:18.019> to<00:04:18.760> really<00:04:20.919> squeeze<00:04:21.919> the

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
then you're going to really squeeze the

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.400 
then you're going to really squeeze the
middle<00:04:22.789> part<00:04:23.210> of<00:04:23.360> it<00:04:23.479> so<00:04:23.690> you<00:04:23.750> get<00:04:24.020> something

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
middle part of it so you get something

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.360 
middle part of it so you get something
like<00:04:24.620> this<00:04:24.800> and<00:04:25.340> in<00:04:25.940> this<00:04:26.240> part<00:04:26.690> again<00:04:27.380> using<00:04:28.310> a

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
like this and in this part again using a

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.360 
like this and in this part again using a
little<00:04:28.400> bit<00:04:28.729> of<00:04:28.880> water<00:04:29.180> you're<00:04:30.169> going<00:04:30.680> to<00:04:30.949> glue

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
little bit of water you're going to glue

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.510 
little bit of water you're going to glue
it<00:04:31.400> in<00:04:31.789> the<00:04:32.030> middle<00:04:32.539> of<00:04:32.830> your<00:04:33.830> shoe<00:04:34.160> that<00:04:34.310> you

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
it in the middle of your shoe that you

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.990 
it in the middle of your shoe that you
just<00:04:35.260> created<00:04:36.260> right<00:04:36.560> here<00:04:36.919> oops<00:04:37.460> I'm<00:04:37.669> missing

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
just created right here oops I'm missing

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.080 
just created right here oops I'm missing
a<00:04:38.060> little<00:04:38.180> bit<00:04:38.389> of<00:04:38.479> water<00:04:41.860> like<00:04:42.860> the<00:04:43.490> soap<00:04:43.850> and

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
a little bit of water like the soap and

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.779 
a little bit of water like the soap and
then<00:04:44.510> if<00:04:44.690> you<00:04:44.840> want<00:04:45.110> these<00:04:45.320> to<00:04:45.590> be<00:04:45.620> more<00:04:46.190> open

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:46.789 
then if you want these to be more open

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:49.180 
then if you want these to be more open
you<00:04:47.510> can<00:04:47.930> put<00:04:48.350> a<00:04:48.380> little<00:04:48.620> bit<00:04:48.770> of<00:04:48.979> water

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
you can put a little bit of water

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.050 
you can put a little bit of water
wherever<00:04:49.729> you<00:04:50.180> want<00:04:50.449> and<00:04:50.810> just<00:04:51.620> put<00:04:51.860> your<00:04:52.220> lace

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.890 

technique<00:04:59.780> where<00:05:00.050> you<00:05:00.260> can<00:05:00.530> actually<00:05:00.860> have

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
technique where you can actually have

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.779 
technique where you can actually have
crashing<00:05:02.900> a<00:05:02.990> little<00:05:03.320> bit<00:05:03.440> loops<00:05:03.740> so<00:05:04.460> to<00:05:04.520> create

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:04.789 
crashing a little bit loops so to create

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:06.909 
crashing a little bit loops so to create
the<00:05:05.120> loops<00:05:05.360> what<00:05:05.750> you<00:05:05.870> need<00:05:06.080> to<00:05:06.199> do<00:05:06.380> is<00:05:06.620> cut

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
the loops what you need to do is cut

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:08.980 
the loops what you need to do is cut
another<00:05:07.280> stripe<00:05:07.729> and<00:05:08.030> this<00:05:08.210> is<00:05:08.360> depends<00:05:08.840> of

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
another stripe and this is depends of
