what<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.810> power<00:01:16.170> enhancer<00:01:16.830> does<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.670> it

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
what the power enhancer does is that it

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.690 
what the power enhancer does is that it
increases<00:01:18.950> the<00:01:20.119> combustion<00:01:21.119> pressure<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:22.700> in

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
increases the combustion pressure and in

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.890 
increases the combustion pressure and in
doing<00:01:24.510> so<00:01:25.280> it<00:01:26.280> allows<00:01:26.610> for<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:27.060> more<00:01:27.330> consistent

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
doing so it allows for a more consistent
