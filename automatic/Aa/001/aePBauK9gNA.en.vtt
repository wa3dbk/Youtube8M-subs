00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.859
 he is definitely an outrageous guy and 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.469
 the beauty among the compact suv 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:13.070
 allow range rover evoque in only 18 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.690
 months the baby range was sold 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:19.740
 170,000 times and is the best-selling 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.769
 model of the brand for 2015 was the body 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.570
 cent over worked beguiled evoque yet 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.869
 especially by its optical stimuli 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.740
 was screwed to these only a little 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.810
 innovations are mainly in 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.700
 from a technical point of view, a new course 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.890
 automatic should be the speed level and 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.250
 thus significantly reducing consumption 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.430
 a look at the datasheet as st4 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.320
 makes the evoque 190 ps contented 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.370
 loudly with six liters of diesel and 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:53.100
 drives a maximum of 195 km / h in the top 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:55.500
 he is from 38 1200 euro range rover 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.320
 evoque sd4 actually know the car 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.730
 already 190 ps why goes too 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.039
 accordingly neat what 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.359
 new is that a new gang 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.460
 Automatik got in the course of the 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.689
 facelifts private of the six courses 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.570
 the new gears should now be more 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.700
 switching comfort better consumption and 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.780
 Overall, a better adaptation of the 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.180
 power in advancing 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.890
 What immediately stands out is he lays nice 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.240
 are the gears after so must really 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.190
 pay attention to the tachometer because 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.780
 Unfortunately, the digital display does not show 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.950
 which gear is engaged but if you 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.140
 Watch the rev counter then sees 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.640
 one jumps zack zack zack we the 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.049
 changes gears and not just here 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.580
 a sequential one after the 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.890
 others after but also through 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.119
 you have to a few gears skips what 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.390
 He really makes it so great 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.909
 imperceptibly the new stages automatic 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.570
 but also costs just under 2300 euros 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.600
 more 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.430
 compared with the six-speed box 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.450
 of course, that's crucial days 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.509
 car also economical 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.030
 zf promises up to 16 percent 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:55.390
 Savings range rover says well 4 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.220
 percent we measured 6.7 liters 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.350
 has been doing very economical 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.880
 consumed that is not world-class now 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.819
 but also no wonder because the car 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.789
 weighs over 1.8 tonnes and the evoque 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:08.979
 after all, it also provides 190 ps 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:12.090
 the mother is even very cultivated 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:15.670
 I have to listen closely to the diesel engine 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.980
 190 ps of course, lots of wood but you 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.660
 also meet 18 tons 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.400
 and you can feel it especially if 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.709
 you start driving for the first time at the moment 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.180
 there has the range rover needs such a 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.070
 gets a little better going 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.299
 What you notice is the ranger altogether 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.060
 be in the car a bit more 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:33.400
 soldo athletic behavior lays comfort 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.049
 There are certainly better in the suv 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.790
 class 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:40.020
 but then they wear a less 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.910
 extraordinary face 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.470
 at the facelift securing interior 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.850
 a little something has done a few now 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.310
 new alu decor 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.990
 the color palette should be new what we 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.000
 but more interested is the navi 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.160
 system that is the previous one 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.050
 and there it is better 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.310
 the market is a bit slow too 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.960
 The presentation is stale 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.700
 there must be something new ago the evoque is yes 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.410
 a bestseller is really good 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.750
 although the car just does not work now 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.710
 perfect is a bit heavy as well 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.240
 not necessarily the practical one 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.890
 special class but looks great and 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.900
 Range rover just a great one at that time 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.660
 job done as the study really does 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.010
 Great looked almost unchanged open 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.720
 small details taken in the series 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.860
 has to like the people that buy 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.860
 she likes to like me on
