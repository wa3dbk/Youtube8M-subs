00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:31.759
 turns Panova accepts congratulations 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.189

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.860
 seconds before the fifth player goes on the ice 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:40.009
 not the second majority in Chelyabinsk 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:45.950
 more intelligibly turned out where 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:48.890
 more effective and main outcome of the game in 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:53.270

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.390
 Sprinkle Grigoriev 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.260
 but 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:11.220
 clogs from flying they all flew into 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:13.290
 Astana except for the Cossacks for his 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.330
 here is a dangerous moment once the apparatus and the puck 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.959
 in the grid like this 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.170
 exe vasilchenko says hello 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:25.080
 Kazakhstan , the national team player 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.020
 grieves and so does qc 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.520
 excellent transfer to Vasilchenko 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:33.120
 which turns out to be eye to eye 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:37.010
 he saw the fact that he took over the puck and qc 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:41.370
 i was on the lazy blue type 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.620
 waiting position barys nishushkin 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.980
 throw the ball one more thrust 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.650
 misses me closer to the gate not 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.860
 it turns out to do it but in the past 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.870
 Barys season almost made a splash 2 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.550

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:12.510
 barys wake up 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.510
 What transfer and throw successfully on battle until 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:20.620
 but had now possible in the home 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.330
 principle is always when the battle link in the ice 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:26.110
 yes yes learn bachinsky always very 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:29.830
 dangerous here now and the time of the beginning of the Dawes 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:32.860
 the gate area slid it 2 in 1 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.830
 Chelyabinsk attack dangerous moment throw 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.940

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:41.100
 response transmission of Maxim Karpov on 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:46.610

 empty corner of the gate who's there dugin was 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:54.470
 let's watch this episode repeat until 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:58.280
 14 Number Dugin Gives Saved Corr 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.860
 there will be a return transmission eremeev not 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.150

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.480
 great here played this 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:08.740
 a combination well and I of that period for 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:12.350
 dangerous goods aku raised stick but 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:15.170
 nothing in principle dangerous Chelyabinsk not 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.870
 created this more response in an hour 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:21.450
 stop the arbitrators meeting and 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:25.310
 It begins with us here brawl Act 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:30.230
 Vasilchenko and service number three to him 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:33.030
 Lynx opposes Troshchinsky such here 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:35.970
 a situation without which probably 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.230
 and one match high percentage of sales 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.480
 throws and fight 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.670
 In general, in principle , this season the team 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:45.480
 better dangerous moment what a throw on 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:47.700
 the gate of the gentry and barely another now 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.310
 puck don't get into it believes coming out 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:53.430
 twist here are mistaken now Astana residents 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:55.230
 at the exit of the watch zone of rock samples there 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.720
 not very confident catches the puck 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:00.520
 item details nonetheless discourage 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.169
 this roll is canceled 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:06.909
 and here is dmitry opera that will make 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:06.909
 base gear shot on goal 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:15.639
 falling very good rally into one 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:17.590
 touch here pucks from a good mood 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:20.410
 will be preparing for tomorrow's fight 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:22.990
 I remind you that they were treated by the owners and 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:27.000
 Konstantin Rudenko in translation in the first 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.000
