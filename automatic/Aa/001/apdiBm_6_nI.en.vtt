doings of a vampire but Sophie doesn't

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.179 
doings of a vampire but Sophie doesn't
want<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.110> believe<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.350> her<00:01:22.650> friend<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.100> doing

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
want to believe that her friend is doing

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.859 
want to believe that her friend is doing
all<00:01:23.369> these<00:01:23.460> terrible<00:01:23.700> things<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.240> she<00:01:24.330> does

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
all these terrible things so she does

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.020 
all these terrible things so she does
her<00:01:25.049> best<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.460> prove<00:01:26.460> her<00:01:27.090> innocent<00:01:27.659> but<00:01:29.030> not

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
her best to prove her innocent but not

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.460 
her best to prove her innocent but not
everybody<00:01:30.420> really<00:01:30.659> believes<00:01:30.900> for<00:01:31.110> everybody

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
everybody really believes for everybody

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.920 
everybody really believes for everybody
still<00:01:32.040> thinks<00:01:32.070> it's<00:01:32.430> Jenna<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.939> so<00:01:33.780> if<00:01:33.840> he

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
still thinks it's Jenna and so if he

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.319 
still thinks it's Jenna and so if he
doesn't<00:01:34.170> really<00:01:34.259> know<00:01:34.439> what<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.710> believe<00:01:34.829> and

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
doesn't really know what to believe and

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.760 
doesn't really know what to believe and
so<00:01:36.329> yeah<00:01:36.479> that's<00:01:36.630> basically<00:01:36.869> what<00:01:37.439> goes<00:01:37.560> down

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
so yeah that's basically what goes down

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.440 
so yeah that's basically what goes down
and<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:39.170> really<00:01:40.170> like<00:01:40.380> there<00:01:40.619> was<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:41.640> kind<00:01:42.270> of

and I really like there was to kind of

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.300
