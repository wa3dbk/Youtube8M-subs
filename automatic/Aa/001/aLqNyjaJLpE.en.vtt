the background as you can see of this

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.479 
the background as you can see of this
building<00:00:45.780> action<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.559> bit<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.800> an<00:00:46.920> older

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489

building action it is a bit of an older
video<00:00:47.789> but<00:00:48.450> Anton<00:00:48.899> was<00:00:49.170> kind<00:00:49.500> enough<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.770> let

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
video but Anton was kind enough to let

there'll<00:00:54.270> be<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.390> link<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:54.809> as<00:00:55.110> well<00:00:55.410> but

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
there'll be a link to that as well but

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.660 
there'll be a link to that as well but
yeah<00:00:55.860> it's<00:00:56.010> really<00:00:56.070> just<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.460> give<00:00:56.610> you

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
yeah it's really just to give you

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.700 
yeah it's really just to give you
something<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.300> look<00:00:57.449> at<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.899> give<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.469> bit

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
something to look at and give you a bit

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.930 
something to look at and give you a bit
of<00:00:58.739> more<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.039> an<00:00:59.129> idea<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.520> how<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.699> class

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
of more of an idea of how the class

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.490 
of more of an idea of how the class
plays<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.840> what<00:01:01.050> it's<00:01:01.170> going<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.320> look<00:01:01.440> like

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
plays and what it's going to look like

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.100 
plays and what it's going to look like
so<00:01:02.070> here<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.699> build<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.180> uses<00:01:03.510> archery

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
so here is the build it uses archery

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.830 
so here is the build it uses archery
shadow<00:01:04.470> play<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.129> or<00:01:05.400> mansi<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.210> combine<00:01:06.570> to

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
shadow play and or mansi to combine to

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.149 
shadow play and or mansi to combine to
make<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.020> primeval

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
make the primeval

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.399 
make the primeval
I<00:01:08.189> assume<00:01:08.729> it's<00:01:08.909> primeval<00:01:09.390> might<00:01:09.960> be<00:01:10.080> prime

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
I assume it's primeval might be prime

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.740 
I assume it's primeval might be prime
'evil<00:01:10.979> kind<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.760> thing<00:01:11.909> I'm<00:01:12.119> not<00:01:12.299> sure<00:01:12.479> it

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
'evil kind of thing I'm not sure it

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.240 
'evil kind of thing I'm not sure it
looks<00:01:12.930> like<00:01:13.049> should<00:01:13.229> be<00:01:13.260> primeval<00:01:13.770> anyway<00:01:14.189> so

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
looks like should be primeval anyway so

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.800 
looks like should be primeval anyway so
that's<00:01:14.430> how<00:01:14.640> we<00:01:14.700> keep<00:01:14.970> pronouncing<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.659> I'll

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
that's how we keep pronouncing it I'll

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.240 
that's how we keep pronouncing it I'll
make<00:01:16.049> sure<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.320> link<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.680> description<00:01:17.159> is

make sure the link in the description is

make sure the link in the description is

want to take a few passes out of shadow
play<00:03:04.230> I'd<00:03:04.380> recommend<00:03:04.890> then<00:03:05.280> you<00:03:05.430> could<00:03:05.670> grab<00:03:05.880> a

play I'd recommend then you could grab a
few<00:03:06.120> more<00:03:06.180> or<00:03:06.390> emergency<00:03:06.780> abilities<00:03:07.200> but<00:03:07.530> as<00:03:07.739> I

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
few more or emergency abilities but as I

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.589 
few more or emergency abilities but as I
said<00:03:07.890> I<00:03:08.040> am<00:03:08.160> a<00:03:08.310> passive<00:03:08.640> halt<00:03:08.790> right<00:03:08.819> like<00:03:09.450> I

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
said I am a passive halt right like I

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.180 
said I am a passive halt right like I
love<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.930> passive<00:03:10.319> so<00:03:10.530> in<00:03:10.650> shadow<00:03:10.920> play

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
love the passive so in shadow play

love the passive so in shadow play
there's<00:03:11.400> obviously<00:03:11.700> quite<00:03:11.760> a<00:03:11.970> few<00:03:12.239> abilities

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
the main ones are going to be obviously

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.370 
the main ones are going to be obviously
stealth<00:03:14.790> just<00:03:15.150> comes<00:03:15.360> and<00:03:15.540> so<00:03:15.720> handy<00:03:16.170> in<00:03:16.230> all

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
stealth just comes and so handy in all

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.530 
stealth just comes and so handy in all
aspects<00:03:17.010> of<00:03:17.130> our<00:03:17.280> cage<00:03:17.579> stalkers<00:03:18.209> marks<00:03:18.480> a

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
aspects of our cage stalkers marks a

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.240 
aspects of our cage stalkers marks a
good<00:03:18.720> one<00:03:18.870> it<00:03:19.079> gives<00:03:19.440> you<00:03:19.530> just<00:03:19.650> a<00:03:19.829> large

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
increase in damage all-round you've got

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.720 
increase in damage all-round you've got
drop<00:03:22.410> back<00:03:22.620> which<00:03:22.829> is<00:03:22.980> just<00:03:23.220> really<00:03:23.430> another

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
movement ability it's going to let you

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.349 
movement ability it's going to let you
teleport<00:03:25.980> around<00:03:26.160> a<00:03:26.280> bit<00:03:26.430> more<00:03:26.700> shadow

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
teleport around a bit more shadow

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.360 
teleport around a bit more shadow
stepping<00:03:27.900> out<00:03:27.989> a<00:03:28.019> little<00:03:28.320> teleport<00:03:28.890> there<00:03:29.160> and

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
stepping out a little teleport there and

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.099 
stepping out a little teleport there and
you<00:03:29.790> know<00:03:29.910> a<00:03:29.940> few<00:03:30.150> more<00:03:30.299> passive<00:03:30.780> just<00:03:31.019> you

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
you know a few more passive just you

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:32.690 
you know a few more passive just you
know<00:03:31.200> increasing<00:03:31.590> critical<00:03:32.130> rate<00:03:32.340> and<00:03:32.549> that

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
know increasing critical rate and that

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.370 
know increasing critical rate and that
kind<00:03:32.940> of<00:03:33.030> stuff<00:03:33.239> but<00:03:33.569> it<00:03:33.720> is<00:03:33.870> really<00:03:34.200> all<00:03:34.350> about

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
kind of stuff but it is really all about

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.960 
kind of stuff but it is really all about
the<00:03:34.709> endless<00:03:34.890> arrows<00:03:35.280> guys<00:03:35.549> so<00:03:35.760> I've<00:03:35.850> actually

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
the endless arrows guys so I've actually

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.610 
the endless arrows guys so I've actually
you<00:03:36.239> cut<00:03:36.390> that<00:03:36.540> key<00:03:36.720> down<00:03:36.870> to<00:03:37.079> a<00:03:37.109> key<00:03:37.350> that<00:03:37.530> you

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
you cut that key down to a key that you

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.590 
you cut that key down to a key that you
can<00:03:37.769> reach<00:03:38.069> really<00:03:38.519> easily<00:03:38.940> and<00:03:39.180> that<00:03:39.209> you<00:03:39.450> can

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
can reach really easily and that you can

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.210 
can reach really easily and that you can
use<00:03:39.750> a<00:03:39.780> lot<00:03:40.079> without<00:03:40.230> it<00:03:40.470> being<00:03:40.590> annoying<00:03:40.890> now

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
use a lot without it being annoying now

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.590 
use a lot without it being annoying now
you<00:03:41.280> don't<00:03:41.549> want<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:41.760> play<00:03:41.880> this<00:03:42.000> class<00:03:42.329> if<00:03:42.510> you

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
you don't want to play this class if you

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.449 
you don't want to play this class if you
have<00:03:42.660> high<00:03:42.930> latency<00:03:43.410> because<00:03:43.620> unless<00:03:44.040> arrows

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
have high latency because unless arrows

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.699 
have high latency because unless arrows
is<00:03:44.670> quite<00:03:44.940> pin<00:03:45.269> dependent<00:03:45.840> and<00:03:45.989> it's<00:03:46.500> your

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
is quite pin dependent and it's your

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.050 
is quite pin dependent and it's your
main<00:03:46.859> ability<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:47.609> if<00:03:47.700> you're<00:03:47.819> really<00:03:47.970> a

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
main ability and if you're really a

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.030 
main ability and if you're really a
min/max<00:03:48.359> ER<00:03:48.900> then<00:03:49.290> you're<00:03:49.560> not<00:03:49.680> going<00:03:49.859> to<00:03:49.920> want

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
min/max ER then you're not going to want

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.620 
min/max ER then you're not going to want
to<00:03:50.130> run<00:03:50.310> this<00:03:50.459> because<00:03:50.819> the<00:03:50.910> latency<00:03:51.329> really

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
to run this because the latency really

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.539 
to run this because the latency really
does<00:03:51.810> just<00:03:52.019> slow<00:03:52.290> it<00:03:52.319> down<00:03:52.500> like<00:03:53.040> if<00:03:53.280> you've

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
does just slow it down like if you've

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.460 
does just slow it down like if you've
got<00:03:53.730> low<00:03:53.850> latency<00:03:54.389> it's<00:03:54.690> just<00:03:54.840> like<00:03:54.959> a<00:03:54.989> machine

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
got low latency it's just like a machine

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.050 
got low latency it's just like a machine
gun<00:03:55.500> it's<00:03:55.950> just<00:03:56.130> you're<00:03:56.250> pumping<00:03:56.579> our<00:03:56.730> arrows

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
gun it's just you're pumping our arrows

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.000 
gun it's just you're pumping our arrows
constantly<00:03:57.720> but<00:03:58.109> if<00:03:58.200> you're<00:03:58.319> high<00:03:58.530> latency

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
constantly but if you're high latency

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.949 
constantly but if you're high latency
it's<00:03:59.400> more<00:03:59.639> like<00:03:59.790> using<00:04:00.090> your<00:04:00.269> shotgun<00:04:00.690> and

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
it's more like using your shotgun and

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.379 
it's more like using your shotgun and
it's<00:04:01.139> just<00:04:01.590> it's<00:04:01.829> nowhere<00:04:02.280> near<00:04:02.430> as<00:04:02.549> good<00:04:02.850> but

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
it's just it's nowhere near as good but

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:04.729 
it's just it's nowhere near as good but
you<00:04:03.569> know<00:04:03.660> if<00:04:03.780> you<00:04:03.959> really<00:04:04.319> want<00:04:04.500> to<00:04:04.560> play<00:04:04.709> a

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
you know if you really want to play a

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.650 
you know if you really want to play a
ranger<00:04:05.370> and<00:04:05.549> not<00:04:05.760> having<00:04:05.970> that<00:04:06.180> maximum

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
ranger and not having that maximum

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.000 
ranger and not having that maximum
damage<00:04:07.049> isn't<00:04:07.260> going<00:04:07.470> to<00:04:07.530> affect<00:04:07.620> you<00:04:07.859> too

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
damage isn't going to affect you too

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.590 
damage isn't going to affect you too
much<00:04:08.250> then<00:04:08.430> just<00:04:08.579> play<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:08.970> class<00:04:09.209> don't<00:04:09.420> let

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
much then just play the class don't let

00:04:32.239 --> 00:04:32.249 
lack in AoE though it's probably as big

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:34.640

one-on-one<00:04:36.629> situations<00:04:37.349> but<00:04:37.800> if<00:04:37.949> you're

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:38.069 
one-on-one situations but if you're
