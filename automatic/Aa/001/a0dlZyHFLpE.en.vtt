so<00:00:07.109> we've<00:00:07.560> got<00:00:07.740> to<00:00:07.919> rangefinders<00:00:08.519> that<00:00:08.639> with

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
so we've got to rangefinders that with

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.810 
so we've got to rangefinders that with
us<00:00:08.880> today<00:00:09.030> she's<00:00:09.929> got<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.139> vortex<00:00:10.550> the<00:00:11.550> Ranger

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
us today she's got the vortex the Ranger

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.140 
us today she's got the vortex the Ranger
1000<00:00:12.389> and<00:00:12.870> then<00:00:13.259> we've<00:00:13.410> also<00:00:13.590> got<00:00:14.690> the<00:00:15.690> Leica

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
1000 and then we've also got the Leica

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.929 
1000 and then we've also got the Leica
their<00:00:18.150> CRF<00:00:18.690> 800<00:00:19.460> we're<00:00:20.460> going<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.640> run<00:00:20.730> through

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
their CRF 800 we're going to run through

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.540 
their CRF 800 we're going to run through
a<00:00:21.000> quick<00:00:21.180> couple<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.750> stress<00:00:21.990> tests<00:00:22.369> do<00:00:23.369> some

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
a quick couple of stress tests do some

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.340 
a quick couple of stress tests do some
comparisons<00:00:24.029> between<00:00:24.150> them<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.990> see<00:00:25.170> what<00:00:25.260> we

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
comparisons between them and see what we

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.300 
comparisons between them and see what we
like<00:00:26.150> so<00:00:27.320> both<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.349> these<00:00:28.590> units<00:00:28.920> are<00:00:29.010> rated

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
like so both of these units are rated

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.659 
like so both of these units are rated
4000<00:00:29.939> yards<00:00:30.410> they're<00:00:31.410> both<00:00:31.679> running<00:00:31.980> with<00:00:32.640> a

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
4000 yards they're both running with a

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.760 
4000 yards they're both running with a
red<00:00:33.120> LED<00:00:33.660> on<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.899> inside<00:00:34.170> which<00:00:34.380> i<00:00:34.500> think<00:00:34.559> is

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
red LED on the inside which i think is

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:35.840 
red LED on the inside which i think is
really<00:00:34.950> important<00:00:35.309> if<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.550> ever<00:00:35.670> used

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
really important if you ever used

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.970 
really important if you ever used
something<00:00:36.059> with<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.270> black<00:00:36.480> LCD<00:00:37.020> display<00:00:37.410> it's

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
something with a black LCD display it's

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.040 
something with a black LCD display it's
really<00:00:38.190> easy<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.370> lose<00:00:38.550> track<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.820> them<00:00:39.090> the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
really easy to lose track of them the

vortex has what's called their HCD it's
essentially<00:00:55.230> compensating<00:00:56.010> for<00:00:56.129> your<00:00:56.250> angle

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
features in it which I kind of like I'll

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.009 
features in it which I kind of like I'll
get<00:01:02.340> into<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.579> later<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:03.210> can<00:01:03.539> get<00:01:03.780> them<00:01:03.930> to

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
get into that later I can get them to

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.850 
get into that later I can get them to
both<00:01:04.229> range<00:01:04.589> pretty<00:01:04.949> well<00:01:06.049> the<00:01:07.049> Leica<00:01:07.380> I've

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
both range pretty well the Leica I've

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.219 
both range pretty well the Leica I've
used<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.640> like<00:01:08.790> out<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.150> 900<00:01:09.600> yards<00:01:09.750> before

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
used the like out to 900 yards before

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.340 
used the like out to 900 yards before
today<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:10.979> can<00:01:11.220> only<00:01:11.340> get<00:01:11.490> 700<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.960> vortex

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
today I can only get 700 and the vortex

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.810 
today I can only get 700 and the vortex
well<00:01:13.560> they<00:01:13.650> claimed<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.920> be<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.159> thousand<00:01:14.580> yards

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
well they claimed to be a thousand yards

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.990 
well they claimed to be a thousand yards
like<00:01:14.970> everybody<00:01:15.600> does<00:01:15.920> I<00:01:16.920> can<00:01:17.460> only<00:01:17.610> get<00:01:17.820> them

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
like everybody does I can only get them

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.749 
like everybody does I can only get them
to<00:01:18.210> go<00:01:18.330> out<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:19.070> 650<00:01:20.070> from<00:01:20.250> what<00:01:20.400> I'm<00:01:20.490> looking

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
to go out to 650 from what I'm looking

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.730 
to go out to 650 from what I'm looking
at<00:01:20.820> around<00:01:20.970> me<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.960> that's<00:01:22.290> standard<00:01:22.470> for

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
at around me and that's standard for

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.280 
at around me and that's standard for
most<00:01:22.890> optics<00:01:23.280> companies<00:01:23.700> whatever<00:01:24.360> they<00:01:24.900> say

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
most optics companies whatever they say

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.010 
most optics companies whatever they say
you<00:01:25.890> can<00:01:26.070> take<00:01:26.189> off<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.430> little<00:01:26.670> bit<00:01:26.909> they<00:01:27.780> both

got lanyard attachments the vortex one

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.630

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
little bit thinner on the Leica but then

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.639 
little bit thinner on the Leica but then
we<00:01:44.430> get<00:01:44.520> into<00:01:44.670> some<00:01:44.909> serious<00:01:45.060> differences<00:01:45.649> the

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
we get into some serious differences the

rangefinder<00:02:03.000> I've<00:02:03.090> ever<00:02:03.210> seen<00:02:03.420> with<00:02:03.540> one<00:02:03.719> if

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
rangefinder I've ever seen with one if

you've<00:02:04.320> seen<00:02:04.530> my<00:02:04.649> review<00:02:04.799> on<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:06.149> mountain

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
you've seen my review on the mountain

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.199 
you've seen my review on the mountain
scope<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.380> Recon<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:07.979> really<00:02:08.879> like<00:02:09.060> this

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
scope the Recon I really like this

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.010 
scope the Recon I really like this
feature<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.599> use<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:09.989> lot

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020

you'll notice I have a couple of

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.950 
you'll notice I have a couple of
different<00:02:12.700> carry<00:02:13.120> systems<00:02:13.540> I<00:02:13.630> use<00:02:13.780> when

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
different carry systems I use when

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.780 
different carry systems I use when
moving<00:02:14.140> my<00:02:14.290> rangefinder<00:02:14.590> around<00:02:15.130> lots<00:02:15.670> of

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
moving my rangefinder around lots of

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:16.860 
moving my rangefinder around lots of
people<00:02:15.850> like<00:02:16.120> to<00:02:16.150> keep<00:02:16.330> it<00:02:16.480> in<00:02:16.570> the<00:02:16.660> upper

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
people like to keep it in the upper

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.650 
people like to keep it in the upper
breast<00:02:17.110> pocket<00:02:17.500> I<00:02:17.650> like<00:02:18.400> that<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:19.120> male<00:02:19.450> on

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
breast pocket I like that the male on

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.480 
breast pocket I like that the male on
the<00:02:19.720> belt<00:02:20.140> clip<00:02:20.260> means<00:02:20.560> that<00:02:20.710> I<00:02:20.740> can<00:02:20.950> pull<00:02:21.370> it

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
the belt clip means that I can pull it

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.580 
the belt clip means that I can pull it
and<00:02:21.640> put<00:02:22.180> it<00:02:22.270> away<00:02:22.480> without<00:02:23.110> even<00:02:23.470> really

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
and put it away without even really

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.300 
and put it away without even really
looking<00:02:23.890> at<00:02:24.040> it

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
looking at it

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.610 
looking at it
I've<00:02:25.090> used<00:02:25.390> that<00:02:25.510> Badlands<00:02:25.990> case<00:02:26.260> as<00:02:26.440> well

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
I've used that Badlands case as well

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.220 
I've used that Badlands case as well
which<00:02:27.430> is<00:02:27.460> nice<00:02:27.850> because<00:02:28.150> it<00:02:28.540> has<00:02:28.720> a<00:02:28.960> lanyard

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
which is nice because it has a lanyard

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.440 
which is nice because it has a lanyard
tie<00:02:29.590> if<00:02:29.830> you're<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:30.760> kind<00:02:30.880> of<00:02:30.970> person<00:02:31.030> who

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
tie if you're the kind of person who

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.660 
tie if you're the kind of person who
loses<00:02:31.900> things<00:02:32.320> or<00:02:32.530> leaves<00:02:32.740> things<00:02:33.070> I<00:02:33.280> would

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
loses things or leaves things I would

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.700 
loses things or leaves things I would
definitely<00:02:34.090> recommend<00:02:34.290> running<00:02:35.290> a<00:02:35.350> lanyard

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
definitely recommend running a lanyard

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.790 
definitely recommend running a lanyard
on<00:02:35.860> to<00:02:36.130> your<00:02:36.640> rangefinder<00:02:37.210> and<00:02:37.390> I<00:02:38.350> would<00:02:38.530> never

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
on to your rangefinder and I would never

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.890 
on to your rangefinder and I would never
buy<00:02:39.070> a<00:02:39.100> rangefinder<00:02:39.940> in<00:02:40.030> camouflage<00:02:40.360> neither

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
buy a rangefinder in camouflage neither

buy a rangefinder in camouflage neither
the<00:02:41.110> Leica<00:02:41.320> or<00:02:41.740> the<00:02:42.130> vortex<00:02:42.520> are<00:02:42.670> available<00:02:43.030> in

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
the Leica or the vortex are available in

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.910 
the Leica or the vortex are available in

that<00:02:45.160> make<00:02:45.460> them<00:02:45.670> in<00:02:45.850> AP<00:02:46.360> and<00:02:46.720> I<00:02:46.810> think<00:02:47.020> they

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
that make them in AP and I think they

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.340 
that make them in AP and I think they
make<00:02:47.290> mossy<00:02:47.800> oak<00:02:47.980> as<00:02:48.250> well<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:49.690> I<00:02:49.870> just<00:02:50.110> I

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
make mossy oak as well and I just I

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.840 
make mossy oak as well and I just I
would<00:02:50.860> never<00:02:51.070> make<00:02:51.370> something<00:02:51.730> that

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
would never make something that

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.700 
would never make something that
expensive<00:02:52.390> that<00:02:52.480> easy<00:02:52.720> to<00:02:52.960> lose<00:02:53.140> I<00:02:55.230> like<00:02:56.230> the

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
expensive that easy to lose I like the

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.190 
expensive that easy to lose I like the
flexibility<00:02:57.310> in<00:02:57.490> the<00:02:57.580> vortex<00:02:57.760> unit<00:02:58.270> I<00:02:58.450> like

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
flexibility in the vortex unit I like

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.830 
flexibility in the vortex unit I like
that<00:02:59.560> I<00:02:59.770> can<00:03:00.250> set<00:03:00.460> it<00:03:00.490> to<00:03:00.700> meters<00:03:00.880> or<00:03:01.180> yards<00:03:01.210> I'm

trying to shoot all metric now it can

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.900 
trying to shoot all metric now it can
either<00:03:04.270> compensate<00:03:04.960> for<00:03:05.260> me<00:03:05.470> or<00:03:05.620> I<00:03:05.680> can<00:03:06.580> tell

either compensate for me or I can tell
