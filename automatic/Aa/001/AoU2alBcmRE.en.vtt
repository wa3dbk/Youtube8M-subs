00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.650
 hello to all and welcome to those who 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.460
 join us on my channel 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.839
 today I showed you a little 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.120
 little how clay filter and 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.190
 order purifies last week we 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.700
 was able to find in the wild 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.710
 so we'll take it and the filter and 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.500
 for that I'm going to need a 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.930
 sieve according to the quantities you 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.130
 will you choose a sieve more or 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.109
 less here candidates are friends of 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.429
 masonry so it's very easy to 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.849
 find you have a fortnight 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.340
 euros 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.890
 zurich ots and you buy a trash 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.500
 at the same time and then how's that 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.399
 works 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.590
 I have the back of a lot of water so meta 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.430
 put another container 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:50.070
 I'm going to put so matter so that 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.070
 I found that it is best crushed 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.239
 its good 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.579
 so she remains gross of any 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.670
 way she'll be liquefied a little 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:04.379
 little so you take that land you 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.939
 place it then you have to pour 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.430
 water up to the water's edge until submerged 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.430
 all of the clay and 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.799
 imperfections we will then do the sorting 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.189
 a little bit manually if a pebble 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.810
 we will take him directly and after 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.390
 will help you with a utensil you can 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.700
 help you with a whip or a 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:30.479
 wooden spatula to evacuate a small 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:32.220
 little bit wide and if you're not 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.920
 hurry that you have patience you 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.150
 can just use a sieve 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.570
 in which you have it you go 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:44.030
 put your clay submerged the whole 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:46.920
 So in a container and left actually 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.079
 the nature to be made and the clay itself 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.950
 deposited naturally at the bottom of the tray 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:55.320
 with water it will still be necessary 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.540
 mix once in a while once a 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.950
 day but that you can do it on 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.680
 several weeks does not tell you about 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.940
 large quantities it can be useful 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.980
 we'll be good 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:10.460
 at the bottom of the sieve it will stay that the 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:12.990
 callas so we come to term the mixture 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.270
 the clay is deposited at the bottom of the bucket 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.800
 to recover it we can empty and 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.810
 the excess water or wait 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.810
 that it evaporates and recover the dough 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.120
 if you have large amounts of 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.400
 lands to process and filter use 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.260
 bigger sieves go see at 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.880
 radius masonry from your supermarket or 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.340
 from your collage shop you 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.010
 find your happiness and stamens 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.750
 masonry that are perfect for that 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.170
 also use instead of a jump a 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.110
 trash can 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.020
 you will see you will be treated fairly 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.920
 easily large amounts of land 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.540
 I hope you enjoy
