vestige<00:02:54.350> I<00:02:54.620> do<00:02:54.800> think<00:02:55.070> it's<00:02:55.190> safe<00:02:55.310> to<00:02:55.340> say<00:02:55.490> that

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
vestige I do think it's safe to say that

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.830 
vestige I do think it's safe to say that
Jaden<00:02:56.000> got<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.210> better<00:02:56.360> hand<00:02:56.600> of<00:02:56.720> these

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
Jaden got the better hand of these

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.570 
Jaden got the better hand of these
exchanges<00:02:57.350> card<00:02:57.620> losing<00:02:58.070> the<00:02:58.160> mining<00:02:58.430> time

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
exchanges card losing the mining time

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.430 
exchanges card losing the mining time
then<00:02:58.760> also<00:02:59.030> losing<00:02:59.480> to<00:02:59.660> drones<00:02:59.960> he<00:03:00.170> is<00:03:00.290> gonna

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
then also losing to drones he is gonna

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.290 
then also losing to drones he is gonna
drop<00:03:00.710> the<00:03:00.830> quick<00:03:01.040> a<00:03:01.070> hatchery<00:03:01.400> as<00:03:01.790> well<00:03:02.030> I

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
drop the quick a hatchery as well I

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.120 
drop the quick a hatchery as well I
think<00:03:02.630> that<00:03:02.870> Jaedong<00:03:03.140> is<00:03:03.260> gonna<00:03:03.560> go<00:03:03.680> all<00:03:03.860> a<00:03:03.890> lot

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
think that Jaedong is gonna go all a lot

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.490 
think that Jaedong is gonna go all a lot

those<00:04:27.650> are<00:04:27.680> things<00:04:28.070> were<00:04:28.190> able<00:04:28.310> to<00:04:28.430> surprise

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
those are things were able to surprise

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.400 
those are things were able to surprise
what<00:04:29.419> this<00:04:29.570> overload<00:04:29.900> should<00:04:30.080> be<00:04:30.199> able<00:04:30.320> to

what this overload should be able to

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.920 
what this overload should be able to
spot<00:04:30.650> most<00:04:30.860> of<00:04:30.979> these<00:04:31.039> links<00:04:31.370> yep<00:04:32.030> so<00:04:32.750> you

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
spot most of these links yep so you

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.330 
spot most of these links yep so you

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949 
gonna run into the main bay right up

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.529 
gonna run into the main bay right up
into<00:04:43.160> the<00:04:43.250> main<00:04:43.430> base<00:04:43.669> so<00:04:43.880> he's<00:04:44.000> got<00:04:44.150> servings

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:44.539

in the main Scarlett can't really fight

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:47.529 
in the main Scarlett can't really fight
against<00:04:46.639> em<00:04:46.729> she's<00:04:46.910> gonna<00:04:47.000> lose<00:04:47.180> even<00:04:47.389> more

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:47.539

drones<00:04:48.080> right<00:04:48.320> now<00:04:48.530> meats<00:04:49.009> it<00:04:49.160> might<00:04:49.340> go<00:04:49.490> very

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:49.789 
drones right now meats it might go very

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:52.300 
drones right now meats it might go very
well<00:04:49.849> as<00:04:50.060> she<00:04:50.150> does<00:04:50.360> micro<00:04:50.840> very<00:04:51.080> well<00:04:51.320> and<00:04:51.560> now

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
well as she does micro very well and now

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.010 
well as she does micro very well and now
her<00:04:52.520> own<00:04:52.699> certainly<00:04:53.090> speed<00:04:53.330> should<00:04:53.570> finish<00:04:53.750> up

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
her own certainly speed should finish up

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.990 
her own certainly speed should finish up
and<00:04:54.229> with<00:04:54.349> that<00:04:54.620> she<00:04:55.009> will<00:04:55.250> be<00:04:55.400> able<00:04:55.580> to<00:04:55.789> hold

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
and with that she will be able to hold

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.390 
and with that she will be able to hold
so<00:04:56.240> surprisingly

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.560 

surprisingly<00:05:02.400> scarlet<00:05:03.000> gets<00:05:03.180> through<00:05:03.390> that

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
surprisingly scarlet gets through that
