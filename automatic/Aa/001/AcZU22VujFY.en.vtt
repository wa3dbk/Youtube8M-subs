00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.709
 how are we again on the stand of SSL 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:17.649
 and it's not just the expander new but up 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.589
 it is just winter flag in the 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:23.849
 Soil on the native platforms imported into the calculator 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:25.419
 and Klaus will be the same 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:28.130
 some on the clock 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.419
 and we'll also see some screenshots and I guess that will 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:33.830
 at least as exciting 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.260
 far from it console 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.450
 Merz have 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.720
 Duran Delfs broke out in 2006 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.640
 based on a celebration at Ascheberg 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.950
 Not all know that maybe but celebration has white n-standard 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.590
 to interpret differently in a great many people 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.430
 the whole windows world for example and Dreierwalde Soini you never really 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.560
 good friends 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.610
 that means there was 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.910
 You have to say a lot of problems like that 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.840
 Metropolitan Sykora 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.850
 the now but men's duo end went wonderful a Power Corp. 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.850
 but both did not work together anymore 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.640
 when it was pay 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.520
 still always have to 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.170
 that came to two weeks as the calculator 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.650
 and have no comparable performance as today 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.360
 At that time none of them 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.080
 2 4 8 gates 12 4 24 holes and talked 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.230
 Meanwhile we have the CDU with the intention of bringing the performance 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.690
 Elias projects 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.860
 ridiculous when we're using our little displays at the Online Game of Thrones 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.260
 more efficient 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.890
 And yet they make life more complicated because of him 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.750
 The whole car then he has to be shoveled more and more the track free but he 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:38.990
 he knew 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.990
 not the fastest 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.590
 We have then in the country versions from which they go 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.570
 Of course, then faster and more reliable 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.780
 but that's the way it is 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.530
 meanwhile, they seem to be with 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.500
 Centigrade decades round 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.760
 advised an audio 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.510
 around the place in the well-balanced as well as the word as well 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.780
 that too is not always ideal 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.650
 and that's why they've taken a step forward 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.710
 the ads already 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.310
 but thought 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.799
 It turned out to play in the Nati 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:09.789
 we had a 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.919
 6 19 

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:14.009
 the bill on the 2nd 

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:15.229
 in the whole 

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:18.229
 Breaking Mac or PC Them is a Floating 

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:22.009
 and that means they had to leave 

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:24.329
 9 write 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:25.549
 Application 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:27.799
 that means we have so 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.449
 the better parts of a year spent the flag is too too 

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:32.369
 optimize 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:33.609
 that is not 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:38.039
 so far at 5 3 1 starts so the LBS left knee but to go 

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:39.329
 we tried it 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:40.759
 unofficially 

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:42.929
 on the 8 mark 

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:45.179
 outside instances 

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:46.669
 "It's so disappointing 

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:50.109
 that should be for the 9th 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:53.119
 the most insane users reach 

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:54.519
 So who's testing? 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.520
 that he left the CDU no problem 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.799
 we can really do a lot of the lead roles 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.799
 and we have lie in the past now 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:05.309
 that is, once 

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:08.359
 Helgoland is endless Christian Justa 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:10.619
 it is Dr 

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:13.549
 he has Niki without compressor thus the EKD 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.209
 Protest the bus is important 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.329
 we knew it was another it is a legend 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.590
 Of course, Sarina four-thousanders consoles 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.429
 in all consoles as 

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:25.379
 Buzzer compressor traveled with the specific 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:27.729
 different signals around the EM 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:30.969
 Mixed so to speak, then attacked 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:34.120
 it comes in different forms, there are other companies that LEG them 

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:34.639
 alleviate 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:36.719
 Have a minute now 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:38.719
 this is how the organ changes 

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:40.869
 if you have the original parameters 

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:43.869
 implemented one to one 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.069
 and move the arms 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.069
 with this original little introductory round 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:52.399
 and they are already available but you can buy them 

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:53.779
 you can buy that 

00:03:53.779 --> 00:03:56.669
 The official release date was in February 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:59.469
 and in the meantime 

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:01.049
 Available in the courtyard 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.489
 there you can see the flag of the individual 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.769
 on what also the tourist chimes AXA an outstanding 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.899
 Review 

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:08.919
 Improve oryx 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:11.259
 lead to very complex processing to the end 

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:14.259
 a professional applications 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.229
 These are two tourists 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:19.819
 I can only recommend to everyone 

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:22.849
 who has worked with burn marks Bramstedt has everything you need 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:24.520
 super great gates 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.740
 how you can really clean the tracks 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.090
 Andritz put her seriously 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.789
 parallel compression 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:34.029
 the mendacious signal is maintained 

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:37.080
 but i can meddle in the good medicine old 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.080
 based on the program 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.569
 Oh press to read 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:47.569
 the 30 are about 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:50.560
 only recently 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.059
 3 400 

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:56.300
 the big fear 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.180
 up to 6 12 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.180
 2 960 euros 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:05.689
 So I was looking for a significantly cheaper option than receives the 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:07.999
 big consolidate next door 

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:10.339
 Israel will 

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:13.339
 for WiiWare choose to take in the calculator 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.129
 if you compare 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:19.039
 as delivered in each of the e-kix 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:21.770
 the account continues 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.770
 with the price you pay for it 

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:28.719
 like processing woodworking 

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:30.120
 with reference to the use 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.259
 Number less 5 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:34.469
 you can not expect that this region 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:38.049
 the highest expectations for that is all up to 7 Nicolas Massu's thirst 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.029
 that was when he became his 

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:44.240
 athletic director 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.499
 Gudrun 4 

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:48.229
 We'll see you soon, too. Joe is back
