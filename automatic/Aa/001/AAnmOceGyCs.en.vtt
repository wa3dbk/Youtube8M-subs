00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
anything at all and I think this is a

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.320 
anything at all and I think this is a
big<00:00:38.710> mistake<00:00:38.830> small<00:00:39.730> groups<00:00:39.910> should<00:00:40.120> have<00:00:40.300> a

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.330 
big mistake small groups should have a

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.510 
big mistake small groups should have a
place<00:00:40.600> for<00:00:40.630> spiritual<00:00:41.320> feeding<00:00:41.500> and<00:00:41.770> yes<00:00:42.220> yes

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
place for spiritual feeding and yes yes

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.760 
place for spiritual feeding and yes yes
we<00:00:42.910> are<00:00:43.000> transformed<00:00:43.690> some<00:00:43.990> by<00:00:44.200> mission<00:00:44.560> and

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 
we are transformed some by mission and

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.880 
we are transformed some by mission and
yes<00:00:45.010> we<00:00:45.430> are<00:00:45.580> transformed<00:00:46.240> by<00:00:46.630> community<00:00:47.200> but

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
yes we are transformed by community but

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.500 
yes we are transformed by community but
if<00:00:48.040> we<00:00:48.220> don't<00:00:48.460> set<00:00:48.790> aside<00:00:49.030> some<00:00:49.060> time<00:00:49.270> for

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
if we don't set aside some time for

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.290 
if we don't set aside some time for
intentionally<00:00:50.470> feeding<00:00:50.890> ourselves<00:00:51.300> we're

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
intentionally feeding ourselves we're

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.850 
intentionally feeding ourselves we're
not<00:00:52.510> being<00:00:52.750> transformed<00:00:53.200> on<00:00:53.380> the<00:00:53.470> inside

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
not being transformed on the inside

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.830 
not being transformed on the inside
we're<00:00:54.400> going<00:00:54.550> to<00:00:54.610> run<00:00:54.760> short<00:00:55.150> of<00:00:55.270> energy<00:00:55.630> and

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
we're going to run short of energy and

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.200 
we're going to run short of energy and
vision<00:00:56.050> we're<00:00:56.560> going<00:00:56.710> to<00:00:56.770> dry<00:00:56.980> up<00:00:57.030> so<00:00:58.030> it's

vision we're going to dry up so it's

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.450 
vision we're going to dry up so it's

the inductive bible study method you can

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.400 
the inductive bible study method you can
learn<00:03:42.820> how<00:03:43.030> to<00:03:43.090> lead<00:03:43.360> people<00:03:43.540> into<00:03:43.810> great

should<00:03:49.780> know<00:03:49.959> it<00:03:50.250> inductive<00:03:51.250> bible<00:03:51.400> study<00:03:51.730> is

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
should know it inductive bible study is

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.180 
should know it inductive bible study is
basically<00:03:52.750> letting<00:03:53.050> the<00:03:53.290> Bible<00:03:53.709> speak

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
basically letting the Bible speak

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.699 
basically letting the Bible speak
directly<00:03:54.580> to<00:03:54.670> us<00:03:54.820> it<00:03:55.420> assumes<00:03:56.170> that<00:03:56.350> the<00:03:56.500> Word

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
directly to us it assumes that the Word

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.430 
directly to us it assumes that the Word
of<00:03:56.800> God<00:03:56.860> has<00:03:57.280> something<00:03:57.610> to<00:03:57.730> say<00:03:58.019> so<00:03:59.019> we<00:03:59.230> allow

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
of God has something to say so we allow

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.410 
of God has something to say so we allow
the<00:03:59.500> text<00:04:00.040> to<00:04:00.160> build<00:04:00.370> its<00:04:00.519> own<00:04:00.700> conclusions

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
the text to build its own conclusions

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.180 
the text to build its own conclusions
and<00:04:01.630> then<00:04:01.900> we<00:04:01.989> take<00:04:02.230> those<00:04:02.380> conclusions<00:04:02.739> and

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
and then we take those conclusions and

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.400 
and then we take those conclusions and
apply<00:04:03.519> them<00:04:03.730> to<00:04:03.790> our<00:04:03.910> lives<00:04:04.239> now<00:04:05.230> there's

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
apply them to our lives now there's

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.259 
apply them to our lives now there's
three<00:04:05.470> basic<00:04:05.800> steps<00:04:06.100> to<00:04:06.700> the<00:04:06.790> inductive<00:04:07.150> bible

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
three basic steps to the inductive bible

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.020 
three basic steps to the inductive bible
study<00:04:07.540> method<00:04:07.840> the<00:04:08.260> first<00:04:08.500> step<00:04:08.680> is

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
study method the first step is

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.840 
study method the first step is
observation<00:04:10.030> what<00:04:10.870> is<00:04:11.019> the<00:04:11.110> text<00:04:11.470> say<00:04:11.799> and<00:04:12.070> the

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
observation what is the text say and the

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.880 
observation what is the text say and the
second<00:04:13.209> step<00:04:13.360> is<00:04:13.570> interpretation<00:04:14.350> what<00:04:14.769> does

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
second step is interpretation what does

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.680 
second step is interpretation what does
it<00:04:14.980> mean<00:04:15.190> and<00:04:15.430> the<00:04:15.970> third<00:04:16.180> step<00:04:16.479> is

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
it mean and the third step is

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.409 
it mean and the third step is
application<00:04:17.609> applying<00:04:18.609> that<00:04:18.850> meaning<00:04:19.239> to<00:04:19.390> our

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
application applying that meaning to our

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.750 
application applying that meaning to our
life<00:04:19.690> today<00:04:19.930> now<00:04:20.830> that<00:04:21.010> sounds<00:04:21.160> pretty<00:04:21.370> simple

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
life today now that sounds pretty simple

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.159 
life today now that sounds pretty simple
but<00:04:21.790> it<00:04:21.970> takes<00:04:22.120> a<00:04:22.270> little<00:04:22.390> practice<00:04:22.630> to<00:04:23.050> get

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
but it takes a little practice to get

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:25.290 
but it takes a little practice to get
the<00:04:23.260> hang<00:04:23.380> of<00:04:23.500> it<00:04:23.590> but<00:04:24.520> this<00:04:24.640> method<00:04:24.850> gives<00:04:25.090> us

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
the hang of it but this method gives us

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.900 
the hang of it but this method gives us
exactly<00:04:25.450> what<00:04:26.020> we<00:04:26.050> want

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
exactly what we want

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.610 
exactly what we want
we<00:04:27.180> want<00:04:27.510> to<00:04:27.630> take<00:04:27.750> the<00:04:27.870> Bible<00:04:28.200> and<00:04:28.350> make<00:04:28.500> it

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
we want to take the Bible and make it

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.710 
we want to take the Bible and make it
applicable<00:04:28.920> to<00:04:29.190> our<00:04:29.220> lives<00:04:29.520> we<00:04:30.120> want<00:04:30.450> to<00:04:30.630> be

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
applicable to our lives we want to be

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.720 
applicable to our lives we want to be
changed<00:04:31.110> and<00:04:31.290> transformed<00:04:31.530> by<00:04:32.010> it<00:04:32.070> and<00:04:32.340> the

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
changed and transformed by it and the

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.820 
changed and transformed by it and the
best<00:04:32.940> way<00:04:33.120> to<00:04:33.240> do<00:04:33.420> this<00:04:33.570> is<00:04:33.750> to<00:04:34.440> do<00:04:34.560> a<00:04:34.590> bible

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
best way to do this is to do a bible

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.610 
best way to do this is to do a bible
study<00:04:35.010> in<00:04:35.460> a<00:04:35.550> group<00:04:35.760> setting<00:04:36.000> I<00:04:36.360> can<00:04:37.050> only<00:04:37.260> see

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
study in a group setting I can only see

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.380 
study in a group setting I can only see
through<00:04:37.980> these<00:04:38.190> two<00:04:38.460> eyes<00:04:38.610> and<00:04:38.850> my<00:04:38.940> brain<00:04:39.210> is

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
through these two eyes and my brain is

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.140 
through these two eyes and my brain is
set<00:04:39.600> up<00:04:39.720> in<00:04:39.900> only<00:04:40.290> one<00:04:40.560> way<00:04:40.800> and<00:04:41.100> this<00:04:41.670> limits

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
set up in only one way and this limits

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.780 
set up in only one way and this limits
how<00:04:42.360> I<00:04:42.390> can<00:04:42.690> do<00:04:42.840> observation<00:04:43.470> for<00:04:44.280> instance<00:04:44.550> I

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
how I can do observation for instance I

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.820 
how I can do observation for instance I
can<00:04:45.000> be<00:04:45.330> analytical<00:04:45.930> and<00:04:46.110> I<00:04:46.350> can<00:04:46.560> see<00:04:46.710> the

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
can be analytical and I can see the

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.250 
can be analytical and I can see the
structure<00:04:47.190> of<00:04:47.340> a<00:04:47.490> text<00:04:47.850> pretty<00:04:48.090> quickly<00:04:48.360> but<00:04:49.200> I

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
structure of a text pretty quickly but I

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.560 
structure of a text pretty quickly but I
don't<00:04:49.470> see<00:04:49.680> emotions<00:04:50.130> very<00:04:50.280> well<00:04:50.400> but<00:04:51.300> some

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
don't see emotions very well but some

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.330 
don't see emotions very well but some
other<00:04:51.750> people<00:04:52.050> do<00:04:52.200> so<00:04:52.740> when<00:04:52.890> I'm<00:04:52.980> in<00:04:53.100> a<00:04:53.160> group

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
other people do so when I'm in a group

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.250 
other people do so when I'm in a group
setting<00:04:53.550> and<00:04:53.820> I<00:04:53.850> do<00:04:53.910> observations<00:04:54.260> they

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
setting and I do observations they

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.780 
setting and I do observations they
helped<00:04:55.560> me<00:04:55.710> see<00:04:55.950> things<00:04:56.160> that<00:04:56.370> I<00:04:56.400> would<00:04:56.610> miss

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
helped me see things that I would miss
