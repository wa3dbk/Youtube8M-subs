00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.920
 [Music] 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.929

 that this hype around gta 5 is there 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.779

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.550

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.230
 been murdered because the game is 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.730

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.079
 the game and then come a few 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:43.640
 plug holstein over his head 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:46.140
 I did not want to write why 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.610
 and the worst thing is the media now 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.739
 Of course, without a the 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.199

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.670

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.180
 offender caught but still would 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.590

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.230
 home game of the millions of dollars 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.670
 costs for production technology that you 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.989
 my taste a bit too extreme 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.820
 Of course, we're telling you that 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.770
 responsible for that the media then 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.299
 Always we pick on the mood 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.460
 gamers oh no 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.810
 the gamer is getting more and more aggressive 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.880
 me to the story of final fantasy 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.710
 7 Two guys have the bad guy 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.520

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.880
 Once I was in Florida 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.880
 the people there are actually like that 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.189
 like I went to a taxi driver 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:41.939

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:43.500
