00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 in the hectic of the New Year holidays somehow not 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.830
 a very event was noticed which in 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.380
 other days would be a global sensation 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.420
 according to information from open sources 30 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.210
 December, the first nuclear submarine 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.490
 new class and ash transferred 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.580
 Russian Navy for 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.880
 experience in technical maintenance of ash 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.609
 something in the west has already been baptized 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.580
 and the best from hurts a deep monster 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.250
 deepest monster at least so 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.489
 writes about ash ash british sandy times 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.280
 partly here and the desire to scare Russia 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.800
 which is quite in the English tradition but all 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.469
 same and characteristics of our new boat 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.420
 such that ignore its presence in 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.239
 ocean depths will be impossible 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.059
 inform that the metal hull of the boat 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.670
 covered with special synthetics that 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.370
 It makes it less noisy and faster 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.820
 almost imperceptible to underwater 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.879
 the radar itself is clear to its hydroacoustics 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.489
 able to see even in multimeter 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.330
 thicker than arctic ice slush 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:12.869
 some kind of half frozen kashina salty water 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.240
 if generally the British believe that with 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.729
 ash Russia resolutely breaks out 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.250
 forward in underwater technology for 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.950
 the accuracy of the flag of St. Andrew over the first 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.009
 Ash is not yet, but we are looking forward to it 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.030
 a tie when ash is adopted 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.159
 into service 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.229
 but without him our submarine fleet 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.500
 guarantees Russia the possibility of peaceful 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.680
 development and how are we here in the civilian world 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.049
 these opportunities we use depends 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.600
 not from naval officers but that doesn't mean 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.320
 that the officer our achievement is not 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.950
 are interesting 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.890
 and those who are in the thickness of the Arctic waters 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.290
 Russia and those who build the best in the world 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.970
 submarine from Severodvinsk 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.310

 future submarine 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.090
 ships of this type will form the basis 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.310
 underwater strategic forces of Russia they 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.370
 will be able to carry combat duty in any 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.530
 the point of the world ocean commander of the newest 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.450
 strategic cruiser shows then 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.400
 not much to see 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.160
 to journalists though on this submarine 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.420
 secret almost all foreign military 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.550
 analysts are recognized 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.860
 about modern russian boats they don't 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.050
 have half the required information 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.959
 Meanwhile, the crew of Vladimir Monomakh 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.000
 the boat is now up to being equipped in plo in the dock 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.330
 famous Sevmash on the white beach 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.540

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.769
 this ship is an integral part 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.290
 nuclear missile shield and with the replenishment 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.239
 other ships that will be coming 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.940
 and this project more 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.150
 improved ships we are always 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.080
 we will know that the points strengthened us 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.510
 strengthened strengthened and will 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.940
 strengthen the future project borey

 fleet last year just the same 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.370
 missile carriers will be 8 and this is at least
