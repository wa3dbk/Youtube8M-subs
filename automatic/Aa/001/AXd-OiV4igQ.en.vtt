00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 and then moÃ§ada okay to let another in 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.560
 computer science in the kitchen 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.400
 this time with a very simple recipe 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:15.240
 very quickie that's what I learned already makes a 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.550
 time I never did call ice cream 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.109
 the real mass ice cream is a 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:25.019
 simulation of a mass of a just is just 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.000
 made of ice cream for people like 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.369
 I like that this dessert is very 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.439
 legal mainly now at this time 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.390
 of heat but before I start this 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.960
 Let me explain to you, speaking of 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.570
 that there are some smaller ones that 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.780
 are called mass memory or hd 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.620
 sometimes in proof they refer to him as 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:50.010
 ht hard disk mass storage 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.739
 sometimes up to 20 bosses have hard drive 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.559
 Look at the different name for yourself. 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.390
 character is and is a mass memory 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.770
 because it can store 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.730
 a very large amount of 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.760
 information 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.060
 there are computers that do not need the 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.090
 hp are there made computers or other 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.820
 simple draw are these computers 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.360
 which are used in call centers 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.729
 would normally be very expensive to have 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.799
 several computers as a 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:28.080
 work for each employee 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:31.650
 I have a box like a box like 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:36.780
 which is used to reduce costs 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:39.030
 and this maybe customer does not have to 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.329
 does not have this mass memory 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.479
 it has to use the hd of a server ok 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.229
 It is good to take now to understand how 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.500
 does 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.899
 the real ice cream is good 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:57.060
 a look there very well what we are going 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:59.000
 need a container with one hand 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.799
 so I can get the ice cream 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.310
 I'll need something too. 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:09.509
 serve as a sauce for the ice cream 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:13.980
 is something that will serve as a kid for the 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:17.160
 grated coconut cream crutcher 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.489
 potatoes that I improvised here by pulling 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.959
 these holes that have here on the side to 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:26.280
 stay with the holes here 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:29.430
 background and a final dock that is a 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.819
 mint sprig and we'll need 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.110
 also an ice cream is spending a 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.160
 money here to buy 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.980
 this ice cream that you know the brand alone 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.190
 that I can not keep spreading is 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.410
 here 's a nice ice cream very well 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.190
 very simple and nothing should go wrong 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.709
 this time 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.190
 just take the ice cream is that the 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:57.390
 ice cream with little way puts in 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.110
 potato squeezer put one more 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.230
 ball 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:07.769
 I believe it should be enough 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:10.769
 so two good here is now the following 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:14.459
 I will prepare here to squeeze as if 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:20.390
 I had squeezed potatoes and the 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:20.390
 result will be this 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.190
 I just broke the squeezer 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.240
 potatoes 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.770
 It's amazing they can go wrong they can always 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:49.180
 go wrong 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:51.130
 Okay and now get the sauce means 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.490
 in fact it will replace the sauce 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:58.000
 for the arianos dessert like this 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:03.940
 here is very good here 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:06.880
 the final touch see that you also put a 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:10.630
 little coconut grated to 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:15.790
 representing the cheese has already made everything out of 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:21.010
 order places leaflets here and there as 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:25.420
 got our dough ice cream 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:28.150
 this is the real ice cream of mass and 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:36.000
 Did you see that nothing went wrong? 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:36.000
 It's a delight to try it out that got good 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.500
 simply wonderful is not in my 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.700
 name is the end we'll see each other 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.360
 in the other video 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.360
 a hug
