the air flying and look at this this is
a<00:00:22.320> metal<00:00:22.800> piece<00:00:23.070> this<00:00:23.369> purple<00:00:23.820> see<00:00:24.300> this

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
a metal piece this purple see this

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.380 
a metal piece this purple see this
purple<00:00:24.890> all<00:00:25.890> right<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.430> used<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.820> be<00:00:26.970> connected

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
purple all right it used to be connected

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.050 
purple all right it used to be connected
all<00:00:28.230> right<00:00:28.380> while<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:28.980> was<00:00:29.310> flying<00:00:29.609> in<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.939> air

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
all right while I was flying in the air

all right while I was flying in the air
the<00:00:30.869> metal<00:00:31.289> broken<00:00:32.070> too<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.489> didn't<00:00:33.059> hit

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
the metal broken too I didn't hit

the metal broken too I didn't hit
anything<00:00:33.390> didn't<00:00:34.320> do<00:00:34.440> anything<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.980> wasn't

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.830 
even doing tricks or anything just
normal<00:00:37.829> straight<00:00:38.219> flying<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:39.540> look<00:00:39.660> at<00:00:39.750> this

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
normal straight flying and look at this

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.110 
normal straight flying and look at this
the<00:00:40.800> metal<00:00:41.190> piece<00:00:41.989> broke<00:00:43.010> into<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.760> heat<00:00:44.940> sink

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
the metal piece broke into the heat sink

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.170 
the metal piece broke into the heat sink
for<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.390> motor<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.890> holds<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:46.950> in<00:00:47.100> place<00:00:47.180> so

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
for the motor that holds it in place so

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.020 
for the motor that holds it in place so
when<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.660> broke<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.710> looks<00:00:49.920> like<00:00:50.100> my<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.730> course

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
when a broke it looks like my of course

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.549 
when a broke it looks like my of course
my<00:00:51.239> propeller<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:53.210> knows<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.289> spinner<00:00:55.289> came

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
my propeller and knows a spinner came

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.930 
my propeller and knows a spinner came
off<00:00:55.680> now<00:00:55.860> I'm<00:00:55.920> not<00:00:56.070> sure<00:00:56.309> how<00:00:56.460> my<00:00:56.579> propeller

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
off now I'm not sure how my propeller

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.580 
off now I'm not sure how my propeller
came<00:00:57.239> off<00:00:57.390> like<00:00:57.539> everything<00:00:58.050> pulled<00:00:58.379> off<00:00:58.559> of

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
came off like everything pulled off of

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.160 
came off like everything pulled off of
the<00:00:58.800> screw<00:00:59.100> some<00:00:59.309> how<00:00:59.430> that's<00:01:00.020> kind<00:01:01.020> of

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
the screw some how that's kind of

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.439 
the screw some how that's kind of
confusing<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.800> me<00:01:01.949> how<00:01:02.670> everything<00:01:02.969> could

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
confusing to me how everything could

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.649 
confusing to me how everything could
have<00:01:03.480> come<00:01:04.049> off<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.470> motor<00:01:05.270> but<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.540> how

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
have come off the motor but this is how

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.359 
have come off the motor but this is how
it<00:01:06.780> landed<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.260> landed<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.890> water<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.280> I

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
it landed I landed in the water and I

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.620 
it landed I landed in the water and I
was<00:01:08.490> able<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.790> get<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:08.970> back<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.240> shore<00:01:09.270> with

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
was able to get it back to shore with

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.630 
was able to get it back to shore with
one<00:01:09.780> motor<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.320> this<00:01:11.040> motor<00:01:11.250> was<00:01:11.430> just

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
one motor and this motor was just

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.660 
one motor and this motor was just
hanging<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.180> spinning<00:01:12.770> but<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:14.040> am<00:01:14.310> kind<00:01:14.549> of

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
hanging and spinning but I am kind of

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.270 
hanging and spinning but I am kind of
confused<00:01:14.850> at<00:01:15.299> how<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.710> propeller<00:01:16.710> came<00:01:17.070> off

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
confused at how the propeller came off

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.700 
confused at how the propeller came off
but<00:01:18.060> I'm<00:01:18.180> also<00:01:18.330> confused<00:01:18.479> at<00:01:18.990> how<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.350> metal

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
but I'm also confused at how this metal

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.320 
but I'm also confused at how this metal
piece<00:01:19.860> breaks<00:01:20.100> this<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.850> motor<00:01:21.060> mount

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
piece breaks this is the motor mount

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.240 
piece breaks this is the motor mount
that<00:01:21.509> they<00:01:21.659> include<00:01:22.140> with<00:01:22.439> this<00:01:22.650> plane<00:01:22.950> and

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
that they include with this plane and

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.660 
that they include with this plane and
I've<00:01:24.090> had<00:01:24.240> probably<00:01:25.040> no<00:01:26.040> no<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.220> probably<00:01:26.460> had

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
I've had probably no no I probably had

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.719 
I've had probably no no I probably had
between<00:01:27.030> 10<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.360> 15<00:01:27.570> flights<00:01:28.049> on<00:01:28.259> this<00:01:28.729> but

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
between 10 and 15 flights on this but

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.730 
between 10 and 15 flights on this but
that<00:01:29.850> doesn't<00:01:30.150> matter<00:01:30.270> even<00:01:31.140> if<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.380> had<00:01:31.530> five

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
that doesn't matter even if I had five

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.679 
that doesn't matter even if I had five
hundred<00:01:32.100> flights<00:01:32.310> on<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:33.210> first<00:01:33.479> thing

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
hundred flights on this the first thing

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.810 
hundred flights on this the first thing
you'd<00:01:33.810> expect<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.259> die<00:01:34.439> is<00:01:34.500> maybe<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.009> ESC<00:01:35.520> or

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
you'd expect to die is maybe the ESC or

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.149 
you'd expect to die is maybe the ESC or
the<00:01:36.060> motor<00:01:36.350> you<00:01:37.350> know<00:01:37.470> maybe<00:01:37.619> your<00:01:37.829> battery

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
the motor you know maybe your battery

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.410 
the motor you know maybe your battery
would<00:01:38.250> go<00:01:38.400> bad<00:01:38.610> or<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:38.880> might<00:01:39.060> want<00:01:39.270> new

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
would go bad or you might want new

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.960 
would go bad or you might want new
servos<00:01:39.869> but<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.560> motor<00:01:40.799> mount<00:01:41.100> this<00:01:41.759> is

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
servos but the motor mount this is

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.520 
servos but the motor mount this is
supposed<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.329> be<00:01:42.420> strong<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:42.990> hold<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.320> motor

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
supposed to be strong and hold the motor

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.170 
supposed to be strong and hold the motor
in<00:01:43.770> all<00:01:44.490> right<00:01:44.700> nitro<00:01:45.479> planes<00:01:46.049> guan<00:01:46.829> lee

in all right nitro planes guan lee
equals<00:01:48.180> junk<00:01:48.960> alright<00:01:49.860> so<00:01:50.520> i'm<00:01:51.299> going<00:01:51.420> to

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
equals junk alright so i'm going to

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.710 
equals junk alright so i'm going to
rebuild<00:01:51.780> this<00:01:52.189> probably<00:01:53.189> going<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.570> this<00:01:54.570> is
