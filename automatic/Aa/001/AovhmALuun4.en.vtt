unfortunately and what a big beach area

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.560 
unfortunately and what a big beach area
at<00:00:26.210> this<00:00:26.420> side<00:00:28.090> cobbles<00:00:29.090> are<00:00:29.180> all<00:00:29.330> just

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
at this side cobbles are all just

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.920 
at this side cobbles are all just
chucked<00:00:30.170> in<00:00:30.380> and<00:00:30.970> well<00:00:31.970> migrate<00:00:32.449> towards<00:00:32.840> the

bottom<00:00:33.050> of<00:00:33.230> the<00:00:33.290> pond<00:00:33.559> so<00:00:33.739> we're<00:00:34.040> gonna<00:00:34.129> alter

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
bottom of the pond so we're gonna alter

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.119 
bottom of the pond so we're gonna alter
that<00:00:34.640> and<00:00:34.850> put<00:00:35.840> a<00:00:35.870> nice<00:00:36.110> big<00:00:36.350> shelf<00:00:36.650> on<00:00:36.830> here<00:00:37.010> to

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
that and put a nice big shelf on here to

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:40.530 
that and put a nice big shelf on here to
retain<00:00:37.460> them<00:00:38.530> take<00:00:39.530> everything<00:00:39.890> out

retain them take everything out

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.789 
retain them take everything out
basically<00:00:41.540> just<00:00:41.920> strip<00:00:42.920> it<00:00:43.040> down<00:00:43.070> and<00:00:43.540> then

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:44.799 
basically just strip it down and then

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
side we've kept them fairly local just

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.229 
side we've kept them fairly local just
tip<00:01:00.320> them<00:01:00.440> over<00:01:00.559> the<00:01:00.739> back<00:01:00.920> there<00:01:01.159> to<00:01:01.909> allow<00:01:02.089> us

tip them over the back there to allow us

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.689 
tip them over the back there to allow us
to<00:01:02.360> reshape<00:01:02.689> the<00:01:02.900> top<00:01:03.110> shelf<00:01:03.549> we've<00:01:04.549> whipped

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
to reshape the top shelf we've whipped

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.399 
to reshape the top shelf we've whipped
the<00:01:04.850> liner<00:01:05.030> out<00:01:05.150> there<00:01:05.689> was<00:01:05.810> a<00:01:05.840> little<00:01:06.140> bit<00:01:06.320> of

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
the liner out there was a little bit of

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.280 
the liner out there was a little bit of
underlay<00:01:06.740> in<00:01:06.979> carpet<00:01:07.729> underlay<00:01:08.290> probably

underlay in carpet underlay probably
covering<00:01:09.560> about<00:01:09.800> 20<00:01:10.130> percent<00:01:10.430> of<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:10.640> pond<00:01:11.410> so

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
covering about 20 percent of the pond so

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.050 
covering about 20 percent of the pond so
stair<00:01:12.740> is<00:01:12.890> a<00:01:12.920> token<00:01:13.160> gesture<00:01:13.550> no<00:01:14.030> more<00:01:16.060> we've

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
stair is a token gesture no more we've

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.440 
stair is a token gesture no more we've
dragged<00:01:17.690> the<00:01:18.220> cobbles<00:01:19.220> back<00:01:19.400> a<00:01:19.430> little<00:01:19.670> bit

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.670 

that'll<00:01:23.450> allow<00:01:23.600> us<00:01:23.750> to<00:01:23.900> build<00:01:24.020> a<00:01:24.170> proper<00:01:24.440> shelf

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
that'll allow us to build a proper shelf

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.710 
that'll allow us to build a proper shelf
here<00:01:24.890> to<00:01:25.070> retain<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:25.520> cobbles<00:01:25.850> and<00:01:26.030> then<00:01:26.540> just

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
here to retain the cobbles and then just

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.150 
here to retain the cobbles and then just
push<00:01:26.930> them<00:01:27.110> back<00:01:27.290> in<00:01:27.470> so<00:01:27.680> they<00:01:27.830> don't<00:01:28.010> need<00:01:28.100> to

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
push them back in so they don't need to

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.150 
push them back in so they don't need to
be<00:01:28.280> moved<00:01:28.490> twice<00:01:29.140> same<00:01:30.140> with<00:01:30.290> the<00:01:30.350> stones<00:01:30.590> once

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:31.160 
be moved twice same with the stones once

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.460 
be moved twice same with the stones once
we<00:01:31.310> get<00:01:31.430> the<00:01:31.720> shelves<00:01:32.720> done<00:01:32.870> around<00:01:33.050> the<00:01:33.230> sides

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
we get the shelves done around the sides

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.110 
we get the shelves done around the sides
we'll<00:01:34.159> just<00:01:34.370> be<00:01:34.430> able<00:01:34.490> to<00:01:34.580> lift<00:01:34.760> the<00:01:34.880> stones

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 
we'll just be able to lift the stones

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.360 
we'll just be able to lift the stones
back<00:01:35.390> into<00:01:35.630> position<00:01:35.750> and<00:01:36.200> cement<00:01:36.620> them<00:01:36.770> in

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
back into position and cement them in

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.880 
back into position and cement them in
right<00:01:40.370> this<00:01:40.520> morning<00:01:41.230> we've<00:01:42.230> reshaped<00:01:42.710> the

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
right this morning we've reshaped the

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.730 
right this morning we've reshaped the
pond<00:01:43.659> we've<00:01:44.659> dug<00:01:44.870> the<00:01:44.960> shelves<00:01:45.320> a<00:01:45.409> little<00:01:45.650> bit

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
pond we've dug the shelves a little bit

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.990 
pond we've dug the shelves a little bit
deeper<00:01:45.890> all<00:01:46.159> the<00:01:46.460> way<00:01:46.550> around<00:01:46.790> the<00:01:46.880> edges

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
deeper all the way around the edges

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.710 
deeper all the way around the edges
we've<00:01:47.540> created<00:01:47.750> a<00:01:47.960> new<00:01:48.140> shelf<00:01:48.409> around<00:01:48.770> here

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
we've created a new shelf around here

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.080 
we've created a new shelf around here
the<00:01:50.720> idea<00:01:51.080> being<00:01:51.320> to<00:01:51.590> put<00:01:52.550> a<00:01:52.580> little<00:01:52.850> bit<00:01:52.970> of

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
the idea being to put a little bit of

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.370 
the idea being to put a little bit of
cement<00:01:53.240> all<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.690> way<00:01:53.780> along<00:01:53.960> here

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
cement all the way along here

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.430 
cement all the way along here
cement<00:01:54.920> in<00:01:55.180> some<00:01:56.180> of<00:01:56.270> these<00:01:56.330> fellas<00:01:56.750> and<00:01:56.960> then

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
cement in some of these fellas and then

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.890 
cement in some of these fellas and then
pile<00:01:57.680> the<00:01:57.860> rest<00:01:58.070> behind<00:01:58.760> it<00:01:59.120> to<00:01:59.510> prevent<00:01:59.810> them

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
pile the rest behind it to prevent them

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.020 
pile the rest behind it to prevent them
falling<00:02:00.170> in

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.530 

we<00:02:04.720> had<00:02:04.810> this<00:02:04.900> inner<00:02:05.110> shelf<00:02:05.410> round<00:02:05.680> here<00:02:05.950> a

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
we had this inner shelf round here a

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.560 
we had this inner shelf round here a
little<00:02:07.540> bit<00:02:07.660> taller<00:02:08.130> ie<00:02:09.130> a<00:02:09.399> little<00:02:09.820> bit<00:02:09.940> near

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
little bit taller ie a little bit near

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.690 
little bit taller ie a little bit near
the<00:02:10.780> surface<00:02:11.250> because<00:02:12.250> there<00:02:12.370> wasn't<00:02:12.490> much

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
the surface because there wasn't much

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.520 
the surface because there wasn't much
space<00:02:12.730> for<00:02:13.240> putting<00:02:13.360> marginal<00:02:14.080> plants<00:02:14.380> before

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
space for putting marginal plants before

space for putting marginal plants before
a<00:02:15.270> shelf<00:02:16.270> was<00:02:16.420> pretty<00:02:16.630> deep<00:02:16.840> it<00:02:16.990> was<00:02:17.050> about<00:02:17.200> 18

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
a shelf was pretty deep it was about 18

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.970 
a shelf was pretty deep it was about 18
inches<00:02:17.680> he's<00:02:18.250> just<00:02:18.460> no<00:02:18.940> good<00:02:18.970> for<00:02:19.270> most<00:02:19.480> plants

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
inches he's just no good for most plants

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.020 
inches he's just no good for most plants
we've<00:02:20.980> made<00:02:21.160> another<00:02:21.370> little<00:02:21.640> shelf<00:02:21.850> in<00:02:22.000> the

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
we've made another little shelf in the

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.350 
we've made another little shelf in the
bottom<00:02:22.330> here<00:02:23.880> which<00:02:24.880> basically<00:02:25.210> just

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
bottom here which basically just

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.320 
bottom here which basically just
flattened<00:02:25.870> everything<00:02:25.990> out<00:02:27.090> ready<00:02:28.090> for<00:02:28.270> the

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
flattened everything out ready for the

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.400 
flattened everything out ready for the
underlay<00:02:31.770> that's<00:02:32.770> the<00:02:32.950> under<00:02:33.160> layer<00:02:33.310> in<00:02:33.550> now

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
underlay that's the under layer in now

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.860 
underlay that's the under layer in now
more<00:02:35.410> or<00:02:35.500> less<00:02:35.590> went<00:02:35.800> in<00:02:35.890> into<00:02:36.160> long<00:02:36.370> sheets

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
more or less went in into long sheets

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.140 
more or less went in into long sheets
it's<00:02:37.870> one<00:02:38.080> sheet<00:02:38.610> that's<00:02:39.610> another<00:02:39.940> sheet

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
it's one sheet that's another sheet

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.220 
it's one sheet that's another sheet
we've<00:02:40.990> sealed<00:02:41.230> it<00:02:41.610> with<00:02:42.610> a<00:02:42.640> heat<00:02:42.790> gun

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
we've sealed it with a heat gun

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.990 
we've sealed it with a heat gun
basically<00:02:44.230> you<00:02:44.410> just<00:02:44.440> put<00:02:44.890> a<00:02:45.670> little<00:02:45.700> bit<00:02:45.940> of

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
basically you just put a little bit of

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.310 
basically you just put a little bit of
fire<00:02:46.209> between<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:46.630> two<00:02:46.780> layers<00:02:46.959> and<00:02:47.230> press

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
fire between the two layers and press

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.190 
fire between the two layers and press
them<00:02:47.500> together<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:47.890> this<00:02:48.040> stick<00:02:48.480> so<00:02:49.480> now<00:02:49.959> it's

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
them together and this stick so now it's

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.080 
them together and this stick so now it's
time<00:02:50.350> for<00:02:50.410> the<00:02:50.650> liner<00:02:53.550> that's<00:02:54.550> the<00:02:54.730> liner<00:02:54.910> in

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
time for the liner that's the liner in

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.910 
time for the liner that's the liner in
now<00:02:55.620> it's<00:02:56.620> 1<00:02:56.860> mil<00:02:57.209> rubber<00:02:58.650> Firestone<00:02:59.650> liner

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
now it's 1 mil rubber Firestone liner

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.910 
now it's 1 mil rubber Firestone liner
you<00:03:00.640> start<00:03:00.910> filling<00:03:01.180> it<00:03:01.300> up<00:03:01.420> well<00:03:02.260> probably<00:03:02.620> is

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
you start filling it up well probably is

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.530 
you start filling it up well probably is
going<00:03:03.160> to<00:03:03.250> fill<00:03:03.400> it<00:03:03.490> up<00:03:03.580> till<00:03:03.820> it's<00:03:03.940> just<00:03:04.270> over

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
going to fill it up till it's just over

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.680 
going to fill it up till it's just over
this<00:03:04.660> shelf<00:03:05.020> here<00:03:06.300> nut<00:03:07.300> should<00:03:07.480> pull<00:03:07.660> the

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
this shelf here nut should pull the

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.900 
this shelf here nut should pull the
liner<00:03:07.959> and<00:03:08.140> enough<00:03:08.470> for<00:03:08.680> us<00:03:08.739> to<00:03:08.769> work<00:03:09.100> on<00:03:09.400> this

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
liner and enough for us to work on this

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.150 
liner and enough for us to work on this
top<00:03:10.209> shelf<00:03:10.420> cement<00:03:11.290> in<00:03:11.380> the<00:03:11.500> storms<00:03:11.830> in<00:03:11.980> it's

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
top shelf cement in the storms in it's

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.060 
top shelf cement in the storms in it's
pretty<00:03:12.280> important<00:03:12.850> to<00:03:12.910> to<00:03:13.540> fill<00:03:13.750> it<00:03:13.840> up

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
pretty important to to fill it up

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.140 
pretty important to to fill it up
sufficiently<00:03:15.070> so<00:03:15.280> it<00:03:15.400> pulls<00:03:15.580> the<00:03:15.760> liner<00:03:15.940> in

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
sufficiently so it pulls the liner in

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.380 
sufficiently so it pulls the liner in
and<00:03:16.360> makes<00:03:16.510> it<00:03:16.630> tight<00:03:16.920> otherwise<00:03:17.920> if<00:03:18.190> you<00:03:18.250> just

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
and makes it tight otherwise if you just

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.240 
and makes it tight otherwise if you just
brea<00:03:19.390> on<00:03:19.600> and<00:03:19.780> put<00:03:20.350> the<00:03:20.380> edging<00:03:20.709> stones<00:03:20.830> on

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
brea on and put the edging stones on

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.190 
brea on and put the edging stones on
when<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:21.850> line<00:03:22.030> is<00:03:22.060> loose<00:03:22.390> when<00:03:22.810> you<00:03:22.840> fill<00:03:23.080> it

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
when the line is loose when you fill it

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.590 
when the line is loose when you fill it
up<00:03:23.290> it<00:03:24.040> can<00:03:24.220> pull<00:03:24.459> the<00:03:24.580> edging<00:03:24.850> stones<00:03:24.970> in<00:03:25.390> and

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
up it can pull the edging stones in and

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.910 
up it can pull the edging stones in and
make<00:03:25.720> a<00:03:25.750> real<00:03:25.959> mess

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.440 

this<00:03:31.920> is<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.129> edge<00:03:32.249> and<00:03:32.459> just<00:03:32.760> about<00:03:33.120> half

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
this is the edge and just about half

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.780 
this is the edge and just about half
done<00:03:34.010> we're<00:03:35.010> putting<00:03:35.249> a<00:03:35.280> little<00:03:35.489> ring<00:03:35.670> of

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
done we're putting a little ring of

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.479 
done we're putting a little ring of
cobbles<00:03:36.180> cemented<00:03:36.659> in<00:03:37.189> around<00:03:38.189> the<00:03:38.310> beach

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
cobbles cemented in around the beach

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.809 
cobbles cemented in around the beach
edge<00:03:38.790> here<00:03:39.530> then<00:03:40.530> we<00:03:40.680> can<00:03:40.829> cut<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.430> liner<00:03:41.609> off

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
edge here then we can cut the liner off

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.720 
edge here then we can cut the liner off
pour<00:03:42.780> the<00:03:42.900> cobbles<00:03:43.230> back<00:03:43.469> over<00:03:43.799> that<00:03:43.920> and<00:03:44.609> it

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
pour the cobbles back over that and it

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.020 
pour the cobbles back over that and it
retains<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.209> cobbles<00:03:45.599> quite<00:03:45.900> nicely<00:03:46.139> and

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
retains the cobbles quite nicely and

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.459 
retains the cobbles quite nicely and
we've<00:03:48.030> gone<00:03:48.150> round<00:03:48.329> the<00:03:48.450> sides<00:03:48.750> with<00:03:49.109> stone

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:49.469 
we've gone round the sides with stone

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:52.129 
we've gone round the sides with stone
well<00:03:50.430> gone<00:03:51.150> halfway<00:03:51.359> around<00:03:51.569> the<00:03:51.719> side<00:03:51.959> with

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
well gone halfway around the side with

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.830 
well gone halfway around the side with
stone<00:03:53.060> obviously<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.150> waters<00:03:54.450> still<00:03:54.689> got

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
stone obviously the waters still got

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.440 
stone obviously the waters still got
quite<00:03:55.049> a<00:03:55.079> long<00:03:55.290> way<00:03:55.469> to<00:03:55.620> come<00:03:55.829> up<00:03:56.299> but<00:03:57.299> we're

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
quite a long way to come up but we're

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.970 
quite a long way to come up but we're
going<00:03:57.569> to<00:03:57.629> stop<00:03:57.900> it<00:03:58.049> just<00:03:58.349> shy<00:03:58.620> of<00:03:58.650> those

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
going to stop it just shy of those

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.429 
going to stop it just shy of those
stones<00:03:59.370> there<00:03:59.870> just<00:04:00.870> in<00:04:01.019> case<00:04:01.049> we<00:04:01.290> get<00:04:01.379> any

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439 
stones there just in case we get any

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:03.770 
stones there just in case we get any
rain<00:04:01.680> overnight<00:04:02.150> we<00:04:03.150> do<00:04:03.269> want<00:04:03.450> it<00:04:03.540> to<00:04:03.659> affect

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
rain overnight we do want it to affect

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.330 
rain overnight we do want it to affect
the<00:04:04.109> cement<00:04:04.379> that<00:04:04.530> we<00:04:04.620> put<00:04:04.799> on<00:04:06.950> all<00:04:07.950> these<00:04:08.129> gaps

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
the cement that we put on all these gaps

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.099 
the cement that we put on all these gaps
will<00:04:08.549> be<00:04:08.609> filled<00:04:08.879> in<00:04:09.120> with<00:04:09.329> soil<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:10.019> then

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
will be filled in with soil and then

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:15.229 
will be filled in with soil and then
we'll<00:04:11.099> cut<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.340> liner<00:04:11.549> off<00:04:14.030> come<00:04:15.030> on<00:04:15.060> together

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
we'll cut the liner off come on together

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:22.580 
we'll cut the liner off come on together
quite<00:04:15.599> well<00:04:20.780> the<00:04:21.780> end<00:04:21.900> of<00:04:22.019> the<00:04:22.139> deer

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
quite well the end of the deer

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.170 
quite well the end of the deer
we've<00:04:23.550> cemented<00:04:23.940> all<00:04:24.060> the<00:04:24.150> agents<00:04:24.509> thorns<00:04:24.840> on

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
we've cemented all the agents thorns on

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.629 
we've cemented all the agents thorns on
put<00:04:27.180> the<00:04:27.270> cobbles<00:04:27.570> back<00:04:27.750> in<00:04:27.870> position

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
put the cobbles back in position

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.629 
put the cobbles back in position
and<00:04:29.639> a<00:04:29.699> bit<00:04:29.820> of<00:04:29.880> a<00:04:29.940> tidy<00:04:30.150> up<00:04:30.330> around<00:04:30.449> the<00:04:30.690> edges

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
and a bit of a tidy up around the edges

and a bit of a tidy up around the edges
the<00:04:32.639> water<00:04:32.849> still<00:04:33.150> got<00:04:33.330> to<00:04:33.419> go<00:04:33.570> up<00:04:33.630> by<00:04:33.919> hmmm<00:04:34.919> I

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
the water still got to go up by hmmm I

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.550 
the water still got to go up by hmmm I
don't<00:04:35.280> know<00:04:35.340> maybe<00:04:35.520> 8<00:04:35.820> 9<00:04:36.030> inches<00:04:36.449> or<00:04:36.599> so<00:04:36.750> to

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
don't know maybe 8 9 inches or so to

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.010 
don't know maybe 8 9 inches or so to
cover<00:04:37.770> the<00:04:37.919> exposed<00:04:38.250> liner<00:04:38.580> there<00:04:38.900> but<00:04:39.900> we'll

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
cover the exposed liner there but we'll

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.200 
cover the exposed liner there but we'll
even<00:04:40.229> at<00:04:40.380> this<00:04:40.500> level<00:04:40.880> so<00:04:41.880> it<00:04:41.970> doesn't

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
even at this level so it doesn't

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.879 
even at this level so it doesn't
interfere<00:04:42.360> with<00:04:42.539> the<00:04:42.690> cement<00:04:45.169> so<00:04:46.169> really<00:04:46.470> now

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
interfere with the cement so really now

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:48.740 
interfere with the cement so really now
all<00:04:47.610> there<00:04:47.729> is<00:04:47.820> to<00:04:47.940> do<00:04:48.060> just<00:04:48.330> leave<00:04:48.479> it<00:04:48.599> for<00:04:48.630> a

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
all there is to do just leave it for a

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.770 
all there is to do just leave it for a
couple<00:04:48.960> of<00:04:49.020> years<00:04:49.610> top<00:04:50.610> it<00:04:50.729> up<00:04:50.820> and<00:04:51.000> then<00:04:51.599> get

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
couple of years top it up and then get

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.960 
couple of years top it up and then get
the<00:04:51.990> video<00:04:52.440> of<00:04:52.470> the<00:04:52.770> finished<00:04:53.039> pond<00:04:55.970> that's

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
the video of the finished pond that's

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.360 
the video of the finished pond that's
about<00:04:57.180> it<00:04:57.409> we<00:04:58.409> fill<00:04:58.620> the<00:04:58.710> pond<00:04:58.949> up<00:04:59.070> to<00:04:59.190> about

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
about it we fill the pond up to about

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:04.490 
about it we fill the pond up to about
six<00:04:59.880> inches<00:05:00.180> below<00:05:00.419> its<00:05:01.050> full<00:05:01.889> level<00:05:03.500> that's

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
six inches below its full level that's

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.010 
six inches below its full level that's
to<00:05:04.650> allow<00:05:04.830> the<00:05:04.889> cement<00:05:05.280> that<00:05:05.370> we'll<00:05:05.580> put

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
to allow the cement that we'll put

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.360 
to allow the cement that we'll put
around<00:05:07.020> here<00:05:07.320> to<00:05:07.440> go<00:05:07.590> off<00:05:07.680> properly<00:05:08.130> that<00:05:08.280> was

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
around here to go off properly that was

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.930 
around here to go off properly that was
the<00:05:08.460> last<00:05:08.669> bit<00:05:08.880> of<00:05:09.050> cementing<00:05:10.050> that<00:05:10.169> we<00:05:10.259> did<00:05:10.940> so

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
the last bit of cementing that we did so

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.580 
the last bit of cementing that we did so
it'll<00:05:12.120> still<00:05:12.270> come<00:05:12.419> up<00:05:12.539> probably<00:05:13.139> half<00:05:13.320> way<00:05:13.380> up

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
it'll still come up probably half way up

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.939 
it'll still come up probably half way up
these<00:05:13.740> stones<00:05:14.099> that<00:05:14.250> surround<00:05:14.490> the<00:05:14.789> pond<00:05:15.000> here

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:15.949 
these stones that surround the pond here

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:18.409 
these stones that surround the pond here
it's<00:05:16.949> reasonably<00:05:17.340> clear<00:05:17.610> because<00:05:17.940> most<00:05:18.150> of<00:05:18.300> it

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
it's reasonably clear because most of it

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:21.350 
it's reasonably clear because most of it
is<00:05:18.570> water<00:05:19.380> straight<00:05:19.740> out<00:05:19.800> the<00:05:20.039> top<00:05:20.360> although

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
is water straight out the top although

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.550 
is water straight out the top although
we<00:05:21.449> did<00:05:21.599> put<00:05:21.750> a<00:05:21.780> little<00:05:21.960> bit<00:05:22.139> of<00:05:22.259> pond<00:05:22.500> water

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
we did put a little bit of pond water

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.409 
we did put a little bit of pond water
back<00:05:22.919> in<00:05:23.099> who's<00:05:23.280> probably<00:05:23.490> about<00:05:23.729> three<00:05:24.210> four

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
back in who's probably about three four

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:30.200 
back in who's probably about three four
hundred<00:05:24.690> litres<00:05:24.960> went<00:05:25.139> back<00:05:25.320> in<00:05:28.969> that's<00:05:29.969> it

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
hundred litres went back in that's it

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.339 
hundred litres went back in that's it
