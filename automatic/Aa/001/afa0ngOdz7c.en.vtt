00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:07.210
 Two letters of the renault clio 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.700
 then lead to metamorphosis 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.429
 motorsport takes over the rule 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.650
 about his dns spoiler and aprons 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.840
 blow up the reserved face and 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.420
 show that the mischief in the neck 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.330
 sits fuel consumption and 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.640
 storage options incidental in his 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.580
 sharp version of the geo wants the lust 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:31.210
 to start driving a car 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.950
 the first thing that strikes me 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.200
 honestly not expected in 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.050
 Actually, I always expect small cars 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.720
 still connecting well that's just then 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.480
 the modern variant of a sporty 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.430
 small car two rocker switches around the 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.680
 bull on the horns to pack 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.320
 another possibility is renault 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.960
 for the current clio 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.989
 as it is not to choose as in the 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.370
 automatic mode makes the gear 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.500
 not much fun 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.950
 We therefore go the manual 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:06.600
 alley turn on but also there must 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:08.729
 I say I give the sound command on 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.490
 Paddle and it 's just a break 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.890
 until he does something that has to stop 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.140
 just right there we come see 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:21.330
 better if I am here in the rs 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.800
 mode go and then at full load though 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.320
 others just make that clear 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.619
 faster I'm just there 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.180
 even more sharp in the gear 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.910
 the double clutch transmission as 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.610
 fun brake between driver and power plant 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:39.020
 with smooth 200 hp on the hunt 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.020
 curves and dome 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.890
 Let's just know how it works 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:50.200
 let motor goes flying a bit 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.869
 it's really beautiful here 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.050
 when I'm housing this 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.540
 turbocharged engines 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.040
 he could better hang on the gas it is 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.950
 a still a slight delay 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.140
 When I go from the gas back to the gas 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:08.570
 give it its okay okay 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:11.590
 boost pressure and then the rs also hit 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.460
 still some way 9.4 liters 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.050
 high percentage flow through the 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.050
 Cisterns of the French 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.710
 at renault the steering is yes 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.590
 in fact a real weak spot 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.300
 Of course, that also applies to the 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.930
 classic wise but not for the clio 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.540
 rs 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.110
 but even that has a tradition for 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.540
 curiously, the models always have 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.890
 had much better steering than 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.740
 you normal renault models 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.930
 It is simply the matter of the servo 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.650
 addressing the normal renault 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.020
 models 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.050
 the serveral motto always needs one 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.690
 until he responds and here it is 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.120
 really nice homogeneous only 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.420
 I wish for more consultation 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.460
 just more road contact the 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.670
 basic price for the yellow small car with 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:05.250
 the driving fun guarantee is around 24,000 euros 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.500
 a proud sum on the highway 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.090
 the rs feels comfortable 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.950
 but now he has to shut off 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.110
 route show that even the host 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.560
 tune acceleration brakes 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:19.890
 salon you speed up the 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.530
 manual mode of the transmission press 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.350
 long press the rs drive button 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.830
 I disable the traction control 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:31.410
 full throttle at the same time fight the 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.690
 Traction a bit of the pieps on me now 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.170
 I have to hold 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.000
 here even 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:41.200
 the engine makes really nice radau 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.170
 but 200 ps think somehow a well 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.599
 a little bit more could well be it 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.819
 Also, there are now no 200 ps 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:50.920
 from two or more it is just one 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:54.430
 shared small charged motor 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.459
 first really out in 6 9 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:12.489
 Seconds reaches the strong Frenchman 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:16.510
 100 km h he does well 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:21.090
 after 34 meters, the conversation bites 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.090
 of the clio final in the asphalt 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:32.040
 for the slalom I go to the manual 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.040
 alley from the gearbox and return is ripe 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.700
 somehow compared to his 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.640
 predecessor makes it all a bit 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:45.220
 less refreshing so I have 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.710
 understeer much more he is long ago 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:52.720
 not so little as a real one now 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:57.600
 little disappointed 65 1 km h are on 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.600
 End of the slalom for the krs on the clock 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:06.190
 is he going on is undisputed 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:08.020
 but the clio rs carries the motorsport 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:12.900
 thoughts, however, more in the 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.900
 Body as in chassis and motors
