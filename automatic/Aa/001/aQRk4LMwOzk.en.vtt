00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
phone this hardly has any bulk like I

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.430 
phone this hardly has any bulk like I
said<00:02:21.910> so<00:02:22.060> it's<00:02:22.150> not<00:02:22.270> a<00:02:22.330> big<00:02:22.510> deal<00:02:22.540> and<00:02:22.840> it's

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
said so it's not a big deal and it's

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.520 
said so it's not a big deal and it's
curved<00:02:23.830> nicely<00:02:24.370> like<00:02:24.640> the<00:02:24.820> 920<00:02:25.330> perfectly<00:02:26.140> the

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
curved nicely like the 920 perfectly the

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.730 
curved nicely like the 920 perfectly the
same<00:02:26.740> curve<00:02:27.010> so<00:02:27.280> it<00:02:28.180> almost<00:02:28.500> feels<00:02:29.500> like<00:02:29.590> it's

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
same curve so it almost feels like it's

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.310 
same curve so it almost feels like it's
just<00:02:30.070> a<00:02:30.220> thicker<00:02:30.460> version<00:02:30.730> of<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.060> 920<00:02:31.570> here

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
just a thicker version of the 920 here

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.200 
just a thicker version of the 920 here
it's<00:02:32.530> not<00:02:32.710> going<00:02:32.830> to<00:02:32.920> feel<00:02:33.100> that<00:02:33.280> nice<00:02:33.460> when

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
it's not going to feel that nice when

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.490 
it's not going to feel that nice when
you<00:02:34.300> run<00:02:34.540> your<00:02:34.570> fingers<00:02:34.930> over<00:02:35.020> the<00:02:35.140> buttons

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
you run your fingers over the buttons

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.490 
you run your fingers over the buttons
but<00:02:35.740> the<00:02:36.430> buttons<00:02:36.730> are<00:02:36.850> fully<00:02:37.060> visible<00:02:37.500> unlike

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
but the buttons are fully visible unlike

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.140 
but the buttons are fully visible unlike
the<00:02:38.530> soft<00:02:38.890> cover<00:02:39.130> cases<00:02:39.430> that<00:02:39.670> I<00:02:39.700> reviewed

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
the soft cover cases that I reviewed

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.030 
the soft cover cases that I reviewed
here<00:02:40.300> on<00:02:40.390> this<00:02:40.480> channel<00:02:40.540> they're<00:02:41.410> not<00:02:41.560> covered

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
here on this channel they're not covered

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.220 
here on this channel they're not covered
so<00:02:43.000> you're<00:02:43.300> not<00:02:43.390> actually<00:02:43.600> pushing<00:02:44.140> on

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
so you're not actually pushing on

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.690 
so you're not actually pushing on
anything<00:02:44.500> this<00:02:44.980> is<00:02:45.130> actually<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.550> real

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
anything this is actually the real

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.770 
anything this is actually the real
buttons<00:02:45.910> right<00:02:46.090> here<00:02:46.150> that<00:02:46.360> you're<00:02:46.480> pushing

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
on again I like that as well so it

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.380 
on again I like that as well so it
depends<00:02:50.410> on<00:02:50.470> your<00:02:50.620> personal<00:02:50.950> taste<00:02:51.250> how<00:02:52.239> much

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390
