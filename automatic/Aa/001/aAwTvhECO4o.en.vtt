00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
you can kind of really take that and

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:35.390 
you can kind of really take that and
riff<00:02:34.230> on<00:02:34.350> a<00:02:34.380> little<00:02:34.650> bit<00:02:34.829> and<00:02:35.040> do<00:02:35.190> your<00:02:35.310> own

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
riff on a little bit and do your own

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.910

thing<00:02:35.640> but<00:02:35.850> it's<00:02:36.420> a<00:02:36.600> it's<00:02:36.630> a<00:02:37.019> very<00:02:37.260> important

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
thing but it's a it's a very important

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.440

kind of drink to learn how to make and
can<00:02:40.049> understand<00:02:40.560> how<00:02:40.799> the<00:02:41.220> three<00:02:41.489> things

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
can understand how the three things

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.390 
can understand how the three things
interplay<00:02:42.450> together<00:02:42.720> now<00:02:43.709> because<00:02:43.799> we<00:02:44.190> have

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
interplay together now because we have

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.890 
interplay together now because we have
lime<00:02:44.730> juice<00:02:44.970> in<00:02:45.120> this<00:02:45.239> we're<00:02:45.480> going<00:02:45.570> to<00:02:45.660> shake

lime juice in this we're going to shake
this<00:02:46.049> cocktail<00:02:46.290> because<00:02:46.709> it's<00:02:46.859> cloudy<00:02:47.010> to

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.580 
has its it's created in a different way
it's<00:03:53.150> still<00:03:53.420> in<00:03:53.569> a<00:03:53.629> different<00:03:53.900> process<00:03:54.290> and<00:03:54.319> it

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
has a lot of smokiness to it and usually

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.559 
has a lot of smokiness to it and usually
as<00:03:57.709> it's<00:03:58.129> an<00:03:58.310> interesting<00:03:58.549> dimension<00:04:01.510> so<00:04:02.510> it

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
as it's an interesting dimension so it

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:10.630 
as it's an interesting dimension so it
doesn't<00:04:02.780> take<00:04:02.840> much<00:04:03.049> just<00:04:03.290> a<00:04:03.379> tiny<00:04:03.590> bit

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.789 

get<00:04:11.640> nice<00:04:11.880> and<00:04:11.940> coated<00:04:15.200> and<00:04:16.200> give<00:04:16.440> a<00:04:16.470> little<00:04:16.769> a

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799

little<00:04:17.130> extra<00:04:17.519> flavor<00:04:17.669> and<00:04:18.239> then<00:04:18.389> once<00:04:18.540> you're

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
little extra flavor and then once you're

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.000 
little extra flavor and then once you're
done<00:04:18.660> with<00:04:18.930> that<00:04:18.959> we're<00:04:19.169> gonna<00:04:19.290> double<00:04:19.590> strain

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
done with that we're gonna double strain

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.430 
done with that we're gonna double strain
and<00:04:20.600> double<00:04:21.600> straining<00:04:21.900> catches<00:04:22.260> all<00:04:22.350> the

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
and double straining catches all the

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.890 
and double straining catches all the
small<00:04:22.800> shards<00:04:23.370> of<00:04:23.430> ice<00:04:23.610> and<00:04:24.060> keeps<00:04:24.720> it<00:04:24.870> from

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
small shards of ice and keeps it from

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:35.510 
small shards of ice and keeps it from
watering<00:04:25.320> down<00:04:25.500> the<00:04:25.680> cocktail<00:04:34.400> now<00:04:35.400> you

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
watering down the cocktail now you

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.580 
watering down the cocktail now you
garnish<00:04:35.880> from<00:04:36.000> lime<00:04:36.180> if<00:04:36.360> you<00:04:36.450> want<00:04:36.660> to<00:04:36.900> I'm<00:04:37.200> I

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
garnish from lime if you want to I'm I

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.000 
garnish from lime if you want to I'm I
frequently<00:04:38.250> down<00:04:38.520> I<00:04:38.550> just<00:04:38.730> I<00:04:39.380> generally<00:04:40.380> find

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
frequently down I just I generally find

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.170 
frequently down I just I generally find
it<00:04:41.160> doesn't<00:04:41.400> you<00:04:41.610> know<00:04:41.700> like<00:04:41.880> need<00:04:42.060> the<00:04:42.150> oil

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
it doesn't you know like need the oil

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.700 
it doesn't you know like need the oil
from<00:04:42.510> wine<00:04:42.690> with<00:04:42.900> lime<00:04:43.080> salt<00:04:43.290> Lee<00:04:43.410> produce<00:04:43.650> a

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
from wine with lime salt Lee produce a

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:44.900 
from wine with lime salt Lee produce a
lot<00:04:43.830> of<00:04:43.860> oil<00:04:44.100> so<00:04:44.190> you<00:04:44.310> don't<00:04:44.460> really<00:04:44.550> miss<00:04:44.760> in

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
lot of oil so you don't really miss in

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.450 
lot of oil so you don't really miss in
that<00:04:45.290> but<00:04:46.290> I<00:04:46.320> find<00:04:46.620> that<00:04:46.710> you<00:04:46.830> know<00:04:47.070> what<00:04:47.250> works

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
that but I find that you know what works

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:55.730 
that but I find that you know what works
just<00:04:47.669> as<00:04:47.760> well<00:04:47.940> without<00:04:48.450> a<00:04:48.660> garnish<00:04:49.080> so<00:04:54.740> in

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
just as well without a garnish so in

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.820 
just as well without a garnish so in
this<00:04:55.889> case<00:04:56.540> you<00:04:57.540> definitely<00:04:58.110> get<00:04:58.470> a<00:04:58.500> lot<00:04:58.560> of

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
this case you definitely get a lot of

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.370 
this case you definitely get a lot of
agave<00:04:59.639> you<00:05:00.150> get<00:05:00.300> the<00:05:00.389> tequila<00:05:00.720> I<00:05:01.080> mean<00:05:01.290> it

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
agave you get the tequila I mean it

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 
to it and it just kind of adds a just a

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:19.850 
to it and it just kind of adds a just a
different<00:05:17.310> component<00:05:17.780> but<00:05:18.780> I<00:05:19.050> implore<00:05:19.410> you<00:05:19.620> to

generally<00:05:25.410> I<00:05:25.440> mean<00:05:25.500> if<00:05:25.740> you<00:05:26.100> make<00:05:26.220> it<00:05:26.340> like

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
generally I mean if you make it like

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.610 
generally I mean if you make it like
this<00:05:26.610> and<00:05:26.820> you<00:05:26.910> blend<00:05:27.720> it<00:05:27.840> up<00:05:27.960> maybe<00:05:28.380> it's

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
this and you blend it up maybe it's

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.490 
this and you blend it up maybe it's
totally<00:05:28.890> different<00:05:29.250> but<00:05:29.460> as<00:05:29.729> a<00:05:29.789> rule

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
totally different but as a rule

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.270 
totally different but as a rule
generally<00:05:31.500> should<00:05:31.590> make<00:05:31.770> it<00:05:31.890> as<00:05:31.979> a<00:05:32.039> sour

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
generally should make it as a sour

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.390 
generally should make it as a sour
cocktail<00:05:33.050> and<00:05:34.050> it<00:05:34.620> works<00:05:34.830> really<00:05:34.950> well<00:05:35.070> when

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
cocktail and it works really well when

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.159 
cocktail and it works really well when
you<00:05:35.490> taste<00:05:36.240> it<00:05:36.390> like<00:05:36.510> this<00:05:36.660> I<00:05:36.870> think<00:05:36.930> you'll

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
you taste it like this I think you'll

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:38.960 
you taste it like this I think you'll
find<00:05:37.470> that<00:05:37.710> when<00:05:38.039> you<00:05:38.160> when<00:05:38.430> you<00:05:38.520> create<00:05:38.789> one

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
find that when you when you create one

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.240 
find that when you when you create one
it<00:05:39.960> adds<00:05:40.260> a<00:05:40.350> lot<00:05:40.470> to<00:05:40.530> it<00:05:40.740> and<00:05:40.979> it's<00:05:41.100> a<00:05:41.130> really

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
it adds a lot to it and it's a really

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.219 
it adds a lot to it and it's a really
wonderful<00:05:41.370> cocktail<00:05:41.910> and<00:05:42.270> it's<00:05:42.630> a<00:05:42.870> reason<00:05:43.140> why

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
wonderful cocktail and it's a reason why

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:46.250 
wonderful cocktail and it's a reason why
it's<00:05:43.410> so<00:05:43.530> popular<00:05:44.060> but<00:05:45.060> that's<00:05:45.870> how<00:05:46.020> you<00:05:46.080> make

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
it's so popular but that's how you make

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.070 
it's so popular but that's how you make
the<00:05:46.680> margarita
