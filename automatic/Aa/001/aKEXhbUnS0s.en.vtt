to<00:00:42.930> be<00:00:43.079> in<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.260> key<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.469> B<00:00:43.770> minor<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.850> scale

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
to be in the key of B minor the scale

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:54.020 
to be in the key of B minor the scale
starts<00:00:45.629> at<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.870> 7th<00:00:46.260> fret<00:00:52.640> but<00:00:53.640> you've<00:00:53.820> got<00:00:54.000> to

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
starts at the 7th fret but you've got to

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.420 
starts at the 7th fret but you've got to
realize<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.989> all<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.710> notes<00:00:55.949> in<00:00:56.280> this

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
realize is that all the notes in this

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.740 
realize is that all the notes in this
scale<00:00:56.489> are<00:00:58.010> in<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.699> key<00:01:00.059> they<00:01:00.210> all<00:01:00.390> have<00:01:00.719> a

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
scale are in that key they all have a

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.110 
scale are in that key they all have a
harmony<00:01:01.379> relation<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:02.010> each<00:01:02.039> other<00:01:02.399> in<00:01:02.760> other

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
harmony relation to each other in other

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.329 
harmony relation to each other in other
words<00:01:03.329> it's<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.989> no-brainer<00:01:04.199> if<00:01:04.769> you're<00:01:05.250> in

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
words it's a no-brainer if you're in

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.670 
words it's a no-brainer if you're in
there<00:01:05.460> if<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.820> play<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.720> scale<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.260> matches

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
there if you play the scale that matches

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:15.080 
there if you play the scale that matches
the<00:01:07.830> key<00:01:08.720> especially<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:09.840> scale<00:01:13.970> that's<00:01:14.970> the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
the key especially this scale that's the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.789 
the key especially this scale that's the
pentatonic<00:01:15.509> minor<00:01:15.900> this<00:01:16.140> would<00:01:16.290> be<00:01:16.380> B<00:01:16.560> minor

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
pentatonic minor this would be B minor

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.990 
pentatonic minor this would be B minor
right<00:01:17.360> if<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.600> play<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:18.960> scale<00:01:19.350> over<00:01:19.650> the

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
right if you play that scale over the

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.109 
right if you play that scale over the
b-minor<00:01:21.000> chord<00:01:21.150> progression<00:01:22.070> you<00:01:23.070> can't<00:01:23.400> lose

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
b-minor chord progression you can't lose

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.420 
b-minor chord progression you can't lose
there's<00:01:24.509> not<00:01:24.659> one<00:01:24.990> bad<00:01:25.259> note<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.070> scale

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
there's not one bad note in the scale

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.640 
there's not one bad note in the scale
you<00:01:26.700> can<00:01:27.090> just<00:01:27.420> play<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.780> scale<00:01:28.229> over<00:01:28.560> the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
you can just play the scale over the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.319 
you can just play the scale over the
chord<00:01:28.920> progression<00:01:29.430> for<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.759> matter<00:01:30.060> and

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
chord progression for that matter and

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.950 
chord progression for that matter and
it'll<00:01:31.049> work<00:01:31.790> you<00:01:32.790> don't<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.450> can<00:01:33.600> look<00:01:33.750> like<00:01:33.900> a

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
it'll work you don't you can look like a

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.370 
it'll work you don't you can look like a
pro<00:01:34.259> very<00:01:34.560> easily<00:01:34.829> just<00:01:35.400> by<00:01:36.049> knowing<00:01:37.049> the

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
pro very easily just by knowing the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.100 
pro very easily just by knowing the
scale<00:01:37.740> really<00:01:37.979> well<00:01:38.689> there<00:01:39.689> are<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:39.960> many

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
scale really well there are so many

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.359 
scale really well there are so many
solos<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.890> riffs<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:43.070> rhythm<00:01:44.070> wrists

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
solos and riffs and and rhythm wrists

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.920 
solos and riffs and and rhythm wrists
and<00:01:44.490> things<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:44.880> come<00:01:45.090> from<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.390> scale<00:01:45.720> I

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
and things that come from this scale I

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.590 
and things that come from this scale I
can't<00:01:46.290> even<00:01:46.409> begin<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.860> cover<00:01:47.579> all<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.420> hits

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
can't even begin to cover all the hits

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.260 
can't even begin to cover all the hits
songs<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.259> have<00:01:49.890> used<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.310> scale<00:01:50.700> it's

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
songs that have used this scale it's

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.830 
songs that have used this scale it's
that<00:01:51.540> universal<00:01:52.320> so<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.360> suggest<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.659> get

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
that universal so I suggest that you get

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.899 
that universal so I suggest that you get
to<00:01:54.899> know<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.259> scale<00:01:55.530> really<00:01:55.829> really<00:01:56.159> well<00:01:56.369> and

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
to know the scale really really well and

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.109 
to know the scale really really well and
I'm<00:01:57.570> just<00:01:57.750> going<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.430> play<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> few<00:01:59.820> riffs

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
I'm just going to play a few riffs

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.190 
I'm just going to play a few riffs
really<00:02:00.600> slow<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:02.210> you'll<00:02:03.210> recognize<00:02:03.810> them

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
really slow and you'll recognize them

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.940 
really slow and you'll recognize them
and<00:02:05.180> you<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.750> can<00:02:06.930> see<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.409> comes<00:02:07.649> if<00:02:07.890> you

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
and you you can see that it comes if you

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.440 
and you you can see that it comes if you
look<00:02:08.129> very<00:02:08.160> carefully<00:02:08.580> at<00:02:08.819> my<00:02:08.940> finger<00:02:09.239> board

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
look very carefully at my finger board

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.180 
look very carefully at my finger board
when<00:02:09.569> I'm<00:02:09.660> playing<00:02:09.810> you'll<00:02:10.590> see<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:11.039> the

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
when I'm playing you'll see that the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.760 
when I'm playing you'll see that the
scale

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
scale

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.920 
scale
then<00:02:12.760> I'm<00:02:12.880> only<00:02:13.060> using<00:02:13.210> the<00:02:13.420> notes<00:02:13.660> in<00:02:13.840> this

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
then I'm only using the notes in this

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.690 
then I'm only using the notes in this
scale<00:02:13.990> under<00:02:14.500> those<00:02:14.650> risks<00:02:14.980> come<00:02:15.160> from<00:02:15.520> the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
scale under those risks come from the

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:50.440 
scale under those risks come from the
scale<00:02:16.230> so<00:02:17.230> here<00:02:17.890> we<00:02:17.980> go

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.250
