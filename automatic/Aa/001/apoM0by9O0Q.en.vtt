has just announced the brand new nikon
sb-910<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.600> sb-910<00:00:19.050> is<00:00:19.580> replacing<00:00:20.580> the

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
sb-910 and the sb-910 is replacing the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.620 
sb-910 and the sb-910 is replacing the
sb900<00:00:22.560> which<00:00:23.810> we<00:00:24.810> can<00:00:24.990> say<00:00:25.230> had<00:00:25.650> some<00:00:25.980> issues

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
sb900 which we can say had some issues

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.580 
sb900 which we can say had some issues
that's<00:00:27.630> probably<00:00:27.900> why<00:00:28.019> they<00:00:28.199> came<00:00:28.320> out<00:00:28.470> with

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
that's probably why they came out with

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.339 
that's probably why they came out with
this<00:00:28.680> 9/10<00:00:29.340> in<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.449> shorter<00:00:30.810> period<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.140> time

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
this 9/10 in a shorter period of time

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.049 
this 9/10 in a shorter period of time
than<00:00:31.560> you're<00:00:31.679> normally<00:00:32.189> used<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.520> seeing<00:00:32.579> for

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
than you're normally used to seeing for

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.240 
than you're normally used to seeing for
speedlights<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:34.020> be<00:00:34.170> replaced<00:00:34.590> some<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.130> the

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
speedlights to be replaced some of the

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.459 
speedlights to be replaced some of the
issues<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:36.000> sb900<00:00:36.989> had<00:00:37.170> where<00:00:37.410> they

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
issues that the sb900 had where they

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.299 
issues that the sb900 had where they
were<00:00:37.559> overheating

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
were overheating

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.830 
were overheating
they<00:00:38.700> were<00:00:38.790> overheating<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.360> then<00:00:39.450> shutting

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
they were overheating and then shutting

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.440 
they were overheating and then shutting
off<00:00:40.070> they<00:00:41.070> would<00:00:41.550> let<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.790> shoot<00:00:42.030> until<00:00:42.390> the

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
off they would let you shoot until the

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.850 
off they would let you shoot until the
thing<00:00:42.629> almost<00:00:42.899> caught<00:00:43.079> on<00:00:43.200> fire<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.739> then

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
thing almost caught on fire and then

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.670 
thing almost caught on fire and then
stop<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:45.360> they<00:00:45.719> had<00:00:45.840> issues<00:00:46.140> with<00:00:46.260> overheating

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
stop so they had issues with overheating

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.430 
stop so they had issues with overheating
and<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.850> know<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.239> Ricci<00:00:48.480> Myers<00:00:48.780> my<00:00:49.020> buddy

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
and I know that Ricci Myers my buddy

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.430 
and I know that Ricci Myers my buddy
he<00:00:49.649> had<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.860> tube<00:00:50.610> blow<00:00:51.090> on<00:00:51.270> him<00:00:51.449> out<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.719> his<00:00:51.899> he

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
he had a tube blow on him out of his he

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.220 
he had a tube blow on him out of his he
still<00:00:52.710> uses<00:00:53.129> them<00:00:53.340> but<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.420> know<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.840> changes

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
still uses them but you know the changes

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.360 
still uses them but you know the changes
that<00:00:55.350> I've<00:00:55.440> made<00:00:55.590> from<00:00:55.739> what<00:00:55.920> I've<00:00:56.010> read<00:00:56.190> is

that I've made from what I've read is

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.819 
that I've made from what I've read is
that<00:00:56.879> there's<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.329> thermal<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.199> wrote<00:00:58.680> this

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
that there's a thermal I wrote this

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.099 
that there's a thermal I wrote this
stuff<00:00:59.070> down<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.520> wrote<00:00:59.850> down<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.030> few<00:01:00.480> minor

stuff down I wrote down a few minor

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.720 
stuff down I wrote down a few minor
points<00:01:01.500> because<00:01:01.890> there's<00:01:02.010> not<00:01:02.160> too<00:01:02.399> much<00:01:02.550> to

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
points because there's not too much to

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.969 
points because there's not too much to
talk<00:01:02.910> about<00:01:03.120> there's<00:01:04.049> not<00:01:04.170> too<00:01:04.290> much<00:01:04.439> changed

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.890 
talk about there's not too much changed
it's<00:01:05.159> updated<00:01:05.790> which<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.330> cool<00:01:06.540> it's<00:01:06.689> always

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
it's updated which is cool it's always

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.510 
it's updated which is cool it's always
cool<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.080> get<00:01:07.260> an<00:01:07.320> updated<00:01:07.619> flash

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
cool to get an updated flash

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.490 
cool to get an updated flash
this<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.060> actually<00:01:09.330> an<00:01:09.420> SB<00:01:09.689> 800<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.320> never

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
this is actually an SB 800 I never

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.530 
this is actually an SB 800 I never
updated<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.100> 900<00:01:11.610> not<00:01:12.030> sure<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.420> I'll

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
updated to the 900 not sure that I'll

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.990 
updated to the 900 not sure that I'll
update<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.320> 910<00:01:13.890> but<00:01:14.130> maybe<00:01:14.610> I'll<00:01:14.790> pick

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
update to the 910 but maybe I'll pick

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.480 
update to the 910 but maybe I'll pick
one<00:01:15.210> up<00:01:15.330> at<00:01:15.450> Allen's<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.900> am<00:01:16.110> not<00:01:16.290> sure<00:01:16.560> yet<00:01:16.590> so

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
one up at Allen's I am not sure yet so

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.010 
one up at Allen's I am not sure yet so
basically<00:01:17.939> what<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.360> says<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.600> they<00:01:18.840> made

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
basically what it says is they made

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.399 
basically what it says is they made
efficient<00:01:20.060> more<00:01:21.060> efficient<00:01:21.630> use<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.840> battery

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
efficient more efficient use of battery

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.350 
efficient more efficient use of battery
meaning<00:01:23.250> it's<00:01:23.369> more<00:01:23.700> efficiently<00:01:24.150> going<00:01:24.299> to

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
meaning it's more efficiently going to

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.340 
meaning it's more efficiently going to
use<00:01:24.479> your<00:01:24.600> battery<00:01:24.750> power<00:01:25.049> when<00:01:25.259> you're

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
use your battery power when you're

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.499 
use your battery power when you're
shooting<00:01:25.530> with<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.220> flash<00:01:26.460> which<00:01:27.450> means

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
shooting with the flash which means

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.140 
shooting with the flash which means
hopefully<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:28.080> lasts<00:01:28.320> longer<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:28.979> then<00:01:29.909> more

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
hopefully it lasts longer and then more

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.940 
hopefully it lasts longer and then more
importantly<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.900> says<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.409> enhanced

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
importantly it says that enhanced

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.399 
importantly it says that enhanced
thermal<00:01:32.520> cut<00:01:32.820> out<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.659> what<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.900> enhanced

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
thermal cut out and what the enhanced

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.740 
thermal cut out and what the enhanced
thermal<00:01:34.680> cut<00:01:34.860> out<00:01:34.979> means<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:36.329> your<00:01:36.570> flash

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
thermal cut out means is that your flash

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.780 
thermal cut out means is that your flash
engine<00:01:37.170> isn't<00:01:37.380> going<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.890> overheat<00:01:38.189> as<00:01:38.549> much

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
engine isn't going to overheat as much

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.730 
engine isn't going to overheat as much
because<00:01:39.090> it's<00:01:39.210> not<00:01:39.479> gonna<00:01:39.720> let<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.049> rapidly

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
because it's not gonna let you rapidly

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.520 
because it's not gonna let you rapidly
fire<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.579> shoot<00:01:41.939> too<00:01:42.479> quick<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.200> point

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
fire and shoot too quick to the point

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.499 
fire and shoot too quick to the point
where<00:01:43.799> your<00:01:43.920> flash<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.369> going<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.759> get<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.420> that

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
where your flash is going to get to that

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.940 
where your flash is going to get to that
point<00:01:45.689> where<00:01:45.899> it's<00:01:45.990> too<00:01:46.200> hot<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.680> could

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
point where it's too hot and could

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.460 
point where it's too hot and could
possibly<00:01:47.280> melt<00:01:47.579> down<00:01:47.850> now<00:01:48.390> there's<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.200> lot<00:01:49.350> to

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
possibly melt down now there's a lot to

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.899 
possibly melt down now there's a lot to
be<00:01:49.560> said<00:01:49.590> about<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.979> one<00:01:50.460> people<00:01:50.729> are

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
be said about that one people are

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.639 
be said about that one people are
shooting<00:01:51.180> way<00:01:51.299> too<00:01:51.360> quick<00:01:51.780> at<00:01:51.930> too<00:01:52.049> much<00:01:52.229> power

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
shooting way too quick at too much power

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
that because that isn't good so they

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.620 
that because that isn't good so they

going to withstand the heat a little

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.200 
going to withstand the heat a little
better<00:02:37.130> so<00:02:37.310> they're<00:02:37.460> not<00:02:37.520> going<00:02:37.700> to<00:02:37.760> melt<00:02:37.970> on

flash so those are the main tips the
main<00:02:43.280> points<00:02:43.760> that<00:02:44.060> I<00:02:44.090> read<00:02:44.530> when<00:02:45.530> when<00:02:45.800> you're

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
main points that I read when when you're

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.470 
main points that I read when when you're
looking<00:02:46.100> into<00:02:46.310> getting<00:02:46.400> a<00:02:46.580> flash<00:02:46.820> if<00:02:47.090> you<00:02:47.360> can

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
looking into getting a flash if you can

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.020 
looking into getting a flash if you can
pick<00:02:47.600> up<00:02:47.630> an<00:02:47.840> SB<00:02:48.110> 900<00:02:48.650> used<00:02:48.860> by<00:02:49.430> all<00:02:49.610> means<00:02:49.880> it's

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
pick up an SB 900 used by all means it's

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.430 
pick up an SB 900 used by all means it's
probably<00:02:50.330> a<00:02:50.390> really<00:02:50.450> good<00:02:50.930> deal<00:02:51.200> if<00:02:51.320> you<00:02:51.410> can

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
probably a really good deal if you can

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.350 
probably a really good deal if you can
get<00:02:51.709> it<00:02:51.800> for<00:02:51.920> a<00:02:51.980> good<00:02:52.160> price<00:02:52.220> if<00:02:52.760> you<00:02:53.060> can<00:02:53.180> still

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
get it for a good price if you can still

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.580 
get it for a good price if you can still
get<00:02:53.480> SB<00:02:54.880> 804<00:02:55.880> a<00:02:55.910> good<00:02:56.120> deal<00:02:56.330> at<00:02:57.080> a<00:02:57.140> good<00:02:57.410> price

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
get SB 804 a good deal at a good price

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.490 
get SB 804 a good deal at a good price
it's<00:02:57.860> probably<00:02:58.220> worth<00:02:58.459> doing<00:02:58.940> but<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.959> 910

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
it's probably worth doing but the 910

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.020 
it's probably worth doing but the 910
I'm<00:03:00.740> sure<00:03:01.160> it's<00:03:01.310> gonna<00:03:01.400> be<00:03:01.490> something<00:03:01.880> good

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
I'm sure it's gonna be something good

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.760 
I'm sure it's gonna be something good
again<00:03:02.330> it's<00:03:02.600> corrected<00:03:03.140> some<00:03:03.320> of<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:03.470> issues

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
again it's corrected some of the issues

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.170 
again it's corrected some of the issues
that<00:03:03.800> they<00:03:04.040> had<00:03:04.250> that<00:03:04.580> I<00:03:04.610> don't<00:03:04.910> know<00:03:05.000> if<00:03:05.090> they

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
that they had that I don't know if they

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.080 
that they had that I don't know if they
ever<00:03:05.209> acknowledged<00:03:06.080> in<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.700> sb900<00:03:07.700> but<00:03:08.060> I

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
ever acknowledged in the sb900 but I

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.780 
ever acknowledged in the sb900 but I
guess<00:03:08.300> acknowledging<00:03:08.990> it<00:03:09.170> is<00:03:09.700> coming<00:03:10.700> out

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
guess acknowledging it is coming out

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.390 
guess acknowledging it is coming out
with<00:03:10.910> an<00:03:11.030> SB<00:03:11.330> 9<00:03:11.750> 10<00:03:12.350> which<00:03:12.980> made<00:03:13.220> the

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
with an SB 9 10 which made the

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.920 
with an SB 9 10 which made the
Corrections<00:03:13.850> nothing<00:03:14.450> wrong<00:03:14.570> with<00:03:14.720> making

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
Corrections nothing wrong with making

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.180 
Corrections nothing wrong with making
the<00:03:15.170> Corrections<00:03:15.590> I<00:03:15.740> just<00:03:15.950> hope<00:03:16.040> they

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
the Corrections I just hope they

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.340 
the Corrections I just hope they
