00:00:07.576 --> 00:00:20.968
 Translation and subtitling Cristhian Bourlot 

00:00:21.988 --> 00:00:24.268
 Do things improve? 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.572
 Or do you feel the same? 

00:00:31.628 --> 00:00:35.564
 Will it be easier for you now? 

00:00:36.772 --> 00:00:39.965
 That you have someone to blame 

00:00:40.283 --> 00:00:41.588
 You say: 

00:00:41.874 --> 00:00:43.908
 One Love 

00:00:44.667 --> 00:00:46.444
 A life 

00:00:47.204 --> 00:00:48.899
 When it is a necessity 

00:00:49.828 --> 00:00:51.523
 At night 

00:00:52.204 --> 00:00:54.099
 One Love 

00:00:54.635 --> 00:00:56.626
 Get share it 

00:00:57.324 --> 00:00:59.164
 It leaves you, Mary 

00:00:59.779 --> 00:01:02.907
 If you do not take care of it 

00:01:03.387 --> 00:01:06.116
 Am I not what they expected? 

00:01:08.124 --> 00:01:11.835
 Or did I leave a bad taste in my mouth? 

00:01:13.355 --> 00:01:17.515
 They act as if they had never had love 

00:01:18.267 --> 00:01:21.531
 And they want me to run out of him 

00:01:21.978 --> 00:01:25.514
 Well, it's too late 

00:01:26.138 --> 00:01:28.130
 Tonight 

00:01:28.571 --> 00:01:32.666
 To bring the past to light 

00:01:33.971 --> 00:01:37.522
 We are one, but we are not the same 

00:01:37.771 --> 00:01:40.514
 Let's get help each other 

00:01:40.817 --> 00:01:43.123
 Help each other 

00:01:43.586 --> 00:01:46.443
 One 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.539
 Have you come here for forgiveness? 

00:02:00.314 --> 00:02:03.186
 Have they come to raise the dead? 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.385
 Have you come here to give them to Jesus? 

00:02:10.834 --> 00:02:13.570
 For the lepers in their heads 

00:02:14.162 --> 00:02:17.418
 Well, did I ask too much? 

00:02:17.977 --> 00:02:19.746
 More than a lot? 

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:25.274
 They did not give me anything, and now it's all I have 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.794
 We are one, but we are not the same 

00:02:30.113 --> 00:02:32.580
 If we hurt each other 

00:02:32.841 --> 00:02:34.786
 Then we do it again 

00:02:35.017 --> 00:02:36.017
 You say: 

00:02:36.337 --> 00:02:38.036
 Love is a temple 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:40.419
 Love is a sacred law 

00:02:40.866 --> 00:02:43.128
 Love is a temple 

00:02:43.457 --> 00:02:45.657
 Love is the sacred law 

00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:48.401
 They invite me to spend 

00:02:48.681 --> 00:02:50.913
 But then they make me drag 

00:02:51.233 --> 00:02:54.880
 And I can not stand 

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:56.848
 What you all have to give 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:02:59.857
 When all they have is to hurt 

00:03:00.321 --> 00:03:01.600
 One Love 

00:03:02.833 --> 00:03:04.113
 A blood 

00:03:05.296 --> 00:03:09.192
 One life, they have to do what is expected of you 

00:03:10.488 --> 00:03:12.255
 A life 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.161
 With others 

00:03:15.664 --> 00:03:16.688
 Sister 

00:03:16.904 --> 00:03:20.272
 And my brother 

00:03:20.936 --> 00:03:24.296
 A life, but we are not the same 

00:03:24.544 --> 00:03:27.408
 Let's get help each other 

00:03:28.024 --> 00:03:29.992
 Help each other 

00:03:30.312 --> 00:03:33.064
 One 

00:03:35.568 --> 00:03:38.598
 One 

00:03:40.911 --> 00:03:43.815
 One 

00:03:46.113 --> 00:03:49.599
 One
