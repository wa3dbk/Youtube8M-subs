00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
grey and background color I think I'll

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.030 
grey and background color I think I'll
do<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.939> navy<00:01:06.240> blue<00:01:06.659> just<00:01:07.409> be<00:01:07.530> careful<00:01:07.920> when

choosing<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.580> background<00:01:09.119> color<00:01:09.270> because<00:01:09.689> you

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
choosing a background color because you

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.600 
choosing a background color because you
don't<00:01:09.990> want<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.619> clash<00:01:10.860> with<00:01:10.890> your<00:01:11.100> text

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
don't want it to clash with your text

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.730 
don't want it to clash with your text
and<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.240> don't<00:01:12.420> want<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.720> be<00:01:12.840> too<00:01:13.260> striking
