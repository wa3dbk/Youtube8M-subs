okay and we're going to whip our own
cream<00:00:11.330> which<00:00:11.539> is<00:00:11.690> typically<00:00:12.080> what<00:00:12.200> I<00:00:12.410> do<00:00:12.590> I

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
cream which is typically what I do I

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.960 
cream which is typically what I do I
find<00:00:13.880> it<00:00:14.059> holds<00:00:14.540> a<00:00:14.630> lot<00:00:14.809> longer<00:00:15.170> if<00:00:15.710> I<00:00:16.340> whip<00:00:16.820> it

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
find it holds a lot longer if I whip it

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.310 
find it holds a lot longer if I whip it
by<00:00:17.119> hand<00:00:17.450> because<00:00:17.630> I'm<00:00:17.930> not<00:00:18.050> going<00:00:18.259> to

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
by hand because I'm not going to

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.830 
by hand because I'm not going to
incorporate<00:00:18.619> as<00:00:19.160> much<00:00:19.369> air<00:00:19.730> as<00:00:20.119> I<00:00:20.330> would<00:00:20.599> with

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
incorporate as much air as I would with

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.560 
incorporate as much air as I would with
an<00:00:20.990> electric<00:00:21.500> mixer<00:00:21.730> ok<00:00:22.730> this<00:00:22.939> takes<00:00:23.210> practice

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
an electric mixer ok this takes practice

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.650 
an electric mixer ok this takes practice
and<00:00:24.199> it<00:00:25.130> also<00:00:27.429> takes<00:00:28.429> some<00:00:28.699> elbow<00:00:29.029> grease<00:00:29.060> as

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
and it also takes some elbow grease as

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.310 
and it also takes some elbow grease as

to note is I have my bowl set down in

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.990 
to note is I have my bowl set down in
the<00:01:11.780> sink<00:01:12.080> ok<00:01:12.470> because<00:01:12.649> it's<00:01:12.890> really<00:01:13.190> hard<00:01:13.640> to

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
the sink ok because it's really hard to

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.900 
the sink ok because it's really hard to
hold<00:01:14.179> the<00:01:14.330> bowl<00:01:14.630> and<00:01:14.899> whip<00:01:15.709> I<00:01:15.950> tend<00:01:16.580> to<00:01:16.640> change

from my right hand to my left hand and
back<00:01:20.060> again<00:01:20.300> because<00:01:21.259> it<00:01:21.530> does<00:01:21.950> take<00:01:22.399> a<00:01:22.640> little

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
back again because it does take a little

00:01:23.090 --> 00:02:11.630 
back again because it does take a little
bit
