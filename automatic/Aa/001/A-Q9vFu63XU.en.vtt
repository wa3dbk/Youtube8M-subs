00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
one by one so it could get a little

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.240

tedious<00:01:29.700> but<00:01:29.909> once<00:01:30.420> you're<00:01:30.570> done<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:31.020> think<00:01:31.439> it

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
tedious but once you're done I think it

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.690 
tedious but once you're done I think it
ties<00:01:32.520> everything<00:01:32.700> together<00:01:33.360> nicely<00:01:33.869> and

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
ties everything together nicely and

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.920 
ties everything together nicely and
here's<00:01:35.700> how<00:01:35.850> they<00:01:36.000> look<00:01:36.210> without<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.689> lights
