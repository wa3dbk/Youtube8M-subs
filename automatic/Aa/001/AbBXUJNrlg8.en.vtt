because<00:00:40.980> Cynthia<00:00:41.780> the<00:00:42.780> size<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.320> and

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
because Cynthia the size of it and

we are going to give it a service before
it<00:00:56.320> goes<00:00:56.440> out<00:00:56.680> so<00:00:56.890> I<00:00:56.950> think<00:00:57.160> it<00:00:57.280> is<00:00:57.310> at<00:00:57.490> the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:57.580 
it goes out so I think it is at the

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.310 
it goes out so I think it is at the
minute<00:00:57.820> just<00:00:58.330> running<00:00:58.630> just<00:00:58.750> a<00:00:58.840> little<00:00:58.870> bit

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
minute just running just a little bit

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.980 
minute just running just a little bit
rich<00:00:59.670> up<00:01:00.670> until<00:01:01.030> we<00:01:01.150> picked<00:01:01.420> it<00:01:01.540> up<00:01:01.630> the<00:01:01.780> last

rich up until we picked it up the last

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.870 
rich up until we picked it up the last
time<00:01:02.200> and<00:01:02.350> half<00:01:02.470> of<00:01:02.590> 10<00:01:02.770> years<00:01:02.980> and<00:01:03.250> hadn't

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
used it a great deal and certainly

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.210 
used it a great deal and certainly
hasn't<00:01:05.230> been<00:01:05.379> used<00:01:05.560> a<00:01:05.680> great<00:01:05.830> deal<00:01:05.890> with<00:01:06.160> the

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
it just to say runs pretty cleanly just

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.040 
it just to say runs pretty cleanly just
when<00:01:18.790> you<00:01:18.880> start<00:01:18.940> up<00:01:19.300> there's<00:01:19.510> just<00:01:19.750> feeling<00:01:20.020> a

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
when you start up there's just feeling a

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.100 
when you start up there's just feeling a

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
little bit a little bit of fluffing try

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.960 
little bit a little bit of fluffing try
and<00:01:23.200> make<00:01:23.320> it<00:01:23.350> answer<00:01:25.200> back<00:01:26.200> to<00:01:26.229> the<00:01:26.440> way<00:01:26.590> an

injected v8 shipping just running a
little<00:01:30.250> bit<00:01:30.520> so<00:01:30.790> richly<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.479> man<00:01:31.630> laughing

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
little bit so richly the man laughing

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.530 
little bit so richly the man laughing
and<00:01:35.310> burnside<00:01:36.310> performance<00:01:36.850> is<00:01:36.940> exceptional

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
and burnside performance is exceptional

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.690 
and burnside performance is exceptional
it's<00:01:37.930> some<00:01:38.530> allegedly<00:01:39.100> fitted<00:01:39.399> with<00:01:39.490> Range

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
it's some allegedly fitted with Range

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.160 
it's some allegedly fitted with Range
Rover<00:01:39.910> dips<00:01:40.180> dips<00:01:40.600> and<00:01:40.810> I<00:01:40.840> think<00:01:41.050> that

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
Rover dips dips and I think that

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:48.230 
Rover dips dips and I think that
probably<00:01:41.290> is<00:01:41.530> the<00:01:41.619> case<00:01:41.800> given<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:42.190> gearing

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.380

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
long-wheelbase brakes which a bit bigger

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.280 
long-wheelbase brakes which a bit bigger
it's<00:01:56.820> only<00:01:57.030> got<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.240> break<00:01:57.420> serve<00:01:57.659> on<00:01:57.869> Devon<00:01:58.170> it

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
it's only got a break serve on Devon it

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.120 
it's only got a break serve on Devon it
having<00:01:58.890> said<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.490> brakes<00:02:00.770> not<00:02:01.770> quite<00:02:02.009> as

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
having said that the brakes not quite as

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.440 
having said that the brakes not quite as
good<00:02:02.220> as<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.430> performance<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:03.030> still<00:02:03.270> need

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
good as the performance you still need

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.870 
good as the performance you still need
to<00:02:03.630> run<00:02:03.899> plan<00:02:04.710> ahead<00:02:04.890> should<00:02:05.280> we<00:02:05.369> sign<00:02:05.549> giving

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
to run plan ahead should we sign giving

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.669 
to run plan ahead should we sign giving
a<00:02:05.939> bit<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.210> shaft<00:02:06.450> but<00:02:07.289> I<00:02:07.350> think<00:02:07.530> that's

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
a bit of a shaft but I think that's

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.759 
a bit of a shaft but I think that's
going<00:02:07.830> to<00:02:07.920> be<00:02:08.009> expected<00:02:08.869> and<00:02:09.869> stories<00:02:10.500> rubble

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
going to be expected and stories rubble

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.300 
going to be expected and stories rubble
on<00:02:10.860> this<00:02:10.979> one<00:02:11.130> it's<00:02:11.280> not<00:02:11.400> wondering<00:02:11.730> about<00:02:11.790> so

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
on this one it's not wondering about so

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.360 
on this one it's not wondering about so
really<00:02:14.310> very<00:02:14.519> good<00:02:14.670> indeed<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.569> it<00:02:16.220> this<00:02:17.220> is

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
really very good indeed and it this is

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.150 
really very good indeed and it this is
down<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.730> road<00:02:17.880> with<00:02:18.180> them<00:02:18.450> no<00:02:19.230> nasty<00:02:19.739> clunks

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
down the road with them no nasty clunks

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.820 
down the road with them no nasty clunks
groans<00:02:20.989> rattles<00:02:21.989> sort<00:02:22.290> of<00:02:22.380> a<00:02:22.440> farm<00:02:22.680> and
