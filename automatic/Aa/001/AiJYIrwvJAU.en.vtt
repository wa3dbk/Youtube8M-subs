acw-r<00:01:56.820> which<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.390> prey<00:01:57.750> decent<00:01:58.350> weapon<00:01:58.710> if<00:01:58.799> I

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
acw-r which is a prey decent weapon if I

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.440 
acw-r which is a prey decent weapon if I
say<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.070> myself<00:01:59.159> I've<00:01:59.640> been<00:01:59.790> using<00:01:59.939> this<00:02:00.119> quite

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
say so myself I've been using this quite

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.870 
say so myself I've been using this quite
a<00:02:00.479> little<00:02:00.719> bit<00:02:00.899> recently<00:02:01.890> with<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.340> engineer

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
a little bit recently with the engineer

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.300 
a little bit recently with the engineer
class<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.990> performs<00:02:04.500> pretty<00:02:04.799> well<00:02:05.070> it's

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
class and it performs pretty well it's

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.300 
class and it performs pretty well it's
like<00:02:05.460> having<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:06.060> sort<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.979> more<00:02:07.979> long-range

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
like having a sort of more long-range

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.830 
like having a sort of more long-range
tape<00:02:09.000> gun

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
tape gun

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.479 
tape gun
which<00:02:10.289> actually<00:02:10.530> can<00:02:10.860> perform<00:02:11.250> at<00:02:11.340> close

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
which actually can perform at close

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.710 
which actually can perform at close
range<00:02:11.700> as<00:02:11.819> well<00:02:11.849> do<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.269> the<00:02:12.330> high<00:02:12.450> fire

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
range as well do it to the high fire

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.290 
range as well do it to the high fire
rate<00:02:13.250> and<00:02:14.250> it's<00:02:14.489> good<00:02:14.640> it's<00:02:14.790> good<00:02:14.879> for<00:02:15.239> an

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
rate and it's good it's good for an

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.490 
rate and it's good it's good for an
all-round<00:02:15.629> gun<00:02:15.810> you<00:02:15.959> know<00:02:15.989> you<00:02:16.140> can<00:02:16.379> actually

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
not very effective I've used it quite a

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.349 
not very effective I've used it quite a
little<00:03:31.709> bit<00:03:31.889> I<00:03:32.190> used<00:03:32.849> that<00:03:33.000> a<00:03:33.030> little<00:03:33.209> bit<00:03:33.269> the

other day with the what site was it

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.650 
other day with the what site was it
there<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:38.160> Cobra<00:03:38.519> say<00:03:38.700> and<00:03:38.970> it's<00:03:39.540> actually

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
there the Cobra say and it's actually

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.059 
there the Cobra say and it's actually
pretty<00:03:40.079> decent<00:03:40.260> if<00:03:40.560> you've<00:03:40.650> got<00:03:40.829> an<00:03:40.919> average

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
pretty decent if you've got an average

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.920 
pretty decent if you've got an average
say<00:03:41.459> enough<00:03:41.819> you've<00:03:41.940> got<00:03:42.090> decent<00:03:42.329> seitan

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
say enough you've got decent seitan

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.500 
say enough you've got decent seitan
instead<00:03:43.380> of<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:44.099> scope<00:03:44.489> I<00:03:44.730> just<00:03:45.209> feel<00:03:45.359> the

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
instead of the the scope I just feel the

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.140 
instead of the the scope I just feel the
scope<00:03:45.810> just<00:03:46.169> makes<00:03:47.069> it<00:03:47.310> a<00:03:47.489> bit<00:03:47.790> more<00:03:47.910> difficult

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
scope just makes it a bit more difficult

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.960 
scope just makes it a bit more difficult
to<00:03:48.480> work<00:03:48.690> with<00:03:48.750> and<00:03:49.139> I<00:03:50.130> move<00:03:50.400> on<00:03:50.519> to<00:03:50.639> that<00:03:50.700> gun

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
to work with and I move on to that gun

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.129 
to work with and I move on to that gun
there<00:03:51.150> and<00:03:51.269> get<00:03:51.389> my<00:03:51.480> two<00:03:51.540> kills<00:03:51.870> for<00:03:52.049> that

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
there and get my two kills for that

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:53.809 
there and get my two kills for that
within<00:03:52.319> about<00:03:52.530> two<00:03:52.769> seconds<00:03:53.310> so<00:03:53.430> that's<00:03:53.609> good

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
within about two seconds so that's good

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.059 
within about two seconds so that's good
on<00:03:54.209> to<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.540> sniper<00:03:54.930> rifles<00:03:55.290> no<00:03:55.470> no<00:03:55.739> I'm<00:03:55.859> not<00:03:56.010> a

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.830 
on to the sniper rifles no no I'm not a
good<00:03:56.220> sniper<00:03:56.459> this<00:03:56.880> has<00:03:57.000> been<00:03:57.120> established<00:03:57.750> in

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
good sniper this has been established in

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.379 
good sniper this has been established in
the<00:03:57.900> past<00:03:58.200> but<00:03:58.799> I<00:03:58.859> tend<00:03:59.459> to<00:03:59.549> be<00:03:59.910> able<00:03:59.970> to<00:04:00.209> work

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
the past but I tend to be able to work

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:02.599 
the past but I tend to be able to work
with<00:04:00.599> the<00:04:00.690> m4<00:04:00.989> 17<00:04:01.410> actually<00:04:01.859> quite<00:04:02.069> decently<00:04:02.489> I

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
with the m4 17 actually quite decently I

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:05.120 
with the m4 17 actually quite decently I
don't<00:04:03.299> tend<00:04:03.569> to<00:04:03.630> struggle<00:04:03.900> with<00:04:04.049> it<00:04:04.260> because

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
don't tend to struggle with it because

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.800 
don't tend to struggle with it because
of<00:04:05.280> course<00:04:05.579> you<00:04:05.700> only<00:04:05.730> need<00:04:05.970> one<00:04:06.180> two<00:04:06.389> shorts

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
of course you only need one two shorts

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.539 
of course you only need one two shorts
on<00:04:06.959> them<00:04:07.109> and<00:04:07.200> it<00:04:07.319> has<00:04:07.440> a<00:04:07.470> decent<00:04:07.709> fiery<00:04:08.130> on<00:04:08.430> it

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
on them and it has a decent fiery on it

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.240 
on them and it has a decent fiery on it
so<00:04:08.669> then<00:04:08.819> 417<00:04:09.359> is<00:04:09.419> not<00:04:09.569> too<00:04:09.750> bad<00:04:10.019> but<00:04:10.260> once<00:04:11.130> I<00:04:11.190> do

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
so then 417 is not too bad but once I do

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.819 
so then 417 is not too bad but once I do

just<00:04:56.660> breeze<00:04:56.930> a<00:04:56.960> victory<00:04:57.530> but<00:04:57.680> I<00:04:57.740> don't<00:04:57.919> think

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
just breeze a victory but I don't think

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.560 
just breeze a victory but I don't think
it's<00:04:58.310> anywhere<00:04:58.610> near<00:04:58.669> as<00:04:58.880> entertaining<00:04:59.360> to
