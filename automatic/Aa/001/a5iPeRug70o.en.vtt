take this leg and I have two options I
teach<00:03:13.620> my<00:03:13.769> beginners<00:03:14.159> to<00:03:14.310> have<00:03:14.430> versatility

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
teach my beginners to have versatility

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.680 
teach my beginners to have versatility
option<00:03:15.989> one<00:03:16.199> is<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.680> heel<00:03:16.980> comes<00:03:17.370> in<00:03:17.669> which<00:03:18.569> is

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
option one is the heel comes in which is

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.119 
option one is the heel comes in which is
actually<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.079> best<00:03:19.260> way<00:03:19.440> because<00:03:19.769> that's<00:03:19.949> how

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:20.129 
actually the best way because that's how

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:21.280 
actually the best way because that's how
you're<00:03:20.280> going<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.459> cause<00:03:20.639> a<00:03:20.669> knock<00:03:20.970> out

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
you're going to cause a knock out

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.839 
you're going to cause a knock out
because<00:03:22.290> that<00:03:22.440> heel<00:03:22.739> is<00:03:22.889> so<00:03:23.190> tough<00:03:23.489> and<00:03:23.639> so

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
because that heel is so tough and so

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:26.539 
because that heel is so tough and so
hard<00:03:24.090> but<00:03:25.079> the<00:03:25.230> second<00:03:25.650> way<00:03:25.769> I<00:03:25.799> show<00:03:26.099> is<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.400> put

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
hard but the second way I show is to put

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.240 
hard but the second way I show is to put
the<00:03:26.669> flat<00:03:26.970> of<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.120> foot<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:27.949> just<00:03:28.949> kind<00:03:29.159> of

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
the flat of the foot and just kind of

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.670 
the flat of the foot and just kind of
slap<00:03:30.120> them<00:03:30.359> because<00:03:31.169> I<00:03:31.260> figure<00:03:31.530> that

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
slap them because I figure that

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.430 
slap them because I figure that
