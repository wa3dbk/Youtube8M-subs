00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:17.099
 National coach Emanuel Sheffer 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.800
 Up to the grass and the players composition 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.133
 Similar to the one that overcame Australia's national team 

00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:24.499
 In her first game in Mexico 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.133
 Israel loses to Uruguay 2: 0 

00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:29.899
 And finishes its game with the Italian national team 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.500
 A team that qualified for the final game in 1970 

00:00:34.833 --> 00:00:38.833
 But the great moments of the Israeli team were in Toluca 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.300
 In the race against Sweden 

00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:45.533
 Sweden saw Israel as an easy prey on their way to the quarter finals 

00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:49.399
 Sweden score a goal in the 58th minute and take the lead at 1: 0 

00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:55.566
 Torson's gate was scored from a distinctly distinct position of Grip 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.933
 Still, there was no complaint 

00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:01.599
 It was only natural for Sweden to overcome Israel 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.200
 Only the camera eye revealed the gate that was not there 

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:10.699
 In this situation, Israel's players will fight back 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.000
 To record one of the most glorious chapters in their feet 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.133
 In our football of all time 

00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:20.066
 Rosen dribbles. Rosen is too high 

00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:22.132
 Passes the midline a lot. 10 meters 

00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:23.433
 Passing the ball to Feigenbaum 

00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:25.499
 Feigenbaum moved back to Spiegel 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.266
 Spiegel dribbles with the ball close to 16 meters 

00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:29.299
 Looking for the opportunity to kick 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.400
 Passing the ball to Spiegler, Spigler did not find it 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.866
 Spiegeler started ... a kick 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.233
 Spiegel! Do it! Beauty 

00:01:39.233 --> 00:01:43.233
 What a gate! What a beauty of our actor 

00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:46.799
 Such a goal can also be in the final 

00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:49.866
 Thirty yards, shell 

00:01:50.533 --> 00:01:55.066
 Half a meter high to the right side of the Swedish gate. 1: 1 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.200
 What a beauty. The blue and white flags are now flying here 

00:02:02.533 --> 00:02:04.366
 In distant Toluca
