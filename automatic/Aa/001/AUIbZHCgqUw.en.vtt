the d3x with all the hype around the d4

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.060 
the d3x with all the hype around the d4
and<00:00:12.519> the<00:00:12.670> d800<00:00:13.480> nowadays<00:00:13.960> it's<00:00:14.620> easy<00:00:14.860> to

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.070 
and the d800 nowadays it's easy to

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.029 
and the d800 nowadays it's easy to
forget<00:00:15.400> that<00:00:15.460> the<00:00:16.150> d3<00:00:16.359> X<00:00:16.779> is<00:00:16.990> actually<00:00:17.769> still

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:18.039

almost four years ago and it still

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.580 
almost four years ago and it still
stands<00:00:33.699> up<00:00:33.940> as<00:00:34.180> one<00:00:34.449> of<00:00:34.629> the<00:00:34.899> most<00:00:35.140> outstanding

with that a lot and that files coming

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.549 
with that a lot and that files coming
off<00:00:45.519> it<00:00:45.670> were<00:00:45.850> just<00:00:46.089> incredible<00:00:47.079> for<00:00:47.140> now

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
off it were just incredible for now

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:49.229 
off it were just incredible for now
they're<00:00:47.859> incredible<00:00:48.399> for<00:00:48.609> four<00:00:48.789> years<00:00:49.059> ago

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
they're incredible for four years ago

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.470 
they're incredible for four years ago
just<00:00:50.050> remarkable<00:00:50.890> now<00:00:51.399> the<00:00:51.460> downside<00:00:51.910> of<00:00:52.239> it

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
just remarkable now the downside of it

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.840 
just remarkable now the downside of it
was<00:00:52.660> that<00:00:52.989> the<00:00:53.140> ISO<00:00:53.739> performance<00:00:53.920> really<00:00:54.670> was

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
was that the ISO performance really was

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.290 
was that the ISO performance really was
limited<00:00:55.449> but<00:00:55.989> for<00:00:56.559> four<00:00:57.010> years<00:00:57.280> ago<00:00:57.460> and<00:00:57.879> for

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
limited but for four years ago and for

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.739 
limited but for four years ago and for
24<00:00:58.839> megapixel<00:00:59.620> it<00:00:59.949> was<00:01:00.579> you<00:01:01.030> know<00:01:01.149> reasonable

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:01.749 
24 megapixel it was you know reasonable

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:04.290 
24 megapixel it was you know reasonable
now<00:01:02.350> a<00:01:02.739> lot<00:01:03.070> has<00:01:03.249> changed<00:01:03.280> so<00:01:03.850> that<00:01:04.059> wouldn't

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
now a lot has changed so that wouldn't

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.750 
now a lot has changed so that wouldn't
be<00:01:04.360> acceptable<00:01:04.510> the<00:01:05.050> d800<00:01:05.830> is<00:01:05.950> producing<00:01:06.520> much

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
be acceptable the d800 is producing much

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.410 
be acceptable the d800 is producing much
much<00:01:07.240> better<00:01:07.540> ISO<00:01:08.110> performance<00:01:08.730> but<00:01:09.730> so<00:01:09.970> given

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
much better ISO performance but so given

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.080 
much better ISO performance but so given
that<00:01:10.450> Nocona<00:01:10.930> saying<00:01:11.320> the<00:01:11.760> d800<00:01:12.760> doesn't

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
that Nocona saying the d800 doesn't

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.030 
that Nocona saying the d800 doesn't
replace<00:01:13.330> that<00:01:13.600> the<00:01:13.690> d4<00:01:14.140> doesn't<00:01:14.500> replace<00:01:14.800> it

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
replace that the d4 doesn't replace it

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.800 
replace that the d4 doesn't replace it
what<00:01:15.460> is<00:01:15.640> going<00:01:16.030> to<00:01:16.060> replace<00:01:16.240> it<00:01:16.510> they've

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
what is going to replace it they've

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.800 
what is going to replace it they've
always<00:01:17.020> had<00:01:17.410> a<00:01:17.650> fast<00:01:18.370> and<00:01:18.760> a<00:01:18.880> high<00:01:19.090> res<00:01:19.450> in

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
always had a fast and a high res in

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.640 
always had a fast and a high res in
their<00:01:20.260> full-size<00:01:20.940> professional<00:01:21.940> lineup

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
their full-size professional lineup

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.500 
their full-size professional lineup
Canon<00:01:23.650> seemed<00:01:24.400> to<00:01:24.610> have<00:01:24.730> gone<00:01:24.910> down<00:01:25.090> the<00:01:25.300> route

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
Canon seemed to have gone down the route

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.180 
Canon seemed to have gone down the route
with<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:25.810> 1<00:01:26.080> DX<00:01:26.410> of<00:01:26.620> having<00:01:26.920> one<00:01:27.160> that

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
with the 1 DX of having one that

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.760 
with the 1 DX of having one that
combines<00:01:27.790> them<00:01:28.090> both<00:01:28.140> but<00:01:29.140> I<00:01:29.170> don't<00:01:29.590> think

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
combines them both but I don't think

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.440 
combines them both but I don't think
that<00:01:29.950> Nick<00:01:30.070> honor<00:01:30.280> doing<00:01:30.640> that<00:01:30.790> I<00:01:30.820> still<00:01:31.180> think

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
that Nick honor doing that I still think

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.110 
that Nick honor doing that I still think
that<00:01:31.510> the<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:32.410> d4<00:01:32.860> is<00:01:32.980> a<00:01:33.010> high<00:01:33.250> speed<00:01:33.610> one<00:01:33.820> and

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
that the the d4 is a high speed one and

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.630 
that the the d4 is a high speed one and
that<00:01:34.240> will<00:01:34.420> eventually<00:01:34.570> see<00:01:35.320> a<00:01:35.620> high<00:01:36.070> res<00:01:36.370> one

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
that will eventually see a high res one

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.300 
that will eventually see a high res one
come<00:01:36.880> out<00:01:37.000> so<00:01:37.840> that<00:01:37.870> begs<00:01:38.260> the<00:01:38.440> question<00:01:38.920> you

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
come out so that begs the question you

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.660 
come out so that begs the question you
know<00:01:39.430> with<00:01:39.610> the<00:01:39.820> da<00:01:40.000> v3<00:01:40.780> X<00:01:41.020> being<00:01:41.380> the<00:01:41.710> second

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
know with the da v3 X being the second

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.550 
know with the da v3 X being the second
oldest<00:01:43.060> camera<00:01:43.510> that's<00:01:43.840> currently<00:01:44.230> on<00:01:44.320> the

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
oldest camera that's currently on the

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.980 
oldest camera that's currently on the
list<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:44.920> d700<00:01:45.700> is<00:01:45.820> actually<00:01:46.210> the<00:01:46.360> oldest<00:01:46.780> one

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
list the d700 is actually the oldest one

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.630 
list the d700 is actually the oldest one
that<00:01:47.200> they're<00:01:47.350> still<00:01:47.560> selling<00:01:47.860> so<00:01:48.250> what<00:01:48.460> can

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
that they're still selling so what can

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.120 
that they're still selling so what can
they<00:01:48.760> do<00:01:48.820> to<00:01:49.000> replace<00:01:49.720> it<00:01:49.990> they<00:01:50.260> could<00:01:50.590> put<00:01:51.100> a

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
they do to replace it they could put a

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.630 
they do to replace it they could put a
tricked-out<00:01:52.350> d800<00:01:53.350> sensor<00:01:53.800> into<00:01:54.220> a<00:01:54.250> full

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
tricked-out d800 sensor into a full

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.030 
tricked-out d800 sensor into a full
sized<00:01:54.880> body<00:01:55.270> and<00:01:55.600> maybe<00:01:56.290> get<00:01:56.530> even<00:01:56.860> better

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
sized body and maybe get even better

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.980 
sized body and maybe get even better
