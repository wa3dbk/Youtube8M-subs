get to which I do show you in the video

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:52.639 
get to which I do show you in the video
even<00:00:51.690> though<00:00:51.809> both<00:00:51.870> good<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.350> kind<00:00:52.559> of

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
even though both good is kind of

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.020 
even though both good is kind of
pointless<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:53.190> do<00:00:53.309> think<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.730> glitch<00:00:53.879> is

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
pointless I do think the glitch is

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.700 
pointless I do think the glitch is
pretty<00:00:54.270> cool<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:54.899> also<00:00:55.050> think<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.440> could<00:00:55.620> be

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
pretty cool and I also think it could be

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.139 
pretty cool and I also think it could be
quite<00:00:55.829> useful<00:00:56.309> when<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.670> multiplayer

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
quite useful when the multiplayer

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.389 
quite useful when the multiplayer
feature<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.660> released<00:00:58.019> so<00:00:58.620> anyway<00:00:58.949> guys<00:00:59.129> I
