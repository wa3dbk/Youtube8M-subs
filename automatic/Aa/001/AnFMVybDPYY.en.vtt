going<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.730> feature<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:21.270> trick<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.140> trade

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
going to feature a trick of the trade

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.820 
going to feature a trick of the trade
using<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.099> Petzl<00:00:23.489> ID<00:00:24.320> currently<00:00:25.320> we<00:00:25.650> are

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
using the Petzl ID currently we are

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.640 
using the Petzl ID currently we are
using<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.519> Petzl<00:00:26.910> ID<00:00:27.179> large<00:00:27.750> but<00:00:28.439> you<00:00:28.500> can

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
using the Petzl ID large but you can

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.640 
using the Petzl ID large but you can
also<00:00:28.769> pick<00:00:29.070> up<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.519> Petzl<00:00:29.849> ID<00:00:30.150> small<00:00:30.869> or<00:00:31.439> the

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
also pick up the Petzl ID small or the

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.590 
also pick up the Petzl ID small or the
pencil<00:00:31.830> rig<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.699> trick<00:00:33.059> will<00:00:33.239> work<00:00:33.390> with

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
pencil rig this trick will work with

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.680 
pencil rig this trick will work with
both<00:00:34.670> okay<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:35.730> we're<00:00:36.120> gonna<00:00:36.210> load<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.540> ID

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
both okay so we're gonna load the ID

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.530 
both okay so we're gonna load the ID
again<00:00:37.050> learn<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.769> diagram<00:00:38.190> inside<00:00:38.610> we<00:00:39.390> want

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
again learn the diagram inside we want

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.299 
again learn the diagram inside we want
the<00:00:39.960> rope<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.409> going<00:00:40.650> to<00:00:40.739> or<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.159> end<00:00:41.280> of

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
the rope that is going to or the end of

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.470 
the rope that is going to or the end of
the<00:00:41.370> rope<00:00:41.520> that's<00:00:41.670> coming<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.090> our<00:00:42.210> load

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
the rope that's coming to our load

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.080 
the rope that's coming to our load
coming<00:00:43.199> out<00:00:43.289> here<00:00:44.160> out<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.430> bottom<00:00:44.730> the

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
coming out here out of the bottom the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.029 
coming out here out of the bottom the
part<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.420> we're<00:00:45.510> going<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.780> tend<00:00:46.410> as<00:00:46.620> we

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
part that we're going to tend as we

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.380 
part that we're going to tend as we
belay<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.340> load<00:00:47.609> is<00:00:47.820> going<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.030> come<00:00:48.180> out<00:00:48.270> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
belay the load is going to come out the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.580 
belay the load is going to come out the
top<00:00:48.539> here<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.850> we're<00:00:50.850> gonna<00:00:50.940> form<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.359> loop

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
top here so we're gonna form the loop

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.200 
top here so we're gonna form the loop
we're<00:00:52.590> going<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.859> introduce<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.340> rope<00:00:53.489> we're

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
we're going to introduce the rope we're

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.509 
we're going to introduce the rope we're
gonna<00:00:54.300> close<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:57.260> and<00:00:58.260> then<00:00:58.440> make<00:00:59.399> our

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
gonna close it and then make our

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:02.810 
gonna close it and then make our
connection<00:01:00.260> okay<00:01:01.260> so<00:01:01.320> here<00:01:01.739> our<00:01:01.769> ID<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.370> loaded

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
connection okay so here our ID is loaded

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.369 
connection okay so here our ID is loaded
and<00:01:03.179> one<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.570> problems<00:01:03.929> that<00:01:03.960> people<00:01:04.199> have

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
and one of the problems that people have

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.740 
and one of the problems that people have
with<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.920> ID<00:01:05.070> frequently<00:01:05.789> is<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.240> if<00:01:06.600> you

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
with the ID frequently is that if you

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.630 
with the ID frequently is that if you
are<00:01:06.840> not<00:01:07.050> under<00:01:07.410> a<00:01:07.440> very<00:01:07.619> heavy<00:01:07.920> load<00:01:08.250> or<00:01:08.460> if

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
are not under a very heavy load or if

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.130 
are not under a very heavy load or if
you're<00:01:08.759> operating<00:01:09.030> on<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.270> steep<00:01:09.600> angle<00:01:09.810> or<00:01:10.080> a

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
you're operating on a steep angle or a

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.090 
you're operating on a steep angle or a
slope<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.649> not<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.800> true<00:01:11.070> vertical

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
slope and not a true vertical

slope and not a true vertical
environment

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
environment

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.230 
environment
the<00:01:13.200> device<00:01:13.530> has<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.860> tendency<00:01:14.429> to<00:01:14.640> kick<00:01:14.849> over

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
the device has a tendency to kick over

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.809 
the device has a tendency to kick over
into<00:01:15.599> the<00:01:15.690> panic<00:01:16.050> mode<00:01:16.289> thereby<00:01:16.920> making<00:01:17.700> it

00:01:17.809 --> 00:01:17.819 
into the panic mode thereby making it

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:20.150 
into the panic mode thereby making it
hard<00:01:18.149> to<00:01:18.390> lower<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.080> light<00:01:19.349> load<00:01:19.560> or<00:01:19.890> again

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
hard to lower a light load or again

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.210 
hard to lower a light load or again
progress<00:01:20.940> down<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.270> steep<00:01:21.630> angle<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.649> a<00:01:22.950> way

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
progress down a steep angle so a way

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.100 
progress down a steep angle so a way
that<00:01:23.369> we<00:01:23.459> can<00:01:23.610> get<00:01:23.759> around<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:24.240> again<00:01:24.989> if

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
that we can get around this again if

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.620 
that we can get around this again if
done<00:01:25.289> appropriately<00:01:25.410> is<00:01:26.130> rather<00:01:27.060> than<00:01:27.390> taking

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
done appropriately is rather than taking

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.050 
done appropriately is rather than taking
the<00:01:27.869> device<00:01:28.200> in<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.860> normal<00:01:29.220> blade<00:01:29.489> position

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
the device in the normal blade position

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.839 
the device in the normal blade position
which<00:01:30.539> is<00:01:30.690> this<00:01:31.160> we're<00:01:32.160> simply<00:01:32.520> going<00:01:32.670> to

00:01:32.839 --> 00:01:32.849 
which is this we're simply going to

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:34.639 
which is this we're simply going to
leave<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.390> device<00:01:33.690> in<00:01:34.050> the<00:01:34.349> unlock<00:01:34.619> position

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
leave the device in the unlock position

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:37.760 
leave the device in the unlock position
and<00:01:35.660> still<00:01:36.660> maintaining<00:01:37.050> our<00:01:37.229> brake<00:01:37.500> hand

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
and still maintaining our brake hand

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.160 
and still maintaining our brake hand
here<00:01:38.039> on<00:01:38.069> the<00:01:39.060> end<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.539> the<00:01:39.599> line<00:01:39.750> coming<00:01:39.989> out

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
here on the end of the line coming out

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.010 
here on the end of the line coming out
we're<00:01:40.830> going<00:01:41.069> to<00:01:41.190> rotate<00:01:41.399> the<00:01:41.819> device<00:01:42.020> 90

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
we're going to rotate the device 90

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.949 
we're going to rotate the device 90
degrees<00:01:43.410> and<00:01:44.069> thereby<00:01:44.459> allowing<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.390> cam<00:01:45.660> to

00:01:45.949 --> 00:01:45.959 
degrees and thereby allowing the cam to

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:48.199 
degrees and thereby allowing the cam to
be<00:01:46.050> defeated<00:01:46.349> now<00:01:46.649> it's<00:01:47.220> imperative<00:01:47.670> than

00:01:48.199 --> 00:01:48.209 
be defeated now it's imperative than

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:49.910 
be defeated now it's imperative than
when<00:01:48.330> you<00:01:48.390> do<00:01:48.569> this<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.959> don't<00:01:49.140> death<00:01:49.619> grip

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
when you do this you don't death grip

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.919 
when you do this you don't death grip
this<00:01:50.099> thing<00:01:50.399> because<00:01:51.060> if<00:01:51.179> anything<00:01:51.509> happens

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:51.929 
this thing because if anything happens

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:53.990 
this thing because if anything happens
you<00:01:52.530> want<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:52.890> thing<00:01:53.129> to<00:01:53.369> be<00:01:53.459> able<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.640> jerk

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
you want this thing to be able to jerk

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.400 
you want this thing to be able to jerk
out<00:01:54.209> of<00:01:54.300> your<00:01:54.479> hands<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:54.899> into<00:01:54.989> the<00:01:55.140> correct

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 
out of your hands and into the correct

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.350 
out of your hands and into the correct
orientation<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:56.819> will<00:01:56.940> catch<00:01:57.119> your

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
orientation so that it will catch your

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:06.280 
orientation so that it will catch your
load<00:01:57.569> and<00:01:58.500> that's<00:01:58.590> our<00:01:58.830> trick
