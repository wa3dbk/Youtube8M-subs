00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.630 
anyways uh you know camera technology is
not<00:01:44.020> new<00:01:44.290> you<00:01:44.500> know<00:01:44.530> motion<00:01:45.009> sensor<00:01:45.369> stuff

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
not new you know motion sensor stuff

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.120 
not new you know motion sensor stuff
that<00:01:45.909> that's<00:01:46.150> not<00:01:46.270> new<00:01:46.509> this<00:01:47.140> stuff<00:01:47.409> is<00:01:47.649> uh

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
that that's not new this stuff is uh

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.340 
that that's not new this stuff is uh
this<00:01:48.670> stuff<00:01:48.880> is<00:01:49.030> not<00:01:49.479> new<00:01:49.630> either<00:01:49.840> but<00:01:50.229> it's

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
this stuff is not new either but it's

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.260 
this stuff is not new either but it's
actually<00:01:50.530> becoming<00:01:51.159> affordable<00:01:51.850> in<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.060> past

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
actually becoming affordable in the past

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.609 
actually becoming affordable in the past
few<00:01:52.420> years<00:01:52.689> so<00:01:52.899> that's<00:01:53.079> what's<00:01:53.290> really

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
few years so that's what's really

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.410 
few years so that's what's really
exciting<00:01:53.799> about<00:01:54.130> it<00:01:54.280> and<00:01:54.460> especially<00:01:54.610> that

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
exciting about it and especially that

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.210 
exciting about it and especially that
they're<00:01:55.600> now<00:01:55.720> integrating<00:01:56.409> that<00:01:56.439> into<00:01:56.560> gaming

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
they're now integrating that into gaming

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.999 
they're now integrating that into gaming
and<00:01:58.119> so<00:01:58.299> before<00:01:58.750> you<00:01:58.990> can<00:01:59.020> really<00:01:59.409> use<00:01:59.560> these

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
and so before you can really use these

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:01.859 
and so before you can really use these
things<00:02:00.310> unless<00:02:00.549> you<00:02:00.850> paid<00:02:01.479> a<00:02:01.509> lot<00:02:01.719> of<00:02:01.750> money

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
things unless you paid a lot of money

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.870 
things unless you paid a lot of money
unless<00:02:02.350> you<00:02:02.799> got<00:02:02.920> some<00:02:03.130> really<00:02:03.250> cheap<00:02:03.610> or

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
unless you got some really cheap or

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.660 
unless you got some really cheap or
broken<00:02:04.240> one<00:02:04.479> and<00:02:05.380> like<00:02:05.920> they've<00:02:06.340> never<00:02:06.579> been

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
broken one and like they've never been

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.699 
broken one and like they've never been
like<00:02:07.180> on<00:02:07.420> the<00:02:07.540> main<00:02:07.750> consoles<00:02:08.350> right<00:02:08.530> so

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
like on the main consoles right so

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.259 
like on the main consoles right so
you've<00:02:08.860> never<00:02:09.040> been<00:02:09.280> able<00:02:09.399> to<00:02:09.670> like<00:02:09.790> and<00:02:10.090> get<00:02:10.239> a

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
you've never been able to like and get a

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:12.210 
you've never been able to like and get a
few<00:02:10.420> our<00:02:10.540> heads<00:02:10.780> on<00:02:10.929> the<00:02:11.110> 360<00:02:11.769> or<00:02:11.890> anything

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
few our heads on the 360 or anything

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.339 
few our heads on the 360 or anything
like<00:02:12.250> that<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:13.510> so<00:02:13.750> these<00:02:13.900> things<00:02:14.140> have

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
like that and so these things have

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.110 
like that and so these things have
actually<00:02:14.530> been<00:02:14.920> used<00:02:15.129> for<00:02:15.400> military<00:02:15.550> and

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
actually been used for military and

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.000 
actually been used for military and
other<00:02:16.209> uses<00:02:16.959> and<00:02:17.200> training<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:17.739> stuff<00:02:17.890> like

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
other uses and training and stuff like

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.600 
other uses and training and stuff like
that<00:02:18.069> but

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
that but

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.640 
that but
again<00:02:19.090> you<00:02:19.390> know<00:02:19.510> it's<00:02:19.780> going<00:02:20.020> on<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.320> the<00:02:20.410> big

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
again you know it's going on to the big

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.280 
again you know it's going on to the big
main<00:02:21.370> consoles<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.210> big<00:02:22.390> two<00:02:22.600> heads<00:02:22.930> of

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
main consoles the big two heads of

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.860 
main consoles the big two heads of
console<00:02:23.800> gaming<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:24.400> of<00:02:25.210> course<00:02:25.510> that<00:02:25.570> being

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
console gaming and of course that being

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.380 
console gaming and of course that being
the<00:02:25.930> xbox<00:02:26.440> one<00:02:26.650> and<00:02:26.680> ps4<00:02:27.090> Microsoft<00:02:28.090> and<00:02:28.240> Sony

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
the xbox one and ps4 Microsoft and Sony

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.240 
the xbox one and ps4 Microsoft and Sony
so<00:02:28.960> that's<00:02:29.140> what's<00:02:29.380> so<00:02:29.530> exciting<00:02:29.770> about<00:02:29.950> it<00:02:30.100> is

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
so that's what's so exciting about it is

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.580 
so that's what's so exciting about it is
going<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.430> be<00:02:30.460> competitive<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:31.870> thus<00:02:32.290> that

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
going to be competitive and thus that

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.680 
going to be competitive and thus that
means<00:02:33.010> it's<00:02:33.280> going<00:02:33.400> to<00:02:33.550> be<00:02:33.880> they're<00:02:34.480> going<00:02:34.630> to

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
means it's going to be they're going to

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.630 
means it's going to be they're going to
be<00:02:34.810> fighting<00:02:35.020> over<00:02:35.230> our<00:02:35.470> dollars<00:02:35.890> and<00:02:36.190> so<00:02:36.400> of

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
be fighting over our dollars and so of

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.160 
be fighting over our dollars and so of
course<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.180> prices<00:02:37.510> are<00:02:37.630> going<00:02:37.690> to<00:02:37.810> drop<00:02:37.960> and

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
course the prices are going to drop and

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.810 
course the prices are going to drop and
they<00:02:38.260> already<00:02:38.410> have<00:02:38.710> dropped<00:02:39.040> in<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.610> past

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
they already have dropped in the past

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.910 
they already have dropped in the past
few<00:02:39.940> years<00:02:40.180> so<00:02:40.420> yeah<00:02:41.140> pretty<00:02:41.440> exciting<00:02:41.800> but

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
few years so yeah pretty exciting but

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.860 
few years so yeah pretty exciting but
what<00:02:42.070> do<00:02:42.130> I<00:02:42.250> think<00:02:42.280> about<00:02:42.550> all<00:02:42.700> this<00:02:43.030> of<00:02:43.240> course

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
what do I think about all this of course

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.630 
what do I think about all this of course
Microsoft<00:02:44.080> is<00:02:44.500> going<00:02:44.740> to<00:02:44.890> develop<00:02:45.310> a<00:02:45.400> VR

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
Microsoft is going to develop a VR

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.970 
Microsoft is going to develop a VR
headset<00:02:45.670> soon<00:02:46.540> of<00:02:46.720> some<00:02:46.930> kind<00:02:47.170> and<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.800> thing

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
headset soon of some kind and the thing

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.040 
headset soon of some kind and the thing
about<00:02:48.010> VR<00:02:48.640> headsets<00:02:49.150> though<00:02:49.420> is<00:02:49.630> that<00:02:49.660> they're

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
about VR headsets though is that they're

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.040 
about VR headsets though is that they're
really<00:02:50.350> like<00:02:51.220> third<00:02:51.490> Vance<00:02:51.790> stuff<00:02:52.270> the<00:02:52.510> oculus

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
really like third Vance stuff the oculus

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.810 
really like third Vance stuff the oculus
rift<00:02:53.380> if<00:02:53.560> I<00:02:53.650> said<00:02:53.860> that<00:02:53.980> correctly<00:02:54.130> is<00:02:54.490> a<00:02:54.520> bit

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
rift if I said that correctly is a bit

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.400 
rift if I said that correctly is a bit
older<00:02:55.150> than<00:02:55.180> these<00:02:55.390> new<00:02:55.660> headsets<00:02:56.140> and<00:02:56.320> they

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
older than these new headsets and they

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.770 
older than these new headsets and they
had<00:02:56.860> a<00:02:56.890> Kickstarter<00:02:57.520> for<00:02:57.550> support<00:02:58.239> I<00:02:58.480> mean

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
had a Kickstarter for support I mean

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.630 
had a Kickstarter for support I mean
they<00:02:59.080> actually<00:02:59.110> had<00:02:59.650> to<00:02:59.890> get<00:03:00.070> support<00:03:00.430> but

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
they actually had to get support but

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.580 
they actually had to get support but
with<00:03:01.000> these<00:03:01.150> corporations<00:03:01.660> with<00:03:02.050> their<00:03:02.230> deep

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
with these corporations with their deep

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.650 
with these corporations with their deep
deep<00:03:02.860> pockets<00:03:03.430> they<00:03:03.850> can<00:03:04.030> really<00:03:04.209> fund<00:03:04.540> these

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
deep pockets they can really fund these

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.420 
deep pockets they can really fund these
things<00:03:04.959> to<00:03:05.140> be<00:03:05.230> efficient<00:03:05.680> cheeping<00:03:06.070> quality

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
things to be efficient cheeping quality

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.400 
things to be efficient cheeping quality
written<00:03:06.700> like<00:03:06.850> I<00:03:06.970> said<00:03:07.360> a<00:03:07.390> second<00:03:07.720> ago<00:03:07.780> but<00:03:07.930> the

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
written like I said a second ago but the

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.720 
written like I said a second ago but the
competition<00:03:08.980> is<00:03:09.040> really<00:03:09.100> going<00:03:09.520> to<00:03:09.610> be

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
competition is really going to be

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.190 
competition is really going to be
important<00:03:10.239> and<00:03:10.300> surely<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:10.750> prices<00:03:11.080> will

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
important and surely the prices will

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.780 
important and surely the prices will
drop<00:03:11.260> at<00:03:11.620> decent<00:03:11.950> prices<00:03:12.010> sometime<00:03:12.610> this<00:03:12.730> year

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
drop at decent prices sometime this year

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.060 
drop at decent prices sometime this year
and<00:03:13.150> don't<00:03:14.140> hit<00:03:14.260> shelves<00:03:14.470> and<00:03:14.680> all<00:03:14.739> that<00:03:14.920> great
