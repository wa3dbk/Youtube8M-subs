00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.770
 hi to all my friends many of you 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.930
 they contacted asking me to speak 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.900
 of cortana problems in the short case 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.610
 it didn't work then I repeat one more 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.590
 time windows 10 is a system 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.719
 operating new and need to do it 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.670
 update 15 st that anyone has gods 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.949
 Windows functionality problems 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.800
 if you really don't even open the 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.230
 start button and search bar some 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.060
 success I recommend trying 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.330
 update video card drivers 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.529
 it seems that nothing really has to do with it 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.390
 those solve the majority of 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.670
 problems if not here you have to wait 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.370
 the update is therefore still necessary 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.140
 go back to the previous windows as I have 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.210
 said in other videos simply 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.739
 I understand that now maybe it's difficult if 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.719
 there is no for the start bar 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.879
 however substance settings 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.850
 it should be opened to go here 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.789
 update and restore security e 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.520
 return to windows 8.1 windows 7 comes 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.320
 wait for the problem to resolve then 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.940
 if the problem is only the bar 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.980
 search that is not displayed 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.290
 simply right-click on the bar 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.330
 on the cortana application bar 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.330
 make sure the show is ticked 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.060
 search box other things when 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.170
 click on the microphone and you talk 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.810
 if it tells you there are problems 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.000
 could be internet because cortana 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.460
 needs the internet line if you are 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.200
 downloading at great speed so there is 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.360
 a file that is occupying the band o 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.610
 someone else is occupying the whole 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.200
 especially the router band them 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.700
 see why it takes a lot of time e 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.110
 work and then there is a mistake this is 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.240
 an internet problem so it is not 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.400
 own cortana that does not work is that 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.110
 the internet line is saturated 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.630
 if, however, it always fails you see that 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.040
 does not even recognize the spoken word e 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.930
 think it's a problem of 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.490
 microphone the first thing to see this 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.110
 then right click on the symbol of 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.110
 volume recording devices 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.259
 then here we have the check on 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.850
 microphone that will use cortana that one 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.799
 default and as you can see the 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.790
 nymphs rise and fall this wants 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.719
 say my microphone is 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.880
 working 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.140
 we can also do a test by opening a 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.420
 program as can be the 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.759
 sound recorder now from sites in the 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.020
 my case any program that 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.770
 connects the microphone with 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.470
 the software so see if 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.940
 the microphone works or not 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.770
 clicking on another microphone e 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.830
 doing default then change the 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.060
 default microphone I go back to this 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.620
 so another thing to do then is 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:25.840
 go in here and write microphone 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.340
 click set up microphone and redo the 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.840
 microphone configuration comes 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.240
 go ahead let me read a sentence 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.490
 so you see even if microphone works 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.140
 this another try again and then with a 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.750
 conclude this is all that 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.520
 we can do the last thing 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.110
 as I said in my previous video 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.370
 then the deactivation of coltan 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.440
 went we go here we write cortana 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.600
 cortal setting research 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.980
 check first on the no then on yes then 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.690
 we do a deactivation one 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.150
 cortana reactivation we accept 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.580
 the privacy statement let's see if 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.110
 so it unlocks and if it works of course 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.060
 I'm not telling you that if the problem is 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.980
 temporary try restarting the 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.250
 computer maybe this is resolved 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.990
 all I can tell you supported 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.310
 what you can experience if 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.480
 there are other procedures in no le 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.070
 I know 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.750
 I think you simply have to do it 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.540
 then upgrade the operating system 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.880
 the microphone is not working or not 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.530
 in short, he recognizes you in speech or 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.550
 short not working then from 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.140
 update windows 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.459
 in this case you see it has also opened 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.490
 alone because she heard the famous one 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.490
 phrase 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.240
 so just the video card driver 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.490
 in case of problems with opening here and 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.080
 search then open the browser 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.100
 and that perhaps the only thing that can be done 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.150
 always open for nothing at all here and 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.880
 look for drives of your video card 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.260
 I also made a video where I spoke 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.200
 driver update 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.040
 the video can be searched under windows 10 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.170
 problems 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.120
 fabrizio ghera away if you write like that 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.340
 on youtube you find my video and 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.110
 I'm talking about how drivers are updated 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.220
 explains a little how it is done 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.220
 this is all a greeting to all
