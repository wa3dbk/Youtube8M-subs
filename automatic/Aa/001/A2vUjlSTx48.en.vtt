00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:20.189 
in a survival mode I think to you will
have<00:05:15.819> to<00:05:16.029> pay<00:05:16.060> its<00:05:16.740> I<00:05:17.789> believe<00:05:18.789> 10<00:05:19.300> euros<00:05:19.930> or

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:20.199 
have to pay its I believe 10 euros or

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:23.399 
have to pay its I believe 10 euros or
ten<00:05:20.620> dollars<00:05:21.189> at<00:05:21.400> the<00:05:21.520> moment<00:05:21.909> and<00:05:22.289> when<00:05:23.289> it

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:23.409 
ten dollars at the moment and when it

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:27.410 
ten dollars at the moment and when it
gets<00:05:23.620> the<00:05:23.949> data<00:05:24.909> testing<00:05:25.900> it<00:05:26.199> will<00:05:26.439> be

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:27.420 
gets the data testing it will be

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.740 
gets the data testing it will be
20<00:05:28.420> euros<00:05:28.750> so<00:05:29.700> it<00:05:30.700> would<00:05:30.880> be<00:05:31.000> a<00:05:31.030> good<00:05:31.330> idea<00:05:31.390> to

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
20 euros so it would be a good idea to
