00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
hopefully not gonna fail too hard and

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.490 
hopefully not gonna fail too hard and
yeah<00:01:27.330> it's<00:01:27.659> not<00:01:27.780> too<00:01:27.810> bad<00:01:27.930> though<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.409> don't

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
yeah it's not too bad though I don't

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.560 
yeah it's not too bad though I don't
mind<00:01:28.740> it's<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.579> cool<00:01:29.729> level<00:01:29.970> it's<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.360> short

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
mind it's a cool level it's a short

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.929 
mind it's a cool level it's a short
level<00:01:30.840> but<00:01:31.350> it's<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.860> all<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.640> short<00:01:32.850> in

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
level but it's it all of it is short in

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.999 
level but it's it all of it is short in
some<00:01:33.150> ways<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.540> log<00:01:33.659> in<00:01:33.780> others<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.290> can't

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
some ways and log in others and I can't

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.170 
some ways and log in others and I can't
really<00:01:35.100> explain<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.579> until<00:01:35.820> we<00:01:35.880> get<00:01:36.030> further

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
really explain that until we get further

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.420 
really explain that until we get further
along<00:01:36.420> anyway<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:37.259> yeah<00:01:37.500> all<00:01:37.710> up<00:01:38.070> there<00:01:38.220> on<00:01:38.340> the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
along anyway so yeah all up there on the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.280 
along anyway so yeah all up there on the
left-hand<00:01:38.640> side<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.909> this<00:01:39.060> room<00:01:39.240> there's<00:01:40.170> all

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
left-hand side of this room there's all

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.170 
left-hand side of this room there's all
just<00:01:40.470> for<00:01:40.530> secrets<00:01:40.890> secrets<00:01:41.579> secrets<00:01:41.909> secrets

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
just for secrets secrets secrets secrets

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.480 
just for secrets secrets secrets secrets
nothing<00:01:42.540> else<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:43.170> will<00:01:43.290> find<00:01:43.560> here<00:01:43.979> we<00:01:44.310> can't

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
nothing else you will find here we can't

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.560 
nothing else you will find here we can't
really<00:01:44.579> get<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:44.970> other<00:01:45.090> half<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.450> room

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
really get to the other half of the room

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.090 
really get to the other half of the room
because<00:01:45.720> this<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.079> big<00:01:46.320> metal<00:01:46.619> bars<00:01:46.829> here

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
because this is big metal bars here

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.580 
because this is big metal bars here
however<00:01:47.790> there<00:01:48.210> is<00:01:48.329> this<00:01:48.479> weird<00:01:48.659> like<00:01:48.899> whole

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
however there is this weird like whole

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.710 
however there is this weird like whole
thing<00:01:49.890> in<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.040> wall<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.430> there<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.000> also<00:01:51.210> a

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
thing in the wall and there is also a

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.510 
thing in the wall and there is also a
fresher<00:01:52.229> place<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:52.680> this<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:52.979> pressure<00:01:53.310> plate

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
fresher place so this is pressure plate

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.480 
fresher place so this is pressure plate
it<00:01:54.180> lights<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.720> fire<00:01:55.049> in<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.740> hole<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.310> then

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
it lights a fire in that hole and then

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.310 
it lights a fire in that hole and then
the<00:01:56.700> fire<00:01:56.939> wait<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.750> can't<00:01:57.960> really<00:01:58.049> see<00:01:58.140> it

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
the fire wait you can't really see it

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.749 
the fire wait you can't really see it
very<00:01:58.409> clearly<00:01:58.500> right<00:01:58.799> now<00:01:58.920> but<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.520> the

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
very clearly right now but that the

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.399 
very clearly right now but that the
light<00:02:00.299> that<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.630> fire<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.049> supposedly

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
light that this fire is supposedly

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.840 
light that this fire is supposedly
casting<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:01.950> like<00:02:02.070> being<00:02:02.250> shined<00:02:02.549> through

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
casting is like being shined through

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.429 
casting is like being shined through
that<00:02:02.969> pillar<00:02:03.180> in<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.390> middle<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.719> then<00:02:04.229> it's

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
that pillar in the middle and then it's

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.170 
that pillar in the middle and then it's
costing<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.829> light<00:02:05.040> over<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.430> windows<00:02:05.759> over

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
costing a light over the windows over

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.570 
costing a light over the windows over
there<00:02:06.210> okay<00:02:06.860> how<00:02:07.860> does<00:02:07.920> that<00:02:08.129> help<00:02:08.250> us<00:02:08.429> we

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
there okay how does that help us we

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.949 
there okay how does that help us we
don't<00:02:08.700> know<00:02:08.849> but<00:02:09.030> also<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.599> pressure<00:02:09.780> plate

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
don't know but also the pressure plate

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.199 
don't know but also the pressure plate
is<00:02:10.140> open<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.739> gate<00:02:10.920> there<00:02:11.099> on<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.340> left<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:11.819> I

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
is open the gate there on the left and I

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.240 
is open the gate there on the left and I
get<00:02:12.390> there<00:02:12.569> on<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.780> right<00:02:12.959> but

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
get there on the right but

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.740 
get there on the right but
we<00:02:13.370> get<00:02:13.520> off<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:13.790> even<00:02:14.000> if<00:02:14.060> we<00:02:14.150> try<00:02:14.300> and<00:02:14.330> sprint

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
we get off and even if we try and sprint

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.170 
we get off and even if we try and sprint
to<00:02:15.020> get<00:02:15.200> through<00:02:15.380> the<00:02:15.470> gate<00:02:15.650> or<00:02:15.920> do<00:02:16.850> crazy

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
to get through the gate or do crazy

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.610 
to get through the gate or do crazy
flips<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:17.600> stuff<00:02:17.690> cuz<00:02:18.020> that's<00:02:18.290> what<00:02:18.440> life<00:02:18.590> is

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
flips and stuff cuz that's what life is

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.740 
flips and stuff cuz that's what life is
good<00:02:18.950> for<00:02:19.160> and<00:02:19.400> we<00:02:19.970> still<00:02:20.180> can't<00:02:20.390> make<00:02:20.540> it

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
good for and we still can't make it

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.480 
good for and we still can't make it
through<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:21.080> gates<00:02:21.260> you<00:02:21.560> still<00:02:22.070> can't<00:02:22.220> do<00:02:22.370> it

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
through the gates you still can't do it

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.070 
through the gates you still can't do it
so<00:02:22.700> we<00:02:23.390> got<00:02:23.480> to<00:02:23.570> find<00:02:23.660> a<00:02:23.780> different<00:02:23.870> way

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
so we got to find a different way

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.270 
so we got to find a different way
through<00:02:24.260> of<00:02:24.680> course<00:02:24.920> there's<00:02:25.100> loads<00:02:25.250> of

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
through of course there's loads of

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.770 
through of course there's loads of
scaffolding<00:02:25.730> here<00:02:25.910> I<00:02:26.030> went<00:02:26.390> off<00:02:26.450> on<00:02:26.510> it<00:02:26.660> on<00:02:26.750> a

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
scaffolding here I went off on it on a

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.570 
scaffolding here I went off on it on a
big<00:02:26.930> speech<00:02:27.140> last<00:02:27.410> time<00:02:27.620> I<00:02:27.710> did<00:02:27.770> this<00:02:27.860> video<00:02:28.490> as

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
big speech last time I did this video as

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.030 
big speech last time I did this video as
well<00:02:28.610> now<00:02:29.600> I<00:02:29.810> love<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.170> design<00:02:30.440> of<00:02:30.470> this<00:02:30.709> level

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
well now I love the design of this level

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.940 
well now I love the design of this level
that<00:02:31.250> if<00:02:32.090> you<00:02:32.180> live<00:02:32.360> in<00:02:32.390> like<00:02:32.540> America<00:02:33.020> or<00:02:33.200> like

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
that if you live in like America or like

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.140 
that if you live in like America or like
one<00:02:34.100> of<00:02:34.130> these<00:02:34.280> newer<00:02:34.430> countries<00:02:34.640> or<00:02:34.940> whatever

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
one of these newer countries or whatever

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.000 
one of these newer countries or whatever
and<00:02:35.330> there's<00:02:35.540> not<00:02:35.690> much<00:02:35.870> like<00:02:36.290> history<00:02:36.770> around

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
and there's not much like history around

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.470 
and there's not much like history around
or<00:02:37.250> they<00:02:37.490> aren't<00:02:37.760> like<00:02:37.850> loads<00:02:38.090> of<00:02:38.180> big

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
or they aren't like loads of big

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.330 
or they aren't like loads of big
cathedrals<00:02:39.170> and<00:02:39.230> massive<00:02:39.530> old<00:02:39.740> churches<00:02:40.070> and

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
cathedrals and massive old churches and

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.010 
cathedrals and massive old churches and
stuff<00:02:40.400> you<00:02:40.820> might<00:02:40.940> not<00:02:41.300> be<00:02:41.450> too<00:02:41.600> familiar<00:02:41.780> with

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
stuff you might not be too familiar with

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.020 
stuff you might not be too familiar with
this<00:02:42.200> but<00:02:42.740> a<00:02:42.770> lot<00:02:43.010> of<00:02:43.040> old<00:02:43.310> structures<00:02:43.850> that

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
this but a lot of old structures that

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.729 
this but a lot of old structures that
still<00:02:44.300> exists<00:02:44.750> and<00:02:44.930> like<00:02:45.110> out<00:02:45.260> in<00:02:45.290> towns<00:02:45.590> and

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
still exists and like out in towns and

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.620 
still exists and like out in towns and
stuff<00:02:45.980> now<00:02:46.250> where<00:02:46.970> they're<00:02:47.090> so<00:02:47.270> old<00:02:47.450> and

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
stuff now where they're so old and

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.570 
stuff now where they're so old and
decrepit<00:02:48.080> essentially<00:02:48.800> they're<00:02:49.100> starting<00:02:49.550> to

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
decrepit essentially they're starting to

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.330 
decrepit essentially they're starting to
fall<00:02:49.790> apart<00:02:49.820> so<00:02:50.450> a<00:02:50.660> lot<00:02:51.260> of<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.530> time<00:02:51.770> on<00:02:52.070> a<00:02:52.130> lot

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
fall apart so a lot of the time on a lot

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.760 
fall apart so a lot of the time on a lot
of<00:02:52.370> these<00:02:52.520> things<00:02:52.580> you<00:02:52.940> see<00:02:53.209> great<00:02:54.170> massive

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
of these things you see great massive

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.890 
of these things you see great massive
lattices<00:02:55.220> of<00:02:55.280> scaffolding<00:02:56.150> all<00:02:56.360> around<00:02:56.750> them

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
lattices of scaffolding all around them

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:57.850 
lattices of scaffolding all around them
all<00:02:57.020> the<00:02:57.050> time<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:57.320> they're<00:02:57.410> horrible<00:02:57.739> I

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
all the time and they're horrible I

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.070 
all the time and they're horrible I
sauce<00:02:58.160> but<00:02:58.790> they<00:02:58.910> need<00:02:59.120> to<00:02:59.150> be<00:02:59.300> there<00:02:59.720> so<00:03:00.050> that

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
sauce but they need to be there so that

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.630 
sauce but they need to be there so that
people<00:03:00.380> can<00:03:00.500> repair<00:03:00.830> and<00:03:01.040> reinforce<00:03:01.459> the

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
people can repair and reinforce the

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.040 
people can repair and reinforce the
building's<00:03:01.970> to<00:03:02.120> stop<00:03:02.300> them<00:03:02.450> from<00:03:02.510> collapsing

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
building's to stop them from collapsing

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.710 
building's to stop them from collapsing
right<00:03:03.680> so<00:03:04.010> that's<00:03:04.700> quite<00:03:04.880> a<00:03:05.000> common<00:03:05.360> sight<00:03:05.540> you

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
right so that's quite a common sight you

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.870 
right so that's quite a common sight you
see<00:03:05.870> all<00:03:05.989> this<00:03:06.080> scaffolding<00:03:06.620> around<00:03:06.980> all

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
see all this scaffolding around all

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.640 
see all this scaffolding around all
these<00:03:08.060> old<00:03:08.120> structures<00:03:09.080> and<00:03:09.260> things<00:03:09.440> and

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
these old structures and things and

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.050 
these old structures and things and
that's<00:03:10.070> what<00:03:10.190> they've<00:03:10.310> kind<00:03:10.550> of<00:03:10.640> done<00:03:10.790> here

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
that's what they've kind of done here

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.390 
that's what they've kind of done here
the<00:03:11.300> the<00:03:11.810> idea<00:03:12.110> obviously<00:03:12.260> is<00:03:12.709> the<00:03:13.040> underneath

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
the the idea obviously is the underneath

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.590 
the the idea obviously is the underneath
Crofts<00:03:13.730> manner<00:03:13.940> you've<00:03:14.150> got<00:03:14.270> this<00:03:14.360> huge

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
Crofts manner you've got this huge

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.780 
Crofts manner you've got this huge
massive<00:03:15.080> place<00:03:15.620> this<00:03:15.860> old<00:03:16.040> crypt<00:03:16.400> right<00:03:16.489> there

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
massive place this old crypt right there

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.449 
massive place this old crypt right there
look<00:03:16.940> not<00:03:17.120> even<00:03:17.299> Lara<00:03:17.480> knew<00:03:17.660> about<00:03:18.220> very<00:03:19.220> very

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
look not even Lara knew about very very

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.910 
look not even Lara knew about very very
ancient<00:03:19.670> site<00:03:20.090> but<00:03:20.480> obviously<00:03:21.470> her<00:03:21.680> father

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
ancient site but obviously her father

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.410 
ancient site but obviously her father
had<00:03:22.100> been<00:03:22.250> tending<00:03:22.610> to<00:03:22.730> it<00:03:22.850> so<00:03:23.000> we've<00:03:23.120> got<00:03:23.239> like

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
had been tending to it so we've got like

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.360 
had been tending to it so we've got like
actual<00:03:24.049> electric<00:03:24.470> lights<00:03:24.739> and<00:03:24.920> stuff<00:03:25.160> going

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
actual electric lights and stuff going

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.590 
actual electric lights and stuff going
through<00:03:25.640> and<00:03:25.760> it's<00:03:25.880> a<00:03:25.970> really<00:03:26.150> cool<00:03:26.299> blend

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
through and it's a really cool blend

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.240 
through and it's a really cool blend
that<00:03:26.840> they've<00:03:27.320> got<00:03:27.500> there<00:03:27.709> with<00:03:27.890> this

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
that they've got there with this

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.860 
that they've got there with this
actually<00:03:28.610> like<00:03:28.790> being<00:03:29.000> powered<00:03:29.450> in<00:03:29.570> this<00:03:29.720> way

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
actually like being powered in this way

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.390 
actually like being powered in this way
it's<00:03:30.410> actually<00:03:30.680> one<00:03:30.920> of<00:03:30.950> the<00:03:31.040> most<00:03:31.220> unique

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
it's actually one of the most unique

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.949 
it's actually one of the most unique
teams<00:03:31.760> I<00:03:31.910> think<00:03:31.940> they've<00:03:32.299> ever<00:03:32.420> done<00:03:32.540> in<00:03:32.810> Tomb

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
teams I think they've ever done in Tomb

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.539 
teams I think they've ever done in Tomb
Raider<00:03:33.049> just<00:03:33.440> because<00:03:33.680> of<00:03:33.799> that<00:03:33.830> story<00:03:34.340> and

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
Raider just because of that story and

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.580 
Raider just because of that story and
backstory<00:03:35.000> to<00:03:35.090> it<00:03:35.269> there's<00:03:35.690> not<00:03:35.870> most<00:03:36.440> of<00:03:36.530> the

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
backstory to it there's not most of the

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.110 
backstory to it there's not most of the
time<00:03:36.739> the<00:03:36.920> ancient<00:03:37.280> places<00:03:37.430> you<00:03:37.640> go<00:03:37.760> to<00:03:37.820> are

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
time the ancient places you go to are

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.640 
time the ancient places you go to are
untouched<00:03:38.630> for<00:03:38.900> years<00:03:39.080> and<00:03:39.200> years<00:03:39.260> and<00:03:39.500> years

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
untouched for years and years and years

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.320 
untouched for years and years and years
but<00:03:39.709> this<00:03:39.980> one<00:03:40.190> isn't<00:03:40.370> untouched<00:03:40.910> it's

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
but this one isn't untouched it's

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.460 
but this one isn't untouched it's
interesting<00:03:41.510> so<00:03:41.900> you've<00:03:42.049> got<00:03:42.079> the<00:03:42.260> bars

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
interesting so you've got the bars

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:43.780 
interesting so you've got the bars
coming<00:03:42.799> out<00:03:42.890> and<00:03:43.100> what<00:03:43.340> I<00:03:43.400> liked<00:03:43.640> in

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
coming out and what I liked in

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.190 
coming out and what I liked in
particular<00:03:44.060> anyway<00:03:44.540> was<00:03:44.720> the<00:03:44.959> the

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
particular anyway was the the

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.420 
particular anyway was the the
scaffolding<00:03:45.709> because<00:03:45.920> that's<00:03:46.100> something<00:03:46.220> you

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
scaffolding because that's something you

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.370 
scaffolding because that's something you
see<00:03:46.579> a<00:03:46.610> lot<00:03:46.820> in<00:03:47.060> in<00:03:47.390> in<00:03:47.660> real<00:03:47.810> life<00:03:48.019> and<00:03:48.230> it's

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
see a lot in in in real life and it's

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.420 
see a lot in in in real life and it's
like<00:03:48.530> they've<00:03:48.680> actually<00:03:48.829> gone<00:03:49.040> and<00:03:49.190> put<00:03:49.310> it

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
like they've actually gone and put it

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.460 
like they've actually gone and put it
there<00:03:49.549> it's<00:03:50.060> cool<00:03:50.269> it's<00:03:50.690> cool<00:03:50.930> i<00:03:51.049> like<00:03:51.260> it

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
there it's cool it's cool i like it

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.650 
there it's cool it's cool i like it
anyway<00:03:52.130> so<00:03:52.940> now<00:03:53.000> we<00:03:53.090> get<00:03:53.239> into<00:03:53.269> the<00:03:53.450> second

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
anyway so now we get into the second

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.569 
anyway so now we get into the second
half<00:03:53.690> of<00:03:53.810> the<00:03:53.930> room<00:03:54.019> and<00:03:54.170> can<00:03:55.130> be<00:03:55.310> a<00:03:55.340> bit

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
half of the room and can be a bit

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:57.039 
half of the room and can be a bit
complicated<00:03:55.730> i<00:03:56.209> suppose<00:03:56.510> but<00:03:56.720> i'll<00:03:56.810> try<00:03:56.959> and

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
complicated i suppose but i'll try and

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:58.539 
complicated i suppose but i'll try and
explain<00:03:57.230> it<00:03:57.380> as<00:03:57.470> best<00:03:57.500> I<00:03:57.709> can<00:03:57.829> there's<00:03:58.280> a<00:03:58.340> pole

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
explain it as best I can there's a pole

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:00.670 
explain it as best I can there's a pole
up<00:03:58.760> here<00:03:58.970> which<00:03:59.150> you<00:03:59.209> can<00:03:59.329> pull<00:03:59.510> out<00:03:59.660> this<00:04:00.530> is

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
up here which you can pull out this is

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.380 
up here which you can pull out this is
for<00:04:00.829> nothing<00:04:01.040> except<00:04:01.610> a<00:04:01.700> secret<00:04:02.090> which<00:04:02.269> I'll

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
for nothing except a secret which I'll

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.240 
for nothing except a secret which I'll
go<00:04:02.540> and<00:04:02.630> get<00:04:02.750> now<00:04:02.930> at<00:04:03.709> the<00:04:03.860> end<00:04:04.010> on<00:04:04.130> the<00:04:04.220> right

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
go and get now at the end on the right

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.710 
go and get now at the end on the right

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
will wonder like the thing is when I

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.770 
will wonder like the thing is when I
when<00:05:25.039> I<00:05:25.070> started<00:05:25.310> replaying<00:05:25.669> this<00:05:25.820> for<00:05:26.479> the<00:05:26.570> LP

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
when I started replaying this for the LP

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.120 
when I started replaying this for the LP
I<00:05:26.960> was<00:05:27.050> like<00:05:27.199> oh<00:05:27.320> I<00:05:27.380> can't<00:05:27.590> remember<00:05:27.800> any<00:05:28.039> of

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
I was like oh I can't remember any of

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.439 
I was like oh I can't remember any of
the<00:05:28.280> retina<00:05:28.580> relic<00:05:28.849> so<00:05:28.940> I<00:05:28.970> can<00:05:29.120> only<00:05:29.240> remember

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:29.449 
the retina relic so I can only remember

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:30.760 
the retina relic so I can only remember
like<00:05:29.690> one<00:05:29.870> or<00:05:29.960> two<00:05:29.990> relics<00:05:30.380> in<00:05:30.440> the<00:05:30.500> entire

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
like one or two relics in the entire

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.460 
like one or two relics in the entire
game<00:05:31.070> and<00:05:31.250> I<00:05:32.000> realized<00:05:32.599> while<00:05:32.960> I<00:05:32.990> was<00:05:33.139> playing

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
game and I realized while I was playing

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.950 
game and I realized while I was playing
through<00:05:33.680> this<00:05:34.220> on<00:05:34.490> the<00:05:34.580> test<00:05:34.789> play<00:05:35.030> that<00:05:35.630> is

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
through this on the test play that is

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.529 
through this on the test play that is
because<00:05:36.770> the<00:05:36.949> relics<00:05:37.610> are<00:05:37.669> so<00:05:37.820> crap<00:05:38.180> in<00:05:38.389> this

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:38.539 
because the relics are so crap in this

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:42.040 
because the relics are so crap in this
game<00:05:38.750> that<00:05:39.430> they<00:05:40.430> obviously<00:05:40.639> just<00:05:41.150> litter<00:05:41.810> the

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
game that they obviously just litter the

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.360 
game that they obviously just litter the
relics<00:05:42.349> around<00:05:42.620> variety<00:05:43.010> and<00:05:43.099> they<00:05:43.190> were<00:05:43.250> like

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
relics around variety and they were like

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.980 
relics around variety and they were like
shit<00:05:43.610> we've<00:05:43.760> forgotten<00:05:44.000> to<00:05:44.120> put<00:05:44.270> secrets<00:05:44.870> in

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
shit we've forgotten to put secrets in

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.360 
shit we've forgotten to put secrets in
let's<00:05:45.199> just<00:05:45.380> throw<00:05:45.470> them<00:05:45.620> around<00:05:45.740> and<00:05:46.039> the

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
let's just throw them around and the

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.250 
let's just throw them around and the
relics<00:05:46.729> have<00:05:47.030> not<00:05:47.449> had<00:05:47.659> much<00:05:47.870> thought<00:05:48.199> that

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
relics have not had much thought that

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.529 
relics have not had much thought that
this<00:05:48.620> relic<00:05:49.159> could<00:05:49.340> be<00:05:49.490> a<00:05:49.520> bronze<00:05:49.940> I'm<00:05:50.240> telling

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:50.539 
this relic could be a bronze I'm telling

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:52.390 
this relic could be a bronze I'm telling
you<00:05:50.659> honestly<00:05:50.840> if<00:05:51.500> this<00:05:51.650> is<00:05:51.770> a<00:05:51.800> tomb<00:05:51.949> raider

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
you honestly if this is a tomb raider

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.279 
you honestly if this is a tomb raider
legend<00:05:52.820> and<00:05:53.030> this<00:05:53.479> would<00:05:53.659> be<00:05:53.750> a<00:05:53.780> bronze<00:05:54.020> it

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:54.289 
legend and this would be a bronze it

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:56.290 
legend and this would be a bronze it
definitely<00:05:54.949> would<00:05:55.099> be<00:05:55.130> a<00:05:55.220> broad<00:05:55.430> anyway<00:05:55.909> right

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
definitely would be a broad anyway right

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.689 
definitely would be a broad anyway right
so<00:05:56.449> around<00:05:56.750> this<00:05:56.900> half<00:05:57.320> of<00:05:57.409> the<00:05:57.470> room<00:05:57.699> we've

00:05:58.689 --> 00:05:58.699 
so around this half of the room we've

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:00.370 
so around this half of the room we've
got<00:05:58.820> some<00:05:58.970> stuff<00:05:59.180> to<00:05:59.210> fill<00:05:59.449> it<00:05:59.570> with<00:05:59.690> we've<00:06:00.110> got

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
got some stuff to fill it with we've got

got some stuff to fill it with we've got
a<00:06:00.680> wig<00:06:01.220> pole<00:06:01.460> that<00:06:01.669> we<00:06:01.759> can<00:06:01.909> spin<00:06:02.150> and<00:06:03.639> when

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 
a wig pole that we can spin and when

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:05.950 
a wig pole that we can spin and when
Lara<00:06:04.820> stops<00:06:05.060> trying<00:06:05.210> to<00:06:05.330> kick<00:06:05.449> things<00:06:05.630> I<00:06:05.900> know

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:09.889 
you go we got a weird pole which we can

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:12.129 
you go we got a weird pole which we can
try<00:06:10.009> to<00:06:10.070> move<00:06:10.599> not<00:06:11.599> much<00:06:11.720> seems<00:06:11.840> to<00:06:12.020> happen

there's<00:06:12.470> a<00:06:12.530> gate<00:06:12.740> thing<00:06:13.130> up<00:06:13.250> there<00:06:13.280> that's

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
there's a gate thing up there that's

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.310 
there's a gate thing up there that's
trying<00:06:13.849> to<00:06:13.880> open<00:06:14.090> pits<00:06:14.300> blocked<00:06:14.659> by<00:06:15.050> something

so<00:06:15.620> we<00:06:16.430> need<00:06:16.580> to<00:06:16.669> figure<00:06:16.820> that<00:06:16.970> out<00:06:17.030> also<00:06:17.690> you

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:17.780 
so we need to figure that out also you

so we need to figure that out also you
notice<00:06:17.930> I'm<00:06:18.139> fiddling<00:06:18.440> with<00:06:18.530> this<00:06:18.680> and

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:18.919 
notice I'm fiddling with this and

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:35.419 
these levers which I'm not gonna

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:37.540 
these levers which I'm not gonna
actually<00:06:35.690> spin<00:06:36.110> to<00:06:36.560> tell<00:06:37.039> you<00:06:37.219> what<00:06:37.370> they<00:06:37.490> do

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:41.260 
though they use this but what they'll do
is<00:06:40.760> spin<00:06:40.969> those

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:41.270 
is spin those

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.480 
is spin those
on<00:06:41.570> top<00:06:41.720> of<00:06:41.750> this<00:06:41.960> central<00:06:42.500> thing<00:06:42.680> so<00:06:42.980> right

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:43.490 
on top of this central thing so right

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:44.770 
on top of this central thing so right
now<00:06:43.520> we've<00:06:43.760> got<00:06:43.790> loads<00:06:44.000> of<00:06:44.090> machinery<00:06:44.480> but<00:06:44.690> we

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:44.780 
now we've got loads of machinery but we

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.270 
now we've got loads of machinery but we
don't<00:06:44.990> know<00:06:45.080> what<00:06:45.230> to<00:06:45.350> do<00:06:45.470> it<00:06:45.590> or<00:06:45.830> how<00:06:45.950> it<00:06:46.100> works

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.280 
don't know what to do it or how it works

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.980 
don't know what to do it or how it works
we've<00:06:46.730> got<00:06:46.850> these<00:06:46.970> pieces<00:06:47.210> to<00:06:47.420> the<00:06:47.510> puzzle<00:06:47.630> but

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:47.990 
we've got these pieces to the puzzle but

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:49.900 
we've got these pieces to the puzzle but
it's<00:06:48.110> not<00:06:48.440> coming<00:06:48.590> together<00:06:48.740> right<00:06:49.430> now<00:06:49.610> we've

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:49.910 
it's not coming together right now we've

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.280 
it's not coming together right now we've
got<00:06:49.940> these<00:06:50.090> side<00:06:50.270> passages<00:06:50.690> up<00:06:50.900> there<00:06:51.080> takes

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:51.290 
got these side passages up there takes

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:52.600 
got these side passages up there takes
you<00:06:51.410> to<00:06:51.500> the<00:06:51.560> balcony<00:06:51.710> again<00:06:52.100> it's<00:06:52.370> a<00:06:52.400> mirror

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:52.610 
you to the balcony again it's a mirror

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:53.830 
you to the balcony again it's a mirror
image<00:06:52.700> over<00:06:52.940> on<00:06:53.060> the<00:06:53.120> other<00:06:53.150> side<00:06:53.300> because

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 
image over on the other side because

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.570 
image over on the other side because
these<00:06:54.080> blocks<00:06:54.380> dropped<00:06:54.890> around<00:06:55.040> all<00:06:55.340> over<00:06:55.370> the

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:55.580 
these blocks dropped around all over the

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.700 
these blocks dropped around all over the
place<00:06:55.640> and<00:06:55.970> we've<00:06:56.870> got<00:06:57.110> if<00:06:57.260> we<00:06:57.350> come<00:06:57.500> to<00:06:57.620> the

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:57.710 
place and we've got if we come to the

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.250 
place and we've got if we come to the
end<00:06:57.740> of<00:06:57.950> these<00:06:58.070> passages<00:06:58.580> a<00:06:59.050> pressure<00:07:00.050> plate

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:00.260 
end of these passages a pressure plate

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.160 
end of these passages a pressure plate
which<00:07:00.920> opens<00:07:01.280> these<00:07:01.460> gates<00:07:01.790> that<00:07:02.630> we<00:07:02.720> saw<00:07:02.870> open

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:03.170 
which opens these gates that we saw open

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:04.660 
which opens these gates that we saw open
before<00:07:03.440> on<00:07:03.620> the<00:07:03.710> original<00:07:04.130> pleasure<00:07:04.340> pressure

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:04.670 
before on the original pleasure pressure

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.180 
before on the original pleasure pressure
plate<00:07:04.910> that<00:07:05.030> we've<00:07:05.150> stood<00:07:05.330> on<00:07:05.480> okay<00:07:06.080> so<00:07:06.590> here's

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:07.190 
plate that we've stood on okay so here's

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:08.950 
plate that we've stood on okay so here's
the<00:07:07.310> idea<00:07:07.340> what<00:07:07.880> we<00:07:08.030> want<00:07:08.300> as<00:07:08.480> you<00:07:08.780> might<00:07:08.900> have

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 
the idea what we want as you might have

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.020 
the idea what we want as you might have
guessed<00:07:09.080> is<00:07:09.620> to<00:07:09.890> be<00:07:10.190> on<00:07:10.310> that<00:07:10.430> pressure<00:07:10.730> plate

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:11.030 
guessed is to be on that pressure plate

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:15.160 
guessed is to be on that pressure plate
so<00:07:11.690> that<00:07:11.720> light<00:07:12.380> appear<00:07:12.890> in<00:07:13.160> there<00:07:13.640> but<00:07:14.360> we<00:07:14.990> can

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:15.170 
so that light appear in there but we can

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:16.750 
so that light appear in there but we can
also<00:07:15.290> be<00:07:15.560> in<00:07:15.710> that<00:07:15.830> half<00:07:16.070> of<00:07:16.190> the<00:07:16.340> room<00:07:16.460> so

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:16.760 
also be in that half of the room so

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.670 
also be in that half of the room so
that's<00:07:17.000> where<00:07:17.180> the<00:07:17.240> blocks<00:07:17.480> come<00:07:17.750> in<00:07:17.930> it's

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:18.680 
that's where the blocks come in it's

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.220 
that's where the blocks come in it's
actually<00:07:18.980> very<00:07:19.010> very<00:07:19.400> very<00:07:19.940> simple<00:07:20.450> and<00:07:20.570> so

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:21.230 
actually very very very simple and so

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:22.960 
actually very very very simple and so
we're<00:07:21.560> gonna<00:07:21.680> have<00:07:21.800> to<00:07:21.890> do<00:07:22.010> a<00:07:22.040> lot<00:07:22.340> of<00:07:22.400> this<00:07:22.610> is

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:22.970 
we're gonna have to do a lot of this is

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:24.100 
we're gonna have to do a lot of this is
just<00:07:23.270> gonna<00:07:23.330> be<00:07:23.510> me<00:07:23.660> running<00:07:23.870> around<00:07:23.900> with

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:24.110 
just gonna be me running around with

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.690 
just gonna be me running around with
blocks<00:07:24.410> because<00:07:24.620> Lara<00:07:24.890> move<00:07:25.130> so<00:07:25.280> slowly<00:07:25.520> by

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:25.700 
blocks because Lara move so slowly by

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.610 
blocks because Lara move so slowly by
the<00:07:25.760> way<00:07:25.960> hopefully<00:07:26.960> you<00:07:27.170> can<00:07:27.260> just<00:07:27.440> bear<00:07:27.590> with

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:27.620 
the way hopefully you can just bear with

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.710 
the way hopefully you can just bear with
that<00:07:27.890> again<00:07:28.670> it's<00:07:28.820> the<00:07:28.940> same<00:07:29.120> deal<00:07:29.330> down<00:07:29.510> here

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:29.720 
that again it's the same deal down here

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.060 
that again it's the same deal down here
loads<00:07:29.990> of<00:07:30.080> spiders<00:07:31.960> just<00:07:32.960> kill<00:07:33.620> like<00:07:33.860> that

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:34.070 
loads of spiders just kill like that

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:35.760 
loads of spiders just kill like that
it's<00:07:34.550> the<00:07:34.640> same<00:07:34.820> deal<00:07:35.030> you<00:07:35.180> just<00:07:35.270> got<00:07:35.450> another

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:35.770 
it's the same deal you just got another

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.200 
it's the same deal you just got another
pressure<00:07:36.770> plate<00:07:37.040> here<00:07:37.280> that<00:07:37.760> takes<00:07:37.970> you<00:07:38.090> back

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:38.210 
pressure plate here that takes you back

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:39.460 
pressure plate here that takes you back
out<00:07:38.390> it's<00:07:38.570> just<00:07:38.690> the<00:07:38.750> opposite<00:07:38.990> side<00:07:39.110> you<00:07:39.350> can

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:39.470 
out it's just the opposite side you can

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:41.410 
out it's just the opposite side you can
actually<00:07:39.590> ignore<00:07:39.980> this<00:07:40.250> this<00:07:40.610> corridor<00:07:41.210> if

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:41.420 
actually ignore this this corridor if

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.090 
actually ignore this this corridor if
you<00:07:41.510> want<00:07:41.690> you<00:07:41.870> really<00:07:42.110> can<00:07:42.290> but<00:07:42.950> there's<00:07:43.070> a

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:43.100 
you want you really can but there's a

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.090 
you want you really can but there's a
rocket<00:07:43.400> so<00:07:43.580> grab<00:07:43.850> the<00:07:43.940> book
