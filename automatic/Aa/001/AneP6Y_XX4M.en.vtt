00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello everyone today in parallel with 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.020
 DVRs would like to start 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.480
 overview and staff head 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.110
 gps multimedia devices 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.839
 navigation systems today will 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.710
 disassemble a small incident toyota prado 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.369
 150 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.810
 a man came to me asking 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.789
 install exactly head unit 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.619
 the navigation system I agreed 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.750
 since usually it is not particularly difficult 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.369
 is up 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.940
 when I became a car I saw this 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.940
 radio cassette player 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.530
 turning it on 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:53.220
 the main menu will come out and see the standard 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:57.620
 feature set this menu 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:01:00.390
 9 ipod iphone settings menu 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.239
 sd gps map 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.780
 which was also duplicated by a button on 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.060
 the panel itself and here I was alerted 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.260
 when I began to look at myself in detail 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.020
 radio panel 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.930
 I saw her two micro holes 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.960
 sd card right hole was with slot 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:23.100
 under sd micro sd card and signed sd 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.899
 card left slot I just did not find there 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.810
 there was a stub going to nothing 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:31.970
 signed upon learning that this person 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.920
 is the owner of the installation center 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.350
 I asked him to remove the mantle you bring 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.070
 its me because I understood that special 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.380
 he will have no work and already in the department 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:48.560
 see her completely poyuzat already 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:51.990
 thoroughly when he failed and brought 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.600
 it turned out that the radio is completely but he 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.740
 and has no name not brand 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.740
 nothing but a serial number 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.550
 connecting and and start exploring i'm 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:04.950
 understood that 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.929
 The sd slot is only for 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.870
 multimedia i mean 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:15.720
 this video audio files are kind there 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.400
 jpeg pictures and so on then 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.080
 the navigation system he is absolutely not 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.430
 undermines 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:25.140
 then I had to make out that I 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:29.090
 to make sure you are right 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:33.830
 her getting to the sd card slot 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.830
 here it looks like that from the back side 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.770
 eesti 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:51.270
 I spread to another part of the radio 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:54.110
 Where there should be a gps slot in general, everything 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:57.170
 this case looks like this 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:00.530
 you were picking up my pain on want principle 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.200
 watered passions giving out for medicine these 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.960
 thousands of price up to many things so therefore became 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.810
 price tag and it seems on this smoke for all and 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:12.110
 typed fight me like you want prezzi 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.750
 my passion war during you 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.690
 see 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.910
 4 pin on the flesh coming to the hole there 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.100
 where there should be a slot but with the lot itself 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.050
 they don't end and give the chinese 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.390
 the change ended simply did not have time 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:30.320
 put this slot put the stub and 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:34.489
 said that it should be that 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:40.550
 amazing what is essentially ready for it 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:43.270
 has gps module gps antenna option gps 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.680
 It has no slot for a card sd 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.330
 really visible talking about China 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.660
 such a country that is chosen even 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.730
 fakes fake but i won't stop 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.650
 what has been achieved is not just interesting 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:04:01.340
 what 's the menthol from where 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:02.769
 legs grow after studying externally I once again 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.030
 paid attention to the serial number 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:08.209
 it began with two letters 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.910
 almost further 6400 some more letters and 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.959
 then again some numbers 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.269
 accordingly, I needed it exactly 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.720
 first letters with tyrant numbers like 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:19.549
 rule on any machine 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.400
 it means lineup 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:25.640
 and then I remembered that once already 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:29.150
 faced with similar markings almost 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:31.160
 this is a chinese hit company accordingly 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.220
 6320 and this is the lineup 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:38.030
 the radio itself got on the internet all 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:41.229
 I did find what I was looking for here 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.229
 looks like this 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:02.060
 as you see the tape recorder is the same with 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:04.970
 One thing and the difference that the elephant gps maps 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:08.530
 he is still signed and has a place there 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:10.790
 actually be on the reverse side 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.780
 This radio has no 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:18.320
 auxiliary outputs except linear 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:21.050
 inputs and outputs no blocks 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.330
 connect anything so choose 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:28.480
 receiver be extremely careful 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.480
 vigilant everyone thanks
