00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:32.039
 and what life has 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:39.160
 He left from where he was his second home 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:42.380
 from the municipal town hall of olocuilta 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.260
 where he gave his biggest effort to more 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:48.350
 of 1,000 older adults which gave 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.340
 sweetheart where the heart of each 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.340
 one of them 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.390
 winner of a thousand battles 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:05.010
 Y 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.010
 a true warrior 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.870
 this human being 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:26.640
 I take off my hat and sounds 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.640
 although it has no force 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:33.570
 and the sound 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.570
 although I had nothing 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.640
 burning letting know 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.939
 my feeling 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.740
 we already know although everything has a force 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:04.300
 and clean words 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:08.130
 sounds in the wind 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.130
 from knowing so much 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.800
 Peppers 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:20.140
 and although you are in a better life 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:25.140
 one 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.140
 I had a flame today to rest 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:37.870
 but your memory never 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.870
 and from my life will be erased 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:47.610
 and telling our Lord that he has 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:50.129
 left faithful are footprints in lives 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:54.209
 of each one of us he has 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:57.170
 left in our hearts entered that 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:00.090
 love that God gave him to follow me 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:04.140
 we would go and see how we would like 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:07.739
 our grave as we wanted our 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.049
 tender process asked him what 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:15.650

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:18.569
 stations remembered clear things and 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.540
 I also want to say that we have spoken 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.360
 with the 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:27.170
 of all the work that the brothers of the 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:29.680
 way they did not rescue him love 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.530

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.379

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.450
 I had all the people who worked with him 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:41.390
 in that part 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.209
 about 45 years ago came to 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.640

 they had grown too 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:59.590
 and we thought he was going to fulfill a 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:02.260
 space make that a success 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.800
