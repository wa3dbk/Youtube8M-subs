that you can set it shut away so

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.059 
that you can set it shut away so
basically<00:03:00.700> it's<00:03:00.880> just<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.750> Wi-Fi<00:03:02.140> method<00:03:02.530> but

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
basically it's just the Wi-Fi method but

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:04.470 
basically it's just the Wi-Fi method but
it's<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.280> same<00:03:03.459> as<00:03:03.640> the<00:03:03.790> ethernet<00:03:04.209> kind<00:03:04.390> of<00:03:04.450> a

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
it's the same as the ethernet kind of a

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.030 
it's the same as the ethernet kind of a
method<00:03:04.810> but<00:03:04.959> obviously<00:03:05.500> each<00:03:05.680> tech<00:03:05.950> the

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
method but obviously each tech the

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.559 
method but obviously each tech the
ethernet<00:03:06.370> cable<00:03:06.670> a<00:03:06.760> this<00:03:07.269> one<00:03:07.450> you<00:03:07.540> just

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
ethernet cable a this one you just

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.040 
ethernet cable a this one you just
simply<00:03:07.870> sign<00:03:08.200> out<00:03:08.440> so<00:03:08.739> i<00:03:09.540> suppose<00:03:10.540> even<00:03:10.870> the

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
simply sign out so i suppose even the

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.930 
simply sign out so i suppose even the
cable<00:03:11.350> you<00:03:11.470> just<00:03:11.739> can<00:03:11.920> use<00:03:12.160> this<00:03:12.340> as<00:03:12.550> well<00:03:12.700> so

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
cable you just can use this as well so

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.840 
cable you just can use this as well so
