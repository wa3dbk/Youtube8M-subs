basically light up everything in front

removed<00:02:13.250> one<00:02:14.180> thing<00:02:14.329> is<00:02:14.450> kind<00:02:14.629> of<00:02:14.689> neat<00:02:14.780> about

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
removed one thing is kind of neat about

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.730 
removed one thing is kind of neat about
it<00:02:15.049> is

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
it is

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.440 
it is
you<00:02:15.800> can<00:02:15.980> actually<00:02:16.190> use<00:02:16.400> this<00:02:16.700> as<00:02:16.880> a<00:02:16.910> candle<00:02:17.330> I

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
you can actually use this as a candle I

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.210 
you can actually use this as a candle I
wouldn't<00:02:17.990> really<00:02:18.080> recommend<00:02:18.170> it<00:02:18.710> if<00:02:18.890> you're

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
wouldn't really recommend it if you're

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.740 
wouldn't really recommend it if you're
in<00:02:19.460> a<00:02:19.520> situation<00:02:19.550> where<00:02:20.120> you<00:02:20.210> really<00:02:20.240> needed

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
in a situation where you really needed

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.750 
in a situation where you really needed
to<00:02:20.900> use<00:02:21.650> a<00:02:21.680> diffuser<00:02:22.040> or<00:02:22.220> something<00:02:22.610> like<00:02:22.700> that

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
to use a diffuser or something like that

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.600 
to use a diffuser or something like that
instead<00:02:23.240> because<00:02:23.630> you<00:02:23.780> have<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.230> LED<00:02:24.800> exposed

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
instead because you have the LED exposed

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.100 
instead because you have the LED exposed
to<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.880> elements<00:02:26.000> it's<00:02:26.570> not<00:02:26.660> something<00:02:26.870> you

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
to the elements it's not something you

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.630 
to the elements it's not something you
really<00:02:27.140> want<00:02:27.470> to<00:02:27.500> do<00:02:27.650> you<00:02:28.160> don't<00:02:28.280> really<00:02:28.400> want

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
really want to do you don't really want

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.160 
really want to do you don't really want
to<00:02:28.670> scratch<00:02:28.880> that<00:02:29.090> up<00:02:29.240> or<00:02:29.420> damage<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.810> LED<00:02:30.050> in

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
to scratch that up or damage the LED in

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.080 
to scratch that up or damage the LED in
any<00:02:30.290> way<00:02:30.440> but<00:02:30.920> if<00:02:31.160> you<00:02:31.310> really<00:02:31.490> really<00:02:31.700> need<00:02:31.820> to

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
any way but if you really really need to

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.750 
any way but if you really really need to
you<00:02:32.450> do<00:02:32.570> have<00:02:32.720> that<00:02:32.780> option<00:02:36.340> ok<00:02:37.340> let's<00:02:37.580> show

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
you do have that option ok let's show

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.760 
you do have that option ok let's show
you<00:02:37.820> the<00:02:38.060> operation<00:02:38.570> of<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:38.750> light<00:02:38.930> like<00:02:39.680> I

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
you the operation of the light like I

the switch stroke x1 to the left it's

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.580 
the switch stroke x1 to the left it's

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
infinite brightness so if you just tap

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.790 
infinite brightness so if you just tap
it<00:02:58.340> it's<00:02:58.880> going<00:02:59.060> to<00:02:59.120> turn<00:02:59.300> it<00:02:59.450> on<00:02:59.570> and<00:02:59.800> it's

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
just going to stay in that output now if

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.320 
just going to stay in that output now if

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
you tap it and hold it or press it and

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.970 
you tap it and hold it or press it and
hold<00:03:05.450> it<00:03:05.660> it's<00:03:06.320> actually<00:03:06.620> going<00:03:06.740> to<00:03:06.830> ramp

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
hold it it's actually going to ramp

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.710 
hold it it's actually going to ramp
through<00:03:07.160> the<00:03:07.280> different<00:03:07.520> brightnesses<00:03:07.910> now

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
through the different brightnesses now

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.450 
through the different brightnesses now
you're<00:03:09.560> probably<00:03:09.680> not<00:03:09.980> going<00:03:10.070> to<00:03:10.130> notice<00:03:10.310> the

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:10.460 
you're probably not going to notice the

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.220 
you're probably not going to notice the
ramping<00:03:10.790> it<00:03:10.850> at<00:03:10.940> first<00:03:11.090> it's<00:03:11.480> a<00:03:11.630> really<00:03:11.930> really

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
ramping it at first it's a really really

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.530 
ramping it at first it's a really really
slow<00:03:12.590> ramp<00:03:12.860> so<00:03:13.700> it's<00:03:13.820> going<00:03:13.940> to<00:03:14.000> ramp<00:03:14.210> all<00:03:14.420> the

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
slow ramp so it's going to ramp all the

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.940 
slow ramp so it's going to ramp all the
way<00:03:14.660> up<00:03:14.870> and<00:03:15.050> then<00:03:15.380> all<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:15.530> way<00:03:15.650> back<00:03:15.740> down

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
way up and then all the way back down

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.070 
way up and then all the way back down
you'll<00:03:16.460> see<00:03:16.490> a<00:03:16.640> blink<00:03:16.910> like<00:03:17.060> that<00:03:17.300> then<00:03:18.050> it's

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
you'll see a blink like that then it's

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.170 
you'll see a blink like that then it's
going<00:03:18.260> to<00:03:18.350> start<00:03:18.530> going<00:03:18.740> down<00:03:19.010> and<00:03:19.310> when<00:03:20.090> you

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
going to start going down and when you

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.180 
going to start going down and when you
see<00:03:20.330> the<00:03:20.510> output<00:03:20.810> that<00:03:20.990> you<00:03:21.140> want<00:03:21.320> just

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
see the output that you want just

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.620 
see the output that you want just
release<00:03:22.460> it<00:03:22.490> and<00:03:22.790> it'll<00:03:23.030> be<00:03:23.180> set<00:03:23.360> to<00:03:23.390> that

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
release it and it'll be set to that

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.710 
release it and it'll be set to that
until<00:03:24.080> you<00:03:24.170> change<00:03:24.410> it<00:03:24.530> again<00:03:25.330> next<00:03:26.330> one<00:03:26.570> to

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
until you change it again next one to

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.410 
until you change it again next one to
the<00:03:26.810> left<00:03:26.960> as<00:03:27.230> you<00:03:28.070> can<00:03:28.310> see<00:03:28.490> is<00:03:28.730> a<00:03:28.790> super<00:03:29.270> low

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
the left as you can see is a super low

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.380 
the left as you can see is a super low
output<00:03:30.400> there's<00:03:31.400> actually<00:03:31.820> light<00:03:32.000> coming<00:03:32.300> out

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
output there's actually light coming out

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.720 
output there's actually light coming out
of<00:03:32.450> that<00:03:32.540> that's<00:03:33.230> their<00:03:33.530> really<00:03:34.220> low<00:03:34.370> output<00:03:34.550> I

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
of that that's their really low output I

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.090 
of that that's their really low output I
think<00:03:34.910> it's<00:03:35.030> point<00:03:35.300> one<00:03:35.420> lumens<00:03:35.860> for<00:03:36.860> really

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
think it's point one lumens for really

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.860 
think it's point one lumens for really
low<00:03:37.250> light<00:03:37.430> situations<00:03:38.060> saving<00:03:38.480> your<00:03:38.570> battery

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
low light situations saving your battery

anything like that where you don't need
a<00:03:44.870> whole<00:03:44.990> lot<00:03:45.050> of<00:03:45.320> light<00:03:45.470> point<00:03:46.160> well<00:03:46.310> numa's

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
a whole lot of light point well numa's

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.840 
a whole lot of light point well numa's
is<00:03:46.670> perfect<00:03:47.000> for<00:03:47.120> that<00:03:48.580> so<00:03:49.580> that's<00:03:49.730> the

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
is perfect for that so that's the

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.400 
is perfect for that so that's the
operation<00:03:50.360> of<00:03:50.390> the<00:03:50.510> light<00:03:50.690> we're<00:03:51.140> going<00:03:51.230> to<00:03:51.320> go

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
operation of the light we're going to go

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.200 
operation of the light we're going to go
and<00:03:51.560> take<00:03:51.680> this<00:03:51.830> outside<00:03:52.040> and<00:03:52.640> see<00:03:52.940> how<00:03:53.060> it

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.210 
and take this outside and see how it

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.680 
and take this outside and see how it
does<00:03:53.360> up<00:03:53.630> close<00:03:53.930> and<00:03:54.230> at<00:03:54.470> a<00:03:54.500> distance<00:03:55.690> all

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
does up close and at a distance all

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:57.880 
does up close and at a distance all
right<00:03:56.810> we're<00:03:56.960> out<00:03:56.990> here<00:03:57.200> with<00:03:57.350> the<00:03:57.380> scorpion

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
right we're out here with the scorpion

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.500 
right we're out here with the scorpion
and<00:03:58.100> since<00:03:58.430> it's<00:03:58.580> not<00:03:58.700> necessarily<00:03:59.150> made<00:03:59.300> for

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
and since it's not necessarily made for

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:00.850 
and since it's not necessarily made for
distances<00:03:59.870> but<00:04:00.050> it<00:04:00.170> actually<00:04:00.290> does<00:04:00.590> pretty

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
distances but it actually does pretty

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.440 
distances but it actually does pretty
well<00:04:00.950> at<00:04:01.130> distances<00:04:01.550> we're<00:04:02.210> going<00:04:02.300> to<00:04:02.390> be

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
well at distances we're going to be

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.360 
well at distances we're going to be
doing<00:04:02.570> the<00:04:02.780> up<00:04:02.900> close<00:04:03.080> and<00:04:03.500> the<00:04:04.010> distance

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
doing the up close and the distance

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.130 
doing the up close and the distance
shots<00:04:04.520> with<00:04:04.700> it<00:04:04.850> and<00:04:05.030> comparing<00:04:05.810> it<00:04:05.960> to<00:04:06.020> the

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
shots with it and comparing it to the

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.560 
shots with it and comparing it to the
big<00:04:06.350> 40<00:04:07.070> maglite<00:04:07.520> that<00:04:07.700> I<00:04:07.730> always<00:04:08.000> use<00:04:08.210> so

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
big 40 maglite that I always use so

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.180 
big 40 maglite that I always use so
let's<00:04:08.780> try<00:04:08.900> that<00:04:09.020> mag<00:04:09.170> light<00:04:09.380> off<00:04:09.500> first<00:04:09.710> see

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190

it<00:04:57.430> does<00:04:57.669> different<00:04:58.449> distances<00:04:58.840> and<00:04:58.990> colors

00:04:59.249 --> 00:04:59.259 
it does different distances and colors

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:01.680 
it does different distances and colors
and<00:04:59.440> stuff<00:04:59.789> after<00:05:00.789> their<00:05:00.940> a<00:05:00.969> whole<00:05:01.419> lot<00:05:01.569> of

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
tree in the front yard will zoom in on

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.510 
tree in the front yard will zoom in on
that<00:05:34.860> not<00:05:35.860> that<00:05:35.949> you<00:05:36.099> can<00:05:36.250> actually<00:05:36.370> see

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
that not that you can actually see

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.769 
that not that you can actually see
anything<00:05:36.969> is<00:05:37.120> probably<00:05:37.330> going<00:05:37.449> to<00:05:37.509> just<00:05:37.690> show

00:05:37.769 --> 00:05:37.779 
anything is probably going to just show

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:40.080 
anything is probably going to just show
up<00:05:37.930> as<00:05:38.110> a<00:05:38.139> complete<00:05:38.889> darkness<00:05:39.219> and<00:05:39.610> that's

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
up as a complete darkness and that's

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.180 
up as a complete darkness and that's
pretty<00:05:40.240> much<00:05:40.360> what<00:05:40.630> I<00:05:40.659> see<00:05:40.930> the<00:05:41.199> maglite<00:05:41.680> at

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
pretty much what I see the maglite at

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.159 
pretty much what I see the maglite at
100<00:05:42.550> yards<00:05:42.580> that<00:05:42.940> tree<00:05:43.150> doesn't<00:05:43.779> really<00:05:43.990> do<00:05:44.139> a

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169 
100 yards that tree doesn't really do a

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:45.870 
100 yards that tree doesn't really do a
whole<00:05:44.259> lot<00:05:44.349> so<00:05:44.919> let's<00:05:45.039> try<00:05:45.159> the<00:05:45.219> scorpion<00:05:45.729> out

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
whole lot so let's try the scorpion out

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.850 
whole lot so let's try the scorpion out
this<00:05:46.270> is<00:05:46.419> going<00:05:46.509> to<00:05:46.599> be<00:05:46.690> max<00:05:46.930> output<00:05:47.139> start<00:05:47.740> off

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
this is going to be max output start off

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.879 
this is going to be max output start off
with<00:05:48.039> striate<00:05:48.699> up<00:05:49.469> so<00:05:50.469> you<00:05:50.560> can<00:05:50.650> see<00:05:50.680> a<00:05:50.770> whole

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:50.889 
with striate up so you can see a whole

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:53.219 
with striate up so you can see a whole
lot<00:05:50.919> more<00:05:51.159> light<00:05:51.370> coming<00:05:52.090> out<00:05:52.180> of<00:05:52.240> the<00:05:52.750> of<00:05:53.110> the
