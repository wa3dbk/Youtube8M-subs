00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
 hi and welcome to my channel 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.830
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.390
 I remove makeup every night so 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.220
 it's really very very very important 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.710
 to remove makeup perfectly that is 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.059
 no more trace of makeup and even 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.859
 if we do not wear makeup they have more 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.510
 no trace of dirt pollution 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.369
 because even if we do not realize 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.900
 we have the face super room at the end of 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.359
 the day because we made the kiss to 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.269
 many people we touched the edges of 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.740
 transport it carries a lot of things and 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.359
 then unconsciously this touched to the face 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.430
 and in the face room so that's 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.219
 really pity davie to fold like 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.660
 that with a lot of little dirt is 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.070
 like that there are bacteria that get 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.989
 train so that it allows the buttons to 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.850
 develop and so it really 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.280
 to sleep with the face perfectly 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.860
 own way there I use products 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.110
 100% natural I make myself my 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.090
 cleanser it's super simple and super 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.010
 respectful of the skin I've been doing this since 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.800
 years but frankly I am very 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.140
 satisfied for the makeup remover it is 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.480
 super easy there just needs water 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.040
 oil and in a small container whose 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.479
 which to put the preparation 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.590
 I chose sweet almond oil 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.159
 because it's an oil that's 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:14.189
 really great for nourishing the skin 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.750
 to fix it and this type of small 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.310
 containers so I need some 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.900
 very small thing like that I can 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.350
 change regularly there is no 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.729
 risk that it rhymes so there I use 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.170
 a funnel because I have a huge 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.200
 can but otherwise there is really no 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.060
 need to funnel and I add the oil 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.700
 from above so I advise you to 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.900
 make 50 50 so half half oil 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.140
 so after that it's not necessarily 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.180
 necessary to measure and put the water 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.979
 first and the oil after because 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.810
 him he'll go back up automatically and 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.899
 as many metro or directly if you 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.920
 want a very clean result so to the 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.079
 place of water we can put a 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.630
 hydrosol of our choice of rose water 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.860
 or anything and as I have 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.270
 can really put the oil of our 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.439
 choice 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.630
 so do not hesitate to vary the 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.189
 recipe and I do not know if you have 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.860
 noticed the little tip of the oil of 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.070
 castor to promote the growth of eyelashes 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.070
 and eyebrows 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.450
 it's gone to help make up 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.100
 eyes so I shake well product for 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.530
 to mix the water and the oil I 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.180
 apply on a cotton so I have a 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.200
 trinket alongside we will say the equivalent 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.959
 of a teaspoon 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.290
 I leave a few moments on 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.270
 the eyes and I gently remove so 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.709
 it really removes all makeup there 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.989
 I made a make-up with 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.610
 base mascara eyeshadow 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.470
 underneath and it's for really you 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.239
 prove that his share in but if you 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.100
 have liner and mascara play or 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.860
 something very light that leaves 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:42.010
 very very very very fast again 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.269
 faster than that here so I try 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:49.239
 to be delicate 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:53.500
 I go back to the second phase and others 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:57.340
 cotton you saw the difference between 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.730
 first and third cotton then 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.959
 I apply about two pumps 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.350
 sweet almond oil on the whole 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.350
 my face 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.110
 so that 's going to allow everything to take off 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.970
 the makeup of time so this is the 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.470
 foundation of the corrector of the beam 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.080
 no matter what you put even if you 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.570
 put one thing very light it's 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.670
 really important to take off everything 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.470
 makeup and the makeup remover kind because 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.330
 it's a little bit on the eyes for 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.420
 remove the last residues no I 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.580
 account of African black soap solid and 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.120
 a small brush with very much hair 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.560
 flexible like that but sometimes I do it 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.130
 to the lover frankly I do not take myself 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.730
 the head and I will pass the soap on 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.320
 my face 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.640
 so it's still a little more 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:54.739
 to have the brush but I do not do 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:56.420
 every day I pass a little 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.470
 little on the eyes even if it's not 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.400
 advised but I really want 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.930
 rid of all traces of makeup 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.060
 on the eyes and here I'm going to take a 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.550
 hydrolate so it's witch hazel it's 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.700
 great for little jean buttons 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.200
 lightly applies on the face and 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.640
 I'm applying a little bit again 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.320
 sweet almond oil so the oil 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.390
 of sweet almond that you could see in 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.570
 iron to make my makeup remover 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.880
 biphasic m serves the vile cleanser and m 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.229
 serves as a night cream or by 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.210
 contour of the eye of a kiem serves a 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.690
 little bit to everything but frankly 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.030
 I just love it 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:32.030
 after I like to vary the oils if 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.890
 you have oily skin I you 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.360
 rather advise for example the oil of 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.360
 jojoba which is really great for 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.830
 regulate the sebum of the skin and for 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.800
 avoid the effect g and even if you 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.130
 use another oil like almond 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.979
 fresh 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.810
 olive argan it's not going to grease you the 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:49.760
 skin so do not hesitate to put some 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.380
 the oil on the skin so I insist 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:56.110
 on the outline of the eye I do not hesitate 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.110
 it's 100% natural so I take advantage 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.380
 very consciously but are divided into 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.230
 anyway it's economical 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:09.290
 you had it game it's cheap it takes 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:13.280
 just from source and an oil so that 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:17.810
 costs us nothing is super easy to 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:19.610
 to do it is respectful of the skin that 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.370
 Whether in fact the lice that's all 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:25.070
 type of skin husband thanks with 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.630
 buttons actually it has to be that for 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.450
 breathe do not put creams 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.430
 that contain ingredients that 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.260
 mouth the pores of the skin and had fled 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.850
 with natural things the skin 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.080
 continue to breathe all night so 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.250
 it's very good for skins 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.700
 fat problem you do not need you 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.230
 worry 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.820
 we mean that because you put 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.680
 know him to attack the skin not at 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:46.720
 otherwise it will let the skin breathe 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:49.400
 and breathing it will regulate itself so 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.110
 frankly tried and for the skins 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.970
 dry it feeds well do not hesitate to 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.920
 vary the oils me I showed you 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.670
 like that but I change in a world where 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.250
 I like 

00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:00.530
 olive I like grape seeds 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:04.430
 I like arguing so I do not hesitate 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:05.420
 to change 18 and it's respectful of 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.360
 sensitive eyes 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:10.160
 if you remove makeup 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.570
 makeup removers here you buy in the 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.350
 trade and it burns your eyes 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.450
 it is not normal 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:15.590
 if it wants bruce and one to an aggression 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.240
 who is doing it is necessary 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.850
 react must find other solutions 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.200
 and here is the two-phase makeup remover 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:23.960
 naturalness and luxury at little 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.980
 solutions but if the skin reacts it's 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.630
 that she sends a message must 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.850
 really always respects her and who 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.410
 no suffering on the contrary must 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:33.230
 it's really a moment of relaxation and 

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:35.410
 that it feels good so here I hope 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:38.060
 that you liked 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:39.350
 him the little oil that stay in 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.480
 surface will be absorbed into the 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:42.830
 minutes after you left 

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.420
 for a good night's sleep and the 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.180
 next morning there is really 

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:49.010
 beautiful even well firm well smooth 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.080
 frankly it suits me 100% on the 

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:52.840
 long term and I think even at 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:56.150
 level 2 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.890
 the appearance of wrinkles and so if 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:01.580
 we need to feed pau there is no 

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:03.110
 reason that everything is not going well and 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:06.140
 we do not look poor and my game 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:09.440
 neither firm so I hope it has you 

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:11.270
 please if you like if you like 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.820
 facials things like that 

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:22.940
 do not hesitate to let me know and I 

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:25.150
 will do other faceless videos and and 

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:29.110
 I'll see you soon I kiss you 

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:29.110
 and thanks again for all
