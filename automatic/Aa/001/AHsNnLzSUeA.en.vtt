00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.940
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.300
 Yaroslav bla lighting and 34 edition 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.250
 transfer commandos today in the video I want 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.559
 tell you about what changes 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.509
 worth waiting for everyone's kb 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.910
 new update 097 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.740
 and also solve the issue with the audience in 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.660
 what direction will we develop 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.660
 transmission and so it went 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:34.890
 as we all know team battle is wrong 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.559
 long ago in patch 094 has changed a lot 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.500
 now instead of the usual battles of thought we play 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.020
 on the attack defense and no longer favorite t1 on 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.570
 battlefields as soon as i'm the first time 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.330
 I heard about these changes, I immediately realized 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.620
 that they bring dynamics to the battles 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.690
 since teams will no longer be 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.480
 just sit back in the bushes and 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.820
 play deaf defense and just like that 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.199
 it is now the time has come for the new 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.360
 revolution in kb history 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:05.430
 which I now tell start by 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.590
 the hall is the most important news 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.869
 namely, now in a team battle you can 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.510
 will create their own static commands 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.780
 with personal names and emblems in 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.210
 which can be up to 12 players i 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.369
 I understand that some may say but I 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.320
 after all, and so with my friends I play 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.920
 kobe ​​why do i still have to create your 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.650
 teams 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.930
 but this moment the developers thought out and 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.030
 now when creating a static command 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.670
 you are able to play the so-called 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.890
 laser battles for those who are in the sub 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.690
 explain let's imagine that we 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.580
 We created his team now have 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.040
 it is possible to choose which of 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.900
 battle you will play in the usual battle we 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.610
 get into the classic kb 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.020
 the only difference is now in it 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.690
 can participate not only 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.510
 random team well assembled in advance 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.370
 the word as the developers assure if 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.500
 your static team is missing 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.450
 player then we are able to take into battle 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.700
 legionnaires who can replace 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.610
 missing team member at the time 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.440
 battles but laser battles are already 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.570
 more serious they can take 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.940
 participation exclusively static 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.190
 teams of opponents will be looking for you 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.480
 on the testimony of the statistics of your team 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.060
 it's like she plays 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.910
 they are on the skills of each of the players in 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.190
 eventually you must find action 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.200
 an equal opponent the most important 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.630
 distinctive feature of laser battles 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.120
 it is an opportunity to see which card you are on 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.490
 will get to the beginning of the battle and you will have 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.980
 30 seconds to choose a technique 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.050
 on which you will fight and precisely 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.880
 I personally dreamed about such an opportunity 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.830
 a long time since now for 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.170
 static teams will not be ours 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.120
 universal composition and for each 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.990
 cards have the opportunity to come up with your 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.120
 composition based on who and how to play 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.550
 also when battles laser battles your 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.010
 the team automatically competes in so 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.140
 called global ladder in truth 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.770
 saying I did not quite understand why he 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.540
 need 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.490
 maybe it will be just 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.100
 proof that you are playing 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.590
 the first league of ladar and you are very cool 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.900
 commanders though I personally would not have refused 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.630
 from any buns at the end of the season 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:12.620
 I hope in the first leagues of the rankings 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:15.050
 this will still be in appearance 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.570
 this news, I understand that when you exit 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.220
 patch 097 transfer commandos real 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.320
 can go in two directions 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.020
 first we can also continue to play 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.370
 our universal composition and I continue 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.500
 I will try as often as possible 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.470
 invent and tell you about different 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.830
 tactics for cards in command normal 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.320
 the battle 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.300
 the second option is to create your own 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.750
 teams reclining the idea of ​​universal 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:41.180
 composition and creation of composition and tactics under 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.370
 I will give my opinion to each card 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.350
 I think it's better at the moment 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.830
 keep doing tactics for ordinary 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.690
 battles 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.180
 first left as for me not so 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.760
 and a lot of cards and play with visuals 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.390
 will be much easier in normal battles than in 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.160
 laser 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.440
 and here after we finish with 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.660
 all maps and universal composition 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.970
 already have a real 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.580
 post go to laser kb and start 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.620
 make programs about them, how and from whom we are 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.000
 let's put together a team I say hard I 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.740
 I think most likely it will enter 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.840
 some of my close friends 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.150
 the rest of the seats will be taken by viewers who 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.030
 will want two or three times a week stably 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.860
 play team fight friends on this 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.380
 The moment is my vision is better 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.060
 arrive at the exit of its patch 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.970
 opinion you can leave in the comments 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.190
 I will read it for sure and maybe yours 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:31.840
 a comment will change my mind 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:34.060

 such as they all took the lattice rod 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:24.390
 when we pass we select the remaining 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:28.010
 three or practice and while you do it 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.010

 from one hundred square meters took further refine 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:16.440
