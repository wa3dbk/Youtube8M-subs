I have a lot of blocks to show you guys
so<00:00:10.530> here's<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:12.000> quadrant<00:00:12.660> so<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.440> quadrant

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
so here's the quadrant so the quadrant

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.880 
so here's the quadrant so the quadrant
is<00:00:14.040> really<00:00:14.309> easy<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.730> make<00:00:14.940> you<00:00:15.120> just<00:00:15.299> get<00:00:15.570> this

is really easy to make you just get this

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.450 
is really easy to make you just get this
gray<00:00:16.890> dark<00:00:17.520> gray<00:00:17.869> crate<00:00:18.869> piece<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.590> if<00:00:20.340> you

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
however you want you just put a 2 by 2

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.890 
however you want you just put a 2 by 2
brick<00:00:25.859> in<00:00:26.130> there<00:00:26.480> there<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.570> go<00:00:27.720> as<00:00:27.869> a

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
brick in there there you go as a

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.010 
brick in there there you go as a
quadrant<00:00:30.560> next<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.740> cactus<00:00:32.160> so<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.630> give<00:00:33.809> a

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
quadrant next is a cactus so to give a

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.060 
quadrant next is a cactus so to give a
cactus<00:00:34.559> its

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
cactus its

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.750 
cactus its
spiked<00:00:35.640> enos<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.360> guess<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:37.290> get<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.770> 2<00:00:38.550> by<00:00:38.730> 2

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
spiked enos I guess you get a 2 by 2

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.740 
spiked enos I guess you get a 2 by 2
plate<00:00:39.469> with<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.559> rounded<00:00:41.040> version<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.540> 2<00:00:42.719> by

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
plate with a rounded version and a 2 by

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.940 
plate with a rounded version and a 2 by
2<00:00:42.899> brick<00:00:43.640> and<00:00:44.640> I'm<00:00:45.120> just<00:00:45.270> gonna<00:00:45.590> stack<00:00:46.590> those

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
2 brick and I'm just gonna stack those

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:54.819 
2 brick and I'm just gonna stack those
up<00:00:47.329> over<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.450> over<00:00:49.760> so<00:00:50.760> there's<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.239> cactus

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.049 

next<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.250> sign<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:57.270> I'm<00:00:57.360> going<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.600> get<00:00:57.809> a

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
next is the sign so I'm going to get a

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.340 
next is the sign so I'm going to get a
brown<00:01:00.059> cylinder<00:01:00.960> piece<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:02.210> 2x1<00:01:03.210> my<00:01:03.510> tube<00:01:03.750> brown

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
brown cylinder piece a 2x1 my tube brown

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.250 
brown cylinder piece a 2x1 my tube brown
brick<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.159> I'm<00:01:05.430> gonna<00:01:05.580> put<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.330> circle<00:01:06.840> right

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
brick and I'm gonna put the circle right

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.820 
brick and I'm gonna put the circle right
on<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.830> circle<00:01:08.760> right<00:01:08.880> there

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
on that circle right there

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.859 
on that circle right there
so<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:10.890> gives<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.340> sign<00:01:11.640> effect<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.600> then

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
so I gives it the sign effect and then

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.200 
so I gives it the sign effect and then
I'm<00:01:12.960> going<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.140> put<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> tile<00:01:13.650> on<00:01:13.890> top<00:01:14.000> on<00:01:15.000> my<00:01:15.030> two

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
I'm going to put a tile on top on my two

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.480 
I'm going to put a tile on top on my two
brown<00:01:15.659> tile<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.860> there<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.100> go<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.280> sign<00:01:19.490> put

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
brown tile and there you go a sign put

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.399 
brown tile and there you go a sign put
it<00:01:20.580> right<00:01:20.700> there

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
it right there

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.890 
it right there
so<00:01:22.409> next<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:22.979> torch<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.450> I'm<00:01:24.540> gonna<00:01:24.659> get<00:01:24.869> a

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
so next is the torch so I'm gonna get a

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.660 
so next is the torch so I'm gonna get a
1<00:01:25.200> by<00:01:25.380> 1<00:01:25.409> round<00:01:26.250> brick<00:01:26.869> put<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.930> 1<00:01:28.229> by<00:01:28.259> 1<00:01:28.670> white

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
1 by 1 round brick put a 1 by 1 white

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.730 
1 by 1 round brick put a 1 by 1 white
tile<00:01:30.030> on<00:01:30.299> top<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:31.340> then<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.520> 1<00:01:33.360> by<00:01:33.600> 1<00:01:33.740> orange

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
tile on top and then a 1 by 1 orange

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.109 
tile on top and then a 1 by 1 orange
flat<00:01:35.310> tile<00:01:35.579> on<00:01:35.790> top<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.390> that's<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.720> torch

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
flat tile on top so that's a torch

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.359 
flat tile on top so that's a torch
next<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.420> redstone<00:01:39.869> torch<00:01:40.020> it's<00:01:40.680> this

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
next is the redstone torch it's this

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.460 
next is the redstone torch it's this
basically<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.119> exact<00:01:42.420> same<00:01:42.450> thing<00:01:42.720> but<00:01:43.320> with

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
basically the exact same thing but with

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.800 
basically the exact same thing but with
different<00:01:43.829> colors<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:45.090> I'm<00:01:45.180> going<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.450> get<00:01:45.600> a

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
different colors so I'm going to get a

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.440 
different colors so I'm going to get a
brown<00:01:46.350> 1<00:01:46.860> by<00:01:47.040> 1<00:01:47.220> brick<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:49.490> see-through<00:01:50.490> yellow

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
brown 1 by 1 brick a see-through yellow

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.539 
brown 1 by 1 brick a see-through yellow
and<00:01:51.860> then<00:01:52.860> put<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.540> see-through<00:01:54.540> or<00:01:55.340> I<00:01:56.340> don't

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
and then put a see-through or I don't

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.399 
and then put a see-through or I don't
know<00:01:56.850> what<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.119> would<00:01:57.180> call<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.659> color<00:01:57.869> neon

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
know what you would call that color neon

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.149 
know what you would call that color neon
I<00:01:58.829> guess<00:01:59.040> neon<00:01:59.880> red<00:02:00.180> on<00:02:00.570> top<00:02:00.930> so<00:02:01.680> that's<00:02:01.829> the

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
I guess neon red on top so that's the

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.319 
I guess neon red on top so that's the
redstone<00:02:02.670> torch

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
redstone torch

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.310 
redstone torch
and<00:02:03.530> to<00:02:04.530> put<00:02:04.770> these<00:02:05.090> torches<00:02:06.090> on<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:07.049> side<00:02:07.290> of

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
and to put these torches on the side of

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.790 
and to put these torches on the side of
a<00:02:07.560> wall<00:02:07.590> if<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.160> want<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:09.330> can<00:02:09.509> put<00:02:09.800> get

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
a wall if you want to you can put get

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.920 
a wall if you want to you can put get
this<00:02:11.009> this<00:02:11.640> kind<00:02:11.910> of<00:02:11.970> piece<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.450> make

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
this this kind of piece and make

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
this this kind of piece and make
into<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.170> 2x2<00:02:13.980> with<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.790> tile<00:02:15.000> on<00:02:15.209> top<00:02:15.239> and<00:02:15.950> then

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
into a 2x2 with the tile on top and then

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.420 
into a 2x2 with the tile on top and then
you<00:02:17.129> can<00:02:17.340> put<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:18.510> torch<00:02:19.049> on<00:02:19.290> that<00:02:19.620> so<00:02:20.099> that<00:02:20.310> it

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
you can put the torch on that so that it

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.599 
you can put the torch on that so that it
can<00:02:20.609> be<00:02:20.730> leaning<00:02:21.120> on<00:02:21.239> a<00:02:21.269> wall<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:22.340> if<00:02:23.340> you<00:02:23.430> want

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:23.609 
can be leaning on a wall and if you want

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:26.420 
can be leaning on a wall and if you want
to<00:02:23.730> put<00:02:23.909> it<00:02:24.000> on<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.299> floor<00:02:24.599> like<00:02:25.290> this<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:26.280> can

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
to put it on the floor like this you can

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.959 
to put it on the floor like this you can
just<00:02:26.609> put<00:02:26.819> a<00:02:27.060> stud<00:02:27.870> on<00:02:28.049> the<00:02:28.079> bottom<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:28.969> then

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:29.969 
just put a stud on the bottom and then

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:33.259 
just put a stud on the bottom and then
put<00:02:30.269> it<00:02:30.389> in<00:02:30.480> between<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.989> studs<00:02:32.060> so<00:02:33.060> that's

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
put it in between the studs so that's

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.679 
put it in between the studs so that's
how<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.480> torches<00:02:34.079> work<00:02:34.670> next<00:02:35.670> is<00:02:35.939> the<00:02:36.120> piston

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:36.689 
how the torches work next is the piston

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:39.289 
how the torches work next is the piston
so<00:02:37.230> I'm<00:02:37.319> going<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:37.620> get<00:02:37.769> a<00:02:37.799> 2<00:02:37.980> by<00:02:38.430> 2<00:02:38.459> dark<00:02:39.060> red

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
so I'm going to get a 2 by 2 dark red

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:44.720 
so I'm going to get a 2 by 2 dark red
brick<00:02:39.659> a<00:02:40.760> light<00:02:41.760> gray<00:02:42.510> Lego<00:02:43.139> stud<00:02:43.560> and<00:02:44.430> we're

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
brick a light gray Lego stud and we're

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.960 
brick a light gray Lego stud and we're
gonna<00:02:44.819> put<00:02:45.120> that<00:02:45.150> in<00:02:45.359> the<00:02:45.629> middle<00:02:45.810> of<00:02:46.109> that

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
gonna put that in the middle of that

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.599 
gonna put that in the middle of that
then<00:02:47.970> I'm<00:02:48.090> going<00:02:48.239> to<00:02:48.299> get<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.540> 1<00:02:48.989> by<00:02:49.169> 1<00:02:49.470> dark<00:02:49.799> tan

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
then I'm going to get a 1 by 1 dark tan

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:52.759 
then I'm going to get a 1 by 1 dark tan
piece<00:02:51.000> which<00:02:51.329> it<00:02:51.599> isn't<00:02:51.959> too<00:02:52.139> easy<00:02:52.319> to<00:02:52.530> find

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
piece which it isn't too easy to find

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.159 
piece which it isn't too easy to find
but<00:02:53.310> I<00:02:53.370> got<00:02:53.549> this<00:02:53.730> from<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.030> smallest<00:02:54.540> hobbits

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:55.169 
but I got this from the smallest hobbits

00:02:55.169 --> 00:03:00.170 
but I got this from the smallest hobbits
it<00:02:55.939> now<00:02:56.939> I'm<00:02:57.030> gonna<00:02:57.150> put<00:02:57.419> it<00:02:57.540> on<00:02:57.689> the<00:02:57.930> stud<00:02:59.180> then

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
it now I'm gonna put it on the stud then

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.199 
it now I'm gonna put it on the stud then
we're<00:03:00.359> going<00:03:00.480> to<00:03:00.540> put<00:03:01.049> a<00:03:01.290> 2<00:03:01.829> by<00:03:01.980> 2<00:03:02.010> dark<00:03:02.879> tan

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
we're going to put a 2 by 2 dark tan

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.250 
we're going to put a 2 by 2 dark tan
tile<00:03:03.870> on<00:03:04.109> top<00:03:04.379> for<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.370> piston<00:03:05.909> and<00:03:06.139> there<00:03:07.139> you

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
tile on top for the piston and there you

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.369 
tile on top for the piston and there you
go<00:03:07.379> on<00:03:07.500> activated<00:03:08.129> piston<00:03:08.549> you<00:03:08.700> can<00:03:08.849> put<00:03:09.120> it

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:09.379 
go on activated piston you can put it

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:13.309 
go on activated piston you can put it
facing<00:03:10.379> upwards<00:03:10.829> to<00:03:11.579> the<00:03:11.700> side<00:03:11.939> and<00:03:12.329> if<00:03:12.959> I<00:03:13.079> want

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
facing upwards to the side and if I want

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.619 
facing upwards to the side and if I want
to<00:03:13.469> deactivate<00:03:13.829> the<00:03:14.430> piston<00:03:14.879> I<00:03:15.000> just<00:03:15.209> take<00:03:15.419> out

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629 
to deactivate the piston I just take out

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.800 
to deactivate the piston I just take out
that<00:03:15.889> 1<00:03:16.889> by<00:03:17.069> 1<00:03:17.340> in<00:03:17.609> the<00:03:17.760> Lego<00:03:17.940> stud<00:03:18.359> and<00:03:18.599> just

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
that 1 by 1 in the Lego stud and just

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.680 
that 1 by 1 in the Lego stud and just
put<00:03:19.079> this<00:03:19.319> on<00:03:19.620> top<00:03:19.889> of<00:03:19.949> the<00:03:20.129> brick<00:03:20.519> so<00:03:21.479> that's

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
put this on top of the brick so that's

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.949 
put this on top of the brick so that's
the<00:03:21.810> piston<00:03:22.319> and<00:03:23.030> then<00:03:24.030> last<00:03:24.269> but<00:03:24.389> not<00:03:24.659> least

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
the piston and then last but not least

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.800 
the piston and then last but not least
we<00:03:25.229> have<00:03:25.440> another<00:03:25.889> type<00:03:26.340> of<00:03:26.419> minecart<00:03:27.419> track

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
we have another type of minecart track

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.550 
we have another type of minecart track
it's<00:03:28.319> the<00:03:28.849> activated<00:03:29.849> rail<00:03:30.780> I<00:03:30.810> guess<00:03:31.260> you

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
it's the activated rail I guess you

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.039 
it's the activated rail I guess you
would<00:03:31.709> call<00:03:31.739> it<00:03:32.030> so<00:03:33.030> I'm<00:03:33.120> going<00:03:33.329> to<00:03:33.419> do<00:03:33.900> the

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
would call it so I'm going to do the

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.530 
would call it so I'm going to do the
same<00:03:34.290> thing<00:03:34.560> with<00:03:35.069> these<00:03:35.430> minecart<00:03:36.180> tracks

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
same thing with these minecart tracks

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.250 
same thing with these minecart tracks
I'm<00:03:36.780> going<00:03:36.930> to<00:03:36.989> put<00:03:37.199> the<00:03:37.560> 1<00:03:38.430> by<00:03:38.609> 4<00:03:38.909> Brown<00:03:39.750> tiles

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
I'm going to put the 1 by 4 Brown tiles

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.569 
I'm going to put the 1 by 4 Brown tiles
on<00:03:40.919> there<00:03:41.909> like<00:03:42.060> that<00:03:42.299> and<00:03:42.709> for<00:03:43.709> the<00:03:43.829> activated

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
on there like that and for the activated

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.270 
on there like that and for the activated
rails<00:03:44.849> I'm<00:03:45.209> going<00:03:45.329> to<00:03:45.419> put<00:03:45.599> red<00:03:46.079> jumper<00:03:46.979> plates

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
rails I'm going to put red jumper plates

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.689 
rails I'm going to put red jumper plates
like<00:03:47.939> this<00:03:48.290> on<00:03:49.290> top<00:03:49.769> of<00:03:49.829> the<00:03:50.040> 1<00:03:50.519> by<00:03:50.669> 4<00:03:51.000> plates

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:52.699 
like this on top of the 1 by 4 plates

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:58.429 
like this on top of the 1 by 4 plates
and<00:03:53.900> then<00:03:54.900> I'm<00:03:55.439> gonna<00:03:55.709> get<00:03:56.009> 2<00:03:56.549> yellow<00:03:57.120> 1<00:03:57.959> by<00:03:58.109> 4
