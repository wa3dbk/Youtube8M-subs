what sort of issues we have going on in

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.949 
what sort of issues we have going on in
this<00:02:23.490> particular<00:02:23.819> day<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:24.209> wanted<00:02:24.630> to<00:02:24.690> really

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
this particular day I wanted to really

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.590 
this particular day I wanted to really
boost<00:02:25.140> our<00:02:25.350> immune<00:02:25.560> system<00:02:25.980> so<00:02:26.190> I<00:02:26.220> used<00:02:26.670> closer

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
boost our immune system so I used closer

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.570 
boost our immune system so I used closer
to<00:02:27.870> about<00:02:28.080> eight<00:02:28.319> thousand<00:02:28.860> milligrams<00:02:29.100> but

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
to about eight thousand milligrams but

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.330 
to about eight thousand milligrams but
this<00:02:29.790> is<00:02:29.970> going<00:02:30.270> to<00:02:30.510> make<00:02:30.810> half<00:02:31.350> a<00:02:31.500> gallon<00:02:31.920> so

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
this is going to make half a gallon so

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.330 
this is going to make half a gallon so

you know per serving you're not going to
get<00:02:35.520> that<00:02:35.700> much<00:02:35.970> so<00:02:36.810> I'm<00:02:37.140> just<00:02:37.350> adding<00:02:37.560> all

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
get that much so I'm just adding all

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.600 
get that much so I'm just adding all
these<00:02:38.130> ingredients<00:02:38.340> into<00:02:39.150> my<00:02:39.270> blender<00:02:39.540> and

just pour all those together and then
the<00:02:43.110> next<00:02:43.140> thing<00:02:43.860> that<00:02:44.310> we<00:02:44.730> are<00:02:44.970> going<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.660> be

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
the next thing that we are going to be

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.080 
the next thing that we are going to be
adding<00:02:46.320> into<00:02:46.500> our<00:02:46.739> singing<00:02:47.100> canary<00:02:47.519> is<00:02:47.790> you

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
adding into our singing canary is you

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.780 
adding into our singing canary is you
need<00:02:48.269> some<00:02:48.510> coconut<00:02:48.989> oil<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:49.530> if<00:02:50.220> you<00:02:50.370> use

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
need some coconut oil and if you use

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.290 
need some coconut oil and if you use
regular<00:02:51.769> extra<00:02:52.769> virgin<00:02:52.920> coconut<00:02:53.280> oil<00:02:53.610> it<00:02:54.120> is

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
regular extra virgin coconut oil it is

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.340 
regular extra virgin coconut oil it is
going<00:02:54.570> to<00:02:55.730> not<00:02:56.730> be<00:02:57.450> able<00:02:57.600> to<00:02:57.810> melt<00:02:57.989> because

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
going to not be able to melt because

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.590 
going to not be able to melt because
your<00:02:58.470> drink<00:02:58.680> is<00:02:58.800> cold<00:02:58.980> so<00:02:59.220> I<00:02:59.250> use<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.910> MCT<00:03:00.569> oil

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
your drink is cold so I use the MCT oil

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.590 
your drink is cold so I use the MCT oil
the<00:03:01.200> medium<00:03:01.530> chain<00:03:01.800> triglyceride<00:03:02.730> which<00:03:03.420> is

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
the medium chain triglyceride which is

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.740 
the medium chain triglyceride which is
the<00:03:03.720> liquid<00:03:04.050> form<00:03:04.290> of<00:03:04.410> coconut<00:03:04.739> oil<00:03:04.860> and<00:03:05.750> I

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
the liquid form of coconut oil and I

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.870 
the liquid form of coconut oil and I
probably<00:03:07.739> had<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.130> equivalent<00:03:08.489> of<00:03:08.519> about<00:03:08.670> two

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
probably had the equivalent of about two

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.550 
probably had the equivalent of about two
tablespoons<00:03:09.239> right<00:03:09.569> here<00:03:09.959> that<00:03:10.140> was<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.410> end

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
tablespoons right here that was the end

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.620 
tablespoons right here that was the end
of<00:03:10.620> my<00:03:10.739> bottle<00:03:11.100> and<00:03:11.280> then<00:03:11.970> finally<00:03:12.480> you're

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
of my bottle and then finally you're

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.140 
of my bottle and then finally you're
going<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:13.019> use<00:03:13.530> some<00:03:13.920> vanilla<00:03:14.069> extract<00:03:14.430> this

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
going to use some vanilla extract this

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.960 
going to use some vanilla extract this
is<00:03:15.330> pretty<00:03:15.540> much<00:03:15.750> to<00:03:16.050> taste<00:03:16.319> I<00:03:16.800> probably<00:03:17.610> use

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
the equivalent of a tablespoon or so of

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.020 
the equivalent of a tablespoon or so of
that<00:03:21.959> in<00:03:22.350> here<00:03:22.860> normally<00:03:23.549> I<00:03:23.579> make<00:03:23.850> my<00:03:24.000> own

that in here normally I make my own
vanilla<00:03:24.480> extract<00:03:25.019> but<00:03:25.110> I<00:03:25.260> was<00:03:25.500> out<00:03:25.709> this

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
vanilla extract but I was out this

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.000 
vanilla extract but I was out this
particular<00:03:26.610> day<00:03:27.090> so<00:03:27.420> about<00:03:28.380> a<00:03:28.440> tablespoon<00:03:28.980> of

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
particular day so about a tablespoon of

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.860 
particular day so about a tablespoon of
vanilla<00:03:29.190> you<00:03:29.549> can<00:03:29.700> adjust<00:03:30.060> this<00:03:30.209> to<00:03:30.420> taste<00:03:30.660> if

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
vanilla you can adjust this to taste if

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.569 
vanilla you can adjust this to taste if
you<00:03:30.900> like<00:03:31.019> less<00:03:31.470> if<00:03:31.709> you<00:03:31.829> like<00:03:32.010> more<00:03:32.310> that's

you like less if you like more that's
totally<00:03:33.030> fine<00:03:33.299> and<00:03:33.720> then<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.709> last<00:03:34.920> thing<00:03:35.160> of

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
totally fine and then the last thing of

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.490 
totally fine and then the last thing of
course<00:03:35.310> is<00:03:35.850> that<00:03:36.030> you<00:03:36.390> want<00:03:36.750> your<00:03:37.140> singing

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
really know that it would but you know

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.710 
really know that it would but you know

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
tell you that when it comes to essential

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.210 
tell you that when it comes to essential
oils<00:05:18.210> you<00:05:18.360> do<00:05:18.510> not<00:05:18.630> want<00:05:18.990> to<00:05:19.170> ingest<00:05:19.620> just<00:05:20.010> any

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
oils you do not want to ingest just any

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.300 
oils you do not want to ingest just any
type<00:05:20.610> of<00:05:20.640> oil<00:05:21.240> that's<00:05:22.020> why<00:05:22.320> I<00:05:22.350> chose<00:05:22.770> doTERRA

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
type of oil that's why I chose doTERRA

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.710 
type of oil that's why I chose doTERRA
because<00:05:23.610> I<00:05:23.640> was<00:05:23.880> really<00:05:24.090> comfortable<00:05:24.570> with

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
because I was really comfortable with

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.540 
because I was really comfortable with
the<00:05:24.840> quality<00:05:25.350> of<00:05:25.380> it<00:05:25.710> so<00:05:25.980> that's<00:05:26.190> the<00:05:26.400> only

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550
