00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
this because this piece actually took me

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.410 
this because this piece actually took me
over<00:00:43.510> three<00:00:44.170> hours<00:00:44.199> to<00:00:44.800> paint<00:00:45.010> and<00:00:45.339> I<00:00:46.120> actually

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
over three hours to paint and I actually

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.240 
over three hours to paint and I actually
used<00:00:46.750> up<00:00:46.899> all<00:00:47.110> of<00:00:47.320> my<00:00:47.440> memory<00:00:47.739> on<00:00:47.829> my<00:00:47.890> camera

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
used up all of my memory on my camera

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.819 
used up all of my memory on my camera
filming<00:00:48.760> this<00:00:49.269> first<00:00:49.570> part<00:00:49.870> and<00:00:50.110> I<00:00:50.559> couldn't

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
filming this first part and I couldn't

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.819 
filming this first part and I couldn't
stop<00:00:51.040> to<00:00:51.550> wait<00:00:51.940> to<00:00:52.120> download<00:00:52.510> the<00:00:52.629> photo<00:00:53.079> or

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
stop to wait to download the photo or

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:55.829 
stop to wait to download the photo or
film<00:00:54.280> and<00:00:54.579> get<00:00:54.940> my<00:00:55.089> camera<00:00:55.239> going<00:00:55.570> again

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:55.839 
film and get my camera going again

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:56.969 
film and get my camera going again
because<00:00:56.110> you<00:00:56.409> know<00:00:56.500> when<00:00:56.650> you<00:00:56.710> in<00:00:56.769> the<00:00:56.830> middle

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:56.979 
because you know when you in the middle

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:58.380 
because you know when you in the middle
of<00:00:57.070> watercolor<00:00:57.460> painting<00:00:57.760> you<00:00:57.879> just<00:00:58.119> really

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
of watercolor painting you just really

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.090 
of watercolor painting you just really
can't<00:00:58.510> stop<00:00:58.780> so<00:00:59.379> this<00:00:59.439> is<00:00:59.500> actually<00:00:59.769> just<00:00:59.890> the

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
can't stop so this is actually just the

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.649 
can't stop so this is actually just the
first<00:01:00.369> half<00:01:00.610> I<00:01:00.760> didn't<00:01:01.000> get<00:01:01.150> to<00:01:01.239> record<00:01:01.479> the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:01.659 
first half I didn't get to record the

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:03.420 
first half I didn't get to record the
second<00:01:01.960> half<00:01:02.140> but<00:01:02.379> I<00:01:02.409> thought<00:01:02.680> it's<00:01:03.159> actually

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
second half but I thought it's actually

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.189 
second half but I thought it's actually
kind<00:01:03.580> of<00:01:03.610> important<00:01:03.970> to<00:01:04.059> see<00:01:04.210> how<00:01:04.449> a<00:01:04.750> painting

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
kind of important to see how a painting

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.190 
kind of important to see how a painting
kind<00:01:05.560> of<00:01:05.650> gets<00:01:05.890> its<00:01:06.100> start<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.810> so<00:01:07.960> I'll<00:01:08.049> take

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
kind of gets its start and so I'll take

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.870 
kind of gets its start and so I'll take
you<00:01:08.320> through<00:01:08.350> the<00:01:08.530> process<00:01:08.710> so<00:01:09.189> first<00:01:09.640> thing<00:01:09.820> I

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
you through the process so first thing I

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.760 
you through the process so first thing I
did<00:01:10.060> is<00:01:10.299> I<00:01:10.330> came<00:01:10.930> up<00:01:11.049> with<00:01:11.080> initial<00:01:11.530> sketch

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
did is I came up with initial sketch

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.679 
did is I came up with initial sketch
that<00:01:12.070> I<00:01:12.130> wanted<00:01:12.430> to<00:01:12.520> do<00:01:12.729> I<00:01:12.939> had<00:01:13.270> already<00:01:13.390> done

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:13.689 
that I wanted to do I had already done

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:16.499 
that I wanted to do I had already done
one<00:01:13.960> in<00:01:14.430> one<00:01:15.430> similar<00:01:15.729> to<00:01:15.880> this<00:01:16.030> of<00:01:16.390> a

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
one in one similar to this of a

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.300 
one in one similar to this of a
clockwork<00:01:16.930> owl<00:01:17.140> and<00:01:17.740> I<00:01:17.829> thought<00:01:17.979> was<00:01:18.100> so<00:01:18.189> much

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
clockwork owl and I thought was so much

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.980 
clockwork owl and I thought was so much
fun<00:01:18.520> I<00:01:18.549> want<00:01:18.790> to<00:01:18.880> do<00:01:19.000> another<00:01:19.210> one<00:01:19.420> and<00:01:19.600> kind<00:01:19.960> of

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
fun I want to do another one and kind of

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.039 
fun I want to do another one and kind of
do<00:01:20.350> a<00:01:20.380> whole<00:01:20.590> series<00:01:20.829> of<00:01:21.009> them<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:22.659> I<00:01:22.689> sketched

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
do a whole series of them so I sketched

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.140 
do a whole series of them so I sketched
out<00:01:23.290> and<00:01:23.560> got<00:01:23.650> a<00:01:23.680> design<00:01:24.460> that<00:01:24.579> I<00:01:24.670> liked<00:01:24.909> and

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
out and got a design that I liked and

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.120 
out and got a design that I liked and
then<00:01:25.630> sketch<00:01:25.930> it<00:01:26.079> onto<00:01:26.290> my<00:01:26.409> watercolor<00:01:26.890> paper

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
then sketch it onto my watercolor paper

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.039 
then sketch it onto my watercolor paper
which<00:01:27.340> I<00:01:27.460> have<00:01:27.640> taped<00:01:27.909> two<00:01:28.149> of<00:01:28.270> my<00:01:28.420> watercolor

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
which I have taped two of my watercolor

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:31.050 
which I have taped two of my watercolor
boards<00:01:29.439> so<00:01:29.590> that<00:01:29.740> it<00:01:29.829> won't<00:01:29.950> warp<00:01:30.249> and<00:01:30.490> I'm

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
boards so that it won't warp and I'm

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.609

trying<00:01:31.359> to<00:01:31.450> push<00:01:31.630> really<00:01:31.869> lightly<00:01:32.259> on<00:01:32.590> my

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
trying to push really lightly on my

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.539 
trying to push really lightly on my
pencil<00:01:33.069> so<00:01:33.100> that<00:01:33.569> it<00:01:34.569> won't<00:01:34.749> be<00:01:35.289> hard<00:01:36.069> to<00:01:36.280> erase

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
pencil so that it won't be hard to erase

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:39.989 
pencil so that it won't be hard to erase
um<00:01:37.329> but<00:01:37.840> I'm<00:01:37.929> gonna<00:01:38.079> get<00:01:38.229> all<00:01:38.350> my<00:01:38.819> details<00:01:39.819> in

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:45.429 
you how I kind of I really quickly erase

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:46.889 
you how I kind of I really quickly erase
everything<00:01:45.729> and<00:01:45.999> then<00:01:46.179> I<00:01:46.389> don't<00:01:46.600> film<00:01:46.810> this

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
everything and then I don't film this

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.080 
everything and then I don't film this
part<00:01:47.139> but<00:01:47.229> I<00:01:47.289> inked<00:01:47.499> it<00:01:47.649> in<00:01:47.799> I'm<00:01:48.460> using<00:01:48.549> kind<00:01:49.030> of

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
part but I inked it in I'm using kind of

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.590 
part but I inked it in I'm using kind of
a<00:01:49.210> sepia<00:01:49.600> colored<00:01:50.020> ink<00:01:50.469> marker<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:52.299> it<00:01:52.450> kind

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
a sepia colored ink marker and it kind

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.910 
a sepia colored ink marker and it kind
of<00:01:52.630> gives<00:01:52.810> it<00:01:52.840> more<00:01:52.990> of<00:01:53.079> an<00:01:53.170> antique<00:01:53.590> look

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
of gives it more of an antique look

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.279 
of gives it more of an antique look
instead<00:01:54.159> of<00:01:54.280> just<00:01:54.369> using<00:01:54.549> that<00:01:54.819> really<00:01:55.289> black

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
instead of just using that really black

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:58.919 
instead of just using that really black
marker<00:01:56.859> I<00:01:57.100> kind<00:01:57.549> of<00:01:57.579> used<00:01:57.759> a<00:01:57.819> brown<00:01:58.030> one<00:01:58.240> so<00:01:58.600> it

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
marker I kind of used a brown one so it

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:00.899 
marker I kind of used a brown one so it

getting in my background and I want to

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.760 
getting in my background and I want to
fade<00:05:19.820> into<00:05:20.180> the<00:05:20.480> moon<00:05:20.840> I<00:05:21.080> don't<00:05:21.110> want<00:05:21.470> it<00:05:21.560> to<00:05:21.650> be

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
fade into the moon I don't want it to be

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.860 
fade into the moon I don't want it to be
a<00:05:21.800> sharp<00:05:22.160> edge<00:05:22.460> so<00:05:23.060> what<00:05:23.180> I<00:05:23.240> did<00:05:23.300> is<00:05:23.510> I<00:05:23.600> went<00:05:23.780> at

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
a sharp edge so what I did is I went at

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.380 
a sharp edge so what I did is I went at
the<00:05:23.960> paper<00:05:24.140> down<00:05:24.410> first<00:05:24.770> and<00:05:25.040> then<00:05:25.760> I'm<00:05:26.030> really

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
the paper down first and then I'm really

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.090 
the paper down first and then I'm really
controlling<00:05:26.750> my<00:05:26.960> water<00:05:27.170> in<00:05:27.350> my<00:05:27.470> paint<00:05:27.710> and<00:05:27.860> I'm

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
controlling my water in my paint and I'm

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.430 
controlling my water in my paint and I'm
allowing<00:05:28.400> the<00:05:28.910> paint<00:05:29.150> bleed<00:05:29.600> up<00:05:29.810> towards<00:05:30.260> the

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
allowing the paint bleed up towards the

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.080 
allowing the paint bleed up towards the
moon<00:05:30.650> but<00:05:31.130> I<00:05:31.160> think<00:05:31.340> it's<00:05:31.460> too<00:05:31.640> close<00:05:31.670> it'll

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
moon but I think it's too close it'll

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.290 
moon but I think it's too close it'll
take<00:05:32.240> a<00:05:32.270> kind<00:05:32.450> of<00:05:32.540> a<00:05:33.430> less<00:05:34.430> wet<00:05:34.670> brush<00:05:34.940> kind<00:05:35.180> of

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
take a kind of a less wet brush kind of

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.690 
take a kind of a less wet brush kind of
a<00:05:35.330> damp<00:05:35.570> brush<00:05:35.900> and<00:05:36.260> I'll<00:05:36.710> swipe<00:05:37.220> it<00:05:37.460> around

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700 
a damp brush and I'll swipe it around

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.880 
a damp brush and I'll swipe it around
there<00:05:37.940> and<00:05:38.180> pull<00:05:38.960> some<00:05:39.200> of<00:05:39.230> that<00:05:39.350> color<00:05:39.680> out<00:05:39.740> of

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:39.890 
there and pull some of that color out of

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.400 
there and pull some of that color out of
there<00:05:40.160> and<00:05:40.280> that<00:05:40.370> really<00:05:40.580> just<00:05:40.730> helps<00:05:41.210> to<00:05:41.410> keep

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 
there and that really just helps to keep

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.640 
there and that really just helps to keep
that<00:05:42.590> moon<00:05:42.980> really<00:05:43.340> really<00:05:43.730> bright<00:05:44.570> white<00:05:44.930> but

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
that moon really really bright white but

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.330 
that moon really really bright white but
also<00:05:45.890> not<00:05:46.490> allow<00:05:46.850> for<00:05:47.480> the<00:05:47.920> paint<00:05:48.920> to<00:05:49.040> kind<00:05:49.220> of

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
also not allow for the paint to kind of

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.370 
also not allow for the paint to kind of
run<00:05:49.610> in<00:05:49.760> there<00:05:49.970> so<00:05:50.810> pretty<00:05:50.990> much<00:05:51.200> this<00:05:51.320> is

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 
run in there so pretty much this is

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.890 
run in there so pretty much this is
about<00:05:51.710> all<00:05:51.890> I've<00:05:52.100> got<00:05:52.310> recorded<00:05:53.180> about<00:05:53.690> this
