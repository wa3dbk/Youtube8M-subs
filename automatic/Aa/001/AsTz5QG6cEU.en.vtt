00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.589
 hello hello guys girls that for all 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.569
 I am a fiery 22 welcome to an egg 

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:10.179
 trillions won and what is this that is 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:12.969
 here enter a delegated code 15 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:16.030
 so good today the video is in thanks to 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:18.550
 the courtesy of nba 2k spain that has 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:22.080
 facilitated to all members of the ass 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:25.330
 the goods of the mafia a code with the 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.640
 player stephen carr and ruby james harden 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.940
 ruby or anthony davis ruby ​​players 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.980
 what are they giving with the coin 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.920
 or the spike coin reads this that 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.600
 distributed rum and in e3 and that is 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.940
 doing two campaigns also raffles of 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.490
 the coins so I think they are now 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.050
 have done this afternoon a good one this 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.760
 late one day they did it on twitter with 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.130
 networks and recently did it in 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.160
 facebook and you had to tell a story 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.870
 something like that the ones he liked the most because 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.239
 they sent 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.469
 I think the problem if they sent you 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.890
 Physically home currency 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.850
 if you win he asks for the address and so on 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.370
 so if any of you have 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.600
 contest to ask for the address because that 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.869
 it's a good sign that you have won 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.479
 something and they're going to send you something good 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.369
 we are here putting the little code to 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:13.659
 little let's see who I am already 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.200
 I know that other options 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:19.570
 harden stephen carr i do and babys by 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.030
 prefer I think it's the best 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.460
 sells and in more the one that costs more than 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.990
 get out of that james harden because the one 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.940
 it's worth sanfeliz davis and then I'm 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.340
 as expensive and as there is the gold one of 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.289
 sapphire and the pin diamond is a bit 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.700
 devalued because enough and now in 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:37.630
 change james harden I think that there the 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:43.140
 gold ruby and diamond if I do not 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:50.700
 I'm wrong there are three only if James Harden 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:54.040
 let's go good let's go to my team running 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:58.030
 to see how much this man costs 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.530
 james harden nenes fuck yes sir before 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.940
 before I am telling the story that 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.910
 I want to stop taking 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.950

 facebook on twitter although I know that 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.510

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.939
 answer it 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.709

 so that sharon that discount that they tune 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:57.250
 I can see from 200,000 mt not 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.830
 They are too expensive and now no 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:03.729
 is the price because it varies quite according to 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.930
 there is more or less but it does not vary around 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:08.409
 to more than ten euros top down 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:10.030
 always moves in that 10 up and 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:11.500
 down there does not come out or that is 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.229
 a fairly stable page has a 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:16.240
