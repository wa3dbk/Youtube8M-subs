00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
then maybe step away from tradition a

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.530 
then maybe step away from tradition a
little<00:00:34.140> bit<00:00:34.320> so<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:35.489> want<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.270> show<00:00:36.480> you

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
little bit so I want to show you

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.170 
little bit so I want to show you
something<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.190> display<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:38.790> we

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
something that is a display that we

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.690 
something that is a display that we
created<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.230> think<00:00:40.530> does<00:00:40.710> step<00:00:41.370> away<00:00:41.520> from

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
created that I think does step away from

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.850 
created that I think does step away from
tradition<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:43.079> think<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.219> might<00:00:44.430> be<00:00:45.800> out<00:00:46.800> of

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
tradition I think it might be out of

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.549 
tradition I think it might be out of
character<00:00:47.370> or<00:00:49.280> not<00:00:50.280> classy<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.570> talk<00:00:52.350> about

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
character or not classy to talk about

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.650 
character or not classy to talk about
the<00:00:52.829> subtleties<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.550> display<00:00:54.000> your<00:00:54.239> talking

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
the subtleties of a display your talking

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.689 
the subtleties of a display your talking
about<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.930> traditional<00:00:55.590> Japanese<00:00:56.190> display

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
about a traditional Japanese display

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.150 
about a traditional Japanese display
that<00:00:57.120> would<00:00:57.270> be<00:00:57.390> out<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.570> character<00:00:57.870> but<00:00:58.770> since

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
that would be out of character but since

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.430 
that would be out of character but since
this<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.489> something<00:01:00.109> stepping<00:01:01.109> out<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.260> the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
this is something stepping out of the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.280 
this is something stepping out of the
box<00:01:01.969> and<00:01:02.969> trying<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.750> step<00:01:03.930> out<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
traditional Japanese box I am going to

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.840 
traditional Japanese box I am going to
try<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.049> talk<00:01:07.860> about<00:01:08.010> some<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.460> layers<00:01:08.670> and

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
try to talk about some of the layers and

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.969 
try to talk about some of the layers and
subtleties<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.450> this<00:01:09.689> display<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.650> may<00:01:10.950> take

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
subtleties of this display it may take

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.280 
subtleties of this display it may take
two<00:01:11.520> parts<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:12.030> this<00:01:12.150> video<00:01:12.540> I'm<00:01:12.720> limited<00:01:13.170> to

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
two parts of this video I'm limited to

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.440 
two parts of this video I'm limited to
five<00:01:13.530> minutes<00:01:13.560> on<00:01:14.100> creating<00:01:14.610> my<00:01:14.760> videos<00:01:15.150> here

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
five minutes on creating my videos here

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.390 
five minutes on creating my videos here
so<00:01:15.780> if<00:01:16.439> there<00:01:16.740> may<00:01:16.890> have<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.130> be<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.430> part<00:01:17.729> two<00:01:19.400> so

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
so if there may have to be a part two so

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.280 
so if there may have to be a part two so
anyhow<00:01:20.759> let's<00:01:21.000> get<00:01:21.180> started<00:01:21.630> ken<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.259> have

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
anyhow let's get started ken and I have

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.820 
anyhow let's get started ken and I have
had<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.450> have<00:01:24.450> been<00:01:24.570> working<00:01:24.990> on<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.350> ideas

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
had the have been working on the ideas

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.090 
had the have been working on the ideas
with<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.100> concept<00:01:26.700> behind<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.710> display<00:01:28.710> for

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
with a concept behind this display for

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.310 
with a concept behind this display for
nearly<00:01:29.579> two<00:01:29.909> years<00:01:30.150> now<00:01:30.450> it's<00:01:31.200> really<00:01:33.320> evolved

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
nearly two years now it's really evolved

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.700 
nearly two years now it's really evolved
greatly<00:01:35.090> over<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.270> time<00:01:36.570> but<00:01:36.960> here's<00:01:37.530> the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
greatly over that time but here's the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.289 
greatly over that time but here's the
final<00:01:37.920> display<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.700> that's<00:01:38.850> really<00:01:39.030> two

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
final display and that's really two

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.950 
final display and that's really two
years<00:01:39.570> worth<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:39.990> work<00:01:40.200> now<00:01:41.030> I<00:01:42.030> guess<00:01:42.780> what

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
years worth of work now I guess what

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.170 
years worth of work now I guess what
you're<00:01:43.110> seeing<00:01:43.350> right<00:01:43.439> now<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:44.100> you're<00:01:45.000> seeing

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
you're seeing right now is you're seeing

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.289 
you're seeing right now is you're seeing

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
from the state of South Carolina on and

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.199 
from the state of South Carolina on and
we're<00:02:33.120> both<00:02:33.390> just<00:02:33.930> in<00:02:34.170> awe<00:02:34.380> of<00:02:34.459> the<00:02:35.459> nature<00:02:35.910> and

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
natural wonder of South Carolina we

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.270 
natural wonder of South Carolina we
thought<00:02:38.880> a<00:02:38.910> a<00:02:39.500> display<00:02:40.500> that<00:02:40.530> might<00:02:40.980> share

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
thought a a display that might share

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.199 
thought a a display that might share
that<00:02:41.630> would<00:02:42.630> be<00:02:42.780> in<00:02:42.870> order<00:02:43.080> so<00:02:43.470> this<00:02:43.770> display

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
that would be in order so this display

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.100 
that would be in order so this display
represents<00:02:45.209> a<00:02:45.270> journey<00:02:45.510> from<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.840> mountain
