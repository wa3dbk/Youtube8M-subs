haven't got a full unit just got a small
magnet<00:01:47.049> here<00:01:47.320> and<00:01:47.620> if<00:01:47.830> I<00:01:48.010> do<00:01:48.760> this<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:50.110> actually

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
magnet here and if I do this it actually

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.190 
magnet here and if I do this it actually
does<00:01:51.220> turn<00:01:51.549> on<00:01:51.760> enough<00:01:52.180> which<00:01:52.420> isn't<00:01:52.810> a<00:01:52.930> great

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
does turn on enough which isn't a great

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.620 
does turn on enough which isn't a great
feature<00:01:53.560> and<00:01:54.010> for<00:01:54.670> apple<00:01:54.940> now<00:01:55.120> I<00:01:55.150> don't<00:01:55.299> know

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
feature and for apple now I don't know

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.620 
feature and for apple now I don't know
if<00:01:55.840> they've<00:01:56.260> done<00:01:56.470> this<00:01:57.000> purposely<00:01:58.000> or<00:01:58.270> not

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
if they've done this purposely or not

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.560 
if they've done this purposely or not
and<00:01:59.850> haven't<00:02:00.850> got<00:02:00.970> a<00:02:01.000> clue<00:02:01.150> but<00:02:01.420> it's

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
and haven't got a clue but it's

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:02.940

something that I think they really need
to<00:02:03.580> sort<00:02:03.790> out<00:02:03.909> there's<00:02:04.150> a<00:02:04.210> lot<00:02:04.420> of<00:02:04.450> people<00:02:04.659> out

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810
