00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.789
 I had already shaping my blog 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:15.460
 tripod written by the company way 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:19.210
 but today this video used to 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:22.539
 something about the tripod head too 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.699
 one has to declare at the celebration 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.660
 choice between three heads I have 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.359
 me for the 10th 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.779
 40 d decided the differences 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:33.100
 actually so naturally the size of the 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.059
 Kugelkopf discussion Weltkugel and 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.190
 ultimately the strength of the tripod 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.660
 with the tripod comes that you beside 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.059
 I can adjust to the same 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.969
 still would be a panorama screw 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.620
 has like turning the knob of the gib 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:49.870
 Tripod head make it possible of course 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.710
 also for fixing to a desired 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.850
 location 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:57.370
 the upper part clearly akershus compatible 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.440
 clutch plate first at the 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.359
 Camera is attached here you have to 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.440
 However, note that in the mega too 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:09.009
 other clutch plates no lime 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.209
 a small hill has but one 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.479
 screwdriver a small coin 

00:01:10.209 --> 00:01:14.800
 sometimes this has to be thought of 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.899
 interesting for what you actually 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.910
 relatively little information is found 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:21.009
 as the ball head set 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.679
 or can be locked 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.360
 there one finds marazzi flies to it 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:26.950
 important people are screwing 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.580
 Determine screws and the stopps 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.459
 screw 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.890
 there you will find the wildest entries in 

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:35.110
 Forums say so if the thing here 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.250
 You can not get that done and if you can 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.509
 no position as adjust that applies 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.399
 but not and the stopps screw can 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.770
 only be opened with a bottle 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.479
 that's not the case if you do 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.250
 The device when you delivered the head 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.440
 or does not know how to continue 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.679
 is the easiest to determine 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.959
 completely close the screw 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.899
 firmly shut and then the 

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:57.130
 Stops screw with two fingers 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.140
 Refueling convincing are reopened 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.000
 become 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.879
 if I screw the notice 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.379
 would let the cuckoo clock 

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:06.910
 easy that just tilt forward 

00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:08.200
 and of course the camera would be on 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.200
 no case can reach 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.350
 Now it is important with the manufacturer 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.380
 screw the desired one at that time 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.910
 fractions as the saying goes, google 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.550
 to adjust the head 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.260
 and this point you have then first 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.700
 can now understand a the stoppages 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.970
 turn clockwise again 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:31.030
 with two fingers to turn and to the 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.410
 point then the relative though 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.630
 be completed 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.670
 but if I open it it will only 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.250
 still open to the point because 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.970
 previously set that means she 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.100
 holds in position with the rotation and 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.930
 so again with the danger that 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.240
 The slide simply tilts to the side 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.730
 and the tripod eventually 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.260
 There is no longer any that gives 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.110
 is actually the easy operation 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.300
 This tripod head and I hope you 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.900
 This information has helped 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.470
 leads over asking comments 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.470
 until the 1st
