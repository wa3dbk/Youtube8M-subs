00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.610 
the brushes easily so I say it's time to
mix<00:02:20.390> in<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.630> palette<00:02:20.930> maybe<00:02:21.170> two<00:02:21.410> in<00:02:21.530> the

I if I need to but my basic palette is

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:40.600 
I if I need to but my basic palette is
is<00:04:38.090> this<00:04:38.360> one<00:04:38.539> and<00:04:38.690> I<00:04:39.259> always<00:04:39.830> sort<00:04:40.160> of<00:04:40.280> start

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
is this one and I always sort of start

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.129 
is this one and I always sort of start
with<00:04:40.789> this<00:04:40.910> palette<00:04:41.300> because<00:04:41.389> most<00:04:41.870> of<00:04:42.020> these

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
with this palette because most of these

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.070 
with this palette because most of these
colors<00:04:42.350> are<00:04:42.620> very<00:04:42.740> quick<00:04:43.430> drawing<00:04:43.990> for<00:04:44.990> the

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
colors are very quick drawing for the

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.689 
colors are very quick drawing for the
early<00:04:45.350> stages<00:04:45.680> of<00:04:45.949> a<00:04:46.009> painting<00:04:46.340> when<00:04:46.430> you<00:04:46.520> want
