because<00:04:53.060> you<00:04:54.060> know<00:04:54.200> new<00:04:55.200> cameras<00:04:55.590> aren't<00:04:55.800> very

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
because you know new cameras aren't very

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:02.750 
because you know new cameras aren't very
nice<00:04:56.870> moving<00:04:57.870> around<00:05:00.410> and<00:05:01.410> the<00:05:02.400> hair<00:05:02.580> always

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.560 
nice moving around and the hair always
goes<00:05:03.030> a<00:05:03.620> bit<00:05:04.620> over<00:05:05.100> where<00:05:06.090> you<00:05:06.120> have<00:05:06.540> that

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
goes a bit over where you have that

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.460 
goes a bit over where you have that
drawn<00:05:07.229> so<00:05:07.650> that's<00:05:08.100> why<00:05:08.220> we<00:05:08.400> sort<00:05:08.640> of<00:05:08.729> make<00:05:08.820> it<00:05:08.850> a

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470
