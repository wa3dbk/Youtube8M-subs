00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.969
 and fast auriga speed 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:10.669
 an unequal way 

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:13.829

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.080
 this price at the criminal age easy level 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.370
 the principle can not be simpler 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.630
 just pay on the dots 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.340

 the number 2 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.500

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.500
 outdoor guide 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.730
 he then passes 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.200
 at number 3 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.050
 well number 3 4 out of 6 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.310
 the rain 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.310
 I trust 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.869
 nothing very complicated 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.869
 show it to you 

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:15.959
 number four 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.959
 the city 

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:26.479
 there is no more power population and so we go 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:29.599
 in the tour to search 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.599
 the next most innovative bus 5 

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:36.569
 and then you have to of course 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.569
 by folding but in 2005 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:49.189
 then it's outfits but in 6 hours 

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:53.079
 in the same way 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:54.319
 the lille 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.029
 but the moment 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:02:59.139
 good we see that m 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:02.139
 it's not done yet 

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:05.679

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:13.449
 it's not done yet 

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:19.969
 but that will not stop our friend from working 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:22.969
 the coastline 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.269

 as we've seen 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.279
 rains 

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:38.279
 Additional 

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:40.139
 It will be good 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:43.139
 at the bourbon-bourbon palace ruffier 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.569
 the nice trio 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:53.839
 6 

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:56.839
 this is our last couple 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:01.809

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.089
 all children know 

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:15.559
 this doubled 

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:18.689
 this goal is also another function 

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:20.609
 if torres control 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:21.949
 it is therefore m 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:23.990
