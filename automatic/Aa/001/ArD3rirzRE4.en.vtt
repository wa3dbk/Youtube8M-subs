another video today and this time we got
an<00:00:04.200> overclocking<00:00:04.680> well<00:00:05.190> I<00:00:05.460> guess<00:00:05.609> you<00:00:05.730> say

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
an overclocking well I guess you say

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.230 
an overclocking well I guess you say
it's<00:00:06.270> kind<00:00:06.420> of<00:00:06.450> a<00:00:06.569> overclocking<00:00:07.440> guide<00:00:07.589> for

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.240 
it's kind of a overclocking guide for

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.970 
it's kind of a overclocking guide for
the<00:00:09.240> new<00:00:09.389> cartridges<00:00:09.900> about<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.620> three<00:00:10.830> of

brain<00:00:13.920> and<00:00:14.190> this<00:00:14.880> as<00:00:15.120> you<00:00:15.299> can<00:00:15.420> see<00:00:15.540> right<00:00:15.660> here

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
brain and this as you can see right here

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.910 
brain and this as you can see right here
there's<00:00:16.020> my<00:00:16.080> of<00:00:16.230> course<00:00:16.320> right<00:00:16.650> there<00:00:16.830> I've

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
there's my of course right there I've

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.830 
there's my of course right there I've
got<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.130> core<00:00:17.369> clock<00:00:17.550> at<00:00:17.730> 10:50<00:00:18.420> cuz<00:00:18.690> that's

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
got the core clock at 10:50 cuz that's

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.120 
got the core clock at 10:50 cuz that's
about<00:00:19.020> as<00:00:19.109> far<00:00:19.230> as<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.500> can<00:00:19.560> go<00:00:19.740> without<00:00:20.010> an

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
about as far as I can go without an

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.769 
about as far as I can go without an
artifact<00:00:20.640> thing<00:00:20.850> or<00:00:21.000> about<00:00:21.270> function<00:00:21.660> one

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
artifact thing or about function one

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.710 
artifact thing or about function one
night<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:22.170> got<00:00:22.500> 5%<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:23.310> power<00:00:23.670> limit<00:00:24.090> up<00:00:24.240> the

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
night I got 5% a power limit up the

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.320 
night I got 5% a power limit up the
social<00:00:24.960> plus<00:00:25.289> files<00:00:25.500> 105<00:00:26.220> percent<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:27.210> all

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
social plus files 105 percent and all

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.880 
social plus files 105 percent and all
that<00:00:27.449> other<00:00:27.539> stuff<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.199> memory<00:00:28.439> stays<00:00:28.680> at

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
that other stuff and the memory stays at

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.470 
that other stuff and the memory stays at
1,400<00:00:29.550> cuz<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:29.760> don't<00:00:29.849> want<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.090> touch<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.390> head

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
1,400 cuz I don't want to touch the head

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.060 
1,400 cuz I don't want to touch the head
cuz<00:00:30.689> then<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:31.199> know<00:00:31.289> just<00:00:31.500> start<00:00:31.650> messing<00:00:31.800> up

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
cuz then you know just start messing up

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.560 
cuz then you know just start messing up
and<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.340> have<00:00:32.489> not<00:00:32.669> had<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.059> experience<00:00:33.090> with

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
and I have not had the experience with

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.790 
and I have not had the experience with
off<00:00:33.750> clock<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.140> memory<00:00:34.410> but<00:00:34.559> it's<00:00:34.680> all

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
off clock in the memory but it's all

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.270 
off clock in the memory but it's all
good

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
good

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.340 
good
1,400<00:00:36.210> feet<00:00:36.329> just<00:00:36.600> enough<00:00:36.899> because<00:00:37.110> of

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
1,400 feet just enough because of

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.369 
1,400 feet just enough because of
effective<00:00:37.860> memory<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.390> 5,800<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.480> think<00:00:40.110> if<00:00:40.290> I

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
effective memory of 5,800 I think if I

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.049 
effective memory of 5,800 I think if I
got<00:00:40.530> my<00:00:40.590> map<00:00:40.860> right<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.550> we're<00:00:41.700> going<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.969> get

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
got my map right so we're going to get

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.510 
got my map right so we're going to get
you<00:00:42.510> right<00:00:42.660> into<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:43.050> Ankush<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.190> here<00:00:44.399> I'm

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
you right into it Ankush to here I'm

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.600 
you right into it Ankush to here I'm
just<00:00:44.670> running<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.910> loop<00:00:45.090> on<00:00:45.770> some<00:00:46.770> battlefield

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
just running a loop on some battlefield

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.119 
just running a loop on some battlefield
4<00:00:47.789> gameplay<00:00:47.820> everything<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.870> on<00:00:49.020> ultra<00:00:49.500> pretty

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
4 gameplay everything is on ultra pretty

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.910 
4 gameplay everything is on ultra pretty
much<00:00:50.250> maxed<00:00:50.640> out<00:00:50.969> uh<00:00:51.590> anti-alias<00:00:52.590> say<00:00:52.770> the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
much maxed out uh anti-alias say the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.979 
much maxed out uh anti-alias say the
motion<00:00:53.100> blur<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.520> off<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.059> vsync<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.570> on<00:00:54.780> so

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
motion blur is off and vsync is on so

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.299 
motion blur is off and vsync is on so
you<00:00:55.050> can<00:00:55.170> see<00:00:55.199> all<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.590> next<00:00:55.770> frame<00:00:56.010> rates

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
you can see all the next frame rates

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:56.840 
you can see all the next frame rates
right<00:00:56.489> there

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
right there

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.220 
right there
as<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.420> see<00:00:57.539> I'm<00:00:57.660> shooting<00:00:57.930> at<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.050> ground

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
as you see I'm shooting at the ground

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.569 
as you see I'm shooting at the ground
which<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.469> get<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.800> dust<00:00:59.039> I'll<00:00:59.250> try<00:00:59.370> gets

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
which I get that dust I'll try gets

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.490 
which I get that dust I'll try gets
particles<00:01:00.090> try<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.390> really<00:01:00.870> push<00:01:01.050> his<00:01:01.199> car<00:01:01.350> as

particles try to really push his car as

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.759 
particles try to really push his car as
far<00:01:01.710> as<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:01.859> can<00:01:01.920> go<00:01:02.190> as<00:01:02.550> far<00:01:02.670> as<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.850> can<00:01:02.910> go

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
me that's me going to some office space

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.060 
me that's me going to some office space
you<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.110> ground<00:01:10.229> some<00:01:10.500> more<00:01:10.650> I'm<00:01:10.830> really

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
you in the ground some more I'm really

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.560 
you in the ground some more I'm really
trying<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.310> push<00:01:11.400> his<00:01:11.640> car<00:01:11.850> try<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.240> see<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
trying to push his car try to see the

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.810 
trying to push his car try to see the
physics<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.229> graphics<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.950> all<00:01:14.610> the

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
physics and graphics and all the

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.100 
physics and graphics and all the
particles<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.420> air<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.689> really<00:01:15.780> trying<00:01:16.020> to

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
particles in the air is really trying to

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.840 
particles in the air is really trying to
push<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.380> cards<00:01:16.650> how<00:01:16.770> far<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.070> can<00:01:17.189> go<00:01:17.400> and

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
push the cards how far I can go and

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.280 
push the cards how far I can go and
things<00:01:18.090> like<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.299> as<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.869> say<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.049> went<00:01:19.200> to

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
things like that as you say I went to

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.440 
things like that as you say I went to
some<00:01:19.500> vegetation<00:01:20.100> because<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:21.060> can<00:01:21.240> really

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
some vegetation because I can really

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.450 
some vegetation because I can really
beat<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.080> could<00:01:22.229> really<00:01:22.320> texture<00:01:22.740> bring<00:01:23.369> the

push<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.600> graphics<00:01:33.840> card<00:01:34.049> as<00:01:34.110> well<00:01:34.290> there's

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
push the graphics card as well there's

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.609 
push the graphics card as well there's
me<00:01:35.189> going<00:01:35.400> over<00:01:35.610> space<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.329> they<00:01:36.930> uh<00:01:36.960> don't

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
me going over space and they uh don't

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.170 
me going over space and they uh don't
worry<00:01:37.950> about<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.220> frame<00:01:38.369> right<00:01:38.729> there<00:01:38.820> you

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
worry about the frame right there you

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.490 
worry about the frame right there you
know<00:01:39.210> looking<00:01:39.509> at<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.810> sky<00:01:40.049> because<00:01:40.380> they're

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
know looking at the sky because they're

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.929 
know looking at the sky because they're
not<00:01:40.710> going<00:01:40.950> up<00:01:41.130> in<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.310> sky<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.579> know<00:01:41.850> the

not going up in the sky you know the

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.359 
not going up in the sky you know the
fairways<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.540> just<00:01:42.659> gonna<00:01:42.950> just<00:01:43.950> gonna<00:01:44.100> max

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
fairways is just gonna just gonna max

out all the way there's be shooting at
the<00:01:46.200> ground<00:01:46.470> I'm<00:01:47.130> just<00:01:47.520> describing

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
the ground I'm just describing

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.910 
the ground I'm just describing
everything<00:01:48.240> I'm<00:01:48.420> doing<00:01:48.780> because<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:49.409> said<00:01:49.770> well

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
everything I'm doing because I said well

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.350 
everything I'm doing because I said well
if<00:01:50.189> we're<00:01:50.340> number<00:01:50.549> two<00:01:50.790> this<00:01:50.909> video<00:01:51.210> I'm<00:01:51.299> just

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
if we're number two this video I'm just

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.639 
if we're number two this video I'm just
gonna<00:01:51.630> I'm<00:01:51.869> just<00:01:51.899> showing<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.320> what<00:01:52.470> kind<00:01:52.619> of

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
gonna I'm just showing of what kind of

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.499 
gonna I'm just showing of what kind of
overclocking<00:01:53.189> get<00:01:53.369> now<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.939> overclock<00:01:54.390> that

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
overclocking get now the overclock that

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.060 
overclocking get now the overclock that
I<00:01:54.570> have<00:01:54.720> isn't<00:01:55.049> really<00:01:55.200> all<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.380> intensive

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
I have isn't really all that intensive

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.359 
I have isn't really all that intensive
and<00:01:57.030> all<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.420> because<00:01:57.540> um<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:58.320> tried<00:01:59.130> pushing

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
and all that because um I tried pushing

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.819 
and all that because um I tried pushing
the<00:01:59.520> car<00:01:59.729> at<00:02:00.119> least<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.689> 1,100<00:02:01.409> but<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.680> just

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
the car at least to 1,100 but it just

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.380 
the car at least to 1,100 but it just
kept<00:02:02.040> artifacting<00:02:02.729> while<00:02:02.969> we're<00:02:03.180> in<00:02:03.299> the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
kept artifacting while we're in the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.999 
kept artifacting while we're in the
valley<00:02:03.540> pinch<00:02:03.869> marks<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.350> guess<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.829> valley

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
valley pinch marks I guess the valley

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.170 
valley pinch marks I guess the valley
benchmark<00:02:05.490> would<00:02:05.549> have<00:02:05.670> been<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.790> better<00:02:05.939> video

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
benchmark would have been a better video

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.479 
benchmark would have been a better video
but<00:02:06.570> it's<00:02:06.659> all<00:02:06.780> good<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.680> well<00:02:07.770> run<00:02:08.220> of<00:02:08.369> a

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
but it's all good and well run of a

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.309 
but it's all good and well run of a
valley<00:02:08.700> benchmark<00:02:09.209> there's<00:02:09.660> like<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:10.020> lot<00:02:10.229> of

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
valley benchmark there's like a lot of

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.100 
valley benchmark there's like a lot of
artifacts<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.760> driver<00:02:12.330> just<00:02:12.569> kept<00:02:12.750> crying

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
artifacts the driver just kept crying

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.550 
artifacts the driver just kept crying
and<00:02:13.350> things<00:02:13.500> like<00:02:13.680> that<00:02:13.740> him<00:02:14.600> yeah<00:02:15.600> so<00:02:16.170> what

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
and things like that him yeah so what

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.040 
and things like that him yeah so what
you<00:02:16.680> just<00:02:16.710> saw<00:02:17.100> was<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.550> a<00:02:17.580> stock<00:02:18.300> clock<00:02:18.630> of

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
you just saw was the a stock clock of

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.340 
you just saw was the a stock clock of
the<00:02:19.440> all<00:02:19.560> of<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:21.030> r9<00:02:21.180> 380<00:02:21.570> and<00:02:21.930> here<00:02:22.080> is<00:02:22.200> my

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
the all of the r9 380 and here is my

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.900 
the all of the r9 380 and here is my
overclock<00:02:22.890> right<00:02:23.130> here<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.580> should<00:02:23.640> have

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
overclock right here I should have

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.310 
overclock right here I should have
mentioned<00:02:24.030> that<00:02:24.210> before<00:02:24.330> like<00:02:24.750> said<00:02:24.930> led<00:02:25.110> the

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
mentioned that before like said led the

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.810 
mentioned that before like said led the
last<00:02:25.500> clip<00:02:25.800> you<00:02:25.890> just<00:02:25.920> saw<00:02:26.100> was<00:02:26.430> this<00:02:26.610> time

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
last clip you just saw was this time

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.580 
last clip you just saw was this time
clock<00:02:27.060> this<00:02:27.480> is<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.720> overclock<00:02:28.290> right<00:02:28.440> here

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
clock this is the overclock right here

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.680 
clock this is the overclock right here
at<00:02:28.740> 10:50<00:02:29.430> cuz<00:02:29.640> this<00:02:29.820> about<00:02:30.090> as<00:02:30.180> far<00:02:30.330> as<00:02:30.480> I<00:02:30.540> can

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
at 10:50 cuz this about as far as I can

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.080 
at 10:50 cuz this about as far as I can
push<00:02:30.900> it<00:02:31.110> I<00:02:31.260> could<00:02:31.710> probably<00:02:31.800> push<00:02:32.130> 1055<00:02:32.820> but

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
push it I could probably push 1055 but

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.790 
push it I could probably push 1055 but
1060<00:02:33.600> is<00:02:33.690> just<00:02:33.870> oh<00:02:33.990> we<00:02:34.200> cuz<00:02:34.380> it's<00:02:34.530> doing<00:02:34.740> the

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
1060 is just oh we cuz it's doing the

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.310 
1060 is just oh we cuz it's doing the
artifacts<00:02:35.490> in<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.640> background<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.300> here<00:02:37.230> we

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
artifacts in the background and here we

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.110

up<00:02:54.270> on<00:02:54.390> my<00:02:54.690> FPS<00:02:55.110> you<00:02:55.560> can<00:02:55.739> see<00:02:55.920> that<00:02:56.160> there's<00:02:56.340> a

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
up on my FPS you can see that there's a

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.090 
up on my FPS you can see that there's a
little<00:02:56.790> bit<00:02:56.910> of<00:02:56.940> a<00:02:57.120> bump<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:58.320> uh<00:02:58.530> if<00:02:58.830> he<00:02:59.010> is

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
little bit of a bump and uh if he is

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.250 
little bit of a bump and uh if he is
government<00:02:59.520> to<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.700> same<00:03:00.000> loop<00:03:00.330> like<00:03:00.900> almost

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
government to the same loop like almost

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.449 
government to the same loop like almost
in<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.560> sand<00:03:01.770> away<00:03:01.920> I<00:03:02.420> also<00:03:03.680> shot<00:03:04.680> this<00:03:04.920> most

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
in the sand away I also shot this most

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.670 
in the sand away I also shot this most
of<00:03:05.580> the<00:03:05.610> same<00:03:05.790> kind<00:03:06.090> of<00:03:06.270> the<00:03:06.780> same<00:03:07.020> oil<00:03:07.350> drums

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
of the same kind of the same oil drums

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.930 
of the same kind of the same oil drums
and<00:03:07.890> things<00:03:07.980> like<00:03:08.160> that<00:03:08.310> you<00:03:08.430> know<00:03:08.580> done<00:03:08.760> it<00:03:08.850> in

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
and things like that you know done it in

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.220 
and things like that you know done it in
the<00:03:09.000> same<00:03:09.150> position<00:03:09.570> you<00:03:09.600> know<00:03:09.780> it<00:03:09.900> still<00:03:10.050> he's

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
the same position you know it still he's

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.500 
the same position you know it still he's
shown<00:03:10.440> an<00:03:10.680> explosion<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:11.670> fire<00:03:11.700> right<00:03:12.150> there

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
shown an explosion and fire right there

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.360 
shown an explosion and fire right there
I<00:03:12.540> just<00:03:13.260> I<00:03:13.380> ran<00:03:13.680> through<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:13.950> fire<00:03:14.160> you<00:03:14.340> know

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
I just I ran through the fire you know

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.920 
I just I ran through the fire you know
to<00:03:14.489> get<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:14.760> particle<00:03:15.120> to<00:03:15.209> face<00:03:15.390> and<00:03:15.690> you<00:03:15.810> can

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
to get the particle to face and you can

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.600 
to get the particle to face and you can
see<00:03:15.959> that<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.320> drag<00:03:16.800> race<00:03:17.010> kind<00:03:17.310> of<00:03:17.400> dropped

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
see that the drag race kind of dropped

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.780 
see that the drag race kind of dropped
just<00:03:17.700> a<00:03:17.850> little<00:03:18.150> bit<00:03:18.239> more<00:03:18.420> and<00:03:18.890> and<00:03:19.890> in<00:03:20.670> a

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
just a little bit more and and in a

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:21.890 
just a little bit more and and in a
minute<00:03:20.910> I'm<00:03:21.120> going<00:03:21.239> to<00:03:21.360> be<00:03:21.540> shooting<00:03:21.660> at<00:03:21.810> the

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
minute I'm going to be shooting at the

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.330 
minute I'm going to be shooting at the
ground<00:03:22.170> like<00:03:22.260> I<00:03:22.380> always<00:03:22.530> do<00:03:22.799> try<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.070> get<00:03:23.220> my

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
ground like I always do try to get my

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.190 
ground like I always do try to get my
particles<00:03:23.760> of<00:03:23.850> the<00:03:24.390> physics<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:24.989> dust

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
particles of the physics and the dust

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.770 
particles of the physics and the dust
and<00:03:25.410> all<00:03:25.530> that<00:03:25.709> other<00:03:25.830> this<00:03:26.040> stuff<00:03:26.280> and<00:03:26.660> as<00:03:27.660> you

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
and all that other this stuff and as you

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.600 
and all that other this stuff and as you
can<00:03:27.870> see<00:03:27.930> even<00:03:28.410> with<00:03:28.709> all<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.070> particles<00:03:29.340> in

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
can see even with all the particles in

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:30.350 
can see even with all the particles in
the<00:03:29.700> air<00:03:29.790> right<00:03:30.030> there

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
the air right there

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.020 
the air right there
it<00:03:30.600> barely<00:03:31.260> dropped<00:03:31.650> until<00:03:32.220> like<00:03:32.730> just<00:03:32.940> a<00:03:33.000> few

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
it barely dropped until like just a few

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.250 
it barely dropped until like just a few
seconds<00:03:33.510> ago<00:03:33.540> right<00:03:33.810> there<00:03:33.959> with<00:03:34.049> the<00:03:34.110> drop

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
seconds ago right there with the drop

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.449 
seconds ago right there with the drop
down<00:03:34.410> to<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.590> 40s<00:03:35.040> I<00:03:35.070> think<00:03:35.280> there's

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
down to the 40s I think there's

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:36.470 
down to the 40s I think there's
something<00:03:35.670> wrong<00:03:35.760> with<00:03:35.820> my<00:03:36.000> car<00:03:36.209> you<00:03:36.450> know

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
something wrong with my car you know

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.800 
something wrong with my car you know
somebody<00:03:36.900> some<00:03:37.110> aroma<00:03:37.500> or<00:03:37.680> overclock<00:03:38.600> but<00:03:39.600> I

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
somebody some aroma or overclock but I

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
say do what the whole video ever ends

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.390 
say do what the whole video ever ends
are<00:03:42.930> saying<00:03:43.110> almost<00:03:43.290> I'm<00:03:43.890> going<00:03:44.100> to<00:03:44.190> the<00:03:44.250> same

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
are saying almost I'm going to the same

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.030 
are saying almost I'm going to the same
meditation<00:03:45.030> as<00:03:45.120> well<00:03:45.380> in<00:03:46.380> a<00:03:46.500> while<00:03:46.620> I'm<00:03:46.830> trying

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
meditation as well in a while I'm trying

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.800 
meditation as well in a while I'm trying
to<00:03:47.100> say<00:03:47.220> it<00:03:47.280> to<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.549> video<00:03:47.820> I<00:03:48.060> mean<00:03:48.239> you<00:03:48.660> can

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
to say it to the video I mean you can

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.030 
to say it to the video I mean you can
see<00:03:48.989> that<00:03:49.260> there's<00:03:49.440> a<00:03:49.530> bit<00:03:49.709> of<00:03:49.739> bit<00:03:50.010> of

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
see that there's a bit of bit of

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.910 
see that there's a bit of bit of
improvement<00:03:50.810> great<00:03:51.810> with<00:03:52.170> the<00:03:52.290> frame<00:03:52.680> rates

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
improvement great with the frame rates

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.270 
improvement great with the frame rates
crash<00:03:53.459> I<00:03:53.610> add<00:03:53.760> more<00:03:54.030> drops<00:03:54.600> and<00:03:54.930> it<00:03:55.260> may<00:03:55.920> drop

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
crash I add more drops and it may drop

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.449 
crash I add more drops and it may drop
down<00:03:56.340> to<00:03:56.790> light<00:03:56.970> teal<00:03:57.209> low<00:03:58.170> 50s<00:03:58.709> but<00:03:59.160> then<00:03:59.310> it

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
down to light teal low 50s but then it

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.310 
down to light teal low 50s but then it
just<00:03:59.489> restabilizing<00:04:00.330> Mouse<00:04:00.660> back<00:04:00.870> up<00:04:01.080> so<00:04:01.290> I

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
just restabilizing Mouse back up so I

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.870 
just restabilizing Mouse back up so I
have<00:04:01.680> to<00:04:01.739> say<00:04:01.950> they<00:04:02.160> really<00:04:02.190> doesn't<00:04:02.700> do<00:04:02.790> a<00:04:02.820> lot

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
have to say they really doesn't do a lot

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.610 
have to say they really doesn't do a lot
overclock<00:04:03.360> just<00:04:03.630> a<00:04:03.750> little<00:04:04.080> bit<00:04:04.230> and<00:04:04.440> this

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
overclock just a little bit and this

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.500 
overclock just a little bit and this
video<00:04:04.950> just<00:04:05.160> kind<00:04:05.670> of<00:04:05.700> gone<00:04:05.850> this<00:04:06.090> part<00:04:06.360> just

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
video just kind of gone this part just

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.590 
video just kind of gone this part just
kind<00:04:06.540> of<00:04:07.410> didn't<00:04:07.620> go<00:04:07.739> long<00:04:07.950> and<00:04:08.480> things<00:04:09.480> like

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
kind of didn't go long and things like

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.390 
kind of didn't go long and things like
that<00:04:09.810> shot<00:04:10.019> the<00:04:10.170> ground<00:04:10.350> some<00:04:10.620> more<00:04:10.799> or<00:04:11.160> into

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
that shot the ground some more or into

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.430 
that shot the ground some more or into
the<00:04:11.549> same<00:04:11.790> plant<00:04:12.329> and<00:04:12.630> as<00:04:13.170> you<00:04:13.290> can<00:04:13.380> see

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
the same plant and as you can see

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.050 
the same plant and as you can see
actually<00:04:13.980> kept<00:04:14.190> up<00:04:14.370> whenever<00:04:14.670> into<00:04:14.940> that

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
actually kept up whenever into that

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.909 
actually kept up whenever into that
plane<00:04:15.239> as<00:04:15.360> well<00:04:15.510> went<00:04:16.350> to<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:16.620> same

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
plane as well went to the same

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.130 
plane as well went to the same
helicopter<00:04:17.609> now<00:04:17.820> in<00:04:18.090> this<00:04:18.479> clip<00:04:18.780> you<00:04:18.930> really

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
helicopter now in this clip you really

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.870 
helicopter now in this clip you really
can't<00:04:19.320> tell<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:19.560> difference<00:04:19.680> with<00:04:20.609> frame

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
can't tell the difference with frame

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.860 
can't tell the difference with frame
rates<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:21.359> things<00:04:21.630> like<00:04:21.870> that<00:04:22.109> because

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
rates and things like that because

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.270 
rates and things like that because
I<00:04:22.960> really<00:04:23.380> don't<00:04:23.470> know<00:04:23.620> why<00:04:23.770> I<00:04:23.800> could<00:04:23.979> if<00:04:24.100> not

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
I really don't know why I could if not

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.320 
I really don't know why I could if not
really<00:04:24.460> much<00:04:24.610> a<00:04:24.639> dent<00:04:24.940> when<00:04:25.060> I<00:04:25.120> was<00:04:25.210> in<00:04:25.270> a

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
really much a dent when I was in a

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.520 
really much a dent when I was in a
helicopter<00:04:25.419> I<00:04:25.900> guess<00:04:26.080> it's<00:04:26.260> just<00:04:26.410> too

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
helicopter I guess it's just too

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.129 
helicopter I guess it's just too
intensive<00:04:27.040> for<00:04:27.520> any<00:04:27.699> overclock<00:04:28.419> your<00:04:28.780> name

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
intensive for any overclock your name

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:31.830 
intensive for any overclock your name
anything<00:04:29.410> like<00:04:29.530> that<00:04:30.240> and<00:04:31.240> we<00:04:31.570> write<00:04:31.690> to<00:04:31.810> the

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
anything like that and we write to the

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.330 
anything like that and we write to the
same<00:04:31.930> water<00:04:32.410> and<00:04:33.540> there's<00:04:34.540> some<00:04:34.720> more

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
same water and there's some more

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.710 
same water and there's some more
particles<00:04:36.340> right<00:04:36.430> there<00:04:36.639> looking<00:04:37.300> at<00:04:37.419> same

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
particles right there looking at same

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.170 
particles right there looking at same
sky<00:04:38.110> it<00:04:38.650> didn't<00:04:38.889> get<00:04:38.979> as<00:04:39.100> high<00:04:39.220> as<00:04:39.550> I<00:04:40.030> thought

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
sky it didn't get as high as I thought

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.760 
sky it didn't get as high as I thought
it<00:04:40.360> would<00:04:40.510> be<00:04:40.630> I<00:04:40.660> guess<00:04:40.960> I<00:04:40.990> didn't<00:04:41.229> look<00:04:41.350> look

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
it would be I guess I didn't look look

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.920 
it would be I guess I didn't look look
straight<00:04:42.010> up<00:04:42.040> or<00:04:42.910> it<00:04:43.210> just<00:04:43.240> kind<00:04:43.780> of<00:04:43.810> got

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
straight up or it just kind of got

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.320 
straight up or it just kind of got
clouds<00:04:44.290> and<00:04:44.530> things<00:04:44.650> like<00:04:44.770> that<00:04:45.180> by<00:04:46.180> shooting

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
clouds and things like that by shooting

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.570 
clouds and things like that by shooting
at<00:04:46.510> the<00:04:46.540> ground<00:04:46.780> some<00:04:47.050> more<00:04:47.260> and<00:04:48.190> as<00:04:48.310> you<00:04:48.460> can

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
at the ground some more and as you can

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.740 
at the ground some more and as you can
see<00:04:48.639> I'm<00:04:48.880> not<00:04:49.030> really<00:04:49.180> good<00:04:49.419> to<00:04:49.479> find<00:04:49.690> a

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
see I'm not really good to find a

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.000 
see I'm not really good to find a
helicopter<00:04:50.350> because<00:04:50.530> I'm<00:04:50.740> not<00:04:50.860> really

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
helicopter because I'm not really

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.030 
helicopter because I'm not really
stabilized<00:04:51.729> singing<00:04:52.090> things<00:04:52.270> like<00:04:52.449> that

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
stabilized singing things like that

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.439

looking<00:04:54.040> at<00:04:54.130> flowers<00:04:54.310> again<00:04:54.760> and<00:04:55.060> when<00:04:55.330> old

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:55.449 
looking at flowers again and when old

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:57.719 
looking at flowers again and when old
it's<00:04:55.630> 100<00:04:56.050> this<00:04:56.199> time<00:04:56.440> autumn<00:04:57.280> clouds<00:04:57.460> and

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729 
it's 100 this time autumn clouds and

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:00.840 
it's 100 this time autumn clouds and
particle<00:04:58.030> effects<00:04:58.360> and<00:04:59.229> me<00:05:00.130> shooting<00:05:00.460> at<00:05:00.669> the

particle effects and me shooting at the

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.230 
particle effects and me shooting at the
building<00:05:02.130> like<00:05:03.130> I<00:05:03.160> say<00:05:03.310> it's<00:05:03.460> just<00:05:03.520> a<00:05:03.789> basic

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
building like I say it's just a basic

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.420 
building like I say it's just a basic
loop<00:05:04.419> you<00:05:04.570> can<00:05:04.720> see<00:05:04.840> on<00:05:04.990> the<00:05:05.139> top<00:05:05.830> hook<00:05:06.070> you<00:05:06.370> can

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
loop you can see on the top hook you can

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.070 
loop you can see on the top hook you can
see<00:05:06.580> on<00:05:06.669> the<00:05:06.729> top<00:05:06.910> right<00:05:06.940> corner<00:05:07.449> about<00:05:07.780> the

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
see on the top right corner about the

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.480 
see on the top right corner about the
frame<00:05:08.289> rate<00:05:08.530> still<00:05:08.710> attained<00:05:09.010> there's<00:05:09.280> me

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
frame rate still attained there's me

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.719 
frame rate still attained there's me
building<00:05:09.910> up<00:05:09.970> the<00:05:10.060> helicopter<00:05:11.250> all<00:05:12.250> right<00:05:12.490> and

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
building up the helicopter all right and

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.340 
building up the helicopter all right and
you<00:05:12.940> can<00:05:13.030> see<00:05:13.060> we<00:05:13.270> stay<00:05:13.419> well<00:05:13.570> lift<00:05:13.960> stabilized

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
you can see we stay well lift stabilized

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:15.570 
you can see we stay well lift stabilized
I'll<00:05:14.500> pretty<00:05:14.710> much<00:05:14.770> all<00:05:14.979> way<00:05:15.070> back<00:05:15.250> to<00:05:15.490> the

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
I'll pretty much all way back to the

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.520 
I'll pretty much all way back to the
upper<00:05:15.880> to<00:05:16.240> the<00:05:16.360> 16<00:05:16.750> I<00:05:16.960> see<00:05:17.169> we're<00:05:17.289> going<00:05:17.380> back

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
upper to the 16 I see we're going back

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.200 
upper to the 16 I see we're going back
to<00:05:17.620> the<00:05:17.680> 50s<00:05:18.010> now<00:05:18.190> come<00:05:18.880> right<00:05:18.910> to<00:05:19.180> the

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
to the 50s now come right to the

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.390 
to the 50s now come right to the
vegetation<00:05:19.930> and<00:05:20.320> when<00:05:21.100> you<00:05:21.190> want<00:05:21.340> your

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
vegetation and when you want your

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.980 
vegetation and when you want your
vegetation<00:05:21.910> you<00:05:21.940> know<00:05:22.120> all<00:05:22.270> the<00:05:22.419> very<00:05:22.630> crafts

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
vegetation you know all the very crafts

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.390 
vegetation you know all the very crafts
and<00:05:23.139> stuff<00:05:23.199> like<00:05:23.350> that<00:05:23.500> you're<00:05:23.650> gonna<00:05:23.770> pretty

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
and stuff like that you're gonna pretty

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.100 
and stuff like that you're gonna pretty
much<00:05:24.520> almost<00:05:24.850> kill<00:05:25.300> you<00:05:25.419> grab<00:05:25.570> scar<00:05:25.840> but<00:05:25.990> yeah

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
much almost kill you grab scar but yeah

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.020 
much almost kill you grab scar but yeah
as<00:05:26.229> you<00:05:26.320> can<00:05:26.380> see<00:05:26.470> right<00:05:26.740> there<00:05:27.010> and<00:05:27.280> me<00:05:27.520> we<00:05:27.669> we

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
as you can see right there and me we we

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.540 
as you can see right there and me we we
stay<00:05:28.240> above<00:05:28.510> 50<00:05:28.750> FPS<00:05:29.620> cuz<00:05:29.830> that's<00:05:29.950> pretty<00:05:30.130> good

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
stay above 50 FPS cuz that's pretty good

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.379 
stay above 50 FPS cuz that's pretty good
alright<00:05:31.539> so<00:05:31.780> my<00:05:32.770> thoughts<00:05:33.039> I<00:05:33.430> was

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:34.389 
alright so my thoughts I was

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:37.710 
alright so my thoughts I was
overclocking<00:05:35.289> and<00:05:35.470> things<00:05:36.010> like<00:05:36.160> that<00:05:36.220> I<00:05:36.720> say

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
overclocking and things like that I say

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.159 
overclocking and things like that I say
is<00:05:37.840> pretty<00:05:38.080> well<00:05:38.260> worth<00:05:38.560> it<00:05:39.539> however<00:05:40.539> if<00:05:40.900> you

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
is pretty well worth it however if you

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:42.900 
is pretty well worth it however if you
really<00:05:41.530> pay<00:05:41.830> attention<00:05:41.860> to<00:05:42.310> both<00:05:42.490> clips

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
really pay attention to both clips

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.640 
really pay attention to both clips
there's<00:05:43.300> not<00:05:43.479> really<00:05:43.660> much<00:05:43.900> of<00:05:43.960> a<00:05:44.139> difference

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
there's not really much of a difference

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.800 
there's not really much of a difference
of<00:05:45.250> performance<00:05:46.090> I<00:05:46.150> probably<00:05:46.360> got<00:05:46.539> a<00:05:46.599> little

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
of performance I probably got a little

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.420 
of performance I probably got a little
bit<00:05:46.930> more<00:05:47.139> performance<00:05:47.289> than<00:05:47.650> usual<00:05:48.099> in<00:05:48.280> which

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
bit more performance than usual in which

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.640 
bit more performance than usual in which
I<00:05:48.580> wish<00:05:48.940> I<00:05:49.060> welcome<00:05:49.450> I<00:05:49.570> welcome<00:05:50.050> all<00:05:50.229> the<00:05:50.470> time

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
I wish I welcome I welcome all the time

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.520 
I wish I welcome I welcome all the time
but<00:05:51.660> like<00:05:52.660> I<00:05:52.750> say<00:05:52.870> its<00:05:53.050> properties<00:05:53.410> not

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
but like I say its properties not

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.140 
but like I say its properties not
worried<00:05:53.800> I<00:05:53.889> practice<00:05:54.250> kept<00:05:54.760> a<00:05:54.789> tight<00:05:54.940> stop

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.150 
worried I practice kept a tight stop

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.120 
worried I practice kept a tight stop
