you

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.290 

well<00:02:11.190> that<00:02:11.430> was<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.670> first<00:02:11.880> time<00:02:12.000> i've<00:02:12.120> done

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
well that was the first time i've done

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.490 
well that was the first time i've done
it<00:02:12.420> while<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.690> float<00:02:12.990> and<00:02:13.290> i<00:02:14.280> have<00:02:14.459> to<00:02:14.610> say<00:02:15.500> not

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
it while the float and i have to say not

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.520 
it while the float and i have to say not
that<00:02:16.530> ad<00:02:17.660> it's<00:02:18.660> not<00:02:18.810> sort<00:02:19.020> of<00:02:19.110> thing<00:02:19.290> that<00:02:19.319> you

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
that ad it's not sort of thing that you

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.110 
that ad it's not sort of thing that you
could<00:02:19.620> do<00:02:19.770> on<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:19.890> river<00:02:20.130> between<00:02:20.370> bridges<00:02:20.970> in

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
could do on a river between bridges in

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.490 
could do on a river between bridges in
fact<00:02:21.300> I'm<00:02:21.390> not<00:02:21.420> even<00:02:21.569> sure<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:21.930> I<00:02:22.110> could<00:02:22.230> do

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
fact I'm not even sure that I could do

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.070 
fact I'm not even sure that I could do
it<00:02:22.620> out<00:02:23.280> on<00:02:23.459> my<00:02:23.610> little<00:02:23.850> mooring<00:02:24.209> so<00:02:24.569> it<00:02:24.870> really

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
it out on my little mooring so it really

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.020 
it out on my little mooring so it really
needs<00:02:25.319> to<00:02:25.380> be<00:02:25.470> done<00:02:25.709> somewhere<00:02:26.160> really<00:02:26.400> quiet

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
needs to be done somewhere really quiet

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.270 
needs to be done somewhere really quiet
and<00:02:27.150> secure<00:02:27.680> well<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:28.709> could<00:02:28.860> do<00:02:28.950> a<00:02:28.980> ground

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
and secure well I could do a ground

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.520 
and secure well I could do a ground
course<00:02:29.640> I<00:02:29.940> could<00:02:30.090> just<00:02:30.209> run<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.050> boat<00:02:31.200> up<00:02:31.380> on

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
course I could just run the boat up on

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.340 
course I could just run the boat up on
the<00:02:31.709> mud<00:02:32.190> somewhere<00:02:32.459> I'm<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.790> rising<00:02:33.150> tide<00:02:33.360> to

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
the mud somewhere I'm a rising tide to

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.680 
the mud somewhere I'm a rising tide to
do<00:02:34.470> it<00:02:34.819> it<00:02:35.819> should<00:02:35.970> be<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.090> sensible<00:02:36.420> thing<00:02:36.569> to

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
do it it should be the sensible thing to

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.930 
do it it should be the sensible thing to
do<00:02:36.900> that<00:02:37.650> was<00:02:37.800> quite<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.100> lot<00:02:38.280> of<00:02:38.310> work<00:02:38.520> so

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
do that was quite a lot of work so

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.610 
do that was quite a lot of work so
really<00:02:39.180> if<00:02:39.690> you're<00:02:39.780> gonna<00:02:39.900> do<00:02:40.050> canal<00:02:40.320> stuff

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
really if you're gonna do canal stuff

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.729 
really if you're gonna do canal stuff
you<00:02:41.010> need<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:41.190> have<00:02:41.370> it<00:02:41.489> dropped<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:43.410> we'll

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
you need to have it dropped and we'll

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:53.740 
you need to have it dropped and we'll
see<00:02:43.920> whether<00:02:44.100> this<00:02:44.280> type<00:02:44.519> of<00:02:44.550> thing<00:02:44.790> works<00:02:47.780> ok

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.630 

sail<00:02:54.750> down<00:02:55.019> kind<00:02:55.860> of<00:02:55.920> stowed<00:02:56.160> it<00:02:56.340> we<00:02:56.430> all<00:02:56.489> right

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
sail down kind of stowed it we all right

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:05.780 
sail down kind of stowed it we all right
and<00:02:57.480> so<00:02:57.870> there's<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.230> well<00:03:04.340> they're<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.610> much

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
and so there's the well they're the much

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.110 
and so there's the well they're the much
sparse<00:03:06.410> so<00:03:07.410> got<00:03:08.100> to<00:03:08.220> make<00:03:08.370> something<00:03:08.700> which<00:03:09.030> is

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
sparse so got to make something which is

00:03:09.120 --> 00:06:32.850 
sparse so got to make something which is
going<00:03:09.209> to<00:03:09.269> hold<00:03:09.480> that

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:32.860 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.439 

so<00:06:35.189> slightly<00:06:36.189> unconventional<00:06:36.759> very

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:37.449 
so slightly unconventional very

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:41.899 
so slightly unconventional very
unconventional<00:06:38.969> so<00:06:39.969> i<00:06:40.000> made<00:06:40.509> a<00:06:40.539> math<00:06:40.840> step

00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:41.909 
unconventional so i made a math step

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:46.110 
unconventional so i made a math step
this<00:06:42.909> is<00:06:43.060> mark<00:06:43.300> one<00:06:43.509> mile<00:06:43.750> step<00:06:44.050> a<00:06:45.030> mark<00:06:46.030> to

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:46.120 
this is mark one mile step a mark to

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.920 
this is mark one mile step a mark to
might<00:06:46.509> be<00:06:46.659> long<00:06:46.840> but<00:06:47.759> this<00:06:48.759> works<00:06:49.060> and<00:06:49.389> that's

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:49.930 
might be long but this works and that's

00:06:49.930 --> 00:07:00.749 
might be long but this works and that's
fine<00:06:52.800> and<00:06:55.530> that<00:06:56.530> will<00:06:56.830> allow<00:06:57.340> me<00:06:57.610> to<00:06:59.759> sail

00:07:00.749 --> 00:07:00.759 
fine and that will allow me to sail

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:05.490 
fine and that will allow me to sail
along<00:07:01.060> rivers<00:07:02.580> it's<00:07:03.580> an<00:07:03.699> old<00:07:03.879> topper<00:07:04.569> training

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:05.500 
along rivers it's an old topper training

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:15.800 
along rivers it's an old topper training
mast<00:07:11.669> and<00:07:12.669> it's<00:07:13.000> old<00:07:13.389> bit<00:07:13.569> supply<00:07:14.020> and

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:15.810 
mast and it's old bit supply and

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.969 
mast and it's old bit supply and
actually<00:07:16.810> it's<00:07:16.900> a<00:07:16.990> remains<00:07:17.289> of<00:07:17.409> the<00:07:17.469> duck<00:07:17.680> pump

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:17.979 
actually it's a remains of the duck pump

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:26.129 
actually it's a remains of the duck pump
frames<00:07:18.310> and<00:07:22.259> screws<00:07:23.259> no<00:07:24.159> glue<00:07:24.779> I'll<00:07:25.779> see<00:07:25.990> how<00:07:26.110> I

00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:26.139 
frames and screws no glue I'll see how I

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:28.379 
frames and screws no glue I'll see how I
get<00:07:26.319> on<00:07:26.349> fire<00:07:27.009> if<00:07:27.310> it<00:07:27.430> works<00:07:27.639> that's<00:07:27.939> great<00:07:28.210> if

00:07:28.379 --> 00:07:28.389 
get on fire if it works that's great if

00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:31.170 
get on fire if it works that's great if
it<00:07:28.509> doesn't<00:07:28.779> well<00:07:29.669> nothing<00:07:30.669> ventured<00:07:30.699> nothing

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:31.180 
it doesn't well nothing ventured nothing

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:36.959 
it doesn't well nothing ventured nothing
gained<00:07:34.259> if<00:07:35.259> it<00:07:35.439> means<00:07:35.620> I'm<00:07:35.860> just<00:07:36.159> drop<00:07:36.430> it<00:07:36.639> to

00:07:36.959 --> 00:07:36.969 
gained if it means I'm just drop it to

00:07:36.969 --> 00:07:39.020 
gained if it means I'm just drop it to
