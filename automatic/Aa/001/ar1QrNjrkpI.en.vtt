just show you this in comparison to the

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.479 
just show you this in comparison to the
almighty<00:00:45.120> ipad<00:00:45.780> 4<00:00:46.079> at<00:00:46.170> one<00:00:46.350> point<00:00:46.530> for<00:00:46.920> which

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
almighty ipad 4 at one point for which

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.500 
almighty ipad 4 at one point for which
scores<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.940> geekbench<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.770> 1757<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:50.579> this

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
scores a geekbench of 1757 so this

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.369 
scores a geekbench of 1757 so this
tablet<00:00:52.110> with<00:00:52.230> its<00:00:52.379> Exynos<00:00:52.860> 5<00:00:53.070> 250<00:00:53.840> cpu<00:00:54.840> wise<00:00:55.079> is

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
tablet with its Exynos 5 250 cpu wise is

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.040 
tablet with its Exynos 5 250 cpu wise is
wiping<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.070> floor<00:00:56.280> with<00:00:56.510> the<00:00:58.219> ipad<00:00:59.219> 4<00:01:00.050> so

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
wiping the floor with the ipad 4 so

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.650 
wiping the floor with the ipad 4 so
that's<00:01:01.260> very<00:01:01.530> interesting<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:02.219> see<00:01:02.430> there<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
that's very interesting to see there the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.750 
that's very interesting to see there the
CPU<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.290> definitely<00:01:04.739> better<00:01:04.890> on<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:05.460> device

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
CPU is definitely better on this device

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.630 
CPU is definitely better on this device
than<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.299> on<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.720> iPad<00:01:07.140> let's<00:01:07.890> now<00:01:08.310> go

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
than it is on the iPad let's now go

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.270 
than it is on the iPad let's now go
ahead<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.210> check<00:01:09.420> out<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:10.140> GL<00:01:10.470> benchmark<00:01:10.680> and

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
ahead and check out the GL benchmark and

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.770 
ahead and check out the GL benchmark and
this<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.820> going<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.060> test<00:01:12.270> out<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.689> GPU<00:01:14.150> of<00:01:15.150> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
this is going to test out the GPU of the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.480 
this is going to test out the GPU of the
device<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.380> then<00:01:16.740> we<00:01:16.890> can<00:01:17.040> see<00:01:17.220> if<00:01:17.250> it's<00:01:17.369> any

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
device and then we can see if it's any

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.320 
device and then we can see if it's any
better<00:01:17.700> what<00:01:18.000> I'm<00:01:18.119> going<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.360> do<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.840> do<00:01:19.110> the

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
better what I'm going to do is do the

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.450 
better what I'm going to do is do the
Egypt<00:01:21.330> HD<00:01:21.810> ones<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.439> then<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.650> eejit<00:01:22.950> classic

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
Egypt HD ones and then the eejit classic

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.190 
Egypt HD ones and then the eejit classic
and<00:01:23.670> I'm<00:01:24.119> going<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.299> compare<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.930> the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
and I'm going to compare that to the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.320 
and I'm going to compare that to the
ipad<00:01:25.530> 4<00:01:25.890> i'm<00:01:26.430> not<00:01:26.610> going<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.790> bother<00:01:26.939> doing<00:01:27.150> the

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
ipad 4 i'm not going to bother doing the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.149 
ipad 4 i'm not going to bother doing the
fill<00:01:27.540> rate<00:01:27.780> stuff<00:01:28.049> because<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.799> know<00:01:28.890> i<00:01:28.920> don't

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
fill rate stuff because you know i don't

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.880 
fill rate stuff because you know i don't
even<00:01:29.280> really<00:01:29.579> know<00:01:29.759> what<00:01:29.880> they<00:01:29.970> need<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:30.890> on

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
even really know what they need so on

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.440 
even really know what they need so on
screen<00:01:32.220> knocking<00:01:32.610> at<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.150> go<00:01:33.240> ahead<00:01:33.329> and

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
screen knocking at it and go ahead and

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.990 
screen knocking at it and go ahead and
click<00:01:33.630> start<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:34.650> does<00:01:35.100> take<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.460> long<00:01:35.700> time

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
click start this does take a long time

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.109 
click start this does take a long time
so<00:01:36.509> i'm<00:01:36.840> going<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.020> go<00:01:37.079> ahead<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.770> skip<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.970> the

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
so i'm going to go ahead and skip to the

ipad<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.649> gets<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:08.129> 50<00:02:08.640> 1.8<00:02:09.360> on<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:10.530> next<00:02:10.830> one

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
ipad it gets a 50 1.8 on the next one

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.950 
ipad it gets a 50 1.8 on the next one
the<00:02:11.370> nexus<00:02:11.760> 10<00:02:12.540> gets<00:02:12.780> there

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
the nexus 10 gets there

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.610 
the nexus 10 gets there
a six<00:02:13.350> the<00:02:13.740> iPad<00:02:14.100> gets<00:02:14.450> 42.1<00:02:15.450> so<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.350> can<00:02:16.470> see

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
a six the iPad gets 42.1 so you can see

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.970 
a six the iPad gets 42.1 so you can see
the<00:02:16.740> ipad<00:02:16.890> is<00:02:17.220> just<00:02:17.460> being<00:02:17.850> in<00:02:18.150> every<00:02:18.600> test<00:02:18.980> so

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
the ipad is just being in every test so

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.190 
the ipad is just being in every test so
far<00:02:20.370> both<00:02:20.760> of<00:02:20.970> them<00:02:21.060> are<00:02:21.210> not<00:02:21.330> supported<00:02:21.870> here

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
far both of them are not supported here

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.710 
far both of them are not supported here
this<00:02:25.200> test<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.770> nexus<00:02:26.130> 10<00:02:26.310> gets<00:02:26.490> 23<00:02:26.970> here<00:02:27.390> it

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
this test the nexus 10 gets 23 here it

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.890 
this test the nexus 10 gets 23 here it
gets<00:02:27.960> 37<00:02:28.860> if<00:02:29.580> we<00:02:29.730> go<00:02:29.880> in<00:02:30.030> ahead<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:30.510> hit<00:02:30.720> the

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
frames per second on the ipad 4 so you

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.610 
frames per second on the ipad 4 so you
can<00:02:55.470> quite<00:02:55.800> clearly<00:02:55.830> see<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:56.550> ipad<00:02:56.940> 4<00:02:57.540> has<00:02:58.260> it

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
can quite clearly see the ipad 4 has it

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.110 
can quite clearly see the ipad 4 has it
just<00:02:58.920> has<00:02:59.130> a<00:02:59.160> stronger<00:03:01.490> GPU<00:03:02.490> I<00:03:02.520> mean<00:03:02.850> the

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
just has a stronger GPU I mean the

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.060 
just has a stronger GPU I mean the
resolution<00:03:03.750> is<00:03:03.930> slightly<00:03:04.320> higher<00:03:04.470> on<00:03:04.890> here

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
resolution is slightly higher on here

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.890 
resolution is slightly higher on here
but<00:03:05.250> that's<00:03:05.400> what<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.730> off<00:03:05.880> screen<00:03:06.240> tests<00:03:06.780> are

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
but that's what the off screen tests are

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.600 
but that's what the off screen tests are
for<00:03:06.930> so<00:03:07.650> if<00:03:07.710> we<00:03:07.770> take<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:08.130> bottom<00:03:08.430> one<00:03:08.580> the

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
for so if we take the bottom one the

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.340 
for so if we take the bottom one the
eighty<00:03:08.850> seven<00:03:09.300> frames<00:03:09.450> per<00:03:09.660> second<00:03:10.020> the<00:03:10.080> iPad

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
eighty seven frames per second the iPad

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.960 
eighty seven frames per second the iPad
gets<00:03:10.530> 132<00:03:11.310> point<00:03:11.580> seven<00:03:12.980> you<00:03:13.980> can<00:03:14.190> see<00:03:14.520> that

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
gets 132 point seven you can see that

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.870 
gets 132 point seven you can see that
the<00:03:15.270> ipad<00:03:15.450> for<00:03:16.170> GPU<00:03:16.800> is<00:03:16.950> just<00:03:17.490> stronger

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
the ipad for GPU is just stronger

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.230 
the ipad for GPU is just stronger
there's<00:03:18.090> no<00:03:18.240> two<00:03:18.450> ways<00:03:18.480> about<00:03:18.780> it<00:03:19.400> and<00:03:20.400> in

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
there's no two ways about it and in

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.780 
there's no two ways about it and in
total<00:03:21.780> that<00:03:22.500> means<00:03:22.800> it's<00:03:22.980> actually<00:03:23.400> one<00:03:23.640> or

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
total that means it's actually one or

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.870 
total that means it's actually one or
because<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.420> nexus<00:03:25.110> 10<00:03:25.380> cpu<00:03:26.070> which<00:03:26.460> is<00:03:26.610> a<00:03:26.640> lot

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
because the nexus 10 cpu which is a lot

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.910 
because the nexus 10 cpu which is a lot
stronger<00:03:27.150> than<00:03:27.330> the<00:03:27.510> ipad<00:03:27.870> force<00:03:28.170> we<00:03:28.500> saw<00:03:28.740> that

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
stronger than the ipad force we saw that

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.730 
stronger than the ipad force we saw that
in<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.070> Geekbench<00:03:29.400> result<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.270> in<00:03:31.200> this<00:03:31.410> test

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 
in the Geekbench result and in this test

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.790 
in the Geekbench result and in this test
we're<00:03:32.040> seeing<00:03:32.370> that<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:33.350> GPU<00:03:34.350> is<00:03:34.380> a<00:03:34.560> lot

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
we're seeing that the GPU is a lot

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.980 
we're seeing that the GPU is a lot
stronger<00:03:35.100> in<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.550> ipad<00:03:35.940> 4<00:03:36.270> than<00:03:36.540> it<00:03:36.660> is<00:03:36.750> in<00:03:36.930> the

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
stronger in the ipad 4 than it is in the

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.740 
stronger in the ipad 4 than it is in the
nexus<00:03:37.350> 10<00:03:37.740> so<00:03:38.610> you<00:03:39.540> know<00:03:39.690> it's<00:03:40.020> one<00:03:40.350> or<00:03:40.530> and

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
nexus 10 so you know it's one or and

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.860 
nexus 10 so you know it's one or and
there<00:03:42.750> you<00:03:42.840> go<00:03:42.900> I<00:03:43.800> mean<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:44.820> ipad<00:03:45.120> 4<00:03:45.360> is<00:03:45.540> well

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
there you go I mean the ipad 4 is well

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.050 
there you go I mean the ipad 4 is well
above<00:03:46.140> everything<00:03:46.680> I<00:03:47.100> mean<00:03:47.400> on<00:03:47.580> this<00:03:47.790> sheet<00:03:48.030> of

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
above everything I mean on this sheet of

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.810 
above everything I mean on this sheet of
paper<00:03:48.360> axis<00:03:48.990> there<00:03:49.470> on<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.830> GL<00:03:50.070> benchmarks

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
paper axis there on the GL benchmarks

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.360 
paper axis there on the GL benchmarks
the<00:03:51.270> ipad<00:03:51.660> 4<00:03:51.900> is<00:03:52.050> top<00:03:52.290> of<00:03:52.320> the<00:03:52.500> list<00:03:52.680> number<00:03:52.950> one

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
the ipad 4 is top of the list number one

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.080 
the ipad 4 is top of the list number one
and<00:03:53.810> the<00:03:54.980> nexus<00:03:55.980> 10<00:03:56.190> is<00:03:56.400> number<00:03:56.700> two<00:03:56.910> in<00:03:56.940> the

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
and the nexus 10 is number two in the

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.460 
and the nexus 10 is number two in the
list<00:03:57.360> so<00:03:57.750> this<00:03:58.020> is<00:03:58.050> the<00:03:58.470> second<00:03:58.980> best<00:03:59.400> results

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
list so this is the second best results
