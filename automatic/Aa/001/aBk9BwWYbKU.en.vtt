year<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.520> already<00:00:59.520> tracking<00:01:00.449> rotation<00:01:01.170> which

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
year is already tracking rotation which

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.889 
year is already tracking rotation which
means<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.160> are<00:01:02.280> more<00:01:02.850> specializing<00:01:03.750> in

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
groups are not that T then I think in

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.820

our<00:01:27.400> university<00:01:28.400> the<00:01:28.640> students<00:01:29.090> actually

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
our university the students actually

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.280 
our university the students actually
have<00:01:30.830> the<00:01:30.950> possibility<00:01:31.490> to<00:01:31.670> do<00:01:32.600> more<00:01:32.960> things

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
have the possibility to do more things

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:47.550 
have the possibility to do more things
than<00:01:33.680> in<00:01:34.060> many<00:01:35.140> larger<00:01:36.140> vet<00:01:37.100> schools
