00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.730
 channel sponsor thermaltake 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:08.730
 thermaltake play even easier 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:11.370
 Hello everyone, I'm Masha and this is a techno kitchen 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.400
 long time ago we had no collection of computers and 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.010
 we decided to fill this gap let's 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.570
 we will collect the game machine 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.390
 the goal is to get the maximum 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.820
 opportunities for money invested so 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.080
 let's see what is important now and how 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.119
 things start let's start with the processor i5 44 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.189
 40 is weak for you 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.040
 but for us it covers needs 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.570
 modern graphics cards besides its 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.120
 can be overclocked by bus 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.960
 in games processors are not loaded on 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.440
 full power so the system doesn't matter 4770 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.989
 key you or 4440 difference often 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.840
 is not more than four fps in 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.390
 heavy modes like to see 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.300
 on the third generation but at a cost she 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.899
 same with the fourth so you want not 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:04.860
 you want a socket 1150 now only 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.450
 way out many curse us for dislike fx 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.780
 8350 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.909
 however , emden processors even overclocking 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.740
 that chew stock can't overtake 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.740
 initial and 5 without overclocking 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:28.500
 further the motherboard choice is rich here 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.770
 we wrapped on some beauty from and 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.820
 weight but attention it supports 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.460
 crossfire only 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.780
 which means we will be tied by hands if 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.190
 we want to deliver 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:44.400
 Alla is nothing better than asrock z87 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:48.840
 extreme3 did not come up supported and 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:51.090
 cross with allah and the formula 88 is that 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:56.280
 one hundred percent reveals the needs 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:02:00.300
 all video cards but also the smile of the season r9 290 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:03.110
 from asus for only 14 thousand rubles 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.700
 summer calm has fallen magically 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.220
 dual slot wild card will pull all 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.709
 games on ultra + fourfold 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.100
 smoothing plus and full hd 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.620
 and often and more Chefoo hd future 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.920
 you can add a second card and it will be 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:23.310
 a bomb is more profitable to take a memory capacity of 8 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:27.000
 they 4 gigabytes take two dies and 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.750
 there will be 16 gigabytes many chasing 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.830
 clean 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:34.799
 it is for nothing our 1600 megahertz 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.530
 you can overclock too though it makes no sense 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.190
 had the idea to take a powerful power supply under 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.670
 future 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.690
 however if you add the second 290 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.049
 replace 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:49.260
 and the power supply just suddenly you 1 290 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:52.019
 enough for a long time in general a beautiful model 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.709
 from the z axis with a capacity of 600 watts 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:58.920
 while it suits us choosing the case 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:01.590
 we focus on terr valtec they have a lot 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.170
 models, almost everything looks 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.989
 ugly but one beautiful we 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:10.140
 watched from our review the length under 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.150
 video card 29 centimeters length 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.620
 video card chosen by us twenty 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:19.230
 eight and seven centimeters fit just 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:22.290
 Further solid, but you probably will die 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.390
 spend 6 thousand on the drive therefore not 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.209
 we will injure you and cleanly under 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.280
 we will select 120 and gigabyte 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:33.040
 model 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:36.620
 2 terabytes for games and trash as file 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.390
 always forgot optima cooler handle and 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.600
 cool the processor in silence 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.240
 even if we do it on the bus with overclocking 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.910
 In general, for 41 thousand rubles we received 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.520
 modern powerful fast gaming 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.340
 a computer that will pull all the games in 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:56.360
 over the coming years and if you add 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:59.690
 second such that 290 five years 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.269
 enough and give the owner pleasure 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.420
 the system is good because you can 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:09.050
 install one or two 780 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.620
 if you really do n’t like Andy 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.640
 Maria 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.920
 all for now and what if you don’t have 40 thousand 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.070
 rubles and you want to add only 20

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.400
