00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.540 
but I think get the shape I want and

clay<00:02:04.910> over<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:05.450> top<00:02:05.690> of<00:02:05.720> it<00:02:06.080> this<00:02:06.590> was<00:02:06.860> one

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
clay over the top of it this was one

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.529 
clay over the top of it this was one
that<00:02:07.340> I<00:02:07.460> decided<00:02:07.940> it<00:02:08.119> would<00:02:08.269> change

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
that I decided it would change

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.800 
that I decided it would change
directions<00:02:09.050> so<00:02:09.560> I<00:02:09.619> just<00:02:09.830> cut<00:02:10.280> off<00:02:10.399> the<00:02:10.820> fish's

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
directions so I just cut off the fish's

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.410 
directions so I just cut off the fish's
head<00:02:11.990> and<00:02:12.380> did<00:02:13.010> something<00:02:13.400> else<00:02:13.550> with<00:02:13.880> it<00:02:13.910> but

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
head and did something else with it but

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.700 
head and did something else with it but
anyway<00:02:14.540> you<00:02:14.810> can<00:02:15.080> see

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
anyway you can see

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.570 
anyway you can see

hot glue glues together pieces of

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.540 
hot glue glues together pieces of
styrofoam<00:02:41.830> wonderful<00:02:42.830> it's<00:02:43.040> gonna<00:02:43.220> be<00:02:43.340> low

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
styrofoam wonderful it's gonna be low

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.180 
styrofoam wonderful it's gonna be low

I've got one of these things that people
use<00:03:04.400> with<00:03:05.360> Oh

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
use with Oh

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.160 
use with Oh
polymer<00:03:07.580> clay<00:03:07.810> and<00:03:08.950> it<00:03:09.950> works<00:03:10.280> great<00:03:10.900> to<00:03:11.900> roll

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
polymer clay and it works great to roll

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.860 
polymer clay and it works great to roll
out<00:03:12.440> that<00:03:12.770> paper<00:03:13.040> clay<00:03:13.400> I<00:03:13.730> didn't<00:03:14.240> I've<00:03:14.570> never

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
out that paper clay I didn't I've never

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:15.730 
out that paper clay I didn't I've never
thought<00:03:15.140> of<00:03:15.200> that

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
thought of that

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.940 
thought of that
so<00:03:16.490> I'll<00:03:16.910> spritz<00:03:17.510> this<00:03:17.660> get<00:03:17.930> a<00:03:17.960> little<00:03:18.410> barely

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
so I'll spritz this get a little barely

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.840 
so I'll spritz this get a little barely
damp<00:03:19.220> and<00:03:19.640> then<00:03:20.390> roll<00:03:20.660> it<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:21.110> on<00:03:21.350> and<00:03:21.770> it<00:03:22.550> just

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
damp and then roll it and on and it just

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.510 
damp and then roll it and on and it just
worked<00:03:23.120> wonderful<00:03:24.080> and<00:03:24.320> then<00:03:24.920> I<00:03:24.950> can<00:03:25.280> get<00:03:25.400> it

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
worked wonderful and then I can get it

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.300 
worked wonderful and then I can get it
thickness<00:03:26.120> I<00:03:26.300> want<00:03:26.570> to<00:03:26.780> pick<00:03:26.989> it<00:03:27.140> up<00:03:27.260> a<00:03:27.650> flat

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
thickness I want to pick it up a flat

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.270 
thickness I want to pick it up a flat
piece<00:03:28.640> and<00:03:29.090> just<00:03:29.870> go<00:03:30.170> around<00:03:30.290> instead<00:03:31.160> of

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
piece and just go around instead of

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.490 
piece and just go around instead of
taking<00:03:31.640> little<00:03:31.850> bitty<00:03:32.330> pieces<00:03:32.660> and<00:03:33.650> having<00:03:34.489> to

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
taking little bitty pieces and having to

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.080 
taking little bitty pieces and having to
spread<00:03:36.500> them<00:03:36.620> around<00:03:36.770> works<00:03:37.730> a<00:03:37.910> lot<00:03:38.030> faster

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
spread them around works a lot faster

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.800 
spread them around works a lot faster
for<00:03:38.780> me<00:03:39.200> that's<00:03:40.160> paper<00:03:40.610> clay<00:03:41.000> that's<00:03:41.420> bent<00:03:41.690> out

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810
