00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.340
 so too idiot 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.890
 today again a very small thing here as the camera apologizes please 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:11.149
 there it is true and what he does where it is not 

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:12.879
 around 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.240
 I said I would like to try it out or have a look here 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.220
 the games run on the cot 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.449
 but I just lose time on Wednesday in Madrid year it is it 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.039
 regrettably already 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.949
 Percent of much of our hard drive capacity now we have 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.529
 just three Kommer 7 re-election available 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.880
 that's not the world Â» 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.860
 the next problem there is also some luck tickets for Herrmann overcome 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.810
 external is dvd drives loser 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.280
 now I have still way to add something on tour and pork belly 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.610
 connect 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.810
 there is the car is no usb-3 0 2 him 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.050
 Now I have to get there fast 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.530
 Not the Way Kreke 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.170
 worried and I'll show you how the stories go 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.610
 Wietfeld is running 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.700
 Art which currently has all the drivers installed AR We also have the 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.140
 Print and driver installed 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.000
 who else really? 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.960
 yes really funny 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.960
 CI plus module high 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.040
 Son the media settings no game flow like 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.040
 not in full screen mode 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.550
 he has the possible extension Paris Sosa available 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.860
 then I'll do a quick start 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.490
 Something does not matter the match 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.490
 play there 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.440
 his by the time briefly so on the radio keyboard so should not be synonymous 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.390
 optimal but I think for now the scepter lead 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.020
 Percent all settings is still low and also 16 reference color depth 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.920
 and that works 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.130
 you can also spared in playing yes it is 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.130
 so the ultimate experience here 

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:12.719
 But it works 

00:02:25.029 --> 00:02:27.909
 because you can even decorate relatively well SGE 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:30.769
 clarify very finely 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.769
 so 

00:02:34.499 --> 00:02:39.219
 So that's so cumbersome at 2004 yes percent if you're there now something 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:41.119
 would like to play something newer 

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:43.009
 then you can send that, of course 

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:45.659
 or percent 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:48.949
 Come on the Concorso reader to the running world for yourself I'm early 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:52.089
 ultimately not having to reinstall a game for each time 

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:55.349
 to discuss the other game before the Israeli percent 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.349
 because of the lack of hard disk capacity yes 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:59.869
 around 

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:00.760
 as I said 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.859
 it runs 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:04.859
 you can gamble 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:06.779
 Oppelt 

00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:09.809
 how the really meaningful development is going to get 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.969
 now to gamble with it 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:15.089
 questionable 

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:17.749
 I think there is celebrated a 

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:21.319
 if young couple have questions that are quiet but please do not ask about them yet 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.779
 more games I will definitely not install a game on it 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:27.849
 for that I just happen in the fixed computer respectively 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:30.449
 the game concept 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:34.919
 Peter Ramsauer the video AR Rahman so come from April at the Channel 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:35.889
 so far can be used
