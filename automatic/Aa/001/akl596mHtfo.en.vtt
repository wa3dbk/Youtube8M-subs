00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.240
 welcome to another 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:09.360
 myths diary page and indeed it will 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.440
 today at the unit 731 from the green 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.660
 edition go 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.460
 together we will treat this and 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.630
 I think I'll find out if that too 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.609
 it was whole or not 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.529
 Of course I hope that most 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.710
 already know what the myth is 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.029
 or the unit 731 but for 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.039
 all those who will not know it yet 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.560
 I now again very quickly in price 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.660
 procedures explain the unit 731 was 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.759
 one of many secret facilities 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.469
 the imperial japanese army the 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.300
 biological and chemical weapons 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.399
 researched and tested 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.829
 in addition, experiments were made on living 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.329
 people or animals 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.649
 Of course, you will be down in the 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.500
 description a few left 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.910
 clean up where you are all there 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.469
 can still look a little better 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.570
 because that was really just that 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.250
 all shortest of the shortest i hope 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.410
 anyway, that's all relatively good now 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.969
 Know what the unit was 731 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.770
 now the one is probably asking 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.140
 or others also what has the whole thing 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.340
 to do pokémon 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.350
 Of course, this is something 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.299
 more complicated than most of the videos 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.460
 i had found on one 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.130
 emulator and of course that's why 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.439
 Let's just consider whether the whole 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.299
 it was or not but I have 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.280
 of course a beautiful video again 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.270
 picked out for you with me that 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.280
 maybe a little better 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.720
 can illustrate and so we too 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.970
 come as soon as possible 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.369
 can try the whole itself and 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.930
 the whole then confirm 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.930
 or not confirm 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.880
 so here it is the video in which one 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.020
 now, first of all, not much looks 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.880
 the route 7 in which he is in the top 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:46.290
 piece or the penultimate one 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.380
 piece of the grass is looking around and as 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.390
 For the first time it finds a motive 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.350
 really stop the whole thing 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.460
 Japanese is and that's just it 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.830
 Practical because I have those too 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.730
 Japanese version of the beta version 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.410
 do not know it yet 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.440
 and he is actually always in this 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:08.880
 corner up there and try that 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.590
 to find pokémon 731 and how we are now 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.570
 then see you soon 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.400
 He also finds it the weird one 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.230
 Music sets in and we see first 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.940
 and we are told that this is 731 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:25.520
 and all the different pictures with 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.520
 Honors and others when displayed 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.350
 Now that we are all about the myth 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.870
 know or most of it and I you 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.150
 I'll also tell you how to do it 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.950
 So the different kinds of how to 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:43.050
 we can think of the pokémon 731 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:47.700
 I'll start and talk to ourselves 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:51.150
 Myth handcart and try unity 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.810
 731 so to speak to be found on the 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.480
 route 7 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.239
 I have several hours as I said 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.790
 brought to the game boy 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:02.550
 also off screen now to the said 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.060
 always to come and the whole thing too 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.709
 as realistic as possible 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.840
 you can imagine in Japanese 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.370
 it's not that easy, but with it 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.010
 I'm not so far off here now 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.440
 By the way, it's good 47 and I'll be there 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:19.069
 now just go there like it is in 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.930
 the video was too and right now 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.269
 I would like to say just how 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.990
 you should do it all again 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.000
 So there are several possibilities 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.360
 there is the possibility that once 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.280
 one at a certain point in the grass 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.130
 should go there and then meet there 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.530
 unit 731 it is actually like that 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.870
 Of course, there are quite a lot known 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.850
 different styles everyone has somehow 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.500
 so his own probably appears 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.470
 invented and I think the whole 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.720
 of course a little weird on everyone 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.200
 Case, for example, is now available 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.400
 still the doctor that one 731 pokémon on 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.880
 this route must be defeated 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.320
 or in this grass 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.190
 So here on the route 7 where I have it 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.720
 degree'm in and I find the whole 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:07.830
 varying possibilities a bit 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:10.410
 especially I can do that 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.440
 not imagine that everyone be themselves 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.900
 rhyming my own stuff together and yes me 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.780
 think each of us will be fine 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.470
 think how the whole thing will go out 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:25.250
 of course I have planned to do it 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:28.460
 to spend some time at least 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.560
 a few hours in any case 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.270
 I will try as much as possible 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:37.520
 defeat pokemon on this route and 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.080
 then I will if it is still 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.060
 somehow, of course , it works directly 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.780
 still recording 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.940
 and I would say go now in 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:51.290
 a bit more grass and me 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.910
 come synonymous directly to the conclusion so 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.310
 I have almost everything now 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.930
 tried and if you still others 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.310
 have options then write me 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.840
 please in the comments then I will 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:06.470
 try another suite 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:09.020
 diary about the 1731 to make or 1 2 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.880
 keep from 2 video has been from the 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.000
 mythen diary several stops 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:16.220
 still the third stay and now 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.070
 Finally, if I continue 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:21.020
 try to find the unit 731 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.059
 I again briefly about the said 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:27.689
 manufacturer of this 

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:29.759
 myth or in the game the 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:33.710
 said unit to the 3 1 a bit 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:37.710
 it was a certain one 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:40.830
 nakamura and the whole was at that time 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:43.219
 Game freak busy and was also for 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:46.289
 the pokémon series responsible 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:48.899
 among other things was also for the music in 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:51.839
 Verbania was there to play with 

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:54.689
 and should be a direction to the unit 

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:57.059
 731 have had 

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:58.649
 and his father is supposed to be there 

00:05:57.059 --> 00:06:00.990
 have been busy but one 

00:05:58.649 --> 00:06:03.419
 10 31 I guess we have that way now 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.879
 good as everything tries and I will 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:10.199
 Of course, keep trying that too 

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:11.300
 find out whole and be said yes 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:14.699
 I still do everything 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:17.339
 and now I can actually and to 100 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:19.919
 percent say that this myth is one 

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:22.949
 Legend will remain and there were the 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:25.990
 unit 731 never in pokémon the whole 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:27.310
 was as I said only a myth and 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.530
 I would say we have it 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.510
 whole confirmed i would of course 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:34.240
 again happy about feedback and likes 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:35.830
 if you liked it then let me 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.850
 but also feedback since I would be me 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:39.160
 always happy about it 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:41.710
 and yes, I already have as I said 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.030
 I did not have a good day anymore 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.130
 Of course, I hope that the long 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:47.020
 Waiting time not too much damaged 

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:49.810
 but still writes me a bit 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:52.030
 comments rows and yes of course say 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:56.310
 what the third mythen diary 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:56.310
 until the next with a diary
