00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
look as good as all those early clips we

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.370 
look as good as all those early clips we
saw<00:01:19.920> like<00:01:20.549> remember<00:01:20.970> when<00:01:21.150> Kyrie<00:01:22.020> did<00:01:22.200> that

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
saw like remember when Kyrie did that

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.670 
saw like remember when Kyrie did that
step-back<00:01:22.860> jumper<00:01:22.920> over<00:01:23.340> DeAndre<00:01:24.090> Jordan

step-back jumper over DeAndre Jordan

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.020 
step-back jumper over DeAndre Jordan
that<00:01:25.680> trailer<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.189> came<00:01:26.490> out<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.670> few<00:01:26.729> months

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
that trailer that came out a few months

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.030 
that trailer that came out a few months
ago<00:01:27.210> those<00:01:27.540> graphics<00:01:28.020> was<00:01:28.170> way<00:01:28.439> better

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
ago those graphics was way better

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.219 
ago those graphics was way better
but<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.119> wasn't<00:01:30.390> gameplay<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.079> was<00:01:31.200> a

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
but that wasn't gameplay that was a

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.020 
but that wasn't gameplay that was a
pre-rendered<00:01:32.040> clip<00:01:32.310> maybe<00:01:32.520> that's<00:01:32.759> why<00:01:32.939> it

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
pre-rendered clip maybe that's why it

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.800 
pre-rendered clip maybe that's why it
looks<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.299> good

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
looks so good

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.530 
looks so good
the<00:01:34.110> graphics<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.650> we<00:01:34.860> see<00:01:35.040> in<00:01:35.130> this<00:01:35.220> trailer

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
the graphics that we see in this trailer

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.330 
the graphics that we see in this trailer
they're<00:01:36.540> just<00:01:36.780> not<00:01:36.960> up<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.409> par<00:01:37.590> especially

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
they're just not up to par especially

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.560 
they're just not up to par especially
after<00:01:38.520> seeing<00:01:38.909> NBA<00:01:39.270> 2k14<00:01:39.689> s<00:01:40.439> next<00:01:40.680> gen<00:01:40.950> trailer

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
after seeing NBA 2k14 s next gen trailer

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.620 
after seeing NBA 2k14 s next gen trailer
it<00:01:42.570> doesn't<00:01:43.110> even<00:01:43.200> come<00:01:43.560> close

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
it doesn't even come close

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.330 
it doesn't even come close
now<00:01:45.630> graphics<00:01:46.140> aren't<00:01:46.380> everything<00:01:46.829> they're

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
now graphics aren't everything they're

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.520 
now graphics aren't everything they're
important<00:01:47.850> they're<00:01:47.909> not<00:01:48.030> everything<00:01:48.630> but<00:01:49.380> the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
important they're not everything but the

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.620 
important they're not everything but the
gameplay<00:01:49.829> didn't<00:01:50.700> really<00:01:50.939> look<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.360> good

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
gameplay didn't really look that good

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.130 
gameplay didn't really look that good
either

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
either

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.770 
either
the<00:01:52.680> gameplay<00:01:53.130> looked<00:01:53.460> exactly<00:01:53.880> like<00:01:54.180> it's

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
the gameplay looked exactly like it's

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.859 
the gameplay looked exactly like it's
always<00:01:55.229> looked<00:01:55.500> at<00:01:55.619> in<00:01:55.740> being<00:01:55.950> live<00:01:56.329> all<00:01:57.329> the

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
always looked at in being live all the

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.580 
always looked at in being live all the
animations<00:01:58.860> were<00:01:59.189> stiff<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.729> awkward<00:02:00.719> they

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
animations were stiff and awkward they

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.560 
animations were stiff and awkward they
don't<00:02:01.770> really<00:02:01.979> look<00:02:02.219> smooth<00:02:02.640> things<00:02:03.090> don't<00:02:03.360> go

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
don't really look smooth things don't go

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.649 
don't really look smooth things don't go
together<00:02:04.009> it<00:02:05.009> looks<00:02:05.070> like<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.579> same<00:02:05.909> NBA<00:02:06.390> live

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
together it looks like the same NBA live

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.779 
together it looks like the same NBA live
game<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.740> what<00:02:07.950> were<00:02:08.069> they<00:02:08.220> doing<00:02:08.550> in<00:02:08.670> those

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
game so what were they doing in those

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:09.969 
game so what were they doing in those
last<00:02:09.090> few<00:02:09.330> years<00:02:09.599> were<00:02:09.750> they

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
last few years were they

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.440 
last few years were they
really<00:02:10.250> working<00:02:10.550> trying<00:02:11.000> to<00:02:11.060> put<00:02:11.269> out<00:02:11.360> this

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
really working trying to put out this

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.300 
really working trying to put out this
game<00:02:11.659> or<00:02:11.840> were<00:02:11.930> they<00:02:12.080> just<00:02:12.110> starting<00:02:12.650> from

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
game or were they just starting from

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.670 
game or were they just starting from
where<00:02:13.519> they<00:02:13.640> left<00:02:13.879> off<00:02:14.470> because<00:02:15.470> that's

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
where they left off because that's

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.470 
where they left off because that's
always<00:02:15.890> been<00:02:16.159> a<00:02:16.190> problem<00:02:16.400> then<00:02:16.819> be<00:02:16.940> alive<00:02:17.209> it

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
always been a problem then be alive it

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.509 
always been a problem then be alive it
just<00:02:17.629> it's<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:18.140> way<00:02:18.319> the<00:02:18.500> players<00:02:18.769> walk<00:02:19.190> and

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
just it's the way the players walk and

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.970 
just it's the way the players walk and
run<00:02:19.790> and<00:02:20.090> move<00:02:20.360> it<00:02:21.110> just<00:02:21.349> doesn't<00:02:21.739> look<00:02:21.920> right

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
run and move it just doesn't look right

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.070 
run and move it just doesn't look right
so<00:02:22.190> if<00:02:22.700> they<00:02:23.120> want<00:02:23.360> to<00:02:23.390> get<00:02:23.540> back<00:02:23.720> into<00:02:23.900> the

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
so if they want to get back into the

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.360 
so if they want to get back into the

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
immediately they've got to get smooth

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.490 
immediately they've got to get smooth
movements<00:02:28.720> graphics<00:02:29.720> on<00:02:29.840> everything<00:02:30.260> but<00:02:30.410> if

the<00:03:35.090> few<00:03:35.389> sequences<00:03:35.810> of<00:03:36.290> dribbling<00:03:36.739> that<00:03:36.950> we

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
the few sequences of dribbling that we

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.710 
the few sequences of dribbling that we
get<00:03:37.310> to<00:03:37.459> see<00:03:37.900> look<00:03:38.900> good<00:03:39.639> the<00:03:40.639> moves<00:03:41.000> even<00:03:41.450> the

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
get to see look good the moves even the

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.920 
get to see look good the moves even the
way<00:03:41.840> that<00:03:42.019> the<00:03:42.169> moves<00:03:42.410> are<00:03:42.650> linking<00:03:43.099> together

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
way that the moves are linking together

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.620 
way that the moves are linking together
that<00:03:44.930> looks<00:03:45.290> smooth<00:03:45.700> it's<00:03:46.700> funny<00:03:47.060> that<00:03:47.180> the

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
that looks smooth it's funny that the

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.360 
that looks smooth it's funny that the
dribbling<00:03:48.019> looks<00:03:48.260> good<00:03:48.530> but<00:03:48.769> everything<00:03:49.190> else

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
dribbling looks good but everything else

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.659 
dribbling looks good but everything else
looks<00:03:49.459> awkward<00:03:50.120> and<00:03:50.720> weird<00:03:50.959> so<00:03:51.889> if<00:03:52.160> they<00:03:52.459> can

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:52.669 
looks awkward and weird so if they can

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:54.220 
looks awkward and weird so if they can
get<00:03:52.790> the<00:03:52.940> dribbling<00:03:53.299> to<00:03:53.419> look<00:03:53.569> good<00:03:53.720> why<00:03:53.930> can't

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
get the dribbling to look good why can't

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.809 
get the dribbling to look good why can't
they<00:03:54.349> get<00:03:54.470> everything<00:03:54.709> else<00:03:55.040> to<00:03:55.220> look<00:03:55.400> the

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 
they get everything else to look the

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.330 
they get everything else to look the
same<00:03:56.060> way<00:03:56.239> that<00:03:56.389> the<00:03:56.510> dribbler<00:03:56.870> looks<00:03:57.109> I<00:03:57.379> don't

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
same way that the dribbler looks I don't

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.059 
same way that the dribbler looks I don't
know<00:03:58.989> but<00:03:59.989> at<00:04:00.079> least<00:04:00.109> they<00:04:00.410> have<00:04:00.560> something

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
know but at least they have something

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.240 
know but at least they have something
going<00:04:01.250> for<00:04:01.430> them<00:04:01.639> and<00:04:01.910> the<00:04:02.750> 2k14<00:04:03.410> trailer<00:04:04.040> they

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
going for them and the 2k14 trailer they

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.599 
going for them and the 2k14 trailer they
didn't<00:04:04.459> show<00:04:04.639> us<00:04:04.760> any<00:04:04.940> dribbling<00:04:05.389> at<00:04:05.510> all<00:04:05.660> so

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
didn't show us any dribbling at all so

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:09.039 
didn't show us any dribbling at all so
we<00:04:07.609> can't<00:04:07.910> see<00:04:08.120> what<00:04:08.269> the<00:04:08.389> dribble<00:04:08.690> moves<00:04:08.870> are

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
we can't see what the dribble moves are

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:11.849 
we can't see what the dribble moves are
looking<00:04:09.290> like<00:04:09.470> for<00:04:09.739> 2k<00:04:10.160> 14<00:04:10.639> we<00:04:10.879> see<00:04:10.910> lives

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
November 19 so that means that you get a

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.340 
November 19 so that means that you get a
ps4<00:04:40.610> 2k14<00:04:41.780> people<00:04:42.780> are<00:04:42.870> going<00:04:42.960> to<00:04:43.050> be<00:04:43.110> playing

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
ps4 2k14 people are going to be playing

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.200 
ps4 2k14 people are going to be playing
2k14<00:04:43.950> before<00:04:44.460> they<00:04:44.580> can<00:04:44.730> even<00:04:44.850> get<00:04:45.030> their

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
2k14 before they can even get their

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.730 
2k14 before they can even get their
hands<00:04:45.480> on<00:04:45.660> the<00:04:45.750> V<00:04:45.900> in<00:04:45.990> live<00:04:46.170> and<00:04:46.410> I<00:04:46.470> think

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
hands on the V in live and I think

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.830 
hands on the V in live and I think
that's<00:04:46.920> a<00:04:47.040> mistake<00:04:47.190> for<00:04:48.120> live<00:04:48.330> since<00:04:48.690> they've

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
that's a mistake for live since they've

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.380 
that's a mistake for live since they've
been<00:04:48.870> out<00:04:49.170> of<00:04:49.200> the<00:04:49.380> game<00:04:49.560> so<00:04:49.590> long<00:04:50.010> I<00:04:50.390> don't

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
been out of the game so long I don't

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:52.970 
been out of the game so long I don't
think<00:04:51.570> it's<00:04:51.690> a<00:04:51.780> good<00:04:51.930> idea<00:04:52.290> for<00:04:52.500> them<00:04:52.650> to<00:04:52.680> come

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
think it's a good idea for them to come

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.030 
think it's a good idea for them to come
out<00:04:53.100> days<00:04:53.430> later<00:04:54.500> since<00:04:55.500> they've<00:04:55.740> been<00:04:55.770> out<00:04:56.010> of

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
out days later since they've been out of

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.770 
out days later since they've been out of
the<00:04:56.250> game<00:04:56.430> for<00:04:56.669> so<00:04:56.820> long<00:04:57.060> and<00:04:57.300> that's<00:04:57.360> my<00:04:57.570> first

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
the game for so long and that's my first

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.460 
the game for so long and that's my first
floater<00:04:58.310> the<00:04:59.310> floaters<00:04:59.700> are<00:04:59.730> coming<00:05:00.090> back<00:05:00.470> but

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
floater the floaters are coming back but

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.110 
floater the floaters are coming back but
since<00:05:01.770> life<00:05:02.040> has<00:05:02.070> been<00:05:02.400> out<00:05:02.550> of<00:05:02.580> the<00:05:02.760> game<00:05:02.910> for

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
since life has been out of the game for

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.960 
since life has been out of the game for
so<00:05:03.300> long<00:05:03.510> you<00:05:04.500> want<00:05:04.770> people<00:05:05.130> to<00:05:05.280> give<00:05:05.790> your

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
so long you want people to give your

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.640 
so long you want people to give your
game<00:05:06.180> a<00:05:06.210> try<00:05:07.280> but<00:05:08.280> if<00:05:08.490> they<00:05:09.210> get<00:05:09.419> 2k14<00:05:10.080> first

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
really no reason to try live because

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.540 
really no reason to try live because
it's<00:05:16.260> already<00:05:16.710> looking<00:05:16.860> like<00:05:17.160> it's<00:05:17.310> not<00:05:17.400> going

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
it's already looking like it's not going

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.640 
it's already looking like it's not going
to<00:05:17.640> be<00:05:17.730> as<00:05:17.880> good<00:05:18.120> so<00:05:18.720> oh<00:05:18.960> look<00:05:19.320> at<00:05:19.410> that<00:05:19.440> ankle
