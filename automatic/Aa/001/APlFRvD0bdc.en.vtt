hand you will say well I want to down
this<00:00:42.290> one<00:00:42.590> because<00:00:43.520> I<00:00:43.670> get<00:00:43.880> ten<00:00:44.090> points<00:00:44.440> but

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
this one because I get ten points but

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.340 
this one because I get ten points but
then<00:00:45.590> you<00:00:45.710> say<00:00:45.920> well<00:00:46.190> I<00:00:46.460> make<00:00:47.450> I<00:00:47.630> better<00:00:47.960> not<00:00:48.140> do

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
then you say well I make I better not do

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.740 
then you say well I make I better not do
that<00:00:48.380> because<00:00:48.710> if<00:00:49.100> he<00:00:49.220> is<00:00:49.250> playing<00:00:49.610> five<00:00:49.940> then

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
that because if he is playing five then

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.960 
that because if he is playing five then
he<00:00:50.840> would<00:00:50.960> get<00:00:51.080> ten<00:00:51.290> points<00:00:51.470> also<00:00:51.790> then<00:00:52.790> that's

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
he would get ten points also then that's

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.410 
he would get ten points also then that's
okay<00:00:53.330> because<00:00:54.020> if<00:00:54.350> he<00:00:54.440> placed<00:00:54.740> a<00:00:54.890> blank<00:00:55.130> five

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
okay because if he placed a blank five

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.540 
okay because if he placed a blank five
then<00:00:56.420> you<00:00:56.630> can<00:00:56.780> also<00:00:57.020> get<00:00:57.770> ten<00:00:58.010> points<00:00:58.280> with

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
then you can also get ten points with

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.140 
then you can also get ten points with
the<00:00:58.610> double<00:00:58.880> blank<00:00:59.410> so<00:01:00.760> well<00:01:01.760> that's<00:01:01.970> say<00:01:02.090> you

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:02.150 
the double blank so well that's say you

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.970 
the double blank so well that's say you
didn't<00:01:02.420> want<00:01:02.600> to<00:01:02.630> do<00:01:02.720> that<00:01:02.750> and<00:01:03.710> you<00:01:03.800> say<00:01:03.950> well

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
didn't want to do that and you say well

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.380 
didn't want to do that and you say well
I<00:01:04.129> don't<00:01:04.250> want<00:01:04.460> to<00:01:04.550> give<00:01:04.640> them<00:01:04.760> any<00:01:04.910> points

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
I don't want to give them any points

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.900 
I don't want to give them any points

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
well remember the score will always

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.200 
well remember the score will always
dictate<00:01:08.570> on<00:01:08.960> what<00:01:09.860> the<00:01:10.100> down<00:01:10.310> should<00:01:10.730> be<00:01:10.940> or

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
dictate on what the down should be or

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.310 
dictate on what the down should be or
what<00:01:11.570> you<00:01:11.750> should<00:01:11.780> risk<00:01:12.230> went<00:01:13.010> down<00:01:13.190> your<00:01:13.460> hand

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
what you should risk went down your hand

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.840 
what you should risk went down your hand
if<00:01:15.320> he<00:01:15.650> only<00:01:15.920> needs<00:01:16.130> ten<00:01:16.370> points<00:01:16.610> to<00:01:16.670> win<00:01:16.820> the

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
if he only needs ten points to win the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.450 
if he only needs ten points to win the
game<00:01:17.150> then<00:01:17.990> you're<00:01:18.410> most<00:01:18.620> likely<00:01:18.890> gonna<00:01:19.190> want

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
game then you're most likely gonna want

played<00:01:24.220> okay<00:01:25.220> that's<00:01:25.940> that<00:01:26.180> hand<00:01:26.450> let's<00:01:26.690> look

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
played okay that's that hand let's look

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.680 
played okay that's that hand let's look
at<00:01:26.960> one<00:01:27.140> other<00:01:27.170> hand<00:01:27.590> here<00:01:27.830> and<00:01:28.790> here's

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
at one other hand here and here's

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.290 
at one other hand here and here's
another<00:01:29.810> hand<00:01:30.260> what<00:01:31.250> I<00:01:31.280> always<00:01:31.460> advocate<00:01:31.850> from

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
another hand what I always advocate from

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.390 
another hand what I always advocate from
dominoes<00:01:32.960> is<00:01:33.290> that<00:01:33.440> you<00:01:33.560> play<00:01:33.740> from<00:01:33.950> strength

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
dominoes is that you play from strength

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.310 
dominoes is that you play from strength
which<00:01:35.210> means<00:01:35.450> you<00:01:35.630> play<00:01:35.810> your<00:01:36.050> strongest

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
which means you play your strongest

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.450 
which means you play your strongest
suits<00:01:36.740> first<00:01:37.250> and<00:01:37.580> often<00:01:39.130> except<00:01:40.130> in<00:01:40.340> this

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
suits first and often except in this

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.850 
suits first and often except in this
case<00:01:40.520> when<00:01:41.510> it's<00:01:41.659> now<00:01:41.810> your<00:01:42.050> turn<00:01:42.080> to<00:01:42.350> down

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
case when it's now your turn to down

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.070 
case when it's now your turn to down
first<00:01:43.280> you<00:01:43.640> have<00:01:44.090> to<00:01:44.180> be<00:01:44.240> very<00:01:44.450> careful

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
first you have to be very careful

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.500 
first you have to be very careful
because<00:01:45.110> you<00:01:45.740> do<00:01:45.920> not<00:01:46.100> necessarily<00:01:46.700> want<00:01:47.210> to

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
because you do not necessarily want to

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.750 
because you do not necessarily want to
pass<00:01:47.720> your<00:01:47.990> opponent<00:01:48.530> on<00:01:48.680> your<00:01:49.220> first<00:01:49.490> down

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
pass your opponent on your first down

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.910 
pass your opponent on your first down
and<00:01:50.270> when<00:01:50.810> you<00:01:50.900> look<00:01:51.050> at<00:01:51.200> if<00:01:51.380> you<00:01:51.500> play<00:01:51.680> from

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
and when you look at if you play from

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.770 
and when you look at if you play from
strength<00:01:52.280> here<00:01:52.550> then<00:01:53.060> this<00:01:53.270> is<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:53.540> real

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
strength here then this is the real

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.570 
strength here then this is the real
common-sense<00:01:54.350> play<00:01:54.860> to<00:01:55.130> play<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.460> double

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
common-sense play to play the double

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.880 
common-sense play to play the double
four<00:01:55.940> maybe<00:01:56.210> because<00:01:57.020> you<00:01:57.200> have<00:01:57.380> four<00:01:57.740> the

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
is a very bad that was ethic it could be

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.300 
is a very bad that was ethic it could be
a<00:02:19.570> good<00:02:19.870> down<00:02:20.080> but<00:02:20.770> it's<00:02:20.890> not<00:02:21.040> worth<00:02:21.280> the

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
a good down but it's not worth the

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.580 
a good down but it's not worth the
gamble<00:02:21.700> and<00:02:22.030> what<00:02:22.510> I<00:02:22.540> recommend<00:02:22.840> that<00:02:23.170> you<00:02:23.260> do

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
gamble and what I recommend that you do

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.990 
gamble and what I recommend that you do
it<00:02:24.130> started<00:02:24.580> with<00:02:24.700> a<00:02:24.730> score<00:02:25.330> and<00:02:25.770> that<00:02:26.770> way

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
it started with a score and that way

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.180 
it started with a score and that way
after<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.480> first<00:02:28.780> play<00:02:29.050> then<00:02:29.650> you<00:02:29.830> can<00:02:29.980> start

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
after the first play then you can start

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.850 
after the first play then you can start
playing<00:02:30.400> from<00:02:30.700> strength<00:02:31.120> even<00:02:31.870> if<00:02:32.170> he<00:02:32.320> has<00:02:32.560> the

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
playing from strength even if he has the

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.150 
playing from strength even if he has the
a<00:02:33.370> six<00:02:34.270> and<00:02:34.600> cause<00:02:34.990> ten<00:02:35.350> points<00:02:35.710> right<00:02:35.860> here

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
a six and cause ten points right here

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.520 
a six and cause ten points right here
what<00:02:36.850> you<00:02:36.880> still<00:02:37.240> can<00:02:37.390> play<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.900> sixth<00:02:38.290> raid

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
what you still can play the sixth raid

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.020 
what you still can play the sixth raid
which<00:02:39.160> I<00:02:39.280> would<00:02:39.430> recommend<00:02:39.520> you<00:02:39.880> to<00:02:39.910> do

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
which I would recommend you to do

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.430 
which I would recommend you to do
although<00:02:40.300> you<00:02:40.510> don't<00:02:40.750> have<00:02:40.840> any<00:02:40.990> other<00:02:41.080> trace

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
although you don't have any other trace

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.260 
although you don't have any other trace
I<00:02:41.710> still<00:02:42.010> recommend<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:42.550> play<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.760> sixth<00:02:43.120> ray

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
I still recommend you play the sixth ray

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.960 
I still recommend you play the sixth ray
at<00:02:43.420> that<00:02:43.570> point<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:44.140> then<00:02:44.950> whenever<00:02:45.370> you<00:02:45.880> get

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
at that point and then whenever you get

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.910 
at that point and then whenever you get
an<00:02:46.090> opportunity<00:02:46.210> to<00:02:46.630> play<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:46.780> force<00:02:47.170> play

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
an opportunity to play the force play

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.570 
an opportunity to play the force play
them<00:02:48.190> that's<00:02:48.730> often<00:02:49.240> as<00:02:49.390> you<00:02:49.540> can
