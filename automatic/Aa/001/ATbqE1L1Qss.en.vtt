tools yeah this is awesome it's like
we're<00:01:07.110> so<00:01:07.229> close<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.500> making<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.740> little<00:01:07.830> wall-e

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
we're so close to making a little wall-e

how<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.479> object<00:01:15.960> can<00:01:16.080> work<00:01:16.259> as<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.409> tool<00:01:16.710> which

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
how that object can work as a tool which

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.200 
how that object can work as a tool which
is<00:01:17.070> definitely<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.430> move<00:01:17.729> ahead<00:01:18.060> of

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
is definitely a move ahead of

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.120 
give it a sense of touch so Mack the
robot<00:01:46.140> can<00:01:46.320> figure<00:01:46.530> out<00:01:46.619> what<00:01:46.799> he's<00:01:46.920> holding

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
robot can figure out what he's holding

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.800 
robot can figure out what he's holding
and<00:01:47.430> how<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.549> use<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:47.880> one<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.689> more

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
and how to use it one of the more

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.539 
and how to use it one of the more
exciting<00:01:49.110> elements<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.040> Navy<00:01:50.280> is

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
exciting elements is that the Navy is

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.219 
exciting elements is that the Navy is
backing<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.060> University<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.869> even<00:01:51.960> though

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
backing the University and even though

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.990 
backing the University and even though
the<00:01:52.380> Mac<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.829> love<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.310> we're<00:01:53.460> calling<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.790> man

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
the Mac I love that we're calling a man

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.130 
the Mac I love that we're calling a man
you<00:01:54.630> should<00:01:54.840> be<00:01:54.990> called<00:01:55.200> me<00:01:56.000> robot<00:01:57.000> yeah<00:01:57.360> for

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
you should be called me robot yeah for

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.359 
you should be called me robot yeah for
sure<00:01:58.350> even<00:01:58.590> though<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.979> robot<00:01:59.219> could

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
sure even though the robot could

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.830 
sure even though the robot could
potentially<00:01:59.820> be<00:01:59.909> used<00:01:59.939> for<00:02:00.270> lots<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.600> stuff

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
potentially be used for lots of stuff

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.359 
potentially be used for lots of stuff
the<00:02:00.990> main<00:02:01.200> want<00:02:01.530> right<00:02:01.710> now<00:02:01.829> is<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.070> create<00:02:02.219> a

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
the main want right now is to create a

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.370 
the main want right now is to create a
robotic<00:02:02.759> partner<00:02:03.329> that<00:02:03.509> can<00:02:03.600> assist<00:02:03.840> military

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
robotic partner that can assist military

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.080 
robotic partner that can assist military
members<00:02:04.710> in<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.890> field<00:02:05.100> hence<00:02:05.490> why<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.790> Navy

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
members in the field hence why the Navy

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.370 
members in the field hence why the Navy
is<00:02:06.270> getting<00:02:06.479> involved<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.020> course<00:02:07.200> we're

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
is getting involved and of course we're

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.210 
is getting involved and of course we're
not<00:02:07.530> naive<00:02:07.829> Navy

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
not naive Navy

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.559 
not naive Navy
we<00:02:08.369> know<00:02:08.489> that<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.729> smart<00:02:09.000> robot<00:02:09.270> would<00:02:09.420> be<00:02:09.479> an

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
we know that the smart robot would be an

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.999 
we know that the smart robot would be an
amazing<00:02:09.750> companion<00:02:10.259> in<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.619> field<00:02:10.800> but<00:02:10.920> it

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
amazing companion in the field but it

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.390 
amazing companion in the field but it
would<00:02:11.129> also<00:02:11.250> be<00:02:11.370> pretty<00:02:11.640> amazing

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
would also be pretty amazing

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.039 
would also be pretty amazing
in<00:02:12.700> the<00:02:12.790> field<00:02:13.000> too<00:02:13.239> so<00:02:13.420> humans<00:02:13.750> might<00:02:13.900> not

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
in the field too so humans might not

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:15.869 
in the field too so humans might not
have<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.290> get<00:02:14.409> into<00:02:14.500> harm's<00:02:14.829> way<00:02:14.920> but<00:02:15.280> we<00:02:15.760> also

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
have to get into harm's way but we also

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:17.699 
have to get into harm's way but we also
get<00:02:16.150> that's<00:02:16.450> that's<00:02:16.870> really<00:02:17.079> far<00:02:17.260> off<00:02:17.319> I'm

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
get that's that's really far off I'm

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:18.960 
get that's that's really far off I'm
just<00:02:17.860> looking<00:02:18.069> forward<00:02:18.220> to<00:02:18.340> finally<00:02:18.700> having
