creatures there or basically the seventh
one<00:00:25.600> just<00:00:25.960> the<00:00:26.050> logic<00:00:26.380> growth<00:00:26.530> of<00:00:26.710> the<00:00:26.770> credit

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:27.040 
one just the logic growth of the credit

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.920 
one just the logic growth of the credit
screen<00:00:27.280> so<00:00:27.580> pretty<00:00:28.090> boring<00:00:28.480> nothing<00:00:28.600> much

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:28.930 
screen so pretty boring nothing much

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.170 
screen so pretty boring nothing much
really<00:00:29.050> you<00:00:29.200> do<00:00:29.350> that<00:00:29.560> each<00:00:30.520> of<00:00:30.730> the<00:00:30.790> creatures

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.180 
really you do that each of the creatures

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.029 
really you do that each of the creatures
have<00:00:31.330> special<00:00:31.720> abilities<00:00:31.810> and<00:00:32.439> basically

00:00:33.029 --> 00:00:33.039 
have special abilities and basically

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:34.830 
have special abilities and basically
this<00:00:33.219> one<00:00:33.430> here<00:00:33.579> just<00:00:33.820> like<00:00:33.910> charges<00:00:34.480> off<00:00:34.629> it's

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
this one here just like charges off it's

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.630 
this one here just like charges off it's
a<00:00:34.870> little<00:00:35.050> bit<00:00:35.170> faster<00:00:35.350> there's<00:00:36.130> ones<00:00:36.370> that

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
a little bit faster there's ones that

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.000 
a little bit faster there's ones that
can<00:00:36.790> paralyze<00:00:37.000> the<00:00:37.540> for<00:00:37.810> the<00:00:38.170> zam<00:00:38.440> which<00:00:38.860> is<00:00:38.980> a

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
can paralyze the for the zam which is a

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.770 
can paralyze the for the zam which is a
bit<00:00:39.160> odd<00:00:39.310> because<00:00:39.520> you<00:00:39.790> paralyze<00:00:40.210> them<00:00:40.510> when

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
bit odd because you paralyze them when

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.780 
bit odd because you paralyze them when
your<00:00:41.050> weight<00:00:41.230> when<00:00:41.860> you<00:00:42.010> versing<00:00:42.400> it<00:00:42.520> it<00:00:42.730> just

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
your weight when you versing it it just

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.729 
your weight when you versing it it just
poisons<00:00:43.480> you<00:00:43.570> it<00:00:43.690> stops<00:00:43.960> you<00:00:44.050> for<00:00:44.200> me<00:00:44.320> and<00:00:44.560> you

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
poisons you it stops you for me and you

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:46.800 
poisons you it stops you for me and you
can't<00:00:45.370> but<00:00:45.700> you<00:00:45.760> can<00:00:45.910> still<00:00:46.180> move<00:00:46.360> around<00:00:46.420> and

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:46.810 
can't but you can still move around and

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.569 
can't but you can still move around and
everything<00:00:46.989> but<00:00:47.260> when<00:00:48.220> you're<00:00:48.399> actually

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
everything but when you're actually

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:50.819 
everything but when you're actually
playing<00:00:49.149> as<00:00:49.390> it<00:00:49.600> it<00:00:49.780> totally<00:00:50.140> freezes<00:00:50.739> the

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
playing as it it totally freezes the

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.069 
playing as it it totally freezes the
enemy<00:00:51.100> there<00:00:51.280> so<00:00:51.700> bit<00:00:52.510> of<00:00:52.570> an<00:00:52.630> odd<00:00:52.750> one<00:00:52.899> that

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
enemy there so bit of an odd one that

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:54.840 
enemy there so bit of an odd one that
basically<00:00:54.010> the<00:00:54.309> whole<00:00:54.460> point<00:00:54.640> of<00:00:54.730> the<00:00:54.820> game

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
basically the whole point of the game

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.420 
basically the whole point of the game
law<00:00:55.180> is<00:00:55.360> obviously<00:00:56.050> to<00:00:56.290> relax<00:00:56.620> but<00:00:56.980> you<00:00:57.340> have

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
law is obviously to relax but you have

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.370 
law is obviously to relax but you have
to<00:00:57.579> go<00:00:57.700> around<00:00:57.820> eatin<00:00:58.480> these<00:00:58.600> little<00:00:58.870> tiny

em<00:01:29.650> I<00:01:29.860> believe<00:01:30.100> it<00:01:30.220> is<00:01:30.310> it<00:01:30.460> might<00:01:30.640> be<00:01:30.760> a<00:01:30.790> great

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
em I believe it is it might be a great

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.490 
em I believe it is it might be a great
game<00:01:31.210> by<00:01:31.390> the<00:01:31.420> way<00:01:31.540> it<00:01:31.689> looks<00:01:31.869> a<00:01:31.930> bit<00:01:32.049> like<00:01:32.110> an<00:01:32.350> M

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
game by the way it looks a bit like an M

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.250 
game by the way it looks a bit like an M
and<00:01:32.680> the<00:01:33.520> bulk<00:01:34.240> you<00:01:34.390> up<00:01:34.450> a<00:01:34.600> bit<00:01:34.630> faster<00:01:35.080> that<00:01:35.200> I

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
and the bulk you up a bit faster that I

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.840 
and the bulk you up a bit faster that I
could<00:01:35.439> hold<00:01:35.650> you<00:01:35.770> in<00:01:35.950> to<00:01:36.040> the<00:01:36.100> next<00:01:36.340> level<00:01:36.640> and

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
could hold you in to the next level and

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.250 
could hold you in to the next level and
then<00:01:37.090> there's<00:01:37.240> the<00:01:37.330> final<00:01:37.720> one<00:01:37.840> which<00:01:37.960> is<00:01:38.020> the

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260 
then there's the final one which is the

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.530 
then there's the final one which is the
sphere<00:01:38.530> type<00:01:38.920> thing<00:01:39.220> and<00:01:39.400> you<00:01:39.850> eat<00:01:40.030> that<00:01:40.060> and

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
sphere type thing and you eat that and

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.270 
sphere type thing and you eat that and
then<00:01:40.780> you<00:01:40.930> complete<00:01:41.439> your<00:01:41.470> evolution<00:01:42.159> you've

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
then you complete your evolution you've

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.039 
then you complete your evolution you've
fully<00:01:42.490> drawn<00:01:42.880> and<00:01:43.180> it<00:01:43.299> gives<00:01:43.659> you<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:43.869> next

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
fully drawn and it gives you the next

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:45.840 
fully drawn and it gives you the next
creature<00:01:44.320> so<00:01:45.040> that's<00:01:45.220> literally<00:01:45.549> the<00:01:45.670> whole

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
creature so that's literally the whole

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.120 
creature so that's literally the whole
point<00:01:46.030> of<00:01:46.150> the<00:01:46.240> game<00:01:46.270> then<00:01:47.020> well<00:01:47.380> obviously<00:01:48.009> I

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
point of the game then well obviously I
