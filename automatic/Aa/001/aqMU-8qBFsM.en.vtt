hybrid<00:00:44.059> it's<00:00:44.269> really<00:00:44.749> not<00:00:45.319> much<00:00:45.620> of<00:00:45.859> a<00:00:45.949> hybrid

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:46.339 
hybrid it's really not much of a hybrid

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:48.579 
hybrid it's really not much of a hybrid
it<00:00:46.519> does<00:00:46.579> give<00:00:46.879> you<00:00:46.999> some<00:00:47.030> punch<00:00:47.359> your<00:00:47.690> low-end

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:48.589 
it does give you some punch your low-end

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:50.229 
it does give you some punch your low-end
torque<00:00:48.710> that<00:00:49.159> general<00:00:49.640> all-around<00:00:49.789> good

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
torque that general all-around good

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:51.549 
torque that general all-around good
feeling<00:00:50.569> you<00:00:50.659> get<00:00:50.809> from<00:00:50.870> driving<00:00:51.379> a<00:00:51.409> hybrid

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
feeling you get from driving a hybrid

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:53.739 
feeling you get from driving a hybrid
but<00:00:52.249> it's<00:00:52.370> essentially<00:00:52.789> like<00:00:52.969> Subaru<00:00:53.390> took

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:53.749 
but it's essentially like Subaru took

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:55.840 
but it's essentially like Subaru took
the<00:00:53.960> electric<00:00:54.530> motor<00:00:54.739> out<00:00:55.069> of<00:00:55.100> the<00:00:55.339> blender<00:00:55.729> in

the electric motor out of the blender in

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.879 
the electric motor out of the blender in
your<00:00:55.969> kitchen<00:00:56.179> and<00:00:56.629> the<00:00:57.260> battery<00:00:57.649> out<00:00:57.679> of<00:00:57.769> your

00:00:57.879 --> 00:00:57.889 
your kitchen and the battery out of your

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
an f-350 got it I might add and probably
