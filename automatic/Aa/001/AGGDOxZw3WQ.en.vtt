which is that the heavy wire gauge and
we're<00:01:32.310> gonna<00:01:32.400> rig<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.700> much<00:01:33.299> like<00:01:33.479> we<00:01:33.600> do<00:01:33.750> like

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
we're gonna rig it much like we do like

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.120 
we're gonna rig it much like we do like
in<00:01:34.080> the<00:01:34.140> regular<00:01:34.380> warmouth<00:01:34.710> we're<00:01:34.920> going<00:01:35.040> to

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
in the regular warmouth we're going to

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.920 
in the regular warmouth we're going to
rig<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.400> on<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.580> sides<00:01:35.820> as<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.570> can<00:01:36.689> see<00:01:36.840> it

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
rig it on the sides as you can see it

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.539 
rig it on the sides as you can see it
also<00:01:37.080> has<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.530> channels<00:01:37.950> here<00:01:38.159> on<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.310> side

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
also has the channels here on the side

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.510 
also has the channels here on the side
of<00:01:38.580> the<00:01:38.729> bait<00:01:38.939> where<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:40.170> hook<00:01:40.350> will<00:01:40.530> lay<00:01:40.710> once

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
of the bait where the hook will lay once

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.670 
of the bait where the hook will lay once
we<00:01:41.670> get<00:01:41.790> everything

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
we get everything

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.440 
we get everything
lined<00:01:42.920> up<00:01:43.100> so<00:01:43.700> basically<00:01:43.850> we're<00:01:44.210> just<00:01:44.240> going

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
lined up so basically we're just going

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.360 
lined up so basically we're just going
to<00:01:44.480> run<00:01:44.660> it<00:01:44.780> through<00:01:44.930> that<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.320> top<00:01:45.530> and<00:01:46.280> like

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
to run it through that the top and like

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.370 
to run it through that the top and like
we<00:01:46.490> do<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:46.700> regular<00:01:46.970> warm<00:01:47.180> mouths<00:01:47.360> come<00:01:48.200> off

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
we do the regular warm mouths come off

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.480 
we do the regular warm mouths come off
