00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.130 
night before a lot of them are pretty
much<00:01:13.080> like<00:01:13.290> gone<00:01:13.650> they're<00:01:14.220> not<00:01:14.460> as<00:01:14.760> visible<00:01:15.540> I

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
much like gone they're not as visible I

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.210 
much like gone they're not as visible I
guess<00:01:16.590> as<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.790> was<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.299> other<00:01:18.479> day<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.979> know

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
guess as it was the other day and I know

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.990 
guess as it was the other day and I know
like<00:01:20.759> um<00:01:21.090> some<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.689> them<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:22.080> I've<00:01:22.700> used<00:01:23.700> on

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
like um some of them that I've used on

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.450 
like um some of them that I've used on
for<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.540> up<00:01:24.710> some<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.950> pimples<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.430> I

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
for the up some of the pimples that I

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.710 
for the up some of the pimples that I
used<00:01:26.909> with<00:01:27.360> this<00:01:27.659> um<00:01:28.110> have<00:01:29.450> disappeared<00:01:30.450> I

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
used with this um have disappeared I

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.560 
used with this um have disappeared I
know<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.170> doesn't<00:01:31.500> really<00:01:31.650> work<00:01:32.070> as<00:01:32.329> quick<00:01:33.329> I

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
know it doesn't really work as quick I

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.690 
know it doesn't really work as quick I
think<00:01:33.600> it's<00:01:34.140> better<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.590> use<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.100> overnight

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
think it's better to use it overnight

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.510 
think it's better to use it overnight
that's<00:01:36.210> from<00:01:36.420> my<00:01:36.630> experience<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.979> some<00:01:38.400> of

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
that's from my experience that some of

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.749 
that's from my experience that some of
them<00:01:38.640> actually<00:01:39.000> do<00:01:39.509> like<00:01:39.900> disappear<00:01:40.650> but<00:01:40.829> the

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
them actually do like disappear but the

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.160 
them actually do like disappear but the
next<00:01:41.970> day<00:01:42.030> some<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.329> them<00:01:42.540> are<00:01:42.689> actually<00:01:42.840> just

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
next day some of them are actually just

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.190 
next day some of them are actually just
less<00:01:43.470> visible<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:44.850> what<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.270> recommend<00:01:45.750> this

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
less visible so what I recommend this

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.789 
less visible so what I recommend this
product<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.770> think<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.579> does<00:01:47.880> work<00:01:48.659> fine<00:01:49.350> I

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
product I think that it does work fine I

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.740 
product I think that it does work fine I
mean<00:01:49.829> it's<00:01:50.220> not<00:01:50.399> like<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.759> best<00:01:50.970> product<00:01:51.600> out

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
mean it's not like the best product out

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.170 
mean it's not like the best product out
there<00:01:52.079> for<00:01:52.350> zits<00:01:52.829> but<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.490> mean<00:01:53.640> like<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:53.909> works

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
there for zits but I mean like it works

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.810 
there for zits but I mean like it works
for<00:01:54.450> me<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.689> it's<00:01:55.229> made<00:01:55.590> my<00:01:55.799> pimples<00:01:56.219> less

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
for me and it's made my pimples less

as<00:02:38.610> it<00:02:38.670> was<00:02:39.329> yesterday<00:02:39.540> so<00:02:40.440> yeah<00:02:40.620> I<00:02:40.650> think<00:02:40.799> it

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
as it was yesterday so yeah I think it

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.979 
as it was yesterday so yeah I think it
works<00:02:41.250> very<00:02:41.579> fine<00:02:41.940> I<00:02:42.239> mean<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.540> price<00:02:42.750> is

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
works very fine I mean the price is

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.059 
works very fine I mean the price is
pretty<00:02:43.230> cheap<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:43.890> I<00:02:44.670> think<00:02:44.910> that<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.650> lot<00:02:46.650> a

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
pretty cheap and I think that a lot a

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.670 
pretty cheap and I think that a lot a
lot<00:02:47.640> like<00:02:47.940> goes<00:02:48.569> a<00:02:48.599> long<00:02:48.840> way<00:02:49.049> like<00:02:49.290> I've<00:02:49.410> only

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
lot like goes a long way like I've only

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.940 
lot like goes a long way like I've only
used<00:02:49.829> about<00:02:50.370> like<00:02:51.000> this<00:02:51.390> much<00:02:51.930> like<00:02:52.590> I<00:02:52.739> haven't
