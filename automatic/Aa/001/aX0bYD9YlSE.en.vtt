hello this Eric from jarhead paracord
I've<00:00:03.720> had<00:00:04.170> some<00:00:04.470> requests<00:00:05.160> from<00:00:05.580> viewers

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:06.710 
I've had some requests from viewers

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.820 
I've had some requests from viewers
asking<00:00:07.710> me<00:00:07.919> how<00:00:08.160> I<00:00:08.519> do<00:00:08.900> the<00:00:09.900> individual<00:00:10.530> knots

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
asking me how I do the individual knots

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.999 
asking me how I do the individual knots
I<00:00:11.190> initially<00:00:12.019> hadn't<00:00:13.019> included<00:00:13.530> those<00:00:13.710> I

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
I initially hadn't included those I

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.000 
I initially hadn't included those I
figured<00:00:14.309> there<00:00:14.460> were<00:00:14.580> enough<00:00:14.910> videos<00:00:15.420> on

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
figured there were enough videos on

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.640 
figured there were enough videos on
YouTube<00:00:17.270> showing<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.660> round<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.410> square

crowned<00:00:20.660> Senate<00:00:22.279> but<00:00:24.199> you've<00:00:25.199> asked<00:00:25.560> for<00:00:25.619> it

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
crowned Senate but you've asked for it

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.189 
crowned Senate but you've asked for it
so<00:00:25.949> I'm<00:00:26.519> going<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.789> try<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.000> give<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.599> give<00:00:28.080> you

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
so I'm going to try to give you give you

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.279 
so I'm going to try to give you give you
a<00:00:28.230> show<00:00:28.970> you<00:00:29.970> notice<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:30.599> there's<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.900> total

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
a show you notice that there's a total

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.959 
a show you notice that there's a total
of<00:00:31.410> eight<00:00:31.619> strands<00:00:32.070> here<00:00:32.489> two<00:00:33.380> four<00:00:34.610> six<00:00:35.610> and

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
of eight strands here two four six and

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.280 
of eight strands here two four six and
eight<00:00:36.770> this<00:00:37.770> was<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.450> transition<00:00:39.450> from<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.899> four

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
eight this was a transition from a four

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.830 
eight this was a transition from a four
to<00:00:40.320> an<00:00:41.129> each<00:00:41.820> strand<00:00:43.100> which<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.840> transitioning

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
to an each strand which is transitioning

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.260 
to an each strand which is transitioning
from<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.170> shaft<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.070> get<00:00:47.370> back<00:00:47.579> whip<00:00:47.850> to

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
from the shaft of the get back whip to

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.900 
from the shaft of the get back whip to
the<00:00:48.300> handle<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.770> handles<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.489> do<00:00:50.550> are

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
the handle the handles that I do are

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.840 
the handle the handles that I do are
roughly<00:00:51.390> about<00:00:51.719> 8<00:00:52.199> inches<00:00:52.440> 8<00:00:53.160> inches<00:00:53.219> in

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
roughly about 8 inches 8 inches in

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.439 
roughly about 8 inches 8 inches in
length<00:00:54.500> but<00:00:55.500> basically<00:00:56.129> you'll<00:00:56.879> notice<00:00:57.239> that

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
length but basically you'll notice that

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.580 
length but basically you'll notice that
the<00:00:57.660> round<00:00:57.960> crown<00:00:58.379> senate<00:00:58.890> barber<00:00:59.760> poles

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
the round crown senate barber poles

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.539 
the round crown senate barber poles
around<00:01:02.629> and<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.899> basically<00:01:04.080> alters<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.280> at

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
around and it basically alters it at

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.950 
around and it basically alters it at
about<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.820> 45<00:01:06.479> 45<00:01:07.320> degree<00:01:08.100> angle<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:09.299> easiest

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
about a 45 45 degree angle the easiest

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.100 
about a 45 45 degree angle the easiest
way<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.320> found<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.920> do<00:01:11.130> this<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.930> when<00:01:12.930> your

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
way I found to do this is when your

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.469 
way I found to do this is when your
strands<00:01:14.100> are<00:01:14.250> going<00:01:14.610> up<00:01:14.790> on<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.270> right

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
strands are going up on the right

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.179 
strands are going up on the right
regardless<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.439> which<00:01:16.650> way<00:01:16.830> you're<00:01:17.040> holding

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
regardless of which way you're holding

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.560 
regardless of which way you're holding
if<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.820> right<00:01:18.030> side<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.509> going<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:19.080> going<00:01:20.070> up

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
if the right side is going is going up

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.320 
if the right side is going is going up
they'll<00:01:21.570> take<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.229> right<00:01:23.159> side<00:01:23.460> bring<00:01:24.180> it

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
they'll take the right side bring it

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.020 
they'll take the right side bring it
across<00:01:24.600> in<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.409> left<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:26.040> you'll<00:01:26.790> bring

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
across in to the left and you'll bring

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.700 
across in to the left and you'll bring
the<00:01:27.810> right<00:01:28.250> from<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.430> bottom<00:01:29.909> over<00:01:30.750> making

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
the right from the bottom over making

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.789 
the right from the bottom over making
two<00:01:32.159> loops<00:01:32.720> then<00:01:33.720> you'll<00:01:34.020> take<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.320> right

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
two loops then you'll take the right

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.630 
two loops then you'll take the right
side<00:01:36.259> bring<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.320> over<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.040> first<00:01:38.340> loop

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
side bring it over the first loop

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.020 
side bring it over the first loop
through<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.780> second<00:01:41.479> and<00:01:42.860> then<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.729> left

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
through the second and then the left

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.310 
through the second and then the left
side<00:01:45.329> over<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:46.939> over<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:47.970> first

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
side over the over the first

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:57.760 
side over the over the first
and<00:01:51.320> three<00:01:51.680> the<00:01:51.920> second<00:01:56.290> this<00:01:57.290> would<00:01:57.470> be<00:01:57.620> the

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
and three the second this would be the

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.320 
and three the second this would be the
same<00:01:58.040> process<00:01:58.640> if<00:01:59.150> it<00:01:59.270> was<00:01:59.480> a<00:01:59.630> four<00:02:00.050> strand<00:02:00.740> not

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
same process if it was a four strand not

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.480 
same process if it was a four strand not
obviously<00:02:02.330> you<00:02:02.480> would<00:02:02.660> just<00:02:02.870> have<00:02:03.400> you<00:02:04.400> know

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
obviously you would just have you know

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.210 
obviously you would just have you know
four<00:02:04.850> instead<00:02:05.300> of<00:02:05.620> instead<00:02:06.620> of<00:02:06.680> eight<00:02:06.980> and

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
four instead of instead of eight and

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.980 
four instead of instead of eight and
you'll<00:02:07.790> see<00:02:08.030> before<00:02:08.570> before<00:02:09.560> I<00:02:09.590> pull<00:02:09.920> it<00:02:10.100> tight

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
you'll see before before I pull it tight

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.530 
you'll see before before I pull it tight
that<00:02:11.990> they're<00:02:12.260> coming<00:02:12.500> across<00:02:12.860> at<00:02:13.310> a

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
that they're coming across at a

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.840 
that they're coming across at a
45-degree<00:02:14.540> angle<00:02:14.570> as<00:02:15.470> compared<00:02:16.250> to<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.610> last

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
45-degree angle as compared to the last

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.680 
45-degree angle as compared to the last
stack<00:02:17.810> which<00:02:18.590> is<00:02:18.620> what<00:02:19.010> causes<00:02:19.340> it<00:02:19.790> to<00:02:19.820> you<00:02:20.180> to

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
stack which is what causes it to you to

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:33.410 
stack which is what causes it to you to
rotate<00:02:21.280> around<00:02:24.670> pull<00:02:25.670> that<00:02:26.030> tight

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:49.210 

and<00:02:34.420> repeat<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:35.050> process

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:03:02.760 

and<00:02:50.220> then<00:02:50.460> you<00:02:50.970> see<00:02:51.210> that<00:02:51.450> 45

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:17.509 

one<00:03:03.430> more<00:03:03.730> time

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.690 

the<00:03:18.000> biggest<00:03:18.209> thing<00:03:18.569> that<00:03:18.719> you<00:03:18.930> want<00:03:19.170> to<00:03:19.290> do<00:03:19.700> is

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
the biggest thing that you want to do is

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.580 
the biggest thing that you want to do is
you<00:03:21.000> want<00:03:21.209> to<00:03:21.299> make<00:03:21.480> sure<00:03:21.870> that<00:03:22.109> everything's

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
you want to make sure that everything's

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.910 
you want to make sure that everything's
pulled<00:03:22.980> through<00:03:23.250> evenly<00:03:24.530> and<00:03:25.530> that<00:03:25.709> it's

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
pulled through evenly and that it's

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.429 
pulled through evenly and that it's
tight<00:03:28.700> and<00:03:29.700> again<00:03:29.849> you'll<00:03:30.599> notice<00:03:30.870> that<00:03:31.260> it's

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:31.439 
tight and again you'll notice that it's

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:34.280 
tight and again you'll notice that it's
transitioned<00:03:32.159> from<00:03:32.219> four<00:03:32.730> to<00:03:32.760> eight<00:03:33.290> widens

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
rather than stacking on top it's coming

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.220 
rather than stacking on top it's coming
across<00:03:40.709> at<00:03:41.129> an<00:03:41.280> angle<00:03:41.670> now<00:03:42.269> if<00:03:42.450> you<00:03:42.599> wanted<00:03:43.019> it

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
across at an angle now if you wanted it

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.690 
across at an angle now if you wanted it
as<00:03:43.590> a<00:03:44.069> square<00:03:45.079> instead<00:03:46.079> of<00:03:46.170> a<00:03:46.319> round<00:03:46.530> then<00:03:47.400> what

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
as a square instead of a round then what

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.360 
as a square instead of a round then what
you<00:03:47.849> would<00:03:48.060> do<00:03:48.329> is<00:03:49.139> just<00:03:49.230> simply<00:03:49.709> bring<00:03:50.040> it<00:03:50.250> to

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
you would do is just simply bring it to

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.440 
you would do is just simply bring it to
opposite<00:03:50.939> ends

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
opposite ends

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.490 
opposite ends
so<00:03:51.930> starting<00:03:52.549> and<00:03:53.549> bring<00:03:53.819> the<00:03:54.060> left<00:03:55.049> over<00:03:55.470> to

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
so starting and bring the left over to

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.659 
so starting and bring the left over to
the<00:03:55.590> right<00:03:55.889> up<00:03:56.629> the<00:03:57.629> top<00:03:57.930> down<00:03:58.290> right<00:03:59.280> to<00:03:59.549> the

00:03:59.659 --> 00:03:59.669 
the right up the top down right to the

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:08.390 
the right up the top down right to the
left<00:04:01.310> and<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:03.000> bottom<00:04:03.480> up<00:04:03.750> and<00:04:06.799> then<00:04:07.799> here

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
left and the bottom up and then here

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.750 
left and the bottom up and then here
you'll<00:04:08.939> notice<00:04:09.180> that<00:04:09.510> rather<00:04:09.689> than<00:04:09.989> a<00:04:10.049> 45<00:04:10.760> it's

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
you'll notice that rather than a 45 it's

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.039 
you'll notice that rather than a 45 it's
exactly<00:04:12.540> the<00:04:12.810> same<00:04:13.310> location<00:04:14.480> or<00:04:15.480> direction

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
exactly the same location or direction

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.069 
exactly the same location or direction
that<00:04:16.199> they<00:04:16.349> were<00:04:16.410> facing<00:04:16.949> before<00:04:17.750> and<00:04:18.750> you'll

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
that they were facing before and you'll

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.670 
that they were facing before and you'll
also<00:04:19.259> notice<00:04:19.709> that<00:04:19.919> now<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.370> up<00:04:21.019> up<00:04:22.019> strands

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
also notice that now the up up strands

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.820 
also notice that now the up up strands
are<00:04:22.800> on<00:04:22.919> the<00:04:23.099> left<00:04:23.340> side<00:04:23.610> as<00:04:24.050> you<00:04:25.050> continue

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
are on the left side as you continue

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:35.080 
are on the left side as you continue
this<00:04:26.669> process

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:43.329 

again<00:04:36.800> hasn't<00:04:37.800> rotated

00:04:43.329 --> 00:04:43.339 

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:45.369 

the<00:04:43.819> second<00:04:44.239> time<00:04:44.419> it<00:04:44.569> goes<00:04:44.719> through<00:04:45.079> they<00:04:45.229> go

00:04:45.369 --> 00:04:45.379 
the second time it goes through they go

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:52.419 
the second time it goes through they go
back<00:04:45.619> to<00:04:45.859> the<00:04:45.979> right<00:04:50.709> third<00:04:51.709> time<00:04:52.069> it<00:04:52.249> goes

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:52.429 
back to the right third time it goes

00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:56.409 
back to the right third time it goes
through<00:04:54.039> the<00:04:55.039> upside<00:04:55.519> will<00:04:55.759> be<00:04:55.849> back<00:04:56.089> to<00:04:56.389> the

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
through the upside will be back to the

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:04.200 
through the upside will be back to the
left

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.250 

and<00:05:04.750> now<00:05:04.990> you'll<00:05:05.770> notice<00:05:06.540> I'm<00:05:07.540> gonna<00:05:07.780> get<00:05:08.050> one

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
and now you'll notice I'm gonna get one

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:25.530 
and now you'll notice I'm gonna get one
more<00:05:10.290> more<00:05:11.290> in<00:05:11.470> there

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:25.540 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.960 

you<00:05:26.540> know<00:05:26.660> you'll<00:05:26.900> notice<00:05:27.440> that<00:05:28.340> the<00:05:28.550> colors

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
you know you'll notice that the colors

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.450 
you know you'll notice that the colors
are<00:05:29.150> no<00:05:29.330> longer<00:05:29.630> rotating<00:05:30.470> but<00:05:30.950> going<00:05:31.190> up

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
are no longer rotating but going up

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.000 
are no longer rotating but going up
straight<00:05:32.180> and<00:05:32.420> rather<00:05:33.170> than<00:05:33.440> a<00:05:33.530> rounded

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
straight and rather than a rounded

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:40.300 
straight and rather than a rounded
appearance<00:05:34.180> it's<00:05:35.180> squared<00:05:35.780> off<00:05:39.190> so<00:05:40.190> that's

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
appearance it's squared off so that's

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.470 
appearance it's squared off so that's
how<00:05:40.580> you<00:05:40.640> do<00:05:41.090> the<00:05:41.780> round<00:05:42.290> first<00:05:42.910> square<00:05:43.910> second

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:44.480 
how you do the round first square second

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.070 
how you do the round first square second
the<00:05:45.410> square<00:05:45.770> is<00:05:46.070> the<00:05:46.760> process<00:05:47.270> that<00:05:47.480> I<00:05:47.570> use<00:05:47.840> to

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
the square is the process that I use to

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.080 
the square is the process that I use to
tie<00:05:48.320> the<00:05:49.310> panic<00:05:49.910> snap<00:05:50.240> in<00:05:51.460> simply<00:05:52.460> by<00:05:52.640> feeding

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
tie the panic snap in simply by feeding

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.500 
tie the panic snap in simply by feeding
it<00:05:53.360> through<00:05:53.560> and<00:05:54.560> coming<00:05:55.040> over<00:05:55.300> I'll<00:05:56.300> do<00:05:56.480> a

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:56.510 
it through and coming over I'll do a
