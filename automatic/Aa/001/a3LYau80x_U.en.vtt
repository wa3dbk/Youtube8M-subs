00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:11.900
 Whether the mobile is also easier than ever I want to make a weekly lobby this time 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.450
 It is lobby 545 to make this time 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:18.619
 I want to make 4 so let's go 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.619
 Introduction 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:29.750
 Then we will introduce the parts used in the Roby 54 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:32.960
 It is this servo motor one neck that was offered this time 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:37.829
 It seems to be turning Neck turning like one 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:43.289
 And to use this time and the servo cable strung the seal at No. 53 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:46.000
 It becomes a head stand assembled at 85. Then we will assemble immediately . 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:51.640
 Let's go 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:58.440
 Our process is to connect the servo cable to the servo 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:58.440
 First of all it now Aso is a child I in the I statement we will remove this screw 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.640
 Hmm 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.950
 ie 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.979
 There 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:19.360
 Yeah 4 doing this not thought out well and remove I keep setting cover 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:25.200
 Yes I disconnected 5 connectors this time in the place where I got this number 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.200
 Let's attach the servo cable to the Sabo cable connector 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:41.210
 Yes If you put on a serve cable , next is 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:46.590
 I will continue the cover again 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:52.799
 Through the cable to the old sky 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:55.210
 If you put a cover on it, let's tighten this screw a little loose as this cover is removed 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.979
 There is no need to match and look 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.979
 Let's stop the screw and go 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.690
 A N 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:27.830
 Yes I'm tightening now Let's go to the next process The next process is 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:32.390
 It is first in Mar Suhai or become a process of writing the servo test and star id 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:34.540
 Remove the cable here-is it supposed to survive ? 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.790
 In wearing a little while ago 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:41.030
 Cable and Nopa's House 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.390
 Now connect the cable to the connector 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.390
 Yes 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:52.600
 Yes I'm connected Now let's turn on the power first I'm confusing here, but white 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.930
 There is a power supply 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:03:02.849
 Power switch length 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:08.670
 Yes it lights up and one lamp is on here I spend the outside set only once 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:09.510
 If this happens, this motor will move, so first check that this moves 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.250
 Let's go 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.930
 I will say 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.930
 Containing the Se 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:28.090
 Cormorant that has been brought to the signature after rotating to the Yes 2415 degrees to the left 45 degrees 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:28.090
 This is a normal condition two times once you specify the power supply 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.140
 Put the cane-free Research humans 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.940
 Yes 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:44.300
 Then it is in the same state again, but it is as it is, id of servo 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:48.900
 I would like to write this serve id action 13 so this up button 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:52.830
 I will go 12 times 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:04:00.000
 123456789 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:04:00.630
 Milk j It is hard to ruin It is confirmed that it is Nakayama by this and long press this test and set 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.050
 And 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.050
 You go 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:12.390
 It blinks Yes I thought writing was over when this fall disappeared 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:16.120
 I power supply is cut Well 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:23.560
 I will go in and put it on once more . 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:28.680
 If become 13 to theft and sued now I have been in January Yes put writing is normal street 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.680
 It means that it is over, I will try to go a little 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.969
 It is taught whether it is because it became a felony even if spirits came forward 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:40.429
 Yes 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:43.560
 It is in 3 and it is moving the delivery normally Yes this is a good situation 

00:04:40.429 --> 00:04:47.500
 There is a situation that writing is complete 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.630
 It is not a place to cut people 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.520
 This pull out turn 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.900
 Yes i will go 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.729
 And 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.729
 Reattach the warning section 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.520
 Yes 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:12.030
 Hmm 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:12.030
 In addition, in this time of stroke you'll see also See you next time you will end with more than
