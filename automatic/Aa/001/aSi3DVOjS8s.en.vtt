bulleted<00:01:31.710> submachine<00:01:32.250> gun<00:01:32.400> that's<00:01:32.579> pretty

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
bulleted submachine gun that's pretty

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.270 
bulleted submachine gun that's pretty
much<00:01:32.880> why<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.150> just<00:01:33.680> that's<00:01:34.680> probably<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:35.070> think

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
much why I just that's probably I think

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.920 
much why I just that's probably I think
that's<00:01:35.460> why<00:01:35.610> it's<00:01:35.790> over<00:01:35.909> powered<00:01:36.240> up<00:01:36.390> besides

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
that's why it's over powered up besides

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.219 
that's why it's over powered up besides
the<00:01:37.020> fact<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.290> it's<00:01:37.409> um<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:38.960> think<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.200> I

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
the fact that it's um I think that I

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.719 
the fact that it's um I think that I
think<00:01:40.590> most<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.890> them<00:01:40.979> actually<00:01:41.100> have<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.369> bit

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
think most of them actually have a bit

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.880 
think most of them actually have a bit
