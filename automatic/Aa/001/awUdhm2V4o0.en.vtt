so I recommend giving around 1 mil and
coming<00:05:07.639> back<00:05:07.880> after<00:05:08.180> one<00:05:08.750> week<00:05:09.550> anyways<00:05:10.550> after

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
coming back after one week anyways after

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.850 
coming back after one week anyways after
that<00:05:11.090> you<00:05:11.240> guess<00:05:11.419> will<00:05:11.600> see<00:05:11.810> this<00:05:12.020> you<00:05:12.320> put<00:05:12.560> all

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
that you guess will see this you put all

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.990 
that you guess will see this you put all
of<00:05:13.370> this<00:05:14.320> under<00:05:15.320> the<00:05:15.440> would<00:05:15.850> actually<00:05:16.850> you

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
of this under the would actually you

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.340 
of this under the would actually you
will<00:05:17.090> have<00:05:17.270> five<00:05:17.630> left

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
will have five left

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.100 
will have five left
you<00:05:18.889> can<00:05:19.100> choose<00:05:19.430> on<00:05:19.639> putting<00:05:20.090> it<00:05:20.210> on<00:05:20.389> mining

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
you can choose on putting it on mining

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.110 
you can choose on putting it on mining
unknown<00:05:21.740> herbs<00:05:22.310> I<00:05:22.840> recommend<00:05:24.699> both<00:05:25.699> of<00:05:25.940> them

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
unknown herbs I recommend both of them

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.140 
unknown herbs I recommend both of them
it's<00:05:26.680> highly<00:05:27.680> recommended<00:05:27.830> splitting<00:05:28.789> them

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 
it's highly recommended splitting them

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.250 
it's highly recommended splitting them
on<00:05:29.389> herbs<00:05:29.780> but<00:05:30.710> since<00:05:30.950> mining<00:05:31.700> sells<00:05:32.539> faster<00:05:33.080> I

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
on herbs but since mining sells faster I

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:38.529 
on herbs but since mining sells faster I
put<00:05:33.530> it<00:05:33.650> on<00:05:33.800> mining<00:05:35.620> anyways<00:05:36.620> guys<00:05:37.539> after

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:38.539
