me ah BRB ani not really too great I

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.699 
me ah BRB ani not really too great I
think<00:02:58.769> um<00:02:59.780> figure<00:03:00.780> a<00:03:00.810> Deadeye<00:03:01.080> chemistry<00:03:01.560> star

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
think um figure a Deadeye chemistry star

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.710 
think um figure a Deadeye chemistry star
which<00:03:01.830> is<00:03:01.950> kind<00:03:02.190> of<00:03:02.280> decent<00:03:02.459> a<00:03:02.819> couple<00:03:03.659> of
