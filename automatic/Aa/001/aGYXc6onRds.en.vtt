00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.190
 guys i'm the touch with inspire themselves 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.290
 today for very crazy denmark 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.970
 everybody always dreams of doing it 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.840
 that up in street year ng any 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.240
 stop 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.119
 even on the wooden play door more 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.730
 so today we will sign the flip that 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.800
 mattrick heavily used when all 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.809
 skate mode i guess 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.809
 and that's it, let's go there 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:02.399
 the following the flip lomborg is a bit is 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.110
 practically the same in the beginner in the cup 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.990
 after an end you will put 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.690
 your pec but gives the copper afterwards 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:15.899
 frequency down your father in front 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:18.000
 it will make the turn just right has 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:20.490
 maybe a little more different longboard 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.130
 because it is a little bigger than between 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.289
 this everything else that will have to put the 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.600
 foot but the same way here and when 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:30.000
 kick the pop and the clip will go 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.420
 push your body forward to 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.399
 You used to kick the skateboard and move forward. 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.990
 you're in together you do not stay 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.149
 most people he kicks the 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:44.610
 people go forward 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:46.679
 so this is the biggest mistake in the black sea 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.270
 now it goes to the weaker part of the 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:54.960
 thing will get the foot off your regular base 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.179
 the golf put the back foot I do not have 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.860
 this one right in the middle of the shape 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:01.429
 when you press down it 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.770
 go and give a little drink, go and kick it 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:06.300
 There are many people who prefer direct and have 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.580
 people who kick like a skateboard and 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.349
 kicks out is better because 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.470
 the safe will rise higher then your 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.120
 skateboard goes up passed away down and goes 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.270
 too hard and going too fast 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.720
 group b rapidão then it is a little more 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:25.050
 complicated 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.050
 and has even more of an ally and scare 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.210
 That's it. I'll show you. Thanks. 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.210
 anatel 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.500
 weighed 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.730
 ae 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.490
