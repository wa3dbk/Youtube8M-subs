00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
working and you're still using it just

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.150 
working and you're still using it just
know<00:02:36.450> that<00:02:36.480> you're<00:02:37.200> oh<00:02:37.230> you're<00:02:37.770> on<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:37.980> radar

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
know that you're oh you're on the radar

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.150 
know that you're oh you're on the radar
it's<00:02:38.580> probably<00:02:39.330> just<00:02:39.600> a<00:02:39.690> question<00:02:39.990> of<00:02:40.080> time<00:02:40.160> so

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
it's probably just a question of time so

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.520 
it's probably just a question of time so
what<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.400> really<00:02:41.430> need<00:02:41.940> to<00:02:42.180> ask<00:02:42.690> yourself<00:02:42.960> is

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
what you really need to ask yourself is

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.520 
what you really need to ask yourself is
what<00:02:44.250> percentage<00:02:44.910> of<00:02:45.030> my<00:02:45.210> traffic<00:02:45.690> comes<00:02:46.350> from

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
what percentage of my traffic comes from

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.900 
what percentage of my traffic comes from
google<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.870> if<00:02:48.870> it's<00:02:49.050> anything<00:02:49.350> more<00:02:49.650> than

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
google and if it's anything more than

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.090 
google and if it's anything more than
probably<00:02:50.910> about<00:02:51.060> twenty<00:02:51.480> percent<00:02:52.040> then<00:02:53.040> I

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
probably about twenty percent then I

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.520 
probably about twenty percent then I
would<00:02:53.370> be<00:02:53.490> really<00:02:53.820> concerned<00:02:54.240> because<00:02:55.020> I<00:02:55.230> mean

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
would be really concerned because I mean

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.500 
would be really concerned because I mean
do<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.800> numbers<00:02:56.160> figure<00:02:56.490> the<00:02:56.610> math<00:02:56.820> and<00:02:57.120> and

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
do the numbers figure the math and and

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.240 
do the numbers figure the math and and
find<00:02:57.750> out<00:02:57.840> what<00:02:58.020> would<00:02:58.140> happen<00:02:58.500> if<00:02:58.650> your

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
find out what would happen if your

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.710 
find out what would happen if your
business<00:02:59.580> were<00:03:00.450> suddenly<00:03:01.320> shaved<00:03:02.220> of<00:03:02.720> say

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
business were suddenly shaved of say

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.590 
business were suddenly shaved of say
forty<00:03:03.780> five<00:03:04.470> fifty<00:03:04.800> percent<00:03:05.310> of<00:03:05.520> its<00:03:05.910> volume

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
forty five fifty percent of its volume

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.800 
forty five fifty percent of its volume
what<00:03:07.350> would<00:03:07.470> that<00:03:07.560> do<00:03:07.740> to<00:03:07.770> you<00:03:08.010> so<00:03:09.000> it's

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
what would that do to you so it's

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.480 
what would that do to you so it's
something<00:03:09.960> to<00:03:10.110> consider<00:03:10.230> really<00:03:11.040> really

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
something to consider really really

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.360 
something to consider really really
carefully<00:03:12.060> because<00:03:12.270> it's<00:03:12.600> a<00:03:12.720> real<00:03:12.960> problem

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
carefully because it's a real problem

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.480 
carefully because it's a real problem
now<00:03:15.410> fortunately<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.770> solution<00:03:17.220> to<00:03:17.370> this

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
now fortunately the solution to this

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.790 
now fortunately the solution to this
problem<00:03:17.670> is<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.060> get<00:03:18.960> other<00:03:19.170> traffic<00:03:19.530> sources

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
problem is to get other traffic sources

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.640 
problem is to get other traffic sources
right<00:03:20.220> don't<00:03:21.120> be<00:03:21.300> so<00:03:21.510> dependent<00:03:21.780> upon<00:03:22.020> one<00:03:22.410> and

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
right don't be so dependent upon one and

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.140 
right don't be so dependent upon one and
especially<00:03:23.100> don't<00:03:23.280> be<00:03:23.550> so<00:03:23.670> dependent<00:03:23.880> upon

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
especially don't be so dependent upon

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.970 
especially don't be so dependent upon
Google<00:03:24.600> when<00:03:24.750> they've<00:03:24.900> proven<00:03:25.440> that<00:03:25.620> they<00:03:25.800> are

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
Google when they've proven that they are

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.400 
Google when they've proven that they are
kind<00:03:26.670> of<00:03:26.700> out<00:03:26.850> to<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:27.540> shut<00:03:27.750> down<00:03:27.780> affiliates

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
kind of out to to shut down affiliates

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.360 
kind of out to to shut down affiliates
so<00:03:28.860> I<00:03:29.330> you<00:03:30.330> know<00:03:30.360> I<00:03:30.450> I<00:03:31.200> talked<00:03:31.740> a<00:03:31.830> lot<00:03:31.950> about<00:03:32.010> the

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
so I you know I I talked a lot about the

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.880 
so I you know I I talked a lot about the
fact<00:03:32.610> that<00:03:32.810> going<00:03:33.810> on<00:03:33.930> almost<00:03:34.140> two<00:03:34.440> years<00:03:34.650> ago

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
fact that going on almost two years ago

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.420 
fact that going on almost two years ago
I<00:03:35.510> abandoned<00:03:36.510> PPC<00:03:37.020> since<00:03:37.980> then<00:03:38.160> I've<00:03:38.280> come

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
I abandoned PPC since then I've come

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.130 
I abandoned PPC since then I've come
back<00:03:38.580> a<00:03:38.610> little<00:03:38.880> tiny<00:03:39.150> bit<00:03:39.270> but<00:03:39.600> really<00:03:39.990> for

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
back a little tiny bit but really for

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.960 
back a little tiny bit but really for
the<00:03:40.260> for<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.530> majority<00:03:41.040> of<00:03:41.220> it<00:03:41.370> I<00:03:41.430> just<00:03:41.580> don't

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
the for the majority of it I just don't

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.670 
the for the majority of it I just don't
touch<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.150> PPC<00:03:42.630> anymore<00:03:42.930> because<00:03:43.320> I<00:03:43.470> found

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
touch the PPC anymore because I found

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.260 
touch the PPC anymore because I found
something<00:03:43.920> that<00:03:44.160> just<00:03:44.310> for<00:03:44.550> me<00:03:44.700> was<00:03:44.940> working

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
something that just for me was working

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.850 
something that just for me was working
so<00:03:45.420> much<00:03:45.540> better<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:46.020> didn't<00:03:46.500> have<00:03:46.620> any<00:03:46.800> of

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
so much better and didn't have any of
