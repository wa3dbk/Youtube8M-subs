00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
watch-dog excels because the hacking is

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.319 
watch-dog excels because the hacking is
just<00:02:30.010> so<00:02:30.159> unique<00:02:30.489> and<00:02:30.670> it's<00:02:30.879> really<00:02:31.060> cool<00:02:31.269> and

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
just so unique and it's really cool and

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:33.209 
just so unique and it's really cool and
they<00:02:31.629> incorporated<00:02:32.469> it<00:02:32.590> into<00:02:32.709> every<00:02:33.069> aspect

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:33.219 
they incorporated it into every aspect

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:35.129 
they incorporated it into every aspect
of<00:02:33.579> the<00:02:33.730> gameplay<00:02:34.060> it's<00:02:34.569> not<00:02:34.750> kind<00:02:34.959> of<00:02:35.049> this

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:35.139 
of the gameplay it's not kind of this

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:36.449 
of the gameplay it's not kind of this
broken<00:02:35.379> experience<00:02:35.980> where<00:02:36.129> you<00:02:36.219> do<00:02:36.340> it

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
broken experience where you do it

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.539 
broken experience where you do it
sometimes<00:02:36.969> in<00:02:37.389> driving<00:02:37.870> it<00:02:38.200> works<00:02:38.500> to<00:02:38.739> disable

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
sometimes in driving it works to disable

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.819 
sometimes in driving it works to disable
cops<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:40.000> people<00:02:40.269> chasing<00:02:40.540> you<00:02:40.810> hack<00:02:41.349> bridges

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
motion and it's fun to just screw around

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.289

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
was surprised with this well a lot of

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:36.839 
was surprised with this well a lot of
times<00:03:35.829> when<00:03:36.040> you<00:03:36.159> are<00:03:36.310> just<00:03:36.519> roaming<00:03:36.669> around

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
times when you are just roaming around

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:38.550 
times when you are just roaming around
it<00:03:37.090> does<00:03:37.269> feel<00:03:37.540> like<00:03:37.720> just<00:03:37.989> another<00:03:38.079> grand

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
it does feel like just another grand

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.199 
it does feel like just another grand
theft<00:03:38.680> auto<00:03:38.859> game<00:03:39.220> or<00:03:39.519> another<00:03:39.549> saint's<00:03:40.150> row

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
theft auto game or another saint's row

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:41.969 
theft auto game or another saint's row
game<00:03:40.359> the<00:03:40.989> fact<00:03:41.229> that<00:03:41.349> it<00:03:41.439> has<00:03:41.560> a<00:03:41.590> simple

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:41.979 
game the fact that it has a simple

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:43.800 
game the fact that it has a simple
hacking<00:03:42.400> mechanism<00:03:42.909> with<00:03:43.299> the<00:03:43.449> game<00:03:43.629> that

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
hacking mechanism with the game that

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.539 
hacking mechanism with the game that
works<00:03:43.959> so<00:03:44.199> well<00:03:44.379> gives<00:03:44.979> it<00:03:45.069> a<00:03:45.129> little<00:03:45.310> bit<00:03:45.400> of<00:03:45.459> a

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
works so well gives it a little bit of a

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.099 
works so well gives it a little bit of a
uniqueness<00:03:45.849> to<00:03:46.120> the<00:03:46.209> sandbox<00:03:46.629> type<00:03:46.870> of<00:03:46.989> thing

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
uniqueness to the sandbox type of thing

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:48.390 
uniqueness to the sandbox type of thing
that<00:03:47.229> we've<00:03:47.349> seen<00:03:47.530> so<00:03:47.739> much<00:03:47.889> and<00:03:48.069> multiplayer

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
that we've seen so much and multiplayer

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.890 
that we've seen so much and multiplayer
is<00:03:48.729> cool<00:03:48.939> I<00:03:48.970> guess<00:03:49.239> I<00:03:49.389> didn't<00:03:49.569> have<00:03:49.629> a<00:03:49.689> lot<00:03:49.810> of

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
is cool I guess I didn't have a lot of

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:50.969 
is cool I guess I didn't have a lot of
times<00:03:50.049> to<00:03:50.139> play<00:03:50.259> with<00:03:50.409> the<00:03:50.470> regular<00:03:50.769> game

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:50.979 
times to play with the regular game

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:53.219 
times to play with the regular game
modes<00:03:51.280> but<00:03:51.819> uh<00:03:51.879> jumping<00:03:52.599> into<00:03:52.750> other<00:03:52.840> people's

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:53.229 
modes but uh jumping into other people's

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:54.960 
modes but uh jumping into other people's
games<00:03:53.379> and<00:03:53.650> stuff<00:03:53.769> when<00:03:54.159> it<00:03:54.280> works<00:03:54.459> it's<00:03:54.729> cool

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
games and stuff when it works it's cool

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.429 
games and stuff when it works it's cool
sometimes<00:03:55.359> it's<00:03:55.629> a<00:03:55.659> little<00:03:55.870> confusing<00:03:55.989> it's

00:03:56.429 --> 00:03:56.439 
sometimes it's a little confusing it's

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:57.869 
sometimes it's a little confusing it's
not<00:03:56.560> laid<00:03:56.739> out<00:03:56.859> very<00:03:56.889> well<00:03:57.159> but<00:03:57.669> the<00:03:57.759> whole

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:57.879 
not laid out very well but the whole

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:59.309 
not laid out very well but the whole
multiplayer<00:03:58.719> is<00:03:58.840> seamlessly<00:03:59.259> integrated

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
multiplayer is seamlessly integrated

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.530 
multiplayer is seamlessly integrated
with<00:03:59.829> single-player<00:04:00.340> so<00:04:00.790> that's<00:04:01.180> always<00:04:01.359> good

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
with single-player so that's always good

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.699 
with single-player so that's always good
right<00:04:01.840> one<00:04:02.049> little<00:04:02.229> thing<00:04:02.349> I<00:04:02.409> didn't<00:04:02.590> like

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
right one little thing I didn't like

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.050 
right one little thing I didn't like
while<00:04:02.889> the<00:04:02.949> AI<00:04:03.099> is<00:04:03.280> challenging<00:04:03.879> sometimes

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:14.859 
and it kind of just kept getting awkward

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:16.589 
and it kind of just kept getting awkward
with<00:04:15.009> people<00:04:15.250> just<00:04:15.280> like<00:04:15.489> boxing<00:04:16.030> me<00:04:16.150> in<00:04:16.269> well

it's<00:04:16.750> good<00:04:16.870> that<00:04:16.900> the<00:04:17.079> AI<00:04:17.199> is<00:04:17.349> good<00:04:17.650> it<00:04:17.799> just

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
it's good that the AI is good it just

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.289 
it's good that the AI is good it just
didn't<00:04:18.190> make<00:04:18.280> for<00:04:18.459> a<00:04:18.519> lot<00:04:18.699> of<00:04:18.789> fun<00:04:18.969> and<00:04:19.209> it

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
didn't make for a lot of fun and it

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:20.879 
didn't make for a lot of fun and it
didn't<00:04:19.509> really<00:04:19.599> look<00:04:19.900> cool<00:04:20.199> either<00:04:20.560> and<00:04:20.829> the

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
didn't really look cool either and the

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:22.110 
didn't really look cool either and the
driving<00:04:21.130> can<00:04:21.400> be<00:04:21.489> a<00:04:21.519> little<00:04:21.669> bit<00:04:21.849> slippery

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
driving can be a little bit slippery

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.580 
driving can be a little bit slippery
well<00:04:22.510> I<00:04:22.539> do<00:04:22.630> think<00:04:22.870> it<00:04:23.050> controls<00:04:23.380> well

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
well I do think it controls well

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:24.810 
well I do think it controls well
especially<00:04:23.800> with<00:04:24.010> the<00:04:24.130> motorcycles<00:04:24.669> it's

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
especially with the motorcycles it's

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:25.890 
especially with the motorcycles it's
good<00:04:24.940> for<00:04:25.090> weaving<00:04:25.330> in<00:04:25.419> and<00:04:25.479> out<00:04:25.599> of<00:04:25.659> traffic

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
good for weaving in and out of traffic

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:26.760 
good for weaving in and out of traffic
