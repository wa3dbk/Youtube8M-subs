00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:05.870
 Each year, some 2,400 cases are diagnosed in Spain. 

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:10.790
 you take the most frequent malignant brain tumor at present there is no natera 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.910
 effective for this reason the university clinic of Navarre 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.810
 has started a clinical trial 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.110
 aimed at assessing the effectiveness 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.550
 of a treatment based on immunotherapy 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.519
 it is about the administration of personalized vaccines obtained from 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.369
 cells and the patient's own tumor 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.289
 the clinic is currently the only Spanish center that conducts a study 

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:35.250
 of these characteristics 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.050
 glioblastoma is the most frequent malignant brain tumor 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.880
 In recent years significant progress has been made in both surgery 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.130
 as therapy radiotherapy com 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.840
 but in spite of these multidisciplinary treatments unfortunately the 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.470
 disease progresses in most cases 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.970
 in the essay that we started right now the clinic university of Navarre what 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.570
 What we intend is to teach the immunity of the patient using their 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.090
 own cells and the tumor that removed moss 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.379
 to react against that tumor that chase the last of the tumors 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.460
 very small preliminary trials of this kind of experience 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.620
 have shown that it can be effective precisely in those patients 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.440
 in which the boy wide extirpations of the tumor 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.490
 since we incorporated the fluorescence microscope a couple of years ago 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.440
 our situation index 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.090
 complete the tumor at this time 80% portugal which we think gives us a 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.090
 fantastic opportunity to take advantage of immunotherapy 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.530
 after the conventional treatments is radiotherapy surgery 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.030
 and chemotherapy 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.210
 in most cases there are remains of tumor tissue 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.770
 what in the course of a few months or a few years can grow back and be able to 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.680
 the fossores that the patient relapsed 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.210
 during the test 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.870
 the new treatment is administered to patients combined with the procedure 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.570
 initial standard that consists in the surgical removal of the tumor 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.409
 seriousness of the administration of radiotherapy and chemotherapy 

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:18.709
 personalized vaccines elaborate in the cell therapy gmp laboratory of the 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:19.809
 clinic 

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:23.899
 Each preparation is produced from two elements obtained from the own 

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:26.609
 patient 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:30.969
 the fundamental dendritic cells in the functioning of the immune system 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:33.659
 and the tumor cells 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:37.170
 the dendritic cells are obtained from a process called 

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:42.159
 apheresis that consists of the separation of white blood cells from the rest of the 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:47.089
 The patient's blood to the dendritic cells is then added to the 

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:51.669
 processed tumor cells so that the immune system is capable of 

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:54.669
 generate antibodies against glioblastoma cells 

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:58.809
 what we intend with this experimental treatment and is 

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:02.319
 administered in vaccines prepared with the patient's own cells 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:07.659
 that are able to direct the immune system is to say the natural system of 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:11.859
 defense of the organism against these remains of tumor tissue and in that way 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:15.449
 keep it controlled prevent it from proliferating and prevent the patient 

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:17.049
 relapse 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.530
 the selection criteria for a person to participate in the trial 

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:21.390
 clinical 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.100
 begin with the existence of a diagnosis of gastona river or the 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.140
 suspected of suffering it is also essential that the patient has not 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.000
 been previously treated contrary takes them 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.150
 as well as not having undergone a wide tumor excision 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.540
 Once these requirements have been met, the patient can already participate in a trial that 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.710
 Advances on the path to more effective treatment 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:45.830
 against this brain tumor
