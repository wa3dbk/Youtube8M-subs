 % and I am very happy to be here tonight 

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:15.259
 I love Egypt but it is not cystic fibrosis 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:19.589
 before I tell you about my story this 

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:26.339
 he did not say how many women he tries is excellent 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.419
 what is written 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.670
 an evening of april 91 in an office of the hospital necker in paris 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.400
 in a few seconds our recent happiness to be parents of a small 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.660
 girl collapsed into a chasm will bring complaint unknown to us the 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.220
 cystic fibrosis 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.710
 in those distant times that did not exist by information about this disease 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.320
 was rare and more optimistic 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.610
 I remember an article claiming that more children are getting older 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:53.620
 adult 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.380
 this little girl the relationship to the ton in 20 years the referee but also his 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.290
 parents have learned to live with this more and more cumbersome 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.080
 more and more binding 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.740
 imitate the first years and some pills 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.250
 and a single physiotherapy session a day care has become not invasive 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.360
 two sessions of physiotherapy a day 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.360
 then 3 05 e per day many antibiotic courses by infusion 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.870
 then for a few months the oxygen first anus then two days 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.439
 and then there are all these little things that everyday type that brings back to the 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.490
 disease 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.490
 give up doing sports 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.890
 find an apartment with a lift 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.320
 go out with his oxygen bottle and limit the duration of the artists 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.540
 a little over a year ago the doctors told us about greece 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.280
 have passed many previous exams we have had interviews 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.090
 with the doctors with the psychologists of the hospital 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.090
 he m the idea of ​​lnf was the school accepted 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.680
 then we found the long time 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.180
 the constraint of the operation giving way instead of the fear of not finding any 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.640
 any act of donors expectations 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.510
