00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.680
 So, look at this. Now, this is not a mode . 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.990

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:33.660
 If that's the case , it's changed by putting the setting like this . 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:36.900
 cma And I can change the tower like this. 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.950
 It's like walking on the TV. 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:44.700
