00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.750
 how about youtube friends talk to them their 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.750
 friend mario genesis and this time you 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.420
 I bring youtube blog 1.6 points 9 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.730
 for minecraft and this new 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.800
 alonso pro update does not change 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.290
 nothing simple sight but if also what 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.809
 is the design of the new menu of ours 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.980
 tool that does not change anything and in this 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.739
 neither changed for us 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.570
 we entered what is bike friendship here 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.760
 up appears to us let's say that 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.379
 manage us the option of if option 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.690
 I 'm not going to prepare this 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:50.480
 because honestly it does not look like it's 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.550
 you will realize good let's say 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.350
 that everything remains the same the only thing 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.149
 important here that you said you've 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.079
 changed and that benefits us all is 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:02.710
 when we import one a mod 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.710
 script 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.060
 if we arrive in this one we will save 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.890
 here and if you want 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.070
 let's say install another one and you have to be 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.530
 looking again at storage not 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.820
 I do not know anymore it's not going to be the same 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.950
 be saved what is this part 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.400
 and so it's going to stay saved and there's 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.250
 what to look for we go to what is 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.900
 also be an option options of 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.530
 blog night I think the most important thing 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.540
 how do you see the design has changed a lot 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.520
 and now they will ask but how do I choose 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.990
 the texture or the good skin and then 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.600
 appears and off 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.890
 and we are going to eat I want a 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.780
 texture package what I'm going to 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.780
 to say is to select above it and 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.490
 here what will it be to me to say that 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.110
 select me in this case I put it 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.259
 select and I will look what is my 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:58.450
 texture in Durban and I look for say 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:02:02.289
 it's red let's say I want to look for another 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.390
 and goal comes into play but I have the same 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:05.829
 because I want to put another what 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.810
 does this to you is to keep all the 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:10.030
 textures as you see I have saved this 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.709
 and I have saved it is ok it was 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.319
 texture change are going to change here 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.930
 without saying that saves you time 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.230
 because before we have to be entering 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.090
 to your folder and looking for your let's say your 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.910
 action now not now it's going to save in 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.980
 this extract from let's say original is what 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.269
 same as if rut's foreign but 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.269
 in this case I'm not going to do it 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.010
 we will use and 3 kim just the same 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.110
 and here in this case we are going to give you the 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.500
 we go to the folder where we have what 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.420
 is the skin 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.830
 and if it's going to be saved as you see 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.760
 here I kept the first one and the 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.130
 second and in that of pc skin you put in 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:54.390
 where it says dollars that exist then the 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:56.900
 name let's say we tell you a youtube 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.209
 famous that I played minecraft 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.200
 we put here are not names because 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:05.659
 we put the capo not that I know the lack and 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.760
 if the players kim them but like 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:09.470
 I do not like to copy because we are not going 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.930
 to do 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.600
 well the safe side is the same as 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:18.860
 we remove and learn with a new 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:22.040
 patch manager design administer 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.950
 add-ons and activate mode support 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.440
 which is the same we have here here 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.140
