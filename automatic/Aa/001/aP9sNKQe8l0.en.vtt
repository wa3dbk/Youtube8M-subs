if you guys wanting to walk all over
there<00:03:32.710> I<00:03:32.740> think<00:03:32.800> I<00:03:32.980> have<00:03:33.070> a<00:03:33.130> save<00:03:33.340> state<00:03:33.550> for

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
there I think I have a save state for

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.860 
there I think I have a save state for
that<00:03:34.380> mode<00:03:35.380> would<00:03:35.530> like<00:03:36.520> Helia<00:03:37.330> hopefully<00:03:37.810> I

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
that mode would like Helia hopefully I

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.650 
that mode would like Helia hopefully I
do<00:03:38.730> because<00:03:39.730> of<00:03:39.820> all<00:03:39.940> the<00:03:40.060> musical<00:03:40.390> thinking<00:03:40.630> I
