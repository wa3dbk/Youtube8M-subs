00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:08.220
 hello big little lovers 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:12.090
 tanks with you tour and m 4043 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.940
 oddly enough artillery on the very 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.400
 I'm a big fan of artillery 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.330
 often played on it before or 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.830
 Well, in general, after nerf too 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:27.990
 I continue to play it with pleasure 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:30.689
 although I have quite a bit of her 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.969
 my favorite object 2 61 has long been 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.420
 idle in the hangar crew on it 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.700
 completely different tanks have been transplanted 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:42.530
 but nevertheless it does not mean and I 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:46.500
 stopped loving my mouth and this video will be like 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:51.030
 a small end of season 2 season 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.610
 ours with you and in general the other 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.890
 parties this will be opening discovery 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.930
 next season which I probably 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.010
 if everything works out for me and everything will be 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.980
 ok dedicate 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.350
 mostly artillery though 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.890
 of course, and about other tanks, I forget not 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.400
 would like to press a button but here 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.159
 look 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.530
 not worth it probably not worth eating big 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.290
 Chance not to fall and knowingly did not shoot 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.650
 see later why but so here 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.750
 artillery that we have artillery in 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.479
 the last time happened as you know 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.780
 her zanerfili and much it 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.150
 it seems to be like to reduce 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:33.299
 the number of fans to shoot from afar 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.659
 suitcases but a slight pause until 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.729
 there was a devil nevertheless 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.979
 people still take the arts anyway 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.520
 shoot and get this max 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.040
 fan and pleasure in particular for example 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.770
 i 'm i 'm swinging my americans what 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.659
 there is 8 levels of art to me she is very 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.409
 I like total Americans due 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.960
 their own 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.880
 in prenatal pickup right impressed 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.840
 impresses 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.460
 here look when you shoot at 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.890
 Arte to the present necessarily 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.459
 try not to wait until complete 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.950
 information but also wait a little 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.620
 do here because I had a deal here this 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.920
 complaint but really wanted to hook the waffle 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.500
 but a big chance that you may not 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:24.360
 get actually as I said 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:30.560
 artillery and tanks in general 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:33.090
 probably some kind of good luck value 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.489
 which is given to us every time we 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.660
 we get into a fight what do I mean this 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:43.530
 what's the chance of us getting it either 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.420
 there is either no and if you see that your 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.819
 tank or your artillery starts 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.790
 starts to work out well 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:53.640
 even for the most general ones there is not very accurate 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:57.450
 information means good luck today to your 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:00.480
 efforts here if the opposite if you do not 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.430
 you get what it means unfortunately you do not 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.340
 lucky and in this battle you will not succeed 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.380
 a lot of things I shoot but it 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.290
 Lyrical digression so to speak as 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.639
 have you seen we now successfully enter about 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:16.709
 wrapped under his lower armor outfit 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:18.750
 our artillery allows you to do it for 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.209
 due to the fact that she has a large spread and 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.790
 now we will try again of course 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.109
 again there is a big chance to write for 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.840
 rock 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:29.669
 but by no means who runs the risk of not 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.010
 drinking champagne by splash and 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:33.989
 try to at least apply at least 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.739
 any damage while everyone else is there 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.440
 are hiding 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:41.310
 although the tank on our line shot but 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:44.220
 there is a big chance that we do or 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.040
 shell still stands right now with jewelry 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.639
 accuracy where necessary and it cannot 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.739
 not happy 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:54.120
 Here is the form of Pershing now stands in the same 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:56.669
 positions as 62a principle for 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.200
 artillery position is not very successful 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:01.199
 because he stands behind the small 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.100
 a mound and here it can be 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:08.710
 problem because 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:12.430
 if the projectile is flying on the bench 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.670
 trajectories and the chance to get in here in this 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.670
 here 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:19.510
 mountain as you see the trajectory we have 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:22.450
 very straight we shoot right here 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.200
 how do you think the Spanish and yes and we do not 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.710
 get into 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.570
 Pershing is sorry and we think that there is no need 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.940
 we do this translate into 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.840
 waffle waffle always have to try 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.910
 cut out because operas they are cardboard 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.970
 you do not enter a big solid 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:43.630
 again great help to the team if 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:46.600
 waffle we will cut with you in advance now I 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:49.990
 I see that on the right we are not very 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.960
 good all machine left us two 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.030
 against three and I specifically moved to this 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:05:01.050
 hollow not to repeat the fate of iv and 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:03.730
 3805 whose name was who the essence is 14 2 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.440
 I am here thought not to shoot off 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.960
 shoot back and the fact is i'm there 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:11.190
 worth m 50-55 instead of a very highway 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:15.270
 brokerage account and shoot back and there 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:17.860
 in general yes byte and trouble 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.920
 so we decided to avoid them immediately and 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:24.390
 shot at obama back everyone 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:27.400
 I take away 212 she, too, in general, not bad and 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:29.410
 I am going further here we have them 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.110
 obviously won but there is a chance 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.980
 shoot some get 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.180
 little 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:40.500
 burned last 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:42.900
 I'll tell you right here I got about 2100 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:46.370
 In my opinion, if you do not collect much damage 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:48.030
 for artillery but i did as you see 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:51.419
 for now three 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:54.720
 let's not open a big secret 4 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:56.639
 fraga and got a huge pile 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.729
 pleasure not spent nor barney fights 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:01.830
 no gold mines everything was nice 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:04.590
 everything was fast and huge 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:09.000
 pleasure so ladies and gentlemen wait 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:11.310
