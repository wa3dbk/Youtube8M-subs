00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:36.360
 and then that directed to them 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.620
 we say environment past seasons 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.060
 prepare us very well because it is waiting for us 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.220
 a tournament that 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.070
 that is always sometimes decisive for 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.350
 we 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.900
 and this physical stage we know is hard 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.910
 but but that is fundamental to be able 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.130
 have because a tournament is coming 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.860
 complicated because we're going to have 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.380
 pressure because the team can play 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.640
 directly with other rivals 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:05.990
 directly 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.790
 the percentage issue then our idea 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.720
 is to prepare ourselves well to have a 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:14.220
 good sequence of a good start of 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.560
 tournament with many matches 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.590
 winning for everything at the beginning and may have 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:26.490
 a good initial stage because they are going to 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:28.830
 to need us but not to lose 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.320
 getting lost is fundamental can be a 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.340
 solid team starting from behind for 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.340
 forward later 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:41.770
 you have to be obviously very effective at 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.210
 the time to offend 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.100
 you have to have a goal and then 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.350
 defend yourself defend yourself as it has to be 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.220
 it is believed that the equipment that 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.220
 start from back to front 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.570
 that are compact because you are in large 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.880
 things are champions come to the end is 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.710
 the liguillas then the idea is that 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.430
 the equipment closed in motion reviewed 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.860
 with the very idea of you can add and the 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.530
 team was contudente was solid and that 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.369
 is what we finish the tournament 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.369
 we have to start 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.650
 everyone's commitment is nothing but not 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.630
 falls on the people of experience who have 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.760
 come that meeting of the past and the 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.090
 who have already come those who are going to arrive 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.030
 now 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.760
 Of course the problem is everyone's 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.640
 neither can we say that it is not my 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.069
 problem because that goes for the load 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.200
 loading during previous years 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.870
 but today we are here the commitment is 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.910
 of the biggest ones like the three most 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.730
 young because 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.090
 because we are in a social stage that 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.710
 it is defined that it can be said is tournament 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.630
 the future of many of us then 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.480
 the idea is that we all put our 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.160
 granite of sand and we can participate what 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.140
 to touch us or the kind that we 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.270
 the parties that we are at a hundred 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.510
 cent and obviously try to win give 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.670
 give everything for young people today 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.440
 experience already also in selections 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.190
 minors and they have a 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.230
 responsibility at the moment that those of 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.210
 give them all but at the moment of being 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.240
 with us they have to be done 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:20.850
 charge of the function that touches them after 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:23.790
 comes the support of the great in the 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.920
 guidance and advice of course 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.690
 because it is a tournament where we are going to occupy 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.690
 of everyone and nobody has to get down more 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:39.510
 It was not was very quick to adapt fuern 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.730
 to all this really that has not 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.160
 come to greatly affect the issue that 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.980
 chivas the accent not very regular that 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.860
 we had 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.690
 and there has not been time to think 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.790
 in other things more than training 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:56.750
 and it's a bad week because the parties have 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.000
 been have been crucial each of 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.100
 they 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.550
 in the habitat in three stages we had 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.610
 the last tournament but 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.440
 but today I assimilate it very well I'm 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.569
 happy and happy people have received me 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.209
 all right 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:14.519
 general team was also as 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.949
 we have wanted but we have three tournaments 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:19.889
 of the team can be claimed and power 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:21.780
 and thus be able to have the results that the 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.310
 people are not required of course and that 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.099
 we also want to give them 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.210
 because a team in this hierarchy 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:37.530
 It has to be always serve us the 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:40.380
 flat if we go after all here playing 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:43.110
 it is fundamental to have participation 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.380
 with the team and support of course 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.770
 why 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.540
 because you see that we have win all and 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.610
 we can quickly get out of the problem 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.110
 in which we are today if it touches me by 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.500
 right on the left for the center 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:58.600
 I am available to the body 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.150
 technical and if you have to endure also 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:04.000
 We hold up if we have to start with everything 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.620
 Taste as always and most important 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.130
 here is that the team wins and that the 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.130
 institution 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:18.490
 if the prize tries to do better 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:22.980
 for oneself and for the institution and 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:25.230
 why people go and pay a ticket 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:28.380
 and it is what we have to have 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:30.270
 Well, all that respect is true, because there 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.370
 very faithful people there is another one who has 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.960
 away from what we hear from jara 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.610
 what we want these people 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.860
 come back to see your team 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:41.100
 protagonist go back to see a 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.510
 aggressive team an xv well we know all 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.580
 the replete with Mexicans who have 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.310
 eager to transcend and that 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:51.080
 surely this tournament is going to be a 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:54.410
 very good tournament where where the people and 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:56.460
 people go back to support their team that 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:59.060
 we also need that 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:02.780
 support we will receive with 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.780
 results and with delivery
