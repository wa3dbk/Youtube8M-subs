00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:15.809
 My name is Emanuel Díaz Sánchez 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.679
 I'm a biology student 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:19.029
 and then 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.470
 I will present my tutorial on lowe schools 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.779
 titled as the animal kingdom 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.109
 Invertebrate animals 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.849
 vertebrates 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.480
 life is full of many secrets and mysteries to discover 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.480
 the scientists 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.320
 with each passing day they will ask for new discoveries to the whole planet or in 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.210
 particular cases changes to existing discoveries 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.399
 let's have for example 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.650
 to animals that live on another planet earth 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.590
 perhaps 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.020
 at some point in our lives 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.630
 we have asked 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.380
 how many animals there will be on the entire planet 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.800
 how many divisions ranking equals cities 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.870
 to see that the animals 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.220
 thanks to the following activity 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.090
 another area 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.500
 we can have a clearer and more precise idea about the classifications of the 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.500
 animals and their great variety in our world 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.170
 at the beginning of this task 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.170
 the student reflect on the following questions 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.120
 which are 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.050
 how big and extensive the animal world will be 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.630
 how animals are classified 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.910
 and what will those invertebrate animals be 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.110
 hinzpeter degrees 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.710
 by creating a conceptual map 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.930
 student 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.189
 You can answer these and many questions and questions 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.130
 to perform this task 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.579
 in summary the student will create a conceptual map teaching the general scheme 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:57.150
 of the animal kingdom 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.150
 with the help of their notes how many do they do on the internet 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.350
 the client will gather all the necessary information 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.200
 for the creation of your conceptual map 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.269
 the same 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.840
 base created by the couse program was 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.299
 called expire said 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:14.769
 On your computer 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.879
 and after having done the student map it will print 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:19.809
 and then continue 

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:25.719
 to deliver their work on the date henkel masters in this case this server what 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:28.719
 I had planned 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:33.819
 students will have two resources to return to that area their homework 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:36.060
 both resources 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.929
 they are web versions 

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:39.299
 where both 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.369
 they will offer you images 

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:43.379
 and information elbows 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.379
 regarding the assigned task 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.169
 as well 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:52.179
 student will have the body address for free download of the 

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:53.569
 registration program 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.469
 so that I can perform 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:58.469
 or believe your conceptual map 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:01.079
 the student 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:02.439
 will be evaluated 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:04.819
 from the next rubric 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.289
 it shows the points 

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:10.289
 that the student must meet in the afternoon 

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:14.229
 to complete the task 

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:15.479
 teacher 

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:16.459
 for 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.109
 a discussion 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:21.379
 free with all your students I asked the question is how 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.019
 this case this server would leave questions 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.659
 what do you think of the amc and diverse animal world I see it at the same time finished this 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:30.719
 homework 

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:33.759
 what animals you liked or were interested in 

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:35.859
 I lived in a weird era 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:37.400
 which are the animals that do not 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.769
 that scare us 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:39.979
 that topic 

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:43.389
 these questions are to share your pop and snow with the other companions 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.589
 but there will also be other other questions 

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:49.190
 comfortable as they are 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.779
 what do you think of the program inspire fact 

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:52.899
 they did not whistle 

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:55.899
 of it will use the computer is going to be the map 

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:59.269
 and that the space of experience 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.950
 This question will help me to know what worked in the 

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:03.879
 homework 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:08.549
 what did not work what can be changed or improved and how can I call 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.849
 few so the attention of a thousand students 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.849
 as technological aspects 

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:18.379
 up to here there is habit to survive my week with the animal kingdom 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.109
 I hope you have exhausted them 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.240
 and any suggestions or comments 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.659
 let me know 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:28.139
 since these will help me so that my future the basket arias 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.180
 remember that we are talking about the future of the country 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.100
 those children and adolescents who will be the future professionals in a tomorrow 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.630
 thanks for your attention 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.180
 I hope you liked my tutorial 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.470
 God bless you and have a nice day
