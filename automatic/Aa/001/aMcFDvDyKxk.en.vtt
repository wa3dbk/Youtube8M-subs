00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
it fits it I recommend doing the biggest

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.229 
it fits it I recommend doing the biggest
one<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.739> have<00:00:56.120> but<00:00:57.500> um<00:00:59.000> you<00:01:00.000> don't<00:01:00.120> have

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
one that you have but um you don't have

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.599 
one that you have but um you don't have
to<00:01:00.600> but<00:01:01.350> mostly<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.250> biggest<00:01:02.489> one

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
to but mostly it is the biggest one

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.369 
to but mostly it is the biggest one
because<00:01:02.910> then<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.120> have<00:01:03.149> more<00:01:03.480> room<00:01:03.539> in<00:01:04.170> case

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.620 
because then you have more room in case
you<00:01:04.559> mess<00:01:04.710> up<00:01:04.880> but<00:01:05.880> first<00:01:06.240> thing<00:01:06.360> you're<00:01:06.540> going

get<00:02:03.810> on<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.049> hole<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.580> also<00:02:05.729> looks<00:02:06.060> better

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
get on the hole and it also looks better

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.510 
get on the hole and it also looks better
if<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.600> get<00:02:06.720> it<00:02:06.780> on<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.960> hole<00:02:07.110> too

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
if you get it on the hole too

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.170 
if you get it on the hole too
so<00:02:08.520> again<00:02:08.850> just<00:02:09.030> keep<00:02:09.209> pressing<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.690> on<00:02:09.840> and

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
so again just keep pressing it on and

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.870 
so again just keep pressing it on and
then<00:02:12.890> smooth<00:02:13.890> it<00:02:14.040> out<00:02:14.160> with<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.459> stick<00:02:14.670> again

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
then smooth it out with the stick again

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.570 
then smooth it out with the stick again
and<00:02:18.709> then<00:02:19.709> now<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:19.920> you<00:02:20.220> have<00:02:20.750> every<00:02:21.750> place

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
and then now that you have every place

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.900 
and then now that you have every place
covered<00:02:23.580> impressed<00:02:24.060> nicely<00:02:25.760> you're<00:02:26.760> gonna

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
covered impressed nicely you're gonna

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.330 
covered impressed nicely you're gonna
get<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.180> file<00:02:27.450> that<00:02:27.690> came<00:02:27.870> with<00:02:28.140> it<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:29.069> just

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
get the file that came with it and just

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.449 
get the file that came with it and just
start<00:02:29.580> filing<00:02:29.940> on<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.330> edges<00:02:30.720> of<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:31.280> so<00:02:32.280> that

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
start filing on the edges of it so that

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:33.830 
start filing on the edges of it so that
way<00:02:32.550> you<00:02:32.640> can<00:02:32.760> start<00:02:32.970> to<00:02:33.060> see<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.330> form<00:02:33.630> of<00:02:33.780> the

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
way you can start to see the form of the

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.680 
way you can start to see the form of the
truck<00:02:34.350> and<00:02:34.560> use<00:02:34.739> the<00:02:34.980> rougher<00:02:35.340> edge<00:02:38.540> and<00:02:39.540> just

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
truck and use the rougher edge and just

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:40.880 
truck and use the rougher edge and just
go<00:02:39.900> around<00:02:39.989> it<00:02:40.290> as<00:02:40.380> if<00:02:40.500> you<00:02:40.620> were<00:02:40.650> like

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
go around it as if you were like

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.940 
go around it as if you were like
gripping<00:02:41.489> a<00:02:41.550> deck<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.780> it<00:02:43.230> doesn't<00:02:43.530> matter<00:02:43.830> if

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
gripping a deck and it doesn't matter if

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.500 
gripping a deck and it doesn't matter if
you<00:02:44.100> go<00:02:44.250> through<00:02:44.519> your<00:02:44.670> scrape<00:02:44.910> over<00:02:45.060> another

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
you go through your scrape over another

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.860 
you go through your scrape over another
time<00:02:45.810> because<00:02:46.640> your<00:02:47.640> truck<00:02:48.000> has<00:02:48.150> paint<00:02:48.480> on<00:02:48.690> it

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
time because your truck has paint on it

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.479 
time because your truck has paint on it
and<00:02:49.019> you're<00:02:49.650> probably<00:02:49.769> not<00:02:49.980> gonna<00:02:50.130> go<00:02:50.310> through

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
and you're probably not gonna go through

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:58.130 
and you're probably not gonna go through
the<00:02:50.549> paint<00:02:51.049> with<00:02:52.049> a<00:02:52.079> nail<00:02:52.350> file<00:02:56.810> now<00:02:57.810> that<00:02:57.989> you

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
the paint with a nail file now that you

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.810 
the paint with a nail file now that you
have<00:02:58.260> most<00:02:58.560> of<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.829> shape<00:02:59.220> kind<00:02:59.459> of<00:02:59.579> cut<00:02:59.790> out

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
have most of the shape kind of cut out

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.020 
have most of the shape kind of cut out
and<00:03:00.630> you<00:03:01.320> obviously<00:03:01.470> can't<00:03:01.920> see<00:03:02.280> that<00:03:02.430> because

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
and you obviously can't see that because

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.509 
and you obviously can't see that because
it's<00:03:03.570> still<00:03:03.870> somewhere<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.290> catch<00:03:04.500> all<00:03:05.400> so

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
it's still somewhere to catch all so

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.069 
it's still somewhere to catch all so
just<00:03:05.640> do<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.850> same<00:03:06.090> thing<00:03:06.360> to<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.570> back<00:03:06.720> mine

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
just do the same thing to the back mine

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.229 
just do the same thing to the back mine
didn't<00:03:07.350> go<00:03:07.440> that<00:03:07.620> far<00:03:07.880> so<00:03:08.880> I<00:03:08.910> don't<00:03:09.120> need<00:03:09.180> to

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
didn't go that far so I don't need to

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.289 
didn't go that far so I don't need to
worry<00:03:09.450> about<00:03:09.510> that<00:03:10.640> but<00:03:11.640> now<00:03:11.970> you're<00:03:12.269> just

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
worry about that but now you're just

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.280 
worry about that but now you're just
gonna<00:03:12.570> file<00:03:12.959> on<00:03:13.380> the<00:03:15.079> axle

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
gonna file on the axle

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.580 
gonna file on the axle
it's<00:03:16.950> gonna<00:03:17.130> file<00:03:17.400> directly<00:03:17.880> onto<00:03:18.060> it<00:03:18.390> just<00:03:18.630> so

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
it's gonna file directly onto it just so

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.680 
it's gonna file directly onto it just so
you<00:03:19.680> get<00:03:19.799> it<00:03:19.920> off<00:03:20.040> of<00:03:20.070> there<00:03:20.329> and<00:03:21.329> once<00:03:21.570> you

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
you get it off of there and once you

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.569 
you get it off of there and once you
have<00:03:21.810> like<00:03:22.049> a<00:03:22.290> decent<00:03:22.680> crease<00:03:23.010> between

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.039 

between<00:03:26.579> the<00:03:26.880> actual<00:03:27.060> hangar<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:27.570> the<00:03:27.630> axle

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
between the actual hangar and the axle

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:29.930 
between the actual hangar and the axle
you<00:03:28.200> can<00:03:28.350> just<00:03:28.530> do<00:03:28.799> a<00:03:28.829> whole<00:03:29.310> thing<00:03:29.519> off<00:03:29.640> and

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
you can just do a whole thing off and

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.660 
you can just do a whole thing off and
you're<00:03:30.030> basically<00:03:30.390> done<00:03:31.040> now<00:03:32.040> your<00:03:32.310> truck<00:03:32.519> is

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
you're basically done now your truck is

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.849 
you're basically done now your truck is
basically<00:03:33.180> done<00:03:33.420> and<00:03:33.750> all<00:03:34.410> you<00:03:34.470> have<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.620> do<00:03:34.739> is

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
basically done and all you have to do is

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:38.450 
basically done and all you have to do is
set<00:03:35.040> it<00:03:35.070> up<00:03:35.220> and<00:03:35.940> write<00:03:36.299> it
