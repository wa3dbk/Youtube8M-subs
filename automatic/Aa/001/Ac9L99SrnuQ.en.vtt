00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.580
 hello, do you ever say 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.540
 thought about growing some home 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.460
 useful plants but for example laurel 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.099
 You know, I never thought but 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.350
 a long time ago maybe 7 years ago I'm on 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.840
 the market accidentally saw a small duck 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.750
 little pot height go to Lavrushka 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.660
 I bought it for no reason at all 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.260
 put in a pot home sprinkled 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.170
 little land 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.750
 and she started growing to me once laura layer 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.140
 a big tree has grown for three weeks 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.809
 backwards 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.700
 I cut this tree, I want to say that 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.399
 regularly use a trap from this 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.980
 the trees themselves have leaves very 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.160
 delicate fresh flavor very 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.860
 different dried naturally yes here 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.530
 and there are already new leaves that is 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.719
 me share turned into a bush and here 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.250
 really want to boast look 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.620
 maybe you, too, for yourself something 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:01.350
 useful in my this video will gather 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:04.890
 voila here she is my laurels to she stands 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.720
 me here are the rollers on top of the ground I 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.040
 I pour a little sawdust can whale 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.080
 pebbles so that the earth does not fall out 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.390
 I planted the tab because 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.060
 I was probably a button and you can 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.909
 smaller pot otodvinu I specifically from 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.409
 windows to show you at all it costs 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.659
 I am alone in very good conditions burying 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.570
 standing here and so a battery 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.320
 the result is that the leaves dry up and 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.590
 leaflets 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.200
 here on the leaves you see on the tips 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.369
 withered tips like this but that's all 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.780
 because I'm lazy 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.640
 spray if you are not lazy then no 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.710
 here these tips will not be dried out and 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.509
 Lavrushka grows large enough 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.250
 literally three weeks ago somewhere I 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.079
 maybe 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.869
 cut off meter lashes resulting in 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:55.500
 Immediately began here such leaflets 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:58.200
 new see see here about the wall 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.530
 very unpretentious straight here very very 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.869
 I donâ€™t fertilize him in any way 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.600
 with him did not do the only thing once a year 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.119
 roughly I take off the top layer of earth there 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.240
 but 57 centimeters fill new everything 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.510
 worth here in my bedroom at the battery 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.520
 under direct sunlight and 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:21.150
 therefore feels very good 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.680
 I recommend here to allow another insert 5 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.340
 cents for breeding this 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.860
 plants 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.750
 the fact is that I bought it my time 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.090
 on the market in a little little pot 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.220
 pot literally centimeters 10 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.010
 diameter is tiny and here I have 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.720
 such a big tree has grown through 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.400
 a few years after i already have 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.010
 big enough was this plant to 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.640
 a friend came to me and begged me 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.470
 split the spine with several 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.080
 sprigs and give her 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.990
 we all did everything very carefully 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.870
 did tried soaked so in 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.180
 carne lines are other 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.460
 plants almost died and it did not survive 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.280
 so here do not try so do not 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.960
 spoil your trees and I heard that 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.250
 the people are somehow still growing 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.010
 laurel seed 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.400
 but the result was not seen just heard and 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.860
 a couple of words about fertilizer I already 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.810
 I said that I'm not fertilizing anything, but 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.120
 truth is fairness necessary 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.730
 notice that my grandfather once a year 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.570
 there is a little sapropel and this 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.240
 sapropel 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:27.210
 I just water when I have left 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.130
 there in the summer somewhere after watering fruit 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:33.600
 fruits of these crops there are tomatoes 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:35.310
 cucumbers that's all else in general 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.160
 fertilizer can not be considered more 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.410
 no fertilizing here it grows by itself 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.060
 It feels great here 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.310
 therefore I highly recommend for seeing u 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.620
 yourself at home and you will always have fresh 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.830
 lavrushku it certainly smells quite 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.650
 not like what we're used to 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.940
 dried here is much more intense 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.110
 much lower smell 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.110
 all good luck
