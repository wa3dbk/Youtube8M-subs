working on my skills associated with
moving<00:00:06.029> the<00:00:06.180> camera<00:00:06.450> and<00:00:06.899> when<00:00:07.259> I<00:00:07.290> say<00:00:07.500> moving

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770

the camera by the way I'm not talking

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.790 
the camera by the way I'm not talking
about<00:00:09.120> panning<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:09.750> tilting<00:00:09.809> panning<00:00:10.679> and

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
about panning and tilting panning and

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.200 
about panning and tilting panning and
tilting<00:00:10.860> just<00:00:11.370> changed<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.700> way<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.910> cameras

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
tilting just changed the way the cameras

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.400 
tilting just changed the way the cameras
pointed<00:00:12.599> they<00:00:12.719> don't<00:00:12.870> actually<00:00:12.990> move<00:00:13.290> the

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
pointed they don't actually move the

pointed they don't actually move the
camera<00:00:13.769> I'm<00:00:13.860> talking<00:00:14.250> about<00:00:14.309> moving<00:00:15.150> the

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
camera I'm talking about moving the

like to move the camera and I'll give
you<00:00:26.130> some<00:00:26.279> tips<00:00:26.430> along<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.760> way<00:00:26.880> let's<00:00:27.480> get

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
you some tips along the way let's get

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.109 
you some tips along the way let's get
started<00:00:28.099> the<00:00:29.099> most<00:00:29.310> basic<00:00:29.640> way<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.789> move<00:00:30.000> a

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
started the most basic way to move a

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.849 
started the most basic way to move a
camera<00:00:30.510> is<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.750> handhold<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.439> generally

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
camera is to handhold it and generally

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.400 
camera is to handhold it and generally
hand<00:00:32.550> holding<00:00:32.880> is<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.120> very<00:00:33.390> shaky<00:00:33.960> way<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.170> move

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
hand holding is a very shaky way to move

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.650 
hand holding is a very shaky way to move
a<00:00:34.559> camera<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.160> shakey<00:00:35.850> can<00:00:36.030> be<00:00:36.120> both<00:00:36.300> good<00:00:36.510> and

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
a camera and shakey can be both good and

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.060 
a camera and shakey can be both good and
bad<00:00:36.719> if<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.140> do<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.350> intentionally<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.950> it

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
bad if you do it intentionally and it

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.650 
bad if you do it intentionally and it
works<00:00:38.190> for<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.430> video<00:00:38.670> then<00:00:39.059> it's<00:00:39.210> good<00:00:39.420> if

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
works for the video then it's good if

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.660 
works for the video then it's good if
you<00:00:40.200> do<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.500> accidentally<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.340> it's

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
you do it accidentally and it's

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.930 
you do it accidentally and it's
distracting<00:00:42.030> then<00:00:42.719> it's<00:00:42.870> bad<00:00:43.160> here<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.520> shot

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
distracting then it's bad here is a shot

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.549 
distracting then it's bad here is a shot
of<00:00:44.969> me<00:00:45.360> hand<00:00:45.600> holding<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.930> camera<00:00:46.140> on<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.410> set

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
of me hand holding a camera on the set

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.810 
of me hand holding a camera on the set
of<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.710> short<00:00:46.920> film<00:00:47.039> I'm<00:00:47.219> producing<00:00:47.610> called

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
of a short film I'm producing called

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.000 
of a short film I'm producing called
within<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.329> for<00:00:48.989> this<00:00:49.110> scene<00:00:49.350> we<00:00:49.530> wanted<00:00:49.890> a

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
within and for this scene we wanted a

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.790 
within and for this scene we wanted a
feeling<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.520> confusion<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:51.480> shaky<00:00:52.410> camera

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
feeling of confusion so shaky camera

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.590 
feeling of confusion so shaky camera
work<00:00:52.829> seemed<00:00:53.309> like<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.610> would<00:00:53.670> help<00:00:53.879> add<00:00:54.239> that

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
work seemed like it would help add that

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.439 
work seemed like it would help add that
confused<00:00:55.199> feeling<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.920> shot<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.449> should

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
confused feeling to the shot I should

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.819 
confused feeling to the shot I should
mention<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.750> hand-holding<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.440> my<00:00:58.559> least

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
mention that hand-holding is my least

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.139 
mention that hand-holding is my least
favorite<00:00:59.160> way<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.280> move<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.609> camera<00:00:59.969> but

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
favorite way to move a camera but

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.880 
favorite way to move a camera but
sometimes<00:01:00.480> it's<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.750> only<00:01:00.780> option<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.500> it

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
sometimes it's the only option and it

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.619 
sometimes it's the only option and it
certainly<00:01:02.250> has<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.550> least<00:01:02.879> financial<00:01:03.449> cost

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
certainly has the least financial cost

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.140 
certainly has the least financial cost
associated<00:01:03.989> with<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.409> also<00:01:05.010> it's<00:01:05.610> convenient

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
associated with it also it's convenient

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.550 
associated with it also it's convenient
because<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.479> always<00:01:06.810> have<00:01:06.960> your<00:01:07.049> hands<00:01:07.320> with

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
because you always have your hands with

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.080 
because you always have your hands with
you

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
you

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.830 
you
sometimes<00:01:09.090> what<00:01:09.240> you're<00:01:09.360> looking<00:01:09.420> for<00:01:09.750> is

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
sometimes what you're looking for is

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.690 
sometimes what you're looking for is
more<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.140> linear<00:01:10.380> style<00:01:10.860> movement<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:11.640> a

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
more of a linear style movement and in a

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.399 
more of a linear style movement and in a
case<00:01:11.850> like<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.240> dolly<00:01:12.630> move<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.110> what<00:01:13.290> you

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
case like that a dolly move is what you

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.469 
case like that a dolly move is what you
want<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:14.340> can<00:01:14.520> get<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.760> look<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.299> dolly

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
want you can get the look of a dolly

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.730 
want you can get the look of a dolly
movement<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:15.990> number<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.350> different<00:01:16.590> ways<00:01:16.710> but

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
movement a number of different ways but

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.679 
movement a number of different ways but
using<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.310> dolly<00:01:17.549> will<00:01:17.820> definitely<00:01:18.240> do<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.479> for

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
using a dolly will definitely do it for

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.480 
using a dolly will definitely do it for
you<00:01:18.840> here's<00:01:19.500> an<00:01:19.650> example<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.189> skateboard

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
you here's an example of a skateboard

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.539 
you here's an example of a skateboard
style<00:01:20.970> dolly<00:01:21.240> we<00:01:21.420> used<00:01:21.600> on<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.840> set<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.140> within

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
style dolly we used on the set of within

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:24.740 
style dolly we used on the set of within
of<00:01:23.549> course<00:01:23.820> there<00:01:23.939> are<00:01:24.000> several<00:01:24.210> downsized

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
of course there are several downsized

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.510 
of course there are several downsized
using<00:01:25.080> dollies<00:01:25.470> they're<00:01:25.650> time-consuming<00:01:25.950> to

slider I really like it I highly

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.550 
slider I really like it I highly
recommend<00:02:48.790> it<00:02:48.940> one<00:02:49.690> morning<00:02:49.930> about<00:02:50.079> it<00:02:50.349> and

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
recommend it one morning about it and

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.050 
recommend it one morning about it and
probably<00:02:50.680> other<00:02:51.099> sliders<00:02:51.430> is<00:02:51.730> that<00:02:51.880> if<00:02:51.970> you're

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
probably other sliders is that if you're

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.729 
probably other sliders is that if you're
on<00:02:52.180> a<00:02:52.209> tripod<00:02:52.510> be<00:02:52.930> careful<00:02:53.319> as<00:02:53.410> you<00:02:53.500> get<00:02:53.650> out

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
on a tripod be careful as you get out

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.050 
on a tripod be careful as you get out
towards<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.099> edges<00:02:54.280> because<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:54.910> whole

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
towards the edges because the whole

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.520 
towards the edges because the whole
thing<00:02:55.269> can<00:02:55.450> topple<00:02:55.660> over<00:02:55.989> from<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.260> weight<00:02:56.410> of

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
thing can topple over from the weight of

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.830 
thing can topple over from the weight of
the<00:02:56.590> camera<00:02:56.799> when<00:02:57.700> I<00:02:57.730> use<00:02:57.940> it<00:02:58.090> on<00:02:58.180> my<00:02:58.329> tripod

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
the camera when I use it on my tripod

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.539 
the camera when I use it on my tripod
I<00:02:59.049> definitely<00:02:59.440> don't<00:02:59.799> go<00:02:59.950> out<00:03:00.099> to<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.400> edges

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
I definitely don't go out to the edges

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.729 
I definitely don't go out to the edges
I've<00:03:00.790> had<00:03:00.910> too<00:03:01.060> many<00:03:01.239> close<00:03:01.480> calls<00:03:01.739> my

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
I've had too many close calls my

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.380 
I've had too many close calls my
personal<00:03:03.190> favorite<00:03:03.579> way<00:03:03.760> to<00:03:03.790> move<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.180> camera

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
personal favorite way to move the camera

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.509 
personal favorite way to move the camera
is<00:03:04.629> using<00:03:04.870> a<00:03:05.049> Steadicam<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:06.190> great<00:03:06.400> thing

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
is using a Steadicam the great thing

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.160 
is using a Steadicam the great thing
about<00:03:06.579> Steadicam<00:03:07.180> is<00:03:07.299> they<00:03:07.420> it<00:03:07.690> gives<00:03:08.019> you

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
about Steadicam is they it gives you

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.080 
about Steadicam is they it gives you
freedom<00:03:08.620> to<00:03:08.769> move<00:03:08.980> almost<00:03:09.340> in<00:03:09.640> any<00:03:09.819> direction

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
freedom to move almost in any direction

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.610 
freedom to move almost in any direction
that<00:03:10.390> you<00:03:10.510> can<00:03:10.720> think<00:03:10.959> of<00:03:11.049> and<00:03:11.230> it<00:03:11.290> uses

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
that you can think of and it uses

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.289 
that you can think of and it uses
physics<00:03:12.099> to<00:03:12.250> keep<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.519> camera<00:03:12.849> steady<00:03:13.030> while

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
physics to keep the camera steady while

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.449 
physics to keep the camera steady while
you<00:03:13.329> move<00:03:13.660> I'm<00:03:14.230> being<00:03:14.769> goofy<00:03:14.980> here<00:03:15.280> in<00:03:15.370> the

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
you move I'm being goofy here in the

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:16.800 
you move I'm being goofy here in the
shot<00:03:15.670> but<00:03:15.819> you<00:03:15.879> can<00:03:16.030> see<00:03:16.180> that<00:03:16.329> the<00:03:16.450> camera

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
shot but you can see that the camera

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.330 
shot but you can see that the camera
stays<00:03:16.989> relatively<00:03:17.680> still<00:03:17.920> even<00:03:18.160> though<00:03:18.250> I'm

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
stays relatively still even though I'm

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.400 
stays relatively still even though I'm
moving<00:03:18.639> around<00:03:18.730> a<00:03:19.030> lot<00:03:19.180> and<00:03:19.450> here's<00:03:20.109> a<00:03:20.170> shot

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
moving around a lot and here's a shot

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.930 
moving around a lot and here's a shot
from<00:03:20.530> the<00:03:20.680> cameras<00:03:21.040> perspective<00:03:21.579> because<00:03:21.700> I'm

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
from the cameras perspective because I'm

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.490 
from the cameras perspective because I'm
pointing<00:03:22.239> it<00:03:22.329> at<00:03:22.389> the<00:03:22.450> mirror<00:03:22.900> there's<00:03:23.410> a

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
pointing it at the mirror there's a

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.410 
pointing it at the mirror there's a
difference<00:03:23.980> between<00:03:24.130> the<00:03:24.489> actual<00:03:24.670> Steadicam

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
difference between the actual Steadicam

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.059 
difference between the actual Steadicam
brand<00:03:25.720> which<00:03:25.900> is<00:03:25.930> now<00:03:26.139> a<00:03:26.170> tiff<00:03:26.440> and<00:03:26.560> brand<00:03:26.829> and

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
brand which is now a tiff and brand and

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.280 
brand which is now a tiff and brand and
other<00:03:27.609> brands<00:03:27.970> such<00:03:28.209> as<00:03:28.239> glide<00:03:28.630> cam<00:03:28.930> and<00:03:29.200> other

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
other brands such as glide cam and other

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.379 
other brands such as glide cam and other
stabilization<00:03:30.040> systems<00:03:30.489> I've<00:03:31.060> personally

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:31.389 
stabilization systems I've personally

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:34.110 
stabilization systems I've personally
used<00:03:31.599> both<00:03:31.870> Steadicam<00:03:32.440> and<00:03:32.709> glide<00:03:33.130> cam<00:03:33.370> and<00:03:33.639> my

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
used both Steadicam and glide cam and my

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.400 
used both Steadicam and glide cam and my
experience<00:03:34.599> has<00:03:34.690> been<00:03:34.720> better<00:03:35.109> with<00:03:35.290> the

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
experience has been better with the

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.970 
experience has been better with the
Steadicam

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
Steadicam

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.309 
Steadicam
I<00:03:36.190> love<00:03:36.700> Steadicam<00:03:37.269> the<00:03:37.630> camera<00:03:37.989> floats

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
I love Steadicam the camera floats

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:39.990 
I love Steadicam the camera floats
through<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:38.650> air<00:03:38.889> and<00:03:39.069> you<00:03:39.190> can<00:03:39.340> get<00:03:39.519> right<00:03:39.819> in

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
through the air and you can get right in

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.819 
through the air and you can get right in
there<00:03:40.150> with<00:03:40.329> the<00:03:40.420> action<00:03:40.870> one<00:03:41.380> morning<00:03:41.709> though

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
there with the action one morning though

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.530 
there with the action one morning though
they<00:03:42.010> aren't<00:03:42.190> easy<00:03:42.489> to<00:03:42.700> use<00:03:42.910> they<00:03:43.120> take<00:03:43.269> a<00:03:43.299> lot

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
they aren't easy to use they take a lot

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.659 
they aren't easy to use they take a lot
of<00:03:43.569> practice<00:03:43.810> I<00:03:44.260> still<00:03:44.950> need<00:03:45.099> to<00:03:45.190> get<00:03:45.310> formal

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:45.669 
of practice I still need to get formal

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:47.009 
of practice I still need to get formal
training<00:03:45.730> myself<00:03:46.150> but<00:03:46.510> it's<00:03:46.630> definitely<00:03:46.780> a

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
training myself but it's definitely a

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.440 
training myself but it's definitely a
lot<00:03:47.290> of<00:03:47.319> fun<00:03:47.620> using<00:03:47.829> these<00:03:48.099> things<00:03:48.340> I<00:03:48.639> want<00:03:49.359> to

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
lot of fun using these things I want to

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.150 
lot of fun using these things I want to
add<00:03:49.540> one<00:03:49.750> big<00:03:49.959> tip<00:03:50.260> here<00:03:50.470> regarding<00:03:50.889> moving

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
add one big tip here regarding moving

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.890 
add one big tip here regarding moving
the<00:03:51.250> camera<00:03:51.459> just<00:03:51.760> generally<00:03:52.329> no<00:03:52.540> matter<00:03:52.690> what

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
the camera just generally no matter what

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.360 
the camera just generally no matter what
system<00:03:53.109> you're<00:03:53.410> using<00:03:53.440> and<00:03:53.919> that<00:03:54.010> is<00:03:54.130> that<00:03:54.280> you

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
system you're using and that is that you

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.610 
system you're using and that is that you
consider<00:03:54.750> starting<00:03:55.750> with<00:03:55.870> the<00:03:55.989> end<00:03:56.200> frame

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
consider starting with the end frame

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.110 
consider starting with the end frame
first<00:03:57.099> and<00:03:57.370> the<00:03:57.430> reason<00:03:57.669> I<00:03:57.760> say<00:03:57.910> that<00:03:57.940> is

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
first and the reason I say that is

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.970 
first and the reason I say that is
because<00:03:58.359> a<00:03:58.540> lot<00:03:58.720> of<00:03:58.780> times<00:03:59.049> the<00:03:59.169> end<00:03:59.349> frame<00:03:59.739> is

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
because a lot of times the end frame is

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.229 
because a lot of times the end frame is
the<00:04:00.370> one<00:04:00.489> that's<00:04:00.609> gonna<00:04:00.730> have<00:04:00.849> the<00:04:01.000> biggest

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
the one that's gonna have the biggest

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.330 
the one that's gonna have the biggest
impact<00:04:01.510> on<00:04:01.959> your<00:04:02.079> audience<00:04:02.260> so<00:04:02.950> if<00:04:03.069> you<00:04:03.160> pick

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
impact on your audience so if you pick

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.490 
impact on your audience so if you pick
that<00:04:03.459> end<00:04:03.639> frame<00:04:04.209> first<00:04:04.540> after<00:04:05.139> the<00:04:05.290> movement

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
that end frame first after the movement

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.979 
that end frame first after the movement
then<00:04:06.310> you<00:04:06.459> can<00:04:06.609> go<00:04:06.760> back<00:04:06.970> and<00:04:07.269> back<00:04:07.540> it<00:04:07.690> up<00:04:07.780> and

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
then you can go back and back it up and

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.599 
then you can go back and back it up and
pick<00:04:08.290> out<00:04:08.470> what<00:04:08.680> your<00:04:08.829> beginning<00:04:09.280> frame<00:04:09.489> is

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609 
pick out what your beginning frame is
