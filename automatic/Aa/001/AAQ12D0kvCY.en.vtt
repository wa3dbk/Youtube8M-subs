00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.570
 you said we're here now to 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.100
 few hours a few minutes 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.140
 leave at the period be an hour 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.210
 in front of the press so what you can 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.399
 explain us a little more precisely 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.880
 it will consist almost very web 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.579
 quickly so in celebration this tuesday is 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.989
 reserved for the press and thus to 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.130
 bloggers in almost blogger 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.510
 basically it's great there is no 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.370
 that people talk about bing sport 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.070
 became a portion this project said proud 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.079
 no but no game one or what so 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.059
 it's really global so we 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.730
 as a blogger and sent by 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.050
 so millenium let's go we'll see the right 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.370
 in quotation marks to go this evening 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.110
 which is therefore reserved and so suddenly 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.879
 will have much less time for them 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.559
 games including the games we would like 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.360
 test in loss and especially to leucate 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.779
 assassin's creed then personally 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.249
 these two games that I want to test 

00:01:05.779 --> 00:01:10.770
 I was using that so used almost 

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:11.670
 no time waiting for a little while 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.770
 to wait is that she does not want 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.539
 see none except for Corsican but 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.700
 surely the cause of one expects when 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:18.780
 even to a big queue in front of the goal of 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.490
 the tent 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.540
 it's not that it's also the beginning of 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.240
 sw is sure magna and on starcraft me 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.350
 so here is there anyway there is 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.890
 still beautiful people to see too 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.670
 a lot of contacts 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.450
 yeah we go it is that I looked 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.890
 nobody in particular 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.509
 it's clear barak is expected to see 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.890
 especially all the big youtuber between 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.960
 quotes squeeze band with two hundred 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.549
 thousand subscribers or even ready even 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.990
 maybe why not huge did some 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.280

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.740
 displacement and all had a big 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.270
 pleasure 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.539
 then we are immersed it's my cousin 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.770
 which is not a problem we should be able to 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:56.970
 do a good little media content even 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.740

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.840
 tired is that from 19 hours to midnight 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.810
 so we do not have a lot of 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.399
 time to provide everyone even though 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.420

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:21.560

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:30.019
 exactly to all of you go on 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.250
 now to testing video games because 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.319
 yes, the paris games week is also 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.000
 that the test of video games that are 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:36.380
 sometimes go out sometimes not there it's 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.880
 assassin's creed with a little guy is 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.980
 made by dimps so the game is already 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.319
 pulled out exactly where there is a small 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.489
 gameplay a good apple time standards 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.930
 I'm going to take you in the course of 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.549
 part of which can not offer two 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.349
 combat phases in any case graphic 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.870
 throw a big fat slap 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:52.069
 and we can say the same for halo 4 I 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.930
 think we had the chance to 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.090
 test in multiplayer in the sky yeah 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.260
 it is clear intimate it is towards 10 is ya 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.540
 the cac so huge 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.889
 by 32 in rooms 32 actually is 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.239
 came back was 2 4 against 4 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:03.379
 you will show my team am 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.000
 super happy because I'm really 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:07.069
 number one in the water and I found the game 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.230
 super I think these two are going to be 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:09.859
 the two big successes we spread out 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.629
 2012 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:12.680
 and there we are a conference actually 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.750
 before playing you see quickly 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.039
 in quality not great because 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.470
 here is a little in the dark I 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:20.120
 I'm sorry and to finish dims we have 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.070
 could see the wii or console that can 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.419
 not badly expected exactly one 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.340
 console that are waiting for a typical team 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:27.139
 happy everything and also some doubts to 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.430
 this console is a principle is simple 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.889
 it's a living room console a bit like 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.560
 wii was transferred directly without 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:35.690
 cut his party on a portable console 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.520
 who is touch so plus be 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.419
 interesting and I can not wait to see that but 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.410
 it's not the buzz is not the thing 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.710
 This is perhaps the talent is made thereto 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.710
 difference 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.190
 we found very personalities 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.870

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.250

 pretty true photo tell what they know 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.190

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.570
 we had also suffered these nuts two 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.100
