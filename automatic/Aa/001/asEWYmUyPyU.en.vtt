it'll<00:01:28.020> be<00:01:28.110> frustrating<00:01:28.619> at<00:01:28.710> first<00:01:28.920> when<00:01:29.070> you

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
it'll be frustrating at first when you

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.679 
it'll be frustrating at first when you
missed<00:01:29.340> targets<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:29.939> died<00:01:30.090> because<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.479> it

missed targets and died because of it

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.899 
missed targets and died because of it
but<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.320> definitely<00:01:31.470> worth<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.790> end

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
but it is definitely worth it in the end

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.690 
but it is definitely worth it in the end
to<00:01:33.210> get<00:01:33.299> good<00:01:33.600> with<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:33.990> weapon<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.640> play<00:01:35.640> on

accordingly<00:04:00.209> now<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.540> after<00:04:01.170> your<00:04:01.739> initial

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
accordingly now the after your initial

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.100 
accordingly now the after your initial
two<00:04:02.310> TV<00:04:02.700> missiles<00:04:03.120> this<00:04:03.300> is<00:04:03.480> important<00:04:03.930> it

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
two TV missiles this is important it

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.710 
two TV missiles this is important it
takes<00:04:04.380> quite<00:04:04.739> a<00:04:04.920> while<00:04:05.040> to<00:04:05.250> reload<00:04:05.880> before<00:04:06.450> you

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
takes quite a while to reload before you

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.449 
takes quite a while to reload before you
start<00:04:06.930> getting<00:04:07.020> TV<00:04:07.350> missiles<00:04:07.739> back<00:04:07.890> again<00:04:08.250> so

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
start getting TV missiles back again so

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.430 
start getting TV missiles back again so
really<00:04:09.180> think<00:04:09.450> about<00:04:09.510> this<00:04:09.780> don't<00:04:10.020> be<00:04:10.110> wasting

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
really think about this don't be wasting

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.449 
really think about this don't be wasting
your<00:04:10.530> TV<00:04:10.739> missiles<00:04:11.040> trying<00:04:11.250> to<00:04:11.310> go<00:04:11.370> after

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
your TV missiles trying to go after

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:12.470 
your TV missiles trying to go after
choppers<00:04:11.940> they're<00:04:12.090> really<00:04:12.239> not<00:04:12.330> that

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
choppers they're really not that

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.000 
choppers they're really not that
effective<00:04:12.720> against<00:04:13.170> them<00:04:13.290> and<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.770> burst

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
effective against them and the burst

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.440 
effective against them and the burst
candidate<00:04:14.400> is<00:04:14.489> way<00:04:14.640> better<00:04:14.790> for<00:04:15.060> this<00:04:15.150> plus

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
candidate is way better for this plus

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.909 
candidate is way better for this plus
you're<00:04:15.570> gonna<00:04:15.660> miss<00:04:15.930> most<00:04:16.169> of<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:16.350> time<00:04:16.560> it's

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
you're gonna miss most of the time it's

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.460 
you're gonna miss most of the time it's
just<00:04:17.100> a<00:04:17.190> waste<00:04:17.370> so<00:04:18.000> think<00:04:18.750> about<00:04:18.900> your<00:04:19.200> TV

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
just a waste so think about your TV

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.080 
just a waste so think about your TV
missiles<00:04:19.890> before<00:04:20.010> you<00:04:20.280> just<00:04:20.430> spawn<00:04:20.700> in<00:04:20.880> star

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
missiles before you just spawn in star

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.550 
missiles before you just spawn in star
launch<00:04:21.330> them<00:04:21.570> across<00:04:21.720> the<00:04:21.930> map<00:04:22.080> at<00:04:22.229> random

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
launch them across the map at random

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.710 
launch them across the map at random
targets<00:04:22.919> if<00:04:23.400> an<00:04:23.580> enemy<00:04:23.729> attack<00:04:24.120> boat<00:04:24.330> rounds

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720

the<00:04:24.810> corner<00:04:25.169> coming<00:04:25.380> at<00:04:25.560> you<00:04:25.740> and<00:04:25.919> you<00:04:26.070> still

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
the corner coming at you and you still

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.810 
the corner coming at you and you still
have

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
have

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.550 
have
20<00:04:27.120> seconds<00:04:27.480> to<00:04:27.540> your<00:04:27.600> TV<00:04:27.840> missiles<00:04:28.260> come<00:04:28.410> back

20 seconds to your TV missiles come back

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.650 
20 seconds to your TV missiles come back
you're<00:04:29.070> in<00:04:29.190> trouble<00:04:29.550> because<00:04:29.760> if<00:04:30.210> he's

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
you're in trouble because if he's

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.480 
you're in trouble because if he's
already<00:04:30.840> gunning<00:04:31.230> for<00:04:31.260> you<00:04:31.530> it's<00:04:31.890> probably

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
already gunning for you it's probably

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:33.860 
already gunning for you it's probably
gonna<00:04:32.670> be<00:04:32.820> tough<00:04:33.000> for<00:04:33.120> you<00:04:33.180> to<00:04:33.210> get<00:04:33.420> away<00:04:33.510> and
