going to be how to pone with the ump45
and<00:01:22.040> the<00:01:23.040> way<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:24.229> what<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.259> used<00:01:25.470> in<00:01:25.560> this<00:01:25.619> video

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
and the way I what I used in this video

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.160 
and the way I what I used in this video
was<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.460> new<00:01:26.610> p45<00:01:27.030> rapid-fire<00:01:27.509> default<00:01:27.960> class

third<00:01:36.990> perk<00:01:37.259> but<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.890> that's<00:01:38.070> not<00:01:38.310> really

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
third perk but that that's not really

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.429

its<00:01:48.960> rate<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.380> fire<00:01:49.649> it's<00:01:49.950> not<00:01:50.009> as<00:01:50.340> high<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:51.020> so

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
its rate of fire it's not as high and so

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.859 
its rate of fire it's not as high and so
rapid-fire<00:01:52.380> just<00:01:52.710> makes<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.009> like<00:01:53.869> literally

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
rapid-fire just makes it like literally

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.780 
rapid-fire just makes it like literally
like<00:01:55.110> just<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.439> keeps<00:01:55.649> pounding<00:01:55.920> out<00:01:56.280> bullets

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
like just it keeps pounding out bullets

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.730 
like just it keeps pounding out bullets
and<00:01:57.030> it's<00:01:57.420> unstoppable<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.259> it's<00:01:58.380> like<00:01:58.469> like

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
and it's unstoppable and it's like like

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.219 
and it's unstoppable and it's like like
a<00:01:58.829> three<00:01:59.040> shot<00:01:59.219> kill<00:01:59.460> pretty<00:01:59.670> much<00:01:59.990> if<00:02:00.990> you

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
a three shot kill pretty much if you

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.440 
a three shot kill pretty much if you
like<00:02:01.439> him<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.799> chest<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.280> um

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
like him to the chest and um

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.620 
like him to the chest and um
yeah<00:02:05.439> so<00:02:05.829> if<00:02:06.280> you<00:02:06.610> use<00:02:06.729> rapid<00:02:07.060> fire<00:02:07.210> on<00:02:07.390> it<00:02:07.509> you

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
yeah so if you use rapid fire on it you

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.350 
yeah so if you use rapid fire on it you
should<00:02:07.780> be<00:02:07.840> fine<00:02:08.080> but<00:02:08.860> now<00:02:09.489> that<00:02:09.700> I<00:02:09.729> found<00:02:09.940> that

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
should be fine but now that I found that

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.680 
should be fine but now that I found that
I<00:02:10.629> get<00:02:11.260> at<00:02:12.040> unless<00:02:12.730> des<00:02:13.000> if<00:02:13.209> I<00:02:13.300> use<00:02:13.420> a<00:02:13.450> silencer

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
I get at unless des if I use a silencer

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.160 
I get at unless des if I use a silencer
which<00:02:14.080> is<00:02:14.379> common<00:02:14.830> sense<00:02:14.980> but<00:02:15.300> um<00:02:16.300> this<00:02:16.989> is<00:02:17.140> my

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
things are waste and stuff but I yes so

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.500 
things are waste and stuff but I yes so
in<00:03:29.380> my<00:03:29.799> opinion<00:03:29.920> if<00:03:30.910> you're<00:03:31.209> going<00:03:31.299> to<00:03:31.359> use

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
in my opinion if you're going to use

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.840 
in my opinion if you're going to use
like<00:03:31.660> a<00:03:31.750> gun<00:03:31.989> like<00:03:32.170> a<00:03:32.230> unity<00:03:32.500> 45<00:03:32.859> this

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
like a gun like a unity 45 this

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.900 
like a gun like a unity 45 this
lightweight<00:03:34.410> huge<00:03:35.410> on<00:03:35.709> at<00:03:36.130> least<00:03:36.400> if<00:03:36.639> you<00:03:36.730> make

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
lightweight huge on at least if you make

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.250 
lightweight huge on at least if you make
more<00:03:37.180> than<00:03:37.239> one<00:03:37.359> class<00:03:37.540> with<00:03:37.780> that<00:03:37.900> one<00:03:38.170> of

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
more than one class with that one of

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.569 
more than one class with that one of
them<00:03:38.380> should<00:03:38.530> have<00:03:38.769> extreme<00:03:39.069> conditioning

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
them should have extreme conditioning

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:41.819 
them should have extreme conditioning
because<00:03:39.840> with<00:03:40.840> this<00:03:40.959> gun<00:03:41.200> and<00:03:41.440> some<00:03:41.560> it's

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
because with this gun and some it's

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.920 
because with this gun and some it's
really<00:03:42.130> fun<00:03:42.519> to<00:03:42.549> rush<00:03:43.180> around<00:03:43.209> with<00:03:43.630> it<00:03:43.780> and

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
really fun to rush around with it and

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.280 
really fun to rush around with it and
just<00:03:44.680> so<00:03:44.799> I<00:03:44.859> completely<00:03:45.310> like<00:03:45.750> kill<00:03:46.750> people<00:03:47.049> so

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
just so I completely like kill people so

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.220 
just so I completely like kill people so
I<00:03:47.530> recommend<00:03:47.920> if<00:03:48.400> you<00:03:48.609> use<00:03:48.940> the<00:03:49.420> extreme

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
I recommend if you use the extreme

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.629 
I recommend if you use the extreme
conditioning<00:03:50.620> perk<00:03:50.829> for<00:03:51.010> slot<00:03:51.190> 1<00:03:51.370> you<00:03:51.489> should

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:51.639 
conditioning perk for slot 1 you should

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:53.849 
conditioning perk for slot 1 you should
use<00:03:51.819> quick<00:03:52.120> draw<00:03:52.359> for<00:03:52.569> slot<00:03:52.750> too<00:03:52.959> because

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
use quick draw for slot too because

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:55.259 
use quick draw for slot too because
quick<00:03:54.130> straw<00:03:54.340> helps<00:03:54.609> you<00:03:54.670> pull<00:03:54.910> if<00:03:55.000> you<00:03:55.090> count

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
quick straw helps you pull if you count

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.809 
quick straw helps you pull if you count
faster<00:03:55.660> and<00:03:55.900> it<00:03:56.769> just<00:03:57.040> completely<00:03:57.519> gives<00:03:57.760> you

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
faster and it just completely gives you

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.780 
faster and it just completely gives you
the<00:03:57.940> advantage<00:03:58.030> when<00:03:58.480> rushing<00:03:58.840> I<00:03:59.700> sort<00:04:00.700> of

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
the advantage when rushing I sort of

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.370 
the advantage when rushing I sort of
become<00:04:01.060> stupid<00:04:01.389> here<00:04:01.569> and<00:04:01.750> I<00:04:01.900> go<00:04:02.079> for<00:04:02.230> one<00:04:02.319> of

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
become stupid here and I go for one of

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.870 
become stupid here and I go for one of
the<00:04:02.470> care<00:04:02.590> packages<00:04:03.040> with<00:04:03.400> even<00:04:03.639> with<00:04:03.730> its

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
the care packages with even with its

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.569 
the care packages with even with its
Osprey<00:04:04.269> gunner<00:04:04.480> protecting<00:04:05.230> it<00:04:05.319> I<00:04:05.579> was

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
of kind of like a pavelow from MW

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.930 
of kind of like a pavelow from MW
because<00:05:43.140> it<00:05:43.320> actually<00:05:43.440> shoots<00:05:43.740> it<00:05:43.950> everyone

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
because it actually shoots it everyone

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
to point out that when the ump45 does

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.190 
to point out that when the ump45 does
not<00:06:01.890> have<00:06:02.100> rapid<00:06:02.490> fire<00:06:02.700> it<00:06:03.030> takes<00:06:04.020> a<00:06:04.169> lot

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200 
not have rapid fire it takes a lot

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.740 
not have rapid fire it takes a lot
longer<00:06:04.950> to<00:06:05.250> kill<00:06:05.520> so<00:06:06.270> if<00:06:06.360> you're<00:06:06.480> going<00:06:06.600> to<00:06:06.660> use

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
longer to kill so if you're going to use

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.450 
longer to kill so if you're going to use
it<00:06:06.900> without<00:06:07.020> rapid<00:06:07.560> fire<00:06:07.710> i<00:06:07.980> would<00:06:08.100> recommend

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
it without rapid fire i would recommend

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.540 
it without rapid fire i would recommend
having<00:06:08.640> a<00:06:08.820> silencer<00:06:09.300> on<00:06:09.330> it<00:06:09.480> because<00:06:10.410> if<00:06:11.160> you

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
having a silencer on it because if you

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.430 
having a silencer on it because if you
seize<00:06:11.730> it<00:06:11.820> without<00:06:12.000> rapid<00:06:12.270> fire<00:06:12.419> it's<00:06:13.020> gonna

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
seize it without rapid fire it's gonna

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.290 
seize it without rapid fire it's gonna
get<00:06:13.650> like<00:06:13.800> three<00:06:14.490> shots<00:06:14.669> on<00:06:14.850> a<00:06:14.910> person<00:06:15.180> before

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
get like three shots on a person before

get like three shots on a person before
they<00:06:15.510> kill<00:06:15.660> you<00:06:15.780> with<00:06:15.900> their<00:06:16.020> assault<00:06:16.260> rifle
