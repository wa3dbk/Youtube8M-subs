00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.800
 please be kind enough now 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.570
 to something very cool namely this elfi 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.949
 camera to world of warcraft you have 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.449
 Certainly that's what belongs to it 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.760
 should come 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.380
 111 ii is when you take a picture of yourself 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.300
 I usually liked to do that myself 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.160
 on facebook looks like saying say 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.560
 doug face to any for that 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.719
 Toilets do not really reflect 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.489
 nice pictures that's just this 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.520
 because someone is just himself 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.050
 have photographed and you can 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.629
 in world of warcraft 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.370
 there is a self camera here 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.280
 I'm making a bit of music quieter 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.480
 somehow they have that again 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.020
 they are so loud again 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.120
 Made it all so now it is on 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.719
 It does not want to be a bit more pleasant 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.390
 exaggerate 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.649
 so there is this this elfi camera 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.390
 now in world of warcraft and that 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.070
 I wanted to show you this once 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.870
 basically where you get them 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.810
 you get the normal farmer 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.200
 mission table if you have the luck 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.909
 to get a mission and have to 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.159
 send her a trailer 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.500
 he'll pick you up then this camera i can 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.720
 Do not say how the mission is called me 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.790
 looked at so photography falls 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.520
 the whole then you get the first one 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.670
 version here your camera there are two 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.710
 the first level is that 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.570
 here and that is here here 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.939
 he is this elfi camera and then there is 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.650
 another update to that is also one 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.689
 mission you have to be lucky too 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.180
 and you get after three color pictures 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.520
 and then you have an epic the 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.259
 but can add as a toy 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.360
 also the first version of this elfi 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.829
 Camera works and you have to 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.750
 Just wait for that always that 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.430
 lucky that the upgrade is still to come 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.680
 and then you get one more 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.630
 better so if now believed that 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.380
 whole is about as a disappointment 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.600
 like the harfst strategy for the harpist 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.909
 and board the harp and cards where 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.560
 or the dance studio where at the end nothing 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.630
 It really happened that was easy 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.119
 only strolling things knew this art 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.310
 draws an epic card 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.860
 then I have to disappoint because this elfi 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.870
 Camera actually works and 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.280
 we'll do some space for that 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.379
 Here we are from here 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:24.290
 And we do not want that in the picture 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:26.060
 so have your mini-deep release so 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.940
 and now we try it all the time 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.329
 out and that is now this elfi 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.730
 camera and you can already see the 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:37.310
 gnome now owns the camera itself 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.900
 direction always next time something 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.650
 heard I do it louder otherwise 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:45.530
 It can really hear that environment 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:50.810
 quietly so now you hear the water now 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:03:03.140
 first of all on it one can therefore photos 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:03:05.390
 make this is to break if 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.549
 her because the upgrade is still okay that is 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.500
 quieter now a bit loud 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.579
 if we update now 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.349
 then you can him too 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:14.690
 choose color filter there is once the 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:18.230
 black and white filter the deaths filter and 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.419
 the sketch filter as well as me 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.150
 should also have luck this color filter 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:25.519
 to catch and I would you the 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.530
 I'd like to introduce myself 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.169
 the whole time as possible with 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.379
 many council the mission too 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:34.579
 accelerate to get that 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:36.049
 By the way, you're probably wondering what 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:38.930
 happened then it was now 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.970
 here everything is no it actually becomes one 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.310
 screenshot made with it ends up and 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.010
 your screenshot folder inside and there 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.069
 then you can just bring it out 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.230
 there is a presumption that the whole 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:54.650
 also get the twitter connection 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.540
 yes yes you say is probably but 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.069
 even the normal screenshots 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.299
 maybe there will be one here 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.720
 button emerge 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:04.639
 the best to share on twitter 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.769
 for example, the pp still on the 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:07.940
 stage has left so that you have that 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.060
 I do not have weight yet 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.040
 tried what happens when the pp 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.829
 on the head and and then this 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.019
 elfi camera used 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:21.049
 to 11 there it was just there was such a 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:25.940
 action join in a squeaky elfi and now 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:30.680
 You know why that's the way you can do it 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:34.389
 now with people here 111 email opel is 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:37.280
 not quite so exactly is not quite 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:40.000
 well here in the picture 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.199
 you have to wait a bit like that and 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.060
 Of course, everything else becomes if you 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:45.590
 the picture then fades out that 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.830
 Here you can see on the screenshot 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.870
 not and that she does not chat too 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.889
 and all that really only looks 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.449
 your gnome here or your blood l ever 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:05:00.710
 what kind of character you have 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:01.419
 can me just once more here and here and 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.419
 here 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:07.099
 fact is that they click too fast 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:09.800
 klick click is equal to the hard drive 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:14.690
 Yes, I do not know well 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:15.710
 so people and me we will become 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.940
 now only represent one 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:21.229
 Do some photos here with the 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:23.000
 great self camera as well as me in the times 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:25.550
 should come enjoyable and I go Yes 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.770
 already on the color filter to catch 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.870
 so what does it already known in the 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.940
 black and white sketch would me times 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.979
 Interested in a comic style 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.270
 anyway sketch should look like 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:40.290
 and exactly 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.730
 finally the death filter that 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.590
 It would be very interesting there it will be 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:46.860
 probably there is something like that 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:50.070
 objects that allow it, for example, everything 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.870
 still in the cathedral to see and so what and 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:54.690
 probably will be something and so 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.400
 like me that time you'll filter this 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.610
 I like to introduce you to them 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.940
 so I'm saying yes and up to 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.940
 knowledge
