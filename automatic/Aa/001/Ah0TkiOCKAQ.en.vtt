 we invent we take out but well we're going to 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.730
 this case put it here is a micro sim or 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.450

 if the divisions of the measures are 128 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:57.120
 millimeters x 64 x 10.6 bone is let's say 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.970
 falls within the category of 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.220
 Delgaditos in the back is 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.690

 screen is 4.3 inches and the 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:24.180
 resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels is a 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.180
 pretty high solution 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.400
 it is of course this has a 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.890
 protection put a cover that is 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.750

 the wifi is there and we are going to make a 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.769
 wifi network 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:44.809

 and lower the port with the button on the 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.670
 camera to load it you have to open the 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.470

 of course return as they already dressed him 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.410
 they are a picture here logically 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:27.699
 very fast 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:27.699
 the photo here 

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:33.899
 the noise of course is the wine that 

00:06:31.679 --> 00:06:38.069
 you can remove that is basically a 

00:06:33.899 --> 00:06:40.499
 very fast view to this that is the sony 

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:42.179
 xperia that just just arrived that 

00:06:40.499 --> 00:06:45.509
 has the sim let's set up accounts 

00:06:42.179 --> 00:06:47.610

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:50.689
 give more comments from this team to 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.689
 sorry I forgot 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:57.810
 size 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:07:02.099
 here is a bowl or an iphone or more 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:05.460
 go galaxy nexus and a good explore already 

00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:07.680
 that and we see that more or less there he gives the 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.840
 next stop bit to let me leave 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:14.340
 Take pictures saying hey, it's already here 

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:18.000
 the nexus is a little bit bigger there 

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:19.409
 you can see all this edge in thickness 

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.849
 this is a little thinner this 

00:07:19.409 --> 00:07:23.009
 part because it has in the bottom 

00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:26.729
 more chubby and thinner this is 

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:28.229
 continuous and good that is the size the 

00:07:26.729 --> 00:07:29.939
 comparative among other models we have 

00:07:28.229 --> 00:07:31.349
 here and good we already have them using 

00:07:29.939 --> 00:07:34.810
 we will try our comments of 

00:07:31.349 --> 00:07:37.800
 this one is the xperia the set who is 

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:37.800
 point
