00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
like a wind starter I always thought

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.070 
like a wind starter I always thought
that'd<00:01:23.759> be<00:01:23.790> pretty<00:01:24.030> cool<00:01:24.150> but<00:01:24.479> they<00:01:24.630> won't<00:01:24.840> you

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100

probably<00:01:30.960> Charizard<00:01:31.470> too<00:01:31.650> when<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.040> play<00:01:32.220> the

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
probably Charizard too when you play the

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.069 
probably Charizard too when you play the
original<00:01:32.759> version<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.540> new<00:01:33.720> ones<00:01:33.930> I

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
original version and the new ones I

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.450 
original version and the new ones I
haven't<00:01:34.350> really<00:01:34.530> played<00:01:34.680> like<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.070> black<00:01:35.280> and

white<00:01:35.579> ones<00:01:35.850> I'm<00:01:36.360> really<00:01:36.990> tempted<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.650> pick

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
white ones I'm really tempted to pick

myself in difficult situations I don't
know<00:06:58.460> why<00:06:58.610> but<00:06:58.880> I<00:06:58.940> guess<00:06:59.150> I<00:06:59.240> tend<00:06:59.449> to<00:06:59.479> do<00:06:59.630> that

00:06:59.770 --> 00:06:59.780 
know why but I guess I tend to do that

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.270 
know why but I guess I tend to do that
sometimes<00:07:00.169> so<00:07:00.349> just<00:07:00.410> go<00:07:00.650> ahead<00:07:00.680> and<00:07:00.919> run<00:07:01.069> past

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 
sometimes so just go ahead and run past

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.490 
sometimes so just go ahead and run past
this<00:07:01.460> take<00:07:01.880> a<00:07:01.910> dive<00:07:02.180> and<00:07:02.539> look<00:07:02.720> I<00:07:03.050> managed<00:07:03.470> to

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:03.500 
this take a dive and look I managed to

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.170 
this take a dive and look I managed to
get<00:07:03.680> it<00:07:03.830> isn't<00:07:03.979> that<00:07:04.009> ridiculous<00:07:04.490> going<00:07:05.120> to

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:05.180 
get it isn't that ridiculous going to

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.939 
get it isn't that ridiculous going to
stomp<00:07:05.389> these<00:07:05.539> spiders<00:07:05.990> I<00:07:06.169> put<00:07:06.349> stump<00:07:06.620> for<00:07:06.830> this

00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:06.949

one<00:07:07.190> punch<00:07:07.490> the<00:07:07.699> next<00:07:07.940> one<00:07:08.120> basically<00:07:08.810> you

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:08.900 
one punch the next one basically you

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.450
