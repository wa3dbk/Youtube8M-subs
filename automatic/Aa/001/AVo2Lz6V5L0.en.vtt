itself so when you see it it kind of

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.690 
itself so when you see it it kind of
looks<00:00:35.670> like<00:00:36.020> the<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.739> came<00:00:37.950> from<00:00:38.160> Apple<00:00:38.489> it

looks like the it came from Apple it

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.729 
looks like the it came from Apple it
kind<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:38.969> looks<00:00:39.120> like<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.480> iPad<00:00:39.899> was<00:00:40.079> made<00:00:40.379> for

is<00:01:33.689> on<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.049> it's<00:01:35.009> worth<00:01:35.189> noting<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.960> it<00:01:36.960> has

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
is on and it's worth noting that it has

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.569 
is on and it's worth noting that it has
a<00:01:37.170> rechargeable<00:01:37.439> battery<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.400> way<00:01:38.520> you

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
a rechargeable battery and the way you

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.510 

I<00:02:22.140> can<00:02:22.770> have<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.910> keyboard<00:02:24.210> show<00:02:24.390> up<00:02:24.540> as

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
I can have the keyboard show up as

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.330 
I can have the keyboard show up as
needed<00:02:26.520> or<00:02:27.140> remove<00:02:28.140> it<00:02:28.260> so<00:02:29.070> when<00:02:29.220> you're

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
needed or remove it so when you're

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.010 
needed or remove it so when you're
browsing<00:02:29.520> and<00:02:29.910> keyboard<00:02:30.420> just<00:02:30.540> pops<00:02:30.690> up<00:02:30.840> by

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
browsing and keyboard just pops up by

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.590 
browsing and keyboard just pops up by
itself<00:02:31.170> that<00:02:32.070> kind<00:02:32.280> of<00:02:32.340> thing<00:02:32.520> it<00:02:33.420> actually

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
itself that kind of thing it actually

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.750 
itself that kind of thing it actually
also<00:02:34.050> even<00:02:34.560> has<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.710> button<00:02:35.070> to<00:02:35.250> allow<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:35.580> to

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
also even has a button to allow you to

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.540 
also even has a button to allow you to
switch<00:02:35.850> between<00:02:35.970> languages<00:02:37.550> international

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
switch between languages international

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.890 
switch between languages international
owed<00:02:39.320> so<00:02:40.320> as<00:02:40.500> I<00:02:40.620> mentioned<00:02:40.650> before<00:02:41.900> the

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
owed so as I mentioned before the

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.420 
owed so as I mentioned before the
difference<00:02:43.200> between<00:02:43.650> this<00:02:43.980> and<00:02:44.040> some<00:02:44.310> of<00:02:44.340> the

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
difference between this and some of the

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.880 
difference between this and some of the
other<00:02:44.550> case<00:02:44.850> keyboard<00:02:45.180> combos<00:02:45.780> is<00:02:45.930> that<00:02:46.590> we

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
other case keyboard combos is that we

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.300 
other case keyboard combos is that we
can<00:02:47.070> easily<00:02:47.760> just<00:02:48.210> switch<00:02:48.800> between<00:02:49.800> landscape

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
can easily just switch between landscape

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.610 
can easily just switch between landscape
and<00:02:50.640> portrait<00:02:50.820> mode<00:02:51.570> and<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:51.930> think<00:02:52.380> this<00:02:52.440> comes

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
and portrait mode and I think this comes

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.890 
and portrait mode and I think this comes
in<00:02:52.770> really<00:02:52.890> handy<00:02:53.720> depending<00:02:54.720> on<00:02:54.720> the

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
in really handy depending on the

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.570 
in really handy depending on the
application<00:02:55.200> that<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:55.530> need<00:02:55.710> the<00:02:56.010> typing<00:02:56.400> for

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
application that you need the typing for

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.400 
application that you need the typing for
but<00:02:56.820> the<00:02:57.210> fact<00:02:57.420> that<00:02:57.510> you're<00:02:57.690> able<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:58.200> do<00:02:58.290> it

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
but the fact that you're able to do it

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.440 
but the fact that you're able to do it
I'm<00:02:58.800> big<00:02:59.130> believer<00:02:59.460> in<00:02:59.580> the<00:02:59.880> more<00:03:00.120> features

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
I'm big believer in the more features

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.240 
I'm big believer in the more features
you<00:03:00.540> have<00:03:00.570> the<00:03:00.870> better<00:03:00.990> so<00:03:01.590> even<00:03:02.130> though<00:03:02.160> you

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
you have the better so even though you

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.610 
you have the better so even though you
may<00:03:02.430> not<00:03:02.459> think<00:03:02.610> it's<00:03:03.180> that<00:03:03.540> critical<00:03:04.200> the

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
may not think it's that critical the

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.320 
may not think it's that critical the
fact<00:03:04.860> that<00:03:04.980> it<00:03:05.220> gives<00:03:06.060> you<00:03:06.209> that

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
fact that it gives you that

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.970 
fact that it gives you that
functionality<00:03:06.810> I<00:03:07.170> think<00:03:07.410> is<00:03:07.500> a<00:03:07.530> tremendous

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
functionality I think is a tremendous

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.370 
functionality I think is a tremendous
plus<00:03:08.240> so<00:03:09.770> that's<00:03:10.770> pretty<00:03:10.920> much<00:03:11.100> it<00:03:11.160> for<00:03:11.310> this

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
plus so that's pretty much it for this

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.590 
plus so that's pretty much it for this
case<00:03:13.380> keyboard<00:03:13.770> combo<00:03:14.280> one<00:03:14.820> thing<00:03:14.970> I<00:03:15.060> didn't

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
case keyboard combo one thing I didn't

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.210 
case keyboard combo one thing I didn't
mention<00:03:15.630> is<00:03:16.020> that<00:03:16.050> it<00:03:16.290> actually<00:03:16.620> has<00:03:16.890> little

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
mention is that it actually has little

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.370 
mention is that it actually has little
LED<00:03:17.640> status<00:03:18.270> lights<00:03:18.630> here<00:03:18.780> that<00:03:18.990> tell<00:03:19.200> you

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
LED status lights here that tell you

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.410 
LED status lights here that tell you
when<00:03:20.190> charging<00:03:20.730> when<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:20.940> battery<00:03:21.270> is<00:03:21.330> low

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
when charging when the battery is low

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.960 
when charging when the battery is low
and<00:03:21.870> when<00:03:22.440> it's<00:03:22.560> working<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:23.130> I'm<00:03:23.670> just<00:03:23.850> going

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
to go and go ahead and shut it off and

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.650 
to go and go ahead and shut it off and

place it right inside again the tension

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.920 
place it right inside again the tension
holds<00:03:36.840> it<00:03:36.930> into<00:03:37.080> place<00:03:37.290> so<00:03:38.100> it's<00:03:38.519> pretty<00:03:38.930> seems

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
holds it into place so it's pretty seems

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.190 
holds it into place so it's pretty seems
pretty<00:03:40.200> tight<00:03:40.560> seems<00:03:41.250> like<00:03:41.400> it's<00:03:41.580> pretty

pretty tight seems like it's pretty
secure<00:03:43.200> I'm<00:03:43.320> not<00:03:43.530> thrilled<00:03:43.950> with<00:03:44.160> it<00:03:44.220> but<00:03:44.459> it's

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
secure I'm not thrilled with it but it's

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.130
