00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:52.669 
production that's relatively consistent

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:54.039 
production that's relatively consistent
you're<00:02:52.790> shooting<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.269> ball<00:02:53.419> less<00:02:53.689> from<00:02:53.930> the

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
you're shooting the ball less from the

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.110 
you're shooting the ball less from the
field<00:02:54.319> but<00:02:54.530> you're<00:02:54.829> still<00:02:55.010> averaging<00:02:55.459> 17<00:02:55.939> and

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
field but you're still averaging 17 and

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.119 
field but you're still averaging 17 and
11<00:02:56.329> which<00:02:56.599> is<00:02:56.750> more<00:02:56.930> than<00:02:57.049> respectable<00:02:57.349> but

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
11 which is more than respectable but

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:00.220 
11 which is more than respectable but
you're<00:02:58.280> shooting<00:02:58.689> 49.6%<00:02:59.689> from<00:03:00.139> the

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
you're shooting 49.6% from the

you're shooting 49.6% from the
free-throw<00:03:00.409> line<00:03:00.620> what<00:03:01.459> is<00:03:01.609> that<00:03:01.790> about<00:03:01.939> is

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
free-throw line what is that about is

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:03.640 
free-throw line what is that about is
that<00:03:02.329> about<00:03:02.629> your<00:03:02.870> conditioning<00:03:03.379> is<00:03:03.500> that

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
that about your conditioning is that

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.189 
that about your conditioning is that
about<00:03:03.889> the<00:03:04.099> shoulder<00:03:04.519> the<00:03:04.909> back<00:03:05.120> or<00:03:05.599> something

about the shoulder the back or something

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:08.890 
about the shoulder the back or something

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:12.859 
because everybody saying I can't shoot

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:14.920 
because everybody saying I can't shoot
free<00:03:13.159> throws<00:03:13.189> and<00:03:14.000> it<00:03:14.269> says<00:03:14.449> she's<00:03:14.629> going<00:03:14.840> to
