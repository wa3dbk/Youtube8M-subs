here<00:03:29.189> you<00:03:30.189> can<00:03:32.189> create<00:03:33.189> sparks<00:03:33.639> get<00:03:34.060> a<00:03:34.090> fire

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
here you can create sparks get a fire

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:37.649 
here you can create sparks get a fire
going<00:03:34.629> you<00:03:35.349> can't<00:03:35.560> remove<00:03:35.769> this<00:03:35.980> as<00:03:36.159> well<00:03:36.659> if

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:37.659 
going you can't remove this as well if

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:42.020 
going you can't remove this as well if
you<00:03:37.810> need<00:03:37.989> to<00:03:38.049> replace<00:03:38.290> it<00:03:38.530> if<00:03:38.650> it<00:03:38.739> runs<00:03:38.919> light

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:50.009 

comes<00:03:43.030> with<00:03:43.150> this<00:03:45.629> so<00:03:46.799> this<00:03:47.799> pan<00:03:48.219> can<00:03:49.019> also

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
comes with this so this pan can also

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.000 
comes with this so this pan can also
convert<00:03:50.790> to

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.880 

a<00:03:54.069> nice<00:03:55.030> little<00:03:55.239> compact<00:03:55.720> keychain<00:03:56.409> Pam<00:03:57.540> which

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
a nice little compact keychain Pam which

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.350 
a nice little compact keychain Pam which
could<00:03:59.890> still<00:04:00.069> have<00:04:00.189> its<00:04:00.310> tactical<00:04:00.730> uses<00:04:01.090> but

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
could still have its tactical uses but

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.809 
could still have its tactical uses but
there's<00:04:01.689> a<00:04:01.750> lot<00:04:01.900> more<00:04:02.019> compact<00:04:02.500> than<00:04:05.819> the

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
there's a lot more compact than the

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:11.240 
there's a lot more compact than the
full-size<00:04:09.000> you've<00:04:10.000> still<00:04:10.209> got<00:04:10.420> your<00:04:10.450> strike

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250

striker<00:04:12.250> on<00:04:12.519> flint<00:04:12.819> rod<00:04:13.000> I<00:04:13.409> can<00:04:14.409> keep<00:04:14.620> separate

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:15.159 
striker on flint rod I can keep separate

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:20.969

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
use it Morris with full-length pin but

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.779 
use it Morris with full-length pin but
