me<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.360> kind<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.720> looks<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.409> little<00:01:22.820> scandalous

what<00:01:24.119> I'm<00:01:24.240> thinking<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.600> doing<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:25.080> getting

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
what I'm thinking of doing is getting

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.760 
what I'm thinking of doing is getting
some<00:01:26.070> double-sided<00:01:26.549> tape<00:01:27.049> just<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.470> I

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
some double-sided tape just so that I

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.940 
some double-sided tape just so that I
can<00:01:29.430> kind<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.670> close<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.060> up<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.299> little<00:01:30.479> bit<00:01:30.950> but

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
can kind of close it up a little bit but

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.260 
can kind of close it up a little bit but
if<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.430> are<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:33.229> smaller<00:01:34.310> chested<00:01:35.310> girl<00:01:35.369> I

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
if you are a smaller chested girl I

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.090 
if you are a smaller chested girl I
think<00:01:36.689> this<00:01:37.110> would<00:01:37.259> look<00:01:37.290> really<00:01:37.439> cute<00:01:37.890> I
