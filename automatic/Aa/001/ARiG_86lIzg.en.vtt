point<00:00:07.799> five<00:00:07.919> point<00:00:07.980> one<00:00:08.280> and<00:00:09.139> I've<00:00:10.139> been

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
point five point one and I've been

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.259 
point five point one and I've been
experimenting<00:00:10.860> with<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.670> new<00:00:11.910> redstone

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269

peaches<00:00:12.750> added<00:00:14.480> basically<00:00:15.480> this<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:17.690> it's

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
peaches added basically this is a it's

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.189 
peaches added basically this is a it's
it's<00:00:19.470> kind<00:00:19.920> of<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.070> tee<00:00:20.250> flip-flop<00:00:20.850> so<00:00:21.300> it'll

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
it's kind of a tee flip-flop so it'll

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.220 
it's kind of a tee flip-flop so it'll
toggle<00:00:22.529> I<00:00:23.029> call<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.060> memory<00:00:24.480> cell<00:00:24.689> because<00:00:25.080> you

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
toggle I call it memory cell because you

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.470 
toggle I call it memory cell because you
can<00:00:25.380> store<00:00:25.650> bytes<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:26.039> data<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.730> toggle<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:27.390> on

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
can store bytes of data and toggle it on

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.070 
can store bytes of data and toggle it on
and<00:00:27.689> off<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.880> these<00:00:29.880> are<00:00:29.939> good<00:00:30.240> in<00:00:30.570> many

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
and off and these are good in many

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.170 
and off and these are good in many
applications<00:00:31.260> if<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.730> look<00:00:32.850> at<00:00:32.969> my<00:00:33.090> other

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
applications if you look at my other

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.610 
applications if you look at my other
redstone<00:00:33.600> videos<00:00:33.930> i'll<00:00:34.110> use<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.410> chief

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
redstone videos i'll use the chief

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.299 
redstone videos i'll use the chief
flip-flop<00:00:35.070> but<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.000> thought<00:00:36.360> there'd<00:00:36.690> be<00:00:36.690> a

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
flip-flop but I thought there'd be a

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.479 
flip-flop but I thought there'd be a
much<00:00:38.309> more<00:00:38.489> compact<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.500> a<00:00:40.500> much<00:00:40.770> simpler<00:00:41.280> way

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
much more compact and a much simpler way

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.690 
much more compact and a much simpler way
to<00:00:41.520> make<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:42.000> with<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.899> new<00:00:43.309> redstone<00:00:44.309> blocks

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
to make it with the new redstone blocks

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.610 
to make it with the new redstone blocks
and<00:00:45.739> imperatives<00:00:47.930> now<00:00:48.930> over<00:00:49.260> here<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.410> my

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
and imperatives now over here is my

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.770 
and imperatives now over here is my
bigger<00:00:49.920> sore<00:00:50.309> test<00:00:50.610> version<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.329> it's<00:00:51.449> kind

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
bigger sore test version and it's kind

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.500 
bigger sore test version and it's kind
of<00:00:51.899> easy<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.410> explain<00:00:53.300> if<00:00:54.300> i<00:00:54.420> push<00:00:54.629> this<00:00:54.809> button

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
of easy to explain if i push this button

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.049 
of easy to explain if i push this button
that<00:00:57.510> block<00:00:57.750> will<00:00:57.960> toggle<00:00:58.140> oh<00:00:58.820> let<00:00:59.820> me<00:00:59.850> give<00:01:00.030> it

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
that block will toggle oh let me give it

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.890 
that block will toggle oh let me give it
a<00:01:00.210> sec

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.870 

there<00:01:04.900> we<00:01:05.170> go<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:08.500> it'll<00:01:08.740> toggle<00:01:08.980> the<00:01:09.370> output

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
there we go and it'll toggle the output

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.740 
there we go and it'll toggle the output
on<00:01:10.060> and<00:01:10.300> off<00:01:10.390> I<00:01:10.600> think<00:01:10.630> without<00:01:11.350> fail<00:01:12.390> it's<00:01:13.390> got

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
on and off I think without fail it's got

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.020 
on and off I think without fail it's got
to<00:01:13.840> be<00:01:13.930> without<00:01:14.170> fail<00:01:17.580> looks<00:01:18.580> to<00:01:18.790> me<00:01:18.820> without

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
to be without fail looks to me without

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.660 
to be without fail looks to me without
fail<00:01:19.710> now<00:01:20.710> this<00:01:20.920> is<00:01:21.100> where<00:01:21.250> I'm<00:01:21.370> having<00:01:21.580> the

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
fail now this is where I'm having the

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.130 
fail now this is where I'm having the
output<00:01:22.030> it<00:01:22.150> comes<00:01:22.360> through<00:01:22.570> the<00:01:22.660> middle<00:01:22.960> here

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
output it comes through the middle here

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:30.660 
output it comes through the middle here
and<00:01:25.320> let's<00:01:26.320> change<00:01:26.620> it<00:01:26.800> today<00:01:29.400> here<00:01:30.400> we<00:01:30.550> go

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
and let's change it today here we go

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.840 
and let's change it today here we go
here<00:01:30.910> we<00:01:30.940> go<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:32.320> we've<00:01:32.619> got<00:01:32.770> toggling<00:01:33.310> this<00:01:33.670> is

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
here we go so we've got toggling this is

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.180 
here we go so we've got toggling this is
the<00:01:34.000> upper<00:01:34.119> over<00:01:34.660> here<00:01:35.040> basically<00:01:36.040> what

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
the upper over here basically what

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.770 
the upper over here basically what
happens<00:01:36.490> is<00:01:36.700> in<00:01:37.000> in<00:01:37.780> this<00:01:38.710> state<00:01:39.780> powers

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
happens is in in this state powers

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.240 
happens is in in this state powers
coming<00:01:40.990> from<00:01:41.200> the<00:01:41.320> redstone<00:01:41.710> block<00:01:41.950> and<00:01:42.160> it's

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
coming from the redstone block and it's

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.270 
coming from the redstone block and it's
coming<00:01:42.520> over<00:01:42.700> here<00:01:42.880> and<00:01:43.149> it's<00:01:43.360> going<00:01:43.660> to<00:01:44.280> this

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
coming over here and it's going to this

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.300 
coming over here and it's going to this
comparator<00:01:45.970> so<00:01:46.869> saying<00:01:47.610> in<00:01:48.610> this<00:01:49.360> state<00:01:50.310> this

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
comparator so saying in this state this

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.880 
comparator so saying in this state this
piston<00:01:51.820> cannot<00:01:52.210> pushed<00:01:52.630> because<00:01:53.320> the<00:01:53.680> signal

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
piston cannot pushed because the signal

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.469 
piston cannot pushed because the signal
here<00:01:54.190> is<00:01:54.310> stronger<00:01:54.700> than<00:01:54.820> the<00:01:54.970> signal<00:01:55.330> back

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
here is stronger than the signal back

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.180 
here is stronger than the signal back
here<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:57.369> the<00:01:57.460> piston<00:01:57.850> can't<00:01:58.119> push<00:01:58.360> out<00:01:58.570> here

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
here so the piston can't push out here

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.880 
here so the piston can't push out here
but<00:02:00.190> it's<00:02:00.340> also<00:02:00.520> saying<00:02:00.910> because<00:02:01.119> there's<00:02:01.890> no

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
but it's also saying because there's no

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:09.800 
but it's also saying because there's no
power<00:02:03.369> into<00:02:03.820> their<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:07.479> piston<00:02:08.020> can<00:02:08.789> move

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
power into their that piston can move

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.570 
power into their that piston can move
which<00:02:10.810> means<00:02:11.080> if<00:02:11.290> power<00:02:11.530> is<00:02:11.740> applied<00:02:14.580> the

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
which means if power is applied the

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.360 
which means if power is applied the
piston<00:02:15.940> will<00:02:16.060> push<00:02:16.209> it<00:02:16.360> over<00:02:16.630> and<00:02:16.840> then<00:02:17.370> it

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
piston will push it over and then it

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.660 
piston will push it over and then it
just<00:02:18.640> swaps<00:02:19.030> around<00:02:19.420> so<00:02:19.780> that<00:02:19.810> means<00:02:20.459> this<00:02:21.459> way

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
just swaps around so that means this way

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.220 
just swaps around so that means this way
around<00:02:21.880> this<00:02:22.030> one<00:02:22.209> can't<00:02:22.510> go<00:02:22.690> because<00:02:22.959> it's

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
around this one can't go because it's

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.620 
around this one can't go because it's
powered<00:02:23.530> from<00:02:23.620> here<00:02:23.860> and<00:02:24.220> if<00:02:25.150> we<00:02:25.180> push<00:02:25.480> the

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
powered from here and if we push the

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.000 
powered from here and if we push the
thing<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:26.050> other<00:02:26.170> one<00:02:26.350> doesn't<00:02:26.560> have<00:02:26.770> power

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
thing the other one doesn't have power

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.300 
thing the other one doesn't have power
to<00:02:27.220> there<00:02:27.400> so<00:02:28.030> it<00:02:28.240> will<00:02:28.420> move<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:30.040> only<00:02:30.190> issue

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
to there so it will move the only issue

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.790 
to there so it will move the only issue
is<00:02:30.550> you<00:02:30.790> have<00:02:30.970> to<00:02:31.150> use<00:02:31.360> a<00:02:31.660> things<00:02:32.290> go<00:02:32.500> to<00:02:32.560> two

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
is you have to use a things go to two

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.330 
is you have to use a things go to two
poles<00:02:33.099> limiter<00:02:34.860> otherwise<00:02:35.860> what<00:02:36.190> you're

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
poles limiter otherwise what you're

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.180 
poles limiter otherwise what you're
going<00:02:36.459> to<00:02:36.520> have<00:02:36.700> is<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.810> if<00:02:38.170> i<00:02:38.349> get<00:02:38.740> rid<00:02:38.950> of<00:02:39.010> it

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
going to have is the if i get rid of it

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.690 
going to have is the if i get rid of it
I<00:02:39.400> just<00:02:39.730> power<00:02:40.060> it<00:02:40.300> like<00:02:40.569> here

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
I just power it like here

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.550 
I just power it like here
with<00:02:42.849> a<00:02:43.090> button<00:02:43.739> it'll<00:02:44.739> go<00:02:46.170> twice<00:02:47.170> sometimes

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
with a button it'll go twice sometimes

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.479 
with a button it'll go twice sometimes
because<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:49.660> changes<00:02:50.110> state<00:02:50.440> then<00:02:50.920> changes

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
because it changes state then changes

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.220 
because it changes state then changes
stay<00:02:51.730> again<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:52.420> other<00:02:52.569> way<00:02:52.660> to<00:02:52.720> solve<00:02:53.050> that

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
stay again the other way to solve that

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.690 
stay again the other way to solve that
would<00:02:53.440> be<00:02:53.650> too<00:02:54.010> I<00:02:55.650> think<00:02:56.650> I<00:02:56.890> didn't<00:02:57.400> think<00:02:57.519> of

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
would be too I think I didn't think of

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.960 
would be too I think I didn't think of
this<00:02:57.910> this<00:02:58.269> is<00:02:58.360> actually<00:02:58.750> a<00:02:58.780> good<00:02:58.900> idea<00:02:59.970> it

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
this this is actually a good idea it

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.050 
this this is actually a good idea it
would<00:03:01.090> make<00:03:01.239> the<00:03:01.390> sell<00:03:01.630> a<00:03:01.660> lot<00:03:02.200> slower<00:03:02.910> this<00:03:03.910> is

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
would make the sell a lot slower this is

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.759 
would make the sell a lot slower this is
the<00:03:04.209> only<00:03:04.330> issue<00:03:04.630> oh<00:03:07.170> no<00:03:08.170> it<00:03:08.260> doesn't<00:03:08.590> solve

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
the only issue oh no it doesn't solve

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:14.009 
the only issue oh no it doesn't solve
the<00:03:08.950> problem<00:03:11.190> yeah<00:03:12.190> I<00:03:12.690> personally<00:03:13.690> I<00:03:13.720> would

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
the problem yeah I personally I would

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.850 
the problem yeah I personally I would
use<00:03:14.230> a<00:03:14.260> two<00:03:14.799> balls<00:03:15.010> limiter<00:03:15.459> and<00:03:16.620> over<00:03:17.620> here<00:03:17.830> I

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
use a two balls limiter and over here I

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.140 
use a two balls limiter and over here I
just<00:03:18.280> made<00:03:18.610> it<00:03:18.640> a<00:03:18.849> lot<00:03:19.030> smaller<00:03:19.420> and<00:03:21.030> as<00:03:22.030> you

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
just made it a lot smaller and as you

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.819 
just made it a lot smaller and as you
see<00:03:22.390> it<00:03:22.540> does<00:03:22.750> work<00:03:23.079> in<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:23.860> same<00:03:24.099> way<00:03:24.160> and<00:03:25.829> we

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
see it does work in the same way and we

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.479 
see it does work in the same way and we
have<00:03:27.040> our<00:03:27.190> output<00:03:27.780> over<00:03:28.780> here<00:03:29.110> I<00:03:29.440> am<00:03:30.130> /<00:03:30.280> here

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
have our output over here I am / here

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.030 
have our output over here I am / here
and<00:03:30.730> we<00:03:31.540> could<00:03:31.720> make<00:03:31.870> it<00:03:32.019> smaller<00:03:32.319> still<00:03:32.709> but

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
and we could make it smaller still but

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.539 
and we could make it smaller still but
I'll<00:03:33.220> leave<00:03:33.489> that<00:03:33.549> to<00:03:33.819> you<00:03:34.030> guys<00:03:34.180> and<00:03:35.549> thank
