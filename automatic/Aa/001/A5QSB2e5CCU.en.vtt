00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:14.350
 here they are products that are still us 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.960
 contribute to weight loss, I like them 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.640
 grouped into several categories 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.680
 first of all it is natural e not 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.130
 man-processed products and 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.800
 preferably organic 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.769
 what organic are products 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.519
 grown without pesticides and 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:34.260
 herbicides 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:39.760
 without these hormones and other 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:42.940
 growth stimulants without gmo seeds that is 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.039
 what can bring 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.199
 really such a therapeutic benefit for 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:48.899
 of our body unfortunately in Russia 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:52.570
 once again I remind there is no culture 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.300
 organic farming organic can 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.469
 count only what grew on your 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.559
 own garden 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.280
 either you bought from a reputable proven 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.129
 you 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.750
 farmers who do not use what 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:10.330
 then there are ethical considerations 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:12.880
 All here are these supplements and pesticides products 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:17.790
 having a low glycemic load 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:22.290
 That is, these are products that are usually 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:25.390
 vegetables is a product and legumes 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.930
 which do not affect sharp fluctuations 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:32.350
 blood sugar because a sharp 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:36.130
 decrease in blood glucose is nothing 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:39.750
 other than hunger or appetite if there is more 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.750
 some other factors are present 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.070
 foods with high food 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:48.030
 density here are many such terms 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.950
 new possible for you but i will explain 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.520
 food density is food 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.240
 which on suppose calorie 100 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.130
 calories 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.630
 have plenty of good proteins 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.659
 healthy fats 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.450
 that is, polyunsaturated fats 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.869
 monounsaturated fats and carbohydrates 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.760
 that help us saturate it is not 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.820
 just simple some sugar and 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.440
 carbohydrates that contain fiber and 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.680
 also have 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:25.090
 you are high in micro nutrients 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:28.180
 vitamins minerals trace elements and 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:32.860
 4 high nutrient foods 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:37.180
 density is no secret to anyone 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:40.620
 many modern scientists are talking about 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.540
 that overeating is not only 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.870
 cause of psychological experiences about 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.480
 this attempt to get useful emotions 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.230
 or neutralize negative emotions 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.480
 it is also a shortage of its condition the pH 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.770
 if there is a chronic person 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.830
 missing in food 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:05.020
 vitamins minerals and trace elements then he 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:07.630
 begins to look for them and usually finds 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.940
 in empty products products that are not 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.990
 contain vitamins minerals 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:17.920
 a contains a lot of calories and 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:20.410
 are food drugs fifth 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.750
 item foods are raw and correct 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.660
 cooked here is also very important 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.720
 moment because it is boiled stewed 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:34.810
 products they are not the cause 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:37.750
 the formation of so-called products 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.000
 final glycolysis or products 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.870
 which are carcinogen for example 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.730
 if we fried something here 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.950
 black charred pieces this is neither 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.650
 what else is heterocyclic amines 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.380
 which are direct carcinogens 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.300
 that is, the way of cooking too 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.310
 very important and products right 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.640
 cooked help reduce 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.590
 weight that is boiled and stewed well and 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.790
 necessarily 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.650
 last on which we will finish this 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.660
 list of products that you 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.000
 use in attached limits 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:14.459
 calorie corridor 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:17.530
 I am familiar with several cases when 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:20.489
 even very respected by me experts 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.710
 functional medicine was losing the courts 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:26.770
 and for very serious amounts 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.870
 when they assigned people some even 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.000
 very correct food 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.310
 but they did not stipulate 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:39.280
 calorie consumption of these products 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:42.430
 and the same customers who ate 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:45.190
 for example fish and meat vegetables 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:48.760
 but the calorie exceeded the daily 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:51.700
 need for calories have high 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.680
 the risks of weight gain are just like if 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:57.280
 would they just eat some cakes 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.260
 surely weight gain rate here 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.990
 will be much lower than if just 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.340
 go for chocolate and cakes within 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.480
 three thousand kilocalories 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:10.000
 If the daily requirement 2200 but the 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.780
 no less weight gain can 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.690
 take place 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.690
 if you exceed calorie foods
