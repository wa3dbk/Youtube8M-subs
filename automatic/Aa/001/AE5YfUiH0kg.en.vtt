00:00:50.320 --> 00:01:02.400
 Well, nothing if we knew when doing 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.400
 what I would do would be a nice match 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:20.100
 how this is done I did not want to cut them 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:20.100

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.630
 known hair is lame and I stretch it 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.240

 Really 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.980
 not for nothing but because my nerves 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.670
 blocked and in fact that makes me not 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.200

 do very little time 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.350
 and then so I do not know how I do it 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.940
 very little time but also very little 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:38.430
