00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
all rifles not some machine guns because

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.670 
all rifles not some machine guns because
the<00:01:45.210> long-range<00:01:45.630> shots<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:45.960> very<00:01:46.140> efficient

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
the long-range shots is very efficient

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.710

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
if uses some machine guns go a lot of

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.030 
if uses some machine guns go a lot of
recoil<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.259> i<00:01:49.320> wouldn't<00:01:49.530> suggest<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.920> guys

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
recoil so i wouldn't suggest you guys

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.569 
recoil so i wouldn't suggest you guys
using<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:51.450> know<00:01:52.159> but<00:01:53.159> get<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.340> lot<00:01:53.549> of

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
was a sport nowadays I think this game

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.670 
was a sport nowadays I think this game
is<00:02:48.730> all<00:02:48.940> about<00:02:48.970> in<00:02:49.300> support<00:02:49.780> that's<00:02:50.410> just<00:02:50.560> the

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
is all about in support that's just the

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.310 
is all about in support that's just the
