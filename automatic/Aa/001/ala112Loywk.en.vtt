again<00:01:23.549> my<00:01:24.270> great<00:01:24.840> friend<00:01:25.229> tension<00:01:26.100> has<00:01:26.369> caused

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
again my great friend tension has caused

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.850 
again my great friend tension has caused
me<00:01:27.150> trouble<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.750> can<00:01:27.930> see<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.229> just<00:01:28.259> goes

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
me trouble and you can see it just goes

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.310 
me trouble and you can see it just goes
out<00:01:29.159> towards<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.670> end<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.540> reckon<00:01:30.960> on<00:01:31.140> this

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
out towards the end and I reckon on this

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.899 
out towards the end and I reckon on this
one<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.829> problem<00:01:32.159> was<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.310> because<00:01:32.610> you're

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
one the problem was that because you're

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.670 
one the problem was that because you're
knitting<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.630> purling<00:01:33.659> in<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.619> many

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
knitting and purling in so many

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.590 
knitting and purling in so many
different<00:01:34.860> patterns<00:01:35.250> if<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.939> pull<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.420> wool

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
different patterns if you pull the wool

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.539 
different patterns if you pull the wool
forward<00:01:37.200> or<00:01:37.350> backwards<00:01:37.920> behind<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.340> needle

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
forward or backwards behind the needle

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.310 
forward or backwards behind the needle
what<00:01:39.090> happens<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:40.110> just

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
what happens is is that it just

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.810 
what happens is is that it just
everything<00:01:40.560> gets<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.920> bit<00:01:41.070> slack<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.640> if<00:01:41.700> you

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
everything gets a bit slack so if you

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.760 
everything gets a bit slack so if you
just<00:01:42.030> make<00:01:42.270> sure<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.810> tension<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.500> the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
just make sure that the tension and the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.530 
just make sure that the tension and the
wool<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.070> wrapped<00:01:44.340> around<00:01:44.490> your<00:01:44.880> finger<00:01:45.270> to

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
wool is wrapped around your finger to

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.969 
wool is wrapped around your finger to
