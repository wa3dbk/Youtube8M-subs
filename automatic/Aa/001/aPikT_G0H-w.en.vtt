 that thermometer you saw the light there 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.510
 in the open market my name is allan the name 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.869
 of my grandfather leveraged in heartthrob cfa 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.090
 so you can see the right term one 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.160
 video explaining that they do not leave others 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.580
 relevant you happen to see this video 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.990
 do not trust others it demands is solid 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.910
 avaí in the series a 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.610
 you can see that as the theme was 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.370
 sent to you live in the box 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:42.450
 dollar each with a lexus by the post office 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.850
 Come to your house, they'll open what 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.510
 You will see the avaí seems to be 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.840
 huh 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.580
 Furthermore eike English manual that 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.380
 manual that comes with the 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.900
 Thermometer as Supplier 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.270
 the delivery will be that it is a product 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.790
 so badly imported English 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.920
 besides the manual in Portuguese that is 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.170
 a small one in operations just to show 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.210
 how will it be set up as you go? 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:12.990
 make recordings to make the measurement 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:14.700
 correct when leaving a note from there you 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.579
 it suits 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.579
 You can see here has the part of the 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:23.340
 the screen and the on / off button 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:24.749
 and up here the cane button that is the 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.100
 button, you're going to ask 

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:28.439
 make measurement 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.090
 We're getting underneath it. 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.789
 charges a battery 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.890
 you get that cap of you may 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.719
 the battery comes with a paper in the 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.939
 down to avoid contact with it is a 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:39.960
 unnecessary waste of energy during the 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.389
 transport 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.700
 So we have to get this one out. 

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:46.590
 here to turn on the thermometer of a 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.810
 Little delay here. 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.369
 holding the battery so that neither 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.479
 pull down to remove the battery 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.249
 the paper 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.579
 I'll pick up some scissors here to help and 

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:55.579
 that 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:07.479
 down here here take paper with the 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:09.399
 Battery leave across the battery 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:13.750
 a positive time you can see here 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.519
 a negative pole is the positive that I 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.860
 I have more inscription and turn to 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:21.040
 Up as she is here. 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.160
 the original box of it only put 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.930
 here at home easily to do this 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.670
 thermometer measurement we can have 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.700
 that before we choose to 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.140
 want to see in the ear forehead people talk 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.310
 if we take the power button and 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.720
 off and press and for five seconds 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.060
 When you do, it will weigh on the screen. 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:44.739
 option heard then here it catches me 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.780
 the soldier heard change this setting 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.220
 there was a drop in tension 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.500
 asked today 1st on earth 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.480
 so I selected the forehead for 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.360
 selecting the party is enough after 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.280
 heard or the thesis of 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.299
 pedro buttons field the team he 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:05.170
 exchange between ear in theory it seemed 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:07.590
 40 years old responds that he can already 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.329
 ask for what you want to take care of then 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.100
 he has to be with this device that 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:13.690
 It serves to the next whole 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.850
 The circumference of the 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.620
 against the forehead to ensure the 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.790
 As the temperature sensor exactly 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.260
 it's on the forehead 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.880
 so we put it like that for example 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.400
 beside 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.260
 is he going to make the wrong medication the 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.530
 important is that all this 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.930
 total cut surface on the forehead is 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.120
 a full contact and you press the 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.630
 to finish and he half a second does not 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.060
 I'll leave a ticket here. 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:50.139
 Telling what you measured you can see 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:51.300
 temperature here 36.4 required the 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:54.040
 video 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.660
 shaped dish sold on Tuesday in 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.440
 nou camp life we have to change the 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:03.940
 local then the money here call 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:06.430
 again did not appear until the 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.670
 scandal button as it covers the ear 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.110
 he keeps playing normally to 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.090
 make measurement doubt people withdraw 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:18.340
 separated because of its mission in 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:20.380
 the land then retired here and we 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.120
 sensor inside the ear canal so I 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.290
 I put the census in here. 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:29.680
 the brazilian game she helps to talk 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:33.130
 inside and open the button and ready 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:44.590
 can see the temperature here from 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:46.900
 new the same thing 36.4 equal again to 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.030
 people to observe for the two competitions 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:52.810
 presses with the time off button 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.820
 skank if open and offer the latest 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:59.669
 second and last measurement that in the 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:02.110
 here 36.4 and the last edition which also 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:06.100
 36.4 ie temperature in the earth of 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.300
 already has a system that converts 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.490
 the temperature is tense with 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.860
 body temperature because the 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:15.040
 temperature at the party it is lower is 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.750
 two degrees lower because it has much 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.490
 of all models are being sold 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.600
 is one of the only ones that really convinces 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.910
 this temperature 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.140
 we've even sold the mids here 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.180
 in the free market 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.610
 they measure the temperature on the forehead but 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.229
 they do not convert the text temperature 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.570
 the body temperature or 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:33.340
 temperature is lower and middle 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.479
 temperature and shape measured temperature 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:38.110
 especially those you do not need 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:40.030
 Contact same temperature in shape 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.229
 only in case the parameter you know it 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.669
 have a fever or are not 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:45.220
 whereas the measurement location to 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:47.890
 another and this has a lot of name 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.450
 date of the conversation party at the temperature 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.760
 was measured at the party for the temperature 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.140
 of the tube so the media that has 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.860
 to select only on 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.900
 heard 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.760
 already the temperature of the ear as you 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.770
 can see new ones in the free market 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.610
 She'll be everything, she 's what's in the body. 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:04.460
 which measures the similar temperature 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:07.099
 vander that the same was total of the circle 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:10.250
 controls body temperature 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:12.319
 is a very precise temperature and also 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.539
 will perform 

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:16.370
 So that 's it folks I ask any 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:18.409
 doubt any comment 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.270
 question that they have the deadline 

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:22.610
 thirty in the market can ask there 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.639
 and wait like you so much
