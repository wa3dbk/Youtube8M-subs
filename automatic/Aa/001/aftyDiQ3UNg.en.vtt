00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
there moves you can see that and the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.690 
there moves you can see that and the
reason<00:01:15.409> for<00:01:15.440> it<00:01:15.680> to<00:01:15.770> move<00:01:15.920> was<00:01:16.220> you<00:01:16.370> would<00:01:16.520> get

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
reason for it to move was you would get
