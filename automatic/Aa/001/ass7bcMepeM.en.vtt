00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
car the driver side seat belt which is

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.039 
car the driver side seat belt which is
kind<00:03:04.880> of<00:03:04.910> important<00:03:05.390> because<00:03:05.420> I'm<00:03:05.690> gonna<00:03:05.810> need

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
kind of important because I'm gonna need

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:12.819 
kind of important because I'm gonna need
that<00:03:06.230> fix<00:03:06.530> to<00:03:06.680> pass<00:03:06.860> inspection<00:03:11.650> anyway<00:03:12.650> but

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
that fix to pass inspection anyway but

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:14.680 
that fix to pass inspection anyway but
this<00:03:12.950> car<00:03:13.250> runs<00:03:13.730> really<00:03:14.060> well<00:03:14.209> runs

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
this car runs really well runs

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.770 
this car runs really well runs
interracially<00:03:15.260> well<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:16.070> best<00:03:16.310> part<00:03:16.630> is<00:03:17.630> it

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
interracially well the best part is it

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.100 
interracially well the best part is it
only<00:03:17.870> has<00:03:18.260> 95<00:03:19.130> thousand<00:03:19.850> original<00:03:20.510> miles

whoever<00:03:21.980> owned<00:03:22.130> this<00:03:22.310> car<00:03:22.549> obviously<00:03:23.120> it<00:03:23.180> was

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
whoever owned this car obviously it was

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.810 
whoever owned this car obviously it was
probably<00:03:23.690> kept<00:03:23.900> outside<00:03:24.380> but<00:03:24.820> not

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
probably kept outside but not

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.759 
probably kept outside but not
nevertheless<00:03:26.480> it<00:03:26.959> was<00:03:27.049> still<00:03:27.320> pretty<00:03:27.500> well

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
nevertheless it was still pretty well

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:36.120 
nevertheless it was still pretty well
maintained

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:43.020

throttle body fuel injection produces

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.780 
throttle body fuel injection produces
180<00:03:45.910> horsepower<00:03:46.360> and<00:03:47.610> 300<00:03:48.610> pounds<00:03:49.150> of<00:03:49.390> torque

180 horsepower and 300 pounds of torque

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.330 
180 horsepower and 300 pounds of torque
I'd<00:03:51.790> say<00:03:52.150> that<00:03:52.390> it<00:03:52.840> adequately<00:03:53.590> moves<00:03:54.100> this

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
I'd say that it adequately moves this

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.070 
I'd say that it adequately moves this
car<00:03:54.610> with<00:03:54.940> a<00:03:54.970> load<00:03:55.240> in<00:03:55.450> it<00:03:55.600> it's<00:03:55.840> definitely

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
car with a load in it it's definitely

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.830 
car with a load in it it's definitely

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
even without hitting the accelerator

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.060 
even without hitting the accelerator
definitely<00:04:07.690> glad<00:04:08.080> that<00:04:08.380> this<00:04:08.530> does<00:04:08.710> not<00:04:08.740> have

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
definitely glad that this does not have

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.150 
definitely glad that this does not have
the<00:04:09.220> 305<00:04:09.550> which<00:04:10.540> wall<00:04:11.110> only<00:04:11.380> 10<00:04:11.590> horsepower<00:04:12.040> or

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
the 305 which wall only 10 horsepower or

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.960 
the 305 which wall only 10 horsepower or
less<00:04:12.340> only<00:04:12.820> had<00:04:13.000> like<00:04:13.450> I<00:04:14.430> like<00:04:16.680> 255

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
less only had like I like 255

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.900 
less only had like I like 255
foot-pounds<00:04:18.970> of<00:04:19.030> torque<00:04:19.090> or<00:04:19.390> something<00:04:20.910> so

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
foot-pounds of torque or something so

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.270 
foot-pounds of torque or something so
that's<00:04:22.030> gotten<00:04:22.380> fairly<00:04:23.380> new<00:04:23.500> tires<00:04:23.800> I<00:04:24.100> said

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
that's gotten fairly new tires I said

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.370 
that's gotten fairly new tires I said
think<00:04:24.550> the<00:04:24.640> tires<00:04:24.820> have<00:04:25.060> about<00:04:25.210> 75%<00:04:25.840> tread

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
think the tires have about 75% tread

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.590 
think the tires have about 75% tread
left<00:04:26.620> on<00:04:26.860> them<00:04:27.010> but<00:04:27.730> the<00:04:27.880> original<00:04:28.030> Olson

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
left on them but the original Olson

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.770 
left on them but the original Olson
Beall<00:04:28.810> wheel<00:04:29.380> covers<00:04:29.860> I<00:04:30.390> guess<00:04:32.340> even<00:04:33.340> has<00:04:33.460> the

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
Beall wheel covers I guess even has the

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.510 
Beall wheel covers I guess even has the
original<00:04:34.780> keyless<00:04:35.680> entry<00:04:36.010> although<00:04:36.370> it's

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
original keyless entry although it's

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.270 
original keyless entry although it's
been<00:04:36.640> bypassed<00:04:37.150> with<00:04:38.020> a<00:04:38.050> aftermarket<00:04:38.980> setup

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
been bypassed with a aftermarket setup

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
been bypassed with a aftermarket setup
so<00:04:39.400> I<00:04:39.430> don't<00:04:39.580> know<00:04:39.640> I'm<00:04:40.270> so<00:04:40.450> long<00:04:40.630> it<00:04:40.840> I<00:04:42.300> guess

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
so I don't know I'm so long it I guess

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.090 
so I don't know I'm so long it I guess
whoever<00:04:43.450> bought<00:04:43.750> this<00:04:43.960> car<00:04:44.200> just<00:04:44.230> like<00:04:44.620> really

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
whoever bought this car just like really

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.980 
whoever bought this car just like really
did<00:04:45.430> not<00:04:45.550> like<00:04:45.760> alloy<00:04:46.120> wheels<00:04:46.450> because<00:04:46.750> it's

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
did not like alloy wheels because it's

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.450 
did not like alloy wheels because it's
pretty<00:04:47.200> much<00:04:47.350> the<00:04:47.530> only<00:04:47.590> thing<00:04:47.920> this<00:04:48.280> car

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
pretty much the only thing this car

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.360 
pretty much the only thing this car
doesn't<00:04:48.760> have<00:04:49.140> look<00:04:50.140> at<00:04:50.260> this<00:04:50.410> it's<00:04:51.340> even<00:04:51.640> got

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
doesn't have look at this it's even got

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.610 
doesn't have look at this it's even got
this<00:04:54.370> is<00:04:54.580> pretty<00:04:54.850> awesome<00:04:55.410> it's<00:04:56.410> got<00:04:56.590> a

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
this is pretty awesome it's got a

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.900 
this is pretty awesome it's got a

built-in digital compass in the mirror

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.850 
built-in digital compass in the mirror
which<00:05:01.750> I<00:05:01.960> didn't<00:05:02.200> even<00:05:02.320> know<00:05:02.530> existed<00:05:03.430> in<00:05:04.860> 1992

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
which I didn't even know existed in 1992

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.090 
which I didn't even know existed in 1992
but<00:05:06.370> there<00:05:06.880> it<00:05:06.970> is

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
but there it is

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.530 
but there it is
it's<00:05:09.100> got<00:05:09.250> the<00:05:09.430> older-style

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
it's got the older-style

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:16.600 
it's got the older-style

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
and Buick Roadmaster were both pretty

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:22.600 
and Buick Roadmaster were both pretty
similar

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
similar

they<00:05:23.569> had<00:05:23.720> this<00:05:23.840> Vista<00:05:24.259> roof<00:05:25.000> which<00:05:26.000> is<00:05:26.180> pretty

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:26.389 
they had this Vista roof which is pretty

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:28.659 
they had this Vista roof which is pretty
cool<00:05:26.629> it's<00:05:26.870> not<00:05:27.139> a<00:05:27.199> moveable<00:05:27.800> like<00:05:28.099> sunroof<00:05:28.550> or

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
anything but it's kind of neat I guess

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:35.830
