00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
it's crooked because I don't care I

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.369

could<00:00:45.059> have<00:00:45.149> even<00:00:45.270> followed<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.840> stripe<00:00:46.200> and

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
could have even followed that stripe and

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.810 
could have even followed that stripe and
I<00:00:46.500> didn't<00:00:47.120> anyway<00:00:48.710> the<00:00:49.710> whole<00:00:49.829> idea<00:00:50.190> here<00:00:50.550> was

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
I didn't anyway the whole idea here was

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.700 
I didn't anyway the whole idea here was
to<00:00:51.149> just<00:00:51.539> use<00:00:51.750> fabric<00:00:52.140> scrap<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.559> had<00:00:52.800> and

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
to just use fabric scrap that I had and

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.689 
to just use fabric scrap that I had and
you<00:00:55.710> know<00:00:55.739> not<00:00:56.520> use<00:00:56.730> those<00:00:56.969> pesky<00:00:57.510> zip<00:00:57.960> locks

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
you know not use those pesky zip locks

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:00.619 
you know not use those pesky zip locks
but<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.730> also<00:00:59.879> didn't<00:01:00.120> want<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.300> use<00:01:00.390> velcro

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
but I also didn't want to use velcro

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.260 
but I also didn't want to use velcro
because<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.230> was<00:01:01.410> lazy<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.489> requires<00:01:02.910> going

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
because I was lazy and it requires going

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.899 
because I was lazy and it requires going
to<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.449> store<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:03.989> didn't<00:01:04.199> want<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:05.220> so

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
to the store and I didn't want to and so

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.630 
to the store and I didn't want to and so
I<00:01:05.939> was<00:01:06.119> remembering<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.600> bags<00:01:06.869> from<00:01:07.439> the

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
I was remembering the bags from the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.450 
I was remembering the bags from the
1970s<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.500> that<00:01:10.500> were<00:01:10.590> plastic<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.280> they

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
1970s and that were plastic and they

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.039 
1970s and that were plastic and they
never<00:01:11.610> had<00:01:11.880> some<00:01:12.090> lock<00:01:12.299> they<00:01:12.510> just<00:01:12.750> had<00:01:12.930> that

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
never had some lock they just had that

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.850 
never had some lock they just had that
little<00:01:13.350> folded<00:01:14.540> thing<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:16.110> know<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.470> flat<00:01:16.650> B

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
little folded thing you know the flat B

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.950 
little folded thing you know the flat B
and<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.759> don't<00:01:17.970> remember<00:01:18.299> there<00:01:18.689> being<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.930> lot

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
and I don't remember there being a lot

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.230 
and I don't remember there being a lot
of<00:01:19.200> spilling<00:01:19.650> so<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.159> thought<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:21.030> would<00:01:21.210> make

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
of spilling so I thought that would make

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.609 
of spilling so I thought that would make
sense<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.780> that's<00:01:21.930> kind<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.170> how<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> lot<00:01:22.500> of

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
sense and that's kind of how a lot of

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.490 
sense and that's kind of how a lot of
duvets<00:01:22.939> are<00:01:23.939> done<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.509> actually<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:25.049> lot<00:01:25.380> of

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
duvets are done and actually a lot of

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.160 
duvets are done and actually a lot of
pillows<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:26.250> I'm<00:01:27.210> sure<00:01:27.450> there's<00:01:27.659> tutorials

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
pillows so I'm sure there's tutorials

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.749 
pillows so I'm sure there's tutorials
for<00:01:28.290> this<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:29.210> didn't<00:01:30.210> even<00:01:30.329> look<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:31.350> I'm<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.549> did

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
for this I didn't even look so I'm I did

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.660 
for this I didn't even look so I'm I did
not<00:01:32.880> invent<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.420> but<00:01:34.250> and<00:01:35.250> there's<00:01:35.490> probably

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
not invent this but and there's probably

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.520 
not invent this but and there's probably
a<00:01:35.909> lot<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.180> info<00:01:36.450> but<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.930> just<00:01:37.259> thought<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.470> would

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
a lot of info but I just thought I would

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.640 
a lot of info but I just thought I would
film<00:01:37.860> what<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.100> had<00:01:38.640> been<00:01:39.150> doing<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.450> last<00:01:39.650> 20

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
film what I had been doing the last 20

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.850 
film what I had been doing the last 20
minutes<00:01:40.680> here<00:01:41.180> so<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.450> just<00:01:43.020> cut<00:01:43.229> some<00:01:43.259> fabric

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
minutes here so I just cut some fabric

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.280 
minutes here so I just cut some fabric
scrap<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.970> seems<00:01:45.600> like<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.810> would<00:01:45.869> work<00:01:46.079> and

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
scrap that seems like it would work and

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.760 
scrap that seems like it would work and
this<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.500> approximately<00:01:47.299> 17<00:01:48.299> inches<00:01:48.810> long<00:01:49.170> you

and<00:02:14.069> I<00:02:14.520> guess<00:02:14.849> you<00:02:14.970> could<00:02:15.090> make<00:02:15.270> up<00:02:15.390> for<00:02:15.420> that

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
and I guess you could make up for that

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.660 
and I guess you could make up for that
in<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:16.020> length<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:16.650> could<00:02:16.770> add<00:02:16.890> extra<00:02:17.220> length

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
in the length you could add extra length

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.620 
in the length you could add extra length
and<00:02:17.819> then<00:02:18.420> what<00:02:18.630> you<00:02:18.810> do<00:02:18.959> this<00:02:19.440> is<00:02:19.650> sort<00:02:19.890> of<00:02:19.950> the

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
and then what you do this is sort of the

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.339 
and then what you do this is sort of the
freak<00:02:21.630> out<00:02:23.090> what's<00:02:24.090> going<00:02:24.420> on<00:02:24.510> with<00:02:24.720> my<00:02:24.900> mind<00:02:25.110> I

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
freak out what's going on with my mind I

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.620 
freak out what's going on with my mind I
can't<00:02:25.620> figure<00:02:25.860> this<00:02:26.040> out<00:02:26.220> part<00:02:26.870> is<00:02:27.870> you<00:02:28.410> fold

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
more confusing than it needs to be then

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.960

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
just do a seam here goink

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.110 
just do a seam here goink
and<00:03:15.209> do<00:03:15.930> a<00:03:15.959> seam<00:03:16.319> here<00:03:16.739> goink<00:03:17.280> go<00:03:17.640> through<00:03:17.910> all

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
and do a seam here goink go through all

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.410 
and do a seam here goink go through all
the<00:03:18.480> layers<00:03:19.220> but<00:03:20.220> don't<00:03:20.459> think<00:03:21.950> then<00:03:23.209> you<00:03:24.209> end

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
the layers but don't think then you end

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.240 
the layers but don't think then you end
up<00:03:24.720> when<00:03:25.049> you<00:03:25.140> turn<00:03:25.380> it<00:03:25.470> inside<00:03:25.799> out<00:03:25.829> with

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
up when you turn it inside out with

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.509 
up when you turn it inside out with
something<00:03:26.579> like<00:03:26.700> this<00:03:26.940> and<00:03:28.040> you're<00:03:29.040> thinking

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
something like this and you're thinking

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.020 
something like this and you're thinking
my<00:03:30.269> flap<00:03:30.890> but<00:03:31.890> what<00:03:32.010> you<00:03:32.130> do<00:03:32.310> is<00:03:32.340> you<00:03:32.609> just<00:03:32.640> turn

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
my flap but what you do is you just turn

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.830 
my flap but what you do is you just turn
it<00:03:33.060> inside<00:03:33.480> out<00:03:35.510> see<00:03:36.510> and<00:03:36.840> then<00:03:38.329> your<00:03:39.329> flap<00:03:39.630> is

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
it inside out see and then your flap is

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.099 
it inside out see and then your flap is
still<00:03:40.200> gone<00:03:40.579> right<00:03:41.579> your<00:03:41.730> flap<00:03:41.970> go<00:03:42.269> and<00:03:42.870> it's

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
still gone right your flap go and it's

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.080 
still gone right your flap go and it's
maybe<00:03:43.470> a<00:03:43.590> little<00:03:43.650> stressful<00:03:44.160> but<00:03:44.670> don't<00:03:44.940> be

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
maybe a little stressful but don't be

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.990 
maybe a little stressful but don't be
stressed<00:03:45.359> because<00:03:46.250> your<00:03:47.250> flap<00:03:47.489> is<00:03:47.670> right<00:03:47.850> back

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
stressed because your flap is right back

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.970 
stressed because your flap is right back
here

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
here

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:55.699 
here
so<00:03:49.980> again<00:03:50.549> stacks<00:03:51.480> and<00:03:52.519> then<00:03:53.519> your<00:03:53.700> flap<00:03:54.709> goes

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
so again stacks and then your flap goes

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.530 
so again stacks and then your flap goes
like<00:03:55.889> this

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.240

seams<00:04:18.830> here<00:04:19.100> I<00:04:19.130> would<00:04:19.370> just<00:04:19.400> do<00:04:19.700> a<00:04:19.730> straight

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
seams here I would just do a straight

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.960 
seams here I would just do a straight
stitch<00:04:20.300> and<00:04:20.630> then<00:04:21.620> use<00:04:21.800> pinking<00:04:22.280> shears<00:04:22.340> if

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
stitch and then use pinking shears if

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.970 
stitch and then use pinking shears if
you<00:04:23.090> want<00:04:23.360> or<00:04:23.660> not<00:04:23.900> cuz<00:04:24.440> really<00:04:24.620> it's<00:04:24.860> the

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
you want or not cuz really it's the

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.220 
you want or not cuz really it's the
inside<00:04:25.280> of<00:04:25.370> a<00:04:25.430> stack<00:04:25.670> bag<00:04:25.910> so<00:04:26.390> I<00:04:26.660> don't<00:04:26.840> think

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
inside of a stack bag so I don't think

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.780
