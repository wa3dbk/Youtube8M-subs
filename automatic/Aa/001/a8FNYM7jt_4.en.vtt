00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.270
 or the one of the leaks as they are 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.310
 ochoa and today I bring you one 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.520
 basic guide of a super phil jones 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:25.240
 patrice nothing more and nothing less says 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.730
 that this is one of the hardest tanks 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.939
 of the game and very easy to use for 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.470
 who are beginning to play gifted as well 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.260
 that today we are going to learn more 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.620
 about their skills and how to arm this 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.620
 talde 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.260
 well next we will show the two 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.520
 kits that presents our press the bread 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.100
 the first is viscosity in the country 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.110
 cover the target with a viscosity 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.930
 causing him to lose armor and speed 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.089
 of multiple movement the release is 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.089
 accumulates and restarts the duration 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.250
 and the second mentioned is rain of 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.340
 thorns receives the enemy units 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.490
 with thorns inflicting damage to an area 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.500
 Around our hero inflicts damage 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.470
 additional for each time a unit 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.450
 has been sprayed by rain of thorns 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.450
 in the last 2 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.810
 well the piece of rotate mention is 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:37.780
 back hawthorn breeze part receives less 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.570
 damage if they attack it by the side whose 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.780
 Harm reduction is 20 percent or 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:47.470
 behind whose damage reduction is 40 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:50.470
 percent if our hero receives 250 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:54.120
 of damage from behind throws a rain of 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.120
 thorns of the current level 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:04.440
 the last ski the mention is cdr 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.960
 freezer goes between a state of fury every 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.510
 time he casts a spell increasing his 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.210
 movement speed and damage the 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:15.260
 first accumulation provides a 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.260
 Major bonus 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.409
 i 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.780
 below the museum how are we going to 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:34.090
 study in our today and before that 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.579
 nothing to remember that this hero is very 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.189
 good going alone online and do all 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:42.099
 stories today in some cases in same 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:44.769
 so according to the aforementioned we are going 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:47.950
 to show them how it would look like this 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:50.230
 team the first point we will give to the 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.390
 back thorny since from the beginning 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.299
 it would be good if we could resist 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.750
 some blows then you should another point 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:01.450
 to your rain of thorns eye here where you 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.849
 you're going to focus on climbing this elusive 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.829
 that with the help of this will help you as and 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:08.620
 I mentioned to kill very very quickly 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:11.530
 enemy then will try to climb 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.049
 in parallel the two skins that are 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.720
 back spinoza and rain of thorns 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:19.120
 until you reach level 6 and get the 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.790
 point power for your passive clip that 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.769
 it will come from war now they will be 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.470
 asking why not unblock the 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.599
 nasal viscosity that's because at the beginning 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.290
 of the game I'm going to focus sick to the 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:33.670
 understand how the enemy is behind or in 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.010
 Any case could jump 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.780
 a point of it for viscosity 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.780
 Nasal that depends on you 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:45.470
 next we will explain how 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:48.580
 we must arm our prince 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:52.640
 as a first phase we would go out with tangos 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:55.400
 a robust shield and we would form up 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.030
 complete your bacillus and wand 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.030
 Harry Potter 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.440
 and as a second force your 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:09.220
 drop in some cases I have opted for 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.100
 take off the boots of power or faith and 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.580
 depending on the situation 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:18.100
 he would also complete his water and already with 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.170
 this and you would have a resistance 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.950
 remarkable to enter the first 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.950
 infants 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.310
 and to finish in the third phase 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:33.860
 could accept for greater resistance 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:37.670
 to take off the track then a play mail 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:40.080
 and finally a shell and jumps 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.910
 remember that depending on the heroes 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.520
 or enemies 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:46.230
 you can also alternate your hub and me in 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.030
 an opportunity I had to see myself in the 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.300
 need for example to be able to take out 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:54.390
 direct orchis since well three magicians 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:58.050
 that were very very very annoying and I had to 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:05:01.540
 disable for it as I reiterate is 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.250
 depending how the game is going 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.640
 good guys I hope you liked it 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:09.370
 this basic guide of our gym phase 3 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:12.460
 and remember that if you are starting to 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:16.360
 play gifted this ere would be a very very 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:18.040
 good option and for a world if you do not 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.140

 two 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.800
 I 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.840
 yes 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.960
