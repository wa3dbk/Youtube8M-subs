00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:13.650

 looks pumpkin in itself unpretentious 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.960
 nothing in general requires we must 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.620
 we will base it with a diamond ax in 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:00.000
 general department I am an ax and a hoe 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.550
 and a friend, now I will tell someone Volodya bears 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.189
 more precisely took how took onions to use 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.470
 Well, I do not know at all we collect this peace 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.850
 I had to get out of special treatment 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.830
 the mode is called creative plus me just 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.680
 put me writing guides not 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.750
 watched in general what resources are running out 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.490
 Okay, we collect with an ax and I 'll go over this 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.460
 here's a pumpkin and we can or put ourselves on 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.680
 head here so here we look like this 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.140
 Here's a beautiful gorgeous look for her and 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.299
 the good thing is that in response we donâ€™t 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.880
 see enderman and this is also very good 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.790
 let's take the pumpkin off and how are we 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.860
 to grow, we have three types of one pumpkin 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.079
 we recycle all your time 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.500
 we get four families and to plant 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.270
 this is the seed we need to plow by again 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.899
 lands for us to grow pumpkin for us 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.979
 need a space of water 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.799
 plow and put 7 and 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.860
 and wait for some time until the seed is ripe 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.990
 The first stage was in tact and 2 puts 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.969
 also past in general everything is now 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.670
 wait until we grow a pumpkin and in 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.280
 in general, we will rejoice at our such here 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.810
 so fast everything grows like watermelons in general 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.060
 here and so looks flowed with us already 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.400
 grown further we can so as to collect 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.630
 and plant but if you don't want to pass 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.180
