in<00:01:11.459> a<00:01:11.999> sifter<00:01:12.509> if<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:13.380> happen<00:01:13.829> to<00:01:13.859> have<00:01:14.159> one<00:01:15.149> of

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
in a sifter if you happen to have one of

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.109 
in a sifter if you happen to have one of
those<00:01:15.389> decorator<00:01:16.200> icing<00:01:16.799> sugar<00:01:17.249> shakers<00:01:17.880> I

those decorator icing sugar shakers I

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.539 
those decorator icing sugar shakers I
would<00:01:18.659> use<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:18.899> but<00:01:19.649> I'm<00:01:19.770> not<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.219> lucky

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
would use that but I'm not that lucky

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.209 
would use that but I'm not that lucky
and<00:01:20.969> so<00:01:21.509> I'm<00:01:21.630> having<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:22.079> make<00:01:22.259> do<00:01:22.560> if<00:01:22.920> you

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:23.219 
and so I'm having to make do if you

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:25.010 
and so I'm having to make do if you
don't<00:01:23.429> have<00:01:23.609> a<00:01:23.639> sifter<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.630> could<00:01:24.840> use<00:01:24.990> a

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
don't have a sifter you could use a

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.660 
don't have a sifter you could use a
spoon<00:01:25.490> okay

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
spoon okay

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.219 
spoon okay
so<00:01:26.819> the<00:01:26.939> first<00:01:27.179> step<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.779> to<00:01:27.899> turn<00:01:28.049> your

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229

to be careful not to get the crumbs and
whatnot<00:02:06.779> into<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:07.849> so<00:02:08.849> I'm<00:02:09.000> not<00:02:09.179> going<00:02:09.509> right

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
whatnot into it so I'm not going right

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.330 
whatnot into it so I'm not going right
to<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:09.929> edge<00:02:10.140> because<00:02:10.830> I<00:02:10.890> want<00:02:11.040> to<00:02:11.130> make<00:02:11.310> sure

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
to the edge because I want to make sure

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.700 
to the edge because I want to make sure
that<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:13.430> top<00:02:14.430> of<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.670> cupcake

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
that the top of the cupcake

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.590 
that the top of the cupcake
all<00:02:16.100> of<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.310> pink<00:02:16.580> so<00:02:16.760> you<00:02:16.850> can't<00:02:17.090> see<00:02:17.330> any<00:02:17.480> of

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
all of the pink so you can't see any of

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.720 
all of the pink so you can't see any of
that<00:02:17.810> so<00:02:18.710> just<00:02:18.920> set<00:02:19.070> that<00:02:19.250> off<00:02:19.430> to<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.640> side

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
that so just set that off to the side

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.960 
that so just set that off to the side
and<00:02:20.180> then<00:02:20.810> with<00:02:21.020> your<00:02:21.200> cupcake<00:02:21.650> top<00:02:22.340> you're

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
and then with your cupcake top you're

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.450 
and then with your cupcake top you're
going<00:02:23.120> to<00:02:23.240> use<00:02:23.570> your<00:02:23.840> heart<00:02:24.110> cutter<00:02:24.410> I'm<00:02:25.280> just

going to use your heart cutter I'm just

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.430 
going to use your heart cutter I'm just
going<00:02:25.640> to<00:02:25.700> press<00:02:25.970> down<00:02:26.000> I<00:02:26.630> find<00:02:27.050> the<00:02:27.140> metal

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
going to press down I find the metal

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.940 
going to press down I find the metal
works<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.860> best<00:02:28.840> just<00:02:29.840> press<00:02:30.200> down<00:02:30.470> and<00:02:30.770> now

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
works the best just press down and now

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.340 
works the best just press down and now
at<00:02:31.190> this<00:02:31.400> point<00:02:31.730> I've<00:02:32.450> tried<00:02:32.810> it<00:02:32.960> a<00:02:32.990> couple<00:02:33.230> of

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
at this point I've tried it a couple of

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.230 
at this point I've tried it a couple of
ways<00:02:33.560> what<00:02:33.860> I<00:02:33.890> found<00:02:34.160> is<00:02:34.370> most<00:02:34.490> successful<00:02:34.730> as

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
ways what I found is most successful as

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.120 
ways what I found is most successful as
you<00:02:35.420> pull<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:35.780> whole<00:02:36.110> thing<00:02:36.350> up<00:02:36.530> it's

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
you pull the whole thing up it's

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.830 
you pull the whole thing up it's
sticking<00:02:37.520> to<00:02:37.700> there<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.180> just<00:02:38.360> poke<00:02:38.630> your

sticking to there and just poke your
heart<00:02:39.200> through<00:02:40.060> then<00:02:41.060> you've<00:02:41.990> got<00:02:42.260> your<00:02:42.500> top

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
heart through then you've got your top

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
to cut the top off again trim this one

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.539 
to cut the top off again trim this one
up<00:04:18.230> just<00:04:18.530> at<00:04:18.710> the<00:04:18.830> base<00:04:19.010> because<00:04:19.340> I'm<00:04:19.460> not

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
up just at the base because I'm not

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.420 
up just at the base because I'm not
going<00:04:19.790> to<00:04:19.850> use<00:04:20.030> the<00:04:20.210> top<00:04:20.420> and<00:04:21.230> now<00:04:21.680> I<00:04:21.710> found<00:04:22.040> a

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
going to use the top and now I found a

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.490 
going to use the top and now I found a
second<00:04:23.000> way<00:04:23.090> to<00:04:23.150> do<00:04:23.390> it<00:04:23.540> rather<00:04:23.930> than<00:04:24.080> use<00:04:24.350> your

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
second way to do it rather than use your

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.650 
second way to do it rather than use your
spatula<00:04:24.680> is<00:04:25.220> you<00:04:25.610> could<00:04:25.790> just<00:04:25.820> use<00:04:26.120> your<00:04:26.270> icing

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
spatula is you could just use your icing

spatula is you could just use your icing
