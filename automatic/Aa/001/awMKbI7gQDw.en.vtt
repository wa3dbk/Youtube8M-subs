yellow<00:00:41.570> but<00:00:42.050> now<00:00:42.199> I<00:00:42.230> think<00:00:42.379> he's<00:00:42.680> up<00:00:42.800> against<00:00:43.129> a

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
yellow but now I think he's up against a

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.540 
yellow but now I think he's up against a
much<00:00:43.399> stronger<00:00:43.910> roadblock<00:00:44.690> and<00:00:44.930> 0<00:00:45.680> who's<00:00:46.190> vs

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
much stronger roadblock and 0 who's vs

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.610 
much stronger roadblock and 0 who's vs
protoss<00:00:46.879> is<00:00:47.120> absolutely<00:00:47.720> well<00:00:48.379> not

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
protoss is absolutely well not

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.040 
protoss is absolutely well not
absolutely<00:00:49.370> immaculate<00:00:49.850> he<00:00:50.420> lost<00:00:50.659> against

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
absolutely immaculate he lost against

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.530 
absolutely immaculate he lost against
pure<00:00:51.350> couple<00:00:52.159> days<00:00:52.370> ago<00:00:52.400> and<00:00:53.000> I<00:00:53.030> think<00:00:53.269> that<00:00:53.420> is

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
pure couple days ago and I think that is

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.680 
pure couple days ago and I think that is
an<00:00:53.659> important<00:00:54.079> part<00:00:54.260> of<00:00:54.320> this<00:00:54.409> match<00:00:54.620> as<00:00:54.829> well

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
an important part of this match as well

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.149 
an important part of this match as well
but<00:00:56.690> I<00:00:56.750> think<00:00:57.079> this<00:00:57.199> would<00:00:57.350> be<00:00:57.379> a<00:00:57.500> very<00:00:57.949> good

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:58.159 
but I think this would be a very good

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:01.990 
but I think this would be a very good
match<00:00:58.699> pure<00:00:59.120> showing<00:00:59.570> strong<00:01:00.399> vs<00:01:01.399> zerg<00:01:01.610> play

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
coming up from pure this is on eye of

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.440

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
the storm by the wave and okay pure the

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.369 
the storm by the wave and okay pure the
last<00:02:17.660> game<00:02:17.959> I<00:02:18.290> remember<00:02:19.209> was<00:02:20.209> well<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.290> last

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
last game I remember was well the last

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.140 
last game I remember was well the last
game<00:02:21.620> he<00:02:21.770> played<00:02:21.800> on<00:02:22.190> I<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.520> storm<00:02:22.940> was

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
game he played on I the storm was

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.180 
game he played on I the storm was
against<00:02:23.450> yellow<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:23.959> the<00:02:24.379> OSL<00:02:24.770> and<00:02:24.890> he<00:02:24.950> lost

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
against yellow and the OSL and he lost

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.190 
against yellow and the OSL and he lost
so<00:02:26.030> he's<00:02:26.300> gonna<00:02:26.420> have<00:02:26.510> to<00:02:26.599> be<00:02:26.750> a<00:02:26.780> little<00:02:27.050> bit

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
so he's gonna have to be a little bit

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.020 
so he's gonna have to be a little bit
more<00:02:27.349> mindful<00:02:27.830> of<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:28.099> mute<00:02:28.340> Allah<00:02:28.520> strategy

lower<00:04:36.290> main<00:04:36.740> the<00:04:37.010> lower<00:04:37.190> left<00:04:37.490> main<00:04:38.980> okay<00:04:39.980> pure

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
lower main the lower left main okay pure

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:42.730 
lower main the lower left main okay pure
is<00:04:40.880> running<00:04:41.150> around<00:04:41.419> with<00:04:41.810> this<00:04:41.930> probe<00:04:42.260> still

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
is running around with this probe still

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.440 
is running around with this probe still
going<00:04:42.950> to<00:04:43.040> try<00:04:43.160> to<00:04:43.220> go<00:04:43.370> up<00:04:43.400> scout<00:04:44.210> what's

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
going to try to go up scout what's

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:45.700 
going to try to go up scout what's
happening<00:04:44.840> he's<00:04:44.990> going<00:04:45.110> to<00:04:45.169> run<00:04:45.350> into<00:04:45.440> some

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
happening he's going to run into some

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.170 
happening he's going to run into some
circlings<00:04:46.130> but<00:04:46.370> I<00:04:46.400> think<00:04:46.640> he'll<00:04:46.790> be<00:04:46.820> able<00:04:47.030> to

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
circlings but I think he'll be able to

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.930 
circlings but I think he'll be able to
do<00:04:47.450> it<00:04:47.480> Nexus<00:04:48.410> will<00:04:48.590> be<00:04:48.770> a<00:04:48.800> very<00:04:49.280> soon<00:04:49.700> so<00:04:49.730> it's

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
do it Nexus will be a very soon so it's

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.210 
do it Nexus will be a very soon so it's
going<00:04:50.060> to<00:04:50.150> get<00:04:50.240> that<00:04:50.390> rolling<00:04:50.810> it<00:04:51.590> is<00:04:51.680> economic

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
going to get that rolling it is economic

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.860 
going to get that rolling it is economic
advantage<00:04:53.090> going

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
advantage going

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.530 
advantage going
in0<00:04:56.010> yeah<00:04:57.010> I<00:04:57.040> think<00:04:57.160> that<00:04:57.430> this<00:04:57.790> game<00:04:58.120> against

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
in0 yeah I think that this game against

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.070 
in0 yeah I think that this game against
pure<00:04:58.960> he<00:04:59.650> kind<00:05:00.280> of<00:05:00.430> let<00:05:00.700> his<00:05:01.000> tech<00:05:01.360> get<00:05:01.840> away

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
pure he kind of let his tech get away

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.290 
pure he kind of let his tech get away
from<00:05:02.140> him<00:05:02.470> II<00:05:02.530> didn't<00:05:03.250> really<00:05:03.610> make<00:05:04.000> the<00:05:04.150> right

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
from him II didn't really make the right

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.480 
from him II didn't really make the right
decision<00:05:04.720> as<00:05:04.870> to<00:05:04.900> when<00:05:05.380> detect<00:05:05.770> when<00:05:06.310> to

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
decision as to when detect when to

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.280 
decision as to when detect when to
expand<00:05:06.880> because<00:05:07.060> really<00:05:07.390> he<00:05:07.570> expanded<00:05:08.110> and

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
expand because really he expanded and

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.590 
expand because really he expanded and
tect<00:05:08.560> at<00:05:08.710> the<00:05:08.800> exact<00:05:09.160> same<00:05:09.400> time<00:05:09.700> which<00:05:10.300> left

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
tect at the exact same time which left

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.530 
tect at the exact same time which left
way<00:05:10.870> too<00:05:10.900> few<00:05:11.680> troops<00:05:11.950> out<00:05:12.220> for<00:05:12.880> the<00:05:13.090> strategy

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:13.540 
way too few troops out for the strategy

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.090 
way too few troops out for the strategy
that<00:05:13.570> pure<00:05:13.900> was<00:05:14.050> committing<00:05:14.350> himself<00:05:14.440> to<00:05:14.770> a

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
that pure was committing himself to a

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.760 
that pure was committing himself to a
three<00:05:15.700> based<00:05:15.940> strategy<00:05:16.560> basically<00:05:17.560> one

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
three based strategy basically one

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.890 
three based strategy basically one
mining<00:05:18.130> base<00:05:18.310> at<00:05:18.580> the<00:05:18.700> end<00:05:18.940> where<00:05:19.270> sit<00:05:19.600> all<00:05:19.780> of

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
mining base at the end where sit all of

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.970 
mining base at the end where sit all of
his<00:05:20.020> probes<00:05:20.940> but<00:05:21.940> yeah<00:05:22.120> I<00:05:22.810> think<00:05:23.110> purebred

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:23.980 
his probes but yeah I think purebred

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.910 
his probes but yeah I think purebred
zero<00:05:24.400> like<00:05:24.640> a<00:05:24.670> book<00:05:25.000> and<00:05:25.320> kept<00:05:26.320> going<00:05:26.440> with

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:26.920 
zero like a book and kept going with

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.860 
zero like a book and kept going with
that<00:05:27.130> strategy<00:05:27.430> just<00:05:27.850> kept<00:05:28.270> putting<00:05:28.570> on<00:05:28.780> the

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
that strategy just kept putting on the

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.750 
that strategy just kept putting on the
pressure<00:05:28.960> and<00:05:29.350> eventually<00:05:29.710> broke<00:05:29.920> broke

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
pressure and eventually broke broke

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.000 
pressure and eventually broke broke
through<00:05:31.060> the<00:05:31.090> natural<00:05:31.740> okay<00:05:32.740> here<00:05:32.890> we<00:05:32.980> go

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
through the natural okay here we go

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:34.890 
through the natural okay here we go
probe<00:05:33.520> still<00:05:33.760> in<00:05:33.910> here<00:05:34.150> so<00:05:34.480> the<00:05:34.570> probe<00:05:34.780> is

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
probe still in here so the probe is

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.690 
probe still in here so the probe is
going<00:05:35.140> to<00:05:35.230> get<00:05:35.290> the<00:05:35.380> scout<00:05:35.590> on<00:05:35.770> the<00:05:36.580> next

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700 
going to get the scout on the next

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.340 
going to get the scout on the next
building<00:05:36.940> that<00:05:37.180> comes<00:05:37.330> up<00:05:37.510> he's<00:05:38.110> going<00:05:38.260> to

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:38.350 
building that comes up he's going to

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.010 
building that comes up he's going to
follow<00:05:38.860> this<00:05:39.130> drone<00:05:39.580> out<00:05:39.970> and<00:05:40.660> I<00:05:40.690> think<00:05:40.780> that

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
follow this drone out and I think that

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.050 
follow this drone out and I think that
drone<00:05:41.620> is<00:05:42.010> going<00:05:42.220> to<00:05:42.310> go<00:05:42.400> down<00:05:42.430> and<00:05:42.610> try<00:05:43.030> to

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
drone is going to go down and try to

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.960 
drone is going to go down and try to
take<00:05:43.390> the<00:05:43.720> eight<00:05:44.170> o'clock<00:05:44.470> main<00:05:44.950> because<00:05:45.850> that

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
take the eight o'clock main because that

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.730 
take the eight o'clock main because that
drones<00:05:46.210> going<00:05:46.540> out<00:05:46.690> could<00:05:47.110> be<00:05:47.230> that<00:05:47.260> or<00:05:47.620> a

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
drones going out could be that or a

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.680 
drones going out could be that or a
scout<00:05:48.160> but<00:05:48.370> I<00:05:48.430> think<00:05:48.610> it's<00:05:48.700> more<00:05:48.880> likely<00:05:48.910> to

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
scout but I think it's more likely to

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.860 
scout but I think it's more likely to
take<00:05:49.840> the<00:05:49.990> main<00:05:50.170> area<00:05:50.440> down<00:05:50.770> there<00:05:50.940> and<00:05:51.940> pure

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
take the main area down there and pure

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.870 
take the main area down there and pure
was<00:05:53.020> trying<00:05:53.260> to<00:05:53.410> micro<00:05:53.920> and<00:05:54.160> kill<00:05:54.460> that<00:05:54.700> one

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
was trying to micro and kill that one

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.250 
was trying to micro and kill that one
circling<00:05:55.360> in<00:05:55.450> the<00:05:55.480> back<00:05:55.690> but<00:05:55.900> he<00:05:55.960> got<00:05:56.080> it<00:05:56.170> down

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260 
circling in the back but he got it down

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.850 
circling in the back but he got it down
the<00:05:56.410> red<00:05:56.590> but<00:05:57.250> it's<00:05:57.520> not<00:05:57.790> dead<00:05:58.170> so<00:05:59.170> yeah<00:05:59.680> he's

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
the red but it's not dead so yeah he's

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.140 
the red but it's not dead so yeah he's
not<00:05:59.950> gonna<00:06:00.070> be<00:06:00.160> able<00:06:00.280> to<00:06:00.400> move<00:06:00.520> out<00:06:00.700> with<00:06:00.880> that

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
not gonna be able to move out with that

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.060 
not gonna be able to move out with that
this<00:06:01.450> is<00:06:01.570> a<00:06:01.660> lot<00:06:01.840> for<00:06:02.050> a<00:06:02.110> little<00:06:02.260> while<00:06:02.500> it's

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
this is a lot for a little while it's

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:04.200 
this is a lot for a little while it's
gonna<00:06:03.220> keep<00:06:03.370> it<00:06:03.490> near<00:06:03.640> the<00:06:03.730> front<00:06:03.970> just<00:06:04.030> to

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
gonna keep it near the front just to

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.680 
gonna keep it near the front just to
stop<00:06:04.840> a<00:06:05.050> circling<00:06:05.590> run<00:06:05.710> by<00:06:05.890> from<00:06:06.130> happening

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
stop a circling run by from happening

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.990 
stop a circling run by from happening

Patrick coming up some SimCity here from
zero<00:06:10.360> he's<00:06:10.540> preparing<00:06:11.020> to<00:06:11.770> bunker<00:06:12.490> up

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:12.670 
zero he's preparing to bunker up

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.480 
zero he's preparing to bunker up
basically<00:06:13.270> basically<00:06:14.080> the<00:06:14.560> cirque

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
basically basically the cirque

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.940 
basically basically the cirque
equivalent<00:06:16.060> of<00:06:16.150> a<00:06:16.270> bunker<00:06:16.570> just<00:06:17.320> throwing

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:17.950 
equivalent of a bunker just throwing

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.020 
equivalent of a bunker just throwing
down<00:06:18.100> the<00:06:18.220> second<00:06:18.460> behind<00:06:18.610> all<00:06:18.910> your

down the second behind all your

down the second behind all your

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 
two bases up there at the top the

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.890 
two bases up there at the top the
robotics<00:06:24.160> facility<00:06:24.430> coming<00:06:25.120> down<00:06:25.330> for<00:06:25.660> pure
