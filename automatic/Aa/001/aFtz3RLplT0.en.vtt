00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
folks this is a quick demonstration of

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.480 
folks this is a quick demonstration of
how<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:12.660> set<00:00:13.139> up<00:00:13.170> my<00:00:13.290> stack<00:00:13.769> dado

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
how I set up my stack dado

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.910 
how I set up my stack dado
this<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.059> for<00:00:15.269> my<00:00:15.360> shop<00:00:15.630> Smith<00:00:15.900> it's<00:00:16.590> gonna<00:00:16.740> be

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
this is for my shop Smith it's gonna be

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.849 
this is for my shop Smith it's gonna be
similar<00:00:17.190> for<00:00:17.340> other<00:00:17.630> saws<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:18.900> tools<00:00:19.140> let's

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
similar for other saws and tools let's

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.590 
similar for other saws and tools let's
look<00:00:19.980> at<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.160> different<00:00:20.400> parts<00:00:20.550> here<00:00:20.850> first

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
look at the different parts here first

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.050 
look at the different parts here first
if<00:00:21.720> I<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:22.140> have<00:00:22.260> two<00:00:22.470> outside<00:00:22.949> blades<00:00:23.340> use<00:00:23.910> the

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
if I you have two outside blades use the

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.349 
if I you have two outside blades use the
cutter<00:00:24.269> blades<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:25.580> pay<00:00:26.580> attention<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.180> the

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
cutter blades and pay attention to the

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.700 
cutter blades and pay attention to the
rotation<00:00:27.900> on<00:00:27.990> those<00:00:28.140> which<00:00:28.349> way<00:00:28.529> they<00:00:28.680> go

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
rotation on those which way they go

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.560 
rotation on those which way they go
these<00:00:29.250> are<00:00:29.310> two<00:00:29.519> flat<00:00:29.789> washers<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.390> want<00:00:30.510> to

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
these are two flat washers you want to

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.389 
these are two flat washers you want to
make<00:00:30.660> sure<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:30.869> little<00:00:30.990> rabbit<00:00:31.590> inside<00:00:32.040> goes

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
make sure that little rabbit inside goes

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.930 
make sure that little rabbit inside goes
to<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.730> inside<00:00:33.120> up<00:00:33.899> against<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.640> blades<00:00:35.640> and

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
to the inside up against the blades and

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.430 
to the inside up against the blades and
this<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.420> locking<00:00:36.809> washer<00:00:36.960> it's<00:00:37.290> very

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
this is a locking washer it's very

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.190 
this is a locking washer it's very
important<00:00:37.829> that's<00:00:38.010> on<00:00:38.219> there<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.520> keeps

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
important that's on there that keeps

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.240 
important that's on there that keeps
everything<00:00:40.200> tight<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.680> secure<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.160> it

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
everything tight and secure so it

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.830 
everything tight and secure so it
doesn't<00:00:41.550> move<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.969> then<00:00:42.270> here<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.510> have<00:00:42.809> a

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
doesn't move and then here you have a

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.720 
doesn't move and then here you have a
spacer<00:00:43.469> most<00:00:43.829> data<00:00:44.100> sets<00:00:44.430> will<00:00:44.610> have

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
spacer most data sets will have

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.459 
spacer most data sets will have
different<00:00:44.940> spacers<00:00:45.510> for<00:00:45.690> getting<00:00:46.350> your

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
different spacers for getting your

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.380 
different spacers for getting your
fine-tuning<00:00:47.160> adjustment<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.239> your

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
fine-tuning adjustment this is your

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.819 
fine-tuning adjustment this is your
locking<00:00:48.719> nut<00:00:48.899> it's<00:00:49.110> very<00:00:49.289> important<00:00:49.649> that's

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
locking nut it's very important that's

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.520 
locking nut it's very important that's
on<00:00:50.039> snug<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.820> have<00:00:51.000> at<00:00:51.449> least<00:00:51.629> two

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
on snug and that you have at least two

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.380 
on snug and that you have at least two
threads<00:00:53.100> showing<00:00:53.640> when<00:00:53.820> you're<00:00:53.940> tighten<00:00:54.270> that

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
threads showing when you're tighten that

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.660 
threads showing when you're tighten that
down<00:00:54.649> then<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.770> have<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.980> chippers<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.520> you

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
down then you have the chippers that you

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.439 
down then you have the chippers that you
see<00:00:56.879> there<00:00:57.210> in<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.539> middle<00:00:59.120> first<00:01:00.120> thing<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.390> do

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
see there in the middle first thing I do

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.330 
see there in the middle first thing I do
is<00:01:00.629> put<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.140> washer<00:01:01.559> with<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.010> rabbit

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
is put on the washer with the rabbit

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.299 
is put on the washer with the rabbit
facing<00:01:02.789> up<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:03.960> case<00:01:04.229> I'm<00:01:04.619> going<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.129> take

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
facing up in this case I'm going to take

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.399 
facing up in this case I'm going to take
one<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.729> outside<00:01:06.540> cutters<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.110> put<00:01:07.260> that

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
one of the outside cutters and put that

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.320 
one of the outside cutters and put that
in<00:01:07.560> place<00:01:07.700> again<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.820> see<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.119> way<00:01:09.210> the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
in place again you see the way the

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.910 
in place again you see the way the
rotation<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.990> going<00:01:10.229> there<00:01:10.409> so<00:01:10.590> when<00:01:10.740> it's<00:01:10.830> on

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
rotation is going there so when it's on

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.310 
rotation is going there so when it's on
the<00:01:10.979> saw<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.580> cut<00:01:12.060> will<00:01:12.210> be<00:01:12.330> towards<00:01:12.720> me<00:01:12.869> and

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
the saw the cut will be towards me and

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.310 
the saw the cut will be towards me and
then<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.970> the<00:01:14.970> chipper<00:01:15.330> blades<00:01:15.570> here<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:16.110> want

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
then the the chipper blades here I want

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.840 
then the the chipper blades here I want
to<00:01:16.380> make<00:01:16.500> sure<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.979> teeth<00:01:17.310> are<00:01:17.640> not

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
to make sure that the teeth are not

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.840 
to make sure that the teeth are not
touching<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.360> teeth<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.900> other<00:01:19.850> first

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
touching the teeth of the other first

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.060 
touching the teeth of the other first
blade<00:01:21.210> on<00:01:21.450> there<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:21.869> always<00:01:22.110> position

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
blade on there so I always position

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.920 
blade on there so I always position
those<00:01:23.280> chipper<00:01:24.270> teeth<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:25.140> there's<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:26.930> no

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
those chipper teeth so there's a no

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.480 
those chipper teeth so there's a no
pressure<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.890> it's<00:01:29.159> going<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.369> give

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
pressure on that and it's going to give

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.830 
pressure on that and it's going to give
me<00:01:29.579> an<00:01:29.670> accurate<00:01:29.790> read<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:30.360> each<00:01:30.509> one<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.780> I

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
me an accurate read so each one that I

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.240 
me an accurate read so each one that I
said<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.200> just<00:01:31.439> make<00:01:31.560> sure<00:01:31.710> it's<00:01:31.890> not<00:01:32.009> touching

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
said I just make sure it's not touching

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.880 
said I just make sure it's not touching
any<00:01:32.520> other<00:01:32.729> tooth<00:01:35.240> and<00:01:36.240> we<00:01:36.299> just<00:01:37.170> put<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.470> the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
any other tooth and we just put in the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.440 
any other tooth and we just put in the
number<00:01:38.009> what<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.310> do<00:01:38.430> on<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.150> get<00:01:39.329> the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
number what I do on this to get the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.240 
number what I do on this to get the
spacing<00:01:39.720> right<00:01:40.049> I'm<00:01:40.680> gonna<00:01:40.860> give<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.100> an

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
spacing right I'm gonna give it an

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.880 
spacing right I'm gonna give it an
estimate<00:01:41.729> first<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.180> all<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.840> know<00:01:43.500> on<00:01:43.740> this

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
estimate first of all and I know on this

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.950 
estimate first of all and I know on this
setup<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.369> want<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.670> do<00:01:44.759> here<00:01:45.000> this<00:01:45.810> is

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
setup that I want to do here this is

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.420 
setup that I want to do here this is
going<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.170> be<00:01:46.259> pretty<00:01:46.500> close<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.040> then<00:01:47.399> I

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
going to be pretty close and then I

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.700 
going to be pretty close and then I
might<00:01:47.670> want<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.909> add<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.090> spacer<00:01:48.659> in<00:01:48.990> like<00:01:49.470> this

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
might want to add a spacer in like this

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.590 
might want to add a spacer in like this
if<00:01:50.189> you're<00:01:50.340> gonna<00:01:50.430> add<00:01:50.610> more<00:01:50.820> than<00:01:50.970> one<00:01:51.149> spacer

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
if you're gonna add more than one spacer

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.030 
if you're gonna add more than one spacer
don't<00:01:51.869> add<00:01:51.990> them<00:01:52.140> all<00:01:52.229> at<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.560> same<00:01:52.770> place

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
don't add them all at the same place

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.620 
don't add them all at the same place
kind<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.640> stagger<00:01:54.030> them<00:01:54.149> between<00:01:54.479> your

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
kind of stagger them between your

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.260 
kind of stagger them between your
chippers<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.860> that'll<00:01:56.820> just<00:01:56.850> give<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.240> a

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
chippers and that'll just give you a

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.330 
chippers and that'll just give you a
better<00:01:57.450> result<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:58.140> then<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:58.860> put<00:01:59.040> on<00:01:59.070> the

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
better result and then I put on the

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.910 
better result and then I put on the
outside<00:01:59.549> blade<00:02:00.090> again<00:02:00.469> making<00:02:01.469> sure<00:02:01.710> that

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
then put on the washer with the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.400 
then put on the washer with the

these tighten on clockwise just as a way
that<00:02:23.280> you<00:02:23.670> would<00:02:23.820> think<00:02:23.850> that<00:02:24.060> they<00:02:24.270> would<00:02:24.450> and

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
that you would think that they would and

that you would think that they would and
I'm<00:02:25.260> using<00:02:25.530> my<00:02:26.130> bench<00:02:26.910> here<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:28.680> lay<00:02:28.830> this<00:02:29.040> on

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
I'm using my bench here to lay this on

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.860 
I'm using my bench here to lay this on
what<00:02:29.430> I'm<00:02:29.550> doing<00:02:29.580> is<00:02:29.940> setting<00:02:30.150> this<00:02:30.450> down<00:02:30.660> into

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
what I'm doing is setting this down into

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.540 
what I'm doing is setting this down into
the<00:02:30.930> little<00:02:31.080> gap<00:02:31.410> there<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:32.010> I<00:02:32.280> want<00:02:32.400> to<00:02:32.460> make

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
the little gap there and I want to make

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.130 
the little gap there and I want to make
sure<00:02:32.580> that's<00:02:32.820> all<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.060> way<00:02:33.180> down<00:02:33.390> flat<00:02:33.780> on<00:02:33.990> the

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
sure that's all the way down flat on the

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.870 
sure that's all the way down flat on the
table<00:02:36.680> you'll<00:02:37.680> see<00:02:37.770> why<00:02:38.040> that<00:02:38.070> is<00:02:38.400> there<00:02:38.640> we<00:02:38.760> go

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
table you'll see why that is there we go

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.700 
table you'll see why that is there we go
now<00:02:39.060> it's<00:02:39.210> down<00:02:39.360> flat<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:40.200> reason<00:02:40.530> for<00:02:40.650> that

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
now it's down flat the reason for that

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.500 
now it's down flat the reason for that
is<00:02:41.070> now<00:02:41.220> I<00:02:41.250> can<00:02:41.520> take<00:02:41.640> a<00:02:41.700> scrap<00:02:42.030> piece<00:02:42.270> of<00:02:42.300> the

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
is now I can take a scrap piece of the

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.060 
is now I can take a scrap piece of the
wood<00:02:42.690> that<00:02:42.720> I'll<00:02:42.930> be<00:02:43.080> working<00:02:43.470> with<00:02:43.500> this<00:02:43.860> is

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
wood that I'll be working with this is

in<00:02:44.520> this<00:02:44.610> case<00:02:44.670> it's<00:02:45.060> plywood<00:02:45.500> they<00:02:46.500> call<00:02:46.680> it

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
in this case it's plywood they call it

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.080 
in this case it's plywood they call it
three-quarter<00:02:47.310> inch<00:02:47.460> but<00:02:47.640> it<00:02:47.730> may<00:02:47.820> or<00:02:47.940> may<00:02:48.060> not

three-quarter inch but it may or may not
be<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.720> I'll<00:02:48.990> just<00:02:49.140> lay<00:02:49.350> it<00:02:49.500> right<00:02:49.680> there<00:02:49.890> next

be and I'll just lay it right there next

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.070 
be and I'll just lay it right there next
to<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.430> tooth<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:50.820> use<00:02:50.940> my<00:02:51.150> finger<00:02:51.540> you<00:02:51.720> know

to the tooth and use my finger you know
your<00:02:52.230> fingers<00:02:52.530> are<00:02:52.680> much<00:02:52.800> more<00:02:52.980> sensitive

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
your fingers are much more sensitive

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.830 
your fingers are much more sensitive
than<00:02:53.580> your<00:02:53.730> eyes<00:02:53.850> if<00:02:54.120> you're<00:02:54.270> a<00:02:54.300> normal<00:02:54.540> human

than your eyes if you're a normal human
being<00:02:55.190> they<00:02:56.190> say<00:02:56.640> you<00:02:56.700> can<00:02:56.970> detect<00:02:57.300> a

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
being they say you can detect a

being they say you can detect a
thousandth<00:02:57.960> of<00:02:58.020> an<00:02:58.140> inch<00:02:58.230> I'm<00:02:58.530> not<00:02:58.680> sure<00:02:59.060> what

thousandth of an inch I'm not sure what

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.940 
thousandth of an inch I'm not sure what
that<00:03:00.240> really<00:03:00.390> is<00:03:00.660> but<00:03:00.930> we'll<00:03:01.530> just<00:03:01.710> go<00:03:01.860> ahead

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
that really is but we'll just go ahead

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.130 
that really is but we'll just go ahead
and<00:03:02.190> clamp<00:03:02.850> it<00:03:02.970> into<00:03:03.210> the<00:03:03.300> bench<00:03:03.660> here<00:03:03.900> and

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
tighten it down with the wrenches if you

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.310 
tighten it down with the wrenches if you
don't<00:03:06.240> have<00:03:06.360> these<00:03:06.510> wrenches<00:03:06.780> you<00:03:07.050> can<00:03:07.200> use

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
don't have these wrenches you can use

open end wrenches or whatever just make

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.730 
open end wrenches or whatever just make
sure<00:03:09.390> it<00:03:09.480> fits<00:03:09.690> snugly<00:03:09.960> so<00:03:10.230> it<00:03:10.290> doesn't<00:03:10.560> slip

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
sure it fits snugly so it doesn't slip

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.390 
sure it fits snugly so it doesn't slip
in<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.220> ding<00:03:11.850> your<00:03:11.970> fingers<00:03:12.330> on<00:03:12.510> this<00:03:13.400> this

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
in and ding your fingers on this this

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.550 
in and ding your fingers on this this
tightens<00:03:14.850> clockwise<00:03:15.390> just<00:03:15.630> as<00:03:16.290> you<00:03:16.440> would

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
tightens clockwise just as you would

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.990 
tightens clockwise just as you would
expect<00:03:16.650> but<00:03:17.130> it's<00:03:17.250> not<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.580> way<00:03:17.700> that<00:03:17.850> the

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
expect but it's not the way that the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.880 
expect but it's not the way that the
normal<00:03:18.360> shops<00:03:18.630> nose<00:03:18.900> saw<00:03:19.110> ever<00:03:19.470> tightens<00:03:19.830> down

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
normal shops nose saw ever tightens down

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.420 
normal shops nose saw ever tightens down
so<00:03:20.280> you<00:03:20.400> go<00:03:20.520> clockwise<00:03:21.050> get<00:03:22.050> it<00:03:22.140> snug<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:22.920> then

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
so you go clockwise get it snug and then

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.310 
so you go clockwise get it snug and then
I<00:03:23.459> like<00:03:23.700> to<00:03:23.730> give<00:03:23.970> it<00:03:24.060> a<00:03:24.180> little<00:03:24.480> extra<00:03:24.690> because

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
I like to give it a little extra because

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.510 
I like to give it a little extra because
I'm<00:03:25.440> gonna<00:03:25.530> make<00:03:25.620> sure<00:03:25.860> that's<00:03:25.980> on<00:03:26.190> there<00:03:26.370> nice

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
I'm gonna make sure that's on there nice

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.090 
I'm gonna make sure that's on there nice
nice<00:03:27.300> and<00:03:27.570> snug<00:03:27.840> you<00:03:28.620> don't<00:03:28.770> have<00:03:28.860> to<00:03:28.950> get

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
nice and snug you don't have to get

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.560 
nice and snug you don't have to get
crazy<00:03:29.340> with<00:03:29.489> it<00:03:29.760> but<00:03:29.910> that's<00:03:30.209> really<00:03:30.480> all

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
crazy with it but that's really all

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.830 
crazy with it but that's really all
there<00:03:30.690> is<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.989> it<00:03:31.080> right<00:03:31.230> there<00:03:32.480> you<00:03:33.480> could<00:03:33.690> go

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
there is to it right there you could go

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.330 
there is to it right there you could go
ahead<00:03:33.930> and<00:03:34.170> mount<00:03:34.260> it<00:03:34.500> into<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:34.830> Shopsmith

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
ahead and mount it into the Shopsmith

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.890 
ahead and mount it into the Shopsmith
with<00:03:35.580> the<00:03:35.640> machine<00:03:35.940> unplugged<00:03:36.330> and<00:03:36.540> tighten

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
with the machine unplugged and tighten

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.870 
with the machine unplugged and tighten
it<00:03:36.930> there<00:03:37.170> that<00:03:37.380> works<00:03:37.560> pretty<00:03:37.800> well<00:03:37.920> too<00:03:38.280> once

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
it there that works pretty well too once

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.400 
it there that works pretty well too once
I<00:03:39.000> tighten<00:03:39.390> it<00:03:39.450> I<00:03:39.510> could<00:03:39.780> check<00:03:39.989> it<00:03:40.140> again

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
I tighten it I could check it again

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.350 
I tighten it I could check it again
because<00:03:40.920> when<00:03:41.220> you<00:03:41.310> do<00:03:41.430> tighten<00:03:41.790> it<00:03:41.850> obviously

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
because when you do tighten it obviously

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.410 
because when you do tighten it obviously
it's<00:03:42.510> gonna<00:03:43.220> possibly<00:03:44.220> vary<00:03:45.030> a<00:03:45.120> little<00:03:45.270> bit

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
it's gonna possibly vary a little bit

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.000 
it's gonna possibly vary a little bit
and<00:03:45.750> I<00:03:45.989> like<00:03:46.170> to<00:03:46.290> go<00:03:46.380> all<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.560> way<00:03:46.590> around

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
and I like to go all the way around

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.800 
and I like to go all the way around
because<00:03:47.190> sometimes<00:03:47.760> these<00:03:47.940> teeth<00:03:48.360> are<00:03:48.600> not

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
because sometimes these teeth are not

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.640 
because sometimes these teeth are not
exactly<00:03:49.350> the<00:03:49.530> same<00:03:49.770> size<00:03:50.959> it's<00:03:51.959> unfortunate

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
exactly the same size it's unfortunate

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.370 
exactly the same size it's unfortunate
that<00:03:52.880> they<00:03:53.880> won't<00:03:54.330> be<00:03:54.510> as<00:03:54.600> accurate<00:03:54.840> as<00:03:55.080> maybe

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
that they won't be as accurate as maybe

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.320 
that they won't be as accurate as maybe
you<00:03:55.530> wanted<00:03:55.739> to<00:03:55.830> be<00:03:55.980> so<00:03:56.670> I<00:03:56.700> go<00:03:57.120> all<00:03:57.239> the<00:03:57.270> way

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
you wanted to be so I go all the way

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.670 
you wanted to be so I go all the way
around<00:03:57.480> check<00:03:57.900> it<00:03:58.020> with<00:03:58.110> that<00:03:58.230> and<00:03:58.410> I<00:03:58.500> should

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
around check it with that and I should

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.229 
around check it with that and I should
be<00:03:58.830> good<00:03:58.980> to<00:03:59.100> go<00:03:59.220> then<00:03:59.400> I'll<00:03:59.520> make<00:03:59.640> a<00:03:59.670> test<00:04:00.000> cut

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
be good to go then I'll make a test cut

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.150 
be good to go then I'll make a test cut
just<00:04:00.750> to<00:04:00.900> be<00:04:00.989> sure<00:04:01.020> that<00:04:01.380> everything<00:04:01.770> is<00:04:01.890> where

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
just to be sure that everything is where

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.800 
just to be sure that everything is where
I<00:04:02.190> want<00:04:02.459> it<00:04:02.520> to<00:04:02.670> be<00:04:04.700> and<00:04:05.700> here<00:04:06.420> is<00:04:06.540> an<00:04:06.720> example

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
I want it to be and here is an example

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.180 
I want it to be and here is an example
of<00:04:07.350> a<00:04:08.780> dado<00:04:09.780> that<00:04:10.050> I<00:04:10.080> made<00:04:10.320> using<00:04:10.530> this<00:04:10.800> setup

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
of a dado that I made using this setup

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.460 
of a dado that I made using this setup
and<00:04:11.430> it's<00:04:12.000> a<00:04:12.120> pretty<00:04:12.300> good<00:04:12.510> fit

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
and it's a pretty good fit

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.789 
and it's a pretty good fit
I<00:04:13.500> could<00:04:13.950> have<00:04:14.040> perhaps<00:04:15.080> made<00:04:16.080> that<00:04:16.320> just<00:04:16.620> a

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
I could have perhaps made that just a

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.310 
I could have perhaps made that just a
touch<00:04:17.459> tighter<00:04:17.820> but<00:04:18.419> I'm<00:04:18.540> doing<00:04:18.900> it<00:04:18.930> like<00:04:19.140> this

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
touch tighter but I'm doing it like this

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.320 
touch tighter but I'm doing it like this
it's<00:04:19.650> gonna<00:04:19.769> be<00:04:19.980> definitely<00:04:20.700> strong<00:04:20.970> enough<00:04:21.000> I

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
it's gonna be definitely strong enough I

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:22.760 
it's gonna be definitely strong enough I
don't<00:04:21.479> have<00:04:21.630> to<00:04:21.720> worry<00:04:21.900> about<00:04:21.960> it<00:04:22.260> and<00:04:22.380> also

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
don't have to worry about it and also

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.890 
don't have to worry about it and also
I'm<00:04:23.010> going<00:04:23.160> to<00:04:23.250> put<00:04:23.370> some<00:04:23.550> kind<00:04:23.729> of<00:04:23.850> a<00:04:23.940> a<00:04:24.360> face

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
I'm going to put some kind of a a face

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.629 
I'm going to put some kind of a a face
frame<00:04:25.200> or<00:04:25.410> trim<00:04:25.680> pre<00:04:25.860> trim<00:04:26.370> piece

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
frame or trim pre trim piece

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.459 
frame or trim pre trim piece
in<00:04:26.789> front<00:04:26.999> of<00:04:27.060> that<00:04:27.150> so<00:04:27.360> that<00:04:27.509> won't<00:04:27.629> show<00:04:27.930> so<00:04:28.229> I

00:04:28.459 --> 00:04:28.469 
in front of that so that won't show so I

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:30.170 
in front of that so that won't show so I
get<00:04:28.949> both<00:04:29.129> the<00:04:29.280> strength<00:04:29.580> and<00:04:29.729> the<00:04:29.819> looks<00:04:30.030> that

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
get both the strength and the looks that

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.879 
get both the strength and the looks that
I<00:04:30.330> want<00:04:30.659> so<00:04:31.110> that's<00:04:31.199> really<00:04:31.409> about<00:04:31.530> all<00:04:31.650> there

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
I want so that's really about all there

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:33.260 
I want so that's really about all there
is<00:04:31.949> to<00:04:32.009> it<00:04:32.340> if<00:04:32.669> you<00:04:32.789> don't<00:04:32.939> have<00:04:33.090> those

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
is to it if you don't have those

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.909 
is to it if you don't have those
particular<00:04:33.479> wrenches<00:04:34.110> guys<00:04:34.289> you<00:04:34.469> can<00:04:34.590> use<00:04:34.740> any

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
particular wrenches guys you can use any

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.980 
particular wrenches guys you can use any
any<00:04:35.520> adjustable<00:04:36.120> wrenches<00:04:36.479> or<00:04:36.599> whatever<00:04:36.900> you

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
any adjustable wrenches or whatever you

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.390 
any adjustable wrenches or whatever you
have<00:04:37.139> around<00:04:37.259> just<00:04:37.529> make<00:04:37.680> sure<00:04:37.830> that<00:04:38.009> they<00:04:38.129> fit

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
have around just make sure that they fit

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.010 
have around just make sure that they fit
well<00:04:38.580> so<00:04:38.849> they<00:04:38.969> don't<00:04:38.999> slip<00:04:39.389> off<00:04:39.539> of<00:04:39.719> there<00:04:39.900> and

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
well so they don't slip off of there and

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.200 
well so they don't slip off of there and
that's<00:04:40.590> about<00:04:40.800> all<00:04:40.949> there<00:04:41.159> is<00:04:41.219> to<00:04:41.430> it<00:04:41.550> I'm

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
that's about all there is to it I'm

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.179 
that's about all there is to it I'm
gonna<00:04:42.389> go<00:04:42.569> ahead<00:04:42.689> and<00:04:42.810> mount<00:04:43.050> the<00:04:43.199> dado<00:04:43.710> on<00:04:44.009> to

00:04:44.179 --> 00:04:44.189 
gonna go ahead and mount the dado on to

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:45.980 
gonna go ahead and mount the dado on to
the<00:04:44.310> Shopsmith<00:04:44.969> now<00:04:45.150> I'm<00:04:45.270> using<00:04:45.479> a<00:04:45.629> new<00:04:45.749> Power

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
the Shopsmith now I'm using a new Power

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.659 
the Shopsmith now I'm using a new Power
Pro<00:04:46.289> and<00:04:46.770> this<00:04:46.860> is<00:04:47.009> the<00:04:47.099> first<00:04:47.279> time<00:04:47.490> I've<00:04:47.639> used

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
Pro and this is the first time I've used

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.409 
Pro and this is the first time I've used
it<00:04:48.120> the<00:04:48.599> dado<00:04:48.810> since<00:04:49.139> I<00:04:49.229> got<00:04:49.349> the<00:04:49.499> power<00:04:49.680> Pro

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
it the dado since I got the power Pro

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:53.749 
it the dado since I got the power Pro
but<00:04:51.419> I<00:04:51.629> was<00:04:51.930> really<00:04:52.289> amazed<00:04:52.710> at<00:04:52.949> how<00:04:53.099> well<00:04:53.550> this

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759 
but I was really amazed at how well this

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:55.339 
but I was really amazed at how well this
cut<00:04:54.060> that's<00:04:54.270> a<00:04:54.389> pretty<00:04:54.569> hefty<00:04:54.840> dado

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:55.349 
cut that's a pretty hefty dado

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:59.689 
cut that's a pretty hefty dado
I'm<00:04:56.219> cutting<00:04:56.639> about<00:04:57.949> 5/8<00:04:58.949> of<00:04:59.129> an<00:04:59.279> inch<00:04:59.370> deep

00:04:59.689 --> 00:04:59.699 
I'm cutting about 5/8 of an inch deep

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:02.839
