00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:53.500
 our secret is on the galaxy note but not 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.260
 we find the possibility of doing e 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.559
 decide phone calls so there is the 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.870

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.759
 automatically that will come out at zoom 21 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.080
 for itself of ashes the pixel resolution 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.520
 in the lateral part 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.180

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:22.680
 flash mechanical flash coming out in this 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.530
 xenon flash mode 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.780
 the camera allows you to shoot videos 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.520
 in full hd obviously at 30 frames per 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.570
 second that also allows to carry out 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.920
 slow motion in 123 but in the second 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.530
 in this side we have the registration 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:42.570
 of the video thematically part while 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:45.270

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.130
 make zoom zoom 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.040
 in peru not yet in more mode 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.150

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.150
 we miss you 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.950
 in short, at most valid targets come out 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.340
 really very much just because it 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.509
 zoom 21 for is really a lot 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.729
 always to the sails of cameras we have 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.430
 lots of options and features too 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.819
 allow us to manage the machine with 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.800
 many present already pre configured 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:16.790
 we hope a whole series of settings 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.260
 very instagram style colors and all 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.470
 then the settings for how much 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.000
 it's about functionality 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.610
 in the camera with a whole series of 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.070
 137 that we see here really are 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.560
 many are looking for the first one 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.560
 time I am not a photography expert 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.420
 as you know how we see there are 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.160
 really a lot of options that 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.790
 automatic and the one we present but 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.710
 if you are an expert you know what I am 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:46.250
 face how all the various e 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:48.110
 focal openings the various manual options 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.690
 you can still go to set up 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.490
 manually the camera with lots of 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.010
 parameters that at this time 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:58.230
 we really don't know 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.930
 an absolutely special product 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.170
 hybrid we will also see what they will present 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.450
 i phone 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.780
 if similar to this product it is 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.750
 characterized by a 1.4 processor 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.670
 ghz who exercised for this 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.700
 camera considering the battery 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.370
 integrated and from 1,650 milan for then 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.050
 maybe many hours of video will be difficult 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.210
 turn 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.890
 however, it is a particular product 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:27.870
 unique we will see how to respond 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.870
