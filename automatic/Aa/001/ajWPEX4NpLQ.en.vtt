last resort be helped to move away to a
less<00:00:55.469> risk<00:00:55.770> area<00:00:56.239> so<00:00:57.239> some<00:00:57.570> drastic<00:00:57.899> thinking

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
less risk area so some drastic thinking

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.950 
less risk area so some drastic thinking
as<00:00:58.800> this<00:00:59.070> waterlogged<00:00:59.760> winter<00:01:00.149> affects<00:01:00.719> so

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
as this waterlogged winter affects so

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.529 
as this waterlogged winter affects so
much<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.440> country<00:01:01.859> one<00:01:02.489> emerging<00:01:03.180> idea

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
much of the country one emerging idea

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.149 
much of the country one emerging idea
about<00:01:03.809> flooding<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.739> if<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.979> right

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
about flooding is that if the right

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.280 
about flooding is that if the right
things<00:01:05.519> are<00:01:05.670> done<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:05.880> one<00:01:06.240> area<00:01:06.510> they<00:01:07.229> can

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
things are done in one area they can

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.310 
things are done in one area they can
really<00:01:07.680> help<00:01:07.830> another<00:01:08.540> one<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.659> several<00:01:10.110> ways

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
really help another one of several ways

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.200 
really help another one of several ways
to<00:01:10.380> try<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.830> prevent<00:01:11.250> flooding<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.909> it's<00:01:12.030> the

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
to try to prevent flooding and it's the

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.899 
to try to prevent flooding and it's the
cheapest<00:01:12.720> option<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.890> trap<00:01:14.189> rainwater

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
cheapest option is to trap rainwater

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.359 
cheapest option is to trap rainwater
that<00:01:15.180> falls<00:01:15.240> upstream<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.680> hills<00:01:16.950> by

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
that falls upstream in the hills by

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.670 
that falls upstream in the hills by
creating<00:01:17.850> natural<00:01:18.360> barriers<00:01:18.869> but<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:19.500> can

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
creating natural barriers but this can

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.190 
creating natural barriers but this can
be<00:01:19.710> controversial<00:01:20.280> with<00:01:20.610> farmers<00:01:21.090> efforts<00:01:22.049> to

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
be controversial with farmers efforts to

be controversial with farmers efforts to
dredge<00:01:22.470> rivers<00:01:23.009> can<00:01:23.340> help<00:01:23.640> locally<00:01:24.180> but

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
dredge rivers can help locally but

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.899 
dredge rivers can help locally but
that's<00:01:24.900> expensive<00:01:25.590> because<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.220> silt<00:01:26.520> keeps

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
that's expensive because the silt keeps

that's expensive because the silt keeps

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.480 
building up the final defense flood
