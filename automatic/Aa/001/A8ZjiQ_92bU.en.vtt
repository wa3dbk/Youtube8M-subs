00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.920
 Igor Mayor Lenkom 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.920
 presents 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.590

 yes there is of course there is 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:30.910
 money test with a simple example 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:33.450
 it's easy to say this person live in 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.760
 he had no money he interrupted 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.100
 from bread to kvass to get paid 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.970
 belly paycheck paycheck and suddenly 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:46.059
 something happened that's got it jet up 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:50.050
 feed turned the right way and to 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:54.760
 money went to him and he started getting 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:59.170
 big income but this man is not yet 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.750
 I was ready to come to him 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:06.030
 big profits remember how there is a tower 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:08.670
 about a bag of money when 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.640
 but there the court is such that we will bag with 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.799
 money, and when it was money he 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.070
 I began to nonsense not carry it all 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.460
 you 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.229
 command but when is money out of it 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.840
 poured out taken away 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.479
 this and this is big thrown into the hallways in 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.110
 he wiped his legs you understand this 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.960
 metaphor 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.220
 here the same thing happens when u 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.700
 man money appears here just 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:38.940
 its inner qualities are enhanced 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.490
 for example have this person been in 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.490
 quotes good all and this man was 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.030
 sincerely it will be so clearer to you to speak 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.119
 He says that it is enhanced if 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:55.729
 there was something inside it 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:59.659
 is it here or something else 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:02.100
 negative then she money crown 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.590
 right seen on the streets drive cars 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.090
 black ones come out black people in 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.990
 black 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.690
 and wait and it is clear from them that others 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.960
 and because we are rich and wealthy and 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.440
 Now they have their own there is no live for 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.940
 brother 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.740
 money test difficult test 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.960
 many people pass this test 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.470
 several times though several times for 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.510
 you can know your life and this test 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:35.400
 what to compare here is a man won in 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:38.180
 lottery danga not so money someone who 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.459
 then they invest their education 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.219
 someone has propet about walks and who 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.349
 then their just management and u never 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:47.860
 will see this money and they have no meadow 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:51.560
 will not bring benefit 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:54.349
 test money is desirable to pass 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.170
 so that with you there was a mentor that 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:59.569
 passed already to the test because 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.019
 friends when big come to you 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:05.630
 money you may not notice that this is something 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.610
 what is happening to you their have trials 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.250
 money you can think what is it that 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.239
 whatever someone's to blame that's what you 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.420
 so cool 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.920
 actually there is a process 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.890
 test ground 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:23.090
 this process sends space for 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:25.810
 whether a person can experience 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.069
 handle such energy and or not 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.640
 it often happens that people can't 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:33.890
 coping they start moving away and 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:38.180
 in drugs and even with brother we are shorter 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.790
 a lot happen some even 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.219
 end the life of the frame 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.430
 why because they could not cope with 

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:48.040
 so then sweat money and so friends 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.920
 be careful when you start 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.829
 money must appear 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.060
 track if you are of course with 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:58.780
 mentor right 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:02.349
 and if you are proudly alone 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:07.130
 be sure to follow then what are you 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:10.940
 think that's necessary 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.620
 we can even register what gives you 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.430
 such a big family 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.590
 that's how you helped other people if you 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:24.290
 really learned how to help others 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:26.830
 people and not you appreciate your relationship in 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.610
 Overall with the world improved much 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:34.169
 yes you passed the test 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:38.750
 if what I called worsened 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.750
 relationships have appeared some new 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:45.700
 negative 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.700
 HIV is still something most likely 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.610
 and petition to create a day 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:55.440
 it's very dangerous why because during 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:59.290
 feeding time in money and in the etheric worlds 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:02.530
 there is a rotation of the entity and here 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.210
 entities that are attracted to 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.220
 a lot of money they 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.560
 stick to this man and 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.820
 starts to control his mind and already 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.810
 he does not know 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.080
 you probably 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:16.680
 at least once seen a movie there is a movie toy 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.150
 or anything else Francis when there 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.409
 a man whose big money he is there 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.950
 is engaged in any crap 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:27.870
 inadequate 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:30.110
 so please pay attention 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.810
 even if you have now 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:35.220
 I like them a small income with what 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.310
 either up 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.860
 increased your bid to 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.870
 start tracking this way 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.530
 as you pass at the moment 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.530
 test
