eventually there you can see their

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.260 
eventually there you can see their
time's<00:01:55.590> running<00:01:55.800> out<00:01:56.040> for<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.850> peaceful

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
time's running out for the the peaceful

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.609 
time's running out for the the peaceful
life<00:01:57.479> as<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.780> were<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.080> then<00:01:58.170> this<00:01:58.290> kind<00:01:58.500> of

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
life as it were and then this kind of

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.889 
life as it were and then this kind of
like<00:01:58.770> shields<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.820> knocks<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.600> ball<00:02:00.630> back

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
like shields it knocks the ball back

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.690 
like shields it knocks the ball back
into<00:02:01.110> there<00:02:01.410> they're<00:02:01.800> caught<00:02:02.100> there's<00:02:02.550> havoc

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
into there they're caught there's havoc

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.550 
into there they're caught there's havoc
all<00:02:02.910> kind<00:02:03.149> of<00:02:03.240> things<00:02:03.390> so<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.840> think<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.410> was

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
all kind of things so I think that was

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.830 
all kind of things so I think that was
probably<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.310> best<00:02:05.490> bit<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:06.450> shoot<00:02:06.660> it

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
probably the best bit to to shoot it

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.320 
probably the best bit to to shoot it
definitely
