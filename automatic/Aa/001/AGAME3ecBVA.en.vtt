00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.170
 friends what the weather was outside 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.790
 sooner or later the snowstorms change 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.590
 on the warm summer breeze and we are with you 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.210
 we will spend less time at home 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.279
 and increasingly beyond 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.529
 what does this mean for our apple friends 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.940
 right they need to work longer in 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.520
 the form of recharge on the street is not 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.289
 It will turn out of course you can buy here 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.150
 Such a battery case which will extend 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.840
 your iphone's life is at least 3 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.070
 times but with those of you who have n't run yet 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.290
 to shop for such a cover 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.150
 I want to share my savings experience 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.979
 precious charging which has accumulated in 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.690
 me for many years using iphone 

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:43.489
 the first thing you need to do is 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.339
 disable all unnecessary phone features 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.809
 for this we need to go to the settings 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:50.870
 go to the privacy section 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.430
 geolocation service sink to the bottom 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.610
 and connect all system services 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.000
 Believe me, they won't be useful to us. 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.220
 obvious moment 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.269
 but if you don't use Wi-Fi then its 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.979
 itâ€™s better not to turn off bluetooth 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.170
 say nothing uniquely modern 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:07.430
 modules are very energy efficient and if you 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.469
 use bluetooth like you 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.359
 Have bluetooth headphones or bluetooth 

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:14.149
 headsets then don't bother and don't 

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:15.979
 turn it off and here slowly but surely 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:17.899
 we come to the most voracious part 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.630
 our cell phone data 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:20.960
 3g by itself i. does not spend much 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.609
 charge 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.439
 the most critical is that 

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:26.329
 coverage with these networks of our country 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.670
 leave much to be desired and iphone 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:31.789
 constantly switches from 3g to lts ltt 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.289
 on and g and round trip therefore feel free to 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:35.749
 turn off the out and if we do not need 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.759
 fast internet and great 

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:40.009
 use our phones feet at all 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.869
 turn off cellular data method 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.429
 effective but I would not advise because 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.060
 that our phone turns to normal 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:45.800
 dialer 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.140
 notifications stop coming 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.610
 you are completely missing the internet is not 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.490
 forget to turn off modem mode 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.540
 it is natural if we do not use it 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.370
 banal advice on we need to reduce 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.380
 brightness also advise using 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.060
 auto brightness if on the screen of your iphone 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.740
 there is no super armored film 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.600
 which will protect your iphone from nuclear 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.550
 the explosion then the light sensor should 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.410
 work well and also advise 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.280
 calibrate for this we increase 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:12.110
 brightness to the fullest 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.820
 turn on the flashlight on another iphone shine 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.250
 top of the phone and turn on 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.900
 auto brightness so the sensor 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.360
 lighting calibrated to the maximum 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.370
 ok one of the last tips to us 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.660
 need to disable automatic downloads 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.320
 well of course if you donâ€™t 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:34.580
 use for this we need to come in 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:36.440
 aytyunse appstore and automatically yet 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.270
 one controversial point, many believe that 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.190
 need to constantly close previously opened 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.410
 apps afraid to upset you but this is not 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.630
 so the fact is that the operating system 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.700
 with arranged in such a way that closed 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.320
 The application does not continue to work but simply 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.480
 freezes and when you close 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.310
 for example game center and again it 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.690
 opens you have spent resources 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.180
 much more than if you would him 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.920

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.570
 will help to extend the life of your iPhone
