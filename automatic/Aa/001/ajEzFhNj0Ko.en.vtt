 it is during this expedition 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.709
 that his divers have found and rick is clever 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:16.849
 this afternoon 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:20.630
 these English rescuers had attempted a tricky operation to join the 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:21.730
 speleologist 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.439
 stuck for eight days in the bowels of the fishing gorges 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.769
 he wanted to go up the underground river 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.589
 go 800 meters in the dark 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:34.190
 and cross the mans balls that blocks the gallery 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.200
 it was during this expedition that the speleologist's body was found 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.399
 the two men responsible for research 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.300
 you can announce your death with the press 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.150
 he was served was found 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.930
 but the chances are minimal 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.930
 after the roof by the British diver 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.190
 the new savings plan more information in your pocket 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.460
 statements 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.850
 this afternoon the sous-préfet had first raised a problem of 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.850
 material to explain the return of British divers 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.350
 for all ept it's consternation in the hope was great to regain 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.230
 the caver 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.240
 I am happy I am appalled a judge I am extremely moved 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.270
 because it is 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.240
 to lead to 46-year-old cavers 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.729
 eric establie was very experienced 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.070
 he is one of the best in the world in his specialty diver he directed 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:56.080
 a maritime works company in cannes 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.510
 it is by mapping this underground river that has died 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.560
 he was father of a boy 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.070
 by winning at labastide-de-virac ardeche in Hungarian found vis-à-vis 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.739
 donations chimneys is envisaged one imagines of course that it is the shock 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.739
 and the sadness among the rescuers 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:17.519
 yes he announces the death of eric establie raised 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.170
 here in the fishing gorges a great emotion 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.890
 a great disappointment and sadness so this is true relief operations 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.610
 have required a huge technical and logistical device but since eight 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.130
 days since his disappearance the searches to find the 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.020
 speleologist 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.080
 had raised a huge surge of solidarity so of course among the 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.420
 firefighters the art of going to other departments and then of course among 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.940
 speleologists and especially in this very closed circle what is called this 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.969
 international circle which is a floor only maybe a dozen 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:50.809
 a dozen degrees 

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:55.029
 2 a dozen specialists in the world what is called the 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:56.359
 diving caving 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:59.729
 she is ashamed when the death of the Olympic Stadium 

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:04.409
 so it's still too early we have no information 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:08.689
 concerning the date and causes of the death of eric establie probably the 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:13.109
 investigators will be brought to analyze these stages these signs of life that have 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.100
 been recorded captured 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.290

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.540
 grazia rassaa material 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.280
 a material that can send signals in the basement to 200 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.919
 meters deep 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:30.059

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:31.589
