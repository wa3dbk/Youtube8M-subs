00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
stretch they just kind of go forward and

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.289 
stretch they just kind of go forward and
maybe<00:00:04.350> a<00:00:04.410> little<00:00:04.529> bit<00:00:04.710> of<00:00:04.799> cyber<00:00:05.069> you<00:00:05.970> know<00:00:06.060> but

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
every day they neglect that rotation

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.640 
every day they neglect that rotation
because<00:00:09.450> this<00:00:09.809> is<00:00:09.960> actually<00:00:10.170> when<00:00:10.530> you<00:00:10.559> think

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
because this is actually when you think

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.740
