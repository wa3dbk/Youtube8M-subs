00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.450 
chaplain and also I teach theology there
and<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:22.080> don't<00:00:22.740> know<00:00:22.920> about<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.189> but<00:00:23.310> I'm

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
and I don't know about you but I'm

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.790 
and I don't know about you but I'm
having<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.939> really<00:00:24.150> fab<00:00:24.570> Greenbelt<00:00:25.140> this<00:00:25.500> year

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
having a really fab Greenbelt this year

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.070 
having a really fab Greenbelt this year
I<00:00:26.010> like<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.029> theme<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.570> know<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.779> art<00:00:27.960> of

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
I like the theme you know the art of

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.040 
I like the theme you know the art of
looking<00:00:28.439> sideways<00:00:28.800> really<00:00:29.369> appeals<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.880> me

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
looking sideways really appeals to me

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.020 
looking sideways really appeals to me
partly<00:00:31.740> because<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:32.070> think<00:00:32.130> that<00:00:32.399> sums<00:00:32.850> up

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
partly because I think that sums up

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.209 
partly because I think that sums up
Greenbelt<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:33.690> any<00:00:33.840> case<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.410> think<00:00:34.800> Greenbelt

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
Greenbelt in any case I think Greenbelt

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.639 
Greenbelt in any case I think Greenbelt
always<00:00:35.550> takes<00:00:35.850> was<00:00:36.059> slightly<00:00:36.360> askance<00:00:37.260> look

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
always takes was slightly askance look

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.869 
always takes was slightly askance look
at<00:00:38.250> faith<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.149> life<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.840> justice<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.879> has

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
at faith and life and justice and has

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.810 
at faith and life and justice and has
the<00:00:42.059> effect<00:00:42.390> on<00:00:42.570> me<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:43.190> making<00:00:44.190> me<00:00:44.309> want<00:00:44.520> to

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
the effect on me of making me want to

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.639 
the effect on me of making me want to
respond<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.899> world<00:00:45.930> in<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.469> way<00:00:46.500> that

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
respond to the world in a way that

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.350 
respond to the world in a way that
perhaps<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:47.070> hadn't<00:00:47.280> quite<00:00:47.370> thought<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.910> before

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
perhaps I hadn't quite thought of before

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.970 
perhaps I hadn't quite thought of before
so<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:48.899> think<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.140> art<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.410> looking<00:00:49.500> sideways

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
so I think the art of looking sideways

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.110 
so I think the art of looking sideways
is<00:00:50.129> an<00:00:50.219> excellent<00:00:50.610> title<00:00:51.600> for<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.870> festival

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
is an excellent title for the festival

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.880 
is an excellent title for the festival
but<00:00:54.120> in<00:00:54.300> particular<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.989> was<00:00:55.079> quite<00:00:55.379> neat<00:00:55.649> for

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
but in particular it was quite neat for

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.099 
but in particular it was quite neat for
me<00:00:55.980> because<00:00:56.340> my<00:00:56.550> book<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:57.030> came<00:00:57.210> out<00:00:57.449> this

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
me because my book that came out this

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.680 
me because my book that came out this
year<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.800> about<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.370> Bible<00:00:59.850> in<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.239> way<00:01:00.390> it's

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
year is about the Bible in in a way it's

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.260 
year is about the Bible in in a way it's
an<00:01:00.870> askance<00:01:01.350> look<00:01:01.710> at<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.609> way<00:01:02.730> we<00:01:02.940> read<00:01:03.120> the

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
an askance look at the way we read the

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.350 
an askance look at the way we read the
Bible<00:01:03.860> I've<00:01:04.860> been<00:01:05.189> researching<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.150> writing

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
Bible I've been researching and writing

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.590 
Bible I've been researching and writing
for<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.869> last<00:01:06.900> year<00:01:07.290> or<00:01:07.439> two<00:01:07.729> about<00:01:08.729> how<00:01:09.540> the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
for the last year or two about how the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.420 
for the last year or two about how the
Bible<00:01:09.990> appears<00:01:10.830> in<00:01:12.110> culture<00:01:13.110> quite<00:01:13.950> apart

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
Bible appears in culture quite apart

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.719 
Bible appears in culture quite apart
from<00:01:14.720> religion<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.070> the<00:01:17.070> reason<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.610> I've

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
from religion and the reason that I've

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.060 
from religion and the reason that I've
got<00:01:17.909> interested<00:01:18.390> in<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.840> because<00:01:19.229> in<00:01:19.619> my

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
got interested in this is because in my

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.770 
got interested in this is because in my
job<00:01:20.430> at<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.610> University<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.180> spend<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.630> lot<00:01:21.750> of

job at the University I spend a lot of

they don't just learn them as part of a

general background now it's partly

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.210 
general background now it's partly
because<00:01:48.030> religious<00:01:48.720> education<00:01:49.409> has<00:01:49.560> changed

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
because religious education has changed

just beautifully organized that's just

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.219 
just beautifully organized that's just
one<00:04:56.520> little<00:04:56.729> example<00:04:57.000> but<00:04:59.720> there<00:05:00.720> are<00:05:00.840> so<00:05:01.050> many

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
one little example but there are so many

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:03.230 
one little example but there are so many

where<00:05:03.360> you<00:05:03.389> need<00:05:03.690> that<00:05:03.720> let<00:05:04.380> me<00:05:04.409> tell<00:05:04.650> you

where you need that let me tell you

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.950 
where you need that let me tell you
another<00:05:04.800> example<00:05:05.520> if<00:05:05.789> I<00:05:06.240> said<00:05:06.479> to<00:05:06.599> you<00:05:06.720> measure

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
another example if I said to you measure

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.629 
another example if I said to you measure
for<00:05:07.229> measure<00:05:07.409> I'm<00:05:07.680> sure<00:05:08.009> you<00:05:08.159> would<00:05:08.280> all<00:05:08.400> think

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
for measure I'm sure you would all think

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.879 
for measure I'm sure you would all think
of<00:05:08.849> Shakespeare<00:05:09.509> but<00:05:10.259> if<00:05:10.380> you<00:05:10.440> said<00:05:10.650> measure

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:10.889 
of Shakespeare but if you said measure

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:12.409 
of Shakespeare but if you said measure
to<00:05:11.130> measure<00:05:11.250> to<00:05:11.699> Shakespeare's<00:05:12.300> audience

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
to measure to Shakespeare's audience

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:15.260 
to measure to Shakespeare's audience
they<00:05:13.349> would<00:05:13.560> think<00:05:13.740> of<00:05:13.949> Jesus<00:05:14.159> because<00:05:15.120> it

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
they would think of Jesus because it

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.999 
they would think of Jesus because it
comes<00:05:15.539> from<00:05:15.870> the<00:05:15.990> Sermon<00:05:16.199> on<00:05:16.409> the<00:05:16.470> Mount<00:05:16.710> and

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:17.009 
comes from the Sermon on the Mount and

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:19.969 
comes from the Sermon on the Mount and
if<00:05:17.400> you<00:05:17.490> listen<00:05:17.759> to<00:05:18.090> Shakespeare's<00:05:18.690> play<00:05:18.990> not

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 
if you listen to Shakespeare's play not

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:21.740 
if you listen to Shakespeare's play not
knowing<00:05:20.460> that<00:05:20.789> that's<00:05:21.030> where<00:05:21.270> it<00:05:21.389> comes<00:05:21.659> from

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
knowing that that's where it comes from

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.159 
knowing that that's where it comes from
you<00:05:22.409> miss<00:05:22.740> the<00:05:22.949> kind<00:05:23.190> of<00:05:23.599> foundational<00:05:24.599> issue

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
you miss the kind of foundational issue

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:29.600 
you miss the kind of foundational issue
that<00:05:25.860> underlies<00:05:26.069> the<00:05:26.669> whole<00:05:26.940> play<00:05:27.949> so<00:05:28.949> that's

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
that underlies the whole play so that's

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.279 
that underlies the whole play so that's
the<00:05:29.879> reason<00:05:30.060> that<00:05:30.360> I've<00:05:30.479> been<00:05:30.659> writing<00:05:30.930> this

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:31.289 
the reason that I've been writing this

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:32.870 
the reason that I've been writing this
stuff<00:05:31.620> so<00:05:31.740> it's<00:05:31.860> been<00:05:31.979> a<00:05:32.009> bit<00:05:32.159> of<00:05:32.250> a<00:05:32.310> sideways

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
stuff so it's been a bit of a sideways

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.820 
stuff so it's been a bit of a sideways
look<00:05:33.150> at<00:05:33.270> the<00:05:33.360> Bible<00:05:33.690> a<00:05:33.750> non-religious<00:05:34.530> look

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
look at the Bible a non-religious look

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.309 
look at the Bible a non-religious look
and<00:05:35.190> I've<00:05:35.849> actually<00:05:36.419> personally<00:05:36.780> been

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:37.319 
and I've actually personally been

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:39.399 
and I've actually personally been
surprised<00:05:37.770> that<00:05:38.069> even<00:05:38.250> more<00:05:38.759> than<00:05:39.000> I<00:05:39.090> thought

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:39.409 
surprised that even more than I thought

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:42.200 
surprised that even more than I thought
