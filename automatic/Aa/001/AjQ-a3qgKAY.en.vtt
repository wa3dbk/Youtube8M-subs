00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello girls welcome back with a new one 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.309
 video a new video really because today 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.660
 I want to start this new column 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:12.630
 let me know with a thumbs up 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.759
 if you like it practically I will talk about 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.279
 trend regarding the nails I 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.460
 I noticed that on the catwalks they turn of 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.189
 every in the absurd high I will not show 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.080
 also new trends can be said the new ones 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.380
 trend goes well apart from my doubts 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.500
 let's start immediately I'll show you 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.870
 I took pictures of models on the web 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.520
 I'm always looking for with the 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.320
 my acer keys with new trends for 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.320
 as for nails also for 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.850
 propose new tutorials on my channel 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.280
 then I choose maybe those that do 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.320
 like more eni ricreo some 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.390
 slabs not the event I absolutely the 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.489
 nono discover some techniques is true 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.910
 that I am punctually by chance though 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.030
 I don't invent it all, I look for experimentation 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.780
 in short, it changes the color of enamels, which I think is prickly 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.899
 I enjoy angel we begin immediately with the 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:08.700
 first nail art that intrigued me 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.680
 This is a manicure test on news 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.060
 enamel help I saw that anyway not 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.229
 left me news but with this one 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:20.009
 bezel next to the colored cuticle round 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:21.540
 orange salmon yes a very very launch 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.659
 clear and soft 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:29.369
 but I promote this nail art but 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:31.170
 I would propose on a different shade nodule 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.229
 on the nail news that eva phan fah 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.600
 plain to see but rather on a 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:41.520
 baby pink this nefarious can be 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.200
 realize even with a simple save 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.720
 book in what you use for 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.140
 diaries and therefore this nail art for me 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.860
 is my premise let's move on to the second one 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.829
 nail art questore the auction is very pretty 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.719
 we see that it is on a girl's hand 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.659
 of color and I really like the 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.359
 contrast at times 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:05.749
 that color really sucks on me 

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:08.780
 I'm really very tanned or of account 

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:10.610
 color is fantastic this other black 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.519
 there is also a very easy to make 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.769
 tutorials found in my previous ones 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:19.209
 video however it is a matter of downloading the 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:23.799
 brush go to recreate the effect 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:26.120
 water almost shaded water effect on 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.650
 on the nail using various shades 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.680
 of enamel therefore for the spring-summer 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.950
 a very very nice trend therefore for 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.329
 me also this is the supercross passed 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.040
 a third daylight that I liked 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:40.220
 very much also liked the model 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.950
 of the really fantastic truth these 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.780
 girls with a fantastic finger and this one 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.920
 nor in art it is easy also to be 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.500
 to achieve 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.680
 it is an elegant white chalk 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.650
 round nail take season are 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.519
 also almond and white nails 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:01.310
 chalk for is in a horizontal manner 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.950
 added one off an evening stream 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.970
 of adhesive tapes and they are those of 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.019
 they are on ideas 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.480
 quietly a euro give us 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.069
 a lot of known stripping lines e 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.019
 this year in art also easy to 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:21.709
 to realize is very very particular 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:24.200
 those between move promoted by pouring the 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:27.380
 art that intrigued me that does not make me 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:31.010
 crazy but it intrigued me and this 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:34.970
 red lacquered base perfect with 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.859
 slightly curved white lines that yes 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.609
 they cross each other recreating a species 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:43.190
 drawing effect as I did not want 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:45.950
 call this effect effect dna not 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.359
 I know however very nice and particular 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.489
 especially simple to make 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:50.350
 therefore also this of art 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.230
 promises 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.450
 let's go ahead in the other geometric 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.640
 boys astonish let's have it as we want 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:01.530
 let's take scotch and have fun 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:04.360
 we use scot tape as a form for 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.770
 make various geometric shapes on 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.170
 nails and let's have fun 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:11.980
 in this photo you can see well 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.960
 I really like the effect less 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.110
 of the geometric season on the nails 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:20.920
 also in this black white variant 

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:23.230
 news as how it was made on 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.360
 model then super pro fly too 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.450
 this nail art 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.840
 let's move on to another nail art really 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.820
 very nice too though 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.160
 the gray would fade a little more then 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.740
 what the artist has done 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.020
 with the nail artist he made a base of 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.440
 news that you notice a lot about this 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.990
 darker hand and then on the tip of the 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.360
 nails instead of an arrow is gone 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.670
 simply to blend the gray does not suit me 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.180
 drives us crazy but we also promote that 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:57.220
 it left me the last one 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.590
 trend that left me speechless 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.660
 because I do not know 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.160
 then married to really read there 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.110
 been models that they marched with 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.520
 this nail art 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.900
 but it is not easy to realize enough 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.960
 take a pact a wadding fund 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.450
 wad flock of cotton wool 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.340
 and when we need to remove the enamel it 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.830
 we remove a little lower than the cuticle 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.890
 this is the trend I make absurd 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:23.470
 see the photo because it is not me 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:27.480
 therefore like this super rejected 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:31.030
 absolutely rejected because really 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:33.940
 makes goods of the first of seems does not give the 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:36.880
 not in the sense of taking care of hand care and 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:39.970
 ugly ugly to see absolutely 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.560
 latest nail art and then I trust make you 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.650
 This washing of the brains of deny 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.710
 so stupid last in art 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.810
 is the thin French super thin if from 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.180
 spread the monochrome one shade 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:55.420
 maybe darker and the stress we go 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.849
 to do tracing just must be 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.909
 one 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:59.809
 insults that are two millimeters but not 

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:01.909
 more 

00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:04.069
 I like it I like the truth I found it 

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:07.159
 it's really very very pretty and elegant 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:09.349
 so for me this scum from chen is 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:11.509
 only the previous one of nail art 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:15.349
 these were all the news as far as 

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:16.909
 regards the world a driveway put a 

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:19.219
 thumb up if you like this genre 

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:22.099
 of videos so that maybe with cadence 

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:26.569
 maybe for every season I do the trend 

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:28.699
 horror for nails and leave it 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:32.199
 in the comments which nail art you liked 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:35.240
 more and I refer you to the next video 

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:36.409
 hello welcome back to everyone i already have a 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.249
 chalk in hand 

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:42.289
 today the wise man will draw the mead 

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:44.539
