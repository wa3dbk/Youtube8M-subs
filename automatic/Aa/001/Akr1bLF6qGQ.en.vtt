00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
and I'm going to see if I can free it up

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.500 

well<00:01:05.830> as<00:01:06.130> is<00:01:06.340> usually<00:01:06.760> the<00:01:06.790> case<00:01:06.909> I<00:01:07.360> had

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
technical difficulties and I thought the

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:11.910 
technical difficulties and I thought the
camera<00:01:10.450> was<00:01:10.600> recording<00:01:10.810> but<00:01:11.290> it<00:01:11.380> actually<00:01:11.560> was

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
camera was recording but it actually was

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.140 
camera was recording but it actually was
not<00:01:12.130> so<00:01:12.550> I<00:01:12.580> missed<00:01:13.000> out<00:01:13.210> on<00:01:13.560> recording<00:01:14.560> the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
not so I missed out on recording the

not so I missed out on recording the
fabulous<00:01:16.150> and<00:01:16.680> exciting<00:01:17.680> mixing<00:01:18.100> action

fabulous and exciting mixing action

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.540 
fabulous and exciting mixing action
however<00:01:19.270> I<00:01:19.830> have<00:01:22.470> relatively<00:01:23.470> equal<00:01:23.920> parts<00:01:24.340> of

in<00:01:27.310> this<00:01:28.980> pepper<00:01:29.980> jar<00:01:30.660> and<00:01:32.520> we<00:01:33.520> can<00:01:33.700> see

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
in this pepper jar and we can see

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.210 
in this pepper jar and we can see
already<00:01:34.120> in<00:01:34.540> here<00:01:34.780> for<00:01:35.590> some<00:01:35.740> reason<00:01:36.040> it's<00:01:36.160> not

already in here for some reason it's not
mixing<00:01:36.700> up<00:01:36.850> real<00:01:37.060> well<00:01:37.240> you<00:01:37.300> can<00:01:37.540> see<00:01:37.750> that

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
mixing up real well you can see that

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.430 
mixing up real well you can see that
separating<00:01:39.160> the<00:01:39.340> acetone<00:01:40.180> from<00:01:40.420> the<00:01:40.600> ATF<00:01:41.230> and

separating the acetone from the ATF and

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.630 
separating the acetone from the ATF and
it's<00:01:41.590> not<00:01:41.770> mixing<00:01:42.310> very<00:01:42.520> well<00:01:42.930> what<00:01:43.930> I<00:01:43.960> do<00:01:44.080> see

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
it's not mixing very well what I do see

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.330 
it's not mixing very well what I do see
pieces<00:01:45.640> of<00:01:45.990> debris<00:01:46.990> in<00:01:47.530> here<00:01:47.560> like<00:01:48.010> it<00:01:48.190> is

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
pieces of debris in here like it is

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.360 
pieces of debris in here like it is
having<00:01:48.610> an<00:01:48.850> effect<00:01:49.210> on<00:01:49.480> the<00:01:49.950> players<00:01:50.950> already

the<00:02:10.899> next<00:02:11.200> day<00:02:11.379> it's<00:02:11.680> been<00:02:11.920> not<00:02:12.280> quite<00:02:13.060> 24

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:13.659

the next day it's been not quite 24
hours

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
hours

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.699 
hours
but<00:02:15.470> we'll<00:02:16.190> see<00:02:16.519> what<00:02:16.550> we<00:02:16.790> got<00:02:17.030> there<00:02:17.650> see<00:02:18.650> if

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
but we'll see what we got there see if

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:28.930 
but we'll see what we got there see if
the<00:02:19.480> ATF<00:02:20.480> and<00:02:20.660> acetone<00:02:23.410> did<00:02:24.410> its<00:02:24.590> magic

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:42.760 

and<00:02:29.680> still<00:02:30.680> looks<00:02:30.950> pretty<00:02:31.630> cruddy<00:02:34.120> okay<00:02:41.770> well

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
and still looks pretty cruddy okay well

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.980 
and still looks pretty cruddy okay well
it's<00:02:43.010> not<00:02:43.190> free<00:02:43.580> enough<00:02:43.910> certainly<00:02:44.690> that<00:02:44.870> I

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
it's not free enough certainly that I

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.310 
it's not free enough certainly that I
can<00:02:46.030> turn<00:02:47.030> it<00:02:47.150> by<00:02:47.300> hand<00:02:47.600> yet<00:02:47.930> although<00:02:48.110> what

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
can turn it by hand yet although what

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.730 
can turn it by hand yet although what
does<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:49.010> threads<00:02:49.340> do<00:02:49.580> look<00:02:49.850> a<00:02:49.970> little

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
does the threads do look a little

00:02:50.740 --> 00:03:03.580 
does the threads do look a little
cleaner<00:02:52.480> let's<00:02:53.480> see<00:02:53.720> if<00:02:53.840> I<00:02:53.960> put<00:02:54.580> tension<00:03:02.590> all

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
cleaner let's see if I put tension all

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.220 
cleaner let's see if I put tension all
right<00:03:03.800> I'm<00:03:03.950> still<00:03:04.220> not<00:03:04.370> able<00:03:04.580> to<00:03:05.020> break<00:03:06.020> it

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
right I'm still not able to break it

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:17.580 
right I'm still not able to break it
loose<00:03:12.880> all<00:03:13.880> right

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
piece here is stuck the screw I was

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.219 
piece here is stuck the screw I was
going<00:04:19.450> to<00:04:19.570> try<00:04:20.070> put<00:04:21.070> a<00:04:21.100> little<00:04:21.250> more<00:04:21.960> force<00:04:22.960> on

the screw mechanism and see if I can

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:30.890 
the screw mechanism and see if I can
break<00:04:25.630> it<00:04:25.840> loose<00:04:26.020> oh<00:04:27.540> it<00:04:28.540> did<00:04:28.780> it<00:04:28.960> did<00:04:29.140> turn<00:04:29.380> I

it I got like a quarter turn out of this
screw<00:04:53.099> mechanism<00:04:53.340> and<00:04:53.940> that<00:04:53.970> was<00:04:54.180> about<00:04:54.270> it<00:04:55.970> so

00:04:58.149 --> 00:04:58.159 
screw mechanism and that was about it so

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:59.570

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
don't know if I put it in there for a

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.439 
don't know if I put it in there for a
year<00:05:15.889> maybe<00:05:16.889> it<00:05:17.069> would<00:05:17.270> actually<00:05:18.270> come<00:05:18.419> back

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:18.449 
year maybe it would actually come back

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:22.850 
year maybe it would actually come back
to<00:05:18.659> life<00:05:18.990> but<00:05:21.110> I'll<00:05:22.110> see<00:05:22.319> what<00:05:22.349> I<00:05:22.500> want<00:05:22.650> to<00:05:22.740> do

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
to life but I'll see what I want to do

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.529 
to life but I'll see what I want to do
maybe<00:05:23.220> I'll<00:05:23.370> put<00:05:23.550> it<00:05:23.639> back<00:05:23.789> in<00:05:24.030> there<00:05:24.210> some

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:24.539 
maybe I'll put it back in there some

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:26.120 
maybe I'll put it back in there some
more<00:05:24.720> and<00:05:25.050> try<00:05:25.500> it<00:05:25.560> again

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
more and try it again

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.450 
more and try it again
another<00:05:26.849> couple<00:05:27.449> days<00:05:27.479> and<00:05:28.130> we'll<00:05:29.130> see<00:05:29.310> what

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
another couple days and we'll see what

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.279 
another couple days and we'll see what
happens

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:30.289
