just look it up or something whore oh
I'll<00:03:15.780> put<00:03:15.959> it<00:03:16.049> in<00:03:16.109> the<00:03:16.260> description<00:03:16.409> or

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:16.949 
I'll put it in the description or

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:21.319 
I'll put it in the description or
something<00:03:17.729> like<00:03:17.849> that<00:03:18.259> anyway<00:03:19.790> so<00:03:20.790> yeah<00:03:21.030> yeah

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
something like that anyway so yeah yeah

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.479 
something like that anyway so yeah yeah
that<00:03:21.479> happens<00:03:21.870> but<00:03:22.290> this<00:03:22.889> doesn't<00:03:23.220> affect

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
that happens but this doesn't affect

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.170 
that happens but this doesn't affect
spiders<00:03:24.209> or<00:03:25.189> maybe<00:03:26.189> pigs<00:03:26.519> actually<00:03:26.909> I<00:03:26.939> don't

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
spiders or maybe pigs actually I don't

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.089 
spiders or maybe pigs actually I don't
think<00:03:27.329> this<00:03:27.389> affects<00:03:27.870> spiders<00:03:28.500> pigs<00:03:28.799> and

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
think this affects spiders pigs and

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.990 
think this affects spiders pigs and
chickens<00:03:29.129> because<00:03:30.090> they<00:03:30.389> are<00:03:30.509> too<00:03:30.750> small<00:03:32.000> when

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
chickens because they are too small when

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.749 
chickens because they are too small when
cows<00:03:33.419> and<00:03:33.810> other<00:03:33.989> things<00:03:34.259> like<00:03:34.409> that<00:03:34.620> are<00:03:34.919> big

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:35.759 
cows and other things like that are big

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:37.069 
cows and other things like that are big
enough<00:03:35.849> to<00:03:36.000> get<00:03:36.180> killed<00:03:36.359> by<00:03:36.479> the<00:03:36.540> lava<00:03:36.810> but

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
enough to get killed by the lava but

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.289 
enough to get killed by the lava but
anyway<00:03:37.319> yeah<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.949> spiders<00:03:38.400> pigs<00:03:38.970> and

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
anyway yeah the spiders pigs and

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.460 
anyway yeah the spiders pigs and
chickens<00:03:39.470> go<00:03:40.470> underneath<00:03:40.979> there<00:03:42.019> where<00:03:43.019> if<00:03:43.229> I
