00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.590
 good to all you are to castrated and in the day 

00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:08.440
 Today I am going to present you a very 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.299
 simple but that really is addictive 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.009
 and on the other hand I'm going to do a little 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:12.969
 comment on this launcher that 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:16.150
 I suppose many of you 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:18.430
 you will know they have made several video medias 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.570
 reviews and well it is a channel 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:24.289
 quite known as sandro for all 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.730
 which arrived because I admire but really 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:30.360
 and well I just wanted to make a little 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.279
 point because I've seen in forums because 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.829
 there are many people, someone, the code 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.850
 of activation and such and well then I'm going to 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.550
 do a little a little clarification 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.559
 now if you call and serve 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.530
 also tell you then I've been a little 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.690
 absent as to how many was the video 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.559
 If I have a bit abandoned to the channel 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.809
 and well, I'm going to go back and 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.550
 As you can see, I'm going to keep going up 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.400
 videos trying to make them 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.710
 weekly as before and without any 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.760
 problem because then you can put me as 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.330
 always so your comments 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.210
 your suggestions and 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.400
 and that I hope you keep going there and that 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.070
 go grow this 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.470
 let's go to what is the game is the hanger 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.620
 the best you know is a game 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.450
 really simple but that is the 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:25.280
 mechanics is very addictive we have a 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.350
 bird that is changing the color and how 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.430
 and marks us as we screen 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:36.230
 to go hitting the screen and then from 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:40.460
 this way is going to jump the air what 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:43.970
 that is our our our bird the 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:47.030
 aim to exceed the maximum of tubes 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.640
 of possible obstacles and as you see then 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.950
 we have a marker on the top 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.530
 of the screen that will tell us then 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.750
 what is our our score in 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.640
 this case score that is in English we 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.400
 our best score also comes out and 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.080
 one played a lot as you see my best 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.720
 score is 9 and well then also 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.700
 you can compare results with friends and 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.550
 so good the truth is that it seems very 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.750
 simple but 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.750
 it was very good 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.580
 On the other hand tell you about the good and 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.020
 to finish telling you the theme of this 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.330
 launcher that seems like a night to me 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.730
 really extraordinary that offers them 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.700
 well enough functionalities 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.280
 novelties and also the theme 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.340
 aesthetic because it is also 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.770
 it is quite quite different from what is already 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.230
 seen I'm not going to do a review of what 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.420
 which is simply because I wanted to give you a 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.760
 small a little trick to see if 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.530
 it works I've gotten into various forums 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.910
 good been reading a little about the 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.200
 activation code because they help and what 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:54.800
 I wanted to try and I saw that putting the 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.690
 yahoo word because it is created by 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.140
 yahoo is created by yahoo east of this one 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:03.080
 launcher could activate it provides no 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.709
 It did not work for me because I was already 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:09.530
 well I read that he had already fulfilled the 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:13.489
 limit is that code I also found 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:16.010
 some more code and it did not work either and 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.620
 well, I also read in another one in another 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.720
 page that there were people then that 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.209
 he put his code and such but that was a 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:27.230
 little as expected, we 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:29.680
 I served then I thought good so 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:33.140
 if they follow this pattern so to speak 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:37.489
 So what I did was keep a couple of 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:39.140
 digits and go combining others and good 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.200
 well, testing the one that promises his four 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.760
 Sometimes, look where I went, I've 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.890
 recommended a friend also and 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.040
 it also worked for you so I'm going 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:52.750
 to leave the pattern here so that 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:57.379
 so that you see it and go testing it is or 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:04:00.620
 there is forgiveness 0 b in capital letters everything always 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:03.739
 and three digits three digits for example 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:08.120
 2 77 that is the last one that I tried and I 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:12.049
 and it worked for me , you are testing 0 see and three 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.090
 digits and I guess so what that 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:15.859
 some work I hope I have been 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.350
 help because I've seen so much 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:19.910
 people asked him and he was a 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.829
 little desperate because I wanted to try the 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.410
 launcher already know that it is a version 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:27.020
 beta and until the version is released 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:30.760
 Finally you can not try it without 5 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.760
 I say until next time
