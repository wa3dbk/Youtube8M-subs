 Hello, welcome to the vector 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:08.800
 guide rock number 25 how to quickly change 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.510
 the color of the object my name is Dmitry tregub

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.160
 the most recent rocky in vector graphics 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.140
 lessons are completely free but 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.640
 I will be very grateful if you do not 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.439
 will click on the skip button 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.660
 advertising the beginning of the lesson 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.300
 so you can say on 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.550
 thanks and kindly requested not 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.590
 use the pictures you draw from 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.179
 lessons for sale on drains as this 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.529
 may entail gross violation 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:35.140
 copyright 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:43.780
 subsequent removal from micro drain and 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:47.020
 so if you are ready let's start in this 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.840
 lesson we will analyze such a moment as 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.210
 quickly repaint some object well 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.730
 let's say we have some kind of button 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:01:00.190
 the usual button which is used on 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:05.049
 sites let's say red on but 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:08.560
 Now I will quickly create and I will show 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:10.990
 how we quickly repainted the colors we have 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:16.509
 we want to create some kind of 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:20.680
 collection up from different colors well let's 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:29.860
 create some kind of ordinary this round 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:31.470
 such as a button here so that's worked out for 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.229
 us a button 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:39.430
 puree back to the topic of our lesson for 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:47.250
 order to make a whole collection of such 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:50.439
 here are the buttons of different colors, we first 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.799
 we need to copy the quantity well 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:58.290
 let's say how to make 9 pieces for 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.290
 let's make such a 3 by 3 matrix 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:17.850
 photo group we select all the objects of cheese 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.670
 feasting and centering then again 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:24.720
 played 1 this so that it could be later 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.750
 choose separately and now by 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.180
 queues will choose and change tons 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:34.260
 each button to change 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:37.890
 tone or color of each color 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.900
 buttons we go such a tool which 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.180
 called repaint graphic 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.720
 the object appears in the event that 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:49.430
 we choose the objects we want 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:53.610
 repaint is he here here here 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.980
 toolbar toolbar and top 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.500
 tools called repaint 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.730
 graphic object it looks like this 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.770
 circle to such sectors here 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:09.180
 click on it and get it here 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:11.220
 window here a lot of options 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.090
 maybe later I will do a separate lesson where 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.110
 we will analyze separately in detail 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.300
 every parameter 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.240
 but now I will quickly show how fast 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:24.240
 change color here are two buttons 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:27.510
 edit and assign now actively 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:30.510
 assign we proceed where we 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.240
 edit us here appears 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.090
 the color wheel and it divided me into 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.270
 sector 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.440
 because I'm active now 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:44.490
 mount the color wheel ie we 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:47.480
 disassemble if we don't want 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:51.470
 how to accurately set some segment 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:54.200
 then we can return but this from the usual 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.520
 Here it is inconvenient and use 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.720
 segmented 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:04.500
 here to change the color of the object 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:07.620
 we have to press a button to create 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:13.550
 links to organic colors that is, we 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:18.799
 how to block our current color 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.799
 let's move this marker 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.600
 Here we moved to such a pink 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.830
 on 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.990
 and it turned out that all the objects of this 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:36.820
 buttons that we are changing now 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:40.480
 they have changed their color tone so 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:43.240
 way we can change the color tone for 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:49.140
 each object of this in turn 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:51.850
 we choose and do not forget me 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:58.770
 establishes harmonic references 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:05:01.600
 colors choose object again promising 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:07.650
 repaint the graphic object go 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:11.919
 on edit click this button and 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:15.580
 You can see that this marker is moving 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:17.919
 we don't need this one 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:22.060
 change it because it will change 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:28.290
 color saturation from leave later 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:31.290
 circles where he was just changing 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.290
 sector 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:24.180
 that's the way we were able to quickly 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:29.200
 create such a collection 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:32.140
 such buttons of different colors you 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.240
 watched lesson number 25 how fast 

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.740
 change the color of the object with you was Dmitry
