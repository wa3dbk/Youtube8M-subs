00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
hey guys this is George and I'm zoom

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:04.880 
hey guys this is George and I'm zoom
doing<00:00:03.210> a<00:00:03.330> review<00:00:03.689> of<00:00:03.750> an<00:00:03.959> app<00:00:04.110> called<00:00:04.380> timers

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
doing a review of an app called timers

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.039 
doing a review of an app called timers
and<00:00:05.040> stopwatch<00:00:05.279> so<00:00:06.210> this<00:00:06.450> app<00:00:06.629> is<00:00:06.839> very

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
and stopwatch so this app is very

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.709 
and stopwatch so this app is very
similar<00:00:07.319> to<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:07.919> multi<00:00:08.580> measure<00:00:08.790> of<00:00:08.970> HD<00:00:09.450> app

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
similar to the multi measure of HD app

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.839 
similar to the multi measure of HD app
which<00:00:09.990> I<00:00:10.139> revealed<00:00:10.410> recently<00:00:10.740> it's<00:00:11.460> from<00:00:11.759> the

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
which I revealed recently it's from the

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.959 
which I revealed recently it's from the
same<00:00:12.000> developer<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:13.370> apart<00:00:14.370> from<00:00:14.429> that<00:00:14.759> app

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
same developer and apart from that app

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.510 
same developer and apart from that app
the<00:00:15.330> only<00:00:15.360> difference<00:00:15.900> is<00:00:16.049> that<00:00:16.080> it<00:00:16.740> only<00:00:17.220> has

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
the only difference is that it only has

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.570 
the only difference is that it only has
two<00:00:17.880> utilities<00:00:18.480> so<00:00:18.869> multi<00:00:19.560> measures<00:00:19.890> HD<00:00:20.340> had

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
two utilities so multi measures HD had

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.910 
two utilities so multi measures HD had
eight<00:00:20.910> utilities<00:00:21.660> this<00:00:22.140> one<00:00:22.320> only<00:00:22.439> has<00:00:22.560> the

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
eight utilities this one only has the

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.340 
eight utilities this one only has the
timers<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.699> stopwatch<00:00:23.939> acidities<00:00:24.660> but

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
timers and the stopwatch acidities but

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.620 
timers and the stopwatch acidities but
it<00:00:25.560> also<00:00:25.740> allows<00:00:26.519> you<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.730> use<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.359> on<00:00:27.480> your

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
it also allows you to use it on your

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.870 
it also allows you to use it on your
iPhone<00:00:28.019> or<00:00:28.289> iPod<00:00:28.619> Touch<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:29.130> it's<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.340> universal

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
iPhone or iPod Touch so it's a universal

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.389 
iPhone or iPod Touch so it's a universal
app<00:00:30.029> not<00:00:30.570> like<00:00:30.840> multi<00:00:31.260> measure<00:00:31.410> HD<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:32.250> it

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
app not like multi measure HD that it

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.060 
app not like multi measure HD that it
costs<00:00:32.790> one<00:00:32.969> dollar<00:00:33.000> less<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:33.989> total<00:00:34.829> price<00:00:35.040> of

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
costs one dollar less so total price of

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.190 
costs one dollar less so total price of
one<00:00:35.460> butter<00:00:35.700> on<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.450> App<00:00:36.570> Store<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:36.960> I'll<00:00:37.050> put

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
one butter on the App Store and I'll put

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.330 
one butter on the App Store and I'll put

we can email the times so right here you
can<00:02:35.489> see<00:02:35.549> it's<00:02:35.790> very<00:02:36.030> simple<00:02:36.450> since<00:02:36.720> I<00:02:36.870> don't

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
can see it's very simple since I don't

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.080 
can see it's very simple since I don't
have<00:02:37.140> any<00:02:38.660> and<00:02:39.660> any<00:02:39.930> split<00:02:40.799> any<00:02:41.459> splits<00:02:41.849> right

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
here but if I go like this and I start

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.080 
here but if I go like this and I start
splitting<00:02:45.209> I<00:02:45.510> can<00:02:46.470> press<00:02:46.799> right<00:02:47.040> here<00:02:47.069> and<00:02:47.880> you

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
can see it shows you the times and you

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.069 
can see it shows you the times and you
can<00:02:49.590> send<00:02:49.799> it<00:02:49.890> so<00:02:50.040> ever<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.370> whatever<00:02:51.329> needs
