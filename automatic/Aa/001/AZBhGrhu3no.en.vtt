that out you can download it for free
basically<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.610> way<00:00:35.700> this<00:00:35.850> works<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.469> use

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
basically the way this works is you use

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.220 
basically the way this works is you use
OBS<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.040> if<00:00:38.400> you<00:00:38.610> don't<00:00:38.970> use<00:00:39.120> OBS<00:00:39.570> you're

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
OBS and if you don't use OBS you're

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.630 
OBS and if you don't use OBS you're
probably<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.980> know<00:00:41.070> you<00:00:41.340> don't<00:00:41.430> have<00:00:41.520> the

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
probably you know you don't have the

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.420 
probably you know you don't have the
best<00:00:41.820> quality<00:00:42.120> stream<00:00:42.780> I'm<00:00:42.990> sure<00:00:43.250> unless<00:00:44.250> you

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
best quality stream I'm sure unless you

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.890 
best quality stream I'm sure unless you
pay<00:00:44.610> for<00:00:44.670> xsplit<00:00:45.300> those<00:00:45.450> are<00:00:45.570> probably<00:00:45.750> the

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:45.900 
pay for xsplit those are probably the

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.990 
pay for xsplit those are probably the
two<00:00:45.990> best<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.470> use<00:00:46.680> OBS<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.340> free<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:47.880> I<00:00:47.940> do

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
two best to use OBS is free and I do

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.940
