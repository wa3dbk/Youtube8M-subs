00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
teeth that those teeth are definitely

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.330 
teeth that those teeth are definitely
capped<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.200> it's<00:00:40.320> probably<00:00:40.649> because<00:00:40.890> batman

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
capped and it's probably because batman

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.860 
capped and it's probably because batman
punched<00:00:41.850> his<00:00:41.969> teeth<00:00:42.180> out<00:00:42.329> once<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.719> that's

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
punched his teeth out once and that's

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.170 
punched his teeth out once and that's
really<00:00:43.200> cool<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:44.160> fact<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.430> he's<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:44.820> shape

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
i think is really cool that means he

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.799 
i think is really cool that means he
could<00:00:46.920> get<00:00:47.250> beat<00:00:47.489> up<00:00:47.520> by<00:00:47.820> Batman<00:00:48.390> more<00:00:48.629> to
