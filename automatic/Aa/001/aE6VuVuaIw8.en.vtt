00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.390 
doing any other action a touch I don't
know<00:02:16.410> how<00:02:16.530> much<00:02:16.650> it<00:02:16.800> matters<00:02:16.890> at<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.220> end<00:02:17.280> of

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
know how much it matters at the end of

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.880 
know how much it matters at the end of
the<00:02:17.460> day<00:02:17.610> but<00:02:20.810> given<00:02:21.810> that<00:02:21.840> Montana<00:02:22.530> has<00:02:22.680> down

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
the day but given that Montana has down

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.950 
the day but given that Montana has down
to<00:02:23.220> just<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.270> Boone<00:02:24.480> center<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:24.900> the

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
to just the Boone center and the

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.360 
to just the Boone center and the
experiment<00:02:25.410> one<00:02:25.500> I<00:02:25.530> would<00:02:25.770> be<00:02:25.890> surprised<00:02:26.190> to

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
experiment one I would be surprised to

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.490 
experiment one I would be surprised to
see<00:02:26.400> her<00:02:26.700> chump<00:02:27.030> block<00:02:27.240> here<00:02:27.480> I<00:02:27.630> had<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:27.870> it's

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
see her chump block here I had to it's

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.790 
see her chump block here I had to it's
gonna<00:02:28.620> let<00:02:28.800> it<00:02:28.890> go<00:02:29.010> which<00:02:29.340> i<00:02:29.430> think<00:02:29.460> is<00:02:29.670> correct

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
gonna let it go which i think is correct

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.400 
gonna let it go which i think is correct
here's<00:02:31.800> three<00:02:32.040> mana<00:02:32.959> that's<00:02:33.959> a<00:02:34.080> banishing

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
here's three mana that's a banishing

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.510 
here's three mana that's a banishing
line<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.740> get<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:34.920> votes<00:02:35.100> hitter<00:02:35.250> off<00:02:35.400> the

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
line to get the votes hitter off the

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.590 
line to get the votes hitter off the
table

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.740 

alright<00:02:39.290> a<00:02:39.850> quick<00:02:40.850> on<00:02:40.970> tap<00:02:41.180> into<00:02:41.330> trial<00:02:41.540> cheese

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
alright a quick on tap into trial cheese

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.530 
alright a quick on tap into trial cheese
yeah<00:02:44.320> and<00:02:44.590> it<00:02:44.650> looks<00:02:44.680> like<00:02:45.150> Montana<00:02:46.150> down<00:02:46.390> to

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
yeah and it looks like Montana down to

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.060 
yeah and it looks like Montana down to
just<00:02:46.690> a<00:02:46.810> landed<00:02:47.110> hand<00:02:47.290> plus<00:02:47.410> these<00:02:47.590> experiment

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
just a landed hand plus these experiment

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.940 
just a landed hand plus these experiment
ones<00:02:49.200> now<00:02:50.200> one<00:02:50.350> thing<00:02:50.380> we<00:02:50.530> know<00:02:50.650> about<00:02:50.680> green

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
ones now one thing we know about green

ones now one thing we know about green
white<00:02:51.100> as<00:02:51.190> it<00:02:51.280> can<00:02:51.400> close<00:02:51.580> the<00:02:51.730> game<00:02:51.850> out<00:02:51.970> very

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
white as it can close the game out very

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.640 
white as it can close the game out very

tactics you know I don't think this is a

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.300 
tactics you know I don't think this is a

so<00:03:12.040> slim<00:03:12.580> to<00:03:12.790> me<00:03:12.910> that<00:03:13.540> I<00:03:13.570> wouldn't<00:03:13.840> even<00:03:13.900> try

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
so slim to me that I wouldn't even try

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.320 
so slim to me that I wouldn't even try
to<00:03:14.110> play<00:03:14.350> around<00:03:14.530> it<00:03:14.740> also<00:03:15.280> very<00:03:16.030> unlikely

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
to play around it also very unlikely

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.390 
to play around it also very unlikely
that<00:03:16.420> I<00:03:16.570> events<00:03:16.900> there<00:03:17.140> because<00:03:17.560> you<00:03:18.220> know<00:03:18.340> you

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
that I events there because you know you

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.740 
that I events there because you know you
can<00:03:18.550> be<00:03:18.640> pretty<00:03:18.820> confident<00:03:19.270> that<00:03:19.300> Montana

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
can be pretty confident that Montana

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.120 
can be pretty confident that Montana
drew<00:03:19.930> experiment<00:03:20.380> one<00:03:20.500> cuz<00:03:20.770> you<00:03:20.860> could<00:03:20.980> just

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
drew experiment one cuz you could just

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.390 
drew experiment one cuz you could just
cast<00:03:21.340> at<00:03:21.550> last<00:03:21.730> turn<00:03:22.000> and<00:03:23.040> most<00:03:24.040> likely<00:03:24.160> it

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
cast at last turn and most likely it

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.740 
cast at last turn and most likely it
would've<00:03:24.550> been<00:03:24.610> worth<00:03:24.790> deploying<00:03:25.270> a<00:03:25.540> bent

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
would've been worth deploying a bent

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:26.820 
would've been worth deploying a bent
over<00:03:25.959> whatever<00:03:26.170> she<00:03:26.470> did<00:03:26.560> on<00:03:26.709> the<00:03:26.739> previous

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
over whatever she did on the previous

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.420 
over whatever she did on the previous
turn<00:03:27.370> so<00:03:28.230> there's<00:03:29.230> an<00:03:29.350> attack<00:03:29.590> for<00:03:29.770> three<00:03:30.070> just

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
turn so there's an attack for three just

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.100 
turn so there's an attack for three just
passed<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:30.730> turn<00:03:30.880> back<00:03:31.120> the<00:03:31.959> voice

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
passed the turn back the voice

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.680 
passed the turn back the voice
resurgence<00:03:32.680> is<00:03:32.830> the<00:03:32.950> draw<00:03:33.330> that's<00:03:34.330> gonna<00:03:34.480> come

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
resurgence is the draw that's gonna come

Chokin doesn't give it their sister
testing<00:03:48.299> tactics<00:03:50.930> so<00:03:51.930> that<00:03:52.079> resolves<00:03:52.650> but<00:03:52.859> Tim

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
testing tactics so that resolves but Tim

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.229 
testing tactics so that resolves but Tim
doesn't<00:03:53.189> have<00:03:53.340> to<00:03:53.430> fight<00:03:53.609> right<00:03:53.760> away<00:03:54.000> yeah

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
doesn't have to fight right away yeah

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.270 
doesn't have to fight right away yeah
geeky<00:03:54.840> leave<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.349> police<00:03:55.530> made<00:03:55.709> on<00:03:55.890> defense

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
geeky leave the police made on defense

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:03.020 
geeky leave the police made on defense
but<00:03:56.870> he<00:03:58.250> fights<00:03:59.480> now<00:04:00.480> I<00:04:00.510> think<00:04:01.790> it's<00:04:02.790> cuz

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
but he fights now I think it's cuz

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.399 
but he fights now I think it's cuz
because<00:04:03.329> there<00:04:03.480> are<00:04:03.599> evolve<00:04:03.959> triggers<00:04:04.230> on<00:04:04.349> the

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:04.409 
because there are evolve triggers on the

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:09.319 
because there are evolve triggers on the
staff<00:04:06.379> and<00:04:07.379> so<00:04:07.819> Mason<00:04:08.819> will<00:04:08.849> take<00:04:09.030> a<00:04:09.060> look<00:04:09.239> at

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
staff and so Mason will take a look at

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:10.910 
staff and so Mason will take a look at
stem<00:04:09.540> tactics<00:04:09.959> knows<00:04:10.139> exactly<00:04:10.379> how<00:04:10.620> it<00:04:10.739> works

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
stem tactics knows exactly how it works

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.520 
stem tactics knows exactly how it works
and<00:04:11.189> now<00:04:11.340> here<00:04:11.549> are<00:04:11.639> the<00:04:11.670> evolved<00:04:11.969> triggers<00:04:12.530> so

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
and now here are the evolved triggers so

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:21.229 
and now here are the evolved triggers so
experiment<00:04:13.829> ones<00:04:14.010> are<00:04:14.159> now<00:04:14.280> experiment<00:04:14.879> tues

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.089

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
know get something let's get a creature

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.680 
know get something let's get a creature
off<00:05:00.610> against<00:05:00.880> board<00:05:01.120> but<00:05:01.210> I<00:05:01.240> don't<00:05:01.450> love<00:05:01.540> the

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
off against board but I don't love the

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.660 
off against board but I don't love the
exchange<00:05:02.050> well<00:05:02.980> the<00:05:03.070> exchange<00:05:03.340> might<00:05:03.550> be

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:03.670 
exchange well the exchange might be

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.370 
exchange well the exchange might be
valuable<00:05:03.790> here<00:05:04.330> because<00:05:04.630> I<00:05:04.810> think<00:05:04.930> Montana

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
valuable here because I think Montana

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.410 
valuable here because I think Montana
isn't<00:05:05.710> a<00:05:05.770> spot<00:05:05.980> where<00:05:06.160> she's<00:05:06.430> just<00:05:06.460> drawing<00:05:07.180> to

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:07.420 
isn't a spot where she's just drawing to

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:12.360 
isn't a spot where she's just drawing to
a<00:05:08.010> Johnny<00:05:09.010> at<00:05:09.280> this<00:05:09.460> point<00:05:09.700> anyway<00:05:10.290> so<00:05:11.370> you're

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
a Johnny at this point anyway so you're

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:13.650 
a Johnny at this point anyway so you're
to<00:05:12.550> experiment<00:05:13.000> ones<00:05:13.120> are<00:05:13.270> probably<00:05:13.390> worth

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
to experiment ones are probably worth

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.470 
to experiment ones are probably worth
less<00:05:13.960> than<00:05:14.580> the<00:05:15.580> one<00:05:15.760> Feliz<00:05:16.000> pain<00:05:16.180> although<00:05:16.450> I

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480 
less than the one Feliz pain although I

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.370 
less than the one Feliz pain although I
guess<00:05:16.690> they're<00:05:16.870> they're<00:05:17.080> still<00:05:17.320> pretty

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
guess they're they're still pretty

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.260 
guess they're they're still pretty
valuable<00:05:17.740> for<00:05:18.340> for<00:05:18.820> the<00:05:18.880> purposes<00:05:19.210> of

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
valuable for for the purposes of

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.500 
valuable for for the purposes of
blockings<00:05:19.780> yeah<00:05:19.990> maybe<00:05:20.230> not<00:05:21.450> national<00:05:22.450> ID

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
blockings yeah maybe not national ID

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.120 
blockings yeah maybe not national ID
