00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
child's favorite story and so it kind of

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.680

extends<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.280> lifetime<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.940> toy<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.600> I

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
extends the lifetime of the toy and I

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.030 
extends the lifetime of the toy and I
think<00:00:36.930> at<00:00:37.050> this<00:00:37.200> age<00:00:37.410> as<00:00:37.559> well<00:00:37.590> they<00:00:37.860> get<00:00:38.010> a

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
think at this age as well they get a

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.549 
think at this age as well they get a
real<00:00:38.340> kick<00:00:38.700> from<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.809> sensation<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.350> toys

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
real kick from the sensation of toys

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.760 
real kick from the sensation of toys
responding<00:00:41.280> back<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.879> them<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.590> being<00:00:43.590> able

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
responding back to them and being able

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.160 
responding back to them and being able
to<00:00:44.040> control<00:00:44.460> what<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.850> toy<00:00:45.030> does<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.690> gives<00:00:45.989> a

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
to control what the toy does it gives a

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.220 
to control what the toy does it gives a
little<00:00:46.680> toddler<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.219> sense<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.579> power<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.600> it's

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
little toddler a sense of power so it's

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.229 
little toddler a sense of power so it's
actually<00:00:49.469> pretty<00:00:49.860> good<00:00:50.100> value<00:00:50.550> for<00:00:50.579> money<00:00:50.789> in

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
actually pretty good value for money in

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.000 
actually pretty good value for money in
that<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.719> can<00:00:51.899> update<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.289> as<00:00:52.680> your<00:00:52.860> child

the buttons do

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.930 
the buttons do
it<00:01:06.070> makes<00:01:06.760> it<00:01:07.090> for<00:01:07.390> music<00:01:07.690> and<00:01:08.580> bamboo<00:01:09.580> turns

off<00:01:10.210> that<00:01:11.080> Wilkins<00:01:11.650> night<00:01:14.070> it's<00:01:15.070> quite

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
off that Wilkins night it's quite

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.710 
off that Wilkins night it's quite
appealing<00:01:15.610> and<00:01:15.910> I<00:01:16.000> think<00:01:16.240> probably<00:01:16.390> worth

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
appealing and I think probably worth

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.050 
appealing and I think probably worth
considering<00:01:17.260> if<00:01:17.440> you've<00:01:17.590> got<00:01:17.800> a<00:01:18.010> child<00:01:18.880> who

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
considering if you've got a child who

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.150 
considering if you've got a child who
sort<00:01:19.270> of<00:01:19.300> 12<00:01:19.540> months<00:01:19.869> or<00:01:19.960> older<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:23.140> for<00:01:23.770> the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
sort of 12 months or older so for the

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.410 
sort of 12 months or older so for the
children<00:01:24.490> who<00:01:24.610> have<00:01:24.700> perhaps<00:01:24.820> a<00:01:25.030> little<00:01:25.180> bit

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
children who have perhaps a little bit

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.359 
children who have perhaps a little bit
older<00:01:25.570> this<00:01:25.930> is<00:01:26.080> really<00:01:26.320> one<00:01:26.590> of<00:01:26.619> our<00:01:26.830> best

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
older this is really one of our best

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.310 
older this is really one of our best
recommendations<00:01:28.300> which<00:01:28.509> is<00:01:28.690> the<00:01:28.840> leapfrog

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
recommendations which is the leapfrog

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.460 
recommendations which is the leapfrog
tag<00:01:29.580> there<00:01:30.580> is<00:01:30.729> a<00:01:30.759> junior<00:01:31.119> version<00:01:31.450> for<00:01:31.869> 2<00:01:32.050> plus

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
tag there is a junior version for 2 plus

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.710 
tag there is a junior version for 2 plus
but<00:01:32.830> I<00:01:32.860> kind<00:01:33.190> of<00:01:33.250> think<00:01:33.400> personally<00:01:34.150> it's<00:01:34.630> a

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
but I kind of think personally it's a

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.230 
but I kind of think personally it's a
bit<00:01:34.869> try<00:01:35.110> hard<00:01:35.460> but<00:01:36.460> when<00:01:36.610> your<00:01:36.759> child's<00:01:37.060> kind

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
bit try hard but when your child's kind

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.930 
bit try hard but when your child's kind
of<00:01:37.300> getting<00:01:37.450> to<00:01:37.630> three<00:01:37.990> or<00:01:38.229> four<00:01:38.940> basically

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
of getting to three or four basically

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.570 
of getting to three or four basically
what<00:01:40.119> you<00:01:40.210> have<00:01:40.479> is<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:41.860> have<00:01:41.890> a<00:01:42.039> pen<00:01:42.280> and<00:01:42.310> then

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
what you have is you have a pen and then

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.460 
what you have is you have a pen and then
you<00:01:42.759> get<00:01:42.910> a<00:01:42.970> story<00:01:43.390> there's<00:01:43.780> one<00:01:43.930> included

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
you get a story there's one included

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.950 
you get a story there's one included
with<00:01:44.680> the<00:01:44.860> set<00:01:45.130> and<00:01:45.550> you<00:01:45.970> can<00:01:46.180> top<00:01:46.390> up<00:01:46.570> with<00:01:46.750> new

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
with the set and you can top up with new

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.160 
with the set and you can top up with new
books<00:01:47.259> but<00:01:47.800> basically<00:01:48.190> within<00:01:48.700> each<00:01:48.970> book<00:01:49.360> it

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170
