00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
small concern so with the cutscenes you

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.260 
small concern so with the cutscenes you
cannot<00:01:52.250> exit<00:01:53.250> out<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.430> those<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.880> gotta<00:01:54.090> sit

cannot exit out of those you gotta sit
through<00:01:54.509> them<00:02:06.860> so<00:02:07.860> while<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.190> might<00:02:08.310> be<00:02:08.459> fun

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
through them so while it might be fun

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.309 
through them so while it might be fun
the<00:02:09.000> first<00:02:09.149> time<00:02:09.299> around<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:09.929> might<00:02:10.110> not

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
the first time around you might not

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.140 
the first time around you might not
always<00:02:10.560> want<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.220> sit<00:02:11.430> through<00:02:11.610> their<00:02:11.790> show

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
always want to sit through their show

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.750 
always want to sit through their show
and<00:02:13.140> able<00:02:13.560> T<00:02:13.709> to<00:02:13.739> skip<00:02:14.100> that<00:02:14.310> should<00:02:14.580> be

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
and able T to skip that should be

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.660 
and able T to skip that should be
included<00:02:15.060> I<00:02:15.690> think<00:02:16.290> but<00:02:16.799> it's<00:02:17.130> currently<00:02:17.430> not

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
included I think but it's currently not

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.770 
included I think but it's currently not
that<00:02:19.670> so<00:02:20.670> when<00:02:20.880> you<00:02:20.970> exit<00:02:21.239> out<00:02:21.330> of<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.540> castle
