however dried fruit is not as optimum as
fresh<00:02:21.900> fruit<00:02:22.489> the<00:02:23.489> reason<00:02:23.940> number<00:02:24.120> three

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
fresh fruit the reason number three

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.960 
fresh fruit the reason number three
consideration<00:02:25.379> number<00:02:25.500> three<00:02:25.950> is<00:02:26.159> that<00:02:26.519> dried

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
consideration number three is that dried

damages your teeth can damage your teeth

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.190 
damages your teeth can damage your teeth
because<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.099> sticks<00:02:32.459> to<00:02:32.700> your<00:02:32.819> teeth<00:02:32.879> and<00:02:33.450> then

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
because it sticks to your teeth and then

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.390 
because it sticks to your teeth and then
bacteria<00:02:34.980> loves<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:36.120> sugar<00:02:36.569> that<00:02:36.810> is<00:02:37.739> present

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
bacteria loves the sugar that is present

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.050 
bacteria loves the sugar that is present
in<00:02:38.519> your<00:02:38.549> mouth

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
so it starts breathing it starts

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.150 
so it starts breathing it starts
multiplying<00:02:41.549> and<00:02:41.849> bacterial<00:02:42.540> waste<00:02:42.810> then<00:02:43.769> eat

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
multiplying and bacterial waste then eat

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.509 
multiplying and bacterial waste then eat
into<00:02:44.640> your<00:02:44.910> enamel<00:02:45.540> so<00:02:46.099> maintaining<00:02:47.099> a<00:02:47.190> proper
