experienced that in this workout I had
five<00:01:01.770> by<00:01:01.949> five<00:01:02.129> at<00:01:02.370> 585<00:01:02.879> scheduled<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.629> after

five by five at 585 scheduled and after
this<00:01:04.110> first<00:01:04.379> set<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:05.129> 585<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:06.180> walked<00:01:06.780> over<00:01:07.080> to

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
this first set of 585 I walked over to

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.179 
this first set of 585 I walked over to
check<00:01:07.680> my<00:01:07.860> camera<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:09.170> I<00:01:10.170> noticed<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.040> there

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
check my camera and I noticed that there

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.520 
check my camera and I noticed that there
was<00:01:11.310> some<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.850> was<00:01:11.970> having<00:01:12.210> some<00:01:12.420> issues<00:01:12.780> with

was some I was having some issues with
some<00:01:14.280> pain<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.790> my<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.600> middle<00:01:15.840> back<00:01:16.049> around

my<00:01:16.560> rib<00:01:16.740> cage<00:01:16.770> on<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:18.240> right<00:01:18.390> side<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.990> I

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
my rib cage on the right side and I

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.010 
my rib cage on the right side and I
believe<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.520> i<00:01:20.820> may<00:01:21.060> have<00:01:21.119> dislocated<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.810> rib

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
believe that i may have dislocated a rib

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.359 
believe that i may have dislocated a rib
in<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.320> first<00:01:22.590> set<00:01:22.830> i'm<00:01:23.009> not<00:01:23.159> quite<00:01:23.340> sure

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
in that first set i'm not quite sure

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.690 
in that first set i'm not quite sure
where<00:01:24.259> maybe<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.380> combination<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:26.100> some<00:01:26.310> strain

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
where maybe a combination of some strain

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.160 
where maybe a combination of some strain
and<00:01:26.939> just<00:01:27.060> some<00:01:27.270> bad<00:01:27.479> positioning<00:01:28.020> on<00:01:28.140> the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
and just some bad positioning on the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.690 
and just some bad positioning on the
last<00:01:28.470> rep<00:01:29.450> it<00:01:30.450> was<00:01:30.600> pretty<00:01:31.170> pretty<00:01:32.100> hard<00:01:32.430> for

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
last rep it was pretty pretty hard for

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
terrible idea if I am hurts and getting

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:57.709 
terrible idea if I am hurts and getting
back<00:01:56.820> onto<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.119> bar<00:01:57.240> could<00:01:57.420> be<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.570> worst

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
back onto the bar could be the worst

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.420 
back onto the bar could be the worst
thing<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:57.960> happens<00:01:58.290> but<00:01:58.500> I'm<00:01:58.619> going<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.250> risk

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
thing that happens but I'm going to risk

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.459 
thing that happens but I'm going to risk
it<00:01:59.670> because<00:02:00.030> it's<00:02:00.390> worth<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.990> me<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.170> find

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
it because it's worth it to me to find

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.060 
it because it's worth it to me to find
out<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.540> so<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.570> got<00:02:03.930> under<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.229> bar<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.710> my

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
out and so I got under the bar and my

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.969 
out and so I got under the bar and my
second<00:02:05.430> set<00:02:05.610> felt<00:02:05.880> better<00:02:06.090> than<00:02:06.270> my<00:02:06.390> first

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
second set felt better than my first

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.499 
second set felt better than my first
regardless

side of the self-preservation and I just

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.470 
side of the self-preservation and I just
feel<00:03:17.989> like<00:03:18.109> it's<00:03:18.319> more<00:03:18.560> important<00:03:19.099> to<00:03:19.400> give<00:03:20.359> an

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
feel like it's more important to give an

feel like it's more important to give an

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:27.379 
and what the actual situation is and not

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:29.349 
and what the actual situation is and not
give<00:03:27.650> yourself<00:03:28.069> a<00:03:28.220> cheap<00:03:28.430> cop<00:03:28.669> out<00:03:28.879> because<00:03:29.239> I

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
give yourself a cheap cop out because I

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:31.839 
give yourself a cheap cop out because I
feel<00:03:29.569> like<00:03:29.599> that<00:03:29.930> happens<00:03:30.410> so<00:03:31.190> frequently<00:03:31.400> and

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:31.849 
feel like that happens so frequently and

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:33.159 
feel like that happens so frequently and
that's<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:32.180> reason<00:03:32.329> that<00:03:32.540> so<00:03:32.870> few<00:03:33.109> people

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:33.169 
that's the reason that so few people

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:40.270 
that's the reason that so few people
ever<00:03:34.930> get<00:03:35.930> to<00:03:36.379> a<00:03:36.910> really<00:03:37.910> high<00:03:38.030> level<00:03:39.280> because

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
ever get to a really high level because

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.430 
ever get to a really high level because
they<00:03:40.430> get<00:03:40.579> scared<00:03:40.699> and<00:03:41.060> and<00:03:41.750> they<00:03:41.870> quit<00:03:42.169> when

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
they get scared and and they quit when

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.099 
they get scared and and they quit when
they're<00:03:42.590> scared<00:03:42.739> and<00:03:43.129> it's<00:03:43.220> not<00:03:43.430> so<00:03:43.669> much<00:03:44.109> you

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:45.109 
they're scared and it's not so much you

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:47.349 
they're scared and it's not so much you
know<00:03:45.199> there<00:03:45.590> are<00:03:45.620> times<00:03:45.889> where<00:03:46.639> where<00:03:47.209> it

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359 
know there are times where where it

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:49.689 
know there are times where where it
would<00:03:47.540> be<00:03:47.720> a<00:03:48.019> good<00:03:48.349> idea<00:03:48.410> to<00:03:48.799> walk<00:03:49.129> away<00:03:49.310> if<00:03:49.609> you

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:49.699 
would be a good idea to walk away if you

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:51.970 
would be a good idea to walk away if you
are<00:03:49.849> truly<00:03:50.120> hurt<00:03:50.480> I<00:03:50.720> had<00:03:51.500> something<00:03:51.799> that

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
are truly hurt I had something that

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.439 
are truly hurt I had something that
clearly<00:03:52.340> was<00:03:52.909> not<00:03:52.940> as<00:03:53.510> serious<00:03:54.260> as<00:03:55.000> my<00:03:56.000> initial

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:56.449 
clearly was not as serious as my initial

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:59.080 
clearly was not as serious as my initial
reaction<00:03:56.889> thought<00:03:57.889> it<00:03:58.069> was<00:03:58.250> and<00:03:58.549> it<00:03:58.790> took<00:03:59.000> a

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
reaction thought it was and it took a

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.059 
reaction thought it was and it took a
little<00:03:59.239> bit<00:03:59.359> of<00:03:59.419> processing<00:03:59.629> to<00:04:00.379> to<00:04:00.739> figure

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
little bit of processing to to figure

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.949 
little bit of processing to to figure
that<00:04:01.250> out<00:04:01.310> but<00:04:04.000> what<00:04:05.000> it<00:04:05.090> comes<00:04:05.269> down<00:04:05.359> to<00:04:05.720> is<00:04:05.870> I

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
that out but what it comes down to is I

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.520 
that out but what it comes down to is I
was<00:04:06.109> able<00:04:06.260> to<00:04:06.440> get<00:04:06.560> through<00:04:06.799> it<00:04:06.829> and<00:04:07.159> I

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
was able to get through it and I

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.530 
was able to get through it and I
and<00:04:07.620> because<00:04:08.130> I<00:04:08.360> made<00:04:09.360> myself<00:04:09.600> at<00:04:10.020> least<00:04:10.260> try<00:04:10.620> I

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
and because I made myself at least try I

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.850 
and because I made myself at least try I
found<00:04:12.540> that<00:04:12.720> out<00:04:12.870> I<00:04:13.140> figured<00:04:13.350> if<00:04:13.590> I<00:04:13.650> would<00:04:13.800> have

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
found that out I figured if I would have

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.199 
found that out I figured if I would have
gone<00:04:13.950> down<00:04:14.190> and<00:04:14.340> it<00:04:14.430> hurt<00:04:14.610> and<00:04:14.850> it<00:04:14.970> would<00:04:15.120> have

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
gone down and it hurt and it would have

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:16.610 
gone down and it hurt and it would have
hurt<00:04:15.360> me<00:04:15.540> to<00:04:15.660> the<00:04:15.750> point<00:04:15.900> where<00:04:16.139> it<00:04:16.260> felt<00:04:16.470> like

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
hurt me to the point where it felt like

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:17.720 
hurt me to the point where it felt like
it<00:04:16.739> was<00:04:16.829> dangerous<00:04:16.980> i<00:04:17.310> would<00:04:17.400> have<00:04:17.489> dumped<00:04:17.639> the

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
it was dangerous i would have dumped the

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.199 
it was dangerous i would have dumped the
bar<00:04:17.910> and<00:04:18.060> walked<00:04:18.209> away<00:04:18.620> but<00:04:19.620> when<00:04:20.209> you're

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
bar and walked away but when you're

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.720 
bar and walked away but when you're
willing<00:04:21.389> to<00:04:21.900> to<00:04:22.410> push<00:04:22.980> yourself<00:04:23.430> to<00:04:23.580> that

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
willing to to push yourself to that

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.720 
willing to to push yourself to that
point<00:04:24.060> and<00:04:24.330> you're<00:04:24.419> willing<00:04:24.600> to<00:04:24.930> not<00:04:25.550> take<00:04:26.550> the

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
point and you're willing to not take the

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.610 
point and you're willing to not take the
easy<00:04:26.880> way<00:04:27.090> out<00:04:27.210> you<00:04:27.900> can<00:04:28.080> surprise<00:04:28.350> yourself

easy way out you can surprise yourself

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.600 
easy way out you can surprise yourself
quite<00:04:29.100> often<00:04:30.500> after<00:04:31.500> the<00:04:31.830> squatting<00:04:32.130> I<00:04:32.400> moved

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
quite often after the squatting I moved

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.000 
quite often after the squatting I moved
over<00:04:32.700> to<00:04:32.850> bench<00:04:33.030> press<00:04:33.120> it<00:04:33.600> was<00:04:33.750> a<00:04:33.780> 365<00:04:34.680> for

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
over to bench press it was a 365 for

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.620 
over to bench press it was a 365 for
five<00:04:35.190> doubles<00:04:35.610> today<00:04:35.790> this<00:04:36.000> is<00:04:36.060> definitely

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
five doubles today this is definitely

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.540 
five doubles today this is definitely
the<00:04:36.750> most<00:04:36.930> volume<00:04:37.710> I've<00:04:37.860> ever<00:04:38.040> done<00:04:38.220> at<00:04:38.400> this

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
the most volume I've ever done at this

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.230 
the most volume I've ever done at this
weight<00:04:38.790> and<00:04:39.440> I<00:04:40.440> was<00:04:41.430> pretty<00:04:41.669> pleased<00:04:41.940> with<00:04:41.970> the

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
weight and I was pretty pleased with the

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.380 
weight and I was pretty pleased with the
results<00:04:42.690> I<00:04:43.260> was<00:04:43.919> having<00:04:44.400> a<00:04:44.520> little<00:04:45.060> bit<00:04:45.180> of<00:04:45.240> an

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
results I was having a little bit of an

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.800 
results I was having a little bit of an
issue<00:04:45.510> with<00:04:45.780> the<00:04:45.900> rib<00:04:46.550> in<00:04:47.550> this<00:04:48.270> and<00:04:48.450> so<00:04:48.540> I<00:04:48.570> did

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
issue with the rib in this and so I did

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.090 
issue with the rib in this and so I did
decide<00:04:49.050> i<00:04:49.110> was<00:04:49.350> going<00:04:49.470> to<00:04:49.500> belt<00:04:49.710> up<00:04:49.890> and<00:04:50.070> I

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
decide i was going to belt up and I

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.680 
decide i was going to belt up and I
figured<00:04:50.370> it's<00:04:50.490> about<00:04:50.550> time<00:04:50.730> anyway<00:04:51.270> I'm<00:04:51.390> three

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
figured it's about time anyway I'm three

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.000 
figured it's about time anyway I'm three
weeks<00:04:51.870> out<00:04:51.990> from<00:04:52.050> the<00:04:52.320> need<00:04:52.500> so<00:04:52.740> I<00:04:52.770> should

weeks out from the need so I should

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.460 
weeks out from the need so I should
probably<00:04:53.040> start<00:04:53.580> working<00:04:54.050> with<00:04:55.050> all<00:04:55.260> the
