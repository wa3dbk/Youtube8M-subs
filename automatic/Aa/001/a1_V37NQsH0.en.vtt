off<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.760> line<00:02:17.910> but<00:02:18.150> then<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.510> Peugeot<00:02:18.900> has

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.870 
off the line but then the Peugeot has
extra<00:02:19.230> power<00:02:19.440> told<00:02:19.710> at<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:19.920> end<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.280> it<00:02:20.670> just

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
extra power told at the end and it just

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.250 
extra power told at the end and it just
managed<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.210> gain<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.750> little<00:02:21.930> bit<00:02:22.080> of<00:02:22.200> an

just<00:06:11.070> really<00:06:11.550> frustrating<00:06:12.120> because<00:06:12.150> you<00:06:12.420> know

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.480 
just really frustrating because you know

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.790 
just really frustrating because you know
you'd<00:06:12.720> hit<00:06:12.870> them<00:06:13.020> for<00:06:13.110> a<00:06:13.200> Down<00:06:13.350> change<00:06:13.620> it<00:06:13.770> just

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
you'd hit them for a Down change it just

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.610 
you'd hit them for a Down change it just
wouldn't<00:06:14.160> always<00:06:14.310> respond<00:06:14.990> and<00:06:15.990> the<00:06:16.410> rides

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
wouldn't always respond and the rides

wouldn't always respond and the rides
just<00:06:16.740> a<00:06:16.950> bit<00:06:17.100> firm<00:06:17.280> as<00:06:17.460> well

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 
just a bit firm as well

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.670 
just a bit firm as well
sometimes<00:06:18.450> those<00:06:18.660> declare<00:06:19.020> winner<00:06:19.200> in<00:06:19.380> a<00:06:19.470> test

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
sometimes those declare winner in a test

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.950 
sometimes those declare winner in a test
like<00:06:19.890> this<00:06:20.190> but<00:06:20.490> often<00:06:21.030> it's<00:06:21.270> only<00:06:21.480> decided

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 
like this but often it's only decided
