00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.550
 the famous rich cousin where he 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.790
 hardly take for the taxi when 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.140
 even that's okay we're a little tired of 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.240
 to do the taxi but it does not matter we have 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.730
 looked for the little jacob cerami has the 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.160
 push her and push you my friend and 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.740
 I do not know why every time 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.210

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.490
 and net if there is no tangled 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.140
 it's going to happen something I 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.609
 mean we're not going to search 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.960
 our dear friend jacob guitl he goes there 

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:36.789
 to have something else clear and clear 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.229
 otherwise the mission would be too simple in 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:43.960
 same time otherwise it would not be gt1 then 

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:47.979
 go the little watch world to bagnols 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.510
 oh yes still behind novel 

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:52.179
 straight on down street 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:56.139
 ok so go h clear no problem 

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:56.649
 direction shoot the air go on the mugs 

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:58.749
 to date 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:01.269
 it's you nico the one whose Roman does not 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:08.110
 speak all the time there is this ayhan 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:09.520

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.560
 somewhere where I need you morning 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.810
 you see yes yes I see the thing I see 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.220
 the trick you 'll get a gun 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.500
 alright I'm still starting to 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.730
 to understand very slowly the thing there I 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.010
 will have to wait is a slab a 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.500
 gun is still quite expensive or your 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.300
 story I feel it well 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.190
 you assure cousin romane thanks respect 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.620
 no problem my friend there is a point 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.690
 of view there hardware hugues I am 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.270
 doubted the langouille so I still 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.190
 take out the guen so that's nice 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.960
 on gt rdpc is frankly compared to 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.840
 console after I do not really know 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.810
 so this is the target on pc I love referred 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.280
 down on pc frankly I do not know after 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.490
 to eat I'm used to a mouse 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.690
 now while at the time I 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.820
 were playing at I was finally 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.110
 ok that's not it ultra long ago 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.550
 no more but I mean at the time I 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.590
 only played on consoles so 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.750
 inevitably I used the pad but 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.690
 there lately it's been a year since I 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.640
 almost only plays on pc so necessarily 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.120
 I'm more used to the mouse than 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.070
 joystick so that's it and we always 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.890
 says that if we are used to the mouse 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.610
 logically we are more precise after that 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.520
 remains to be checked 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.740
 I think if a mouse pro vs 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.970
 a pro from the controller 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.460
 certainly the mouse pro the project has 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.310
 smile will beat him 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.770
 now is the pro I want 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.420
 say if we have a normal low pc player 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:37.210
 ie not a pro like 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:38.710
 I think the guy who is strong 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.540
 with are not said can compete we 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.190
 against against a product the mouse 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.120
 I do not really know that 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.680
 check 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.570
 frankly I do not know I tell him 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.790
 not that I see rdpc it's better or 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.740
 other or the ola at the wheel the wheel the 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.980
 wheel go on we continue we put them back 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.450
 in the ass and will fall there I thought 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:01.650
 not even a flat boom 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:03.550
 here we are again no ok are we going through 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.980
 by cons what I'm going to do there 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.530
 friends it's still I will go 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.870
 to pick up 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.040
 but famous gun why am I going rahman 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.260
 just because it makes a difference 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.690
 max ammunition and that basle and 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.950
 ammunition it's downright not given 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.569
 frankly it's downright not giving 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.670
 especially we left at the end of the game 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.830
 of course it's something else but in the beginning 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.640
 of part I think it's better to 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.319
 my weapons quite serious 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.300
 I think we agree on that 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.709
 I still have japan elsewhere because 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.020
 that I had stolen a car two 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.880
 policemen friends or la it's not 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.730
 well go hop we'll get them so 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.930
 as I told you a gta is still there 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.640
 a little hidden thing actually not 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.680
 just the taxi there is always 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.820
 Something 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.920
 by cons my life that is really very 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.620
 down it's a little hot dog there friends 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.620
 frankly it would go well in 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:53.310
 bring back the famous little jacob 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.569
 and then and then it will be perfect thank you 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.860
 for all you can keep a gun I 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:00.260
 believe that you know how to use it better than 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:04.769
 me, thank you buddy that's nice 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:06.510
 hawk cause all of them so that's it 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.810
 backup in progress it's perfect we have 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.579
 finished the little all-green with romance and 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.930
 so bar will be able to go to the side of 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.269
 help because they had passed us 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.250
 a phone call that's called 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.320
 Romanesque which vlad who we have passed a 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.239
 call why in your opinion everything 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.560
 just because romance told him 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.580
 we would do a show for him so 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:29.760
 this is so whitening that I thought that 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.070

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.120
 episode will have pleased you friends if it's 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.180
