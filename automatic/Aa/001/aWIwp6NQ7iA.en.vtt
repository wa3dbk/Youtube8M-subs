00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.339
 of the headphones and the point with you on the 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.520
 helmets for children and helmets for 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.520
 women 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.789
 we will start with our dear heads 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.619
 blondes 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:18.669
 first of all know that the law you 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:20.710
 authorizes to transport a child 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:22.150
 only if his feet can rest 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.250
 flat on the footrests 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.050
 if it is too small it is necessary to use a 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.759
 seat specially provided for this purpose 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.009
 usually found in all 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.420
 props forget about doing the evening 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.980
 in front of us it's totally interview 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.780
 so what about the equipment 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.339
 only the helmet is mandatory but it 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.980
 is strongly advised to add a 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:40.600
 jacket gloves resistant pants 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.850
 the pairs of high shoes 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.110
 to get back to the helmet more and 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.820
 more manufacturers offer the 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.589
 products specially developed for 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.750
 children with weights and sizes 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:51.850
 studied for their little heads we're going 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.000
 talk for example about trip size xs 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.710
 to the bones the decorations also follows 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.379
 this trend with most often 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.820
 motley enough motives however even 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.619
 if there are jet helmets for 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.210
 children for safety sake the 

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:05.890
 central helmet distribute that 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.140
 full helmets because it's still 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.280
 the best existing protection 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.689
 the disadvantage is that even a headset 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.400
 for children can be too heavy 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:14.560
 for the little ones so if you have 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.660
 the slightest doubt about the helmet 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.160
 equipment or position of the child 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.390
 on the round back and well the best 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.850
 thing to do before taking it with 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.260
 you it is to wait until they grow up 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.730
 concerning women now their 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.270
 head is usually smaller than 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.159
 that of men 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.620
 be careful, it does not prevent them from being 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.120
 busy seriously only 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.000
 some brands are designing breaks 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.260
 specifically dedicated to women 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.450
 with particular thicknesses of foam 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.560
 more important at the level of the cheeks but 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.090
 other than that they can logically 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.190
 pretend to any helmet of the 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.990
 market in a concern for aesthetics in 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.659
 contrast more and more two colors 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.650
 are thought for women 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.570
 but be careful not to put the loot 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.729
 too much forward because a little helmet 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.860
 fashion is cute it's comfortable 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.720
 when we drive but when we follow it is 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.210
 not the same so privileged when 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.470
 even the protection and comfort the ideal 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.320
 for the city for example it's a 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.490
 crossover type headphones
