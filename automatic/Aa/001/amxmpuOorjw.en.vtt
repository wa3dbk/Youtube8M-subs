very<00:02:41.440> soft<00:02:44.250> we<00:02:45.250> take<00:02:45.580> just<00:02:46.060> a<00:02:46.330> parsley<00:02:46.900> leaves

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:55.710 
very soft we take just a parsley leaves
fresh<00:02:48.480> so<00:02:49.480> I<00:02:49.510> chop<00:02:50.110> very<00:02:50.530> very<00:02:50.920> thin<00:02:54.720> the

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
fresh so I chop very very thin the

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.940 
fresh so I chop very very thin the
better<00:02:55.930> to<00:02:56.320> use<00:02:56.850> the<00:02:57.850> knife<00:02:58.260> not<00:02:59.260> a<00:02:59.290> mixer

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
better to use the knife not a mixer

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.610 
better to use the knife not a mixer
because<00:03:00.220> you<00:03:00.940> destroy<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.570> power<00:03:02.049> slaves<00:03:02.440> a

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
because you destroy the power slaves a

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:13.600 
because you destroy the power slaves a
mixer<00:03:03.070> superior<00:03:03.850> yes<00:03:04.150> is<00:03:04.390> not<00:03:04.600> the<00:03:04.810> point

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.619 

so<00:03:14.610> result<00:03:15.120> have<00:03:15.330> to<00:03:15.540> be<00:03:15.720> very<00:03:16.170> very<00:03:16.379> thin<00:03:17.189> and

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 
so result have to be very very thin and

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:24.530 
so result have to be very very thin and
I<00:03:18.629> reserve<00:03:20.629> in<00:03:21.629> a<00:03:21.780> separate<00:03:22.290> Bowl<00:03:22.739> so<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:24.299> next

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
I reserve in a separate Bowl so the next

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:31.910 
I reserve in a separate Bowl so the next
step<00:03:24.750> is<00:03:25.579> to<00:03:26.989> mix<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.409> butter<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:30.709> do<00:03:31.709> like

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
step is to mix the butter to do like

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.619 
step is to mix the butter to do like
