00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:07.210
 hello everyone welcome on the channel 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:09.309
 youtube of catharsis so in this 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.550
 video we're going to look at a 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:14.620
 precise passage of the map of a 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:21.279
 war sheets that do not card horn 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:24.249
 if I'm not mistaken a passage or in 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.919
 a corner of the map is a point of 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:29.679
 panoramas and a jumping so with the 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:31.630
 same pathway what is Corsican a 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:33.429
 little things for those of a 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.079
 part who want to finish the map without 

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:37.840
 necessarily want to do and jumping there 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.579
 you will have to spend what then 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.500
 I recall the principle of jumping is 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.199
 a place on the map with jumps to 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.050
 to do or sometimes puzzles of 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:50.640
 labyrinths and it's a pure at the end 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.640
 to get a success and a safe 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:02.400
 so on this video we did 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:06.210
 some small cuts for rendering 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.830
 to avoid you from attending 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.030
 number of falls actually during 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.070
 the climb but he did not have much 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.010
 on this one but a few when 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.300
 even so do not be surprised if you 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:21.270
 see some fittings a little bit bad 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:23.070
 damned so here we start at this act and 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.330
 to tackle a part of the map that 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.460
 start a little bit complicated 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.640
 so with closed angle jumps 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.920
 as you can see there 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.040
 the ideal is to put oneself on 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.560
 outside we will say the passage here 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.950
 to open the camera angle and 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.490
 jump we'll say as straight as possible 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.490
 from one point to another 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.060
 maybe some will be more to 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.860
 comfortable with speed oxen but 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.710
 let's say most of the jumping 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.659
 should see unfold without I believe 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.400
 that we used only two on the whole 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.850
 on seals that are relatively 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.850
 remote 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.260
 so that's the most boring passage 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.260
 technically completely closed angle 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.660
 besides a third agreement so that's it 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.360
 it's a little bit ban ki-moon hours the 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.520
 luck so normally if you fall 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.050
 you do not fall too much ben that you do not 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.150
 not you die almost no waste 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.390
 life to fall just one floor down 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.350
 so that's still not very 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.350
 binding to say 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.340
 on this kind on this kind of jumping 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.680
 it is not necessarily the case but in 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.520
 others the characters the others 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.900
 players type huge tanks we'll say a 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.550
 gauge therefore risk you 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.620
 block the view so I advise you to 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.490
 pass in front 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.020
 because it can be quite embarrassing 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.020
 level of distance approximation 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.500
 here are in this case do not do 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.130
 like the last one you have to jump to the end 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.130
 September 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.200
 so that's the biggest you are 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.810
 remains more than to jump on them on 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.760
 boards so at the end of the boards you 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:36.410
 have the point of panoramas we see 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:38.030
 here once you've taken the point 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.710
 of panoramas do not forget the safe 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.700
 done that's right behind with the 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:45.350
 Norman success that appears 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.270
 here and after the trunk usually 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.740
 you have a champion team boss who has 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.740
 does not seem insurmountable 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:58.550
 so here we are going to close this video and 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:05.680
 we ended up on another thank you to 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:05.680
 all and good game seen heating 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.680
 Fraikin
