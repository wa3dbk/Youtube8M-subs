symbols anywhere it's not about the
location<00:02:09.190> they're<00:02:09.369> made<00:02:09.550> it's<00:02:09.850> the<00:02:10.000> process

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
location they're made it's the process

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.059 
location they're made it's the process
of<00:02:10.569> how<00:02:10.630> they're<00:02:10.899> made<00:02:11.050> that's<00:02:11.350> quite<00:02:11.620> true<00:02:11.650> I

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
of how they're made that's quite true I

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
mean it like I said we learned how to do

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.860 
mean it like I said we learned how to do
it<00:02:13.990> from<00:02:14.170> from<00:02:14.620> people<00:02:14.650> from<00:02:15.130> Turkey<00:02:15.370> and

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
we're doing the exact same type

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.670 
we're doing the exact same type

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
America and it isn't it there makes no

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.270 
America and it isn't it there makes no
difference<00:02:24.220> as<00:02:24.610> to<00:02:24.880> where<00:02:25.120> it's<00:02:25.840> how<00:02:26.140> if<00:02:27.070> you

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
difference as to where it's how if you

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.070 
difference as to where it's how if you
do<00:02:27.460> it<00:02:27.610> correctly<00:02:27.760> if<00:02:28.270> you<00:02:28.570> use<00:02:28.840> hand

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
right shape use the right hammer pattern

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.990 
right shape use the right hammer pattern
if<00:02:34.870> use<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.290> right<00:02:35.470> peen<00:02:35.860> that's<00:02:36.640> very

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
if use the right peen that's very

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.540 
if use the right peen that's very
important<00:02:37.480> if<00:02:37.570> you<00:02:37.810> use<00:02:38.110> actually<00:02:38.740> the<00:02:39.310> right

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
type of metal in the hammer it makes a

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.810 
type of metal in the hammer it makes a
difference<00:02:43.270> really<00:02:43.570> yep<00:02:43.990> and<00:02:44.260> we<00:02:45.160> have<00:02:45.400> we've

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
difference really yep and we have we've

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.910 
difference really yep and we have we've
learned<00:02:46.030> those<00:02:46.210> over<00:02:46.480> years<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:46.990> the

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
learned those over years and the

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.140 
learned those over years and the
opportunity<00:02:48.520> to<00:02:48.580> be<00:02:48.640> able<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:48.850> make<00:02:48.940> something

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
opportunity to be able to make something

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.640 
opportunity to be able to make something
different<00:02:49.270> from<00:02:49.780> what<00:02:49.870> we've<00:02:50.200> been<00:02:50.350> doing

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
different from what we've been doing

different from what we've been doing
your<00:02:51.160> type<00:02:51.400> of<00:02:51.610> sounds<00:02:52.330> your<00:02:52.690> type<00:02:52.900> of<00:02:53.080> shapes

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
your type of sounds your type of shapes

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.930 
your type of sounds your type of shapes
we<00:02:54.190> jumped<00:02:54.520> at<00:02:54.610> that<00:02:54.690> definitely<00:02:55.690> well<00:02:56.940> thank
