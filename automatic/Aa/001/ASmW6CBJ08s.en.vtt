the chicken CQB is the gun that i

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.060 
the chicken CQB is the gun that i
personally<00:00:27.449> have<00:00:27.750> really<00:00:27.960> use<00:00:28.170> i<00:00:28.380> just<00:00:28.949> don't

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
personally have really use i just don't

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.890 
personally have really use i just don't
really<00:00:29.189> like<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.849> shoots<00:00:30.210> incredibly<00:00:30.660> fast

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
really like it shoots incredibly fast

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.520 
really like it shoots incredibly fast
but<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.260> seems<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.650> kill<00:00:31.920> so<00:00:32.640> slow<00:00:33.380> like<00:00:34.380> it

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
but it seems to kill so slow like it

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.350 
but it seems to kill so slow like it
literally<00:00:34.860> takes<00:00:35.250> like<00:00:35.489> three<00:00:35.910> four

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
literally takes like three four

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.170

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
weapon but I kind of feel like switching

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.100 
weapon but I kind of feel like switching
it<00:00:44.340> up<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.520> little<00:00:44.670> bit<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.329> honestly<00:00:45.930> don't

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
it up a little bit and honestly don't

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.000

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
feel like playing something like

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.920 
feel like playing something like
domination<00:00:47.820> because<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.300> just<00:00:48.539> don't<00:00:48.780> enjoy

playing<00:00:49.350> desk<00:00:49.700> so<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:50.730> thought<00:00:50.969> I'd<00:00:51.120> mix<00:00:51.270> up<00:00:51.480> the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
playing desk so I thought I'd mix up the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.020 
playing desk so I thought I'd mix up the
guns<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.989> little<00:00:52.230> bit<00:00:52.489> so<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.760> exactly

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
guns a little bit so that is exactly

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.430 
guns a little bit so that is exactly
what<00:00:54.300> I'm<00:00:54.390> going<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.629> be<00:00:54.690> doing<00:00:54.870> anyway<00:00:55.260> the

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
strike and then the stealth chopper I've

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.010 
strike and then the stealth chopper I've
basically<00:01:08.070> been<00:01:08.310> using<00:01:08.760> my<00:01:08.909> old<00:01:09.090> go<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.390> set<00:01:09.840> up

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
basically been using my old go to set up

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.840 
basically been using my old go to set up
quite<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> bit<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.770> kid<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.070> just<00:01:11.220> kind<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.520> like<00:01:11.700> it

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
quite a bit a kid I just kind of like it

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.640 
quite a bit a kid I just kind of like it
actually<00:01:12.000> like<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.900> stealth<00:01:13.140> chopper<00:01:13.470> it's

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
actually like the stealth chopper it's

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.960 
actually like the stealth chopper it's
just<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:13.860> incredibly<00:01:14.250> powerful<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.670> stopped

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
just so incredibly powerful I stopped

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.469 
just so incredibly powerful I stopped
using<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.390> for<00:01:16.259> like<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> couple<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:16.920> weeks<00:01:17.159> I

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
using it for like a couple of weeks I

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.310 
using it for like a couple of weeks I
mean<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.540> has<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.659> bit<00:01:18.840> more<00:01:18.960> than<00:01:19.140> just<00:01:19.259> a

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
mean it has a bit more than just a

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.230 
mean it has a bit more than just a
couple<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.590> weeks<00:01:19.770> actually<00:01:20.030> but<00:01:21.030> then

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
couple of weeks actually but then

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.570 
couple of weeks actually but then
yesterday<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.409> started<00:01:22.830> using<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.159> again<00:01:23.400> and

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
yesterday I started using it again and

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.210 
yesterday I started using it again and
it's<00:01:23.729> just<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.060> powerful<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:25.049> really<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:25.950> this

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
it's just so powerful it really is this

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.490 
it's just so powerful it really is this
is<00:01:26.400> probably<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.820> best<00:01:27.210> like<00:01:27.509> maybe<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:28.380> know

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
is probably the best like maybe you know

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.020 
is probably the best like maybe you know
something<00:01:28.799> like<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.009> swarm<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.610> course<00:01:29.880> get

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
something like a swarm of course get

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.910 
something like a swarm of course get
more<00:01:30.270> kills<00:01:30.509> from<00:01:31.140> their<00:01:31.350> stealth<00:01:31.619> chopper

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
more kills from their stealth chopper

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.990 
more kills from their stealth chopper
but<00:01:32.100> i<00:01:32.130> know<00:01:32.220> i'm<00:01:32.340> honestly<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.700> stuff

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
but i know i'm honestly the stuff

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.350 
but i know i'm honestly the stuff
trouble<00:01:33.360> gets<00:01:33.540> quite<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.170> lot<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.530> kills

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
trouble gets quite a lot of kills

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.310 
trouble gets quite a lot of kills
especially<00:01:36.360> considering<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:36.990> only<00:01:37.110> need

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
especially considering you only need

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.230 
especially considering you only need
something<00:01:37.619> like<00:01:37.710> 1100<00:01:38.430> points<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.790> get<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.060> I

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
something like 1100 points to get it I

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.130 
something like 1100 points to get it I
think<00:01:39.479> it's<00:01:39.570> eleven<00:01:39.840> hundred<00:01:39.900> points

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
think it's eleven hundred points

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.469 
think it's eleven hundred points
actually<00:01:40.790> so<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.060> actually<00:01:42.180> not<00:01:42.420> even

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
actually so that is actually not even

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.200 
actually so that is actually not even
like<00:01:42.750> too<00:01:42.990> bad<00:01:43.290> that's<00:01:44.189> pretty<00:01:44.490> easy<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:45.030> do

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
like too bad that's pretty easy to do

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.499 
like too bad that's pretty easy to do
got<00:01:46.079> one<00:01:46.290> do<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:46.500> over<00:01:46.710> here<00:01:47.329> isobe<00:01:48.329> announced

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
got one do it over here isobe announced

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.990 
got one do it over here isobe announced
now<00:01:49.229> as<00:01:49.290> one<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.890> was<00:01:50.189> one<00:01:50.340> pulled<00:01:50.610> away<00:01:50.759> from

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
now as one I was one pulled away from

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.060 
now as one I was one pulled away from
death<00:01:51.210> anyway<00:01:51.600> but<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.560> wasn't<00:01:52.770> much<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:52.920> I

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
death anyway but it wasn't much that I

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.929 
death anyway but it wasn't much that I
could<00:01:53.189> have<00:01:53.280> done<00:01:53.430> about<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.790> well

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
could have done about that well

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.880 
could have done about that well
basically<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.509> should<00:01:54.689> have<00:01:54.780> just<00:01:54.869> laid<00:01:55.619> back

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
basically you should have just laid back

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.880 
basically you should have just laid back
I<00:01:56.130> should<00:01:56.430> have<00:01:56.520> run<00:01:56.790> into<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:57.740> gunfire<00:01:58.740> I

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
I should have run into that gunfire I

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.860 
I should have run into that gunfire I
was<00:01:59.009> dumb

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
was dumb

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.560 
was dumb
it<00:02:01.500> was<00:02:01.590> my<00:02:01.830> fault<00:02:01.890> for<00:02:02.490> too<00:02:02.730> much<00:02:02.880> an<00:02:03.300> ice<00:02:03.420> pick

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
it was my fault for too much an ice pick

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.540 
it was my fault for too much an ice pick
up<00:02:03.720> this<00:02:03.810> thing<00:02:03.990> actually<00:02:04.110> just<00:02:05.010> for<00:02:05.160> a<00:02:05.190> second

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
up this thing actually just for a second

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:06.860 
up this thing actually just for a second
because<00:02:05.610> I<00:02:05.790> noticed<00:02:06.180> someone<00:02:06.390> over<00:02:06.690> in<00:02:06.750> that

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
because I noticed someone over in that

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.380 
because I noticed someone over in that
area<00:02:07.160> so<00:02:08.160> we<00:02:08.250> just<00:02:08.400> sprinted<00:02:08.850> from<00:02:08.970> one<00:02:09.180> side

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
area so we just sprinted from one side

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.420 
area so we just sprinted from one side
to<00:02:09.420> another<00:02:09.630> sides<00:02:10.080> not<00:02:10.800> entirely<00:02:11.100> sure<00:02:11.190> with

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
to another sides not entirely sure with

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.680 
to another sides not entirely sure with
the<00:02:11.490> red<00:02:11.640> right<00:02:11.850> now<00:02:11.880> I'm<00:02:12.240> guessing<00:02:12.570> that

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
the red right now I'm guessing that

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.570 
the red right now I'm guessing that
they're<00:02:12.810> spoiling<00:02:13.050> over<00:02:13.290> here<00:02:13.500> instead<00:02:14.460> of

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
they're spoiling over here instead of

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.120 
they're spoiling over here instead of
over<00:02:14.700> there<00:02:15.530> yeah<00:02:16.530> I'm<00:02:16.650> pretty<00:02:16.800> sure<00:02:17.010> about

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
over there yeah I'm pretty sure about

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.990 
over there yeah I'm pretty sure about
that<00:02:17.400> how<00:02:18.060> they<00:02:18.180> work<00:02:18.270> and<00:02:18.390> took<00:02:18.570> it<00:02:18.720> down<00:02:20.000> you

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
that how they work and took it down you

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.140 
that how they work and took it down you
bastards<00:02:22.340> we<00:02:23.340> weren't<00:02:23.430> supposed<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.850> take<00:02:24.030> it

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
bastards we weren't supposed to take it

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.080 
bastards we weren't supposed to take it
down<00:02:24.300> I<00:02:24.860> want<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:25.890> rush<00:02:26.130> it<00:02:26.340> I<00:02:26.520> know<00:02:26.880> that

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
down I want to rush it I know that

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.480 
down I want to rush it I know that
there's<00:02:27.210> someone<00:02:27.570> in<00:02:27.690> here<00:02:27.770> it<00:02:28.770> has<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.100> be<00:02:29.130> our

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
there's someone in here it has to be our

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.630 
there's someone in here it has to be our
teammates<00:02:30.060> well<00:02:30.450> genius<00:02:31.250> those<00:02:32.250> phones<00:02:32.460> have

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
teammates well genius those phones have

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.010 
teammates well genius those phones have
already<00:02:32.850> flipped<00:02:33.210> in<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.540> time<00:02:33.690> that<00:02:33.840> I

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
already flipped in the time that I

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.680 
already flipped in the time that I
basically<00:02:34.200> just<00:02:34.550> try<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:35.610> move<00:02:35.910> in<00:02:36.150> there<00:02:36.420> All

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
basically just try to move in there All

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.800 
basically just try to move in there All
Right<00:02:36.780> see<00:02:37.910> where<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.000> red<00:02:39.150> right<00:02:39.360> now<00:02:39.540> i'm

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
Right see where the red right now i'm

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.000 
Right see where the red right now i'm
guessing<00:02:40.110> to<00:02:40.200> throw<00:02:40.380> in<00:02:40.530> that<00:02:40.560> corner

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
guessing to throw in that corner

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.210 
guessing to throw in that corner
actually<00:02:41.960> if<00:02:42.960> only<00:02:43.140> someone<00:02:43.560> would<00:02:43.710> call<00:02:44.010> in

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
actually if only someone would call in

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.030 
actually if only someone would call in
something<00:02:44.550> simple<00:02:44.970> like<00:02:45.000> a<00:02:45.150> UAV<00:02:45.830> it's<00:02:46.830> like

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
something simple like a UAV it's like

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.890 
something simple like a UAV it's like
none<00:02:47.790> of<00:02:47.880> my<00:02:47.940> teammates<00:02:48.270> that<00:02:48.450> really<00:02:48.660> call<00:02:48.870> it

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
none of my teammates that really call it

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.560 
none of my teammates that really call it
anything<00:02:50.630> and<00:02:51.630> honestly<00:02:52.110> I<00:02:52.170> can't<00:02:52.530> remember<00:02:53.040> a

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
anything and honestly I can't remember a

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.000 
anything and honestly I can't remember a
teammate<00:02:54.570> getting<00:02:54.780> like<00:02:54.930> a<00:02:55.020> UAV<00:02:55.290> ravie<00:02:55.740> set

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
teammate getting like a UAV ravie set

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.330 
teammate getting like a UAV ravie set
for<00:02:56.370> me<00:02:56.490> like<00:02:56.700> randoms<00:02:58.130> sometimes<00:02:59.130> I<00:02:59.280> do

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
for me like randoms sometimes I do

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.830 
for me like randoms sometimes I do
invite<00:02:59.640> like<00:02:59.880> subscribers<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.540> stuff<00:03:00.720> like

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
that and they oftentimes get me like

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.960 
that and they oftentimes get me like
UAVs<00:03:04.650> and<00:03:04.680> stuff<00:03:05.130> like<00:03:05.280> that<00:03:05.340> which<00:03:05.580> is<00:03:05.760> nice

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
UAVs and stuff like that which is nice

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.449 
UAVs and stuff like that which is nice
that<00:03:06.300> definitely<00:03:06.959> does<00:03:07.140> help<00:03:07.320> me<00:03:07.440> out<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.860> ton

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
that definitely does help me out a ton

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.140 
that definitely does help me out a ton
actually<00:03:09.300> this<00:03:10.020> is<00:03:10.200> simple<00:03:10.590> UAV<00:03:11.010> as<00:03:11.670> simple<00:03:12.060> as

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
actually this is simple UAV as simple as

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.550 
actually this is simple UAV as simple as
they<00:03:12.300> may<00:03:12.450> be<00:03:12.510> they<00:03:12.870> are<00:03:12.900> just<00:03:13.110> so<00:03:13.410> so<00:03:14.280> helpful

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
they may be they are just so so helpful

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.020 
they may be they are just so so helpful
okay<00:03:16.560> I<00:03:16.590> was<00:03:16.709> like<00:03:16.860> where<00:03:17.430> you're<00:03:17.550> going<00:03:17.580> to<00:03:17.880> go

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
okay I was like where you're going to go

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.440 
okay I was like where you're going to go
decides<00:03:18.860> just<00:03:19.860> decide<00:03:20.250> already<00:03:20.610> let's<00:03:21.239> waste
