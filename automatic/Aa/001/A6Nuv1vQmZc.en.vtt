00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.620
 hello to all he made a fortune in the 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.570
 cartoon thanks to his house 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.369
 of sun productions editing is the 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.320
 president for seven years now the 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.460
 rugby club Toulon which is still in 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.650
 race for the championship title 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.760
 France and who will play in a little more 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.990
 two weeks now a final 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.280
 of a highly anticipated european cup against a 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.680
 other french club clermont 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.730
 hello mourad boudjellal hello the 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.810
 final of the european cup it's in 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.130
 two weeks I said it right now 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.570
 I have the impression that hostilities 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.579
 we will start and face clermont 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.570
 who will blame me for lying on 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.250
 his financial means 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.989
 why this reproach I can not 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.340
 simply blame a statement I say 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.230
 simply that today the club of 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.520
 Clermont has a lot of talent and 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.320
 a lot of money and that's it 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.450
 marriage of the two that make this club 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.470
 today is feared by Europe 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.660
 whole because they are beautiful 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.940
 team but that's a ca would 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.980
 reducer to say that clermont this is 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.480
 that a sum of talents is not 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.860
 true this is not insulting because 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.110
 that we too have money to 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.510
 Toulouse my part that on Toulon he has 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.059
 needed to create an economic model and on 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.100
 clermont there are analyzing have the chance 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.960
 to have shareholders who have for 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.280
 who rugby he barely represents the 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.020
 tip of a coffee in their figure 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.829
 business koala and and we are not of 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.450
 all in the same dimension 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:15.979
 me when I get up in the morning 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.869
 problem is how to create money 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.859
 to pay my charges because you 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.889
 say it's clearly some 

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:23.389
 way it's their problem is how 

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:25.279
 to spend our money 

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:26.749
 these two different ways of judo of 

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:28.279
 running a business that has nothing to 

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:29.569
 see it's a bit of a surprise to you 

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:31.500
 see clearly attack on this ground 

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:33.480
 there because the money 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.380
 the report uninhibited compared to 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.700
 money is a little what you 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.650
 play as toulon since a few years 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.850
 yes but no say so why the 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.260
 others do not say it but this is 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.210
 not insulting I did not insult anyone 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.250
 saying that I do not know an insult 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.660
 that to be able to benefit from the help of a 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.830
 big group like michelin which is everything 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.270
 to be respectable who is creative 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.700
 jobs and wealth creator in 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.840
 this country and even in the world so me 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.150
 I have absolutely nothing against michelin 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.920
 but we must recognize we must call 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.630
 a cat a cat actually say the ale 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.729
 so clearly today dominates the 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.080
 French rugby and European it's because 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.479
 that he has the support of a group like 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.649
 michelin point bar but that would not have 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.080
 not enough if he did not have the talent 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.910
 of men who have been able to make the 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.100
 michelin's investments the budget of 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.480
 Toulon today is how much we 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.489
 is not far from 28 million euros 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.420
 on the over all activities of the 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.489
 club 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.260
 but I do not put money yesterday was 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.420
 maintained in europe you have to create a CV 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.610
 inject money as above at 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.690
 departure of course for them to create for 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.250
 create the club economy but 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.780
 today the goal is that I do not 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.040
 put no money because first of all I 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.270
 can not afford to put 7 million 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.850
 euros so we continue 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.230
 I'm not michelin and if he's just 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.730
 so we will not drag on carbon 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.200
 the budget of clermont knows how much by 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.430
 report to toulon today the budget 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.390
 of clermont who is declared I believe he 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.620
 a 24 25 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.350
 but there are many things that 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.780
 can miss next inside the 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.980
 group I mean here is 28 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.540
 million for Toulon the goal is 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.070
 to arrive at 30 million budget year 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.840
 next or even more because we have 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.430
 potential for development in Toulon 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.810
 which is very very strong yet we are 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.269
 very far we are we are almost 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.410
 to the maximum of our charges 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.420
 we are very far from the maximum of our 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.340
 products one of the levers for 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.200
 increase club revenue 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.060
 these two 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.010
 to play in a bigger stadium is 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.930
 a subject that comes up regularly we have 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.379
 there two with the idea of ​​playing nice or 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.150
 marseille 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:12.290
 that's what will happen next year 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.090
 you will play more and more 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.200
 matches elsewhere than Toulon yes since 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.950
 we are lucky to have a 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.170
 geographical isolation and isolation 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.220
 geographical area and is therefore at a stage of 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.239
 nice that want it done thirty-six 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.170
 a thousand places that happens that's all 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.170
 nine who is all beautiful a stadium 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.870
 velodrome that will make 69,000 69 thousand 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.280
 places the the right bike at a 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.599
 half an hour from toulon the nice stadium to 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.040
 1h dear it's pretty much the same thing 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.340
 for a Parisian to go to the stadium 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.810
 la France 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.670
 and it will give a regional dimension 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.799
 at the club we will play with our advantages 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.000
 without leaving mayol so far not a 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.470
 opposition without leaving mayol since 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.720
 it's our mayol heart but we need 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.769
 needs big stadium then we know 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.030
 you do not just have friends in the 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.200
 rugby french rugby 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.239
 it's a running noise and it's a 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.920
 running noise we blame you for everything 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.390
 case we are often surprised by your 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.730
 ability to bring stars every 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.140
 year you're coming to formalize the 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.849
 coming from bryan habana next year 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.290
 how did he want to pay his 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:02.120
 star players with money like 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.160
 the others but except that this money 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.959
 by the economy as generates around the 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.530
 come from stars jonny wilkinson we 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.780
 costs 0 1 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.069
 we created an entire economy around 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.060
 around jonny wilkinson 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:14.500
 we have a network of partners including 2 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.610
 the club that already represents more than 10 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.200
 millions of euros we do not have much to 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.650
 to have reached that number and it's still going 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.570
 increase 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.190
 we have a network of subscriber supporters 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.770
 subscriptions the ticket office that 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.120
 still represents 7 8 million euros 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.200
 for merchandising more than three 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.250
 million and a half euros this year and 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.169
 it will still increase 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.000
 that's the economic one that generates 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:32.230
 but their maintenance then that is to say 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.570
 that this economy can not know 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.430
 generate if there are no stars this is a 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.690
 virtuous circle as you say and and 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.060
 then after in the intrigues 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.990
 it's easier to say they do 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.669
 come from the stars because they have 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.440
 a lot of money they make come from 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.940
 stars that we have not managed to 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.960
 summon 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.930
 there is another recurring controversy 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.450
 in rugby which is to say the 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.169
 clubs bring key positions to 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.920
 foreign stars 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.810
 it prevents you from drilling 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.670
 young French players and ultimately 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.690
 it weakens the team of France it's 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.830
 exactly what you are doing in toulouse 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.050
 we can blame you so 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.210
 and to say that my problem is 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.710
 win toulon and my problem 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.820
 is that these do not mean that there is 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.440
 foreigners who come to take the 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.700
 French job that's because I 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.110
 think the words and ideas to 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.220
 instances even in the world of sport there 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.200
 must do the presentation what is said 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.450
 I just think that today 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.250
 I have a team will handle that the 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.230
 France the French federation to a 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.610
 France team to manage each his own 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.380
 problem if we can help them we will 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.540
 help but considering that reciprocity is 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.980
 not true today we take care first 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.200
 of our club the French federation of 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.240
 rugby is not sure that she for 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.350
 what topics would you accept that 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.430
 in a company we take you a 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.510
 new employee for two months on 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.250
 you say you have just right the dpi 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.620
 are you asking in these 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.090
 conditions a compensation system I 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.100
 I 'm not invited to the team match 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.780
 of France with I have players on the 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.070
 lawn that I pay and there is no 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.300
 someone who told me hold the story 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.160
 France team is also yours 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.510
 we are going to invite you 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.470
 cocktail that goes well before match and then 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.210
 help us to be world champion 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.490
 living the thing together no one does not hold 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.230
 totally out of the way except in 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.730
 their relatives 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:00.170
 only you feeling today of what 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.810
 had where other predators 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:04.100
 there are presidents who start a 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.360
 started to get up but because there is 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.200
 entrepreneurs who arrived 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.820
 in rugby they are independent 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.630
 say before there was a lot of 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.010
 presidents who were not 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.150
 independent of the federation today this 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.140
 no longer at all but all 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.720
 new presidents are totally 

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:16.670
 independent and and are stunned by 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.420
 what they see is what 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.040
 professionalised 

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.690
 for a few years so more and 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.890
 more entrepreneurs and it's going in the 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.270
 common sense to your point of view for 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.410
 change them dispensed it goes in the 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.060
 common sense but not fast enough I want 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.430
 say today French rugby in 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.690
 time in a management mode 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.830
 repressive he has people still have not 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.420
 understood that if they want to develop 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.930
 the team of France it is necessary and the 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.520
 training 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.810
 you have to make the incentive 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.130
 entrepreneurs know how to divert the 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.780
 repressive but as they are 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.040
 entrepreneurs they will dive into the 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.390
 hasty site because it will be interesting 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.950
 for objective what is it to compare 

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.660
 the incentive is the remuneration of the 

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.740
 training for example and the piles of 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.730
 systems for developing the 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.410
 French training but it's a lot 

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:50.060
 more difficult it takes a lot more 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.500
 of intelligence to make an incentive 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.660
 what to do with the repressive repressive 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.340
 it's the law of the poor the incentive and 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.560
 there I could talk to the federation 

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.480
 pay the information today the 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.430
 premium rugby is that there are those who 

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:03.110
 have money at these camps the know the 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:05.090
 know is not we can not do anything 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.250
 against money restoring the balanced 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.110
 for these training clubs that there is 

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.700
 real 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:12.580
 these two formations of real 

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.780
 obligations for players of 

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.850
 stay in their training club 

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:17.350
 otherwise the contract must be purchased by the 

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:18.370
 club which money and you will see 

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.330
 that it will change things because 

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.440
 clubs like money they're not going 

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.270
 spend their life buying the contracts 

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.040
 a building site for the French federation 

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:25.480
 rugby 

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:27.990
 thank you very much added the lah soon 

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.990
