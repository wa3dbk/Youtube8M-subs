you're coming from a dirt bike
background<00:00:45.410> you<00:00:45.559> can<00:00:45.680> keep<00:00:46.070> doing<00:00:46.220> a<00:00:46.370> lot<00:00:46.550> of

what<00:00:46.790> you're<00:00:46.910> doing<00:00:47.030> you're<00:00:47.210> going<00:00:47.300> to<00:00:47.360> have

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
what you're doing you're going to have

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.880 
what you're doing you're going to have
to<00:00:47.600> adjust<00:00:47.720> to<00:00:47.989> using<00:00:48.260> a<00:00:48.320> lot<00:00:48.440> more<00:00:48.470> front

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
to adjust to using a lot more front

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.460 
to adjust to using a lot more front
brake<00:00:49.130> but<00:00:49.910> beyond<00:00:50.180> that<00:00:50.210> it's<00:00:51.079> not<00:00:51.230> going<00:00:51.410> to

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
brake but beyond that it's not going to

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.200 
brake but beyond that it's not going to
be<00:00:51.530> as<00:00:51.680> big<00:00:51.980> adjustment<00:00:52.430> and<00:00:52.550> so<00:00:52.940> if<00:00:53.060> you're

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
be as big adjustment and so if you're

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.690 
be as big adjustment and so if you're
coming<00:00:53.239> from<00:00:53.600> a<00:00:53.870> sport<00:00:54.649> bike<00:00:54.800> background<00:00:55.310> it's

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
coming from a sport bike background it's

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.770 
coming from a sport bike background it's
one<00:00:55.820> of<00:00:55.880> the<00:00:55.970> biggest<00:00:56.210> things<00:00:56.360> you'll<00:00:56.480> see<00:00:56.630> out

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
one of the biggest things you'll see out

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.389 
one of the biggest things you'll see out
here<00:00:56.989> and<00:00:57.230> I'll<00:00:57.350> demonstrate<00:00:57.560> this<00:00:57.950> later<00:00:58.190> on

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
here and I'll demonstrate this later on

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.610 
here and I'll demonstrate this later on
the<00:00:58.550> track<00:00:59.120> is<00:00:59.329> just<00:00:59.989> you<00:01:00.260> know<00:01:00.290> every

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
the track is just you know every

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.200 
the track is just you know every
instinct<00:01:01.010> you<00:01:01.040> have<00:01:01.130> the<00:01:01.460> sport<00:01:01.730> bike<00:01:01.880> riders

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
instinct you have the sport bike riders

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.520 
instinct you have the sport bike riders
to<00:01:02.360> lean<00:01:02.510> off<00:01:02.660> to<00:01:02.780> the<00:01:02.870> inside<00:01:03.200> of<00:01:03.320> the<00:01:03.380> bike

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
to lean off to the inside of the bike

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.139 
to lean off to the inside of the bike
which<00:01:04.070> is<00:01:04.100> great<00:01:04.339> when<00:01:04.520> you're<00:01:04.640> a<00:01:04.670> sport<00:01:04.940> bike

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:05.149 
which is great when you're a sport bike

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:06.999 
which is great when you're a sport bike
you're<00:01:05.509> leaning<00:01:05.630> off<00:01:05.840> to<00:01:05.960> the<00:01:06.050> inside<00:01:06.440> chin

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
you're leaning off to the inside chin

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:09.580 
you're leaning off to the inside chin
towards<00:01:07.460> the<00:01:07.520> corner<00:01:08.180> on<00:01:08.330> a<00:01:08.390> supermoto<00:01:09.320> bike

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
towards the corner on a supermoto bike

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:10.960 
towards the corner on a supermoto bike
you're<00:01:09.800> going<00:01:09.920> to<00:01:09.979> get<00:01:10.130> your<00:01:10.369> butt<00:01:10.550> cheek<00:01:10.790> to

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
you're going to get your butt cheek to

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.150 
you're going to get your butt cheek to
the<00:01:11.090> top<00:01:11.300> of<00:01:11.450> the<00:01:11.509> bike<00:01:11.720> so<00:01:12.410> the<00:01:12.590> most<00:01:12.740> common

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.160 
the top of the bike so the most common

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.820 
the top of the bike so the most common
thing<00:01:13.369> I<00:01:13.580> see<00:01:13.910> wrong<00:01:14.630> is<00:01:15.170> basically<00:01:15.560> will<00:01:15.800> be

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
thing I see wrong is basically will be

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.609 
thing I see wrong is basically will be
but<00:01:16.700> too<00:01:16.910> far<00:01:17.119> back<00:01:17.360> on<00:01:17.509> the<00:01:17.600> bike<00:01:17.780> shoulders

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
but too far back on the bike shoulders

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.559 
but too far back on the bike shoulders
hunched<00:01:18.950> down<00:01:18.979> and<00:01:19.399> then<00:01:19.820> leaning<00:01:20.180> off<00:01:20.300> to<00:01:20.450> the

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:20.569 
hunched down and then leaning off to the

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:22.300 
hunched down and then leaning off to the
wrong<00:01:20.840> side<00:01:21.080> so<00:01:21.649> basically<00:01:21.770> you'll<00:01:22.130> see

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
wrong side so basically you'll see

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.660 
wrong side so basically you'll see
riders<00:01:22.700> riding<00:01:23.270> around<00:01:23.539> like<00:01:23.979> so<00:01:24.979> the<00:01:25.100> fix<00:01:25.580> for

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
riders riding around like so the fix for

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:26.050 
riders riding around like so the fix for
this

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
this

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.150 
this
is<00:01:26.119> doing<00:01:26.780> our<00:01:26.929> which<00:01:27.679> is<00:01:27.709> part<00:01:28.039> of<00:01:28.069> the

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
is doing our which is part of the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.400 
is doing our which is part of the
introductory<00:01:28.490> talk<00:01:28.910> basically<00:01:29.660> getting<00:01:30.170> up

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
introductory talk basically getting up

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.980 
introductory talk basically getting up
on<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:30.619> up<00:01:31.190> on<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.399> tank<00:01:31.670> one<00:01:32.330> butt<00:01:32.569> cheek<00:01:32.600> to

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
on the up on the tank one butt cheek to

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.990 
on the up on the tank one butt cheek to
the<00:01:33.110> top<00:01:33.319> and<00:01:33.619> then<00:01:34.009> pushing<00:01:34.459> the<00:01:34.550> bike<00:01:34.729> down

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
the top and then pushing the bike down

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.900 
the top and then pushing the bike down
so<00:01:35.619> it's<00:01:36.619> basically<00:01:37.009> in<00:01:37.190> this<00:01:37.250> position<00:01:37.759> right

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
so it's basically in this position right

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.389 
so it's basically in this position right
here<00:01:38.200> we'll<00:01:39.200> have<00:01:39.319> another<00:01:39.560> series<00:01:40.280> that

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
here we'll have another series that

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.190 
here we'll have another series that
we're<00:01:40.520> talking<00:01:40.670> about<00:01:40.940> body<00:01:41.630> position<00:01:42.110> as

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
we're talking about body position as

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.320 
we're talking about body position as
well<00:01:42.350> but<00:01:42.890> just<00:01:43.069> in<00:01:43.160> general<00:01:43.220> that's<00:01:44.000> probably

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
well but just in general that's probably

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.330 
well but just in general that's probably
one<00:01:44.479> of<00:01:44.509> the<00:01:44.630> biggest<00:01:44.990> mistakes<00:01:45.770> next<00:01:46.190> one<00:01:46.310> I

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
one of the biggest mistakes next one I

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.300 
one of the biggest mistakes next one I
see<00:01:46.580> out<00:01:46.729> here<00:01:46.940> is<00:01:47.560> what<00:01:48.560> I<00:01:48.590> call<00:01:48.860> like<00:01:49.009> a<00:01:49.039> leg

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
see out here is what I call like a leg

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.940 
see out here is what I call like a leg
dangle<00:01:49.670> so<00:01:50.200> the<00:01:51.200> way<00:01:51.349> you<00:01:51.410> want<00:01:51.649> to<00:01:51.709> think<00:01:51.830> of

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
dangle so the way you want to think of

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.949 
dangle so the way you want to think of
your<00:01:52.130> foot<00:01:52.459> on<00:01:52.700> a<00:01:52.759> supermoto<00:01:53.390> bike<00:01:53.660> or<00:01:53.869> your

00:01:53.949 --> 00:01:53.959 
your foot on a supermoto bike or your

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:55.600 
your foot on a supermoto bike or your
boot<00:01:54.229> is<00:01:54.530> think<00:01:54.920> of<00:01:54.979> it<00:01:55.069> like<00:01:55.160> you<00:01:55.250> think<00:01:55.490> of<00:01:55.580> a

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
boot is think of it like you think of a

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:56.740 
boot is think of it like you think of a
nice<00:01:55.789> light<00:01:56.030> you're<00:01:56.270> not<00:01:56.360> just<00:01:56.509> going<00:01:56.599> to<00:01:56.660> be

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
nice light you're not just going to be

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.930 
nice light you're not just going to be
planting<00:01:57.259> your<00:01:57.380> foot<00:01:57.619> and<00:01:57.800> laying<00:01:58.459> on<00:01:58.700> it<00:01:58.849> the

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
planting your foot and laying on it the

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.880 
planting your foot and laying on it the
whole<00:01:59.060> time<00:01:59.119> you<00:02:00.020> basically<00:02:00.349> use<00:02:00.590> it<00:02:00.619> as<00:02:00.860> a

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
whole time you basically use it as a

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.589 
whole time you basically use it as a
little<00:02:01.160> feeler<00:02:01.610> gauge<00:02:01.849> when<00:02:02.330> you're<00:02:02.450> out

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:02.599 
little feeler gauge when you're out

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:04.359 
little feeler gauge when you're out
riding<00:02:02.869> just<00:02:03.440> like<00:02:03.649> you<00:02:03.740> use<00:02:03.890> your<00:02:04.160> knee

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
riding just like you use your knee

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:05.740 
riding just like you use your knee
sliders<00:02:04.700> a<00:02:04.849> feeler

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
sliders a feeler

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.050 
sliders a feeler
SportBike<00:02:07.190> what<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.220> find<00:02:08.459> is<00:02:08.580> that<00:02:08.610> riders

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
SportBike what I find is that riders

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.160 
SportBike what I find is that riders
even<00:02:09.209> though<00:02:09.420> they're<00:02:09.569> not<00:02:09.720> really<00:02:09.899> leaning

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
even though they're not really leaning

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.660 
even though they're not really leaning
the<00:02:10.349> bike<00:02:10.380> they<00:02:10.649> kind<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:10.979> want<00:02:11.130> to<00:02:11.220> feel<00:02:11.489> it

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
the bike they kind of want to feel it

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.430 
the bike they kind of want to feel it
out<00:02:11.760> so<00:02:12.209> what<00:02:12.360> you'll<00:02:12.480> see<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.780> see<00:02:13.110> riders

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
out so what you'll see you see riders

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.500 
out so what you'll see you see riders

out on the track you know kind of having

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.110 
out on the track you know kind of having
their<00:02:15.599> leg<00:02:15.810> like<00:02:16.050> this<00:02:16.290> out<00:02:16.560> to<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.950> side<00:02:17.160> to

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
their leg like this out to the side to

going to do is go knee up foot forward
just<00:02:29.610> a<00:02:29.730> little<00:02:29.760> bit<00:02:30.030> nothing<00:02:30.480> too<00:02:30.630> extreme

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
just a little bit nothing too extreme

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.040 
just a little bit nothing too extreme
just<00:02:31.739> up<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.280> forward<00:02:33.120> that's<00:02:33.569> going<00:02:33.810> to<00:02:33.870> take

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
just up and forward that's going to take

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.110 
just up and forward that's going to take
care<00:02:34.290> of<00:02:34.349> the<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:35.160> second<00:02:35.519> biggest<00:02:35.670> issue<00:02:35.940> the

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
care of the the second biggest issue the

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.479 
care of the the second biggest issue the
leg<00:02:36.780> Singhal<00:02:37.290> so<00:02:37.620> this<00:02:37.739> will<00:02:37.860> be<00:02:37.950> number<00:02:38.220> three

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
leg Singhal so this will be number three

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.900 
leg Singhal so this will be number three
is<00:02:38.870> riding<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:39.989> clutch<00:02:40.319> into<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.010> turn<00:02:41.220> on<00:02:41.489> a

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
is riding the clutch into the turn on a

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.970 
is riding the clutch into the turn on a
super<00:02:42.630> super<00:02:42.900> motor<00:02:43.049> bikes<00:02:43.230> have<00:02:43.410> awesome

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
super super motor bikes have awesome

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.610 
super super motor bikes have awesome
brakes<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.519> one<00:02:44.940> huge<00:02:45.390> part<00:02:45.720> of<00:02:45.989> the<00:02:46.290> braking

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
brakes and one huge part of the braking

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.920 
brakes and one huge part of the braking
is<00:02:46.920> all<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.910> engine<00:02:48.239> braking<00:02:48.450> that<00:02:48.660> you<00:02:48.750> have

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
is all the engine braking that you have

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.949 
is all the engine braking that you have
so<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.830> big<00:02:50.310> issue<00:02:50.489> with<00:02:50.819> riders<00:02:51.480> possibly

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
so a big issue with riders possibly

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:52.759 
so a big issue with riders possibly
because<00:02:52.110> they're<00:02:52.200> trying<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.410> keep<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.650> bike

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
because they're trying to keep the bike

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.470 
because they're trying to keep the bike
smooth<00:02:53.100> is<00:02:53.340> that<00:02:53.760> they'll<00:02:53.910> ride<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.330> clutch

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
smooth is that they'll ride the clutch

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.440 
smooth is that they'll ride the clutch
into<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:54.989> turn<00:02:55.230> so<00:02:55.799> you'll<00:02:55.950> watch<00:02:56.340> a<00:02:56.459> rider<00:02:56.670> go

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
into the turn so you'll watch a rider go

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.509 
into the turn so you'll watch a rider go
down<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:57.750> straightaway<00:02:58.260> they'll<00:02:59.069> get<00:02:59.280> on<00:02:59.400> the

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
down the straightaway they'll get on the

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.550 
down the straightaway they'll get on the
brakes<00:02:59.790> the<00:03:00.540> pull<00:03:00.840> in<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.049> clutch<00:03:01.080> and

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
brakes the pull in the clutch and

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.070 
brakes the pull in the clutch and
they'll<00:03:02.010> start<00:03:02.280> to<00:03:02.370> turn<00:03:02.670> in<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:03.239> then<00:03:03.810> only

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
they'll start to turn in and then only

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.259 
they'll start to turn in and then only
once<00:03:04.470> they're<00:03:04.680> in<00:03:04.799> the<00:03:04.890> turn<00:03:05.099> start<00:03:05.910> letting

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
once they're in the turn start letting

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.509 
once they're in the turn start letting
the<00:03:06.480> clutch<00:03:06.750> out<00:03:06.959> bikes<00:03:07.650> never<00:03:08.069> going<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.310> feel

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
the clutch out bikes never going to feel

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.310 
the clutch out bikes never going to feel
stable<00:03:08.849> you're<00:03:09.420> taking<00:03:09.720> away<00:03:09.810> all<00:03:10.079> that

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
stable you're taking away all that

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.720 
stable you're taking away all that
awesome<00:03:10.500> engine<00:03:10.980> braking<00:03:11.220> that<00:03:11.459> you<00:03:11.579> would

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
awesome engine braking that you would

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.569 
awesome engine braking that you would
have<00:03:12.049> so<00:03:13.049> in<00:03:13.290> short<00:03:13.650> just<00:03:14.160> make<00:03:14.370> sure<00:03:14.489> you

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
have so in short just make sure you

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.039 
have so in short just make sure you
don't<00:03:14.700> want<00:03:14.910> to<00:03:15.030> just<00:03:15.180> dump<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.690> clutch<00:03:15.810> out

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
don't want to just dump the clutch out

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.120 
don't want to just dump the clutch out
but<00:03:16.230> you<00:03:16.320> want<00:03:16.500> to<00:03:16.560> get<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.769> clutch<00:03:16.980> out

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
but you want to get the clutch out

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.000 
but you want to get the clutch out
relatively<00:03:17.760> smooth<00:03:18.390> and<00:03:18.660> relatively<00:03:19.019> fast<00:03:19.320> so

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
relatively smooth and relatively fast so

got guardrails all this so it's

apex and turn in too early so you're

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:51.620

really going to have to kind of

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.259 
really going to have to kind of
consciously<00:03:52.139> pick<00:03:52.500> a<00:03:52.680> late<00:03:52.920> in<00:03:53.100> later<00:03:53.730> turning

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
and a lot of times they'll put you out

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.470 
and a lot of times they'll put you out
in<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.430> track<00:04:02.700> where<00:04:02.940> there's<00:04:03.269> a<00:04:03.329> lot<00:04:03.450> of

gravel the cracks not too sticky one of
the<00:04:05.760> most<00:04:05.910> common<00:04:06.389> crashes<00:04:06.810> that<00:04:06.959> you'll<00:04:07.079> see

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
the most common crashes that you'll see

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.979 
the most common crashes that you'll see
is<00:04:07.739> riders<00:04:08.160> turning<00:04:08.579> too<00:04:08.700> early<00:04:09.000> that<00:04:09.180> pushes

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
is riders turning too early that pushes

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.599 
is riders turning too early that pushes
them<00:04:10.109> running<00:04:10.410> too<00:04:10.650> wide<00:04:10.920> in<00:04:11.100> the<00:04:11.190> turn<00:04:11.400> and

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
them running too wide in the turn and

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:13.280 
them running too wide in the turn and
then<00:04:11.730> they<00:04:11.880> try<00:04:12.209> to<00:04:12.269> adjust<00:04:12.510> their<00:04:12.900> turn<00:04:13.109> or

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
then they try to adjust their turn or

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.020 
then they try to adjust their turn or
adjust<00:04:13.590> their<00:04:13.739> line<00:04:13.949> without<00:04:14.639> getting<00:04:14.940> off

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
adjust their line without getting off

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.509 
adjust their line without getting off
the<00:04:15.150> throttle<00:04:15.359> or<00:04:15.600> getting<00:04:15.780> off<00:04:15.989> the<00:04:16.109> gas

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
the throttle or getting off the gas

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.069 
the throttle or getting off the gas
and<00:04:16.609> then<00:04:17.060> that's<00:04:17.269> where<00:04:17.509> you<00:04:17.539> know<00:04:17.870> you'll

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
and then that's where you know you'll

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.509 
and then that's where you know you'll
see<00:04:18.229> a<00:04:18.259> lot<00:04:18.410> of<00:04:18.440> high<00:04:18.620> sides<00:04:18.919> and<00:04:19.130> low<00:04:19.220> sides

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
see a lot of high sides and low sides

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.159 
see a lot of high sides and low sides
and<00:04:19.759> that<00:04:19.819> sort<00:04:20.120> of<00:04:20.180> thing<00:04:20.329> happen<00:04:20.720> the

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
and that sort of thing happen the

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.129 
and that sort of thing happen the
quickest<00:04:21.650> easiest<00:04:21.829> fix<00:04:22.610> for<00:04:22.819> this<00:04:22.910> is<00:04:23.090> you<00:04:24.020> do

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
quickest easiest fix for this is you do

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.219 
quickest easiest fix for this is you do
a<00:04:24.169> V<00:04:24.470> basically<00:04:25.069> come<00:04:25.580> in<00:04:25.789> make<00:04:26.300> a<00:04:26.330> nice<00:04:26.569> u<00:04:26.900> and

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229 
a V basically come in make a nice u and

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:29.589 
a V basically come in make a nice u and
then<00:04:27.560> exit<00:04:28.039> with<00:04:28.190> a<00:04:28.220> V<00:04:28.490> you're<00:04:29.060> doing<00:04:29.270> you<00:04:29.479> two

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:29.599 
then exit with a V you're doing you two

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:32.080 
then exit with a V you're doing you two
a<00:04:29.630> V<00:04:29.900> that's<00:04:30.740> a<00:04:30.830> good<00:04:30.979> way<00:04:31.250> to<00:04:31.310> go<00:04:31.550> provided<00:04:32.000> the

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
a V that's a good way to go provided the

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.969 
a V that's a good way to go provided the
turns<00:04:32.270> on<00:04:32.479> a<00:04:32.509> double<00:04:32.840> apex<00:04:33.199> and<00:04:33.500> provide<00:04:33.800> it's

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
turns on a double apex and provide it's

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:36.520 
turns on a double apex and provide it's
not<00:04:34.190> more<00:04:34.430> than<00:04:34.460> 180<00:04:35.180> degrees<00:04:35.569> that's<00:04:36.440> a

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
not more than 180 degrees that's a

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.830 
not more than 180 degrees that's a
really<00:04:36.889> good<00:04:37.009> way<00:04:37.190> to<00:04:37.270> just<00:04:38.270> start<00:04:38.509> just<00:04:38.720> to

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
really good way to just start just to

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.180 
really good way to just start just to
make<00:04:38.990> sure<00:04:39.110> that<00:04:39.289> you're<00:04:39.440> not<00:04:39.560> turning<00:04:39.830> in<00:04:40.039> too

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
make sure that you're not turning in too

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.080 
make sure that you're not turning in too
early<00:04:40.220> and<00:04:40.970> then<00:04:41.240> the<00:04:41.800> final<00:04:42.800> one<00:04:42.949> I<00:04:42.979> see<00:04:43.400> over

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
early and then the final one I see over

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.809 
early and then the final one I see over
and<00:04:44.180> over<00:04:44.300> again<00:04:44.389> and<00:04:44.780> this<00:04:45.110> is<00:04:45.259> part<00:04:45.500> of<00:04:45.530> the

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:45.819 
and over again and this is part of the

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:48.010 
and over again and this is part of the
smooth<00:04:46.819> input<00:04:47.180> stock<00:04:47.389> that<00:04:47.539> we<00:04:47.630> talked<00:04:47.810> about

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
smooth input stock that we talked about

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.779 
smooth input stock that we talked about
I<00:04:48.050> see<00:04:48.259> people<00:04:48.530> will<00:04:48.889> just<00:04:49.069> let<00:04:49.460> off<00:04:49.610> the<00:04:49.759> brake

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:49.789 
I see people will just let off the brake

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:51.850 
I see people will just let off the brake
immediately<00:04:50.659> so<00:04:51.110> they'll<00:04:51.289> come<00:04:51.440> in<00:04:51.590> down<00:04:51.740> the

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
immediately so they'll come in down the

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.159 
immediately so they'll come in down the
straightaway<00:04:52.479> they'll<00:04:53.479> get<00:04:53.630> on<00:04:53.750> the<00:04:53.900> brakes

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
straightaway they'll get on the brakes

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.860 
straightaway they'll get on the brakes
and<00:04:54.409> then<00:04:55.370> when<00:04:55.909> they<00:04:56.030> get<00:04:56.180> to<00:04:56.419> their<00:04:56.509> turning

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
and then when they get to their turning

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.629 
and then when they get to their turning
point<00:04:57.080> instead<00:04:57.590> of<00:04:57.650> tapering<00:04:58.099> off<00:04:58.250> the<00:04:58.400> brakes

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
point instead of tapering off the brakes

00:04:58.639 --> 00:04:59.950 
point instead of tapering off the brakes
you'll<00:04:58.880> watch<00:04:59.030> it<00:04:59.060> over<00:04:59.479> and<00:04:59.509> over<00:04:59.659> again

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
you'll watch it over and over again

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.899 
you'll watch it over and over again
they'll<00:05:00.380> just<00:05:00.560> unload<00:05:00.889> the<00:05:01.039> brakes<00:05:01.280> so<00:05:01.789> now

00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:01.909 
they'll just unload the brakes so now

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:03.219 
they'll just unload the brakes so now
you<00:05:01.970> have<00:05:02.150> an<00:05:02.240> issue<00:05:02.389> where<00:05:02.599> your<00:05:02.750> suspension

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
you have an issue where your suspension

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:05.529 
you have an issue where your suspension
is<00:05:03.349> unloading<00:05:03.830> at<00:05:03.949> the<00:05:04.340> exact<00:05:04.759> same<00:05:05.000> time<00:05:05.330> that

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
is unloading at the exact same time that

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:08.320 
is unloading at the exact same time that
you're<00:05:05.659> turning<00:05:05.840> in<00:05:06.639> so<00:05:07.639> the<00:05:07.909> answer<00:05:08.210> to<00:05:08.300> that

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
you're turning in so the answer to that

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.020 
you're turning in so the answer to that
is<00:05:08.690> we<00:05:08.930> talked<00:05:09.229> about<00:05:09.289> the<00:05:09.500> bell<00:05:09.650> curve<00:05:10.030> inputs

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
is we talked about the bell curve inputs

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.610 
is we talked about the bell curve inputs
in<00:05:11.210> our<00:05:11.330> other<00:05:11.449> video<00:05:11.870> just<00:05:12.319> make<00:05:12.470> sure<00:05:12.590> to

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
in our other video just make sure to

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.589 
in our other video just make sure to
taper<00:05:13.039> off<00:05:13.220> your<00:05:13.639> braking<00:05:14.060> just<00:05:14.300> like<00:05:14.449> you

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:14.599 
taper off your braking just like you

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:16.270 
taper off your braking just like you
roll<00:05:14.900> on<00:05:15.139> your<00:05:15.289> gas<00:05:15.500> just<00:05:15.830> like<00:05:16.009> you're<00:05:16.130> going

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
roll on your gas just like you're going

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.760 
roll on your gas just like you're going
to<00:05:16.370> taper<00:05:16.909> off<00:05:17.090> your<00:05:17.449> gas<00:05:17.630> same<00:05:18.319> thing<00:05:18.590> with

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
to taper off your gas same thing with

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.320 
to taper off your gas same thing with
your<00:05:18.949> brakes<00:05:19.580> did<00:05:19.789> you<00:05:19.880> come<00:05:20.030> in<00:05:20.150> on<00:05:20.240> the

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
your brakes did you come in on the

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.770 
your brakes did you come in on the
brakes

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
brakes

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:21.939 
brakes
instead<00:05:21.050> of<00:05:21.199> getting<00:05:21.380> on<00:05:21.440> the<00:05:21.530> brakes<00:05:21.800> and

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:21.949 
instead of getting on the brakes and

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:23.469 
instead of getting on the brakes and
then<00:05:22.039> just<00:05:22.250> being<00:05:22.370> done<00:05:22.639> with<00:05:22.820> it<00:05:22.969> and<00:05:23.000> dumping

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
then just being done with it and dumping

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:23.770 
then just being done with it and dumping
it

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
it

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.390 
it
make<00:05:24.110> sure<00:05:24.259> to<00:05:24.289> tape<00:05:24.620> or<00:05:24.800> your<00:05:24.919> brakes<00:05:25.099> off

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
make sure to tape or your brakes off

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.779 
make sure to tape or your brakes off
nice<00:05:25.699> and<00:05:25.729> slow<00:05:25.969> so<00:05:26.810> just<00:05:27.169> in<00:05:27.289> summary<00:05:27.789> the

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:28.789 
nice and slow so just in summary the

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:30.820 
nice and slow so just in summary the
five<00:05:29.120> most<00:05:29.419> common<00:05:29.659> mistakes<00:05:30.320> that<00:05:30.440> I<00:05:30.560> see<00:05:30.590> out

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
five most common mistakes that I see out

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.189 
five most common mistakes that I see out
here<00:05:31.190> one<00:05:31.699> would<00:05:31.849> be<00:05:32.000> but<00:05:32.509> to<00:05:32.659> the<00:05:32.750> wrong<00:05:32.930> side

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:33.199 
here one would be but to the wrong side

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:34.749 
here one would be but to the wrong side
of<00:05:33.320> the<00:05:33.380> by<00:05:33.530> cleaning<00:05:33.919> off<00:05:34.099> to<00:05:34.219> the<00:05:34.310> inside

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:34.759 
of the by cleaning off to the inside

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:37.060 
of the by cleaning off to the inside
second<00:05:35.719> one<00:05:35.840> would<00:05:35.990> be<00:05:36.050> the<00:05:36.259> leg<00:05:36.469> dangles<00:05:36.919> as

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
second one would be the leg dangles as

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.610 
second one would be the leg dangles as
they're<00:05:37.190> often<00:05:37.340> kind<00:05:37.759> of<00:05:37.849> closely<00:05:38.090> related

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
they're often kind of closely related

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.170 
they're often kind of closely related
third<00:05:39.620> would<00:05:39.889> be<00:05:39.919> riding<00:05:40.460> the<00:05:40.550> clutch<00:05:40.759> into

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
third would be riding the clutch into

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.930 
third would be riding the clutch into
the<00:05:41.300> turn<00:05:41.539> fourth<00:05:42.469> would<00:05:42.830> be<00:05:42.860> turning<00:05:43.550> in<00:05:43.669> too

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
the turn fourth would be turning in too

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.240 
the turn fourth would be turning in too
early<00:05:44.449> and<00:05:44.659> then<00:05:45.259> the<00:05:45.500> fifth<00:05:45.740> one<00:05:45.949> would<00:05:46.130> be

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
early and then the fifth one would be

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.770 
early and then the fifth one would be
just<00:05:46.280> you<00:05:47.000> know<00:05:47.090> getting<00:05:47.360> off<00:05:47.449> a<00:05:47.479> brake

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
just you know getting off a brake

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.749 
just you know getting off a brake
dumping<00:05:48.169> off<00:05:48.289> the<00:05:48.409> brake<00:05:48.590> instead<00:05:48.919> of<00:05:49.009> rolling

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:49.759 
dumping off the brake instead of rolling

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:52.360 
dumping off the brake instead of rolling
up<00:05:50.060> so<00:05:51.050> hopefully<00:05:51.530> if<00:05:51.860> you're<00:05:51.949> doing<00:05:52.190> those

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
up so hopefully if you're doing those

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.510 
up so hopefully if you're doing those
that'll<00:05:53.000> give<00:05:53.240> you<00:05:53.300> an<00:05:53.419> idea<00:05:53.539> that<00:05:54.050> of<00:05:55.039> what<00:05:55.370> to

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
that'll give you an idea that of what to

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:15.360 
that'll give you an idea that of what to
what<00:05:55.789> to<00:05:55.819> work<00:05:56.030> on<00:05:56.180> and<00:05:56.449> how<00:05:56.690> to<00:05:56.750> ride<00:05:56.960> better

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.430 

you
