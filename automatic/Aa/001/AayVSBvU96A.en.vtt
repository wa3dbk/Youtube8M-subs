morgue<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:21.740> I'm<00:00:22.740> going<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.010> be<00:00:23.130> combining

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
morgue and I'm going to be combining

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.550 
morgue and I'm going to be combining
this<00:00:23.820> was<00:00:24.060> something<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:24.420> I<00:00:24.510> want<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:24.930> do<00:00:25.170> to

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
this was something that I want to do to

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.250 
this was something that I want to do to
do<00:00:25.710> for<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.010> while<00:00:26.070> which<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.539> laser<00:00:27.960> pointer

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
do for a while which is a laser pointer

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.310 
do for a while which is a laser pointer
turret<00:00:28.890> so<00:00:29.760> basically<00:00:30.570> what<00:00:30.869> i'm<00:00:30.929> going<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.140> do

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
turret so basically what i'm going to do

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.810 
turret so basically what i'm going to do
is<00:00:31.529> have<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.489> laser<00:00:32.910> pointed<00:00:33.510> satellite<00:00:34.820> that

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
is have a laser pointed satellite that

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.680 
is have a laser pointed satellite that
is<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.840> uses<00:00:37.230> weapons<00:00:37.829> from<00:00:38.160> CES<00:00:38.700> they're

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
is that uses weapons from CES they're

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.450 
is that uses weapons from CES they're
probably<00:00:39.960> going<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.379> be<00:00:40.500> about<00:00:40.530> two<00:00:41.040> parts

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
probably going to be about two parts

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.250 
probably going to be about two parts
this<00:00:41.760> tutorial<00:00:42.030> don't<00:00:42.750> think<00:00:42.989> i'll<00:00:43.079> have

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
this tutorial don't think i'll have

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.250 
this tutorial don't think i'll have
enough<00:00:43.710> time<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.010> do<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.370> in<00:00:44.460> one<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.260> first

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
enough time to do it in one and first

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.380 
enough time to do it in one and first
part<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.649> going<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.829> be<00:00:46.890> like<00:00:47.100> for<00:00:47.399> second<00:00:48.180> part

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
part is going to be like for second part

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.840 
part is going to be like for second part
is<00:00:48.480> going<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.690> be<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.930> turret<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.850> hopefully

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
is going to be the turret and hopefully

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.660 
is going to be the turret and hopefully
you'll<00:00:51.030> like<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.300> out<00:00:51.629> Fleur<00:00:52.039> okay<00:00:53.039> so<00:00:53.100> go<00:00:53.610> to

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
you'll like it out Fleur okay so go to

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.000 
you'll like it out Fleur okay so go to
your<00:00:53.850> life<00:00:54.300> support<00:00:54.809> tab<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.710> what<00:00:55.860> we're

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
your life support tab this is what we're

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.220 
your life support tab this is what we're
going<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.219> be<00:00:56.250> using<00:00:56.309> for<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.910> most<00:00:57.090> part<00:00:57.329> c

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
going to be using for the most part c

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.700 
going to be using for the most part c
you<00:00:58.410> have<00:00:58.550> combat<00:00:59.550> damage<00:00:59.789> systems<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:01.469> seed

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
you have combat damage systems so seed

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.910 
you have combat damage systems so seed
yes<00:01:01.949> that's<00:01:02.850> what<00:01:03.180> says<00:01:03.449> their<00:01:03.719> life<00:01:04.500> support

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
yes that's what says their life support

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.200 
yes that's what says their life support
and<00:01:05.810> resource<00:01:06.810> distribution

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.649 

okay<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:09.990> go<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.010> generators<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.440> get<00:01:13.440> a

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
okay so go to generators and get a

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.520 
okay so go to generators and get a
fusion<00:01:15.659> generator<00:01:16.590> and

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
fusion generator and

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.530 

I'm<00:01:20.070> just<00:01:20.280> going<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.520> show<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.909> this<00:01:21.180> quickly

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
I'm just going to show you this quickly

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.290 
I'm just going to show you this quickly
and<00:01:21.869> then<00:01:23.780> i'll<00:01:24.780> actually<00:01:24.960> got<00:01:25.320> and

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
and then i'll actually got and

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.980 
and then i'll actually got and
a<00:01:26.560> little<00:01:27.560> kind<00:01:27.950> of<00:01:28.070> cheat<00:01:28.400> for<00:01:29.300> this<00:01:29.450> witch

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
a little kind of cheat for this witch

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.230 
a little kind of cheat for this witch
and<00:01:30.290> it's<00:01:30.650> a<00:01:30.770> bind<00:01:31.100> that<00:01:32.060> allows<00:01:32.570> me<00:01:32.840> to<00:01:34.240> change

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
and it's a bind that allows me to change

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.290 
and it's a bind that allows me to change
the<00:01:35.810> model<00:01:36.640> into<00:01:37.640> a<00:01:37.940> mini<00:01:38.660> CPA<00:01:39.230> so<00:01:39.950> you<00:01:40.040> have

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
the model into a mini CPA so you have

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.250 
the model into a mini CPA so you have
cool<00:01:41.300> and<00:01:41.480> compressor<00:01:42.160> an<00:01:43.160> air<00:01:43.400> compressor

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
cool and compressor an air compressor

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.060 
cool and compressor an air compressor
and<00:01:45.260> go<00:01:45.500> to<00:01:45.560> storage<00:01:45.980> devices<00:01:47.230> large<00:01:48.230> resource

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
and go to storage devices large resource

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.560 
and go to storage devices large resource
cash<00:01:50.140> put<00:01:51.140> that<00:01:51.320> there<00:01:51.560> so<00:01:52.430> basically<00:01:53.210> with

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
cash put that there so basically with

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.720 
cash put that there so basically with
resource<00:01:54.080> distribution<00:01:54.350> we<00:01:55.220> have<00:01:55.340> a<00:01:55.370> link

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
resource distribution we have a link

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.230 
resource distribution we have a link
tool<00:01:56.120> which<00:01:57.050> is<00:01:57.080> basically<00:01:57.830> like<00:01:58.010> wire<00:01:58.580> in<00:01:58.910> the

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
tool which is basically like wire in the

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.820 
tool which is basically like wire in the
sense<00:01:59.510> that<00:01:59.600> you're<00:01:59.930> linking<00:02:00.290> two<00:02:00.560> things

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
sense that you're linking two things

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.850 
sense that you're linking two things
together<00:02:01.180> so<00:02:02.180> if<00:02:02.330> you<00:02:02.540> link<00:02:02.930> the<00:02:03.140> fusion

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
together so if you link the fusion

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.680 
together so if you link the fusion
reactor<00:02:04.340> and<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:05.480> resource<00:02:06.380> is<00:02:06.680> any<00:02:07.690> coolant

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
reactor and the resource is any coolant

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.750 
reactor and the resource is any coolant
that's<00:02:09.110> in<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.590> resource<00:02:09.980> is<00:02:10.220> going<00:02:10.399> to<00:02:10.460> help

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
that's in the resource is going to help

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.260 
that's in the resource is going to help
the<00:02:11.480> fusion<00:02:11.960> reactor<00:02:12.440> and<00:02:12.620> any<00:02:13.550> energy<00:02:14.240> that

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
the fusion reactor and any energy that

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.020 
the fusion reactor and any energy that
the<00:02:14.810> fusion<00:02:15.230> reactor<00:02:15.650> produces<00:02:16.280> is<00:02:16.460> going<00:02:16.940> to

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
the fusion reactor produces is going to

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.170 
the fusion reactor produces is going to
go<00:02:17.090> into<00:02:17.240> this<00:02:17.540> to<00:02:18.050> make<00:02:18.200> these<00:02:18.440> run<00:02:18.680> so<00:02:19.370> if<00:02:20.030> I

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
go into this to make these run so if I

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.800 
go into this to make these run so if I
link<00:02:20.810> them<00:02:21.320> up

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.350 

see<00:02:25.410> there's<00:02:25.680> a<00:02:25.739> bit<00:02:25.980> of<00:02:26.069> energy<00:02:26.220> but<00:02:27.030> that's

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
see there's a bit of energy but that's

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.170 
see there's a bit of energy but that's
not<00:02:27.660> very<00:02:27.840> good<00:02:28.200> because<00:02:28.890> it's<00:02:29.670> make<00:02:30.000> that

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
not very good because it's make that

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.340 
not very good because it's make that
much<00:02:30.360> energy

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:39.490 

so<00:02:33.980> see<00:02:34.880> we've<00:02:35.090> got<00:02:35.120> cool<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:36.610> energy<00:02:37.610> I<00:02:38.500> know

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
so see we've got cool and energy I know

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.250 
so see we've got cool and energy I know
this<00:02:39.710> is<00:02:39.920> very<00:02:39.950> annoying<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:41.030> sound<00:02:41.330> so<00:02:41.930> go<00:02:42.200> to

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:20.420 

so<00:07:15.550> now

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:20.430 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.570 

oh<00:07:20.490> you<00:07:20.970> have<00:07:21.330> to<00:07:21.360> link<00:07:21.660> each<00:07:21.870> of<00:07:22.230> the

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:22.580 
oh you have to link each of the

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:27.400 
oh you have to link each of the
different<00:07:23.580> types<00:07:24.000> to<00:07:24.720> the<00:07:25.320> yellow<00:07:26.310> cash

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:27.410 
different types to the yellow cash

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:30.920 
different types to the yellow cash
otherwise<00:07:28.410> it<00:07:28.710> won't<00:07:28.890> work

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:30.930 
otherwise it won't work

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.469 
otherwise it won't work
so<00:07:31.530> there<00:07:31.740> we<00:07:31.860> have<00:07:31.889> it<00:07:32.070> we<00:07:32.580> could<00:07:32.820> use<00:07:33.180> edge

00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:33.479 
so there we have it we could use edge

00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:36.189 
so there we have it we could use edge
air<00:07:33.840> compressors<00:07:34.590> but<00:07:35.220> we<00:07:35.340> don't<00:07:35.550> need<00:07:35.759> to

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:36.199 
air compressors but we don't need to

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:40.850 
air compressors but we don't need to
because<00:07:37.199> we<00:07:38.160> have<00:07:38.400> all<00:07:38.820> the<00:07:39.000> stuff<00:07:39.180> we<00:07:39.360> need<00:07:39.860> so

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:40.860 
because we have all the stuff we need so

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:45.469 
because we have all the stuff we need so
