00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
wasn't a matter of now what would Jenny

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.420 
wasn't a matter of now what would Jenny
do<00:01:42.990> but<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.229> kind<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.680> felt<00:01:43.920> like<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.250> already

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
do but I kind of felt like I already

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.940 
do but I kind of felt like I already
knew<00:01:44.939> what<00:01:44.970> Jenny<00:01:45.329> would<00:01:45.540> do<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.680> goat

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950
