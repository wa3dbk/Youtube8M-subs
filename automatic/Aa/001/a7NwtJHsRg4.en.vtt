 gambling represents mark cerne figure 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.299
 famous and even legendary in some 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.850
 circles 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.600
 a veteran of the gaming industry he participated 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.699
 in development sonic the hedgehog 2 and 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.609
 among his latest achievements work 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.119
 over uncharted drake's damage he is ready to war 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.880
 3 and series resistor with special 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.550
 the launch of playstation 4 he created a nickname 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.160
 first brand project in which he was not 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.590
 only a designer but also a screenwriter and 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.230
 the director 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.230
 but not all the plot is simple and 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.989
 predictable actors in the Russian version 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.789
 replay and clearly do not understand the text 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.550
 send them something with a transmitter 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.399
 inside the graphics are cute but no more 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:02.940
 but most importantly to play often neg 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:06.000
 just boring isn't it too cool 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.549
 for walking the main character of the game golem 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.850
 consisting of magical artifacts 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.860
 relics they are left from some extinct 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.040
 civilization and in the game world serves 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.140
 main energy machine aircraft 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.320
 tanks and even vacuum cleaners 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.689
 work on energy relics aang 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.000
 this is a unique relic able to manage 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.310
 other relics and possessing 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.990
 own mind but the game 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.930
 refuses to disclose 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.479
 both sides of character 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.000
 nullify as soon as in conversation 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.780
 the hero opens his eyes to his true 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.390
 essence 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.189
 Nick deep in thought answers 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.820
 platitudes about loyalty and devotion 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:51.020
 and ends the conversation with a mighty blow to 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.729
 overly talkative opponents 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.950
 relic management comes down to what 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.799
 each level the main character starts 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.649
 little man finishes 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.140
 a giant destroying everything in its path 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.990
 if nick misses a beat and 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.690
 artifacts fall out of him and he 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.180
 slightly reduced in size but the player is not 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.910
 can significantly affect the size and 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.250
 neca even if you play very well or 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.989
 on the contrary very badly more or less 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.989
 from this he will not 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.849
 and another nickname really get bored 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.720
 it's not even that this is supposedly a game 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:36.239
 for children 5 years 2550 at any age 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.030
 boring to walk the same corridors 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.129
 one goblin beat button go 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.440
 treasure every time hidden behind 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:46.110
 some cracked wall and 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.780
 yet not even a child 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.750
 difficulty dying has to be very common 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.120
 even the slightest blow usually takes 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.730
 Immediately one-third of health and bosses and 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.859
 mini bosses almost always have a punch 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.870
 which is guaranteed to send a hero 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:03.120
 to the point of rebirth therefore 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:08.250
 get ready to go through some places 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:10.109
 8-10 times the only thing that saves 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.840
 game episodes when nick becomes 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:15.510
 a giant monster crushing than everything on 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.670
 on your way are formidable opponents now 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.180
 scatter in all directions from one 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.639
 hitting 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.159
 lampposts bend from one 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:23.849
 touches even at home are scattered on 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:25.609
 pieces 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.690
 of course the developers are trying 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:30.720
 balance it just as powerful 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.299
 opponents but completely cheating 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:37.319
 super hits allow you to return soon to 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:39.449
 destruction of private property nick 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:42.030
 looks like the peak of Sarov cartoon 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:42.840
 but actually more like a game 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.690
 based on 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.299
 where is pixar disney and dreamworks 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.819
 would make a sharp turn and turn 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:53.940
 would be a cartoon philosophical parable mark 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:56.489
 sir does not carry frank nonsense about that 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.129
 how people found an ancient sensible artifact 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.139
 and now uses his infinite power 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:03.750
 to switch levers 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:06.629
 get rid of goblins look for a long time 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:09.230
 lost sweethearts but most 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:11.970
 wicked upsetting failure to 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.599
 untapped potential interesting 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.510
 idea 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.739
 unexplored power of the new console and on 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.440
 exit yes yes 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:23.330
 funny but not more 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.330
 I ran away just ready
