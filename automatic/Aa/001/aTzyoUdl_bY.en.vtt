00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.880 
short this is short clips of him when he
gets<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.430> ball<00:00:23.460> I'm<00:00:24.000> not<00:00:24.630> showing<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.990> the

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
gets the ball I'm not showing the the

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.620 
gets the ball I'm not showing the the
kick<00:00:26.160> interpreters<00:00:26.640> at<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.029> very<00:00:27.180> first<00:00:27.420> one

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
kick interpreters at the very first one

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.109 
kick interpreters at the very first one
goes<00:00:27.810> first<00:00:28.080> timing<00:00:28.349> at<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.500> ball<00:00:28.680> but<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.820> just

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
goes first timing at the ball but I just

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.209 
goes first timing at the ball but I just
thought<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.929> high<00:00:31.109> school<00:00:31.439> was<00:00:31.980> not

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
thought that the high school was not

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.280 
thought that the high school was not
that<00:00:32.520> important<00:00:33.270> where<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:33.840> important

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
that important where it is important

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.290 
that important where it is important
it's<00:00:34.410> very<00:00:34.590> important<00:00:34.950> but<00:00:35.040> just<00:00:35.430> showing

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
it's very important but just showing

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.150 
it's very important but just showing
just<00:00:36.750> unnecessary<00:00:37.350> plays<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:37.950> punt

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
just unnecessary plays and the punt

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.540 
just unnecessary plays and the punt
returns<00:00:38.430> won't<00:00:38.670> really<00:00:38.790> help<00:00:39.000> my<00:00:39.260> my<00:00:40.550> choice

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
returns won't really help my my choice

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.380 
returns won't really help my my choice
or<00:00:42.180> my<00:00:43.010> draft<00:00:44.010> stock<00:00:44.340> it's<00:00:44.879> not<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.090> NFL's

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
or my draft stock it's not the NFL's

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.400 
or my draft stock it's not the NFL's
good<00:00:46.100> so<00:00:47.780> that's<00:00:48.780> why<00:00:48.870> I'm<00:00:48.989> only<00:00:49.110> showing<00:00:49.260> the

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
good so that's why I'm only showing the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.950 
good so that's why I'm only showing the
catches<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.039> I'll<00:00:50.160> probably<00:00:50.370> add<00:00:50.700> on<00:00:50.960> game

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
catches and I'll probably add on game

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.560 
catches and I'll probably add on game

you'll see one of them I put one of them
in<00:03:13.840> because<00:03:14.050> I<00:03:14.080> thought<00:03:14.200> it<00:03:14.350> was<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:14.500> most

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
in because I thought it was the most

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.260 
in because I thought it was the most
hilarious<00:03:15.489> and<00:03:17.340> so<00:03:18.340> I<00:03:18.610> didn't<00:03:19.000> want<00:03:19.120> to<00:03:19.180> put

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
hilarious and so I didn't want to put

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.240 
hilarious and so I didn't want to put
all<00:03:19.420> of<00:03:19.540> them<00:03:19.630> so<00:03:19.750> they<00:03:19.900> were<00:03:20.010> they<00:03:21.010> were<00:03:21.100> all

all of them so they were they were all

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.100 
all of them so they were they were all
pick<00:03:21.489> sixes<00:03:21.880> I<00:03:22.030> think<00:03:22.270> it's<00:03:22.570> that<00:03:22.660> word<00:03:22.870> I

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
pick sixes I think it's that word I

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.210 
pick sixes I think it's that word I
think

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
think

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.620 
think
that's<00:03:24.730> how<00:03:24.820> they<00:03:24.940> got<00:03:25.090> the<00:03:25.240> majority<00:03:25.360> of

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
that's how they got the majority of

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:32.010 
that's how they got the majority of
their<00:03:25.780> points<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:28.020> my<00:03:30.300> my<00:03:31.300> performance<00:03:31.900> in

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
their points and my my performance in

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.440 
their points and my my performance in
this<00:03:32.080> game<00:03:32.370> you'll<00:03:33.370> see<00:03:33.430> it's<00:03:33.850> it's<00:03:34.240> pretty

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
this game you'll see it's it's pretty

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.790 
this game you'll see it's it's pretty
spectacular<00:03:35.410> in<00:03:35.440> my<00:03:35.860> opinion<00:03:36.310> an<00:03:37.120> NFL<00:03:37.600> player

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
spectacular in my opinion an NFL player

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.130 
spectacular in my opinion an NFL player
an<00:03:38.800> NCAA<00:03:39.220> player<00:03:39.640> would<00:03:40.420> be<00:03:40.540> very<00:03:41.500> very

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
an NCAA player would be very very

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.140 
an NCAA player would be very very
excited<00:03:44.140> for<00:03:44.320> this<00:03:44.440> even<00:03:45.040> though<00:03:45.070> I<00:03:45.520> had<00:03:45.820> four

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
excited for this even though I had four

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.800 
excited for this even though I had four
dropped<00:03:46.480> passes<00:03:46.870> I<00:03:47.350> mean<00:03:48.310> it<00:03:49.150> depends<00:03:49.600> on<00:03:49.690> your

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
dropped passes I mean it depends on your

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.060 
dropped passes I mean it depends on your
quarterback<00:03:50.170> and<00:03:50.290> he<00:03:50.440> could<00:03:50.590> put<00:03:50.710> some<00:03:50.890> weird

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
quarterback and he could put some weird

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.130 
quarterback and he could put some weird
spin<00:03:51.490> on<00:03:51.640> the<00:03:51.730> ball<00:03:51.910> or<00:03:52.270> he<00:03:52.570> could<00:03:53.310> put<00:03:54.310> some

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
spin on the ball or he could put some

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.390 
spin on the ball or he could put some
well<00:03:56.140> he<00:03:56.350> could<00:03:56.470> just<00:03:56.590> do<00:03:56.650> anything<00:03:56.709> that's

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
well he could just do anything that's

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.340 
well he could just do anything that's
why<00:03:57.520> I'm<00:03:57.640> kind<00:03:58.240> of<00:03:58.330> trouble<00:03:58.630> thinking<00:03:59.200> about

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
why I'm kind of trouble thinking about

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.350 
why I'm kind of trouble thinking about
it<00:03:59.440> cuz<00:03:59.530> he<00:03:59.590> could<00:03:59.709> do<00:03:59.800> anything<00:04:00.240> with<00:04:01.240> the

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
it cuz he could do anything with the

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.410 
it cuz he could do anything with the
ball<00:04:01.570> in<00:04:01.810> there<00:04:02.110> it<00:04:02.380> could<00:04:02.530> just<00:04:03.270> they<00:04:04.270> could

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
ball in there it could just they could

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.860
