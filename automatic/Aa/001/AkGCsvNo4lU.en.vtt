00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.070
 I tried to explain about including Japan. 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.100
 In the 1990s, basically, 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.100
 I'm doing a book. 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.639
 To celebrate 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.639
 It is composed of such repulsion 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.970
 If the United States wants you to have an empty space 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.109
 Now I can revitalize the program. 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.599
 As an insurance company, I prepared to sell it as a shortcut example. 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.070
 Only one would eat salt water now. 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.560
 Application of the bride until 8 days 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.420
 I was surprised to see that it was work. 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.290
 In the middle of the movie debate 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.290
 On the 7th 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.540
 It will be long. Still cut 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.740
 I can school. 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.970
 I do not need to have an if icon 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.520
 You 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.590
 Capture and demonstrate 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.770
 - and this decision comes out as red 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.170
 Out 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.160
 Well-gone 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.410
 There's another way. 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.610
 Add an add something 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.610
 If you register 85 regulatory pools, you can see them all 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.500
 Knee keeps on doing this experiment and arts city 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.590
 Facebook 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.910
 It will be the fire of Jesus. 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.910
 Likewise, 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.630
 Disappeared 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.280
 Basically in mind 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.040
 sbs 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.430
 Because it is a product. 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.830
 In the state diagram 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.730
 Text message or already 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.480
 And through the process of making and releasing everything through giving 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.250
 What happened to Bush? 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.580
 See Pyeongtaek City 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.560
 When a product closes a product 1. 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.890
 If you push me 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.760
 I got 20 points 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.760
 The program is coming out 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.180
 j190 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.130
 And many different dogs are basically managed and 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.890
 Purchase software 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.259
 I can interpret how to hold my ankle. 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.519
 Even if the fan release is all 10 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:12.939
 The so-called so-called 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:15.599
 Press on the back plate of it 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.319
 If it is conservative, eventually 19 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:19.569
 If you can upload it 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.569
 I will become the br president 

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:28.409
 There is another one. 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.769
 I'm recording on the left and right, 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:36.509
 If you hit the office, 

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:39.069
 21 49 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.219
 If you raise your right foot, 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:43.249
 Zeroin executive director 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:44.409
