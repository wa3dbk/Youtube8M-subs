treatment sessions some colors do better
than<00:01:15.930> others<00:01:16.230> for<00:01:16.500> example<00:01:17.010> black<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.640> red

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850

responds more quickly Green's can be a

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.550 
responds more quickly Green's can be a
bit<00:01:20.820> slower<00:01:21.120> and<00:01:21.540> yellows<00:01:22.200> are<00:01:22.380> very

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
bit slower and yellows are very

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.470 
bit slower and yellows are very
difficult<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:23.070> remove<00:01:23.370> one<00:01:24.030> sees<00:01:24.330> an

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.480 
difficult to remove one sees an

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.170 
difficult to remove one sees an
immediate<00:01:24.960> reaction<00:01:25.580> when<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.610> laser<00:01:26.820> hits<00:01:27.120> a

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
immediate reaction when a laser hits a

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.750 
immediate reaction when a laser hits a
tattoo<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.409> only<00:01:28.680> responds<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:29.550> that

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
tattoo and it only responds on that

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.120 
tattoo and it only responds on that
tattoo<00:01:30.180> so<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.479> looks<00:01:30.780> like<00:01:30.979> almost<00:01:31.979> like

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
tattoo so it looks like almost like

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.280 
tattoo so it looks like almost like
you're<00:01:32.280> drawing<00:01:32.640> with<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.150> laser<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:34.260> remove

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
you're drawing with the laser to remove

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.260 
you're drawing with the laser to remove
like<00:01:34.950> someone's<00:01:35.340> name<00:01:35.520> for<00:01:35.760> example<00:01:35.850> when

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
like someone's name for example when

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.820 
like someone's name for example when
you're<00:01:36.390> not<00:01:36.570> you're<00:01:37.260> treating<00:01:37.620> the<00:01:37.710> whole

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
you're not you're treating the whole

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.250 
you're not you're treating the whole
area<00:01:38.250> but<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.970> laser<00:01:39.180> only<00:01:39.750> affects<00:01:40.170> the

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
area but the laser only affects the

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.680 
area but the laser only affects the
tattoo<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.100> doesn't<00:01:41.820> affect<00:01:42.570> the

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
tattoo and doesn't affect the

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.810 
tattoo and doesn't affect the
surrounding<00:01:43.080> skin<00:01:43.310> everybody<00:01:44.310> wants<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.700> know

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
surrounding skin everybody wants to know

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.149 
surrounding skin everybody wants to know
how<00:01:45.330> many<00:01:45.390> treatments<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.290> what<00:01:46.440> the<00:01:46.620> typical

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
how many treatments and what the typical

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.800 
how many treatments and what the typical
number<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.580> treatments<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.150> and<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.479> answer

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
number of treatments is and the answer

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.870 
number of treatments is and the answer
is<00:01:48.930> there's<00:01:49.170> no<00:01:49.380> typical<00:01:49.799> tattoo<00:01:50.430> at<00:01:50.729> the

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
is there's no typical tattoo at the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.210 
is there's no typical tattoo at the
moment<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.510> what<00:01:52.260> I<00:01:52.290> mean<00:01:52.560> by<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:53.190> that

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
moment and what I mean by that is that

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.520 
moment and what I mean by that is that
there<00:01:53.729> are<00:01:53.820> tattoos<00:01:54.330> that<00:01:54.510> are<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.900> place<00:01:55.200> by
