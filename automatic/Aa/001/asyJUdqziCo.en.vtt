here's a brief practical example that

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:04.870 
here's a brief practical example that
will<00:00:03.050> illustrate<00:00:03.230> some<00:00:03.889> core<00:00:04.160> concepts<00:00:04.729> about

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:04.880 
will illustrate some core concepts about

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.719 
will illustrate some core concepts about

referred to as springness position from
there<00:00:13.460> step<00:00:13.850> forward<00:00:14.180> as<00:00:14.300> far<00:00:14.480> as<00:00:14.540> you<00:00:14.720> can

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:14.870 
there step forward as far as you can

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.450 
there step forward as far as you can
reach<00:00:15.140> while<00:00:15.440> keeping<00:00:15.830> your<00:00:15.980> other<00:00:16.160> foot<00:00:16.430> on

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
reach while keeping your other foot on

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.520 
reach while keeping your other foot on
the<00:00:16.610> ground<00:00:16.900> what<00:00:17.900> do<00:00:18.020> you<00:00:18.110> notice<00:00:18.320> about

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:18.530 
the ground what do you notice about

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.330 
the ground what do you notice about
stepping<00:00:18.980> onto<00:00:19.280> your<00:00:19.550> heel<00:00:19.760> like<00:00:19.970> this<00:00:21.340> one

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
stepping onto your heel like this one

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.950 
stepping onto your heel like this one
thing<00:00:22.580> to<00:00:22.760> note<00:00:22.940> is<00:00:23.150> that<00:00:23.180> the<00:00:23.449> joints<00:00:23.840> are

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
thing to note is that the joints are

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.830 
thing to note is that the joints are
stiff<00:00:24.080> and<00:00:24.470> locked<00:00:25.240> start<00:00:26.240> to<00:00:26.420> rock<00:00:26.570> back<00:00:26.810> and

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
stiff and locked start to rock back and

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.930 
stiff and locked start to rock back and
forth<00:00:27.199> do<00:00:28.130> you<00:00:28.220> notice<00:00:28.430> that<00:00:28.609> your

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:28.940 
forth do you notice that your

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.880 
forth do you notice that your
outstretched<00:00:29.390> leg<00:00:29.779> is<00:00:29.960> what's<00:00:30.320> stopping<00:00:30.830> the

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
outstretched leg is what's stopping the

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.259 
outstretched leg is what's stopping the
forward<00:00:31.220> motion<00:00:33.010> if<00:00:34.010> you<00:00:34.249> heel<00:00:34.489> strike<00:00:34.879> the

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:35.269 
forward motion if you heel strike the

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:37.479 
forward motion if you heel strike the
braking<00:00:35.659> effect<00:00:35.929> must<00:00:36.319> be<00:00:36.440> overcome<00:00:36.769> on<00:00:37.159> every

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
braking effect must be overcome on every

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.969 
braking effect must be overcome on every
step<00:00:37.789> that's<00:00:38.479> okay<00:00:38.839> for<00:00:38.899> a<00:00:39.079> few<00:00:39.170> steps<00:00:39.589> but

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:39.979 
step that's okay for a few steps but

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:41.680 
step that's okay for a few steps but
think<00:00:40.249> about<00:00:40.370> the<00:00:40.609> compounding<00:00:41.210> effect<00:00:41.510> of

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
think about the compounding effect of

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.209 
think about the compounding effect of
