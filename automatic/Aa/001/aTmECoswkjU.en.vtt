00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.269

 endured or now yes that more than anything 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.110

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.450

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.740
 representations before this the 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.350

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.660
 among them that susana zabaleta had 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.220
 problems with floors ochoa however to 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.460
 the time to ask the actress 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.080
 it seems I think how now it touches the subject 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.080
 I'm going to talk about that, thank you very much 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.390
 with permission because environment because it 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:53.280
 I just got the happy and the wonderful 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.050
 incredible why that father on his part 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.559
 very much asked not to invent stories to the 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.559
 respect 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.119
 I had not want 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:10.960
 I did not know if there were doubts in what 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.850
 cost is that several several 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.850
 things to note that there was the 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.380
 another the other work already bought to this 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.090
 work that had to be rented again 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.560
 production another year and you had to 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.660
 decide from before you do not decide to 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.450
 time and point like that but that's how it happened 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.860
 nothing else happens and how it was more than 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.780
 obvious its bad relation 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.790
 Susana made it very clear that she was not 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.190
 the culprit that this work reaches its 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.050
 I'm not so important as to 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.200
 that the work is finished or could have 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.880
 brought another mortice no no no no no me 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.670
 put in a position where you do not 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.340
 I can answer because not because 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.780
 they are not strong was when you 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.820
 we questioned the actor if he could 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.200
