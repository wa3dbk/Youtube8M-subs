Kenya<00:01:21.090> go<00:01:21.360> for<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> run<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.990> you'll<00:01:22.170> quickly

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
Kenya go for a run and you'll quickly

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.270 
Kenya go for a run and you'll quickly
understand<00:01:23.900> so<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.500> how<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.710> goldmine

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
understand so this is how the goldmine

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.920 
understand so this is how the goldmine
expedition<00:01:26.880> look<00:01:27.060> like<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.540> some<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:27.840> you

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
expedition look like and some of you

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.950 
expedition look like and some of you
might<00:01:28.170> be<00:01:28.200> thinking<00:01:28.380> now<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.960> secret

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
might be thinking now that the secret

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.630 
might be thinking now that the secret
behind<00:01:31.110> these<00:01:31.470> gold<00:01:31.799> mines<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.310> why<00:01:32.460> they

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
behind these gold mines and why they

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.450 
behind these gold mines and why they
outperform<00:01:33.299> everybody<00:01:33.750> else<00:01:33.990> comes<00:01:34.979> down<00:01:35.189> to

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
outperform everybody else comes down to

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.450 
outperform everybody else comes down to
a<00:01:35.490> genetic<00:01:36.090> advantage<00:01:36.890> the<00:01:37.890> problem<00:01:38.340> with

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
methodology is based on one simple

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.800 
methodology is based on one simple
principle<00:03:37.150> what<00:03:38.150> you<00:03:38.300> see

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
principle what you see

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.250 
principle what you see
it's<00:03:39.170> not<00:03:39.440> what<00:03:39.650> you<00:03:39.740> get<00:03:40.150> so<00:03:41.150> imagine<00:03:42.140> you

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
it's not what you get so imagine you

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.720 
it's not what you get so imagine you
have<00:03:42.290> two<00:03:42.620> sprinters<00:03:43.070> you<00:03:43.160> have<00:03:43.310> one<00:03:43.520> running

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
have two sprinters you have one running

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.330 
have two sprinters you have one running
10.2<00:03:44.600> under<00:03:44.840> 100<00:03:45.230> meter<00:03:45.410> and<00:03:45.740> you<00:03:46.190> have

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
10.2 under 100 meter and you have

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.540 
10.2 under 100 meter and you have
another<00:03:46.580> one<00:03:46.820> running<00:03:47.020> 10.6<00:03:48.130> so<00:03:49.130> who's<00:03:49.340> the

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
another one running 10.6 so who's the

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
another one running 10.6 so who's the
most<00:03:49.670> talented<00:03:50.330> here<00:03:51.640> 98%<00:03:52.640> of<00:03:52.820> the<00:03:53.300> world's

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570

most talented here 98% of the world's
athletic<00:03:54.110> Coaches<00:03:54.470> would<00:03:54.860> bet<00:03:55.070> their<00:03:55.280> money

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
athletic Coaches would bet their money

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.100 
athletic Coaches would bet their money
on<00:03:55.610> the<00:03:55.730> 10<00:03:55.910> -<00:03:56.120> guy<00:03:56.300> because<00:03:56.720> he's<00:03:56.900> obviously

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
on the 10 - guy because he's obviously

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.230 
on the 10 - guy because he's obviously
the<00:03:57.920> fastest<00:03:58.400> and<00:03:58.550> therefore<00:03:59.000> the<00:03:59.090> most

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.240 
the fastest and therefore the most

the fastest and therefore the most
talented

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.340 
the least we love this story about the

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.140 
the least we love this story about the
lonely<00:06:19.520> genius<00:06:20.150> living<00:06:20.900> in<00:06:21.110> his<00:06:21.290> ivory<00:06:21.830> tower

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150 
lonely genius living in his ivory tower

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.850 
lonely genius living in his ivory tower
isolated<00:06:23.150> from<00:06:23.300> the<00:06:23.450> rest<00:06:23.480> of<00:06:23.780> the<00:06:23.870> world<00:06:24.080> but

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:24.860 
isolated from the rest of the world but

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.710 
isolated from the rest of the world but
I<00:06:24.890> don't<00:06:25.070> believe<00:06:25.490> that<00:06:25.520> the<00:06:25.910> lonely<00:06:26.270> genius

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 
I don't believe that the lonely genius

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.400 
I don't believe that the lonely genius

I<00:06:40.440> love<00:06:41.310> this<00:06:41.460> quote<00:06:41.700> from<00:06:41.760> TS<00:06:42.420> Eliot<00:06:42.840> he<00:06:42.990> says

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:43.140 
I love this quote from TS Eliot he says

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.960 
I love this quote from TS Eliot he says
the<00:06:43.290> great<00:06:43.500> ages<00:06:43.920> did<00:06:44.130> not<00:06:44.250> contain<00:06:44.730> more

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:44.970 
the great ages did not contain more

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:47.930 
the great ages did not contain more
talent<00:06:45.390> but<00:06:45.510> they<00:06:45.570> wasted<00:06:46.200> less<00:06:46.350> and<00:06:46.820> that's<00:06:47.820> a

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:47.940 
talent but they wasted less and that's a

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.790 
talent but they wasted less and that's a
very<00:06:48.150> powerful<00:06:48.420> message<00:06:48.720> because<00:06:49.470> it

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 
very powerful message because it

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.500 
very powerful message because it
suggests<00:06:50.610> that<00:06:50.730> talent<00:06:51.300> is<00:06:51.450> really

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:51.510 
suggests that talent is really

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:55.070 
suggests that talent is really
everywhere<00:06:52.440> and<00:06:52.800> our<00:06:53.550> job<00:06:53.910> as<00:06:54.060> a<00:06:54.150> society<00:06:54.870> and

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.080 
everywhere and our job as a society and

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.090 
everywhere and our job as a society and
as<00:06:55.500> a<00:06:55.530> culture<00:06:55.830> is<00:06:56.310> to<00:06:56.820> waste<00:06:57.060> less<00:06:57.270> genius<00:06:58.170> one

00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.100 
as a culture is to waste less genius one

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.950 
as a culture is to waste less genius one
way<00:06:59.280> of<00:06:59.430> doing<00:06:59.730> that<00:06:59.880> is<00:07:00.390> to<00:07:00.720> really

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960 
way of doing that is to really

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.230 
way of doing that is to really
understand<00:07:01.590> the<00:07:01.800> secrets<00:07:02.250> of<00:07:02.430> these<00:07:02.970> gold

understand the secrets of these gold

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.080 
understand the secrets of these gold
mines<00:07:03.450> if<00:07:03.660> we<00:07:03.870> do<00:07:04.020> that<00:07:04.170> I<00:07:04.410> believe<00:07:05.160> we<00:07:05.910> can

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.090 
mines if we do that I believe we can

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:08.510 
mines if we do that I believe we can
learn<00:07:06.210> how<00:07:06.480> to<00:07:06.510> build<00:07:06.840> our<00:07:07.410> own<00:07:07.740> gold<00:07:08.040> mines<00:07:08.280> of
