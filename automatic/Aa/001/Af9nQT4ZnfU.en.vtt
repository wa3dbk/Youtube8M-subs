00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
it is this laser here now this retails

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.950 
it is this laser here now this retails
here<00:00:11.429> in<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.610> UK<00:00:12.000> at<00:00:13.370> 450<00:00:14.370> pounds<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:15.660> I<00:00:15.780> got

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
here in the UK at 450 pounds and I got

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.550 
here in the UK at 450 pounds and I got
it<00:00:16.020> myself<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:17.720> based<00:00:18.720> on<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:18.990> technology

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
it myself so based on the technology

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.740 
it myself so based on the technology
that<00:00:19.800> we<00:00:19.980> see<00:00:20.279> in<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.850> demo<00:00:21.060> tala<00:00:21.300> gists

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
that we see in the demo tala gists

office this offers an at-home use for
now<00:00:25.350> there<00:00:25.500> are<00:00:25.590> several<00:00:25.800> lasers<00:00:26.250> on<00:00:26.430> the

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
now there are several lasers on the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.980 
now there are several lasers on the
market<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.000> are<00:00:27.119> also<00:00:27.240> very<00:00:27.390> similar<00:00:27.779> to

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
market that are also very similar to

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.050 
market that are also very similar to
this<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.859> reason<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.279> picked<00:00:29.460> this<00:00:29.550> one<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:29.939> I

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
this the reason I picked this one is I

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.669 
this the reason I picked this one is I
have<00:00:30.330> one<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.750> other<00:00:30.779> ones<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.349> I

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
have one of the other ones and I

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.860 
have one of the other ones and I
couldn't<00:00:32.040> use<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.489> mainly<00:00:32.910> because<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.660> left

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
couldn't use it mainly because it left

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.950 
couldn't use it mainly because it left
my<00:00:34.050> skin<00:00:34.320> very<00:00:34.710> very<00:00:35.070> dry<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.960> continuously

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
my skin very very dry and continuously

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.420 
my skin very very dry and continuously
left<00:00:37.260> my<00:00:37.440> skin<00:00:37.710> dry<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.760> was<00:00:38.910> never<00:00:40.430> able

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
left my skin dry that it was never able

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.940 
left my skin dry that it was never able
to<00:00:41.700> recover<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.510> speak<00:00:42.750> now<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.530> lot<00:00:43.860> of

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
to recover so to speak now a lot of

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.260 
to recover so to speak now a lot of
people<00:00:44.219> said<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.579> they<00:00:44.789> were<00:00:44.850> having<00:00:45.180> the

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
people said that they were having the

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.520 
people said that they were having the
same<00:00:45.450> issues<00:00:45.780> with<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:46.079> which<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.350> why<00:00:46.500> I

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
same issues with it which is why I

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.160 
same issues with it which is why I
couldn't<00:00:47.010> continue<00:00:47.399> with<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.170> application

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
couldn't continue with the application

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.260 
couldn't continue with the application
because<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.399> was<00:00:50.489> always<00:00:50.640> doing<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:51.000> around<00:00:51.090> the

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
because I was always doing it around the

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.959 
because I was always doing it around the
eye<00:00:51.300> area<00:00:51.829> no<00:00:52.829> amount<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.129> moisturizer<00:00:53.579> could

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
eye area no amount of moisturizer could

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.819 
eye area no amount of moisturizer could
just<00:00:54.149> really<00:00:54.449> make<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.750> area<00:00:55.110> feel<00:00:55.440> smooth

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
just really make that area feel smooth

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.490 
just really make that area feel smooth
again<00:00:56.180> whereas<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.360> works<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.289> same

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
again whereas this works in the same

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.950 
again whereas this works in the same
principle<00:00:58.980> but<00:00:59.160> did<00:00:59.760> not<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.270> has<00:01:00.570> not<00:01:00.780> left

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
principle but did not and has not left

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.170 
principle but did not and has not left
my<00:01:01.109> skin<00:01:01.379> dried<00:01:01.649> or<00:01:01.829> it's<00:01:02.250> too<00:01:02.520> early<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:03.000> say

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
my skin dried or it's too early to say

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.270 
my skin dried or it's too early to say
this<00:01:03.510> worked<00:01:03.780> however<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.619> backed<00:01:04.979> by

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
this worked however it is backed by

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.850 
this worked however it is backed by
science<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.270> there<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.110> no<00:01:07.350> doubt<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.619> this

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
science and there is no doubt that this

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.350 
science and there is no doubt that this
product<00:01:08.250> will<00:01:08.520> work<00:01:08.820> if<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.270> use

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
product will work if you use

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.660 
product will work if you use
consistently<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.159> very<00:01:11.430> key

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
consistently and that is a very key

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.550 
consistently and that is a very key
point<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.119> will<00:01:12.240> need<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.570> use<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:12.930> five

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
point you will need to use this five

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.420 
point you will need to use this five
days<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.860> week

now what you do is you place it on to
the<00:01:33.240> skin<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:34.020> releases<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.680> beam<00:01:34.920> of

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
the skin and it releases a beam of

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.550 
the skin and it releases a beam of
energy<00:01:35.240> that<00:01:36.240> stimulates<00:01:36.840> this<00:01:37.049> collagen

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
energy that stimulates this collagen

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.850 
energy that stimulates this collagen
production<00:01:38.060> under<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.180> skin<00:01:39.439> so<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.650> place

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
production under the skin so you place

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.550 
production under the skin so you place
it<00:01:41.009> on<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.189> area<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.490> want<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.759> treat<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.659> it

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
it on the area you want to treat and it

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.840 
it on the area you want to treat and it
makes<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:43.860> noise<00:01:44.070> telling<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.700> it's

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
makes this noise telling you that it's

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:52.609 
makes this noise telling you that it's
working<00:01:49.939> now<00:01:50.970> don't<00:01:51.840> let<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.140> fact<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.470> I

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
working now don't let the fact that I
