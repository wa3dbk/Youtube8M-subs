00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:52.660
 ground of the Monaco ace in all the 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.989
 sense of the word and it is he who opens the 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.940
 score 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.269

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:06.050
 41st minute of play opens the score 1-0 and 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.070
 peter berg this guy was a little bit 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.300
 near in so-called sensitive camps and 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.830
 collects just now the crisis is 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.400
 applied only to straighten the ball 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.400
 Perfectly 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.850
 really said once again to this 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.350
 price there that can give sonny anderson 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.789
 which is past that is the correct check to it 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.130
 the good exit of the young guard and 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:26.509

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:04.680

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.349
 the balloon because at sonny anderson 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.190
 almost a crime of lèse majesté in front of 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.190
