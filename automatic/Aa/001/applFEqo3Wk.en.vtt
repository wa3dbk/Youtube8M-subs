says that when she was first reading
about<00:02:34.079> it<00:02:34.230> somebody<00:02:34.469> described<00:02:35.040> it<00:02:35.189> as<00:02:35.310> being

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
about it somebody described it as being

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.880 
about it somebody described it as being
a<00:02:35.730> cross<00:02:35.909> between<00:02:36.060> apple<00:02:36.930> pie<00:02:37.079> and<00:02:37.230> cognac<00:02:37.439> and

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
a cross between apple pie and cognac and

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.670 
a cross between apple pie and cognac and
I<00:02:38.549> would<00:02:39.090> say<00:02:39.299> that<00:02:39.599> rather<00:02:39.900> than<00:02:40.019> the<00:02:40.260> apple

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
I would say that rather than the apple

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.920 
I would say that rather than the apple
pie<00:02:40.829> it's<00:02:41.730> more<00:02:41.909> like<00:02:42.060> raisin<00:02:42.480> pie<00:02:42.629> but

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
pie it's more like raisin pie but

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.780 
pie it's more like raisin pie but
there's<00:02:43.140> definitely<00:02:43.379> that<00:02:44.010> kind<00:02:44.040> of<00:02:44.370> very

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
there's definitely that kind of very

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.599 
there's definitely that kind of very
sweet<00:02:45.269> rich<00:02:45.930> booze<00:02:46.260> aspect<00:02:47.040> in<00:02:47.220> there<00:02:47.400> and

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:47.609 
sweet rich booze aspect in there and

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:49.699 
sweet rich booze aspect in there and
then<00:02:48.060> there's<00:02:48.269> also<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:48.599> little<00:02:48.810> bit<00:02:48.900> of<00:02:49.109> almond

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
then there's also a little bit of almond

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.020 
then there's also a little bit of almond
in<00:02:49.980> there<00:02:50.310> so<00:02:50.609> it's<00:02:51.709> certainly<00:02:52.709> edible<00:02:53.430> it's

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
in there so it's certainly edible it's

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.479 
in there so it's certainly edible it's
certainly<00:02:54.659> sniffle<00:02:55.470> when<00:02:55.709> you<00:02:55.829> when<00:02:56.189> it's<00:02:56.310> on
