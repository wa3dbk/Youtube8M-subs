00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.190 
and covering the coast
I<00:04:38.910> would<00:04:39.090> fluctuate<00:04:39.540> in<00:04:39.630> position<00:04:40.020> several

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
I would fluctuate in position several

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
and back again and the cars were fast I

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.490 
and back again and the cars were fast I
would<00:04:44.880> get<00:04:45.030> in<00:04:45.120> some<00:04:45.270> accidents<00:04:45.840> but<00:04:46.080> only<00:04:46.260> be

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
would get in some accidents but only be

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.170 
would get in some accidents but only be
boosted<00:04:46.950> back<00:04:47.130> into<00:04:47.400> the<00:04:47.490> race<00:04:47.640> for<00:04:47.820> reasons<00:04:48.090> I

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
boosted back into the race for reasons I

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.820 
boosted back into the race for reasons I
didn't<00:04:48.450> understand<00:04:48.930> it<00:04:49.230> wasn't<00:04:49.470> difficult

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
didn't understand it wasn't difficult

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.470 
didn't understand it wasn't difficult
and<00:04:49.980> it<00:04:50.040> wasn't<00:04:50.190> easy<00:04:50.430> and<00:04:50.790> I<00:04:51.090> kept<00:04:51.300> going

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
and it wasn't easy and I kept going

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.510 
and it wasn't easy and I kept going
because<00:04:51.690> I<00:04:51.930> was<00:04:52.050> there<00:04:52.320> and<00:04:52.500> the<00:04:53.130> world<00:04:53.340> was<00:04:53.490> a

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
to change Francisco's journey didn't end

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.130 
to change Francisco's journey didn't end
when<00:05:05.280> he<00:05:05.400> died<00:05:05.580> it<00:05:06.090> didn't<00:05:06.450> end<00:05:06.600> when<00:05:06.780> I<00:05:06.810> flew

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
when he died it didn't end when I flew

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.050 
when he died it didn't end when I flew
of<00:05:07.320> his<00:05:07.470> plane<00:05:07.770> into<00:05:07.980> a<00:05:08.100> bridge<00:05:08.400> several<00:05:08.820> times

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.580 
of his plane into a bridge several times
for<00:05:09.390> when<00:05:09.510> I<00:05:09.540> accidentally<00:05:10.080> entered<00:05:10.320> a<00:05:10.410> death

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590

for when I accidentally entered a death
match<00:05:10.830> those<00:05:11.280> times<00:05:11.550> were<00:05:11.760> instanced<00:05:12.330> and

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
match those times were instanced and

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.240 
match those times were instanced and

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.800

biggest difference was that he was

biggest difference was that he was

00:05:45.619 --> 00:05:45.629 
would not mean the end as many times as

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:47.299 
would not mean the end as many times as

he could die his existence would not
