UCLA for my psychiatric residency so
I've<00:00:38.300> gone<00:00:38.540> through<00:00:38.600> 14<00:00:39.530> years<00:00:39.920> of<00:00:40.250> medical

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
I've gone through 14 years of medical

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.930 
I've gone through 14 years of medical
training<00:00:41.000> which<00:00:41.780> is<00:00:41.989> linear<00:00:42.470> and<00:00:42.800> logical<00:00:43.610> and

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
training which is linear and logical and

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.610 
training which is linear and logical and
rational<00:00:44.360> and<00:00:44.989> I<00:00:45.950> learned<00:00:46.280> about<00:00:46.880> energy<00:00:47.210> and

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
rational and I learned about energy and

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.200 
rational and I learned about energy and
relationships<00:00:48.620> from<00:00:48.920> the<00:00:48.980> standpoint<00:00:49.910> of

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
relationships from the standpoint of

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.500 
relationships from the standpoint of
linear<00:00:50.630> science<00:00:51.170> and<00:00:51.590> what<00:00:52.370> I<00:00:52.399> learned<00:00:52.760> was

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
linear science and what I learned was

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.830 
linear science and what I learned was
that<00:00:53.570> we<00:00:54.290> can<00:00:54.469> get<00:00:54.649> energy<00:00:54.890> from<00:00:55.850> diet<00:00:56.300> we<00:00:56.630> can

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
that we can get energy from diet we can

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.110 
that we can get energy from diet we can
get<00:00:56.989> energy<00:00:57.170> from<00:00:57.620> exercise<00:00:58.399> we<00:00:58.790> can<00:00:58.940> get

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
get energy from exercise we can get

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.060 
get energy from exercise we can get
energy<00:00:59.570> by<00:00:59.809> speaking<00:01:00.200> our<00:01:00.500> psychological

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
energy by speaking our psychological

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.660 
energy by speaking our psychological
needs<00:01:01.719> but<00:01:02.719> what<00:01:02.870> I<00:01:02.930> saw<00:01:03.320> was<00:01:03.350> that<00:01:03.800> we<00:01:04.100> need<00:01:04.399> to

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
needs but what I saw was that we need to

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.870 
needs but what I saw was that we need to
learn<00:01:04.819> more<00:01:04.879> about<00:01:05.569> how<00:01:06.289> to<00:01:06.319> wield<00:01:06.920> our<00:01:07.280> energy

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
learn more about how to wield our energy

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.449 
learn more about how to wield our energy
than<00:01:08.539> simply<00:01:09.049> using<00:01:09.380> traditional<00:01:09.889> techniques

00:01:10.449 --> 00:01:10.459 
than simply using traditional techniques

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:14.050 
than simply using traditional techniques
and<00:01:11.179> so<00:01:12.049> as<00:01:12.289> a<00:01:12.429> psychiatrist<00:01:13.429> and<00:01:13.759> an

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
and so as a psychiatrist and an

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.660 
and so as a psychiatrist and an
intuitive<00:01:14.450> I<00:01:15.049> want<00:01:15.679> to<00:01:15.799> be<00:01:15.950> a<00:01:15.979> bridge<00:01:16.310> between

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
intuitive I want to be a bridge between

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.239 
intuitive I want to be a bridge between
these<00:01:17.149> two<00:01:17.479> realms<00:01:17.749> and<00:01:18.200> share<00:01:18.829> with<00:01:19.069> you

00:01:19.239 --> 00:01:19.249 
these two realms and share with you

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:21.399 
these two realms and share with you
everything<00:01:19.880> I<00:01:19.999> know<00:01:20.060> about<00:01:20.569> the<00:01:21.049> world<00:01:21.200> of

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
everything I know about the world of

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.580 
everything I know about the world of
energy<00:01:21.770> because<00:01:22.009> it<00:01:22.369> is<00:01:22.429> so<00:01:22.969> intriguing<00:01:23.719> but

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
energy because it is so intriguing but

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.109 
energy because it is so intriguing but
when<00:01:24.770> I<00:01:24.799> was<00:01:25.039> going<00:01:25.279> through<00:01:25.579> Medical<00:01:26.090> School

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
when I was going through Medical School

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.019 
when I was going through Medical School
I<00:01:26.569> remember<00:01:27.020> sitting<00:01:27.229> in<00:01:27.439> classes<00:01:27.829> and<00:01:28.399> my

00:01:29.019 --> 00:01:29.029 
I remember sitting in classes and my

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:30.999 
I remember sitting in classes and my
professors<00:01:29.539> would<00:01:29.810> be<00:01:29.929> talking<00:01:30.380> about<00:01:30.439> energy

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
professors would be talking about energy

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:32.379 
professors would be talking about energy
and<00:01:31.159> it<00:01:31.219> would<00:01:31.310> seem<00:01:31.579> like<00:01:31.729> the<00:01:31.789> most<00:01:32.090> boring

00:01:32.379 --> 00:01:32.389 
and it would seem like the most boring

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:35.709 
and it would seem like the most boring
subject<00:01:33.170> to<00:01:33.409> me<00:01:33.619> when<00:01:34.310> really<00:01:34.340> it<00:01:35.179> is<00:01:35.509> the

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:35.719 
subject to me when really it is the

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:38.800 
subject to me when really it is the
essence<00:01:36.229> of<00:01:36.380> life<00:01:36.649> it's<00:01:37.579> the<00:01:37.700> essence<00:01:38.270> of<00:01:38.420> your

with<00:01:59.810> you<00:01:59.959> how<00:02:00.169> to<00:02:00.200> build<00:02:00.679> your<00:02:00.799> positive

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:01.489 
with you how to build your positive

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:03.309 
with you how to build your positive
energy<00:02:01.880> so<00:02:02.119> that<00:02:02.689> you<00:02:02.899> can<00:02:03.079> have<00:02:03.229> better

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:03.319 
energy so that you can have better

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:06.010 
energy so that you can have better
relationships<00:02:04.249> and<00:02:04.549> also<00:02:05.359> learn<00:02:05.749> how<00:02:05.779> to

relationships and also learn how to

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.950 
relationships and also learn how to
dissipate<00:02:06.919> whatever<00:02:07.819> negative<00:02:08.149> energy<00:02:08.840> you

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
dissipate whatever negative energy you

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.510 
dissipate whatever negative energy you
have<00:02:09.140> in<00:02:09.290> your<00:02:09.410> life<00:02:09.649> so<00:02:10.009> that<00:02:10.040> it<00:02:10.280> really

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
have in your life so that it really
