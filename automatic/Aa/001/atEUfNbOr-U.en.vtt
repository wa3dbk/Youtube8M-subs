I<00:01:32.340> typically<00:01:32.729> get<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.180> lot<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.479> kills<00:01:33.720> in<00:01:33.840> the

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
I typically get a lot of kills in the

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.510 
I typically get a lot of kills in the
game<00:01:34.079> I'm<00:01:34.380> usually<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.740> main<00:01:34.979> Slayer<00:01:35.220> on<00:01:35.340> the

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
game I'm usually the main Slayer on the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.840 
game I'm usually the main Slayer on the
team<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.820> I'm<00:01:35.909> playing<00:01:36.060> with

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
team that I'm playing with

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.429 
team that I'm playing with
and<00:01:36.970> the<00:01:37.360> support<00:01:37.689> upgrade<00:01:37.930> is<00:01:38.080> too<00:01:38.200> good<00:01:38.350> to

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
and the support upgrade is too good to

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:39.660 
and the support upgrade is too good to
pass<00:01:38.470> up<00:01:38.860> it<00:01:39.070> gives<00:01:39.130> me<00:01:39.340> more<00:01:39.369> of<00:01:39.580> an

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
pass up it gives me more of an

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.580 
pass up it gives me more of an
opportunity<00:01:39.880> to<00:01:40.210> drop<00:01:40.630> that<00:01:40.810> power<00:01:41.020> boost<00:01:41.350> or

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
opportunity to drop that power boost or

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.920 
opportunity to drop that power boost or
or<00:01:42.490> damage<00:01:42.820> boost<00:01:43.030> rather<00:01:43.240> in<00:01:43.450> a<00:01:43.570> sniper<00:01:43.810> rifle

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
or damage boost rather in a sniper rifle

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.840 
or damage boost rather in a sniper rifle
so<00:01:44.350> I<00:01:44.380> can't<00:01:44.680> really<00:01:44.830> I<00:01:45.130> can't<00:01:45.250> really<00:01:45.520> get

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
so I can't really I can't really get

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.490 
so I can't really I can't really get
anything<00:01:46.030> better<00:01:46.270> than<00:01:46.420> that<00:01:46.600> all<00:01:47.290> rights

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
anything better than that all rights

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.530

moving on to my layout I also use the

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.950 
moving on to my layout I also use the
DMR<00:01:50.280> unfortunately<00:01:51.280> over<00:01:51.399> the<00:01:51.520> BR<00:01:51.939> I<00:01:52.210> i<00:01:52.479> missed

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
anyway so i used the bold shot because

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.469 
anyway so i used the bold shot because
once<00:01:59.140> again<00:01:59.200> it<00:01:59.500> is<00:01:59.619> pretty<00:01:59.920> o<00:02:00.159> P<00:02:00.460> is<00:02:01.090> for<00:02:01.450> a

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
once again it is pretty o P is for a

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
vision for a different reason i use it

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.080 
vision for a different reason i use it
because<00:02:04.960> i<00:02:05.170> play<00:02:05.380> bumper<00:02:05.619> jumper<00:02:05.920> so<00:02:06.700> i<00:02:06.729> can't

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
because i play bumper jumper so i can't

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.080 
because i play bumper jumper so i can't
really<00:02:07.240> use<00:02:07.720> the<00:02:08.050> jetpack<00:02:08.890> and<00:02:09.130> fight<00:02:09.819> at<00:02:09.970> the

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
really use the jetpack and fight at the

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.670 
really use the jetpack and fight at the
same<00:02:10.300> time<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:10.750> permian<00:02:11.260> vision<00:02:11.560> you<00:02:11.650> know

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
same time the permian vision you know

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.110 
same time the permian vision you know
you<00:02:11.830> just<00:02:11.950> press<00:02:12.250> X<00:02:12.489> and<00:02:12.670> you're<00:02:12.790> done<00:02:12.940> just

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
you just press X and you're done just

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.449 
you just press X and you're done just
quick<00:02:13.840> easy<00:02:14.140> and<00:02:14.440> so<00:02:14.860> that's<00:02:14.980> why<00:02:15.130> use<00:02:15.280> that

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
quick easy and so that's why use that

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.160 
quick easy and so that's why use that
then<00:02:15.670> I<00:02:15.730> have<00:02:15.880> resupply<00:02:16.510> I<00:02:16.540> used<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:16.900> resupply

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
then I have resupply I used to resupply

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.890 
then I have resupply I used to resupply
over<00:02:17.680> grenadiers<00:02:18.220> because<00:02:18.580> I<00:02:18.900> typically

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
over grenadiers because I typically

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.290 
over grenadiers because I typically
lasts<00:02:20.620> a<00:02:20.830> little<00:02:20.950> longer<00:02:21.069> and<00:02:21.430> I<00:02:21.489> feel<00:02:22.090> like<00:02:22.120> it

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
lasts a little longer and I feel like it

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.610 
lasts a little longer and I feel like it
gives<00:02:22.390> me<00:02:22.569> the<00:02:22.600> same<00:02:22.840> advantage<00:02:23.350> of
