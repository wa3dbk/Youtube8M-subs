00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
general lore of the game I've covered

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.930 
general lore of the game I've covered
almost<00:04:51.350> everything<00:04:51.560> that<00:04:52.160> I<00:04:52.340> can<00:04:52.640> still

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
almost everything that I can still

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.850 
almost everything that I can still
missing<00:04:53.240> quite<00:04:53.390> a<00:04:53.450> few<00:04:53.690> places<00:04:53.840> and<00:04:54.140> there's

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
missing quite a few places and there's

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.590 
missing quite a few places and there's
sort<00:04:55.100> of<00:04:55.190> areas<00:04:55.550> that<00:04:55.760> I<00:04:55.790> haven't<00:04:56.150> covered<00:04:56.420> yet

sort of areas that I haven't covered yet

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.300 
sort of areas that I haven't covered yet

them most notably like Cabarrus is a
really<00:05:01.640> highly<00:05:01.850> court<00:05:02.180> requested<00:05:02.660> one<00:05:02.840> and

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
really highly court requested one and

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.510 
really highly court requested one and
there's<00:05:03.200> not<00:05:03.410> a<00:05:03.440> lot<00:05:03.650> of<00:05:03.680> information<00:05:04.190> on<00:05:04.310> him

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
there's not a lot of information on him

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.850 
there's not a lot of information on him
and<00:05:04.780> it's<00:05:05.780> not<00:05:05.960> that<00:05:06.110> I<00:05:06.140> don't<00:05:06.230> want<00:05:06.500> to<00:05:06.680> cover

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
and it's not that I don't want to cover

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:07.930 
and it's not that I don't want to cover
him<00:05:07.040> because<00:05:07.310> there's<00:05:07.460> not<00:05:07.670> a<00:05:07.730> lot<00:05:07.910> of

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
him because there's not a lot of

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.280 
him because there's not a lot of
information<00:05:08.420> it's<00:05:08.570> I<00:05:08.690> don't<00:05:08.960> want<00:05:09.110> to<00:05:09.170> make<00:05:09.230> a

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
information it's I don't want to make a

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.130 
information it's I don't want to make a
4<00:05:09.650> minute<00:05:09.770> video<00:05:10.010> and<00:05:10.520> have<00:05:11.450> that<00:05:11.660> video<00:05:11.810> be

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 
4 minute video and have that video be

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.020 
4 minute video and have that video be
lackluster<00:05:12.410> an<00:05:13.040> done<00:05:13.190> compared<00:05:13.550> well<00:05:13.730> to<00:05:13.910> the

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
lackluster an done compared well to the

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.820 
lackluster an done compared well to the
others<00:05:14.360> so<00:05:14.990> that's<00:05:15.170> sort<00:05:15.440> of<00:05:15.560> what<00:05:15.740> I'm

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
others so that's sort of what I'm

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.740 
others so that's sort of what I'm
struggling<00:05:16.250> with<00:05:16.520> right<00:05:17.090> now<00:05:17.150> I'm<00:05:17.570> still

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
struggling with right now I'm still

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.840 
struggling with right now I'm still
going<00:05:17.870> to<00:05:17.930> continue<00:05:18.230> to<00:05:18.380> do<00:05:18.500> lore<00:05:18.740> videos<00:05:19.100> but

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
going to continue to do lore videos but

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.460 
going to continue to do lore videos but
i<00:05:19.910> really<00:05:20.270> think<00:05:20.300> that<00:05:20.570> the<00:05:20.750> theories<00:05:21.170> video

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
i really think that the theories video

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.290 
i really think that the theories video
may<00:05:21.740> take<00:05:22.220> precedence<00:05:22.790> because<00:05:23.030> there's<00:05:23.210> a

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
may take precedence because there's a

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.120 
may take precedence because there's a
lot<00:05:23.570> of<00:05:23.600> room<00:05:23.900> for<00:05:23.930> expansion<00:05:24.380> in<00:05:24.740> that<00:05:24.920> area

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
lot of room for expansion in that area

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.220 
lot of room for expansion in that area
you<00:05:25.700> guys<00:05:25.850> seem<00:05:26.090> very<00:05:26.270> interested<00:05:26.600> in<00:05:26.930> it<00:05:27.050> you
