Lingenfelter C&amp;C l9t two heads just got
these<00:00:44.789> back<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.210> week

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.700 

did<00:00:55.990> some<00:00:56.140> beautiful<00:00:56.560> work<00:00:56.710> on<00:00:56.920> them<00:00:58.710> look

did some beautiful work on them look
great<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:05.470> exhaust<00:01:05.650> ports<00:01:06.040> are<00:01:06.160> known<00:01:06.370> to

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
great the exhaust ports are known to

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.460 
great the exhaust ports are known to
have<00:01:06.580> little<00:01:07.420> flow<00:01:07.720> so<00:01:07.960> that's<00:01:08.110> the<00:01:08.230> part<00:01:08.410> I

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
have little flow so that's the part I

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.710 
have little flow so that's the part I
was<00:01:08.560> really<00:01:08.800> worried<00:01:08.980> about<00:01:09.010> is<00:01:09.190> getting<00:01:09.430> that

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
was really worried about is getting that

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.469 
was really worried about is getting that
good<00:01:10.720> set<00:01:11.080> of<00:01:11.110> heads<00:01:11.380> with<00:01:11.590> a<00:01:12.030> good<00:01:13.030> flowing

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
good set of heads with a good flowing

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.520 
good set of heads with a good flowing
exhaust<00:01:13.840> port<00:01:14.200> the<00:01:14.920> intake<00:01:15.220> is<00:01:15.370> just<00:01:15.550> a<00:01:15.640> bonus

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
exhaust port the intake is just a bonus

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.440 
exhaust port the intake is just a bonus
because<00:01:17.530> they're<00:01:17.770> already<00:01:18.030> flow<00:01:19.030> really<00:01:19.300> well

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
because they're already flow really well

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.520 
because they're already flow really well
in<00:01:19.600> these<00:01:19.720> lnt<00:01:20.260> two<00:01:20.410> heads<00:01:20.650> from<00:01:21.400> the<00:01:21.520> factory

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
in these lnt two heads from the factory

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.200 
in these lnt two heads from the factory
so<00:01:24.630> but<00:01:25.630> I've<00:01:25.780> also<00:01:25.930> upgraded<00:01:26.380> them<00:01:26.470> to<00:01:26.650> I<00:01:27.210> the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
so but I've also upgraded them to I the

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.200 
so but I've also upgraded them to I the
ls3<00:01:28.920> intake<00:01:29.920> valve<00:01:30.160> versus<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:30.610> led<00:01:30.880> to<00:01:31.000> this

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
ls3 intake valve versus the led to this

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.550 
ls3 intake valve versus the led to this
is<00:01:31.360> the<00:01:31.479> l9t<00:01:32.369> 206<00:01:33.369> grams<00:01:33.869> here's<00:01:34.869> the<00:01:35.140> ls3

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
is the l9t 206 grams here's the ls3

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
is the l9t 206 grams here's the ls3
hollow<00:01:35.979> stem<00:01:36.340> which<00:01:36.580> is<00:01:36.810> 87<00:01:37.810> to<00:01:37.900> 90<00:01:38.229> grams<00:01:38.580> you

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
hollow stem which is 87 to 90 grams you

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.300 
hollow stem which is 87 to 90 grams you
can<00:01:39.729> see<00:01:39.910> the<00:01:40.060> machine<00:01:40.330> work<00:01:40.509> is<00:01:41.040> as<00:01:42.040> much

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
can see the machine work is as much

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.910 
can see the machine work is as much
finer<00:01:42.700> on<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:44.380> ls3<00:01:45.009> valve<00:01:45.490> versus<00:01:46.030> the<00:01:46.470> L<00:01:47.470> 92

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
finer on the ls3 valve versus the L 92

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.490 
finer on the ls3 valve versus the L 92
Val<00:01:48.190> so<00:01:48.940> that's<00:01:49.119> saving<00:01:49.330> like<00:01:49.660> 20-some<00:01:50.200> grams

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
Val so that's saving like 20-some grams

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.130 
Val so that's saving like 20-some grams
is<00:01:50.710> a<00:01:50.740> huge<00:01:51.040> issue<00:01:51.190> provout<00:01:51.910> drink<00:01:52.240> control<00:01:52.540> so

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
is a huge issue provout drink control so

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.660 
is a huge issue provout drink control so
I<00:01:53.440> think<00:01:53.950> this<00:01:54.130> is<00:01:54.220> going<00:01:54.310> to<00:01:54.399> be<00:01:54.460> a<00:01:54.490> pretty

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
I think this is going to be a pretty

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.150 
I think this is going to be a pretty
sweet<00:01:54.790> setup<00:01:54.910> but<00:01:55.509> let's<00:01:56.470> just<00:01:56.560> show<00:01:57.070> them

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
sweet setup but let's just show them

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.980 
sweet setup but let's just show them
somebody<00:01:57.550> back<00:01:57.759> at<00:01:57.910> home<00:01:58.060> what's<00:01:58.509> going<00:01:58.720> on<00:01:58.780> my
