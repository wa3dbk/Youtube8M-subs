00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.710
 rush 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.740
 listen it seems we died again 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.350
 Zdarovki seems like I lost my memory and 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.110
 hit the other different from my world 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.450
 and bastard give my bank however today 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.580
 we will really take a trip around 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.130
 unknown world because today I 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.789
 tell you about them amnezia in Russian 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.580
 translation 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.190
 but amnezia will not pull that 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.530
 pulled pulled q and let's start start with 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.780
 the fact that we have a woman well in 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.410
 as the head of any chance you are 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.219
 Humble on calling her but she 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.399
 no name 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.930
 let's call them heroin heroin but just 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.940
 there is no time to explain heroines 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.010
 something concrete they are not known 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.570
 the plot begins with the heroin 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.340
 awakens from sleep in the back 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.960
 restaurant and does not remember anything from her 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.640
 amnezia its further action 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.979
 standard for a person who has lost 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.240
 memory pretends that everything is good and 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.850
 as if nothing had happened 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.830
 communicates with people she does not know 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.289
 as she guesses are and and 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.360
 close friends and acquaintances ah 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:17.490
 yes forgot to tell losing memory 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.680
 takes out you get the essence gift in 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.750
 the kind of spirit that only you see as 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.360
 time he explains to our heroine that she 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.549
 lost memory and there was a lot 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.740
 he does not know and tank as I said 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.900
 appeared after the loss of a girl's memory 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.970
 but this thing must be corrected and memory 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.159
 our ocean needs to be put in place 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.960
 will be engaged but as will be mostly 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.970
 she will suck and chat with 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.159
 boys but not with all and with 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.320
 specific but so that with our heroine not 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.630
 happened at some point will come in 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.909
 quantum leap and it will move already 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.189
 in another world this will not happen 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.560
 once in every world she meets again 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.780
 supposedly friends one of which is her 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.729
 boyfriend sucking him is included in every 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.009
 the world meets the heroine of the strange 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.170
 a boy who is not illusory 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.240
 that she knows about her little skull 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.130
 the defect is basically all about how 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.079
 she communicates with guys after 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.670
 every jump there but you have to 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.600
 meet them but in new 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.329
 circumstances 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.299
 and then well then everything is the same 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:18.060
 new world new old acquaintances intrigue 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:19.980
 for the sauce and Iâ€™ll say they are right 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.260
 look just for the final 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.550
 the series is basically an everyday trick with 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.830
 a touch of mystics and yes they are all 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.780

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.860

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.640

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.100
