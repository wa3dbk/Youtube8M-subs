 reports from the Pima County coroner's office show that since the 

00:00:05.959 --> 00:00:10.600
 year 2000 two thousand seven hundred people have died in the desert 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:16.390
 statistics that year after year continue to increase and in 2010 it has not been the 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.650
 exception since last month they retrieved 59 corpses of men and 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.039
 women the ocu both instances 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.609
 first to fully identify 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.220
 that person who dies in his attempt 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.259
 and that 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:32.460

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.790
 immediately the selection informs the family 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.670
 the coroner works overtime to give 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.530
 with identity these bodies 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.479
 In most cases 

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:49.039
 they do not have identification they are squeezing that tasks are streamlined 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:53.170
 of the coroner we have almost 300 people affected in 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.949

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:56.640
 we think they are 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.230
 other countries 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.600
 in July 2005, 69 bodies were found 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.530
 number that alarmed the authorities since it had never been seen and this month of 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.000
 July the tragedies added to 59 the majority of immigrant bodies 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.180
 recovered were found in desert areas like this one 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.320
 in just July 15, five men and two women were found 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.770
 if that we have received during these last days 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.230
 around 20 notifications 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.660
 Like every year, the coroner's office is prepared to receive 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:31.829
 the deceased 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.659
 but now he has had to find a place to store the corpses and to 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.140
 that have brought this trailer that serves as a refrigerator to avoid 

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:43.280
 decomposition 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.100

 these immigrants the saddest thing is that family members wait impatiently for 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:04.820
 know the whereabouts of their loved ones 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.229
 and even sadder without knowing that they could be refrigerated or maybe 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.299
