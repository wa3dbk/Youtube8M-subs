00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:18.419
 skin game of the year in my opinion and before 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.070
 I do not want to say that I acquired 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:21.210
 liked and I liked a lot not in vain 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.070
 we have put in an outstanding 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.230
 hobbynews on the radio on video that 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.750
 you can see but I think that although it is a 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.189
 great game and that offers many 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.619
 things that are awesome 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.690
 recognize it but for me it is not a game 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.980
 that meets what has to be a 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.050
 game of the no game year has to 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.940
 me is something else different then 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.430
 ordinaire what but I tell you that for 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.560
 me more than the game of the year of what 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.780
 we understand the boat and famous is the 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.300
 I play the year because you need a minimum 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.800
 year to see it whole but it's already 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.630
 from there I think there are others 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.579
 much better candidates 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.260
 Well, unlike my partner 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.300
 jose I do believe that is that you have the 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.370
 game of the year because with the crisis that 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.130
 there is and the one that is falling tell me a 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.829
 game that the payments allow you to be 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.439
 playing hours hours hours and hours without 

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:08.369
 stop doing things so different 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.510
 simply for that reason but it's a 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.280
 game the year 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.960
 for me this is not a game of the year 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.430
 because I think it has come out with many 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.860
 mistakes is a game that takes a lot 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.260
 time in development after all 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.940
 we are talking about a game that 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.100
 we hope for the best and obviously 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.930
 they can always be produced and always 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.640
 can fix more via patch but 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.530
 I think a game of the year can not have 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.300
 the errors that it has had is that in 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.310
 as to departures that despite being a 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.860
 game of outstanding has according to the 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.450
 console version ps3 or 360 some 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.510
 mistakes that seem to me 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.790
 remove that finish that should have a 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.740
 game that you say is perfect in this 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.660
 perfect perfect oil I do not know remember 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.550
 well to boat soon and the second when 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.500
 it comes out at the time it was not surprising 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.640
 it's well done and well finished and you could 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.280
 a big game 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.229
 that skyrim has errors ebooks is 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.360
 true that technically is not perfect 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.570
 It is also true but I think that in a 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.460
 so tan game so immense and with 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.200
 so many possibilities I think are failures 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.510
 perfectly excusable and not 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.979
 they affect too much when it comes to playing 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.229
 Also also keep in mind that 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.330
 comes folded and in a game this 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.640
 magnitude is an added value very have 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.190
 in mind in my opinion I'm 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.470
 amateur role-playing and betesda 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.780
 with fallout 3 or false or vegas that is 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.250
 which he devotes more time both the 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.480
 I was really tied at last and 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.420
 at the end they are games that have come out 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.580
 last three years have come skyrim and 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.220
 the ones that I said and when I tried 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.110
 skating I loved the open world I 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.180
 it seems incredible especially as it was 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.130
 made unlike the fallout wilderness 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.420
 3 that was a little uglier we could 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.360
 tell him I think it was not what 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.980
 I needed the story 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.770
 I thought I was playing the same thing 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.510
 although it was another wrapper they were one thing 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.670
 fantastic medieval with dragons and 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.730
 It is indeed a complete wonder 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.900
 to go around but that emotion that has 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.550
 I felt the desire to play it 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.290
 they removed the moment in which I saw that by 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.420
 under the scam the three were 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.920
 obviously the code of the plane was 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.930
 for the nine gas and here came to play 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.940
 many many many many hours with those 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.540
 games that local was like going back to 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.379
 start a game to those games 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.390
 actually away because skyrim 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:16.090
 original what is original I do not expect 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.549
 that no other game candidate of the year 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.819
 what is the last of orphan is 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:24.090
 select uncharted 3 is not original 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:26.530
 portal 2 is not original the new zelda 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.829
 is not original then good that 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.569
 reason and different to me surfing I go back to 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.400
 repeat that for me it is karim is a game 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.290
 of outstanding best played of the year 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.670
 but not the game of the year, not that because 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.930
 if you are used many times to 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.510
 that a game the year has to be the one that 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.000
 more offer and in some section about 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.900
 everything in the case of this link in hours 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.459
 obvious ambience also has it 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.319
 but especially now they do not have many 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.510
 many hours it seems that another game that 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.799
 we want to compare is no longer valid for game 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.780
 of the year because he does not have many hours 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.950
 how do I fall as modern warfare 3 I can 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.150
 worth perfectly because I have a 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.220
 short campaign because I want 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.510
 multiplayer that justifies the network of 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.650
 retention had many hours and already 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.799
 it seemed like it has to be the game of 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.799
 year 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.430
 the reasons but not only for the 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.170
 amount of which I have a hobby is 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.450
 for me a game of the year has to be 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.460
 a game that is competent round 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.710
 without original failures that contribute things 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.690
 new mostly not originality that yes 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.130
 push me to the new and in that I believe 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.350
 that writing does not do any of them and 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.060
 also went on the market with failures and for 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.430
 that for me I think it can not be the 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.650
 game of the year look at joseph this is so 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:29.310
 simple as that in the rest of the 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:32.100
 Match candidates of the year are games 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.320
 that are governed by an iron 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.810
 established and instead on the sky in the 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.310
 script of the three had to hold a 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.520
 open world you go where you want 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.440
 do what you want is good you're bad 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.540
 can be a vampire can be a cannibal in 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.670
 end this game the adventure you write it 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.830
 you and in another for the adventure you the 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:52.110
 write in others and you play them in addition 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.570
 iTunes third young or not as not 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.000
 he appreciates in his game mistake dan and what 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:00.920
 I feel but the polite does not remove the rodero 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.920
 and it 's our best cadran
