have to like my eyebrows are kind of
sparse<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.560> curly<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:32.970> this<00:01:33.659> just<00:01:33.930> helps<00:01:34.380> it

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680

something I might just keep up and for

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.140 
something I might just keep up and for
like<00:02:08.340> ten<00:02:08.759> dollars<00:02:09.209> look<00:02:10.069> living<00:02:11.069> in<00:02:11.340> New<00:02:11.910> York
