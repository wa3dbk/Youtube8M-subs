00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:06.430
 hello what if you ever 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:08.259
 they had asked how is it that a rocket 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.880
 can enter orbit a planet or 

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:12.730
 how do you do it so that anything 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.650
 enter orbit of a planet are of 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.350
 lucky because I will explain them to you with 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.910
 My friend helps battle that hern치n 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.449
 that is right down here and has 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.150
 prepared in your space capsule and ready 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.970
 for 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.279
 an orbital flight 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.160
 as you know the planets are 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.350
 round and also have a strength of 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.340
 gravity that makes when you have 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.870
 something up again fall into this 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.430
 case for example if we have something like that 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.710
 upwards it falls down again if we throw it 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.600
 completely vertical will fall on the 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.539
 same place where it came from 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.780
 if we give it a certain horizontal speed 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:54.519
 is going to move forward a little bit not talk about falling and if 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.079
 we give it more speed it goes a little 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.269
 more and fall back a little further 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:02.050
 with more speed it falls again more 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:05.830
 far away and we can give it such speed 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:09.399
 that when it falls at the same time 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.740
 is going to go around the planet and 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:15.549
 will never again touch the surface 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.729
 and this is what we call an orbit 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:21.690
 when at that moment our object or 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:24.210
 rocket is going to be in orbit 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.490
 here is our friend was coming 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.580
 prepared let's accommodate our 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:34.370
 rocket on this beautiful planet morning 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.370
 carval and we're going to 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.040
 we went out 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.170
 we take off at this moment from our 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.020
 story only has speed 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.090
 vertical so if we leave it like this it's going to 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.030
 get quite high but will go back to 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.040
 go back to where he was so we have 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.290
 have to give what is known as a turn of 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:01.080
 gravity so that it will take speed 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.840
 horizontal let's turn it over or 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.970
 less 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:10.899
 well and let's give it a little 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.899
 in this way 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.260
 to be able to release our drivers 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:31.760
 we separated impellers and now we continue 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:34.010
 with our solid fuel phases 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.450
 the phases serve so that as 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.220
 go finishing the fuel you can go 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.370
 now so removing the dead weight not 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.670
 pulling the deadlift so that with that 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.319
 fuel that you have left you can this 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.730
 move faster we are going to cut the 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.040
 authors right now that is over me 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.260
 fuel in the first stage and we're going 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.159
 to see here as our our orbit 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.890
 our trajectory is a parabola 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:03.500
 is doing a parable and what of 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.680
 This is what is going to expand irla 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.659
 making this parable wider I think 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:14.560
 which is the best as stable and we are going to 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:14.560
 come back here we let go this and 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.440
 we started the second stage 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.500
 maybe we have enough to get to 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.410
 the height of 70,000 meters that is where 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.650
 the atmosphere of kerbal치 is over 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:32.540
 from there we can start thinking about 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.659
 our entrance to the orbit 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.960
 70 123 there we cut our 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:39.540
 readers 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.730
 and what we are going to do now is that 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.820
 reach the highest point of our 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.730
 trajectory of our parable we are going to 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:50.700
 add horizontal speed until 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.680
 our parable becomes an orbit 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.330
 complete until you have such speed that 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.750
 at the same time that we are falling 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:02.300
 let's go around the planet and 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.300
 let's complete the orbit 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:08.340
 when we reach the horizon 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.340
 our 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:14.040
 our our indicator this yellow 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.889
 it's going to be over the horizon so 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.010
 we also want to be looking towards that 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:24.100
 side 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.100
 to be able to move towards 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.650
 towards the direction in which we are 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:33.750
 moving to be able to accelerate and add the 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:36.169
 horizontal speed speed in that 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.169
 address 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.250
 because that little music means that 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.440
 we know about the atmosphere when our 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.800
 our indicator is on the 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:53.680
 horizon let's put the 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.680
 speed to our body 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.380
 let's eat it here 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.670
 while we admire the beauty of 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.990
 universe 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:13.040
 from our window 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:16.510
 we are almost there 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.510
 almost almost almost 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.250
 to this 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.379
 we boost our rocket and 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.530
 we are accelerating now horizontally 

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:31.650
 and our we will see here as our 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.689
 parabola is opening and the 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.340
 moment at the same time that 

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:40.360
 let's fall we'll turn the 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:44.099
 planet and we will complete the orbit 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.099
 we are almost there 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:47.620
 little bit more there is 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.720
 it's perfect that 74 thousand and 96 thousand yes 

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:56.629
 we want to make it a little bit rounder 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:59.389
 when we arrived here at the peri halper 

00:05:56.629 --> 00:06:03.139
 star is not perigee per and so here is it 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:05.599
 precise perigee would be if this planet were 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:06.819
 it will call earth but it is not called earth 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:09.590
 it's called kerbal치 

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:11.539
 we could here the pri opsis simply 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.520
 we turn around we lower the speed and 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:16.039
 our support if it's going to go down too 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.620
 making the orbit a little more round 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:20.389
 the other way around if we want to do it more 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.909
 round but bigger we wait for us 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:27.160
 get here to stern sis and we add him 

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:30.960
 speed and will go up the pri opsis 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.960
 and as you can see, we are already on the straight 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:38.150
 we are already falling at the same time 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:41.330
 we advance 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:45.020
 over the planet and never again are we going to 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:48.670
 touch the surface of the planet that 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:51.880
 raise if we continue as we are 

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:54.220
 Our our speed is 2,300 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.380
 meters per second 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.380
 kerbal치 is much smaller than the 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:00.880
 Earth is like lives times smaller 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:03.850
 so if this were the earth our 

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:06.610
 speed would have to be 11 thousand 200 

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:09.670
 kilometers meters per second sorry 11 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:11.350
 thousand 200 meters per second that is 

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:13.420
 very much more so we would need a 

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:16.240
 much bigger rocket they are going to 

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:19.230
 dig the earth and we can achieve this 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:22.350
 in a much simpler way 

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:24.360
 and in guayas but who have understood 

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:26.220
 the explanation of how is that a rocket 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:29.310
 or any other object enters orbit 

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:32.070
 of a planet while we admire the 

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:35.820
 beauty of the caribbean planet where we can 

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:40.090
 see its surface without borders without 

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:45.430
 distinction of races or creeds 

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:50.400
 richer and poorer left us in this 

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:50.400
 video and see you until the next
