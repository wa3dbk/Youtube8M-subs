problems or issues finding my size

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:31.630 
problems or issues finding my size
because<00:00:30.529> I<00:00:30.739> feel<00:00:30.950> that<00:00:30.980> when<00:00:31.189> we<00:00:31.279> go<00:00:31.430> to<00:00:31.489> the

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
because I feel that when we go to the

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.670 
because I feel that when we go to the
regular<00:00:31.820> stores<00:00:32.360> the<00:00:32.719> size<00:00:32.930> tents<00:00:33.380> are<00:00:33.530> the

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
regular stores the size tents are the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.650

first ones to come off the shelves

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.750 
first ones to come off the shelves
because<00:00:35.899> I<00:00:36.170> think<00:00:36.770> maybe<00:00:37.010> they<00:00:37.370> don't<00:00:37.550> produce

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760
