00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello friends with you who has become 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.020
 gasoline and if you're a kid sitting by that 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.120
 side of the monitor bought recently light 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.280
 tank and do not know how to play it 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.530
 this video is just for you and for that 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.500
 to understand how to play correctly 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.740
 light tanks we delve into history 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.840
 whether light tanks with wikipedia is one of 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.029
 types of tank classification in general 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.609
 understand light tank torments himself tanks 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.010
 less mass than average but more than 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.840
 wedge heels and small tanks with it 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.000
 mass of tanks attributable to light 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.910
 different me and period varied 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.360
 extremely wide range from three s 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.610
 half tons to 4 tons 1 light tank 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.010
 ft-17 appeared on the closing period 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.680
 World War I further light 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.690
 tanks actively developed in the twenties 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.090
 years of reaching its dawn in 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.100
 thirties and being popular 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.260
 in many countries and with comparative 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.719
 low prices both in production and in 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.879
 operating but unfortunately at the end 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.930
 twentieth century light tanks lost 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.949
 its former value came to discharge 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.530
 narrow-profile machines from this 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.720
 historical background can be concluded 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.210
 what light tanks did because 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.700
 cheapness of costs later became theirs 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.680
 apply as intended for intelligence and 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.530
 for bypassing the enemy has cooled now 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.500
 pay particular attention to tactics 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.509
 use of light tank battle beginning of battle 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.270
 all of course begins with the light 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.520
 advice is the detection of enemy equipment 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.200
 he is needed for your allies 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.840
 able to properly navigate and 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.939
 distribute power evenly shine 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.610
 always need to be careful not to 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.950
 try to show on the map and all enemies 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.619
 your main task is to live as you can 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.479
 longer eye team you are her companion 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.939
 light tank tactics often 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.530
 always a highlight as much as possible 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.140
 the number of enemies while staying 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.600
 unscathed many light tank drivers 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.460
 think that at the very beginning of the battle is necessary 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.100
 by all means show the enemy 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.229
 artillery but it is not so now we analyze 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.759
 why if you even find art 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.040
 the enemy rely on what your 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.680
 allies destroy and and equals zero 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.020
 wait for your artillery to charge 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.330
 After all, they often recharge at least 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.670
 15-20 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.340
 siku if you die at the beginning 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.890
 the battlefield you fail your team leaving 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.080
 his without eyes and besides risk going into 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.050
 deep minus credit now i'm 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.070
 tell you about the armament of light tanks 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.580
 if to compare 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:31.760
 a tool with the world of insects then it is about 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.250
 as a bee's complaint you can bite someone 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.010
 but destroying the goal is hard 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.200
 often guns on light tanks are weak 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.750
 but for breaking through weakly armored 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.270
 techniques such as art sau or 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.910
 successful targeting of vulnerable areas 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:50.060
 quite enough so let's imagine 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:53.510
 we have successfully lit up such a situation 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.130
 enemy art sau and ally 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.470
 artillery or some such 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.900
 firefly how we cleaned and what to do 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.260
 further and then you need to continue to shine 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.630
 and help allies to destroy equipment 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.000
 opponent using your speed 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.720
 entering the stern abandoned tanks 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.240
 adversary 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.060
 Well, at the end of such a battle, there are only 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.970
 finish off can also be 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.370
 quite good tactics passive light from 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.550
 bushes at the beginning of the battle but to start it 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.739
 need if you are one hundred percent sure 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.110
 its success and you will not shine and at the same time 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.060
 do not kill the beginning of the battle now let you down 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.430
 the results of the foregoing the first thing 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.950
 be sure to do it shine but 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.959
 don't do it at all costs 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.600
 this rash in the center it needs to be done 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.150
 neatly and often going to sev after 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.600
 the light of three and four cars the second that 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.610
 need to do it whenever possible 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.070
 destroy the enemy's art sau as 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.410
 it is for you to do this the easiest way 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.269
 more in the presence of a mine in the third need 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.670
 support I mean helping allies 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.769
 if possible, you can 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.290
 break in and throw the enemy in the stern 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.870
 Barto and if there is no possibility that the 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.569
 you need her 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.030
 let me try to make this guide 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:09.430
 quite informative if you want more 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.890
 such videos then be sure to put likes 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.400
 and with you was stockton in gasoline all 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.400
 good luck in fights
