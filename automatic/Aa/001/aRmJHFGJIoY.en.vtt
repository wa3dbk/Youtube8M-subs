I<00:01:13.800> recommend<00:01:14.370> sort<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:14.790> flying<00:01:15.030> low<00:01:15.360> and

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
I recommend sort of flying low and

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.859 
I recommend sort of flying low and
skirting<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.950> ground<00:01:17.250> like<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.670> am<00:01:17.880> reason

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
skirting the ground like I am reason

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.990 
skirting the ground like I am reason
being<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.380> if<00:01:19.469> you<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:20.009> fly<00:01:20.250> high<00:01:20.549> you're

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
being is that if you you fly high you're

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.370 
being is that if you you fly high you're
gonna<00:01:21.119> make<00:01:21.299> yourself<00:01:21.630> an<00:01:21.719> easy<00:01:21.840> target<00:01:22.350> for

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
gonna make yourself an easy target for

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.469 
gonna make yourself an easy target for
the<00:01:22.530> missile<00:01:22.860> pods<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.399> the<00:01:23.820> battle<00:01:24.060> pods<00:01:24.270> in

the missile pods and the battle pods in
the<00:01:24.570> area<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:25.079> target<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.530> sooner<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.130> start

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
the area to target you sooner and start

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.080 
the area to target you sooner and start
firing<00:01:26.700> at<00:01:26.969> you<00:01:27.560> use<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.770> natural<00:01:29.189> cover<00:01:29.850> of

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
firing at you use the natural cover of

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.920 
firing at you use the natural cover of
the<00:01:30.210> canyons<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:31.939> dodge<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.180> missiles<00:01:33.600> you

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
the canyons to dodge the missiles you

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.510 
the canyons to dodge the missiles you
can<00:01:34.079> see<00:01:34.320> how<00:01:34.469> I<00:01:34.500> was<00:01:34.710> weaving<00:01:34.979> as<00:01:35.250> soon<00:01:35.369> as<00:01:35.460> I

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
can see how I was weaving as soon as I

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.539 
can see how I was weaving as soon as I
got<00:01:35.640> locked<00:01:35.909> on<00:01:36.119> you've<00:01:36.750> got<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.020> little

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
got locked on you've got the little

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.980 
got locked on you've got the little
stone<00:01:38.549> mesas<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.240> stick<00:01:39.420> up<00:01:39.539> other<00:01:39.689> ground

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
stone mesas that stick up other ground

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.139 
stone mesas that stick up other ground
as<00:01:40.289> soon<00:01:40.500> as<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.710> get<00:01:40.829> by<00:01:41.039> one<00:01:41.340> move<00:01:41.789> in<00:01:41.969> behind

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
as soon as you get by one move in behind

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.080 
as soon as you get by one move in behind
it<00:01:42.509> that'll<00:01:43.200> cause<00:01:44.039> the<00:01:44.070> missiles<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.640> explode

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
it that'll cause the missiles to explode

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.569 
it that'll cause the missiles to explode
and<00:01:45.359> you<00:01:45.479> can<00:01:45.630> weave<00:01:45.869> if<00:01:46.560> you've<00:01:46.740> got<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.950> target

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
and you can weave if you've got a target

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.340 
and you can weave if you've got a target
lined<00:01:47.939> up<00:01:48.090> like<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.390> by<00:01:48.600> all<00:01:48.750> means<00:01:48.780> take<00:01:49.229> it

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
lined up like that by all means take it

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.399 
lined up like that by all means take it
out<00:01:49.530> but<00:01:49.920> don't<00:01:50.359> turn<00:01:51.359> around<00:01:51.509> don't<00:01:52.140> fight

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
out but don't turn around don't fight

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:59.179 
out but don't turn around don't fight
them<00:01:54.469> you<00:01:55.469> haven't<00:01:55.710> got<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.070> time<00:01:58.189> pretty

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
them you haven't got the time pretty

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.029 
them you haven't got the time pretty
much<00:01:59.340> follow<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.969> blue<00:02:00.119> arrow<00:02:00.359> there<00:02:01.039> it's

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
much follow the blue arrow there it's

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:05.270 
much follow the blue arrow there it's
kind<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.340> hard<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.579> get<00:02:02.729> lost<00:02:03.469> and<00:02:04.469> that's

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
kind of hard to get lost and that's

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.219 
kind of hard to get lost and that's
really<00:02:05.460> all<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.670> can<00:02:05.789> say<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.840> takes<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.109> little

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
really all I can say it takes a little

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.810 
really all I can say it takes a little
bit<00:02:07.439> of<00:02:07.560> luck<00:02:07.740> if<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.130> had<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.280> lot<00:02:08.490> of<00:02:08.520> health

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
bit of luck if you had a lot of health

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.060 
bit of luck if you had a lot of health
left<00:02:09.420> over<00:02:09.780> from<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.259> first<00:02:10.500> part<00:02:10.740> of<00:02:10.890> the

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
left over from the first part of the

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.950 
left over from the first part of the
mission<00:02:11.370> when<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:12.150> were<00:02:12.300> battling<00:02:12.600> all<00:02:12.900> the

mission when you were battling all the
pods<00:02:13.200> that<00:02:13.500> definitely<00:02:14.250> helps<00:02:14.580> out<00:02:14.760> but<00:02:16.910> isn't

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
pods that definitely helps out but isn't

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.490 
pods that definitely helps out but isn't
totally<00:02:18.330> necessary<00:02:18.360> that<00:02:19.050> you<00:02:19.170> have<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.320> whole

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
totally necessary that you have a whole
