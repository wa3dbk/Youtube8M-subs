what you want to do is you know you're

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.020 
what you want to do is you know you're
more<00:04:39.419> basically<00:04:39.840> searing<00:04:40.349> the<00:04:40.530> glaze<00:04:41.190> because

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
more basically searing the glaze because

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.339 
more basically searing the glaze because
it's<00:04:42.180> so<00:04:42.270> close<00:04:42.419> to<00:04:42.630> the<00:04:42.690> heat<00:04:42.810> source<00:04:42.990> so<00:04:43.260> we

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:43.349 
it's so close to the heat source so we

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:45.050 
it's so close to the heat source so we
go<00:04:43.500> back<00:04:43.530> I'm<00:04:44.130> going<00:04:44.280> to<00:04:44.400> actually<00:04:44.729> this

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
go back I'm going to actually this

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.969 
go back I'm going to actually this
really<00:04:45.240> committed<00:04:45.570> half<00:04:45.720> flip<00:04:46.169> you<00:04:46.800> didn't

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
really committed half flip you didn't

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:51.770 
really committed half flip you didn't
happen<00:04:47.370> they'll<00:04:47.520> be<00:04:47.610> done<00:04:50.330> welcome<00:04:51.330> back<00:04:51.479> so

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
happen they'll be done welcome back so

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.050 
happen they'll be done welcome back so
what<00:04:52.380> we<00:04:52.530> did<00:04:52.770> here<00:04:53.010> is<00:04:53.190> used<00:04:53.490> to<00:04:53.639> boiler

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
what we did here is used to boiler

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.239 
what we did here is used to boiler
function<00:04:54.539> and

00:04:55.239 --> 00:04:55.249 
function and

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:57.789 
function and
we<00:04:55.759> sort<00:04:56.089> of<00:04:56.149> sear<00:04:56.509> the<00:04:56.779> top<00:04:57.139> of<00:04:57.289> meats<00:04:57.469> on<00:04:57.619> both

00:04:57.789 --> 00:04:57.799 
we sort of sear the top of meats on both

00:04:57.799 --> 00:05:00.459 
we sort of sear the top of meats on both
sides<00:04:58.069> I'm<00:04:58.819> gonna<00:04:58.999> cut<00:04:59.239> in<00:04:59.329> half<00:04:59.509> because<00:04:59.929> this

00:05:00.459 --> 00:05:00.469 
sides I'm gonna cut in half because this

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:02.859 
sides I'm gonna cut in half because this
is<00:05:00.649> my<00:05:00.799> servant<00:05:01.039> for<00:05:01.519> dinner<00:05:01.669> so<00:05:02.599> what<00:05:02.719> I<00:05:02.749> have

00:05:02.859 --> 00:05:02.869 
is my servant for dinner so what I have

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:06.609 
is my servant for dinner so what I have
here<00:05:02.899> is<00:05:03.139> um<00:05:03.729> some<00:05:04.729> rice<00:05:04.939> broccoli<00:05:05.629> some<00:05:06.439> mean

00:05:06.609 --> 00:05:06.619 
here is um some rice broccoli some mean

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:09.089 
here is um some rice broccoli some mean
okay<00:05:06.919> so<00:05:07.549> this<00:05:07.639> is<00:05:07.849> this<00:05:07.969> is<00:05:08.119> very<00:05:08.149> simple<00:05:08.629> um

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:09.099 
okay so this is this is very simple um

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:12.549 
okay so this is this is very simple um
you<00:05:10.099> seen<00:05:10.429> earlier<00:05:10.819> you<00:05:11.149> can<00:05:11.299> just<00:05:11.509> this<00:05:12.199> gives

00:05:12.549 --> 00:05:12.559 
you seen earlier you can just this gives

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:14.259 
you seen earlier you can just this gives
a<00:05:12.619> little<00:05:12.829> more<00:05:12.919> complexity<00:05:13.639> because<00:05:14.029> in<00:05:14.149> the

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:14.269 
a little more complexity because in the

00:05:14.269 --> 00:05:16.689 
a little more complexity because in the
last<00:05:14.389> recipe<00:05:14.749> so<00:05:15.019> it's<00:05:15.199> just<00:05:15.319> me<00:05:15.439> so<00:05:15.739> but<00:05:16.459> what

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:16.699 
last recipe so it's just me so but what

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:19.179 
last recipe so it's just me so but what
we<00:05:17.059> have<00:05:17.239> here<00:05:17.449> is<00:05:17.479> it's<00:05:17.929> just<00:05:17.989> a<00:05:18.199> go<00:05:18.349> very

00:05:19.179 --> 00:05:19.189 
we have here is it's just a go very

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:21.129 
we have here is it's just a go very
close<00:05:19.459> to<00:05:19.729> the<00:05:19.819> premise<00:05:20.149> of<00:05:20.269> stick<00:05:20.539> but<00:05:20.809> flip

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:21.139 
close to the premise of stick but flip

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:23.259 
close to the premise of stick but flip
it<00:05:21.259> around<00:05:21.349> so<00:05:22.159> what<00:05:22.309> we<00:05:22.369> do<00:05:22.549> is<00:05:22.579> we<00:05:22.849> cook<00:05:23.089> the

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:23.269 
it around so what we do is we cook the

00:05:23.269 --> 00:05:24.759 
it around so what we do is we cook the
salmon<00:05:23.479> into<00:05:23.809> it's<00:05:24.109> sort<00:05:24.409> of<00:05:24.469> cooked<00:05:24.619> inside

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:24.769 
salmon into it's sort of cooked inside

00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:27.669 
salmon into it's sort of cooked inside
and<00:05:25.159> then<00:05:25.279> we<00:05:25.399> sear<00:05:25.669> it<00:05:26.499> remember<00:05:27.499> when<00:05:27.649> we

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:27.679 
and then we sear it remember when we

00:05:27.679 --> 00:05:29.859 
and then we sear it remember when we
cook<00:05:27.949> steak<00:05:28.249> we<00:05:28.579> want<00:05:28.729> to<00:05:28.819> sear<00:05:29.209> the<00:05:29.360> steak<00:05:29.599> and

00:05:29.859 --> 00:05:29.869 
cook steak we want to sear the steak and

00:05:29.869 --> 00:05:32.499 
cook steak we want to sear the steak and
then<00:05:30.529> we<00:05:30.649> want<00:05:30.769> to<00:05:30.860> cook<00:05:30.979> inside<00:05:31.369> so<00:05:32.179> I<00:05:32.209> hope

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:32.509 
then we want to cook inside so I hope

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:36.459 
then we want to cook inside so I hope
you<00:05:32.659> enjoyed<00:05:32.899> this<00:05:33.049> and<00:05:33.439> one<00:05:34.129> ever<00:05:34.279> takes
