00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.500
 I do not even know what I would like myself 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.689

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.770
 organize hen party master class 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.250
 first we define what 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.010
 we are going to do it and what 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.980
 more interesting occupation than unusual occupation 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.270

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:53.780
 it will be more interesting to all its participants 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.579
 so it could be something that 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.649
 in ordinary life just do not try but on 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.649
 hen party you can easily do it and 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.479
 the bride does not have to own this theme 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.210
 or you can just find it on the internet 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.119

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.520
 efforts to do what you want 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.670
 then we came up with what we want 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.060
 subject then we buy materials and 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.520
 if it is not necessary to conduct all the houses there 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.220
 spends so much but because the material 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.020
 as a rule material for creativity and 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.400
 other materials are not cheap and you 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.060
 see for yourself 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:40.970

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:44.729
 budget options and 3 to 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:47.250

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.860
 try something namely go some 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.110
 goals so let's now look at 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.350

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.960
