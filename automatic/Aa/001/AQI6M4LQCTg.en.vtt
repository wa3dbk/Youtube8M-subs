just<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.040> basic<00:01:08.340> standard<00:01:09.030> packaging<00:01:09.450> box

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
just a basic standard packaging box

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.750 
just a basic standard packaging box
looks<00:01:10.140> quite<00:01:10.380> nice<00:01:11.420> sides<00:01:12.420> show<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.549> USB<00:01:14.549> oh

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
looks quite nice sides show you USB oh

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.850 
looks quite nice sides show you USB oh
and<00:01:15.180> by<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.330> way<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.810> USB<00:01:17.240> cord<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.860> braided
