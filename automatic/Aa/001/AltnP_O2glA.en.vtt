00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:17.930
 and then with the charger also 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:23.360
 there we see that it has 1.4 the second line 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:25.310
 has 1.0 point 2 try to climb in the 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.930
 third always to see almost the same one 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.930
 2.9 2.8 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.040
 then he does not want to turn on this 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:40.989
 moment we are taking a reading of 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.140
 voltages the voltages that come from 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:46.030
 Here proof of life with him 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.280
 the usb cable that in the computer 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.890
 we are testing here that is coming 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.230
 the voltage here the voltage is going in 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.350
 to list power power propeller is a 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.720
 setting it out for the betis and there 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.479
 we see that very little voltage coming out 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.399
 1.2 voltage this is really 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:06.190
 too low for the system 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.750
 can start and is not coming 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.640
 the voltage that should reach the line 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.009
 policy most likely is that people 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.110
 He said that he let it get wet and helix 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.840
 power is not responding let's go here 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.060
 it reaches to move as with moisture as 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.890
 sulfate let's apply the liquid 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.979
 service we are going to let him act under 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.470
 helix power let's let it penetrate 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.000
 down there then let's make a neighborhood 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.090
 with distilled water demineralized water 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.789
 we are going to remove all that chemical and there 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.890
 yes we would proceed to solve and look 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:37.890
 how would this phone answer 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.490
 after we apply on the inside of the lis 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:59.159
 we let him act 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.900
 for about five or ten minutes and then 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.900
 then we would do the cleaning 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.220
 and now then we see the phone 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.620
 lighting normally after you 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.260
 we did the cleaning with the liquid 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.940
 service him since the client had 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.879
 indicated that the telephone had been 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:22.110
 wet we proceed to uncover the bandage 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:24.880
 and check the circuits and we found 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.550
 remains of sulfate moisture here by the 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.380
 side of I did and the behavior was 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.630
 it was normal of what we had 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.720
 taught in the course then here we see 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.209
 that there will already be the debate line of 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.340
 debate efe the line of positive the 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.890
 battery that comes propeller power now yes 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.769
 is having the test done with 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.930
 usb cable we are here looking at the 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:50.829
 normal behavior that is 0.9 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:53.530
 up to 1.4 volts this line d tx 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:55.690
 rx rx battery as it has a 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.860
 normal behavior and here we see the 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.690
 line goes from battery invade you and the 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.230
 we see that it has its behavior hours 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.420
 and normal 2.85 and the negative line then 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.790
 normal that shows no voltage 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.860
 now let's analyze him 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.829
 power if it is working normal without 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:19.000
 no short because the line itself 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:21.110
 its voltage is coming out as is the 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.270
 required 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.450
 we already see all the normal voltages 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:30.560
 this the voltage that on the usb cable and 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.900
 here we see the 1.8 digital voltage that 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.390
 it's a special voltage here in this case 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.340
 is marking almost 2 volts is a 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.470
 approximate voltage 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.069
 and now the phone if we could 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.379
 turn on 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:46.200
 and after having applied it to the 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:48.629
 liquid service then we 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.909
 we do with this atomizer with water 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:53.939
 demineralized after we apply the 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:56.909
 chemical we make use of the power of 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:59.579
 You are having this ejecting water jet 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:01.769
 we put it below the ipc power and 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:03.599
 we force out any summary to 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.540
 after being soaked with the chemical 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:09.419
 and we have had some good results in 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:14.749
 this case we will see that the phone 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:14.749
 now it is turning on normally 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.950
 Today we see that already 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.370
 I showed the power bulb of 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.169
 switched on 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.780
 and now let's see what will illuminate 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:29.479
 the keyboard meaning that the 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:34.639
 phone is already turning on normally 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:37.070
 there we see there we are analyzing and we are going 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.290
 to wait for it to end up there 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.389
 we see already ignited the leds wanting 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.460
 say that the phone we could 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:45.560
 solve if you have any failure of 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.630
 these can be helix power that this is 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.210
 a fatal one and the phone can not 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:54.699
 answer service the arauca service 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.699
 professional technician mobile phone
