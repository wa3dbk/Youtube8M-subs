kill<00:01:41.880> um<00:01:43.100> you<00:01:44.100> know<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.220> rather<00:01:44.460> had<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.729> be

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
kill um you know I rather had to be

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.280 
kill um you know I rather had to be
behind<00:01:44.909> him<00:01:45.240> or<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.420> had<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.780> have<00:01:45.899> him<00:01:45.990> stunned

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
behind him or I had to have him stunned

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.980 
behind him or I had to have him stunned
and<00:01:47.149> sometimes<00:01:48.149> it's<00:01:48.360> hard<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.600> get<00:01:48.720> behind

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
and sometimes it's hard to get behind

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.109 
and sometimes it's hard to get behind
people<00:01:49.320> especially<00:01:49.950> if<00:01:50.189> you're<00:01:50.310> playing<00:01:50.490> a

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
people especially if you're playing a

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.789 
people especially if you're playing a
lot<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.450> narrow<00:01:51.720> maps<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.320> for<00:01:52.680> whatever

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
lot of narrow maps and for whatever

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.560 
lot of narrow maps and for whatever
reason<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.549> kept<00:01:53.970> getting<00:01:54.060> on<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.390> map

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
reason I kept getting on the map

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.660 
reason I kept getting on the map
lakeside<00:01:55.350> last<00:01:55.619> night<00:01:55.860> which<00:01:56.250> as<00:01:56.340> much<00:01:56.490> as<00:01:56.610> I

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
lakeside last night which as much as I

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.819 
lakeside last night which as much as I
like<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.000> map<00:01:57.210> it's<00:01:57.689> not<00:01:57.899> good<00:01:58.140> for<00:01:58.170> ship<00:01:58.619> only

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
like the map it's not good for ship only

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.310 
like the map it's not good for ship only
because<00:01:59.070> it's<00:01:59.219> so<00:01:59.369> long<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.640> people<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.360> like

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
because it's so long and people I like

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.810 
because it's so long and people I like
on<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.740> don't<00:02:01.920> think<00:02:02.040> that's<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.250> good<00:02:02.280> ship

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
on it I don't think that's a good ship

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.999 
on it I don't think that's a good ship
only<00:02:03.090> man<00:02:03.450> because<00:02:04.049> I<00:02:04.170> kept<00:02:04.409> getting<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:04.860> last

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
only man because I kept getting it last

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.930 
only man because I kept getting it last
night<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:06.710> kept<00:02:07.710> having<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.190> play<00:02:08.520> that<00:02:08.729> map

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
night and I kept having to play that map

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.690 
night and I kept having to play that map
and<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.500> just<00:02:10.500> couldn't<00:02:10.679> get<00:02:10.800> good<00:02:11.039> games<00:02:11.310> on<00:02:11.550> it

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
and I just couldn't get good games on it

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.420 
and I just couldn't get good games on it
um<00:02:12.140> but<00:02:13.140> as<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.319> whole<00:02:13.709> really<00:02:13.950> this

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
um but as a whole really this

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.720 
um but as a whole really this
this<00:02:15.030> challenge<00:02:15.299> it<00:02:15.659> was<00:02:15.959> it<00:02:16.500> was<00:02:16.730> definitely

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
this challenge it was it was definitely

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.589 
this challenge it was it was definitely
more<00:02:18.030> difficult<00:02:18.599> than<00:02:18.719> the<00:02:18.870> melee<00:02:19.109> only<00:02:19.379> um<00:02:19.590> I

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
more difficult than the melee only um I

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.860 
more difficult than the melee only um I
actually<00:02:22.040> went<00:02:23.040> negative<00:02:23.640> two<00:02:24.120> games<00:02:24.420> doing

actually went negative two games doing
this<00:02:25.049> and<00:02:25.909> partly<00:02:26.909> because<00:02:27.120> well<00:02:28.019> I<00:02:28.230> I<00:02:28.650> kind<00:02:29.340> of

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
mean it was boring to watch and that's

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.330

way to describe how I was playing it was
it<00:03:56.970> was<00:03:57.150> pretty<00:03:57.419> boring<00:03:57.720> but<00:03:58.409> other<00:03:58.739> than<00:03:58.859> that

00:03:58.939 --> 00:03:58.949 
it was pretty boring but other than that

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:02.119 
it was pretty boring but other than that

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
but not as difficult as I thought was

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:05.780 
but not as difficult as I thought was
gonna<00:04:04.859> be<00:04:04.919> I<00:04:05.009> thought<00:04:05.189> I<00:04:05.220> was<00:04:05.370> going<00:04:05.489> to<00:04:05.669> be

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
gonna be I thought I was going to be

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.979 
gonna be I thought I was going to be
just<00:04:05.939> dying<00:04:06.500> every<00:04:07.500> every<00:04:08.750> couple<00:04:09.750> minutes

just dying every every couple minutes

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.610 
just dying every every couple minutes
trying<00:04:10.470> to<00:04:10.530> do<00:04:10.680> this<00:04:10.859> and<00:04:11.220> I<00:04:11.579> ended<00:04:11.790> up<00:04:12.620> having

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
trying to do this and I ended up having

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.559 
trying to do this and I ended up having
games<00:04:13.949> where<00:04:14.159> I<00:04:14.189> didn't<00:04:14.519> die<00:04:14.699> too<00:04:14.759> often<00:04:15.359> I

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
games where I didn't die too often I

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.899 
games where I didn't die too often I
actually<00:04:15.959> ended<00:04:16.229> up<00:04:16.440> leading<00:04:17.250> my<00:04:17.579> team<00:04:17.639> a

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:17.909 
actually ended up leading my team a

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:20.149 
actually ended up leading my team a
couple<00:04:18.299> times<00:04:18.509> doing<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:19.560> shift<00:04:19.769> challenge
