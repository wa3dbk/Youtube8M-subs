00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.750
 sometimes 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.540
 good beds at the request of a 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.580
 subscriber in this video I bring you one 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.980
 new delivery of what would have happened if 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.490
 in this I will comment that it had happened 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.500
 if fans had not come to marín four 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.480
 you already know that if you want I invented a 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.790
 story you just have to put in the 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.070
 comment box which one you would like 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.460
 and when I have time I'll upload it to 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.329
 channel 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.280
 thank you very much for participating maca more 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.740
 well what would have happened if fans did not 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.720
 I would have arrived at Marin Four 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.850
 at the moment when the redhead 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.490
 arrives at marin force light and it's already 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.590
 except thanks to kobe's speech so 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.570
 that in this theory lucy would continue with 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.940
 life that would not have changed because 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.270
 I would have given time to escape just like 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.790
 did what does change this theory is the 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.950
 Kobe's life the speech he gave 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.110
 to all the white-bearded pirates and the 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.270
 marine and interrupted has fallen on its 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.940
 chasing Jim Beily would have cost 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:10.040
 life to kazuki did not hesitate to try 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.590
 give a punch of magma to the 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.570
 novice and defenseless soldier of the navy 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.090
 but what saved him was the epic 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.060
 entrance of sants that in this case not 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.460
 therefore, the 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.830
 first important change would be death 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.320
 of kobe and with his death we would not have 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.360
 known an important characteristic of 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.640
 hack and that was commented when this one 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.530
 recovered after fainting and is that kobe 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.270
 yy sparked hack told him 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.490
 it could have been to pass a 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.680
 situation of extreme danger or perhaps 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.080
 for the presence of sans that as we saw 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.020
 is capable of fainting even pirates 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.630
 of the advance of white beard 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.000
 that way of transmitting the hack and I 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.159
 It seems very interesting and thanks to 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.189
 kobe ​​was saved was mentioned in one 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.500
 office at that time I think kobe is 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.869
 one of the characters with the most potential 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.119
 of the series his dream is contrary to that of 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.579
 light and nevertheless puts the same desire 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.579
 that he to fulfill it and possesses a force 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:08.979
 of unbreakable will besides we are 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:10.720
 shows from the beginning of the series and it 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.150
 they have shown us their changes and 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.250
 Workouts after the time skip will be 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.489
 has endowed with check even and it seems 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.650
 master it lutfi motivated this change in 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.959
 kobe ​​when he was just a boy and we can 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.540
 see the great potential and importance 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.750
 that someday will have in the series but I 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.610
 I think it will be for the next generation 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.709
 I mean, I do not see kobe doing 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.900
 something important from here to the end of the 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.510
 series but yes maybe if it shows us 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.819
 a future time skin in which he as 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.860
 Lucy has fulfilled her dream and has a 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:45.069
 great position in the Navy when the series 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.230
 I finished it, I imagine it like that 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.599
 following with the changes with the 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.459
 absence of stilts we would have that much 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:54.219
 the white-bearded pirates like the 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.579
 marine were completely exhausted and 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:59.170
 the two bands added many casualties 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:01.359
 then the curo band and that could 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.579
 have taken part in the battle and have 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:07.030
 tried to kill more users for 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:08.950
 get their fruits could even 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.109
 have killed sengoku if his fight 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.540
 I would have gone more or destroyed 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:15.669
 completely the island with the powers 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.269
 agur a nomi opens a fan 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:21.489
 of very broad possibilities in short 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:24.069
 I see a big change in the theory about 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.290
 all for kobe since he is a character in 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.510
 which has now focused several times on 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.989
 attention and it's showing up from the 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.329
 episode 1 of one piece of another form 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.250
 we can think what would have happened if funk 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.199
 had come before and there 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.260
 stopped the war avoiding the death of 

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:44.230
 as you imagine the series would have 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.269
 completely changed however the 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.290
 Ace's death was necessary in that 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.989
 moment 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.870
 good nothing else that's all in this video 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:55.209
 for the next episode I will bring you what 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.489
 would have happened if sengoku had not 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:01.980
 stopped to garde when a cain killed ace 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:04.830
 I hope you like it you knew that 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:08.069
 Kobe's birthday is on May 13 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.760
 like that of silver silent because 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.110
 you know 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.110
 a greeting nothing more 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.549
 why
