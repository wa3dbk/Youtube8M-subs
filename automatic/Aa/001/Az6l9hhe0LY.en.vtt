00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
vibrations and even when we dive deeper

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.210 
vibrations and even when we dive deeper
you<00:01:49.890> come<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.310> realize<00:01:50.460> as<00:01:50.909> well<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:52.009> we<00:01:53.009> live

than sword than fighting the pen is

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.610 
than sword than fighting the pen is
mightier<00:02:18.450> than<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.690> sword<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:19.349> that's

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
mightier than the sword and that's

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.110 
mightier than the sword and that's
simply<00:02:19.860> because<00:02:22.250> it's<00:02:23.250> not<00:02:23.519> just<00:02:23.549> the<00:02:23.849> words

can make us feel as any kind of way they
can<00:02:34.470> it<00:02:34.709> just<00:02:35.549> depends<00:02:36.060> on<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.239> energy<00:02:36.420> behind

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
can it just depends on the energy behind

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.470 
can it just depends on the energy behind
the<00:02:37.140> words<00:02:37.349> and<00:02:37.560> I<00:02:37.620> just<00:02:37.860> feel<00:02:38.010> that<00:02:38.069> a<00:02:38.459> lot<00:02:39.420> of

just amazing and just to see how

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.690 
just amazing and just to see how
advertisers<00:03:29.880> how<00:03:30.239> they<00:03:30.859> keep<00:03:31.859> humanity<00:03:32.190> in<00:03:32.579> a

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
advertisers how they keep humanity in a

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.690 
advertisers how they keep humanity in a
low<00:03:32.880> vibration<00:03:33.410> they<00:03:34.410> can<00:03:34.620> easily<00:03:35.430> manipulate

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
low vibration they can easily manipulate

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.110 
low vibration they can easily manipulate
the<00:03:36.120> words<00:03:36.359> and<00:03:37.280> arrange<00:03:38.280> them<00:03:38.459> in<00:03:38.579> a<00:03:38.669> sequence

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
the words and arrange them in a sequence

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.390 
the words and arrange them in a sequence
but<00:03:39.359> for<00:03:39.540> me<00:03:39.690> I'm<00:03:40.260> just<00:03:40.919> using<00:03:41.609> words<00:03:42.120> to<00:03:43.400> keep

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
but for me I'm just using words to keep

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.449 
but for me I'm just using words to keep
balance<00:03:44.700> keeping<00:03:45.510> that<00:03:45.599> neutral<00:03:45.870> state<00:03:46.470> and<00:03:46.739> I

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
balance keeping that neutral state and I

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.390 
balance keeping that neutral state and I
think<00:03:47.760> that<00:03:47.910> a<00:03:47.940> lot<00:03:48.209> of<00:03:48.359> us<00:03:48.859> we<00:03:49.859> just<00:03:49.889> forget

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
think that a lot of us we just forget

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.099 
think that a lot of us we just forget
that<00:03:50.549> whatever<00:03:50.940> we<00:03:51.150> say<00:03:51.480> will<00:03:52.310> haunt<00:03:53.310> us

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:54.109 
that whatever we say will haunt us

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:56.240 
that whatever we say will haunt us
because<00:03:55.109> it's<00:03:55.290> like<00:03:55.470> a<00:03:55.500> lot<00:03:55.769> of<00:03:55.799> people<00:03:55.980> they

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
because it's like a lot of people they

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.430 
because it's like a lot of people they
don't<00:03:56.370> take<00:03:56.669> back<00:03:56.940> words<00:03:57.780> you<00:03:58.079> can't<00:03:58.349> take

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
don't take back words you can't take

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.750 
don't take back words you can't take
back<00:03:58.560> words<00:03:58.980> and<00:03:59.190> that's<00:03:59.250> why<00:03:59.459> they<00:03:59.609> always

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
back words and that's why they always

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.369 
back words and that's why they always
say<00:03:59.910> be<00:04:00.209> careful<00:04:00.599> what<00:04:00.720> you<00:04:00.750> say<00:04:00.870> to<00:04:01.049> someone

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
say be careful what you say to someone

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:04.009 
say be careful what you say to someone
because<00:04:01.739> once<00:04:02.549> that<00:04:02.910> leaves<00:04:03.239> your<00:04:03.510> mouth<00:04:03.690> then

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
because once that leaves your mouth then

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.809 
because once that leaves your mouth then
that's<00:04:04.230> it<00:04:04.440> you<00:04:04.620> can't<00:04:04.889> do<00:04:05.069> anything<00:04:05.519> and<00:04:05.669> a

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
that's it you can't do anything and a

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.059 
that's it you can't do anything and a
lot<00:04:05.970> of<00:04:06.000> times<00:04:06.359> we<00:04:06.959> remember<00:04:07.560> from<00:04:07.769> childhood

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069
