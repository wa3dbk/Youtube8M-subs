00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.349
 Well, I'm here again in the 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.000
 university nebrija I have stayed with toni 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.890
 cuquerella that is going to talk about the effect 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.240
 ground and the genius good since we're going 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.610
 talk about the effect I'm just going to bring 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.800
 this lotus with which there is everything has been 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.259
 achieved the first victory in the year 85 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.790
 in estoril in rain because history a 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:29.790
 single effect making machine 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.920
 this soil and brought you the car 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:40.719
 best took the effect is not made are 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.670
 nice but this one has very nice 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:45.429
 yes slopes but these cars what 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.249
 it was fantastic besides the moment the 

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:50.320
 lotus equipment has the floor effect and the 

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:52.780
 ground effect that for people to 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.219
 understand is a bit like it was getting no 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.409
 you are going to explain to me exactly how 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:58.929
 which car will be paid as a limpet 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:00.489
 exact ground the ground effect is what 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:02.109
 it happens to airplanes also when 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.550
 fly very close to the ground the effect 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:05.199
 I usually be there are many parts of 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.240
 the dynamics are treated effect 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.010
 floor that is that effect of you're 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.870
 approaching the ground and a life in a 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.250
 position is going to fly in a way 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.050
 but one when it is very close to the ground 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.000
 change all the forces that it receives 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.720
 because the soil is exerting a 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.370
 reaction with 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.950
 against the plane because in theory the 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.000
 ground effect we have here in the part of 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.410
 down this car is not very well 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.270
 achieved but if you see the part of 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.120
 back that we had two big tunnels 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.310
 that pass below I think it was 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.850
 to get was to pass air through 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.560
 underneath that many times were two tunnels 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.270
 that they got two tunnels because they did not 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.210
 could do the whole car that all the 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.800
 car out one wing upside down these two 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.540
 channels had a problem also a 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.850
 problem to improve its performance is 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.280
 putting side slots with that 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.630
 that they were able to create a channel 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.970
 completely under the hermetic car 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.400
 all the air that came in came out without 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.930
 had interaction of the laterals the 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.250
 problem is that they started running 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.930
 a lot of cars were made 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.570
 sophisticated a little dangerous too 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.119
 and the fia said from there we started 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.380
 with the flat bottom this is one of the 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.030
 larger changes that the 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.979
 formula one when the effect was removed 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.720
 floor and they said now you have to go with a 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.180
 flat bottom as we have regulated in 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.380
 the formula one obviously now has 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.209
 that play differently but the air 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.490
 now he is able to sides and enter 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.930
 does different things in these cars I have 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.069
 got the workshop our cars 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.129
 first he was in 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.959
 or the curve was super fast, even 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.579
 they said that the life of the 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.379
 pilot because he could get to lose 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.670
 the knowledge of train forces in 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:32.260
 the ones I had and I think the other 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.420
 serious problem that had that this was 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.129
 a sucker stuck to the ground but when 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.019
 they caught a bats a curb they touched 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.900
 with someone and the car was getting up and 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.310
 the suction cup disappeared then this is 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.159
 the problem that these cars had 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.889
 it's a situation as simple as taking 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:51.099
 a high speed curve 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:52.930
 let's say 240 260 and on that curve in half 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.579
 of the curve the pilot instead of plotting 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.680
 where I wanted to trace trace a little 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:59.109
 inside and plays the piano with the piano 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.359
 that are just 45 centimeters are 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:04.090
 enough to lift the car that 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:07.599
 the flaps no longer touch the ground and you 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.310
 car that could go to 240 that curve of 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.699
 suddenly it can not happen to more than 180 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.859
 years 

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:15.699
 let's see with a state experiment 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:17.290
 scientific and clear if it is costing a 

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:18.639
 pasta this section this section the 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:26.109
 truth is that we are not leaving everything I 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:28.150
 I do not know look at that thing they gave us 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:29.439
 that zero budget march not even 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.489
 you have bought we have not control or 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:31.930
 free day 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.829
 so we 're seeing these blocks 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.829
 from the coffee shop 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:43.720
 is going out then let's simulate that 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.159
 this is a steel tunnel this car 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.979
 look in this sense that you have it now 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:49.599
 this would be the tunnel one of the two 

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:52.359
 tunnels that would have here another and this 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:54.489
 it would be formula 1 but obviously not 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:57.099
 It has a wing shape and air passing through 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:04:00.989
 underneath I should already do something that you think 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.989
 what should I do this 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.590
 if fast air passes and below in 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:11.229
 The paperback theory is far from leaving 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:16.419
 up will stick more to the ground let's go 

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:18.219
 to see if you are able to under what 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.290
 we have to see is that this piece of paper 

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:22.190
 have to 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.510
 lumbar but do not cheat is blown 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.040
 started it did not start blowing anymore I'm 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.720
 cheating that I see you coming no 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.090
 surprise up because people could 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.860
 think about the clear yes blow the edge 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.110
 that's why it sinks, we see that it's a 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.090
 normal paper but it blows 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.500
 right in there so that the air that you 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.500
 you have everything goes under 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.350
 and we see how it sinks 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.030
 and we know how it is folding doubling 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.890
 all of below there's less pressure so 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.570
 so much that is the effect that we were 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.720
 looking if in addition to this we add a 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.920
 little diffuser yet more I'm 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.010
 waiting for you with this straw 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.930
 imagine at 300 heat or a car at 309 and 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.030
 this makes that if today we see how is a 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.490
 Formula 1 right now we could say 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.290
 the 30 or all this this did not come until 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.480
 always on the blackboard this is always 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:14.270
 here this would be a formula 1 as we see 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.520
 more or less with 2013 regulation more or 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.440
 less everything very schematic and we see that 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.240
 the side pontoons usually have this 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.400
 way they come down and the car is flat 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.680
 completely and a small diffuser of 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.570
 back that starts from the axis that is what 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.040
 which allows us the federation now 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:31.470
 we erase 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:34.470
 and we loaded the pontoon and we say how 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.270
 it would be the car if we could have 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.480
 effect floor a car with floor effect and 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.550
 do not have more pontoons do not have more 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.630
 the background completely flat so what 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.600
 first what we would do would be the 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:50.740
 pontoons would have this way 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:54.069
 they would reach a low part but then 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:57.620
 they would reach the end and above 

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:59.840
 we would like the most 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:03.780
 straight possible 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:05.550
 as you see we have created a wing 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.840
 let's take the ground effect and we 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.330
 we fly to the cafeteria that I think 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.560
 that here in the old 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:15.020
 but good to know nothing of the sandwich 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.020
 also and his name 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.590
 ah
