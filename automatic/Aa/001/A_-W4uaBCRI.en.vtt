00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
why the power belt bullet is so

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.090 
why the power belt bullet is so
effective<00:00:26.430> on<00:00:26.580> game<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.230> so<00:00:28.230> popular<00:00:28.890> all

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
over the world if you're ready I'm ready

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.319 
over the world if you're ready I'm ready
I'm<00:00:31.350> ready<00:00:31.410> all<00:00:31.800> right<00:00:31.920> let's<00:00:32.579> face<00:00:32.789> it<00:00:32.850> before

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
I'm ready all right let's face it before

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.510 
I'm ready all right let's face it before
the<00:00:33.449> power<00:00:33.690> belt<00:00:33.989> came<00:00:34.320> along<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.920> used<00:00:35.309> to

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
the power belt came along I used to

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.750 
the power belt came along I used to
saboted<00:00:36.120> bullet<00:00:36.530> really<00:00:37.530> hard<00:00:37.859> to<00:00:38.010> load<00:00:38.219> well

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
saboted bullet really hard to load well

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.120 
saboted bullet really hard to load well
like<00:00:39.239> we<00:00:39.359> talked<00:00:39.600> about<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:40.380> the<00:00:40.620> sabot<00:00:41.010> has

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.130 
like we talked about that the sabot has

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.440 
like we talked about that the sabot has
that<00:00:41.310> cup<00:00:41.489> that<00:00:41.670> comes<00:00:41.820> all<00:00:41.970> the<00:00:42.060> way<00:00:42.149> around

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
that cup that comes all the way around

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.610 
that cup that comes all the way around
it<00:00:42.630> and<00:00:42.750> that's<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.140> only<00:00:43.170> thing<00:00:43.380> that

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
it and that's the only thing that

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.380 
it and that's the only thing that
engages<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.100> rifling<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:44.880> it<00:00:45.000> basically

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
engages the rifling so it basically

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.819 
engages the rifling so it basically
takes<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.809> same<00:00:45.989> energy<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.380> push<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.710> down

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
takes the same energy to push it down

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.650 
takes the same energy to push it down
the<00:00:46.890> barrel<00:00:47.130> as<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.730> come<00:00:48.149> back<00:00:48.300> out<00:00:48.450> the

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
the barrel as it is to come back out the

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.450 
the barrel as it is to come back out the
barrel<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.140> our<00:00:49.290> bullet<00:00:49.649> has<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.950> gas<00:00:50.130> check

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
barrel so our bullet has the gas check

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.549 
barrel so our bullet has the gas check
attached<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.300> base<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.809> bullet<00:00:52.200> itself

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
attached to the base the bullet itself

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.470 
attached to the base the bullet itself
can<00:00:52.739> be<00:00:52.829> slightly<00:00:53.250> under<00:00:53.489> bore<00:00:53.700> diameter<00:00:54.270> so

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
can be slightly under bore diameter so

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.200 
can be slightly under bore diameter so
it<00:00:54.570> loads<00:00:54.750> really<00:00:55.290> easy<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.489> then<00:00:56.880> on<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.090> way

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
it loads really easy and then on the way

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.930 
it loads really easy and then on the way
out<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:58.110> gas<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.559> ignited<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.670> bullet

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
out the gas is ignited the bullet

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.459 
out the gas is ignited the bullet
operates<00:01:00.450> our<00:01:00.600> fountains<00:01:00.930> up<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.140> engages

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
operates our fountains up and engages

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.950 
operates our fountains up and engages
the<00:01:01.590> rifling<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.340> comes<00:01:02.550> out<00:01:02.760> engaged<00:01:03.540> and

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
the rifling so it comes out engaged and

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.429 
the rifling so it comes out engaged and
again<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:05.090> reinforces<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.439> consistency

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
again that reinforces that consistency

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.940 
again that reinforces that consistency
and<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.619> accuracy<00:01:08.219> then<00:01:08.579> that's<00:01:08.909> right<00:01:09.149> yeah

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
and that accuracy then that's right yeah

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.560 
and that accuracy then that's right yeah
while<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.159> first<00:01:11.310> time<00:01:11.579> I<00:01:11.610> loaded<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.180> sabot

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
while the first time I loaded a sabot

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.200 
while the first time I loaded a sabot
was<00:01:12.750> difficult<00:01:13.350> after<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:14.280> first<00:01:14.460> shot<00:01:14.729> it

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
was difficult after the first shot it

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.490 
was difficult after the first shot it
was<00:01:15.360> next<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.720> impossible

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
was next to impossible

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.649 
was next to impossible
what's<00:01:16.799> going<00:01:17.040> on<00:01:17.130> well<00:01:17.729> like<00:01:18.270> we<00:01:18.420> talked

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
what's going on well like we talked

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.899 
what's going on well like we talked
about<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.350> plastic<00:01:19.830> on<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.070> sabot<00:01:20.430> surrounds

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
about the plastic on the sabot surrounds

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.130 
about the plastic on the sabot surrounds
the<00:01:21.030> bullet<00:01:21.270> that's<00:01:21.390> what's<00:01:21.630> engaging<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
the bullet that's what's engaging the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.109 
the bullet that's what's engaging the
rifling<00:01:22.530> when<00:01:23.010> it<00:01:23.130> comes<00:01:23.310> out<00:01:23.460> at<00:01:23.580> velocity

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
rifling when it comes out at velocity

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.789 
rifling when it comes out at velocity
it's<00:01:24.450> stripping<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:24.990> plastic<00:01:25.409> off<00:01:25.530> and

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
it's stripping that plastic off and

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.530 
it's stripping that plastic off and
leaving<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.460> rifle<00:01:26.790> so<00:01:27.090> it's<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.299> dirty

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
leaving it in the rifle so it's a dirty

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.410 
leaving it in the rifle so it's a dirty
barrel<00:01:27.960> but<00:01:28.590> with<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> power<00:01:29.100> belt<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.760> can<00:01:30.060> shoot

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
barrel but with a power belt I can shoot

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.480 
barrel but with a power belt I can shoot
like<00:01:30.720> six<00:01:31.110> seven<00:01:31.409> eight<00:01:31.530> times<00:01:31.770> without<00:01:32.310> ever

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
like six seven eight times without ever

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.399 
like six seven eight times without ever
cleaning<00:01:33.060> that's<00:01:33.540> right<00:01:33.780> how<00:01:33.930> am<00:01:34.020> i<00:01:34.140> able<00:01:34.290> to

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
cleaning that's right how am i able to

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.410 
cleaning that's right how am i able to
accomplish<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:35.130> with<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.340> power<00:01:35.610> belt<00:01:35.820> well

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
accomplish that with a power belt well

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.940 
accomplish that with a power belt well
we<00:01:36.509> don't<00:01:36.659> have<00:01:36.720> any<00:01:36.960> plastic<00:01:37.229> fouling<00:01:37.770> in<00:01:37.860> the

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
we don't have any plastic fouling in the

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.590 
we don't have any plastic fouling in the
barrel<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.850> flow<00:01:39.060> it's<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.270> whole<00:01:39.450> lot

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
barrel so it flow it's a whole lot

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.330 
barrel so it flow it's a whole lot
easier<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:40.110> just<00:01:40.320> doesn't<00:01:40.619> leave<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.159> the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
easier it just doesn't leave that in the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.530 
easier it just doesn't leave that in the
barrel<00:01:41.520> where<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:41.820> needs<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.030> be<00:01:42.090> cleaned<00:01:42.390> all

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
barrel where it needs to be cleaned all

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.410 
barrel where it needs to be cleaned all
the<00:01:42.570> time<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.770> bullet<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.520> engaging<00:01:45.060> the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
the time so the bullet is engaging the

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.570 
the time so the bullet is engaging the
rifling<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.140> not<00:01:46.409> plastic<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.159> that's<00:01:47.310> why

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
rifling and not plastic and that's why

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.310 
rifling and not plastic and that's why
the<00:01:47.640> other<00:01:47.939> shots<00:01:48.270> are<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:48.659> important<00:01:49.170> that's

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
the other shots are so important that's

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.600 
the other shots are so important that's
right<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.860> you're<00:01:49.950> not<00:01:50.100> going<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.280> strip<00:01:50.490> the

right and you're not going to strip the

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.160 
right and you're not going to strip the
copper<00:01:50.939> off<00:01:51.090> like<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.390> do<00:01:51.509> plastic<00:01:51.960> in<00:01:52.079> the

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
copper off like you do plastic in the

bullet<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:55.950> different<00:01:56.520> in<00:01:56.670> superior<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.960> the

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
bullet so different in superior to the

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.499 
bullet so different in superior to the
saboted<00:01:58.560> bullet<00:01:58.860> well<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.759> bullet<00:02:00.000> itself<00:02:00.360> is

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
saboted bullet well the bullet itself is

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.120 
saboted bullet well the bullet itself is
completely<00:02:00.810> designed<00:02:01.439> from<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.740> ground<00:02:01.770> up

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
completely designed from the ground up

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.100 
completely designed from the ground up
for<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.400> muzzle<00:02:02.759> loader<00:02:02.790> that's<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.869> first

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
for a muzzle loader that's the first

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.550 
for a muzzle loader that's the first
thing

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
thing

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.100 
thing
now<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:04.979> saboted<00:02:05.759> bullet<00:02:06.060> has<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.540> cup<00:02:06.899> that

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
now the saboted bullet has a cup that

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.539 
now the saboted bullet has a cup that
surrounds<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.649> bullet<00:02:07.860> itself<00:02:08.250> so<00:02:08.399> the

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:08.549 
surrounds the bullet itself so the

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:10.160 
surrounds the bullet itself so the
bullet<00:02:08.789> doesn't<00:02:09.060> engage<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.450> rifling<00:02:09.840> then

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
bullet doesn't engage the rifling then

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.559 
bullet doesn't engage the rifling then
it<00:02:10.319> has<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.500> gas<00:02:11.310> seal<00:02:11.730> at<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.150> base<00:02:12.329> of<00:02:12.360> the

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
it has a gas seal at the base of the

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.869 
it has a gas seal at the base of the
sabot<00:02:13.019> the<00:02:13.650> power<00:02:13.829> belt<00:02:14.099> bullet<00:02:14.370> is<00:02:14.489> designed

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
sabot the power belt bullet is designed

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.720 
sabot the power belt bullet is designed
the<00:02:15.120> bullet<00:02:15.360> itself<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:15.900> engage<00:02:16.109> the<00:02:16.230> rifling

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
the bullet itself to engage the rifling

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.099 
the bullet itself to engage the rifling
then<00:02:17.730> we<00:02:18.029> have<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.329> gas<00:02:18.510> check<00:02:18.870> which<00:02:19.079> is

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:19.109 
then we have the gas check which is

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:20.629 
then we have the gas check which is
attached<00:02:19.559> to<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:19.799> base<00:02:20.040> of<00:02:20.099> the<00:02:20.340> bullet<00:02:20.459> to

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:20.639 
attached to the base of the bullet to

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:21.250 
attached to the base of the bullet to
give<00:02:20.819> it<00:02:20.879> a<00:02:20.939> perfect

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
give it a perfect

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.199 
give it a perfect
gasps<00:02:21.439> he'll<00:02:21.739> well<00:02:22.519> what<00:02:22.700> does<00:02:22.819> the<00:02:22.939> perfect

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
gasps he'll well what does the perfect

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.420 
gasps he'll well what does the perfect
gasps<00:02:23.510> he'll<00:02:23.780> do<00:02:24.019> for<00:02:24.230> us<00:02:24.379> well<00:02:24.920> it<00:02:25.040> does<00:02:25.189> a<00:02:25.220> lot

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
gasps he'll do for us well it does a lot

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.979 
gasps he'll do for us well it does a lot
of<00:02:25.610> things<00:02:25.819> that<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.239> most<00:02:26.360> important<00:02:26.840> thing

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
of things that the most important thing

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.280 
of things that the most important thing
is<00:02:27.170> is<00:02:27.459> velocity<00:02:28.459> all<00:02:28.790> of<00:02:29.120> the<00:02:29.269> the<00:02:29.810> powder<00:02:30.049> one

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
is is velocity all of the the powder one

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.229 
is is velocity all of the the powder one
is<00:02:30.379> ignited<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:30.980> gases<00:02:31.189> that<00:02:31.430> energy<00:02:32.150> is

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
is ignited the gases that energy is

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.119 
is ignited the gases that energy is
transferred<00:02:32.750> to<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:33.049> bullet<00:02:33.319> itself<00:02:33.650> so

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129 
transferred to the bullet itself so

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:35.770 
transferred to the bullet itself so
you're<00:02:34.250> getting<00:02:34.459> higher<00:02:34.700> velocities<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.569> and

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
you're getting higher velocities and and

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.199 
you're getting higher velocities and and
more<00:02:36.200> consistent<00:02:36.860> velocities<00:02:37.370> alright<00:02:38.060> we've

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
more consistent velocities alright we've

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.970 
more consistent velocities alright we've
achieved<00:02:40.060> consistency<00:02:41.060> correct<00:02:41.690> okay<00:02:41.980> what

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
achieved consistency correct okay what

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.350 
achieved consistency correct okay what
does<00:02:43.069> that<00:02:43.129> translate<00:02:43.459> to<00:02:43.940> to<00:02:44.269> the

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
does that translate to to the

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.809 
does that translate to to the
performance<00:02:44.959> okay<00:02:45.590> it<00:02:45.799> means<00:02:46.190> everything<00:02:46.730> in

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
performance okay it means everything in

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:48.880 
performance okay it means everything in
performance<00:02:47.420> because<00:02:47.900> you're<00:02:48.290> constantly

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
performance because you're constantly

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.740 
performance because you're constantly
getting<00:02:49.129> the<00:02:49.280> same<00:02:49.549> burn<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:49.970> same<00:02:50.180> push<00:02:50.510> on

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
getting the same burn the same push on

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.210 
getting the same burn the same push on
the<00:02:50.870> bullet<00:02:51.140> basically<00:02:51.590> so<00:02:51.739> you<00:02:51.769> get<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.040> same

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
the bullet basically so you get the same

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.039 
the bullet basically so you get the same
velocities<00:02:52.879> so<00:02:53.239> you<00:02:53.299> have<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.510> same<00:02:53.720> point<00:02:53.989> of

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
velocities so you have the same point of

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.119 
velocities so you have the same point of
impact<00:02:54.349> downrange

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:55.129 
impact downrange

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:57.130 
impact downrange
there's<00:02:55.430> no<00:02:55.579> gases<00:02:56.150> getting<00:02:56.420> past<00:02:56.659> the<00:02:56.870> bullet

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
there's no gases getting past the bullet

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.599 
there's no gases getting past the bullet
at<00:02:57.230> one<00:02:57.379> time<00:02:57.650> and<00:02:57.829> then<00:02:57.890> all<00:02:58.040> getting<00:02:58.340> checks

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:58.609 
at one time and then all getting checks

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:00.129 
at one time and then all getting checks
the<00:02:58.760> next<00:02:59.090> they're<00:02:59.450> all<00:02:59.599> getting<00:02:59.870> stopped

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:00.139 
the next they're all getting stopped

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:02.619 
the next they're all getting stopped
behind<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:00.739> bullet<00:03:01.040> so<00:03:01.579> every<00:03:02.060> shots<00:03:02.329> the

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629

performer a few moments ago you talked

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.220 
performer a few moments ago you talked
about<00:06:01.580> the<00:06:01.760> difference<00:06:02.210> in<00:06:02.360> a<00:06:02.480> sabot<00:06:03.020> and<00:06:03.169> a

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:03.230 
about the difference in a sabot and a

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.590 
about the difference in a sabot and a
power<00:06:03.560> bill<00:06:03.980> and<00:06:04.250> you<00:06:04.430> mentioned<00:06:04.910> knockdown

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600 
power bill and you mentioned knockdown

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.290 
power bill and you mentioned knockdown
power<00:06:06.190> if<00:06:07.190> that's<00:06:07.370> a<00:06:07.490> big<00:06:07.640> part<00:06:07.850> of<00:06:08.000> it<00:06:08.150> and<00:06:08.240> our

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.300 
power if that's a big part of it and our

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.790 
power if that's a big part of it and our
bullets<00:06:08.630> designed<00:06:08.990> to<00:06:09.110> do<00:06:09.260> that<00:06:09.410> at<00:06:09.530> muzzle

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 
bullets designed to do that at muzzle

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.740 
bullets designed to do that at muzzle
loader<00:06:09.919> velocities<00:06:10.550> but<00:06:11.000> the<00:06:11.150> big<00:06:11.330> thing<00:06:11.570> is

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 
loader velocities but the big thing is

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.320 
loader velocities but the big thing is
in<00:06:11.930> a<00:06:11.990> nutshell<00:06:12.169> is<00:06:12.560> that<00:06:13.130> the<00:06:13.280> saboted<00:06:14.030> bullet

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.330 
in a nutshell is that the saboted bullet

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.670 
in a nutshell is that the saboted bullet
because<00:06:14.540> it<00:06:14.630> has<00:06:14.750> that<00:06:14.870> plastic<00:06:15.020> cuff<00:06:15.530> around

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 
because it has that plastic cuff around

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.740 
because it has that plastic cuff around
it<00:06:15.980> okay<00:06:16.220> it<00:06:16.490> has<00:06:16.640> to<00:06:16.669> be<00:06:16.880> under<00:06:17.090> bore<00:06:17.270> diameter

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
it okay it has to be under bore diameter

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.270 
it okay it has to be under bore diameter
so<00:06:17.900> if<00:06:17.990> you're<00:06:18.110> shooting<00:06:18.350> a<00:06:18.590> 50<00:06:18.950> caliber

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 
so if you're shooting a 50 caliber

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.159 
so if you're shooting a 50 caliber
muzzle<00:06:19.580> loader<00:06:19.730> you're<00:06:20.180> shooting<00:06:20.480> only<00:06:20.540> a<00:06:20.660> 45

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:21.169 
muzzle loader you're shooting only a 45

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:23.260 
muzzle loader you're shooting only a 45
caliber<00:06:21.500> bullet<00:06:21.919> with<00:06:22.220> a<00:06:22.250> power<00:06:22.669> belt<00:06:22.910> bullets

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 
caliber bullet with a power belt bullets

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.000 
caliber bullet with a power belt bullets
they're<00:06:23.630> actually<00:06:23.960> only<00:06:24.110> one<00:06:24.380> one<00:06:24.530> thousandth

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.010 
they're actually only one one thousandth

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.560 
they're actually only one one thousandth
of<00:06:25.040> an<00:06:25.160> inch<00:06:25.250> under<00:06:25.610> bore<00:06:25.850> diameters<00:06:26.330> with<00:06:26.480> a

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:26.570 
of an inch under bore diameters with a

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:28.540 
of an inch under bore diameters with a
load<00:06:26.780> easy<00:06:26.990> so<00:06:27.290> you<00:06:27.320> have<00:06:27.800> a<00:06:27.919> 50<00:06:28.190> caliber

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.550 
load easy so you have a 50 caliber

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.520 
load easy so you have a 50 caliber
you're<00:06:28.669> getting<00:06:28.910> a<00:06:28.970> 50<00:06:29.360> caliber<00:06:29.780> bullet<00:06:30.169> so

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:30.530 
you're getting a 50 caliber bullet so

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:31.900 
you're getting a 50 caliber bullet so
when<00:06:30.650> you<00:06:30.740> hit<00:06:30.830> the<00:06:30.980> animal<00:06:31.280> it<00:06:31.370> hits<00:06:31.520> it<00:06:31.640> hard

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:31.910 
when you hit the animal it hits it hard

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:34.570 
when you hit the animal it hits it hard
it's<00:06:32.570> a<00:06:32.660> bigger<00:06:33.080> bullet<00:06:33.440> and<00:06:33.710> more<00:06:34.190> knockdown

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:34.580 
it's a bigger bullet and more knockdown

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.210 
it's a bigger bullet and more knockdown
