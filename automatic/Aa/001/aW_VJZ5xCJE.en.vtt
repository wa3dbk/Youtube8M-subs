00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:03.850
 but 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:09.280
 the huge cinema the Asus Netbook the deep sea 12 15 percent 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.400
 is one of the first models with a Nvidia two graphics card ever 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.060
 automatically turns on and off according to claim and high-resolution 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.189
 Video footage smoothly in a thousand 80 p on the TV again 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:30.359
 Inside the Asus netbook is an Intel Pentium d525 processor with one 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.550
 Comma 8 gigahertz which consists of two cores and therefore more powerful than 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.659
 the usual nice processors is the memory is 2gb can be 

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:45.550
 but easily expand to up to four gigawatts enough space for their 

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:49.949
 personal data looks like the approximately 233 gigabytes of hard drive 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.240
 the monitor of the Epi has a screen diagonal of twelve 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:01.090
 Comma one inch at a maximum resolution of 13 66 times 7 68 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.830
 Pixels due to the aspect ratios of 16 to 9 can 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.690
 they enjoy films almost undisturbed by the black bars 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.100
 extraordinary for a netbook the 12 15 Ana has two graphics processors 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.840
 For example, they work with office software or surf in the board 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.910
 Internet sufficed Emma main processor sitting intel-graphic chip stands 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.220
 Game or a high-resolution movies on the program turns off 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.210
 Automatically the NWDR graphics processor is one of the big advantage of netbook that 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.810
 that they have a very long battery life 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.310
 big disadvantage is that they are very powerful 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.170
 that means the puppies do not get on with the process before the Empire example 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.490
 to be able to play the material the netbook also has a stronger one 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.980
 Graphics cards in this case, it works very well, however, you need 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.840
 special software then this graphics card for the calculation as well 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.469
 uses good services rendered here in the field test 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:59.840
 the free software Media Player Classic Home Cinema 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.640
 such as the paid software Power DVD 10 Ultra by 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.210
 CyberLink 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.770
 the connections on the left side are a VW connection 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:17.490
 hdmi output a usb socket and a 2-in-1 memory card reader device right 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.050
 find a network connection two more USB interfaces as well 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.360
 Connections for microphone and headphones Contact with the outside world takes that 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.400
 mini-notebook via w-lan to fast n-standard or via ethernet LAN 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.230
 Great for video calling and appreciates the built-in zero comma 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.230
 3-megapixel webcam plus microphone 

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:42.180
 but the catch is that the device costs 5 or euros of it 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.689
 a relatively much for such a small device which he is honorary second device 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:50.719
 and is a buy recommendation Buy recommendation is only if you 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:54.469
 really used the money there player if you do not need to do that 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:56.199
 not strong graphics card 

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:58.259
 and there is a cheap alternative
