00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.969 
that happen and appear throughout each
chapter<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:51.960> that's<00:01:52.110> basically<00:01:52.320> how<00:01:52.619> this

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
chapter and that's basically how this

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.010 
chapter and that's basically how this
game<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.280> all<00:01:53.549> set<00:01:53.790> up<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.479> it's<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.780> book

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
game is all set up is that it's a book

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.929 
game is all set up is that it's a book
so<00:01:55.229> you're<00:01:55.380> interacting<00:01:55.740> with<00:01:56.280> this<00:01:56.460> book<00:01:56.729> and

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
so you're interacting with this book and

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.940 
so you're interacting with this book and
basically<00:01:57.360> going<00:01:57.600> from<00:01:57.719> page<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.140> page<00:01:58.439> the

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
basically going from page to page the

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.399 
basically going from page to page the
page<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.490> then<00:01:59.850> ultimately<00:02:00.090> each<00:02:00.750> monster

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
page and then ultimately each monster

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.039 
page and then ultimately each monster
kind<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.680> represents<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.430> new<00:02:02.700> chapter<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.540> so

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
kind of represents a new chapter and so

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.020 
kind of represents a new chapter and so
you<00:02:04.110> can<00:02:04.290> go<00:02:04.439> ahead<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.799> play<00:02:05.310> this<00:02:05.340> game<00:02:05.759> and

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
you can go ahead and play this game and

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.240 
you can go ahead and play this game and
it's<00:02:06.180> not<00:02:06.360> about<00:02:06.570> this<00:02:06.899> scoring<00:02:07.409> or<00:02:07.829> anything

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
it's not about this scoring or anything

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.699 
it's not about this scoring or anything
like<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.459> it's<00:02:09.209> really<00:02:09.479> about<00:02:09.690> just<00:02:09.899> did<00:02:10.590> you

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
like that it's really about just did you

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.260 
like that it's really about just did you
add

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
add

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.570 
add
what<00:02:11.660> it<00:02:11.780> was<00:02:11.990> that<00:02:12.230> you<00:02:12.260> needed<00:02:12.860> to<00:02:13.070> do<00:02:13.280> it's

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
what it was that you needed to do it's

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.490 
what it was that you needed to do it's
not<00:02:13.760> about<00:02:14.060> how<00:02:14.330> fast<00:02:14.540> you<00:02:14.990> did<00:02:15.170> it<00:02:15.260> or<00:02:15.440> how

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
not about how fast you did it or how

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.590 
not about how fast you did it or how
will<00:02:16.070> you<00:02:16.310> did<00:02:16.460> it<00:02:16.550> by<00:02:16.700> any<00:02:16.910> means<00:02:17.180> it's<00:02:17.480> just

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
will you did it by any means it's just

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.660 
will you did it by any means it's just
did<00:02:18.050> you<00:02:18.170> do<00:02:18.350> it<00:02:18.560> you<00:02:18.830> know<00:02:18.980> and<00:02:19.220> I<00:02:19.370> think<00:02:19.430> their

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
did you do it you know and I think their

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.460 
did you do it you know and I think their
lives<00:02:19.880> definitely<00:02:20.690> something<00:02:21.020> that<00:02:21.050> a<00:02:21.200> lot<00:02:21.290> of

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
lives definitely something that a lot of

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.880 
lives definitely something that a lot of
kids<00:02:21.950> will<00:02:22.430> respond<00:02:23.300> well<00:02:23.600> to<00:02:23.630> as<00:02:24.110> well<00:02:24.590> as<00:02:24.740> of

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
kids will respond well to as well as of

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.860 
kids will respond well to as well as of
course<00:02:24.920> you<00:02:25.430> know<00:02:25.520> adults<00:02:26.000> will<00:02:26.180> like<00:02:26.420> that<00:02:26.660> as

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
course you know adults will like that as

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.110 
course you know adults will like that as
opposed<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:27.530> really<00:02:27.830> being<00:02:28.070> like<00:02:28.370> hounding

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
opposed to really being like hounding

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.890 
opposed to really being like hounding
and<00:02:29.380> grading<00:02:30.380> these<00:02:30.830> their<00:02:31.640> children<00:02:32.240> on<00:02:32.420> how

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
and grading these their children on how

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.630 
and grading these their children on how
well<00:02:33.200> they<00:02:33.350> played<00:02:33.650> these<00:02:33.890> video<00:02:34.220> games<00:02:34.280> I

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
well they played these video games I

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.770 
well they played these video games I
think<00:02:34.820> that<00:02:34.940> that's<00:02:35.030> definitely<00:02:35.480> a<00:02:35.540> feature

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
think that that's definitely a feature

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.780 
think that that's definitely a feature
that<00:02:35.900> they'll<00:02:36.260> be<00:02:36.440> very<00:02:36.590> happy<00:02:36.740> that<00:02:37.520> they

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
that they'll be very happy that they

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.240 
that they'll be very happy that they
mitigated<00:02:38.420> with<00:02:38.840> this<00:02:39.110> particular<00:02:39.380> Sesame

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
mitigated with this particular Sesame

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.250 
mitigated with this particular Sesame
Street<00:02:40.580> game<00:02:40.910> anyway<00:02:41.420> that's<00:02:41.660> basically<00:02:42.140> it

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
Street game anyway that's basically it

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.720 
Street game anyway that's basically it
so<00:02:42.560> I<00:02:42.590> definitely<00:02:42.830> recommend<00:02:43.130> that<00:02:43.460> adults
