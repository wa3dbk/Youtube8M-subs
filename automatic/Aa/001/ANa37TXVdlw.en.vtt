his<00:00:57.989> complaints<00:00:58.940> he<00:00:59.940> was<00:01:00.180> assuming<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.410> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
his complaints he was assuming that the

his complaints he was assuming that the
Xbox<00:01:02.010> she<00:01:02.219> Xbox<00:01:02.910> 720<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.739> obviously<00:01:04.739> well<00:01:04.949> I

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
Xbox she Xbox 720 and obviously well I

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.039 
Xbox she Xbox 720 and obviously well I
guess<00:01:05.460> just<00:01:05.760> Sony<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.270> Microsoft's<00:01:06.780> next

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.870 
guess just Sony and Microsoft's next
consoles<00:01:07.500> were<00:01:07.860> going<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.130> be<00:01:08.250> more<00:01:08.490> powerful

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
consoles were going to be more powerful

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.149 
consoles were going to be more powerful
than<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.330> Wii<00:01:09.510> U<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.799> they<00:01:10.920> were<00:01:10.979> going

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
than the Wii U and that they were going

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.980 
than the Wii U and that they were going
to<00:01:11.220> be<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:11.640> far<00:01:11.909> ahead<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.630> Wii<00:01:12.780> U<00:01:12.930> is

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
to be so far ahead that the Wii U is

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.780 
to be so far ahead that the Wii U is
going<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.200> look<00:01:13.350> like<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.530> piece<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.830> shit<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.460> a
