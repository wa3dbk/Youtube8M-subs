00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
shoot them they like collapse until the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:33.069 
shoot them they like collapse until the
bone<00:01:31.639> pile<00:01:32.030> then<00:01:32.420> you<00:01:32.509> have<00:01:32.630> to<00:01:32.719> do<00:01:32.840> it<00:01:32.959> again

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
bone pile then you have to do it again

bone pile then you have to do it again
and<00:01:33.920> again<00:01:34.270> it<00:01:35.270> takes<00:01:35.539> forever<00:01:35.840> shield

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649
