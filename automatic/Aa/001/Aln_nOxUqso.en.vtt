channel and welcome to V today - today I

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.440 
channel and welcome to V today - today I
wanted<00:00:07.680> to<00:00:07.950> talk<00:00:08.220> to<00:00:08.370> you<00:00:08.460> about<00:00:08.580> chia<00:00:09.090> seeds

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
wanted to talk to you about chia seeds

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.200 
wanted to talk to you about chia seeds
real<00:00:09.780> quick<00:00:10.050> I'm<00:00:10.349> not<00:00:10.710> sure<00:00:10.889> if<00:00:11.190> any<00:00:11.969> of<00:00:12.059> you

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
real quick I'm not sure if any of you

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.150 
real quick I'm not sure if any of you
have<00:00:12.360> heard<00:00:12.599> of<00:00:12.690> chia<00:00:12.929> seeds<00:00:13.230> before<00:00:13.469> I'm<00:00:13.920> sure

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
have heard of chia seeds before I'm sure

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.650 
have heard of chia seeds before I'm sure
you've<00:00:14.280> probably<00:00:14.490> heard<00:00:14.759> of<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.030> chia<00:00:15.330> pet

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
you've probably heard of the chia pet

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.890 
you've probably heard of the chia pet
and<00:00:15.990> so<00:00:16.410> pretty<00:00:16.680> much<00:00:16.949> it's<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.400> seed<00:00:17.910> from

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
and so pretty much it's the seed from

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:26.240 
and so pretty much it's the seed from
the<00:00:19.699> chia<00:00:20.699> pet<00:00:21.510> plant<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:23.840> my<00:00:24.840> friend<00:00:25.289> Sandra

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
the chia pet plant and my friend Sandra

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.640 
the chia pet plant and my friend Sandra
I<00:00:26.340> went<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.640> visit<00:00:26.820> her<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.300> she<00:00:27.869> made<00:00:28.320> me

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
I went to visit her and she made me

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.950 
I went to visit her and she made me
drink<00:00:29.220> this<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.849> at<00:00:29.939> first<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.330> was<00:00:30.359> like<00:00:30.510> what

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
drink this and at first I was like what

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.959 
drink this and at first I was like what
in<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.170> world<00:00:31.279> but<00:00:32.279> let<00:00:32.430> me<00:00:32.489> see<00:00:32.610> if<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.759> can

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
in the world but let me see if I can

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.080 
in the world but let me see if I can
show<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:36.890> it's<00:00:37.890> like<00:00:38.070> really<00:00:38.460> really<00:00:38.730> small

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
show you it's like really really small

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.860 
show you it's like really really small
seeds<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:40.520> they<00:00:41.520> are<00:00:41.820> really<00:00:43.219> beneficial<00:00:44.219> for

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
seeds and they are really beneficial for

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.930 
seeds and they are really beneficial for
she<00:00:45.870> gave<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.289> me<00:00:46.440> for<00:00:46.770> energy<00:00:47.430> that's<00:00:47.760> what

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
she gave it to me for energy that's what

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.670 
she gave it to me for energy that's what
she<00:00:48.090> told<00:00:48.300> me<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.690> helps<00:00:49.140> with<00:00:49.320> energy<00:00:49.530> and

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
she told me it helps with energy and

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.439 
she told me it helps with energy and
something<00:00:52.680> doing<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.309> for<00:00:53.489> about<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.850> month<00:00:54.120> now

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
something doing it for about a month now

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.830 
something doing it for about a month now
and<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:56.059> I've<00:00:57.059> been<00:00:57.300> doing<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.600> for<00:00:57.719> energy

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
and so I I've been doing it for energy

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.080 
and so I I've been doing it for energy
and<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.170> have<00:00:58.199> also<00:00:58.590> noticed<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.309> have<00:00:59.670> lost

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
and I have also noticed that I have lost

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.500 
and I have also noticed that I have lost
weight<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:02.219> after<00:01:03.000> doing<00:01:03.149> some<00:01:03.359> more

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
weight and so after doing some more

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.969 
weight and so after doing some more
research<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:03.960> realized<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.619> does<00:01:04.799> help

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
research I realized that it does help

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.490 
research I realized that it does help
you<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.129> lose<00:01:05.400> weight<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:06.360> seeds<00:01:07.049> are<00:01:07.320> really

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
you to lose weight the seeds are really

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.620 
you to lose weight the seeds are really
packed<00:01:07.920> with<00:01:08.220> antioxidants<00:01:09.680> protein<00:01:10.680> calcium

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
packed with antioxidants protein calcium

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.590 
packed with antioxidants protein calcium
so<00:01:12.630> many<00:01:13.200> um<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:14.100> many<00:01:14.310> things<00:01:14.640> they<00:01:15.150> help<00:01:15.450> you

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
so many um so many things they help you

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.740 
so many um so many things they help you
to<00:01:16.170> stay<00:01:16.439> full<00:01:16.860> longer<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.299> has<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.479> lot<00:01:18.720> of

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
to stay full longer and it has a lot of

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.039 
to stay full longer and it has a lot of
fiber<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.680> all<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.850> what<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.270> do<00:01:21.479> is

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
fiber and all of that so what I do is

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.440 
fiber and all of that so what I do is
generally<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.650> use<00:01:23.040> juice<00:01:23.430> but<00:01:23.850> today<00:01:24.180> I'm

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
generally I use juice but today I'm

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.440 
generally I use juice but today I'm
gonna<00:01:24.960> use<00:01:25.380> water<00:01:25.770> just<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.280> show<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:27.330> you

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
gonna use water just to show you so you

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.520 
gonna use water just to show you so you
just<00:01:27.780> get<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.049> glass<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.590> water<00:01:28.799> like<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.430> and

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
just get a glass of water like this and

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:39.130 
just get a glass of water like this and
I<00:01:33.020> usually<00:01:34.020> use<00:01:36.020> about<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.229> tablespoon<00:01:37.650> and

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
I usually use about a tablespoon and

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.539 
I usually use about a tablespoon and
generally<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.170> put<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.680> juice<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.340> just

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
generally I put it in juice and you just

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.370 
generally I put it in juice and you just
put<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:41.850> in<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.060> water

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.080 

and<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:47.280> leave<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.880> for<00:01:47.909> like<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:49.640> little<00:01:50.640> bit<00:01:50.790> for

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
and I leave it for like a little bit for

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.749 
and I leave it for like a little bit for
like<00:01:51.270> 15<00:01:52.110> minutes<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.619> just<00:01:52.649> set<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.159> timer<00:01:53.490> on

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
like 15 minutes I just set the timer on

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.740 
like 15 minutes I just set the timer on
my<00:01:53.790> stove<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.689> what<00:01:55.530> happens<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.719> the<00:01:57.770> the

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
my stove and what happens is the the

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.170 
my stove and what happens is the the
seeds<00:02:00.750> start<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.500> kind<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:02.040> break<00:02:02.579> down<00:02:02.610> and

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
seeds start to kind of break down and

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.300 
seeds start to kind of break down and
dissolve<00:02:03.570> not<00:02:04.380> really<00:02:04.619> dissolved<00:02:05.040> they<00:02:05.130> don't

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
dissolve not really dissolved they don't

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.340 
dissolve not really dissolved they don't
do<00:02:05.430> so<00:02:05.579> but<00:02:05.820> they<00:02:05.969> break<00:02:06.210> down<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.659> they<00:02:06.930> form

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
do so but they break down and they form

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.550 
do so but they break down and they form
this<00:02:07.619> because<00:02:08.340> this<00:02:08.729> one<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.119> one<00:02:09.300> that

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
this because this one is one that

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.490 
this because this one is one that
had<00:02:09.860> up<00:02:10.340> for<00:02:10.729> about<00:02:10.910> 15<00:02:11.300> minutes<00:02:11.510> they<00:02:12.020> formed

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
had up for about 15 minutes they formed

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.020 
had up for about 15 minutes they formed
this<00:02:12.620> kind<00:02:12.890> of<00:02:13.010> gel<00:02:13.610> like<00:02:15.760> jelly<00:02:16.760> like

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
this kind of gel like jelly like

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.170 
this kind of gel like jelly like
substance<00:02:17.470> around<00:02:18.470> seed<00:02:19.310> and<00:02:19.670> it<00:02:19.849> becomes

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
substance around seed and it becomes

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.900 
substance around seed and it becomes
easier<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:20.930> it's<00:02:21.440> easy<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:21.920> digest<00:02:22.160> it<00:02:22.700> has<00:02:22.880> a

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
easier and it's easy to digest it has a

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.400 
easier and it's easy to digest it has a
lot<00:02:23.150> of<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.360> same<00:02:23.630> benefits<00:02:24.200> as<00:02:24.349> flaxseed<00:02:25.330> so

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
lot of the same benefits as flaxseed so

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.770 
lot of the same benefits as flaxseed so
it's<00:02:27.410> a<00:02:27.530> good<00:02:27.769> alternative<00:02:28.310> to<00:02:28.819> black<00:02:29.120> seed

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
it's a good alternative to black seed

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
probably just pass it out unless you

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.970 
probably just pass it out unless you
kind<00:02:38.030> of<00:02:38.209> grind<00:02:38.510> it<00:02:38.720> but<00:02:39.230> you<00:02:39.319> can<00:02:39.470> do<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.739> chia
