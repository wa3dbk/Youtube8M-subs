00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.030
 hello guys welcome to this man 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.929
 of the view the one between three moggi and the 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.119
 shelf mod 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.460
 this is a mod that in my opinion is 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.680
 very important as a fashion even if a 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.390
 in fact, first impact would not appear 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.580
 as soon as I explain to you what I will do 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.840
 sure that pretty much all of those 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:34.410
 you will say that it is a right way of 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.719
 beauty and does not have a utility the 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.969
 always if but it's right to do cool 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.829
 let's say it's actually not so 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.980
 because a utility has it and there is 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.170
 I will explain shortly but first what it does 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.480
 this mode this is not a mod that 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.160
 adds minecraft shelves to the 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.789
 shelves in which we can store the 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.739
 our objects and see them put to see 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.820
 also aesthetically as I am 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.730
 can store any kind of 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.140
 object here and then see how it is 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:05.220
 looking at what's inside are like 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.990
 you have what you are seeing now it is now 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.270
 what is this world for? 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.670
 the usefulness of this way we make a 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.729
 example then let's put the case I put 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.790
 on my minecraft jar le rob reiner 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.840
 brain just appeared in front of me and me 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.790
 he wants to kill me he wants to trap 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.810
 how to save the song all mine 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.150
 stuff in the baskets but I don't know in which ces 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.299
 I have no idea in those chest is mine 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.180
 armor so I'll have to run to 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.369
 baskets and look in which in which of the 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.890
 basket hidden my armor since 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.990
 maybe not ordered I have no idea 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.840
 what is therefore wasting time e 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.649
 that time could possibly cost me the 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.479
 game 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.600
 or better if you are in hard core vi 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.240
 therefore it will cost the world 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.140
 let's say it's a very bad thing if 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:01.049
 die for because of these distractions 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.770
 let's say this way it does come to you 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:07.489
 meeting by introducing these 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.360
 prophetic shelves and shelves marni e 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:12.120
 we have the possibility to see immediately 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.920
 what is contained therefore if that is theirs 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.730
 brand that is chasing you that knocks me 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.670
 at the door of the house 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.830
 I run a shelf right away and take the 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.709
 necessary and I prepare to fight 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.319
 so i take everything in and 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:28.739
 prepares me to fight in the brands 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:32.090
 crew I immediately start all all 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:34.650
 the armor so it seemed for the attack is 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.810
 having said this saying we can move on 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.260
 to the specificity of fashion as I said 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.090
 this fashion adds shelves to 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:48.360
 four different materials 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:50.670
 ie woods and wood stone and brics eo 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.560
 obsidian as it is created between these 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.120
 shelves this ms go cascato 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.650
 obviously from a weak crafting 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.750
 obligatory anzio not 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.400
 mandatory what I say is not 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.739
 necessary signs in a card in the 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.420
 ball you can buy them here you have to 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.959
 put the material with which they are made 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.720
 exactly like that 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:15.600
 the form of l doing so you will 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:19.019
 you can create your put you can 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.090
 also stack them so let's say not 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:26.160
 you have of which you have no problems like 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.750
 maybe it happens with water bags 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.640
 however all the objects that are not 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:36.570
 stackable so you have that too 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:39.000
 this facilitation we say and therefore vi 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.260
 makes everyone know how to give up 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.739
 always the same for all types of 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:49.130
 materials does not change at all 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:49.130
 nothing always so-so-so 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:04:00.420
 no no oh well we lost it 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:04:00.420
 and then the last is the wood point totò totò 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.310
 so you want to place your libraries 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.720
 as best you like then when many 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.209
 focuses on square objects 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.440
 of the object where you prefer e 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:15.820
 have fun placing all yours 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:18.370
 objects inside so randomly put like 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.140
 in short, you prefer in short, vi 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.800
 this mode will be very useful again 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:25.270
 sure that you have changed your mind now 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.730
 at least I hope for what you may have 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.440
 thought it was useless actually there 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.050
 I assure you it will come in handy 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.320
 especially if you are playing maybe 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.540
 hard core or you have to be 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.220
 be careful what you do since 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.470
 I really think it could cost you 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:45.160
 the game is a distraction especially 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.960
 all the red catechetes after that is if 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.360
 die maybe you lost a world was later 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.790
 started getting pissed off but this fad 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.919
 as I said, then it comes to you 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.510
 I will not dwell too much I hope that 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:58.479
 so you enjoyed it even though it wasn't 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:01.060
 it has nothing special but you are looking for 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:02.890
 to understand that the 1.4.2 exit from 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.400
 relatively little therefore practically 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:10.810
 almost all the fashions are still at the 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:14.200
 1.3.2 so I have no possibility to do 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:16.900
 1.4.2 the other firm because we do not 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.970
 are the fashions and except these here that 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.010
 they are quite basic so I don't 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:24.240
 dwell too we feel a next 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.240
 moder view and hello to all
