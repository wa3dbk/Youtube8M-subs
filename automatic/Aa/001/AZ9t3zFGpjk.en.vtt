00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:05.470
 a match marked by returns the one who dreams of livio monnin the romillon 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.389
 absent from the grounds for almost a year after a ligament rupture 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:09.769
 crossed 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.499
 but it was also the return of josh man showed him he the old 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:16.749
 executioner million the partners of choice when leaving the shock in 

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:19.949
 start of the meeting the two teams realizing for shot 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:24.759
 however, it will hurry somewhat in this first period 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:29.810
 if five dead remains in range thanks obviously an unemployed montreal author 

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:32.430
 three goals in a row for his training 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.040
 romilly is however more rigorous 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.880
 more dexterous in his attempts 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.190
 of frédéric gouin not joining the locker room with a five-goal advantage 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.450
 the 15 10 in the Mauritian locker room she stood out that gives her 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.500
 instructions for the second half 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.680
 he conceded his life had not let himself come 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.340
 the trade and did not let them play the euro progressed to 1 euro but 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.460
 their combinations were rejected 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.460
 it's not about looking at my interlocutor 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.600
 he was a man despite progress in the game this plan must quickly 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.860
 dropped flag in front of the guardian products have once again too much 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:10.880
 great shape 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.350
 Jeremy criteria and everything that comes up and allows his team to 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.680
 take off because in front 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.930
 or very closely offensive waste 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.930
 possible cards a bus tour midway 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.080
 hoffmann tries well then to bring back his partners to the score but the backs 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.130
 for it will not cost much either with including a window noise 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.450
 from a near-east 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.370
 more hope for the players as I prepare 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.330
 at the exam 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.440
 the rhdp doorman why 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.240
 all the penaltys at various a dark plot I feel 11 hours 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.050
 it is with the body measures today at the moment 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.660
 libya who have attacked 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.730
 in this report made to the military of their freewheeling in front of 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.179
 Mauritians discouraged 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:58.990
 victory for the blue 29 20 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.909
 I think that today we can be extremely satisfied we took 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:03.460
 a goal 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.790
 it is with these words that it happens to us good defensively we were very strong 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.100
 in terms of percentage of shots on goal were also excellent against 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.739
 to that 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.510
 for sure, when we kept it behind that, it helps to go 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.510
 to the end with his first time 

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:23.569
 it was a bit more punchy in the locker room 41 the European authorities 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.449
 have fallen heavily 

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:28.809
 a victory that places three million less than 25% why 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:30.469
 the romillons 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:32.740
 we take a big step towards maintaining the contrary 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.210
 the holy death which sinks a little more
