00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.980
 Hello you and welcome 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.000
 to a new video of game with flour 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.280
 toys 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.349
 I have this super cool today 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.630
 toys for you you wonder 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:18.050
 surely what that is is one 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:21.210
 Water bomb pump with 200 water bombs 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:24.810
 manufactured by cp was and suitable for 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.609
 Children over three years sees the device 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.619
 below is it 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:33.180
 actually like a drinking bottle and 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:36.989
 above is such a tap or more one 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.809
 you have to screw it on 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.670
 Fill the bottle with water and use it 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.550
 would have this mark here is max 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.550
 So maximum up to here with water 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.739
 fill and then pump and as soon as you do 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.010
 then you can pump here in front 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.410
 a balloon or a water bomb on it 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.899
 save and then, so to speak, a valve 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.570
 open and then the water runs here 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.440
 automatically by this cock in ours 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.059
 water exchange 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.030
 I would say we try it all 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.970
 normal and see if they 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.049
 really works as described 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.090
 so I have ours now 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.580
 Water bomb pump filled with water 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.229
 up to this maximum mark and 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.000
 Of course, before all of us 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.570
 water bombs from our bottle 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.479
 come 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.310
 that are now 200 pieces in super 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.580
 bright colors so i believe i 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.080
 Never have such glowing water 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.200
 so really obsessed in weeks 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.360
 neon orange neon orange neon pink and 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.439
 green so it's really right 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.530
 beautiful summer colors and now again too 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.060
 our water pump here is pumping 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.860
 with water film we did that 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:49.159
 build up pressure by pumping several times 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.960
 Tighten the balloon to the sounds and hold on 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.780
 Press lever and balance carefully 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.130
 fill balloon so knot what we as 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.590
 Doing the next thing is through 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.860
 build pump several times pressure 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.500
 that sounds kinda complicated to know 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:08.220
 we will see if it works 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:12.560
 they will now build pressure by 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.560
 Press the pump and then the lever 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.739
 still correctly how it takes to blubber then 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.090
 we have a water bomb I am now 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.090
 decided for themselves 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:49.950
 keep exciting about our plan here 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:52.040
 she firmly and squeezed on it and then 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.040
 you have already like that better 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.040
 flows 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.540
 I think that's kind of pretty 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.910
 cool makes water fight in any case 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.590
 in the much easier Wasserburg 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.800
 Giant always used to be with me 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.959
 faucet torn because these have 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.920
 but was quite wide and the opening 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:29.410
 from the water bomb so small 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:31.269
 Now I'm sure of a cinema de 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.260
 also a really cool toy for 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:37.299
 the garden 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:39.780
 I would make the problems quite a small one 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.780
 selection 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:21.170
 then we decide again for one 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:27.850
 water bomb I take now save here 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:27.850
 she presses here and 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:02.560
 somehow it makes fun when 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:04.440
 you just balance the water a bit 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.810
 But this definitely works 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.919
 quite fun, I must say I would 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.470
 say I 'm just going to do it now 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:14.800
 few balloons and then we see each other 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:17.319
 so again i have each one now 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.410
 try water-color bombs once 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:22.419
 the at her blue yellow green pink purple 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.330
 and orange so I'm definitely 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:28.210
 now armed for my water fight 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.889
 and all those bombshells will 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.500
 now throw from kathi 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:34.539
 Of course that was a joke I hope 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.699
 I liked my video 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:38.919
 but leave a lonely high one 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:40.270
 comment and for the time being, of course not 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:44.340
 to subscribe to the channel 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.340
 See you next time
