00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
much so far in my opinion and he hasn't

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.600 
much so far in my opinion and he hasn't
changed<00:01:39.810> many<00:01:40.110> laws<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.860> he's<00:01:41.340> trying<00:01:41.549> to

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
changed many laws and he's trying to

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.999 
changed many laws and he's trying to
push<00:01:41.820> for<00:01:42.150> health<00:01:42.509> care<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:42.990> in<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.560> United

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
push for health care and in the United

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.460 
push for health care and in the United
States<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.610> nationalized<00:01:45.509> healthcare<00:01:45.869> system

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
States a nationalized healthcare system

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.710 
States a nationalized healthcare system
but<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.310> think<00:01:47.579> so<00:01:47.880> far<00:01:48.119> that's<00:01:48.270> really<00:01:48.600> the

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
but I think so far that's really the

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.179 
but I think so far that's really the
only<00:01:48.750> thing<00:01:49.110> he's<00:01:49.229> done<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.590> he's<00:01:49.619> also<00:01:49.829> had<00:01:50.159> a

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
only thing he's done and he's also had a
