00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
especially with the laser but I will say

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.810 
especially with the laser but I will say
it's<00:02:04.710> it's<00:02:04.950> kind<00:02:05.219> of<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.340> tough<00:02:05.490> choice<00:02:05.670> because

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
maybe go back and forth but you know

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.100 
maybe go back and forth but you know
that<00:02:23.190> that's<00:02:23.430> that<00:02:23.580> soul<00:02:24.510> is<00:02:24.720> gonna<00:02:24.900> look

really<00:02:25.610> trashed<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:27.390> know<00:02:27.510> after<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:28.020> few

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
really trashed you know after a few

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.400 
really trashed you know after a few
years<00:02:28.290> wearing<00:02:28.950> it<00:02:29.660> yellowing<00:02:30.660> and<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:31.140> could

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
years wearing it yellowing and it could

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.640 
years wearing it yellowing and it could
take<00:02:31.560> away<00:02:31.800> from<00:02:32.160> from<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.760> shoe<00:02:33.030> so<00:02:33.810> so<00:02:34.380> for

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
take away from from the shoe so so for

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.650 
take away from from the shoe so so for
me<00:02:34.769> it's<00:02:35.040> like<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.489> I<00:02:35.550> think<00:02:36.030> this<00:02:36.120> is<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.360> tough

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
me it's like I I think this is a tough

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.180 
me it's like I I think this is a tough
choice<00:02:36.870> if<00:02:37.170> people<00:02:37.500> are<00:02:37.590> making<00:02:37.739> that<00:02:37.980> choice

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
choice if people are making that choice

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.820 
choice if people are making that choice
ah<00:02:38.489> you<00:02:39.239> got<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.480> lasers<00:02:39.840> I<00:02:40.140> believe<00:02:40.440> price

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
ah you got the lasers I believe price

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.229 
ah you got the lasers I believe price
points<00:02:41.220> 250<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.780> foamposites<00:02:43.849> they<00:02:44.849> might<00:02:45.090> be

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
points 250 the foamposites they might be

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.380 
points 250 the foamposites they might be
250<00:02:45.870> as<00:02:45.959> well<00:02:46.170> not<00:02:46.380> sure<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:47.220> exact<00:02:47.489> price<00:02:47.760> 235

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
250 as well not sure the exact price 235

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.680 
250 as well not sure the exact price 235
22<00:02:49.290> 250<00:02:49.680> so<00:02:50.370> you<00:02:50.549> look<00:02:51.000> at<00:02:51.090> your<00:02:51.269> essentially

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
22 250 so you look at your essentially

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.449 
22 250 so you look at your essentially
paying<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.350> same<00:02:52.560> price<00:02:52.860> so<00:02:53.100> it's<00:02:53.250> just<00:02:53.310> a

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
paying the same price so it's just a

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.490 
paying the same price so it's just a
matter<00:02:53.489> of<00:02:54.019> what<00:02:55.019> shoe<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:56.280> want<00:02:57.380> to<00:02:58.380> be

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
matter of what shoe you want to be

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.280 
matter of what shoe you want to be
honest<00:02:58.830> I<00:02:58.950> I<00:02:58.980> think<00:02:59.489> like<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.849> the<00:03:00.290> cooler

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
honest I I think like the the cooler

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.699 
honest I I think like the the cooler
choice<00:03:01.560> if<00:03:01.769> you<00:03:01.890> ask<00:03:02.040> me<00:03:02.280> is<00:03:02.549> is<00:03:02.849> the<00:03:03.709> gold

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
choice if you ask me is is the gold

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.610 
choice if you ask me is is the gold
foams<00:03:05.120> I'm<00:03:06.120> sure<00:03:06.360> both<00:03:06.930> will<00:03:07.140> be<00:03:07.170> instant

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
foams I'm sure both will be instant

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.470 
foams I'm sure both will be instant
sellouts<00:03:08.010> but<00:03:08.610> I<00:03:08.640> almost<00:03:08.880> feel<00:03:09.030> like<00:03:09.090> of

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
sellouts but I almost feel like of

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.880 
sellouts but I almost feel like of
course<00:03:09.540> everyone's<00:03:10.260> gonna<00:03:10.349> be<00:03:10.440> going<00:03:10.680> for<00:03:10.830> the

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
course everyone's gonna be going for the

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.430 
course everyone's gonna be going for the
Jordan<00:03:11.310> pores<00:03:12.090> I<00:03:12.480> kind<00:03:12.930> of<00:03:12.959> feel<00:03:13.080> like<00:03:13.140> the

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
Jordan pores I kind of feel like the

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.460 
Jordan pores I kind of feel like the
gold<00:03:13.890> foams<00:03:14.220> could<00:03:15.000> it's<00:03:15.269> gonna<00:03:15.420> I<00:03:15.810> think<00:03:16.260> we

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
gold foams could it's gonna I think we

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.289 
gold foams could it's gonna I think we
have<00:03:16.500> a<00:03:16.620> little<00:03:16.860> bit<00:03:16.950> of<00:03:17.069> a<00:03:17.280> revival<00:03:18.120> of<00:03:18.150> the

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
have a little bit of a revival of the

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.020 
have a little bit of a revival of the
foamposite<00:03:18.540> honestly<00:03:19.320> like<00:03:19.560> you<00:03:20.340> know<00:03:20.459> we're

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
foamposite honestly like you know we're

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.210 
foamposite honestly like you know we're
talking<00:03:21.359> about<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.600> foams<00:03:21.840> like<00:03:22.260> I've<00:03:22.890> seen<00:03:23.190> a

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
talking about the foams like I've seen a

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.650 
talking about the foams like I've seen a
few<00:03:23.280> people<00:03:23.609> mr.<00:03:23.850> foamer<00:03:24.060> simpson<00:03:24.209> got<00:03:24.600> a
