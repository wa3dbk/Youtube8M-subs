00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.430
 so first of all you will surely 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.240
 ask yourself but what is it 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.940
 that those big ridiculous glasses 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.559
 exit back to the future and well 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.179
 this is none other than a device under the 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.450
 shape of a mask covering the eyes of 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.070
 the user called oculus rift 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.990
 true little revolution it allows to 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.300
 immerse yourself and literally dive 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.560
 in a long fantasized game in the 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.330
 science fiction movies this 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.310
 technology is finally available 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.849
 because the digital barrier is now 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.980
 easily crossable sea and where from 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.809
 comes this thing the one of magic in 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.730
 plastic that makes the gamer dream so much 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.950
 was born in 2012 thanks to the financing 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.110
 collaborative on the platform 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.420
 kickstarter in less than four hours 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.670
 the goal of 250 thousand dollars has been 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.140
 reached and these are finally 2.5 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.899
 millions of dollars that have been raised 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.730
 for this ambitious project placed on the 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.129
 muzzle his diving immersive glasses 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.870
 the user in the game the player lives 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.820
 so his adventure through the eyes of 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.140
 character that they almost embody 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.719
 as if he were the character himself 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.559
 so much immersion is strong 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.180
 this screen displays an image 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.830
 stereoscopically distorted numerically 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.240
 to reverse the distortion that created 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:12.180
 by two lenses located in front of 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.680
 every eye has a screen 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.250
 integrated 2 7 inches with a resolution 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.560
 of 1280 x 800 and a total weight of 250 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.210
 grams it comes with halo 2 3 pair 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.350
 of lentils a loss for 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.909
 people who do not have problems with 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.650
 view and two others for those who wear 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.119
 corrective lenses 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.530
 the headset is connected to a housing on 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.329
 which are connected via the port 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.759
 usb and dvi hdmi 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.020
 the video and feeding this little 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.119
 case adjusts the brightness 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.950
 contrast but also stamps and 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.299
 turn on the headphones 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.950
 once plugged in the internal screen of 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.930
 the opus within the display in two 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.090
 parts in order to get an image for 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.210
 each eye with a resolution of 640 on 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.880
 800 released this is the same process as the 3d 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.799
 stereoscopic to increase 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.720
 immersion the angle of view and 90 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.969
 degrees in horizontal and 110 degrees in 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.259
 diagonal is more than double the field 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.360
 of vision of most devices 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.250
 competitors 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.840
 to handle the movements of the head he 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.030
 uses a combination of the three axes 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.280
 gyroscope of accelerometers and 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.990
 magnetometers the accumulation of c3 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.310
 technologies allows for tracking 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.310
 movements as realistic as possible 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.520
 the response time of the headphones for a 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.870
 head movement and 2.4 milliseconds 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:26.240
 often a refresh rate 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.860
 clocked at 250 hertz for the moment 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.750
 the screen is only in simple hd the version 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.410
 should logically be in 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.360
 full hd 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.820
 the big pixels effect will be reduced 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.200
 but not completely erased the more the 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.970
 refresh rate of the position 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.340
 is given at 1000 hertz either all 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.160
 0.1 a millisecond for fluidity 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.540
 and maximum responsiveness soon 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.100
 usable directly via his 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.360
 smartphone the possibilities 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.390
 applications for developers 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.860
 are infinite finally do not hope you 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.780
 lower where you lean to see a 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.670
 object more closely the lack of sensor 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.930
 positioning on the glasses and the 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.550
 only group missing for immersion 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.470
 Total 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.850
 however a handful of irreducible 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.650
 developers thought about cutting the oculus 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.230
 rift with the controller idra on the 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.670
 torso or carpet turns omni clickz for 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.670
 a more than impressive result 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.570
 little note that still has its 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.220
 importance of using a helmet 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.840
 audio in five points is strongly 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.700
 advised in order to definitively 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.980
 plunge the player into the 3d universe 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.660
 current 2014 for less than 300 euros 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.549
 so you will be able to offer yourself a lot of 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.980
 sea ​​on land and a total disruption of 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.810
 your internal reign still at the stage of 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.640
 prototype the oculus trift already offers 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.989
 bluffing technical performance 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.000
 however, the instrument requires 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.470
 facility to so complex and remains a 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.450
 luxury gadget not necessarily within reach 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.560
 everyone it is difficult to 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.180
 withstand over an hour of play 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.549
 in a row and we can not either 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.500
 use it in a space that is not suitable for 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.810
 risk of anger tati denise him 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.459
 lending its porcelain base so 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.900
 that's how it works gentlemen 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.900
 you are satisfied yes captain
