I'll<00:00:15.490> be<00:00:15.640> demonstrating<00:00:15.820> how<00:00:16.480> to<00:00:16.510> purl

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:17.620 
I'll be demonstrating how to purl

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.500 
I'll be demonstrating how to purl
together<00:00:17.980> through<00:00:18.340> the<00:00:18.460> back<00:00:18.490> loop<00:00:18.700> is<00:00:19.450> a

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:19.510 
together through the back loop is a

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.390 
together through the back loop is a
decreased<00:00:20.140> stitch<00:00:20.410> that<00:00:20.740> will<00:00:20.890> take<00:00:21.160> two

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:21.400 
decreased stitch that will take two

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.679 
decreased stitch that will take two
stitches<00:00:21.940> and<00:00:22.270> make<00:00:23.260> them<00:00:23.770> into<00:00:24.010> one<00:00:24.570> so<00:00:25.570> two

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:25.689 
stitches and make them into one so two

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:27.480 
stitches and make them into one so two
purl<00:00:26.230> two<00:00:26.500> together<00:00:26.650> through<00:00:27.160> the<00:00:27.279> back<00:00:27.310> loop

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
purl two together through the back loop

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.089 
purl two together through the back loop
we<00:00:28.240> are<00:00:28.450> going<00:00:28.810> to<00:00:29.140> take<00:00:29.619> our<00:00:29.800> right<00:00:30.070> hand

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:30.099 
we are going to take our right hand

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:32.970 
we are going to take our right hand
needle<00:00:30.520> and<00:00:31.000> go<00:00:31.720> behind<00:00:31.930> the<00:00:32.349> first<00:00:32.680> stitch

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
needle and go behind the first stitch

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.729 
needle and go behind the first stitch
and<00:00:33.600> behind<00:00:34.600> the<00:00:34.690> second<00:00:35.050> set<00:00:35.170> so<00:00:35.320> you<00:00:35.379> will<00:00:35.620> go

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
and behind the second set so you will go

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:37.920 
and behind the second set so you will go
pass<00:00:36.010> go<00:00:36.400> behind<00:00:36.790> the<00:00:36.940> first<00:00:37.239> stitch<00:00:37.510> the

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
pass go behind the first stitch the

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.080 
pass go behind the first stitch the
second<00:00:38.350> stitch<00:00:38.590> and<00:00:38.920> then<00:00:39.610> we're<00:00:39.820> going<00:00:40.000> to

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.090 
second stitch and then we're going to

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.500 
second stitch and then we're going to
enter<00:00:40.270> the<00:00:40.480> back<00:00:40.900> loop<00:00:41.260> of<00:00:41.500> the<00:00:41.739> second<00:00:42.190> stitch

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
enter the back loop of the second stitch

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.240 
enter the back loop of the second stitch
followed<00:00:43.510> by<00:00:43.629> the<00:00:43.690> first<00:00:44.050> stitch<00:00:44.379> and<00:00:44.800> I'm

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
followed by the first stitch and I'm

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.920 
followed by the first stitch and I'm
going<00:00:45.400> to<00:00:45.430> turn<00:00:45.670> it<00:00:45.850> around<00:00:45.910> so<00:00:46.300> you<00:00:46.420> can<00:00:46.660> see

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
going to turn it around so you can see

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:52.549 
going to turn it around so you can see
what<00:00:47.080> that<00:00:47.110> looks<00:00:47.260> like<00:00:47.650> from<00:00:47.980> the<00:00:48.160> backside

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.610 

so<00:00:53.559> here<00:00:53.920> we<00:00:54.070> go<00:00:54.250> we<00:00:55.090> would<00:00:55.270> enter<00:00:55.719> the<00:00:56.020> second

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
so here we go we would enter the second

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.389 
so here we go we would enter the second
stitch<00:00:56.950> first<00:00:57.880> and<00:00:58.410> then<00:00:59.489> the<00:01:00.489> first<00:01:00.850> stitch

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
stitch first and then the first stitch

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.020 
stitch first and then the first stitch
do<00:01:03.399> that<00:01:03.550> again

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
do that again

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.740 
do that again
second<00:01:04.629> stitch<00:01:05.100> first<00:01:06.100> stitch<00:01:06.520> and<00:01:06.880> you<00:01:07.570> need

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
second stitch first stitch and you need

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.590 
second stitch first stitch and you need
to<00:01:07.899> come<00:01:08.140> out<00:01:08.670> when<00:01:09.670> I<00:01:09.759> turn<00:01:10.000> it<00:01:10.030> around<00:01:10.149> it

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
to come out when I turn it around it

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.749 
to come out when I turn it around it
needs<00:01:10.780> to<00:01:10.869> be<00:01:10.990> coming<00:01:11.350> from<00:01:11.680> back<00:01:12.310> to<00:01:12.340> front

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
needs to be coming from back to front

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:16.469 
needs to be coming from back to front
just<00:01:13.240> like<00:01:13.360> a<00:01:13.479> regular<00:01:13.780> purl<00:01:14.259> stitch<00:01:14.619> and<00:01:15.479> wrap

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479

your<00:01:16.660> yarn<00:01:16.720> around<00:01:17.020> and<00:01:17.560> purl<00:01:18.280> them<00:01:18.550> together

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
your yarn around and purl them together

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:21.330 
your yarn around and purl them together
that's<00:01:19.990> a<00:01:20.200> purl<00:01:20.470> two<00:01:20.680> together<00:01:20.830> through<00:01:21.220> the

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
that's a purl two together through the

that's a purl two together through the
back<00:01:21.369> loop<00:01:21.580> I'll<00:01:22.060> do<00:01:22.209> it<00:01:22.330> one<00:01:22.479> more<00:01:22.539> time<00:01:22.740> our

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
back loop I'll do it one more time our

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.620 
back loop I'll do it one more time our
right<00:01:24.069> hand<00:01:24.310> needle<00:01:24.520> will<00:01:24.819> go<00:01:24.850> behind<00:01:25.179> the
