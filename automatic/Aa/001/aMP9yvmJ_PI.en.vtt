00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.520 
show it to you in a sec oh yeah this
stuff<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.299> like<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.780> controls<00:02:19.200> on<00:02:19.410> the

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
stuff I like the controls on the

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.610 
stuff I like the controls on the
steering<00:02:19.590> wheel<00:02:19.980> so<00:02:20.989> controls<00:02:21.989> for<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.350> sound

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
steering wheel so controls for the sound

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.289 
steering wheel so controls for the sound
system<00:02:23.069> and<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.280> air<00:02:23.400> conditioning<00:02:23.819> system

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
system and the air conditioning system

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.479 
system and the air conditioning system
and<00:02:26.150> demister<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.330> a<00:02:27.360> hands-free

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
and demister I a hands-free

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.599 
and demister I a hands-free
voice-activated<00:02:29.489> telephone<00:02:31.040> and<00:02:32.040> then<00:02:32.250> your

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:32.609 
voice-activated telephone and then your

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:35.690 
voice-activated telephone and then your
choice<00:02:32.820> between<00:02:33.000> seeing<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.079> map<00:02:34.709> and<00:02:34.950> the

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
choice between seeing the map and the

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.680 
choice between seeing the map and the
info<00:02:36.680> systems<00:02:37.680> info<00:02:38.040> so<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:38.970> systems<00:02:39.329> info<00:02:39.630> is

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
info systems info so the systems info is

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:40.789 
info systems info so the systems info is
pretty<00:02:39.900> interesting<00:02:40.260> look<00:02:40.380> at<00:02:40.470> this<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:40.680> can

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
pretty interesting look at this you can

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.870 
pretty interesting look at this you can
see<00:02:40.980> at<00:02:41.579> the<00:02:41.670> top<00:02:41.850> there<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.209> engine<00:02:43.400> and<00:02:44.400> the

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
see at the top there the engine and the

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.330 
see at the top there the engine and the
battery<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:46.019> electric<00:02:46.320> motor<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:46.829> then

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
battery and the electric motor and then

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.949 
battery and the electric motor and then
this<00:02:47.579> thing<00:02:47.850> tracks<00:02:50.030> how<00:02:51.030> it's<00:02:51.209> doing<00:02:51.420> so<00:02:51.780> just

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
this thing tracks how it's doing so just

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.319 
this thing tracks how it's doing so just
watch<00:02:52.109> this<00:02:52.410> you<00:02:52.950> can<00:02:53.130> see<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:54.000> power<00:02:54.239> is

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
watch this you can see the power is

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.180 
watch this you can see the power is
coming<00:02:54.510> from<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.870> battery<00:02:55.230> that<00:02:55.470> blew<00:02:55.799> the

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
coming from the battery that blew the

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.560 
coming from the battery that blew the
thing<00:02:56.220> that<00:02:56.519> the<00:02:56.609> blue<00:02:56.730> lines<00:02:56.940> is<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.239> battery

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
thing that the blue lines is the battery

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.020 
thing that the blue lines is the battery
so<00:02:58.170> it's<00:02:58.320> using<00:02:58.709> power<00:02:59.100> from<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.640> battery

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
so it's using power from the battery

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.479 
so it's using power from the battery
into<00:03:00.269> the<00:03:00.450> electric<00:03:00.750> motor<00:03:01.340> if<00:03:02.340> you

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
into the electric motor if you

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.759 
into the electric motor if you
accelerate<00:03:02.970> or<00:03:03.600> start<00:03:04.350> to<00:03:04.470> use<00:03:04.590> a<00:03:04.620> lot<00:03:04.680> of

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
accelerate or start to use a lot of

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.530 
accelerate or start to use a lot of
power<00:03:05.010> it<00:03:05.340> automatically<00:03:05.760> switches<00:03:05.940> to<00:03:06.299> the

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
power it automatically switches to the

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.270 
power it automatically switches to the
combustion<00:03:07.170> engine<00:03:09.650> which<00:03:10.650> you'll<00:03:10.890> see<00:03:10.920> in<00:03:11.190> a

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
combustion engine which you'll see in a

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.240 
combustion engine which you'll see in a
minute<00:03:11.430> I'll<00:03:12.390> just<00:03:12.750> so<00:03:13.590> it's<00:03:13.709> a<00:03:13.739> bit<00:03:13.859> shaky

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
minute I'll just so it's a bit shaky

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.220 
minute I'll just so it's a bit shaky
guys<00:03:14.430> obviously<00:03:14.880> we're<00:03:15.480> moving<00:03:15.959> we're<00:03:16.079> in<00:03:16.140> the

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
guys obviously we're moving we're in the

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.830 
guys obviously we're moving we're in the
traffic<00:03:16.700> so<00:03:17.700> yeah<00:03:17.850> it<00:03:17.940> really<00:03:18.120> slow<00:03:18.450> speeds

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
traffic so yeah it really slow speeds

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.690 
traffic so yeah it really slow speeds
around<00:03:19.170> town<00:03:19.470> it<00:03:19.709> uses<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.130> electric<00:03:20.190> and

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
around town it uses the electric and

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.640 
around town it uses the electric and
there<00:03:21.420> we<00:03:21.540> are<00:03:21.660> you<00:03:21.870> can<00:03:21.989> see<00:03:22.170> it's<00:03:22.380> switched

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
there we are you can see it's switched

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.180 
there we are you can see it's switched
over<00:03:22.829> to<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.040> combustion<00:03:23.370> and<00:03:23.760> it

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
over to the combustion and it

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.410 
over to the combustion and it
it's<00:03:26.190> recharging<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.180> battery<00:03:28.730> so<00:03:29.730> you<00:03:30.209> can

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
it's recharging the battery so you can

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.170 
it's recharging the battery so you can
actually<00:03:30.959> choose<00:03:31.350> electric<00:03:31.980> but<00:03:32.310> if<00:03:32.579> you<00:03:32.910> try

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
actually choose electric but if you try

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.520 
actually choose electric but if you try
to<00:03:33.209> use<00:03:33.450> it<00:03:33.480> at<00:03:33.780> a<00:03:33.810> time<00:03:34.049> where<00:03:34.290> it's<00:03:34.410> not

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
to use it at a time where it's not

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.649 
to use it at a time where it's not
practical<00:03:34.950> it<00:03:35.609> will<00:03:35.880> switch<00:03:36.150> automatically

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659 
practical it will switch automatically

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:38.780 
practical it will switch automatically
to<00:03:36.780> combustion<00:03:37.319> it<00:03:37.709> just<00:03:37.890> goes<00:03:38.010> beep<00:03:38.310> beep<00:03:38.340> and

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
to combustion it just goes beep beep and

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.940 
to combustion it just goes beep beep and
tells<00:03:39.000> you<00:03:39.120> it's<00:03:39.269> just<00:03:39.299> switched<00:03:39.690> again<00:03:39.950> so

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
tells you it's just switched again so

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:41.900 
tells you it's just switched again so
yeah<00:03:41.159> at<00:03:41.310> about<00:03:41.549> the

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
yeah at about the

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.300 
yeah at about the
from<00:03:42.150> 60<00:03:42.510> kilometers<00:03:42.930> in<00:03:43.020> a<00:03:43.110> hour<00:03:43.290> it<00:03:44.040> needs

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
from 60 kilometers in a hour it needs

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.920 
from 60 kilometers in a hour it needs
their<00:03:44.550> it<00:03:44.970> needs<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.270> combustion<00:03:45.600> engine

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
their it needs the combustion engine

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.980 
their it needs the combustion engine
that's<00:03:46.830> stopping<00:03:47.100> the<00:03:47.190> bed<00:03:47.340> tree<00:03:47.780> of<00:03:48.780> course

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
that's stopping the bed tree of course

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.120 
that's stopping the bed tree of course

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.630 
this in other countries as well it's
pretty<00:04:04.200> common<00:04:04.440> now<00:04:04.710> isn't<00:04:04.950> it<00:04:05.040> electronic

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
pretty common now isn't it electronic

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.230 
pretty common now isn't it electronic
toll<00:04:05.870> ting<00:04:06.870> ting<00:04:07.310> the<00:04:08.310> Japanese<00:04:08.760> one<00:04:08.940> tells

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
toll ting ting the Japanese one tells

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.700 
toll ting ting the Japanese one tells
you<00:04:09.390> how<00:04:09.510> much<00:04:09.660> the<00:04:09.840> toll<00:04:10.050> was<00:04:10.260> as<00:04:10.470> you<00:04:10.560> went

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:10.710

that<00:04:19.650> again<00:04:20.070> but<00:04:20.370> let's<00:04:20.520> get<00:04:20.670> to<00:04:20.730> the<00:04:20.910> good<00:04:21.090> bit

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
that again but let's get to the good bit

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.620 
that again but let's get to the good bit
this<00:04:21.450> is<00:04:21.570> my<00:04:21.690> favorite<00:04:22.170> bit<00:04:23.240> when<00:04:24.240> you<00:04:24.360> put<00:04:24.540> the

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
this is my favorite bit when you put the

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.430 
this is my favorite bit when you put the
car<00:04:24.840> in<00:04:25.050> reverse

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.810 

obviously<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.560> reversing<00:04:29.010> camera<00:04:29.340> comes<00:04:29.580> on

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
obviously the reversing camera comes on

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.580 
obviously the reversing camera comes on
and<00:04:30.270> it<00:04:30.390> gives<00:04:30.570> you<00:04:30.660> the<00:04:30.780> option<00:04:31.140> of<00:04:31.260> auto

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
and it gives you the option of auto

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.510 
and it gives you the option of auto
parking<00:04:32.300> so<00:04:33.300> you<00:04:33.360> can<00:04:33.840> choose<00:04:34.080> to<00:04:34.520> there's

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
parking so you can choose to there's

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.760 
parking so you can choose to there's
either<00:04:35.790> that<00:04:35.970> in<00:04:36.630> between<00:04:36.870> other<00:04:37.380> cars

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
either that in between other cars

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.540 
either that in between other cars
parking<00:04:38.340> or<00:04:38.580> the<00:04:39.290> parallel<00:04:40.290> parking<00:04:40.740> between

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
parking or the parallel parking between

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.120 
parking or the parallel parking between
two<00:04:41.700> cars<00:04:41.970> on<00:04:42.150> a<00:04:42.180> curb<00:04:42.560> so<00:04:43.560> you<00:04:43.650> can<00:04:43.770> see<00:04:43.950> which

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
two cars on a curb so you can see which

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.130 
two cars on a curb so you can see which
one<00:04:44.280> we're<00:04:44.430> using<00:04:44.460> here<00:04:44.880> and<00:04:45.390> to<00:04:45.750> be<00:04:45.840> honest

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
one we're using here and to be honest

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.050 
one we're using here and to be honest
guys<00:04:46.260> this<00:04:46.560> is<00:04:46.680> a<00:04:46.710> lot<00:04:46.980> of<00:04:47.100> jerking<00:04:47.460> around<00:04:47.580> I

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
guys this is a lot of jerking around I

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.990 
guys this is a lot of jerking around I
mean<00:04:48.360> it<00:04:48.630> would<00:04:48.810> have<00:04:48.930> taken<00:04:49.080> me<00:04:49.880> you<00:04:50.880> know

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
mean it would have taken me you know

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.330 
mean it would have taken me you know
five<00:04:51.420> seconds<00:04:51.990> to<00:04:52.200> reverse<00:04:52.530> into<00:04:52.890> the<00:04:52.920> spot

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
five seconds to reverse into the spot

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.030 
five seconds to reverse into the spot
myself<00:04:54.170> but<00:04:55.170> setting<00:04:55.560> this<00:04:55.680> thing<00:04:55.740> actually

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
myself but setting this thing actually

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.610 
myself but setting this thing actually
took<00:04:56.400> a<00:04:56.550> long<00:04:56.790> time<00:04:56.820> I<00:04:57.419> cut<00:04:57.780> it<00:04:57.960> I<00:04:58.140> cut<00:04:58.470> it

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
took a long time I cut it I cut it

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.260 
took a long time I cut it I cut it
because<00:04:58.710> we're<00:04:59.310> playing<00:04:59.610> with<00:04:59.880> it<00:05:00.000> for<00:05:00.150> ages

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
because we're playing with it for ages

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.240 
because we're playing with it for ages
to<00:05:00.600> try<00:05:00.780> and<00:05:00.900> set<00:05:01.080> it<00:05:01.200> you<00:05:01.740> have<00:05:01.860> to<00:05:01.980> actually

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
to try and set it you have to actually

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.090 
to try and set it you have to actually
show<00:05:02.280> the<00:05:02.700> car<00:05:03.020> where<00:05:04.020> you<00:05:04.110> want<00:05:04.290> to<00:05:04.350> go<00:05:04.500> so<00:05:05.040> you

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
show the car where you want to go so you

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.340 
show the car where you want to go so you
have<00:05:05.280> to<00:05:05.430> move<00:05:05.640> the<00:05:06.090> little<00:05:06.510> cursory<00:05:07.110> lines

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
have to move the little cursory lines

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.080 
have to move the little cursory lines
around<00:05:07.830> until<00:05:08.340> you<00:05:08.400> get<00:05:08.490> the<00:05:08.610> car<00:05:08.850> where<00:05:09.000> you

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
around until you get the car where you

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.070 
around until you get the car where you
want<00:05:09.270> it<00:05:09.330> to<00:05:09.450> be<00:05:11.120> first<00:05:12.120> so<00:05:12.480> it's<00:05:12.720> sort<00:05:12.960> of<00:05:12.990> not

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
want it to be first so it's sort of not

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.420 
want it to be first so it's sort of not
worth<00:05:13.290> it<00:05:13.470> unless<00:05:13.590> you're<00:05:13.830> really<00:05:14.190> unless

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
worth it unless you're really unless

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.920 
worth it unless you're really unless
you're<00:05:14.610> better<00:05:14.820> with<00:05:15.030> computers<00:05:15.600> than<00:05:15.810> you

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
you're better with computers than you

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.900 
you're better with computers than you
are<00:05:16.080> with<00:05:16.260> driving<00:05:16.740> a<00:05:16.919> car<00:05:17.220> if<00:05:17.490> you're<00:05:17.760> really

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
are with driving a car if you're really

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.300 
are with driving a car if you're really
hopeless<00:05:18.180> at<00:05:18.480> driving<00:05:18.690> a<00:05:18.900> car<00:05:19.169> then<00:05:19.830> probably

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
hopeless at driving a car then probably

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.970 
hopeless at driving a car then probably
this<00:05:20.490> is<00:05:20.669> worthwhile<00:05:21.290> but<00:05:22.290> other<00:05:22.710> than<00:05:22.919> that

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
this is worthwhile but other than that

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.830 
this is worthwhile but other than that
it's<00:05:23.400> probably<00:05:23.669> a<00:05:23.820> waste<00:05:23.940> of<00:05:24.120> time<00:05:24.300> so<00:05:24.600> anyway

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
it's probably a waste of time so anyway

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.600 
it's probably a waste of time so anyway
you<00:05:24.900> said<00:05:25.200> it<00:05:25.350> you<00:05:25.560> say<00:05:25.740> okay<00:05:26.010> I'm<00:05:26.280> happy<00:05:26.430> with

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
you said it you say okay I'm happy with

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.700 
you said it you say okay I'm happy with
that<00:05:26.669> steering<00:05:27.419> wheel<00:05:27.480> has<00:05:27.720> to<00:05:27.840> be<00:05:27.960> straight

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
that steering wheel has to be straight

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.040 
that steering wheel has to be straight
and<00:05:29.010> then<00:05:29.580> off<00:05:29.850> it<00:05:30.150> goes<00:05:30.180> you<00:05:30.660> still<00:05:30.930> do

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
and then off it goes you still do

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.600 
and then off it goes you still do
accelerator<00:05:31.470> and<00:05:31.650> brake<00:05:31.710> but<00:05:32.220> it<00:05:32.340> does<00:05:32.490> the

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
accelerator and brake but it does the

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:38.420 
accelerator and brake but it does the
steering<00:05:32.790> wheel<00:05:36.740> so<00:05:37.740> we're<00:05:37.890> reversing<00:05:38.130> back

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
steering wheel so we're reversing back

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.310 
steering wheel so we're reversing back
into<00:05:38.669> the<00:05:38.760> spot<00:05:39.060> you<00:05:39.570> can<00:05:39.690> see<00:05:39.930> there<00:05:40.169> we're

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
into the spot you can see there we're

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.200 
into the spot you can see there we're
reversing<00:05:40.770> back<00:05:41.010> it's<00:05:41.400> it's<00:05:41.760> moving<00:05:41.940> the

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
reversing back it's it's moving the

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.360 
reversing back it's it's moving the
steering<00:05:42.600> wheel<00:05:42.780> and<00:05:43.560> it<00:05:43.680> put<00:05:44.100> it<00:05:44.190> exactly

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
steering wheel and it put it exactly

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.000 
steering wheel and it put it exactly
where<00:05:44.790> it<00:05:45.720> put<00:05:45.900> it<00:05:45.990> exactly<00:05:46.169> where<00:05:46.530> we<00:05:46.620> told<00:05:46.860> it

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
where it put it exactly where we told it

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:52.370 
where it put it exactly where we told it
to<00:05:48.020> so<00:05:49.020> it<00:05:49.350> works<00:05:49.590> but<00:05:50.930> it's<00:05:51.930> just<00:05:52.050> a<00:05:52.169> lot<00:05:52.289> of

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
to so it works but it's just a lot of

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.020 
to so it works but it's just a lot of
jerking<00:05:52.590> around<00:05:52.830> it's<00:05:53.520> just<00:05:53.610> a<00:05:53.760> lot<00:05:53.910> of

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
jerking around it's just a lot of

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.149 
jerking around it's just a lot of
setting<00:05:54.419> it<00:05:54.510> to

00:05:55.149 --> 00:05:55.159 
setting it to

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:56.589 
setting it to
it's<00:05:55.429> a<00:05:55.489> bit<00:05:55.639> of<00:05:55.729> a<00:05:55.789> pain<00:05:55.999> so<00:05:56.059> I<00:05:56.330> don't<00:05:56.479> think

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:56.599 
it's a bit of a pain so I don't think

00:05:56.599 --> 00:05:57.850 
it's a bit of a pain so I don't think
it's<00:05:56.719> really<00:05:56.929> worth<00:05:57.110> it<00:05:57.319> but<00:05:57.439> anyway<00:05:57.709> unless

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
it's really worth it but anyway unless

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.290 
it's really worth it but anyway unless
you're<00:05:58.069> really<00:05:58.219> bad<00:05:58.399> car<00:05:58.639> park<00:05:58.849> well<00:05:59.089> here's

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 
you're really bad car park well here's

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.059 
you're really bad car park well here's
the<00:06:00.309> the<00:06:01.309> end<00:06:01.489> result<00:06:01.879> of<00:06:02.059> our<00:06:02.559> 561<00:06:03.559> kilometers

00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:04.069 
the the end result of our 561 kilometers

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:06.579 
the the end result of our 561 kilometers
it<00:06:04.399> averaged<00:06:04.729> twenty<00:06:05.330> point<00:06:05.599> five<00:06:05.869> kilometres

00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:06.589 
it averaged twenty point five kilometres

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:12.429
