found<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.210> if<00:01:39.390> you've<00:01:39.509> got<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.689> pot<00:01:39.900> of

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
found that if you've got a pot of

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.120 
found that if you've got a pot of
yoghurt<00:01:40.259> sitting<00:01:40.470> in<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.619> fridge<00:01:40.770> going<00:01:41.070> a

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
little bit off soda bread is a perfect

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.499 
little bit off soda bread is a perfect
place<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.110> smuggle<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.680> so<00:01:44.670> now<00:01:44.820> I've<00:01:44.909> got<00:01:45.030> 300

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
place to smuggle it so now I've got 300

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.090 
place to smuggle it so now I've got 300
grams<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.840> self-raising<00:01:46.079> flour<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.829> it's<00:01:46.950> hid

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
grams of self-raising flour and it's hid

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.710 
grams of self-raising flour and it's hid
in<00:01:47.250> it

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
in it

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.810 
in it
but<00:01:48.720> just<00:01:49.049> like<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.439> add<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:50.250> rounded

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
but just like that add a rounded

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.969 
but just like that add a rounded
teaspoon<00:01:51.030> by<00:01:51.600> cog<00:01:51.869> when<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.560> reacts<00:01:52.860> with

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
teaspoon by cog when that reacts with

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.499 
teaspoon by cog when that reacts with
the<00:01:53.100> lemon<00:01:53.430> juice<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.790> milk<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.210> makes

the lemon juice and the milk and makes

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.999 
the lemon juice and the milk and makes
your<00:01:54.659> bread<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.869> go<00:01:54.990> from<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.229> dough<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.979> a

braid take your rhubarb think you've got

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.719 
braid take your rhubarb think you've got
a<00:01:58.409> bit<00:01:58.530> too<00:01:58.619> much<00:01:58.860> here<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.280> I'm<00:01:59.399> going<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.549> tip

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
a bit too much here so I'm going to tip

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.770 
a bit too much here so I'm going to tip
that<00:01:59.909> look<00:02:00.090> in<00:02:00.240> give<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.320> mix<00:02:01.469> through

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
that look in give it a mix through

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.230 
that look in give it a mix through
and<00:02:03.410> just<00:02:04.010> going<00:02:04.100> to<00:02:04.160> add<00:02:04.340> some<00:02:04.610> ginger<00:02:04.790> to

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
and just going to add some ginger to

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.980 
and just going to add some ginger to
that<00:02:05.390> as<00:02:05.540> well

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
that as well

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.219 
that as well
I've<00:02:06.740> lost<00:02:07.010> my<00:02:07.250> grater<00:02:07.490> so<00:02:08.210> instead<00:02:08.690> on<00:02:08.899> just

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
I've lost my grater so instead on just

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.719 
I've lost my grater so instead on just
scraping<00:02:09.530> this<00:02:09.800> ginger<00:02:10.070> with<00:02:10.190> a<00:02:10.250> teaspoon

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
scraping this ginger with a teaspoon

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.130 
scraping this ginger with a teaspoon
which<00:02:10.940> is<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.180> easiest<00:02:11.420> way<00:02:11.540> to<00:02:11.570> peel<00:02:11.810> it<00:02:11.870> it's

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
which is the easiest way to peel it it's

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.320 
which is the easiest way to peel it it's
got<00:02:12.230> extremely<00:02:12.800> thin<00:02:13.130> skin<00:02:13.490> so<00:02:13.700> you<00:02:13.850> can<00:02:13.940> just

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
got extremely thin skin so you can just

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.080 
got extremely thin skin so you can just
scrape<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.350> skin<00:02:15.530> off<00:02:15.680> it<00:02:15.920> when<00:02:16.790> you<00:02:16.910> also

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
scrape the skin off it when you also

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.940 
scrape the skin off it when you also
don't<00:02:17.390> lose<00:02:17.720> too<00:02:17.990> much<00:02:18.140> of<00:02:18.320> that<00:02:18.410> ginger<00:02:18.650> there

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
don't lose too much of that ginger there

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.920 
don't lose too much of that ginger there
because<00:02:19.490> it<00:02:19.640> literally<00:02:19.940> only<00:02:20.270> takes<00:02:20.420> off<00:02:20.780> the

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
because it literally only takes off the

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.800 
because it literally only takes off the
skin<00:02:21.250> so<00:02:22.250> I<00:02:22.520> use<00:02:23.030> that<00:02:23.060> method<00:02:23.480> I'm<00:02:23.600> going<00:02:23.750> to

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
skin so I use that method I'm going to

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.130 
skin so I use that method I'm going to
get<00:02:23.900> it<00:02:23.990> in<00:02:24.080> nice<00:02:24.290> thin<00:02:24.860> strips<00:02:25.780> so<00:02:26.780> mix<00:02:27.080> that

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
get it in nice thin strips so mix that

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.810 
get it in nice thin strips so mix that
through<00:02:27.410> as<00:02:27.500> well<00:02:27.680> using<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.459> world's

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
through as well using the world's

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.420 
through as well using the world's
smallest<00:02:29.180> spoon<00:02:29.780> to<00:02:30.740> mix<00:02:30.830> all<00:02:31.070> this<00:02:31.190> through

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
smallest spoon to mix all this through

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.930 
smallest spoon to mix all this through
and<00:02:32.270> make<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.170> well<00:02:33.500> in<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:33.740> center<00:02:34.160> of<00:02:34.220> it<00:02:34.400> add

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
and make a well in the center of it add

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.060 
and make a well in the center of it add
a<00:02:35.360> little<00:02:35.450> bit<00:02:35.840> of<00:02:35.870> this<00:02:36.050> nicely<00:02:36.380> curdled<00:02:36.950> milk

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
a little bit of this nicely curdled milk

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.500 
a little bit of this nicely curdled milk
here<00:02:37.430> so<00:02:37.940> I'm<00:02:38.030> going<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:38.180> add<00:02:38.300> most<00:02:38.540> of<00:02:38.780> that

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
here so I'm going to add most of that

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.870 
here so I'm going to add most of that
mix<00:02:41.510> it<00:02:41.690> up<00:02:41.810> so<00:02:42.500> add<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:42.830> liquid<00:02:43.340> gradually

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
mix it up so add the liquid gradually

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.790 
mix it up so add the liquid gradually

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
come together but if it goes a bit too

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.949 
come together but if it goes a bit too
dry<00:02:55.940> you<00:02:55.970> can<00:02:56.180> add<00:02:56.330> a<00:02:56.390> little<00:02:56.630> bit<00:02:56.750> of<00:02:56.810> the

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
dry you can add a little bit of the
