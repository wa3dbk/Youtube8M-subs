only<00:07:07.940> modification<00:07:08.450> that<00:07:09.020> i<00:07:09.080> would<00:07:09.320> do<00:07:09.470> is

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:09.650 
only modification that i would do is

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.050 
only modification that i would do is
probably<00:07:10.130> my<00:07:10.580> feet<00:07:10.820> were<00:07:11.030> just<00:07:11.270> a<00:07:11.450> little<00:07:11.960> bit

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:13.060 
probably my feet were just a little bit

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.420 
probably my feet were just a little bit
enclosed<00:07:14.060> and<00:07:14.480> I<00:07:14.840> like<00:07:15.590> a<00:07:15.620> little<00:07:15.920> more<00:07:16.220> room

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:16.430 
enclosed and I like a little more room

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.060 
enclosed and I like a little more room
in<00:07:16.670> the<00:07:16.760> back<00:07:16.940> end<00:07:17.300> so<00:07:18.170> probably<00:07:18.560> just<00:07:18.800> trying

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:19.070 
in the back end so probably just trying

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:20.650 
in the back end so probably just trying
to<00:07:19.130> figure<00:07:19.280> out<00:07:19.400> how<00:07:19.640> to<00:07:19.700> make<00:07:19.910> the<00:07:20.120> back<00:07:20.300> end<00:07:20.570> a

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:20.660 
to figure out how to make the back end a

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:33.260 
to figure out how to make the back end a
little<00:07:20.810> little<00:07:21.530> bit<00:07:21.680> higher<00:07:21.950> and<00:07:22.370> wider

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:33.270 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.330
