00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
cameras you know the cameras that were

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.150 
cameras you know the cameras that were
intended<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:40.110> be<00:00:40.260> put<00:00:40.440> into<00:00:40.620> call<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:40.950> duty

black<00:00:41.219> ops<00:00:41.489> 2<00:00:41.700> but<00:00:41.879> never<00:00:42.090> work<00:00:42.300> or<00:00:42.510> maybe

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
black ops 2 but never work or maybe

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.720 
black ops 2 but never work or maybe
there's<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.559> slight<00:00:43.890> chance<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.309> these<00:00:44.520> are

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
there's a slight chance that these are

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.029 
there's a slight chance that these are
future<00:00:45.120> camos<00:00:45.480> but<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.260> really<00:00:46.590> doubt<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.770> you

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
future camos but I really doubt that you

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:47.990 
future camos but I really doubt that you
know<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.160> don't<00:00:47.370> think<00:00:47.610> they're<00:00:47.760> going<00:00:47.940> to

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
know I don't think they're going to

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.310 
know I don't think they're going to
bring<00:00:48.120> any<00:00:48.360> more<00:00:48.510> cameras<00:00:48.930> we're<00:00:49.079> going<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.260> be

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
bring any more cameras we're going to be

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.319 
bring any more cameras we're going to be
having<00:00:49.410> two<00:00:49.680> more<00:00:49.890> cameras<00:00:50.250> if<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:50.910> bet<00:00:51.030> we've

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
having two more cameras if I bet we've

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.119 
having two more cameras if I bet we've
had<00:00:51.420> about<00:00:51.539> four<00:00:51.870> or<00:00:51.899> five<00:00:52.050> new<00:00:52.440> ones<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:52.920> I

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
had about four or five new ones so I

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.830 
had about four or five new ones so I
don't<00:00:53.520> think<00:00:53.699> these<00:00:53.879> are<00:00:54.090> new<00:00:54.210> ones<00:00:54.420> coming<00:00:54.660> in

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
don't think these are new ones coming in

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.569 
don't think these are new ones coming in
although<00:00:55.530> there<00:00:55.739> could<00:00:55.920> be<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.219> slight

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
although there could be the slight

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.459 
although there could be the slight
chance<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.360> Arbat<00:00:57.690> i'm<00:00:58.050> going<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.320> say

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
chance that the Arbat i'm going to say

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.080 
chance that the Arbat i'm going to say
these<00:00:58.680> are<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.920> Forgotten<00:00:59.070> or<00:00:59.460> hidden<00:00:59.670> camos

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090

going<00:01:28.920> every<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.340> often<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.939> will<00:01:30.060> go<00:01:30.180> from

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
going every so often so it will go from

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.120

you know pink to yellow from yellow to
purple<00:01:32.430> it'll<00:01:33.180> keep<00:01:33.360> changing<00:01:33.840> color<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.259> why

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
purple it'll keep changing color and why

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.899 
purple it'll keep changing color and why
they<00:01:34.530> haven't<00:01:34.680> put<00:01:34.829> these<00:01:35.009> camos<00:01:35.400> into<00:01:35.729> black

really ashamed or you know I'm just not
very<00:02:04.259> happy<00:02:04.829> that<00:02:04.950> they<00:02:05.040> didn't<00:02:05.250> actually<00:02:05.399> put

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
very happy that they didn't actually put

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.459 
very happy that they didn't actually put
these<00:02:05.850> into<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.240> game<00:02:06.420> because<00:02:06.719> actually<00:02:07.320> I

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
these into the game because actually I

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.260 
these into the game because actually I
think<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:08.099> most<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.429> these<00:02:08.550> cameos<00:02:08.849> if<00:02:09.090> not

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
think that most of these cameos if not

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.790 
think that most of these cameos if not
all<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.390> them<00:02:09.629> are<00:02:09.750> better<00:02:10.349> than<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.770> ones

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
all of them are better than the ones

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.260 
all of them are better than the ones
that<00:02:11.129> we've<00:02:11.250> got<00:02:11.370> in<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.610> game<00:02:11.760> now<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.030> know

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
that we've got in the game now you know

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.820 
that we've got in the game now you know
I<00:02:12.300> don't<00:02:12.480> know

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
I don't know

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.200 
I don't know
I didn't<00:02:13.100> choose<00:02:13.280> to<00:02:13.460> put<00:02:13.610> these<00:02:13.820> cameras

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
I didn't choose to put these cameras

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.970 
I didn't choose to put these cameras
into<00:02:14.870> black<00:02:15.080> ops<00:02:15.290> 2<00:02:15.470> maybe<00:02:15.740> they<00:02:15.890> were

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
into black ops 2 maybe they were

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.770 
into black ops 2 maybe they were
intending<00:02:16.490> to<00:02:16.580> actually<00:02:16.850> make<00:02:17.000> them<00:02:17.120> into<00:02:17.390> DLC

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
intending to actually make them into DLC

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.420 
intending to actually make them into DLC
in<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:17.960> future<00:02:18.320> but<00:02:18.770> they<00:02:18.920> haven't<00:02:19.100> you<00:02:19.310> know

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
in the future but they haven't you know

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.070 
in the future but they haven't you know
they've<00:02:19.640> just<00:02:19.820> left<00:02:19.970> them<00:02:20.180> in<00:02:20.240> the<00:02:20.360> game<00:02:20.540> they

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
they've just left them in the game they

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.570 
they've just left them in the game they
made<00:02:21.290> them<00:02:21.530> all<00:02:21.680> they<00:02:22.010> just<00:02:22.190> haven't<00:02:22.460> bothered

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
made them all they just haven't bothered

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.920 
made them all they just haven't bothered
putting<00:02:22.820> them<00:02:23.030> in<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.210> game<00:02:23.390> so<00:02:23.600> I<00:02:23.630> think

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
putting them in the game so I think

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.600 
putting them in the game so I think
they're<00:02:24.050> all<00:02:24.170> really<00:02:24.470> awesome<00:02:25.040> colors<00:02:25.430> so

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610
