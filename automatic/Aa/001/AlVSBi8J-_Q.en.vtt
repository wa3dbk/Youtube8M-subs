product<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:03.150> only<00:03:03.390> thing<00:03:03.660> I<00:03:03.840> did<00:03:04.019> not<00:03:04.170> like

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
product the only thing I did not like

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.259 
product the only thing I did not like
about<00:03:04.440> this<00:03:04.830> product<00:03:05.130> is<00:03:05.430> it<00:03:05.640> actually<00:03:06.060> broke

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
about this product is it actually broke

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.880 
about this product is it actually broke
me<00:03:06.510> out<00:03:06.660> and<00:03:07.019> I<00:03:07.049> don't<00:03:07.110> really<00:03:07.380> know<00:03:07.620> if<00:03:07.739> it's

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
me out and I don't really know if it's

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.319 
me out and I don't really know if it's
from<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.190> product<00:03:08.579> but<00:03:08.730> I<00:03:08.760> think<00:03:09.030> it<00:03:09.150> is

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
from the product but I think it is

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.090 
from the product but I think it is
because<00:03:09.780> I've<00:03:10.019> been<00:03:10.170> using<00:03:10.350> this<00:03:10.650> for<00:03:10.920> like<00:03:11.070> a

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
because I've been using this for like a

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.160 
because I've been using this for like a
month<00:03:11.400> already<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:12.239> I've<00:03:12.690> had<00:03:12.930> like

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
month already and I've had like

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.410 
month already and I've had like
breakouts<00:03:13.739> here<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.220> there<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.700> I<00:03:15.090> haven't

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
breakouts here and there and I haven't

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.470 
breakouts here and there and I haven't
had<00:03:15.660> as<00:03:15.930> many<00:03:16.079> breakouts<00:03:16.590> as<00:03:16.980> I<00:03:17.820> did<00:03:18.180> when<00:03:18.450> I

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
had as many breakouts as I did when I

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.630 
had as many breakouts as I did when I
was<00:03:18.660> using<00:03:18.870> this<00:03:19.140> product<00:03:19.470> so<00:03:19.829> I<00:03:19.860> really<00:03:20.430> do

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
was using this product so I really do

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.000 
was using this product so I really do
think<00:03:20.940> that<00:03:21.060> this<00:03:21.450> is<00:03:21.720> from<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.049> product<00:03:22.500> I<00:03:22.709> do

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
think that this is from the product I do

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.370 
think that this is from the product I do
have<00:03:23.340> sensitive<00:03:23.640> skin<00:03:23.970> so<00:03:24.720> if<00:03:24.959> you<00:03:25.079> do<00:03:25.230> have

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
have sensitive skin so if you do have

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.039 
have sensitive skin so if you do have
sensitive<00:03:25.620> skin<00:03:26.190> I<00:03:26.310> don't<00:03:26.430> know<00:03:26.780> if<00:03:27.780> I<00:03:27.900> would

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
sensitive skin I don't know if I would

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:29.479 
sensitive skin I don't know if I would
really<00:03:28.079> recommend<00:03:28.440> this<00:03:28.920> for<00:03:29.160> you

use this because I want to see if it
actually<00:04:01.299> just<00:04:01.780> like<00:04:02.260> the<00:04:02.470> initial<00:04:02.950> fees<00:04:03.190> if

it's just trying to get rid of all the

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.729 
it's just trying to get rid of all the
like<00:04:06.640> the<00:04:06.819> dirt<00:04:07.000> off<00:04:07.180> my<00:04:07.209> face<00:04:07.690> that's<00:04:08.140> why<00:04:08.440> I'm

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
like the dirt off my face that's why I'm

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.920 
like the dirt off my face that's why I'm
breaking<00:04:09.040> out<00:04:09.400> but<00:04:09.760> if<00:04:10.090> it's<00:04:10.329> still<00:04:10.599> breaking

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
breaking out but if it's still breaking

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.600 
breaking out but if it's still breaking
me<00:04:11.049> out<00:04:11.079> then<00:04:11.500> I'm<00:04:11.709> definitely<00:04:11.980> gonna<00:04:12.310> stop

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
me out then I'm definitely gonna stop

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.729 
me out then I'm definitely gonna stop
using<00:04:12.940> this<00:04:13.299> I<00:04:13.510> find<00:04:13.959> it<00:04:14.079> is<00:04:14.200> good<00:04:14.500> for

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
using this I find it is good for

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:16.650 
using this I find it is good for
exfoliating<00:04:15.579> your<00:04:15.700> face<00:04:15.940> really<00:04:16.180> makes<00:04:16.510> your

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
exfoliating your face really makes your

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.439 
exfoliating your face really makes your
face<00:04:16.840> quite<00:04:17.109> soft<00:04:17.470> and<00:04:17.739> more<00:04:18.340> younger<00:04:18.850> looking

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:19.449 
face quite soft and more younger looking

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:21.240 
face quite soft and more younger looking
I<00:04:19.570> guess<00:04:19.600> since<00:04:19.989> it<00:04:20.199> does<00:04:20.380> buff<00:04:20.769> out<00:04:20.919> all<00:04:21.100> the

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
I guess since it does buff out all the

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.760 
I guess since it does buff out all the
dull<00:04:21.459> and<00:04:21.489> dead<00:04:21.760> skin<00:04:22.110> but<00:04:23.110> if<00:04:23.350> you<00:04:23.470> do<00:04:23.590> have

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
dull and dead skin but if you do have

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.469 
dull and dead skin but if you do have
sensitive<00:04:24.310> skin<00:04:24.340> I'm<00:04:24.699> not<00:04:24.729> too<00:04:25.000> sure<00:04:25.150> if<00:04:25.180> this

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
sensitive skin I'm not too sure if this

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:27.120 
sensitive skin I'm not too sure if this
is<00:04:25.600> a<00:04:25.630> product<00:04:25.900> I<00:04:26.110> would<00:04:26.169> recommend<00:04:26.770> for<00:04:26.979> you

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
is a product I would recommend for you

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.939 
is a product I would recommend for you
because<00:04:27.310> it<00:04:27.550> did<00:04:27.729> break<00:04:27.940> me<00:04:28.180> out<00:04:28.210> so<00:04:28.720> I<00:04:29.050> don't

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:29.949 
because it did break me out so I don't

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:31.650 
because it did break me out so I don't
really<00:04:30.130> have<00:04:30.340> much<00:04:30.580> to<00:04:30.760> say<00:04:30.970> on<00:04:31.000> this<00:04:31.240> product
