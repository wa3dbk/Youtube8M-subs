 liters per hour of models 550 and 66 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.360
 37 and 58 6 38 some rules of use and 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.519

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.009
 of swimming pools please consult the 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:22.140
 menu filtration box section

 of operation after installing the 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.779
 bomb 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.130
 If your pool has a system 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.750
 interested guard see the video 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.489

 insert the filter grid inside the 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.580
 lower connector building and the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.160
 input jet device to the 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.620
 Pool in the upper collector hole 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.390
 from the outside of the pool connect 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.760
 the hose of the sewage pump at 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.800
 superior black connector and to the collection 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.630
 bottom of the pump use the 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.370
 hose clamps provided and 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.590
 place them directly on the 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.900
 black washers on the connectors on the 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.880
 pump then connect the second hose 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.760
 to the bottom collector of the pool and to the 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.350
 upper connector of the pump use a 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.060
 currency to ensure that all 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.530
 The hoses' races are fine 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.510
 placed 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.720
 Now check that the cartridge 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:21.330
 filter is well placed replace with 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.090
 care the filter cover the seal 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.369
 and the upper deck the cover only 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.080
 must be adjusted by hand check 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.500
 also that the air exhaust valve 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.080
 The treatment plant is already closed 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.619
 is ready now you just have to fill 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.619
 the pool 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.410
 before filling the pool with water 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.510
 make sure the drain plug 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.480
 is tightly closed and the outer cap 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:52.180
 firmly subject extend the part well 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.540
 bottom of the pool check for 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:59.170
 new that the pool is level now 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.680
 you can start filling it 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.850
 start with three centimeters of water 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.830
 check that the water extends from 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.990
 uniform way 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.420
 then smooth carefully the wrinkles of the 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.680
 bottom and pull the edges as you 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.680
 Indicates in the image 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.600
 continue filling the pool 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.490
 the water level should be so 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.840
 minus three centimeters above the 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.879
 top connector 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.620
 the pool is too full the water 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:33.020
 it could spill causing damage 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.050
 materials or personal 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:40.450
 if this happens reduce the water level 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.450
 and check that the pool is level 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.950
 When the pool is full open the 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.319
 air exhaust valve part 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.660
 top of the filter frame when 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:54.440
 up the water close the valve with the 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.060
 hand the pump is ready and follow the 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.349
 following safety instructions 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.349
 when I handle the pump 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.620
 it is important that you follow these 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.530
 recommendations when handling the 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.120
 purifier never turn on the pump until 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.590
 that the pool is not completely 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.540
 full 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.350
 do not operate the pump when there is 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.990
 people in the water 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.770
 use only one type current output

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.450
 the filter cartridge will continue to clean 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:28.430
 effectively about two weeks when 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.160
 spend that time you may have to 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.170
 replace 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:36.250
 You can clean it with a hose 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.880
 garden or replace it with a cartridge 59
