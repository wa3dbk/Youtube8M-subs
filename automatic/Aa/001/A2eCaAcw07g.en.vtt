this<00:02:32.260> or<00:02:32.620> else<00:02:33.069> this<00:02:34.000> one<00:02:34.269> connect<00:02:34.810> on<00:02:35.340> this

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
this or else this one connect on this

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:43.160 
this or else this one connect on this
one<00:02:36.630> this<00:02:37.630> one<00:02:38.349> connect<00:02:39.090> not<00:02:40.090> like<00:02:40.300> this

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.590 

because<00:02:44.170> if<00:02:44.560> it's<00:02:44.830> like<00:02:44.920> that<00:02:45.040> then<00:02:45.280> this<00:02:46.239> will

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
because if it's like that then this will

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.280 
because if it's like that then this will
not<00:02:46.630> fit<00:02:47.200> you<00:02:47.440> know<00:02:48.060> so<00:02:49.060> it<00:02:49.390> has<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:49.750> be<00:02:49.900> this

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
not fit you know so it has to be this

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:58.559 
not fit you know so it has to be this
way<00:02:52.260> like<00:02:53.260> that<00:02:54.330> see<00:02:55.330> and<00:02:56.400> then<00:02:57.400> last<00:02:58.239> but<00:02:58.420> not

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
way like that see and then last but not

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.210 
way like that see and then last but not
