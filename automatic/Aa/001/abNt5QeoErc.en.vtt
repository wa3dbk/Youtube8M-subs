00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:10.650
 so the symptoms as it was in my case 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.840
 you go you go this way you go and 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.660
 Suddenly the car certainly has no heads 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.449
 generally abruptly and the car starts abruptly 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.130
 slow down due to the fact that it stalled in 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.850
 Generally in this situation it is necessary from 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.850
 collar 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.090
 and to the curb so well 100 times no one 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:32.130
 hurt look mirrors 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:33.780
 Now I am standing on the side of the road and well, 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.570
 here, respectively , her hand choke 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:41.550
 it is desirable that you have my hand 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.440
 clear so everything is fine because 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.450
 what am I when you take it off 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.140
 rags start him constantly would 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.820
 hold the brake pedal while 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.120
 bath address gas slightly wield 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.579
 it is sometimes desirable that your nickname be a bow 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:01.050
 in warehouses, you can without handbrake batik 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:04.739
 here is our car heads not yes you have become 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.920
 on ordinary and you are such think of something on 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.189
 oak stalled such and such shorter times 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:18.180
 such attacks are types of type yes caricature 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:21.390
 disconnected on connected and in theory there 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.570
 Type this reveal turns off start food 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:28.380
 factory but so attached is painted a little bit 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.110
 clicked so on 1 and small type but she 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.600
 shorter start up and the same stalls and 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.869
 are you not understand something on each 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.150
 such stalls are shorter and such 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.880
 êàî study and the short turn on again 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.979
 buttons further such obse shares and again 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.790
 shorter factory and it is a miracle coffee again 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:52.049
 started up and stalled and by a couple of times 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.630
 did yes and then I am again yes at the factory 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.329
 tekke office and she is shorter at all not even 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.700
 does not try to start in the future 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.950
 have she very much not trying to depend so much 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:07.950
 that's how I actually got out of this 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:09.840
 the situation could be due to a 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.700
 then the air may be in gasoline got 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.270
 some kind of dirt from the gas tank because 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.400
 the car 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:18.300
 18 years old there is clearer and hero to find out what's there 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.850
 without a dog there is a hose 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.330
 Benza hose that goes to the operator 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.700
 perhaps he is already a little under 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.420
 obsolete there tires crumble a little 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.220
 somewhere some threads might fly out and 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.780
 this dirt may also fall into 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.400
 my carburetor carburetor machines 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:42.120
 You know that whimsical speed 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.390
 thing any dirt there it is veto guard for 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.740
 the carb then death 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.510
 that and and but I don't mean maybe 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.520
 some kind of vodka they know what it is 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.350
 maybe dick knows water maybe 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:58.470
 wine for a barrel file there can be without 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:01.500
 under the seat of instructions some i 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.690
 read it there need to have a seat report with it and 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.640
 look at some terminals PM 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.920
 gas tank clean that is unscrew 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.070
 a piece because 18 years old car there 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.320
 everything is already all oxidized and possible without 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.590
 we are already somewhere just well, not always 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.120
 grasps clear plan now i'll open 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.620
 Comp glasses will show how I actually 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:27.959
 left the situation and then look 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:32.040
 here it is now see this benzofilter 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:37.049
 how he is like little gasoline in a bin means 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:40.440
 This is the carburetor , and here it is 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:43.709
 manual fuel injection witte to valve 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.030
 nice down then press that means if 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.420
 you have a car stalled and do not start 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:53.629
 I must try the next one. 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.629
 on this crap pump fuel 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.960
 pretty before gasoline goes away it means show 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.240
 went to the check goes up here but he 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.260
 can flow back from the hose 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.510
 lead back there 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.940
 so you need to pump so far 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:13.310
 pump over pump over 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:20.290
 pump fuel up to 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:20.290
 turn ignition on 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:30.720
 maybe somewhere slates crappy 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:34.410
 move the hose a little bit 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:37.580
 here knock here and pump over 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.580
 so very simple than 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.940
 so but in principle everything is fine with me 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:58.610
 she got a and so I may 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.080
 further simply will not swing because 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.940
 that I have a float chamber there already 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:08.380
 the whole here is the whole gasoline and so me 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.380
 maybe he will not swing on 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:16.910
 and here is actually such a pumping 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:22.230
 we have gasoline in the carburetor on dick and what they 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:24.270
 after that we start like this 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.190
 way i'm under the hood of this manual horseradish 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.800
 hrenaten and now this long shook 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.230
 shook that is pumped gasoline into this 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.710
 carburetor 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:37.400
 so a little torus bore down and shorter 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.400
 handcuffs removed 

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:50.389
 Well, as you can see , I have a reason and 

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:51.199
 she then started up successfully but 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:55.009
 me before 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:56.959
 before that one more such case I once 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:59.149
 so, too, rode-rode and and I have shorter . 

00:05:56.959 --> 00:06:01.159
 so firaxis stalled and so did i 

00:05:59.149 --> 00:06:02.830
 turned the plant on me 2 raised lips 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:04.550
 and then stopped stopping altogether and 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:09.229
 me shorter 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:11.929
 familiar to the track I had dragged 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:14.479
 but turned on the ignition and gear to i 

00:06:11.929 --> 00:06:15.339
 turned on there in my second floor to 2 

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:19.119
 pass in a bunch 

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:21.439
 squeezed the clutch turned on the ignition 

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:25.339
 Be sure to turn on the ignition 

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:27.249
 it so that the node does not block us when 

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:30.379
 turnaround 

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:33.529
 Well, we went shorter went to that is, he 

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:34.879
 I was dragged and I let go of the pedal 

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:37.159
 that is , my program was live 

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:39.919
 yuppie included yes . I let go of the number 

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:44.509
 some time well , yes went to the track 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:47.689
 then it started up shorter and that's shorter 

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:50.179
 it was cool that she was angry then I 

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:53.419
 I prayed to Allah I do not know to all the saints to 

00:06:50.179 --> 00:06:56.029
 nights prayed for me to get angry 

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:58.459
 when the car starts up now 

00:06:56.029 --> 00:07:02.400
 possible and this is the case van as you 

00:06:58.459 --> 00:07:05.280
 will help as its once in something 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:08.880
 if you have a car that also does not start 

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:11.400
 and stalls the kitchen and does not start happens 

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:14.479
 it is necessary at night I don't know maybe 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:16.889
 This gasoline pump already cover sometimes 

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:20.870
 there may be a contact somewhere crappy then 

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:23.250
 There are generally reasons there may be a mass and 

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.970
 that's the way these things can go 

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:25.970
 situations
