00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
family's pretty wealthy so they have a

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.830 
family's pretty wealthy so they have a
pretty<00:01:39.580> nice<00:01:39.729> house<00:01:39.909> and<00:01:40.150> just<00:01:40.270> it'd<00:01:40.690> be<00:01:40.810> a

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
pretty nice house and just it'd be a

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.109 
pretty nice house and just it'd be a
cool<00:01:41.020> thing<00:01:41.229> to<00:01:41.260> do<00:01:41.700> problem<00:01:42.700> is<00:01:42.790> that<00:01:43.000> she

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
cool thing to do problem is that she

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:44.550 
cool thing to do problem is that she
lives<00:01:43.330> up<00:01:43.420> in<00:01:43.450> the<00:01:43.600> gated<00:01:43.810> communities<00:01:44.320> up<00:01:44.470> in

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
lives up in the gated communities up in

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.649 
lives up in the gated communities up in
the<00:01:44.650> hills<00:01:44.920> so<00:01:45.640> to<00:01:45.729> get<00:01:45.970> to<00:01:46.030> her<00:01:46.180> house<00:01:46.360> is

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
the hills so to get to her house is

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.719 
the hills so to get to her house is
pretty<00:01:47.049> difficult<00:01:47.440> if<00:01:47.890> you<00:01:48.010> go<00:01:48.190> by<00:01:48.369> streets

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
pretty difficult if you go by streets

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.609 
pretty difficult if you go by streets
cuz<00:01:48.939> it's<00:01:49.270> probably<00:01:49.600> honestly<00:01:49.840> like<00:01:50.260> a<00:01:50.290> three

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
cuz it's probably honestly like a three

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.620 
cuz it's probably honestly like a three
and<00:01:50.680> a<00:01:50.740> half<00:01:50.799> hour<00:01:51.130> bike<00:01:51.610> ride<00:01:51.850> and<00:01:52.180> you'd<00:01:52.510> have

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
and a half hour bike ride and you'd have

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.810 
and a half hour bike ride and you'd have
to<00:01:52.750> hop<00:01:52.900> the<00:01:52.930> gates<00:01:53.290> and<00:01:53.439> everything<00:01:53.560> so<00:01:54.400> we

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
to hop the gates and everything so we

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.520 
to hop the gates and everything so we
decided<00:01:55.150> to<00:01:55.360> take<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:55.900> canyon<00:01:56.290> which<00:01:56.380> would

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
decided to take the canyon which would

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.109 
decided to take the canyon which would
be<00:01:56.619> about<00:01:56.710> 30<00:01:57.100> minutes<00:01:57.400> and<00:01:57.520> avoid<00:01:57.790> all<00:01:57.970> the

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
be about 30 minutes and avoid all the

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.450 
be about 30 minutes and avoid all the
gates<00:01:58.390> and<00:01:58.540> everything<00:01:58.630> so<00:01:59.560> the<00:01:59.799> canyon<00:02:00.189> is

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
gates and everything so the canyon is

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.710 
gates and everything so the canyon is
just<00:02:00.729> something<00:02:00.880> that<00:02:01.000> goes<00:02:01.180> through<00:02:01.450> a<00:02:01.479> city

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720
