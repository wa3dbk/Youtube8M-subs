00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
ancients it looked like the wing of a

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.860 
ancients it looked like the wing of a
bird<00:02:14.470> was<00:02:15.040> growing<00:02:15.400> over<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:15.880> side<00:02:16.180> usually

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
bird was growing over the side usually

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.360 
bird was growing over the side usually
from<00:02:17.019> the<00:02:17.080> side<00:02:17.319> of<00:02:17.349> the<00:02:17.470> nose<00:02:17.709> over<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.310> eye

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
from the side of the nose over the eye

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.569 
from the side of the nose over the eye
having<00:02:19.360> to<00:02:19.540> do<00:02:19.720> with<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.769> tissue<00:02:21.040> breaking

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579 
having to do with the tissue breaking

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:24.780 
having to do with the tissue breaking
down<00:02:21.760> due<00:02:22.060> to<00:02:22.090> sun<00:02:23.079> exposure<00:02:23.110> and<00:02:23.890> then<00:02:24.459> scar

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
down due to sun exposure and then scar

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.309 
down due to sun exposure and then scar
tissue<00:02:25.060> growing<00:02:25.420> in<00:02:25.690> its<00:02:25.840> place<00:02:26.049> and<00:02:26.260> the

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
tissue growing in its place and the

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:27.630 
tissue growing in its place and the
reason<00:02:26.560> it<00:02:26.680> tends<00:02:26.860> to<00:02:26.950> grow<00:02:27.099> on<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.310> side<00:02:27.489> by

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
reason it tends to grow on the side by

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.069 
reason it tends to grow on the side by
the<00:02:27.670> nose<00:02:27.940> is<00:02:28.180> because<00:02:28.360> that<00:02:28.480> area<00:02:28.630> gets<00:02:28.959> a

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:29.079 
the nose is because that area gets a

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:31.319 
the nose is because that area gets a
double<00:02:29.349> dose<00:02:29.500> of<00:02:29.769> the<00:02:29.920> UV<00:02:30.310> both<00:02:30.849> the<00:02:31.030> direct

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
double dose of the UV both the direct

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:34.289 
double dose of the UV both the direct
and<00:02:31.599> the<00:02:32.370> UV<00:02:33.370> that<00:02:33.519> hits<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.760> side<00:02:33.940> wall<00:02:34.180> of

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
and the UV that hits the side wall of

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.390 
and the UV that hits the side wall of
the<00:02:34.390> nose<00:02:34.569> and<00:02:34.780> so<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:35.739> tissue<00:02:35.920> breaks<00:02:36.220> down

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
the nose and so the tissue breaks down

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.680 
the nose and so the tissue breaks down
and<00:02:36.610> then<00:02:36.700> it<00:02:36.849> starts<00:02:37.120> to<00:02:37.180> grow<00:02:37.360> over<00:02:37.569> the

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
and then it starts to grow over the

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.650 
and then it starts to grow over the
surface<00:02:38.140> so<00:02:38.829> exposure<00:02:39.519> to<00:02:39.849> the<00:02:39.970> elements<00:02:40.540> and

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
surface so exposure to the elements and

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.270 
surface so exposure to the elements and
and<00:02:41.079> did<00:02:41.200> you<00:02:41.319> always<00:02:41.650> feel<00:02:41.860> like<00:02:42.010> there<00:02:42.190> was

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
and did you always feel like there was

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.620 
and did you always feel like there was
something<00:02:42.459> in<00:02:42.670> your<00:02:42.700> eye<00:02:42.849> what<00:02:43.239> did<00:02:43.360> it<00:02:43.480> feel

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
something in your eye what did it feel

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.569 
something in your eye what did it feel
like<00:02:43.720> it<00:02:44.290> was<00:02:44.410> just<00:02:44.500> really<00:02:44.709> irritated<00:02:45.370> most

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
like it was just really irritated most

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:47.220 
like it was just really irritated most
of<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:45.850> time<00:02:46.060> it<00:02:46.329> was<00:02:46.450> hard<00:02:46.630> to<00:02:46.750> focus<00:02:46.870> on

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
of the time it was hard to focus on

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.879 
of the time it was hard to focus on
things<00:02:47.470> for<00:02:47.650> large<00:02:48.220> periods<00:02:48.940> of<00:02:49.060> time<00:02:49.269> but<00:02:49.889> so

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:50.889 
things for large periods of time but so

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:52.800 
things for large periods of time but so
really<00:02:51.220> annoying<00:02:51.639> yeah<00:02:51.880> pretty<00:02:52.239> much<00:02:52.359> really

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
really annoying yeah pretty much really

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.539 
really annoying yeah pretty much really
annoying<00:02:53.139> yeah<00:02:53.350> so<00:02:53.950> we<00:02:54.040> have<00:02:54.130> an<00:02:54.220> animation

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
annoying yeah so we have an animation

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.550 
annoying yeah so we have an animation
your<00:02:54.819> doctor<00:02:55.090> she'll<00:02:55.269> walk<00:02:55.540> us<00:02:55.750> through<00:02:55.780> the

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
your doctor she'll walk us through the

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.379 
your doctor she'll walk us through the
procedure<00:02:56.920> we<00:02:57.100> saw<00:02:57.280> some<00:02:57.519> actual<00:02:57.940> images<00:02:58.209> of

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:58.389 
procedure we saw some actual images of

00:02:58.389 --> 00:02:59.430 
procedure we saw some actual images of
the<00:02:58.480> procedure<00:02:58.750> but<00:02:58.870> it<00:02:58.959> walks<00:02:59.139> through<00:02:59.350> what

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
the procedure but it walks through what

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.289 
the procedure but it walks through what
we're<00:02:59.560> seeing<00:02:59.709> here<00:02:59.980> so<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.609> scar<00:03:00.880> tissue<00:03:01.120> is

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
we're seeing here so the scar tissue is

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:02.879 
we're seeing here so the scar tissue is
grown<00:03:01.510> over<00:03:01.690> the<00:03:01.810> eye<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.049> first<00:03:02.260> thing<00:03:02.620> to<00:03:02.739> do

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:02.889 
grown over the eye the first thing to do

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:05.039 
grown over the eye the first thing to do
is<00:03:03.069> to<00:03:03.220> physically<00:03:03.549> remove<00:03:03.819> it<00:03:04.150> that<00:03:04.810> leaves

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
is to physically remove it that leaves

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.809 
is to physically remove it that leaves
behind<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.500> defect<00:03:05.889> over<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.250> surface<00:03:06.639> that

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
behind the defect over the surface that

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.309 
behind the defect over the surface that
could<00:03:06.940> be<00:03:07.060> rough<00:03:07.269> and<00:03:07.389> irritating<00:03:07.480> and<00:03:08.079> allow

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
could be rough and irritating and allow

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.020 
could be rough and irritating and allow
the<00:03:08.380> pterygium<00:03:08.980> to<00:03:09.280> grow<00:03:09.400> back<00:03:09.549> again<00:03:09.609> new

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
the pterygium to grow back again new

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.430 
the pterygium to grow back again new
scar<00:03:10.269> tissue<00:03:10.480> it'll<00:03:10.660> go<00:03:10.720> back<00:03:10.900> so<00:03:11.049> we<00:03:11.079> smooth

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
scar tissue it'll go back so we smooth

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.680 
scar tissue it'll go back so we smooth
that<00:03:11.590> off<00:03:11.799> first<00:03:12.130> then<00:03:12.730> we<00:03:12.850> lift<00:03:13.090> up<00:03:13.239> the<00:03:13.299> free

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
that off first then we lift up the free

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.800 
that off first then we lift up the free
edges<00:03:14.019> of<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.489> natural<00:03:15.489> tissue<00:03:15.700> and<00:03:16.120> put<00:03:16.660> in

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
edges of the natural tissue and put in

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.970 
edges of the natural tissue and put in
medicated<00:03:17.739> sponges<00:03:18.310> to<00:03:19.090> help<00:03:19.720> to<00:03:20.109> prevent<00:03:20.799> the

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
medicated sponges to help to prevent the

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.710 
medicated sponges to help to prevent the
recurrence<00:03:21.310> of<00:03:21.819> the<00:03:21.940> scar<00:03:22.180> tissue<00:03:22.209> this<00:03:22.660> is

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
recurrence of the scar tissue this is

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.129 
recurrence of the scar tissue this is
strong<00:03:23.109> medication<00:03:23.799> that<00:03:24.630> will<00:03:25.630> achieve<00:03:25.870> that

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 
strong medication that will achieve that

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:29.490
