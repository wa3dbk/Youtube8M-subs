for<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.019> board<00:00:25.260> imbalance<00:00:25.710> because<00:00:25.830> I'm<00:00:26.250> not

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
to give us some tips on Heights for your

board and batten
another<00:00:34.739> little<00:00:35.040> design<00:00:35.309> things

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.500 

because<00:00:57.980> my<00:00:58.130> ceilings<00:00:58.489> are<00:00:58.610> so<00:00:58.640> tall<00:00:58.790> Kareena

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
because my ceilings are so tall Kareena

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.490 
because my ceilings are so tall Kareena
suggested<00:01:00.050> that<00:01:00.140> we<00:01:00.260> do<00:01:00.380> the

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
suggested that we do the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.870 
suggested that we do the
board-and-batten<00:01:00.829> at<00:01:01.160> five<00:01:01.340> and<00:01:01.460> a<00:01:01.520> half<00:01:01.640> feet

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
now how high you do yours will depend on

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.649 
now how high you do yours will depend on
how<00:01:04.280> high<00:01:04.430> your<00:01:04.580> ceilings<00:01:04.610> are<00:01:05.089> and<00:01:05.330> how<00:01:05.449> you

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
how high your ceilings are and how you

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.260 
how high your ceilings are and how you
want<00:01:05.750> your<00:01:06.020> gaze<00:01:06.200> to<00:01:06.440> be<00:01:06.560> we<00:01:07.340> used<00:01:07.670> quarter<00:01:08.180> of

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
want your gaze to be we used quarter of

want your gaze to be we used quarter of
an<00:01:08.360> inch<00:01:08.479> by<00:01:08.900> four<00:01:09.409> inch<00:01:09.440> MDF<00:01:10.070> boards<00:01:10.729> and<00:01:10.909> that

an inch by four inch MDF boards and that

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.050 
an inch by four inch MDF boards and that
way<00:01:11.240> they<00:01:11.450> could<00:01:11.630> put<00:01:11.810> right<00:01:12.080> up<00:01:12.229> to<00:01:12.950> our

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
way they could put right up to our

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.130 
way they could put right up to our
baseboards<00:01:14.060> without<00:01:14.360> having<00:01:14.630> to<00:01:14.690> take<00:01:14.869> them

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
baseboards without having to take them

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.620 
baseboards without having to take them
off<00:01:15.320> now<00:01:16.090> depending<00:01:17.090> on<00:01:17.210> what<00:01:17.360> you<00:01:17.479> have

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
access to for a saw you can use a table

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.300

saw a miter saw or a circular saw if you

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.980 
saw a miter saw or a circular saw if you
use<00:01:22.460> a<00:01:22.490> circular<00:01:23.000> saw<00:01:23.180> you'll<00:01:23.390> want<00:01:23.630> to<00:01:23.720> use<00:01:23.810> a

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
use a circular saw you'll want to use a

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.510 
use a circular saw you'll want to use a
square<00:01:24.350> so<00:01:24.500> that<00:01:24.619> your<00:01:24.740> angles<00:01:25.070> are<00:01:25.220> straight

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
square so that your angles are straight

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.370 
square so that your angles are straight
now<00:01:26.090> if<00:01:26.180> you<00:01:26.270> don't<00:01:26.390> have<00:01:26.600> access<00:01:26.900> to<00:01:26.960> a<00:01:27.080> saw

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
most places that you get wood at will

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.779 
most places that you get wood at will
offer<00:01:29.869> one<00:01:30.350> free<00:01:30.590> cut<00:01:30.830> per<00:01:31.130> board<00:01:31.340> so<00:01:31.610> if<00:01:31.670> you

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
offer one free cut per board so if you

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:33.010 
offer one free cut per board so if you
get<00:01:31.940> all<00:01:32.030> of<00:01:32.119> your<00:01:32.240> calculations<00:01:32.810> and

get all of your calculations and

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.050 
get all of your calculations and
measuring<00:01:33.350> done<00:01:33.500> beforehand<00:01:34.100> you<00:01:34.700> can<00:01:34.880> just

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
measuring done beforehand you can just

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.700 
measuring done beforehand you can just
have<00:01:35.210> them<00:01:35.420> cut<00:01:35.690> it<00:01:35.810> there<00:01:36.050> and<00:01:36.259> then<00:01:36.500> bring

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
have them cut it there and then bring

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.560 
have them cut it there and then bring
everything<00:01:36.860> home<00:01:37.340> and<00:01:37.640> place<00:01:37.940> it<00:01:38.090> up<00:01:38.210> on<00:01:38.390> your

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
everything home and place it up on your

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.560 
everything home and place it up on your
walls<00:01:39.130> start<00:01:40.130> with<00:01:40.310> one<00:01:40.580> vertical<00:01:41.090> board<00:01:41.330> and

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
walls start with one vertical board and

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.600 
walls start with one vertical board and
you<00:01:41.840> will<00:01:41.990> nail<00:01:42.259> it<00:01:42.440> to<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:42.619> wall<00:01:42.710> now<00:01:43.369> we<00:01:43.430> have

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
you will nail it to the wall now we have

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.279 
you will nail it to the wall now we have
rounded<00:01:43.910> corners<00:01:44.240> so<00:01:44.420> you<00:01:44.479> can<00:01:44.690> see<00:01:44.960> that<00:01:45.170> we

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
rounded corners so you can see that we

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:47.020 
rounded corners so you can see that we
went<00:01:45.500> in<00:01:45.649> about<00:01:45.920> a<00:01:45.950> quarter<00:01:46.310> to<00:01:46.520> a<00:01:46.550> half<00:01:46.850> an

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
went in about a quarter to a half an

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.480 
went in about a quarter to a half an
inch<00:01:47.119> then<00:01:48.050> you<00:01:48.530> will<00:01:48.679> make<00:01:48.830> a<00:01:48.890> mark<00:01:49.100> from<00:01:49.310> the

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
inch then you will make a mark from the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.609 
inch then you will make a mark from the
top<00:01:49.759> of<00:01:49.910> the<00:01:50.030> board<00:01:50.240> down<00:01:50.690> to<00:01:51.020> where<00:01:51.170> you<00:01:51.380> want

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
top of the board down to where you want

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.609 
top of the board down to where you want
your<00:01:51.800> horizontal<00:01:52.160> board<00:01:52.729> to<00:01:53.240> line<00:01:53.660> up<00:01:53.840> you'll

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
from there we decided to work from the

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.030 
from there we decided to work from the
finishing<00:03:08.880> edge<00:03:09.030> back<00:03:09.570> into<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.320> wall<00:03:10.470> to

00:03:12.900 --> 00:04:22.550 
make sure that both corners of the walls
would<00:03:13.140> have<00:03:13.200> a<00:03:13.350> finishing<00:03:13.830> board<00:03:14.250> on<00:03:14.490> each

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.290
