00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.790
 cornering safety even when looking at the future 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.420
 by leading innovations in automotive safety 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.089
 not defined new criteria in this area 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:19.419
 the anti-lock ABS system and the PCS traction control 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:20.210
 part 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.560
 a new stage is reached with the strict regulation system handed over 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.560
 of dynamic spirit behavior 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.500
 anti-lock braking system hgst anti-skating regulation 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.020
 alain greenhouses are integrated it is done 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.630
 the bns prevents the locking of the wheels under braking without abs it is impossible to 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.630
 curb the entire judiciary 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.240
 the bcr prevents wheel spin on starting on slippery ground 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.580
 when we try to cut a motor attraction is no longer 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.460
 retransmitted by the roadway in case of ice 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.640
 the wheels spin 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.650
 the vehicle of his child instead of climbing 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.980
 when a vehicle is driven too quickly turn over nothing 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.290
 the uncontrollable 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.210
 the centrifugal force the twitter flow of the trajectory and the strength of the book 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.210
 around the vertical axis that leads to lurching 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.130
 the regulation 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.429
 since the chronicles of dynamic behavior 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:34.070
 yet his strengths 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.650
 by a braking impulse targeted on certain roads the respect guy 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.940
 the float and drifts around the vertical bce the vehicle stabilize it the 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.940
 driver in the North Station a perfect mastery 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.700
 another example in any case of understeer the back of a vehicle has 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.000
 started to hunt 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.880
 a deposit of 5000 to 6000 on the front wheel brings the car back into the 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.270
 trajectory desired by the driver in case of sublime understeer vehicles 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.650
 deviates to the outside of the turn by means of a pulse of his age on the 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.690
 rear wheel the car capable of accomplishing it 

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:13.840
 for these are accidents 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.150
 are caused by a driver losing control of the vehicle 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:24.139
 the sp corrects such driving errors by a slight intervention 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:26.349
 on direction 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.349
 back on the roadway 

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:38.439
 even when the situation seems hopeless the spd shows its usefulness in 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:41.439
 this limit area 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:46.509
 dislocation suddenly only the car moves equipped with a summer dsp 

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:48.629
 safely controlled 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:52.519
 the sp provides assistance even when a child also symbolizes 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:53.509
 convinced 2 

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:56.249
 through this contest in front of the car 

00:02:56.249 --> 00:03:00.469
 the braking impulses of the hospice indebtedness identifiable 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:03.469
 the vehicle remains stable 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.200
 the senses-of-mind vehicles are perfectly subject to lurching on 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.749
 leaves 

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:15.749
 the security spin-off 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:21.819
 vesper intervenes faster than the most experienced motorist 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.369
 the brief braking impulse of the six high-level front wheel visits 

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:29.329
 another example with them explains puel 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:33.889
 more troops speed for this bend the force of peyrilles transfer 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:37.919
 front-wheel drive and out-of-turn vehicles although the 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:43.509
 direction be clearly contracted the vehicle can smile he rolls online 

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:44.469
 account 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:48.819
 at an identical speed in the same bend with him this country a pulse of 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.829
 this channel located on the inner rear wheel to the program 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:55.909
 allows to counter the strength of books around the vertical axis the 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:59.020
 crossing the bend it was more baup any security 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.139
 thanks to the spirit 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:04.650
 and it's on ice and snow in a power vehicle of this country the 

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:06.739
 driver has no chance missed 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.739
 an avoidance maneuver 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.120
 the vehicle with the psp it retains however its trajectory even in this 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.340
 case 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.860
 translation into practice 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.759
 sudden avoidance maneuver on icy ground even up to 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:31.309
 wall area 

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:35.569
 a slight shot of driving a car comes back safely on the road 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:39.520
 braking direction 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.520
 make up accidents can be avoided thanks to the spirit 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.770
 respect can not be played physics laws nor replace a style of 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.180
 responsible conduct 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.630
 however, if drivers encounter difficult situations the vehicle 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.440
 is equipped with the system 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.440
 creations 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.270
 offers to 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.629
 and to its passengers a maximum of security
