00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
I must have I must have 15 of them on

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.010 
I must have I must have 15 of them on
film<00:02:54.830> by<00:02:55.130> now

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020

I<00:02:58.050> just<00:02:58.950> came<00:02:59.160> up<00:02:59.220> there<00:02:59.700> was<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.820> cloud<00:03:00.120> bank<00:03:00.390> so

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
I just came up there was a cloud bank so

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:10.690 
I just came up there was a cloud bank so
I<00:03:00.660> couldn't<00:03:00.900> see<00:03:05.360> all<00:03:06.360> right

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.520 

okay<00:03:11.300> here<00:03:11.510> comes<00:03:11.720> another<00:03:11.870> one<00:03:12.110> try<00:03:12.470> to

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
okay here comes another one try to

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.410 
okay here comes another one try to
confirm<00:03:12.950> it<00:03:13.099> live<00:03:13.310> that's<00:03:13.700> coming<00:03:14.120> for<00:03:14.330> the

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
confirm it live that's coming for the

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.930 
confirm it live that's coming for the
equator<00:03:14.750> now<00:03:15.020> down<00:03:15.380> to<00:03:15.560> the<00:03:15.650> lower<00:03:15.860> left<00:03:16.340> lunar

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
equator now down to the lower left lunar

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:24.010 
equator now down to the lower left lunar
limb<00:03:18.190> can<00:03:19.190> you<00:03:19.280> see<00:03:19.489> it<00:03:22.150> okay<00:03:23.150> it<00:03:23.480> just<00:03:23.510> went<00:03:23.900> by

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
limb can you see it okay it just went by

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.540 
limb can you see it okay it just went by
Kepler<00:03:24.349> it's<00:03:24.739> going<00:03:24.890> to<00:03:24.950> go<00:03:25.069> off<00:03:25.220> the<00:03:25.250> lower

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
Kepler it's going to go off the lower

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:35.150 
Kepler it's going to go off the lower
limb<00:03:25.849> now

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:41.740 

you

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.140 

okay<00:03:42.410> here<00:03:42.650> comes<00:03:42.860> the<00:03:43.070> first<00:03:43.310> object<00:03:43.910> which

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
okay here comes the first object which

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.660 
okay here comes the first object which
could<00:03:44.450> not<00:03:44.660> be<00:03:45.020> identified<00:03:45.830> as<00:03:46.100> a<00:03:46.130> registered

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
could not be identified as a registered

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.090 
could not be identified as a registered
satellite<00:03:47.330> this<00:03:48.140> matches<00:03:48.590> a<00:03:48.620> lot<00:03:48.890> of<00:03:49.010> the

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
satellite this matches a lot of the

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.310 
satellite this matches a lot of the
things<00:03:49.340> I<00:03:49.490> shoot<00:03:49.790> and<00:03:50.060> one<00:03:50.900> important<00:03:51.290> thing

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
things I shoot and one important thing

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.870 
things I shoot and one important thing
about<00:03:51.440> this<00:03:51.740> clip<00:03:52.040> is<00:03:52.220> I'm<00:03:52.490> going<00:03:52.580> to<00:03:52.640> show<00:03:52.730> you

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
about this clip is I'm going to show you

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.180 
about this clip is I'm going to show you
the<00:03:53.030> difference<00:03:53.420> between<00:03:54.170> what<00:03:54.590> satellites

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
the difference between what satellites

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.640 
the difference between what satellites
and<00:03:55.490> these<00:03:55.970> unidentifiable<00:03:56.900> objects<00:03:57.500> look

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
and these unidentifiable objects look

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.670 
and these unidentifiable objects look
like<00:03:57.920> here's<00:03:58.790> the<00:03:58.970> second<00:03:59.300> object<00:03:59.450> at<00:03:59.870> 400%

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
like here's the second object at 400%

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.740 
like here's the second object at 400%
zoom<00:04:00.950> that<00:04:01.160> thing<00:04:01.400> that<00:04:01.580> just<00:04:01.760> went<00:04:02.000> by<00:04:02.090> was

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
zoom that thing that just went by was

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.410 
zoom that thing that just went by was
the<00:04:02.780> satellite<00:04:03.530> now<00:04:04.400> you<00:04:04.460> will<00:04:04.820> notice<00:04:05.210> the

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
the satellite now you will notice the

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.600 
the satellite now you will notice the
satellites<00:04:06.020> look<00:04:06.530> very<00:04:06.920> see-through

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
satellites look very see-through

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.960 
satellites look very see-through
probably<00:04:08.210> due<00:04:08.390> to<00:04:08.420> Speed<00:04:08.840> blur<00:04:09.430> and<00:04:10.430> they're

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
probably due to Speed blur and they're

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.540 
probably due to Speed blur and they're
always<00:04:11.300> moving<00:04:11.810> just<00:04:12.200> so<00:04:12.470> fast<00:04:12.860> compared<00:04:13.490> to

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
always moving just so fast compared to

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.490 
always moving just so fast compared to
the<00:04:13.730> objects<00:04:14.150> that<00:04:14.240> I<00:04:14.360> cannot<00:04:14.780> identify<00:04:14.959> as

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
the objects that I cannot identify as

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.920 
the objects that I cannot identify as
satellites<00:04:16.010> now<00:04:16.760> this<00:04:17.000> is<00:04:17.150> the<00:04:17.269> satellite<00:04:17.510> and

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
satellites now this is the satellite and

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.780 
satellites now this is the satellite and
that's<00:04:18.739> in<00:04:18.950> real<00:04:19.190> time<00:04:20.680> 400%<00:04:21.680> zoom<00:04:22.010> if<00:04:22.310> you

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
that's in real time 400% zoom if you

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.180 
that's in real time 400% zoom if you
stop<00:04:23.120> frame<00:04:23.480> it<00:04:23.690> you<00:04:23.930> can<00:04:24.110> see<00:04:24.320> it<00:04:24.470> looks<00:04:24.710> like

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
stop frame it you can see it looks like

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.770 
stop frame it you can see it looks like
a<00:04:25.220> satellite<00:04:25.790> like<00:04:26.030> you<00:04:26.180> would<00:04:26.300> expect<00:04:26.390> a

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
a satellite like you would expect a

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.980 
a satellite like you would expect a
satellite<00:04:27.260> to<00:04:27.440> look<00:04:27.850> here<00:04:28.850> it<00:04:28.970> is<00:04:29.090> at<00:04:29.270> 400%

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
satellite to look here it is at 400%

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.130 
satellite to look here it is at 400%
zoom<00:04:30.290> again<00:04:30.620> and<00:04:30.920> I<00:04:31.790> did<00:04:32.210> ID<00:04:32.420> this<00:04:32.780> as<00:04:32.990> the

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
zoom again and I did ID this as the

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.920 
zoom again and I did ID this as the
bright<00:04:33.380> PL<00:04:33.800> satellite<00:04:34.460> I<00:04:35.000> didn't<00:04:35.600> really<00:04:35.810> have

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
bright PL satellite I didn't really have

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.860 
bright PL satellite I didn't really have
time<00:04:36.200> to<00:04:36.260> look<00:04:36.590> up<00:04:37.120> you<00:04:38.120> know<00:04:38.240> anything<00:04:38.750> about

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
time to look up you know anything about

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.659 
time to look up you know anything about
the<00:04:39.260> satellite<00:04:39.710> but<00:04:39.919> I<00:04:39.950> did<00:04:40.190> confirm<00:04:40.430> that

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
the satellite but I did confirm that

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:44.020 
the satellite but I did confirm that
this<00:04:41.060> is<00:04:41.240> in<00:04:41.419> fact<00:04:41.450> that<00:04:41.960> satellite<00:04:42.820> one<00:04:43.820> thing

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
this is in fact that satellite one thing

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.520 
this is in fact that satellite one thing
we<00:04:44.150> should<00:04:44.210> remember<00:04:44.600> and<00:04:45.020> there's<00:04:45.320> the<00:04:45.440> other

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
we should remember and there's the other

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.380 
we should remember and there's the other
UFO<00:04:45.860> it<00:04:46.160> passed<00:04:46.370> one<00:04:47.000> thing<00:04:47.180> we<00:04:47.330> should

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
UFO it passed one thing we should

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.760 
UFO it passed one thing we should
remember<00:04:47.840> is<00:04:48.260> DSW<00:04:49.330> DSW<00:04:50.330> 74<00:04:50.930> is<00:04:51.080> footage<00:04:51.560> is

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
remember is DSW DSW 74 is footage is

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.700 
remember is DSW DSW 74 is footage is
going<00:04:52.370> through<00:04:52.550> a<00:04:52.610> diagonal<00:04:53.060> which<00:04:53.930> means<00:04:54.290> his

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
going through a diagonal which means his

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.909 
going through a diagonal which means his
image<00:04:55.250> is<00:04:55.490> flipped<00:04:55.790> and<00:04:56.120> reversed<00:04:56.560> I'm<00:04:57.560> not

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
image is flipped and reversed I'm not

00:04:57.919 --> 00:04:59.890 
image is flipped and reversed I'm not
going<00:04:58.250> through<00:04:58.400> a<00:04:58.490> diagonal<00:04:58.880> so<00:04:59.330> when<00:04:59.570> I<00:04:59.600> say

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
going through a diagonal so when I say

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.450 
going through a diagonal so when I say
lower<00:05:00.169> left<00:05:00.500> limb<00:05:00.740> you've<00:05:00.979> got<00:05:01.160> to<00:05:01.280> bear<00:05:01.430> in

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
lower left limb you've got to bear in

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.130 
lower left limb you've got to bear in
mind<00:05:01.580> what<00:05:01.940> you're<00:05:02.090> seeing<00:05:02.330> on<00:05:02.510> his<00:05:02.750> footage

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
mind what you're seeing on his footage

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.490 
mind what you're seeing on his footage
is<00:05:03.320> flipped<00:05:03.890> and<00:05:04.040> reversed<00:05:04.870> so<00:05:05.870> just<00:05:06.140> just<00:05:06.320> so

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
is flipped and reversed so just just so

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.370 
is flipped and reversed so just just so
you<00:05:06.560> know<00:05:06.850> anyhow<00:05:07.850> this<00:05:08.300> is<00:05:08.540> a<00:05:08.570> slowed<00:05:09.350> down

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
you know anyhow this is a slowed down

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.210 
you know anyhow this is a slowed down
50%<00:05:10.130> speed<00:05:10.820> version<00:05:11.210> of<00:05:11.600> the<00:05:12.290> whole<00:05:12.470> clip<00:05:12.800> you

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
50% speed version of the whole clip you

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.460 
50% speed version of the whole clip you
can<00:05:13.400> see<00:05:13.610> the<00:05:13.760> object<00:05:14.240> moving<00:05:14.810> down<00:05:15.020> towards

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
can see the object moving down towards

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.469 
can see the object moving down towards
the<00:05:15.710> middle<00:05:16.250> center<00:05:16.669> there<00:05:16.850> that's<00:05:17.090> the<00:05:17.270> first

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 
the middle center there that's the first

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:20.530 
the middle center there that's the first
object<00:05:18.050> and<00:05:18.320> in<00:05:18.830> a<00:05:18.919> second<00:05:19.370> in<00:05:19.490> the<00:05:19.880> top<00:05:20.120> center

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:20.540 
object and in a second in the top center

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.120 
object and in a second in the top center
of<00:05:20.570> the<00:05:20.690> screen<00:05:20.780> the<00:05:21.290> other<00:05:21.410> object<00:05:21.919> is<00:05:21.979> gonna

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
of the screen the other object is gonna

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.700 
of the screen the other object is gonna
come<00:05:22.370> in<00:05:22.580> and<00:05:22.760> at<00:05:23.150> the<00:05:23.180> lower<00:05:23.510> right<00:05:23.900> limb<00:05:24.260> the

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
come in and at the lower right limb the

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.380 
come in and at the lower right limb the
satellite<00:05:25.220> will<00:05:25.430> come<00:05:25.610> in<00:05:25.760> at<00:05:25.910> just<00:05:25.940> about<00:05:26.330> the

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
satellite will come in at just about the

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.770 
satellite will come in at just about the
same<00:05:26.540> time<00:05:27.250> so<00:05:28.250> here<00:05:28.790> comes<00:05:29.060> the<00:05:29.330> black<00:05:29.540> object

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
same time so here comes the black object

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.900 
same time so here comes the black object
at<00:05:30.200> the<00:05:30.290> top<00:05:30.320> and<00:05:30.770> the<00:05:30.919> satellites<00:05:31.460> already<00:05:31.700> at

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
at the top and the satellites already at

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.400 
at the top and the satellites already at
the<00:05:32.060> equator<00:05:32.360> heading<00:05:32.870> towards<00:05:33.200> it<00:05:33.380> now

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
the equator heading towards it now

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.080 
the equator heading towards it now
they're<00:05:33.740> gonna<00:05:33.830> cross<00:05:34.220> each<00:05:34.490> other's<00:05:34.820> paths

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
they're gonna cross each other's paths

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.070 
they're gonna cross each other's paths
right<00:05:35.540> there<00:05:36.970> to<00:05:37.970> my<00:05:38.120> knowledge<00:05:38.330> this<00:05:38.750> never

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
right there to my knowledge this never

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.050 
right there to my knowledge this never
been<00:05:39.320> done<00:05:39.560> not<00:05:40.220> only<00:05:40.280> does<00:05:40.640> it<00:05:40.669> prove<00:05:41.030> that

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
been done not only does it prove that

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.560 
been done not only does it prove that
these<00:05:41.450> objects<00:05:41.990> are<00:05:42.169> in<00:05:42.290> space<00:05:43.000> but<00:05:44.000> it<00:05:44.210> shows

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
these objects are in space but it shows

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.840 
these objects are in space but it shows
the<00:05:44.960> difference<00:05:45.410> between<00:05:45.650> satellites<00:05:46.580> and

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
the difference between satellites and

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.380 
the difference between satellites and
the<00:05:47.180> objects<00:05:47.600> we<00:05:47.810> cannot<00:05:48.229> identify<00:05:49.180> which<00:05:50.180> we

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:50.390 
the objects we cannot identify which we

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.050 
the objects we cannot identify which we
call<00:05:50.630> UFOs<00:05:51.229> and<00:05:51.590> if<00:05:52.130> you<00:05:52.250> look<00:05:52.400> at<00:05:52.520> my<00:05:52.640> channel

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
call UFOs and if you look at my channel

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.670 
call UFOs and if you look at my channel
there's<00:05:53.419> a<00:05:53.479> lot<00:05:53.660> of<00:05:53.780> objects<00:05:54.169> that<00:05:54.349> look<00:05:54.500> like

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
there's a lot of objects that look like

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.450 
there's a lot of objects that look like
this

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
this

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.020 
this
this<00:05:56.120> is<00:05:56.360> not<00:05:56.690> loan<00:05:57.319> sightings<00:05:57.949> you<00:05:58.669> know<00:05:58.789> in<00:05:58.940> a

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.030 
this is not loan sightings you know in a

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.840 
this is not loan sightings you know in a
vacuum<00:05:59.240> I<00:05:59.750> have<00:06:00.470> filmed<00:06:00.740> many<00:06:01.130> many<00:06:01.460> things

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:01.850 
vacuum I have filmed many many things

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.730 
vacuum I have filmed many many things
that<00:06:02.090> have<00:06:02.300> this<00:06:02.539> look<00:06:02.900> that<00:06:03.169> could<00:06:03.319> not<00:06:03.530> be

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
that have this look that could not be

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.550 
that have this look that could not be
identified<00:06:04.300> anyhow<00:06:05.300> there<00:06:05.780> it<00:06:05.930> is<00:06:06.080> this<00:06:06.349> was

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
identified anyhow there it is this was

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.980 
identified anyhow there it is this was
the<00:06:06.710> night<00:06:06.889> of<00:06:06.919> the<00:06:07.130> April<00:06:07.610> 2014<00:06:08.180> Eclipse<00:06:08.750> and

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
the night of the April 2014 Eclipse and

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.659 
the night of the April 2014 Eclipse and
I<00:06:09.560> think<00:06:09.800> we<00:06:09.919> might<00:06:10.130> have<00:06:10.160> made<00:06:10.250> some<00:06:10.550> history

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:10.669 
I think we might have made some history

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:13.330 
I think we might have made some history
this<00:06:11.060> night<00:06:11.300> stay<00:06:12.169> tuned<00:06:12.470> I<00:06:12.770> have<00:06:12.830> a<00:06:13.009> hundred

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.340 
this night stay tuned I have a hundred

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.560 
this night stay tuned I have a hundred
and<00:06:13.610> thirty<00:06:13.849> clips<00:06:14.210> to<00:06:14.419> get<00:06:14.569> through<00:06:14.900> Cheers
