00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
that you've been able to put around

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.990 
that you've been able to put around
yourself<00:01:30.810> through<00:01:31.020> breathing<00:01:31.439> exercises<00:01:35.000> do

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
yourself through breathing exercises do

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.630 
yourself through breathing exercises do
you<00:01:36.090> think<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.509> can<00:01:36.689> use<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:37.079> few<00:01:37.350> white<00:01:38.310> light

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
you think you can use a few white light

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.030 
you think you can use a few white light
or<00:01:39.180> but<00:01:39.780> it's<00:01:39.930> it's<00:01:40.229> more<00:01:40.320> than<00:01:40.650> just<00:01:40.710> a

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
or but it's it's more than just a

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.510 
or but it's it's more than just a
visualization<00:01:41.689> I<00:01:42.689> sort<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.740> describe<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.340> as

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
visualization I sort of describe it as

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.819 
visualization I sort of describe it as
you<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.240> know<00:01:45.329> it's<00:01:45.570> almost<00:01:45.780> like<00:01:45.960> getting

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
you you know it's almost like getting

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.399 
you you know it's almost like getting
psyched<00:01:47.430> for<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.790> big<00:01:48.000> game<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:49.110> know<00:01:49.170> said

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
psyched for the big game you know said

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.550 
psyched for the big game you know said
you<00:01:50.360> know<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.540> don't<00:01:51.600> even<00:01:51.810> know<00:01:51.930> how<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.110> put<00:01:52.409> it

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
you know I don't even know how to put it

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.310 
you know I don't even know how to put it
in<00:01:52.649> words<00:01:52.860> but<00:01:53.220> it's<00:01:53.340> like<00:01:53.490> feeling<00:01:54.270> this<00:01:54.659> this

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
in words but it's like feeling this this

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.749 
in words but it's like feeling this this
barrier<00:01:56.100> this<00:01:56.310> shield<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.920> this<00:01:58.920> force<00:01:59.310> field

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
barrier this shield is this force field

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.770 
barrier this shield is this force field
around<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.869> then<00:02:01.110> really<00:02:01.680> pumping<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.310> up

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
around you and then really pumping it up

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.560 
around you and then really pumping it up
I<00:02:03.780> think<00:02:04.049> I<00:02:04.469> was<00:02:04.649> able<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.130> fend<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:06.060> one<00:02:06.270> off

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
I think I was able to fend this one off

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.980 
I think I was able to fend this one off
it<00:02:06.899> was<00:02:07.049> he<00:02:07.290> was<00:02:07.439> pretty<00:02:07.680> strong<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.369> then

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
it was he was pretty strong and then
