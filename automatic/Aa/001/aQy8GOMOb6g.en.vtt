00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
thing to note here when you're using

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.550 
thing to note here when you're using
that<00:01:30.450> wd-40<00:01:31.450> or<00:01:31.479> whatever<00:01:31.869> you're<00:01:32.079> using<00:01:32.110> for

lubricant<00:01:33.070> you<00:01:33.610> can<00:01:33.819> lose<00:01:34.270> your<00:01:34.720> trace<00:01:35.079> line

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
lubricant you can lose your trace line

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.260 
lubricant you can lose your trace line
so<00:01:36.039> that's<00:01:36.130> why<00:01:36.310> I<00:01:36.369> like<00:01:36.579> to<00:01:36.729> come<00:01:36.909> in<00:01:37.000> here<00:01:37.119> and

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
drill the holes first then I just put

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.700 
drill the holes first then I just put
the<00:01:39.159> template<00:01:39.460> back<00:01:39.640> on<00:01:39.819> top<00:01:40.060> and<00:01:40.679> retrace<00:01:41.679> my

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
lines you can see it's kind of faded up

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.399

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
using a hole saw bit where I need to use

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.070 
using a hole saw bit where I need to use
lubricant<00:01:56.709> that<00:01:57.369> when<00:01:57.909> I<00:01:57.939> go<00:01:58.149> to<00:01:58.209> wipe<00:01:58.780> it<00:01:58.959> all

my template and read all my lines and so

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.100 
my template and read all my lines and so
now<00:02:31.709> we're<00:02:31.890> gonna<00:02:31.980> look<00:02:32.879> at<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.269> angle

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
now we're gonna look at the angle

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.360 
now we're gonna look at the angle
grinder<00:02:34.200> with<00:02:34.500> a<00:02:34.560> cut-off<00:02:34.799> disc<00:02:35.040> we're<00:02:35.250> going

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
grinder with a cut-off disc we're going
