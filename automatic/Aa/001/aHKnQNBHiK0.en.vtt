place<00:01:20.409> in<00:01:20.710> a<00:01:21.130> former<00:01:21.610> day<00:01:22.500> I'm<00:01:23.500> starting<00:01:23.979> with

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
place in a former day I'm starting with

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.340 
place in a former day I'm starting with
a<00:01:24.189> cylinder<00:01:24.729> of<00:01:24.820> red<00:01:25.060> oak<00:01:25.299> I've<00:01:25.810> marked<00:01:26.170> it

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
a cylinder of red oak I've marked it

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.350 
a cylinder of red oak I've marked it
with<00:01:26.380> approximate<00:01:27.369> divisions<00:01:27.820> for<00:01:28.030> the<00:01:28.090> point

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
with approximate divisions for the point

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.539 
with approximate divisions for the point
each<00:01:28.780> turning<00:01:29.320> axis<00:01:29.770> and<00:01:29.979> a<00:01:30.219> handle

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
each turning axis and a handle

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:32.639 
each turning axis and a handle
transition<00:01:31.180> I'll<00:01:31.360> leave<00:01:31.719> the<00:01:31.930> point<00:01:32.200> portion

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
transition I'll leave the point portion

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:34.859 
transition I'll leave the point portion
square<00:01:33.009> to<00:01:33.399> preserve<00:01:33.789> as<00:01:34.119> much<00:01:34.509> wood<00:01:34.810> as

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
square to preserve as much wood as

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.010 
square to preserve as much wood as
possible<00:01:35.649> otherwise<00:01:36.280> I<00:01:36.880> fear<00:01:37.450> the<00:01:37.570> wood<00:01:37.780> may

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
possible otherwise I fear the wood may

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.719 
possible otherwise I fear the wood may
split<00:01:38.380> is<00:01:38.680> too<00:01:38.920> near<00:01:39.130> the<00:01:39.159> edge

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
split is too near the edge

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.240 
split is too near the edge
I've<00:01:40.299> also<00:01:40.570> pre<00:01:41.049> drilled<00:01:41.380> a<00:01:41.530> hole<00:01:41.560> for<00:01:42.130> the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
I've also pre drilled a hole for the

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.899 
I've also pre drilled a hole for the
tailstock<00:01:42.609> at<00:01:43.000> each<00:01:43.329> axis<00:01:44.049> point<00:01:44.439> again<00:01:45.369> so

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
tailstock at each axis point again so

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:47.459 
tailstock at each axis point again so
the<00:01:46.030> wood<00:01:46.210> will<00:01:46.390> not<00:01:46.539> split<00:01:46.810> when<00:01:47.079> I<00:01:47.109> change

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:47.469 
the wood will not split when I change

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:50.520 
the wood will not split when I change
the<00:01:47.649> axis<00:01:48.039> each<00:01:48.579> of<00:01:48.969> the<00:01:49.149> four<00:01:49.359> axis<00:01:49.840> holes<00:01:50.079> is

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
the axis each of the four axis holes is

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.190 
the axis each of the four axis holes is
about<00:01:50.950> one<00:01:51.490> quarter<00:01:51.700> inch<00:01:52.060> off<00:01:52.299> center<00:01:52.359> I've

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
about one quarter inch off center I've

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.139 
about one quarter inch off center I've
shifted<00:01:53.469> the<00:01:53.770> wood<00:01:53.950> to<00:01:54.130> the<00:01:54.219> first<00:01:54.490> eccentric

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
shifted the wood to the first eccentric

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:57.539 
shifted the wood to the first eccentric
axis<00:01:55.570> with<00:01:56.170> a<00:01:56.200> gouge<00:01:56.500> I'll<00:01:56.829> carefully<00:01:57.189> cut

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
axis with a gouge I'll carefully cut

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:59.910 
axis with a gouge I'll carefully cut
away<00:01:57.670> the<00:01:57.969> ghost<00:01:58.270> image<00:01:58.630> until<00:01:59.200> I<00:01:59.259> see<00:01:59.530> solid

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
away the ghost image until I see solid

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.900 
away the ghost image until I see solid
wood<00:02:00.130> even<00:02:00.759> then<00:02:01.240> it's<00:02:01.719> not<00:02:02.109> quite<00:02:02.530> round

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.820 

then<00:02:05.910> I'll<00:02:06.030> apply<00:02:06.270> my<00:02:06.540> beeswax<00:02:07.140> mineral<00:02:07.620> oil

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
then I'll apply my beeswax mineral oil

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.550 
then I'll apply my beeswax mineral oil
mix<00:02:08.130> and<00:02:08.399> send<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.880> first<00:02:09.030> area<00:02:09.450> I'll<00:02:10.110> start

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
mix and send the first area I'll start

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.030 
mix and send the first area I'll start
this<00:02:11.130> time<00:02:11.400> at<00:02:11.640> 120<00:02:12.570> grit<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:13.020> go<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.290> 400<00:02:13.920> grit

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
this time at 120 grit and go to 400 grit

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.000 
this time at 120 grit and go to 400 grit
adding<00:02:14.910> more<00:02:15.060> sanding<00:02:15.510> media<00:02:15.870> as<00:02:16.080> necessary

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
adding more sanding media as necessary

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.580 
adding more sanding media as necessary
finally<00:02:17.760> I<00:02:17.910> give<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.600> spin<00:02:18.870> at<00:02:19.020> high<00:02:19.230> speed

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
finally I give it a spin at high speed

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.090 
finally I give it a spin at high speed

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
to melt in the wax and the oil mix then

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.640 
to melt in the wax and the oil mix then
carefully<00:02:23.670> move<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.390> live<00:02:24.720> Center<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.530> the

portion I'm working on that's

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.699 
portion I'm working on that's
counterproductive<00:03:25.319> there's<00:03:26.319> some<00:03:26.500> pretty

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
counterproductive there's some pretty

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.280 
counterproductive there's some pretty
wild<00:03:26.980> chatter<00:03:27.430> if<00:03:28.120> I<00:03:28.330> could<00:03:28.540> only<00:03:28.780> get<00:03:29.110> that

wild chatter if I could only get that

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
chatter that good what I wanted I'll

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.520 
chatter that good what I wanted I'll
crank<00:03:33.850> up<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.150> RPMs<00:03:34.569> but<00:03:34.900> there's<00:03:35.080> a<00:03:35.140> limit<00:03:35.500> to

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
what I feel safe to run at I'll try

00:03:37.750 --> 00:04:37.620 
what I feel safe to run at I'll try
askew<00:03:38.230> but

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.230 

again<00:04:38.350> sand<00:04:38.890> and<00:04:39.160> finish<00:04:39.310> the<00:04:39.610> segment<00:04:40.090> well

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
again sand and finish the segment well

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.570 
again sand and finish the segment well
again<00:04:40.600> this<00:04:41.290> segment<00:04:41.770> took<00:04:41.920> more<00:04:42.130> sanding

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
again this segment took more sanding

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.010 
again this segment took more sanding
than<00:04:42.910> the<00:04:43.060> previous<00:04:43.420> ones

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020

now for the fourth axis I'm now getting

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.870

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.910 

again<00:05:15.040> sand<00:05:15.640> and<00:05:15.910> finish<00:05:16.180> this<00:05:16.600> segment<00:05:16.920> now

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:17.920 
again sand and finish this segment now

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.530 
again sand and finish this segment now
for<00:05:18.190> the<00:05:18.280> transition<00:05:18.790> to<00:05:18.910> the<00:05:19.030> handle

for the transition to the handle
I'll<00:05:19.870> taper<00:05:20.170> it<00:05:20.380> down<00:05:20.410> then<00:05:20.920> form<00:05:21.280> somewhat<00:05:21.820> of

I'll taper it down then form somewhat of

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.710 

now<00:05:49.190> to<00:05:49.250> cut<00:05:49.580> the<00:05:49.610> tenon<00:05:50.060> in<00:05:50.240> two<00:05:50.450> stages

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
now to cut the tenon in two stages

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.740
