 she would step out of work and now has 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.460
 he played such music 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.110
 but the virus manager turned out afterwards 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.940
 not really the music but just one 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.310
 car important itself the two I thought 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.140
 so how nice he can sing solar 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.200

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.100

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.149

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.410

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.720
 the artists earn money via spotify 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.400
 in fact far too few say themselves 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.180
 because a lot more goes to the company 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.849
 and they don't see much of that 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.290

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.790

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.090

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.980
 for cute spotify we go times 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.790
 so if you use ridicule 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.819
 in a 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.719
 I want to give even more money to the 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.480

 CD seemed to put all together 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.359
 the economy of cleaning up therefore 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.519
 that CDs were all music 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:21.569

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.200

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:27.989
 so mp3the urge room is the area code 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.549

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.840
 continued clicking without one 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.340
 screen will be on if you then 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.560
 for example ben number one was here 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.909
 to the 30 you have to click 30 times and 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.680
 I also did not know exactly where the number 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:39.959
 30 tons arts Netherlands you are all mine 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.950

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.359

 which could give a budget chokma 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.819
 but all did not properly look at you 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.500
 she made such a number in 1990 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:03.299
 eventually had an afternoon that all 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:06.090

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.500
