00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.460
 another murder conception today 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.010
 i will show you not enough items for the 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.010
 minecraft version 1.4 point 7 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:31.599
 yes 14.7 it is not directly out but 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.000
 you can also use it for the 14.7 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.519
 shows you also at the end of the videos sees 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.579
 so it was installed more like the 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:42.879
 ingame part yes what does the mod he is 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:47.309
 as it were romania plus it is one 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:50.979
 bit with larger benefits, I think 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:54.970
 because you are just as fond of doing so 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:58.120
 this trash can for rain creative mode 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.890
 and so it was day and night and healing 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.829
 but he still has new ones 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.880
 things you can do with magnet too 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:09.130
 make the mode quieter first 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.119
 tasks are so magnetic mode 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:21.850
 let's say we have a few now 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:23.860
 things that I can now all not 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.140
 to collect because I'm away because then 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.119
 which magnet mode anschalte they come 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.549
 all to me 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:35.229
 the relatively cool is only certain 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:37.000
 Range will be the distance though 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.390
 I stop then click on it 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.950
 all the world as well as williams yes 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.350
 You can go see you now 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.570
 hold an item and then crush it 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:51.270
 you see how it is cooked that is 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:54.159
 relatively useful to figure out 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.850
 strong as in certain motto 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.560
 recipes are 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.000
 I have it already, too 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.850
 often done at a place review or 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.409
 so that's pretty useful because not 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.840
 Everyone has their strength 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.619
 listed recipes and you have to persist 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.109
 press escape to make this mode like this 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:15.010
 yes to finish or you can believe me 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:15.989
 also the problem from you can also 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.880
 press once 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.170
 yes and here's the creative 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.420
 motors then you are for example 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.600
 There is survival mode in survival mode 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.730
 that is also the case here 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.950
 creative mode in creative mode you have 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.750
 not because all items have this 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.820
 is a bit silly for me but is 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.220
 it's not that bad at half time only in the 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:40.140
 adventure mode 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.460
 and in the wasgau murder is also 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.080
 somehow so creative but there is 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.170
 stop creative with too many as 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.450
 probably yes and has in survival 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.370
 I do not know which and somehow 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.190
 not in it is no idea but the mod 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.420
 is really really cool 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.330
 just how much here you can exactly 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.040
 Things like tutti items do 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.870
 to save comment 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.090
 then you can also click options 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.630
 You can either do that or one 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.750
 turn off 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.480
 the mode recipe mode so stop what 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.150
 note that's deep red could just be easy 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.500
 Only when you have a mouse on 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.830
 something cheerfully then crushed you can do that 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.180
 knock sap but look at the recipe only 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.820
 the recipes and I know that unfortunately 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.280
 not then you can still do that here 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.320
 layout see from me the items to 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.600
 example, this is the layout who 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.980
 is the scooter can find this here 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.680
 also use that is not bad either 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.670
 also looks very smart so not so 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:38.610
 gray as before 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.320
 yes and the other things here you can 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.709
 to adjust a few other things 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.090
 so just controls and otherwise 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.920
 you really do not need to know anything 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.650
 the moth is really not further 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.350
 To know the bot so I mean I am 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.590
 I'm a bit confused 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.060
 since the water network also ingame part I 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.440
 then tell you now on the desktop 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.440
 installation to the same 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.030
 so now we are back on the desktop 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.820
 installations until not enough items bot 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.900
 you need these two of these three 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:16.040
 files the minecraft fortune still so 2 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.390
 just go to the link for that 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.010
 I like to set the description 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.310
 will the money just goes down and 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.050
 because all three open on download then 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.460
 We just start and he's the window 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.270
 execution and give there percent 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.820
 appdata percent impress more 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.220
 to obstruct the one from the folder 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.250
 a right click on the minecraft 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.450
 open with in rar archive I like that today 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.360
 I'm not confused either 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.640
 what's going on is good first of all, of course 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.930
 always looking for the meter in the folder and 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.270
 then delete this when the minecraft 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.340
 Keep all files and drag them 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.020
 just in the minecraft yes demeter 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.320
 in the folder of the mine chris porter 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.940
 is important to press ok then 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.480
 we really need to minecraft once 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.460
 to open 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.780
 This time there is nothing with mode folder 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.970
 create manually 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.050
 this time we really have to 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.090
 bit minecraft right once 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.280
 Start did not last long with you 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:13.729
 will then forge that bar that lasts 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:16.360
 a little bit longer than me now 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:16.360
 will be even capable 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:32.630
 minecraft tasks are not bad either 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:38.060
 ok then we can minecraft again 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:40.490
 close then no we do not want that 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:45.770
 then there is a new folder 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:47.570
 We made it back again and again 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.840
 then the choir bot was formed 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:52.550
 There will be nothing in there for you 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.950
 and then just take the two stars 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.300
 and just pull them in there first 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.540
 Progress should always be your influence 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.190
 start and then just load the files into 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.110
 draw compote and already is the mod 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.030
 installed when it comes to what problems 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.700
 Just write in the comments 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.140
 otherwise I thank you for seeing 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.010
 I wish you nice day and 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.010
