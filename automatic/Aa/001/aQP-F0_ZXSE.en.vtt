maybe<00:01:50.860> even<00:01:51.100> a<00:01:51.280> third<00:01:51.520> since<00:01:51.850> we<00:01:52.000> are<00:01:52.150> painting

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
maybe even a third since we are painting

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.770 
maybe even a third since we are painting
over<00:01:52.930> this<00:01:53.080> gray<00:01:53.920> color<00:01:54.220> without<00:01:55.210> using<00:01:55.600> a

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
over this gray color without using a

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.020 
over this gray color without using a
primer<00:01:56.100> but<00:01:57.100> i'm<00:01:57.280> okay<00:01:57.550> with<00:01:57.580> that<00:01:57.729> because

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
primer but i'm okay with that because

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.640 
primer but i'm okay with that because
the<00:01:58.570> ceilings<00:01:58.960> will<00:01:59.050> end<00:01:59.140> up<00:01:59.260> being<00:01:59.290> a<00:01:59.560> little

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
the ceilings will end up being a little

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.290 
the ceilings will end up being a little
bit<00:01:59.800> lighter<00:02:00.100> than<00:02:00.250> the<00:02:00.610> walls<00:02:00.820> and<00:02:01.060> i<00:02:01.119> think

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
bit lighter than the walls and i think

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.730 
bit lighter than the walls and i think
that's<00:02:01.450> going<00:02:01.540> to<00:02:01.600> be<00:02:01.720> really<00:02:01.840> nice<00:02:02.170> and<00:02:02.470> lift

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
that's going to be really nice and lift

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.900 
that's going to be really nice and lift
the<00:02:03.010> view<00:02:03.250> up<00:02:05.280> also<00:02:06.280> you<00:02:06.550> want<00:02:06.580> to<00:02:06.729> make<00:02:06.790> sure
