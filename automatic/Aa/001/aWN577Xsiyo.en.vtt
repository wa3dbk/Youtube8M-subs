with<00:00:47.280> good<00:00:47.670> water<00:00:48.179> dev<00:00:48.769> let's<00:00:49.769> connect<00:00:50.159> a<00:00:50.339> name

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:50.639 
with good water dev let's connect a name

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
with good water dev let's connect a name
there<00:00:50.940> Jack<00:00:51.269> Bauer<00:00:51.659> of<00:00:52.079> course<00:00:53.059> start<00:00:54.059> wait
