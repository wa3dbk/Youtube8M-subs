00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
enough to him over children aid in there

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.600 
enough to him over children aid in there
you<00:01:31.200> couldn't<00:01:31.439> do<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.530> lot<00:01:31.740> it's<00:01:32.189> kind<00:01:32.549> of

you couldn't do a lot it's kind of

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.880 
you couldn't do a lot it's kind of
better<00:01:32.759> for<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.090> first<00:01:33.299> few<00:01:33.540> rounds<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:34.680> come

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
better for the first few rounds you come

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.910 
better for the first few rounds you come
on<00:01:35.100> out

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.509 

just<00:01:39.130> west<00:01:39.369> around<00:01:39.670> if<00:01:39.880> you<00:01:40.000> guys<00:01:40.119> watch
