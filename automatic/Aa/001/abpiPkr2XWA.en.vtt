Pluto<00:00:08.400> was<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.820> underdog<00:00:09.179> even<00:00:10.080> though<00:00:10.230> it

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
Pluto was the underdog even though it

Pluto was the underdog even though it
was<00:00:10.410> much<00:00:10.559> smaller<00:00:10.920> than<00:00:11.099> all<00:00:11.370> of<00:00:11.429> its

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
was much smaller than all of its

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.160 
was much smaller than all of its
neighbors<00:00:11.730> it<00:00:12.179> was<00:00:12.300> still<00:00:12.540> planet<00:00:13.019> and

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
neighbors it was still planet and

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.829 
neighbors it was still planet and
everybody<00:00:13.920> loved<00:00:14.190> it<00:00:14.309> but<00:00:15.000> one<00:00:15.179> day<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.599> evil

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
everybody loved it but one day the evil

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.750 
everybody loved it but one day the evil
scientists<00:00:16.650> came<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.039> decided<00:00:17.369> that<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.550> must

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
be revoked of its rangas planet because

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.050 
be revoked of its rangas planet because
it<00:00:20.039> was<00:00:20.189> too<00:00:20.460> small<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:21.359> heard<00:00:21.810> about<00:00:21.900> Pluto

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
it was too small I heard about Pluto

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.790 
it was too small I heard about Pluto
it's<00:00:24.060> messed<00:00:24.269> up<00:00:24.390> right<00:00:24.600> well<00:00:25.019> Pluto<00:00:25.410> being

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
it's messed up right well Pluto being

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.009 
it's messed up right well Pluto being
too<00:00:25.980> small<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.490> only<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.789> part<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.689> reason

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
too small is only a part of the reason

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.950 
too small is only a part of the reason
that<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.349> got<00:00:28.470> demoted<00:00:29.119> the<00:00:30.119> discovery<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.810> a

that it got demoted the discovery of a

that it got demoted the discovery of a
ninth<00:00:31.199> planet<00:00:31.500> somewhere<00:00:32.070> past<00:00:32.279> Uranus<00:00:32.850> was

ninth planet somewhere past Uranus was
predicted<00:00:33.540> by<00:00:33.630> astronomers<00:00:34.290> long<00:00:34.770> before

Pluto was discovered in 1930 when it was
finally<00:00:38.520> found<00:00:38.850> astronomers<00:00:39.540> noticed<00:00:39.719> that

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
finally found astronomers noticed that

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.569 
finally found astronomers noticed that
it<00:00:40.170> was<00:00:40.290> much<00:00:40.469> smaller<00:00:40.890> than<00:00:41.160> all<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.460> other

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
it was much smaller than all the other

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.670 
it was much smaller than all the other
planets<00:00:41.910> but<00:00:42.780> they<00:00:42.960> loved<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.290> anyways<00:00:43.649> and

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
planets but they loved it anyways and

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.110 
planets but they loved it anyways and
made<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.160> ninth<00:00:44.399> planet<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.969> our<00:00:45.090> solar

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
made the ninth planet of our solar

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.959 
made the ninth planet of our solar
system<00:00:45.870> for<00:00:46.350> about<00:00:46.530> 75<00:00:47.100> years<00:00:47.280> children<00:00:47.700> were

taught the nine planets of our solar
system<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:50.129> everybody<00:00:50.610> was<00:00:50.940> happy<00:00:51.350> but

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
system and everybody was happy but

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.959 
system and everybody was happy but
things<00:00:52.559> changed<00:00:53.070> as<00:00:53.160> our<00:00:53.280> telescopes<00:00:53.760> got

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
things changed as our telescopes got

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:54.860 
things changed as our telescopes got
better<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.480> better

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
better and better

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.700 
better and better

little<00:01:02.940> bit<00:01:03.149> smaller<00:01:03.890> astronomers<00:01:04.890> began<00:01:05.040> to

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
little bit smaller astronomers began to

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.830 
little bit smaller astronomers began to
worry<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.580> they<00:01:05.760> might<00:01:05.880> find<00:01:06.119> more<00:01:06.330> objects

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
worry that they might find more objects

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.929 
worry that they might find more objects
like<00:01:06.990> these<00:01:07.110> nearby<00:01:07.439> if<00:01:08.250> they<00:01:08.549> were<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.790> find

an object that was even bigger than
Pluto<00:01:10.560> they<00:01:11.040> would<00:01:11.130> have<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.340> reconsider<00:01:11.939> its

from being considered a planet well I

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.830

see<00:02:26.150> Pluto<00:02:26.480> go

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
see Pluto go

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.490
