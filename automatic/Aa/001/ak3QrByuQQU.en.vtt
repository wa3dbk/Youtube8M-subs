okay<00:00:05.930> in<00:00:06.080> this<00:00:06.170> video<00:00:06.380> we're<00:00:06.860> gonna<00:00:06.980> look<00:00:07.160> on

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:08.170 
okay in this video we're gonna look on

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.140 
okay in this video we're gonna look on
doin<00:00:09.170> false<00:00:09.470> in<00:00:09.860> the<00:00:10.309> different<00:00:10.970> flight

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
doin false in the different flight

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.920 
doin false in the different flight
orientations<00:00:12.010> as<00:00:13.010> you<00:00:13.100> can<00:00:13.250> see<00:00:13.750> follows<00:00:14.750> are

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:14.930 
orientations as you can see follows are

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.690 
orientations as you can see follows are
pretty<00:00:15.290> much<00:00:15.380> just<00:00:15.560> like<00:00:15.710> circles<00:00:16.220> except

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:16.700 
pretty much just like circles except

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.970 
pretty much just like circles except
you're<00:00:16.910> flying<00:00:17.480> sideways<00:00:17.900> now<00:00:18.439> the<00:00:18.860> way<00:00:18.950> I

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
you're flying sideways now the way I

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.030 
you're flying sideways now the way I
recommend<00:00:19.340> to<00:00:19.580> get<00:00:19.670> into<00:00:19.910> a<00:00:19.939> fall<00:00:20.470> is<00:00:21.470> to<00:00:21.529> start

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:22.040 
recommend to get into a fall is to start

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.830 
recommend to get into a fall is to start
the<00:00:22.160> circle<00:00:22.550> that<00:00:22.700> you're<00:00:22.910> that<00:00:23.450> you're<00:00:23.570> used

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
the circle that you're that you're used

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.749 
the circle that you're that you're used
to<00:00:23.990> in<00:00:24.380> the<00:00:24.590> direction<00:00:24.710> of<00:00:25.099> travel<00:00:25.340> on<00:00:25.579> them

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:25.759 
to in the direction of travel on them

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.540 
to in the direction of travel on them
and<00:00:26.210> slowly<00:00:26.660> work<00:00:27.020> the<00:00:27.169> tail<00:00:27.380> around<00:00:27.550> until

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
and slowly work the tail around until

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.450 
and slowly work the tail around until
you're<00:00:28.700> in<00:00:28.759> a<00:00:28.849> sideways<00:00:29.270> flight<00:00:29.599> orientation

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
you're in a sideways flight orientation

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.280 
you're in a sideways flight orientation
and<00:00:31.460> it<00:00:32.450> takes<00:00:32.660> a<00:00:32.750> little<00:00:32.840> bit<00:00:32.960> of<00:00:33.050> practice

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
and it takes a little bit of practice

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.440 
and it takes a little bit of practice
but<00:00:33.829> essentially<00:00:34.790> what<00:00:34.940> you're<00:00:35.060> gonna<00:00:35.210> learn

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
but essentially what you're gonna learn

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.130 
but essentially what you're gonna learn
is<00:00:35.840> how<00:00:36.110> to<00:00:37.010> get<00:00:37.370> yourself<00:00:37.789> into<00:00:38.059> that<00:00:38.180> funnel

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
is how to get yourself into that funnel

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.700 
is how to get yourself into that funnel
and<00:00:39.530> how<00:00:40.280> to<00:00:40.340> fly<00:00:40.609> sideways<00:00:40.940> and<00:00:41.510> that<00:00:41.710> Kida

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
and how to fly sideways and that Kida

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.369 
and how to fly sideways and that Kida
sideways<00:00:43.129> flight<00:00:43.489> is<00:00:43.789> in<00:00:44.199> your<00:00:45.199> normal

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
sideways flight is in your normal

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:46.869 
sideways flight is in your normal
circles<00:00:45.949> you're<00:00:46.129> kind<00:00:46.460> of<00:00:46.519> using<00:00:46.789> the

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
circles you're kind of using the

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:47.700 
circles you're kind of using the
elevator

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
elevator

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.950 
elevator
forward<00:00:48.710> and<00:00:48.859> back<00:00:49.550> movement<00:00:50.149> to<00:00:50.539> keep<00:00:50.750> the

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
forward and back movement to keep the

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.720 
forward and back movement to keep the
heli<00:00:51.140> in<00:00:51.379> the<00:00:51.559> circle<00:00:51.949> and<00:00:52.100> you're<00:00:52.250> using<00:00:52.460> the

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
heli in the circle and you're using the

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.419 
heli in the circle and you're using the
tail<00:00:53.000> to<00:00:53.989> kind<00:00:54.199> of<00:00:54.260> you<00:00:54.769> know<00:00:54.800> keep<00:00:55.070> the<00:00:55.190> tail

00:00:55.419 --> 00:00:55.429 
tail to kind of you know keep the tail

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:58.509 
tail to kind of you know keep the tail
in<00:00:55.640> in<00:00:55.940> the<00:00:56.030> turn<00:00:56.269> and<00:00:56.710> you<00:00:57.710> use<00:00:57.890> this<00:00:58.100> cyclic

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
in in the turn and you use this cyclic

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:00.610 
in in the turn and you use this cyclic
to<00:00:58.699> kind<00:00:58.910> of<00:00:58.999> Bank<00:00:59.269> the<00:00:59.480> circle<00:00:59.899> so<00:01:00.379> that<00:01:00.410> you

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
to kind of Bank the circle so that you

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.229 
to kind of Bank the circle so that you
can<00:01:00.769> keep<00:01:00.920> it<00:01:01.070> at<00:01:01.160> a<00:01:01.249> constant<00:01:01.640> height<00:01:01.820> and

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
can keep it at a constant height and

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.570 
can keep it at a constant height and
heading<00:01:02.600> along<00:01:02.839> with<00:01:02.989> the<00:01:03.079> pitch<00:01:03.289> well<00:01:03.589> things

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
heading along with the pitch well things

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.130 
heading along with the pitch well things
are<00:01:04.730> a<00:01:04.790> little<00:01:04.850> bit<00:01:05.030> different<00:01:05.330> in<00:01:05.720> a<00:01:05.840> funnel

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
are a little bit different in a funnel

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.910 
are a little bit different in a funnel
and<00:01:06.950> a<00:01:07.130> funnel<00:01:08.080> you're<00:01:09.080> using<00:01:09.290> the<00:01:09.500> elevator

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
and a funnel you're using the elevator

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.470 
and a funnel you're using the elevator
to<00:01:10.490> hold<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:12.190> helicopter<00:01:13.190> in<00:01:13.370> the<00:01:13.430> funnel<00:01:13.910> and

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:14.480 
to hold the helicopter in the funnel and

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.210 
to hold the helicopter in the funnel and
you're<00:01:14.660> using<00:01:14.870> the<00:01:15.080> cyclic<00:01:15.560> to<00:01:15.710> kind<00:01:15.920> of<00:01:15.980> pull

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
you're using the cyclic to kind of pull

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.200 
you're using the cyclic to kind of pull
it<00:01:16.340> around

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
it around

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.840 
it around
kinda<00:01:17.840> let<00:01:17.930> me<00:01:18.049> do<00:01:18.200> the<00:01:18.350> elevator<00:01:18.620> in<00:01:19.280> a<00:01:19.430> circle

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
kinda let me do the elevator in a circle

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.899 
kinda let me do the elevator in a circle
and<00:01:20.510> as<00:01:21.049> result<00:01:21.290> it<00:01:21.710> requires<00:01:22.159> a<00:01:22.610> little<00:01:22.760> bit

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
and as result it requires a little bit

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.240 
and as result it requires a little bit
more<00:01:23.000> learning<00:01:23.390> a<00:01:23.990> little<00:01:24.500> bit<00:01:24.590> more<00:01:24.710> practice

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
more learning a little bit more practice

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.560 
more learning a little bit more practice
it's<00:01:25.460> not<00:01:25.580> something<00:01:26.240> that<00:01:26.390> you're

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
it's not something that you're

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.600 
it's not something that you're
accustomed<00:01:27.229> to<00:01:27.500> seeing<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:27.830> helicopter<00:01:28.010> do

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
accustomed to seeing the helicopter do

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.899 
accustomed to seeing the helicopter do
which<00:01:28.850> is<00:01:28.970> fly<00:01:29.180> sideways<00:01:29.510> so<00:01:30.759> funnels<00:01:31.759> can

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
which is fly sideways so funnels can

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:33.190 
which is fly sideways so funnels can
look<00:01:32.060> really<00:01:32.360> cool<00:01:32.540> when<00:01:32.750> you<00:01:32.840> do<00:01:32.960> them<00:01:33.080> at<00:01:33.170> the

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
look really cool when you do them at the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.260 
look really cool when you do them at the
field<00:01:33.530> they<00:01:34.520> take<00:01:34.700> a<00:01:34.729> little<00:01:34.970> bit<00:01:35.119> more

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
field they take a little bit more

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.670 
field they take a little bit more
practice<00:01:35.869> because<00:01:36.110> it's<00:01:36.320> a<00:01:36.409> little<00:01:36.530> bit

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
practice because it's a little bit

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.980 
practice because it's a little bit
easier<00:01:37.100> to<00:01:37.159> get<00:01:37.399> disoriented<00:01:38.030> in<00:01:38.450> a<00:01:38.690> funnel

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
easier to get disoriented in a funnel

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.570 
easier to get disoriented in a funnel
and<00:01:39.320> kind<00:01:40.159> of<00:01:40.220> lose<00:01:40.460> it<00:01:41.560> you<00:01:42.560> know<00:01:42.619> I<00:01:42.979> didn't

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
and kind of lose it you know I didn't

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.510 
and kind of lose it you know I didn't
some<00:01:43.820> of<00:01:43.850> these<00:01:43.970> up<00:01:44.180> right<00:01:44.390> where<00:01:44.750> you<00:01:45.520> start

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
some of these up right where you start

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.790 
some of these up right where you start
to<00:01:46.550> gain<00:01:46.790> altitude<00:01:46.970> or<00:01:47.750> the<00:01:47.869> tail<00:01:48.110> starts<00:01:48.619> to

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
to gain altitude or the tail starts to

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.740 
to gain altitude or the tail starts to
fall<00:01:49.009> off<00:01:49.250> then<00:01:49.700> you<00:01:50.240> know<00:01:50.360> that<00:01:50.539> that's

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
fall off then you know that that's

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.080 
fall off then you know that that's
something<00:01:50.960> to<00:01:51.200> work<00:01:51.380> on<00:01:51.670> and<00:01:52.670> when<00:01:52.789> you<00:01:52.820> first

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
something to work on and when you first

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.940 
something to work on and when you first
start<00:01:53.390> doing<00:01:53.720> this<00:01:53.869> you<00:01:54.560> want<00:01:54.710> to<00:01:54.770> make<00:01:54.920> sure

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
start doing this you want to make sure

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.700 
start doing this you want to make sure
that<00:01:55.460> you<00:01:56.210> keep<00:01:56.509> working<00:01:56.720> on<00:01:57.020> these<00:01:57.200> and<00:01:57.500> just

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
that you keep working on these and just

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.760 
that you keep working on these and just
keep<00:01:57.860> working<00:01:58.220> on<00:01:58.310> trying<00:01:58.670> to<00:01:58.880> get<00:01:59.000> around

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
keep working on trying to get around

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.350 
keep working on trying to get around
until<00:02:00.770> you<00:02:00.890> can<00:02:01.070> get<00:02:01.220> all<00:02:01.369> the<00:02:01.520> way<00:02:01.640> and<00:02:02.000> then

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
until you can get all the way and then

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.380 
until you can get all the way and then
once<00:02:02.840> you<00:02:02.960> can<00:02:03.110> get<00:02:03.289> it<00:02:03.380> all<00:02:03.500> the<00:02:03.619> way<00:02:03.710> around

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
once you can get it all the way around

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.540 
once you can get it all the way around
I'm<00:02:05.390> getting<00:02:05.660> it<00:02:05.750> twice<00:02:06.080> and<00:02:06.590> three<00:02:06.920> times<00:02:06.950> and

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
I'm getting it twice and three times and

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:15.690 
I'm getting it twice and three times and
four<00:02:07.729> times<00:02:07.759> and<00:02:08.479> five<00:02:08.720> times

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.480 

why<00:02:16.240> shouldn't<00:02:16.480> that<00:02:16.569> go<00:02:16.870> and<00:02:17.069> start<00:02:18.069> working

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
why shouldn't that go and start working

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.000 
why shouldn't that go and start working
on<00:02:18.810> trying<00:02:19.810> to<00:02:19.900> keep<00:02:20.050> it<00:02:20.230> at<00:02:20.319> a<00:02:20.380> constant<00:02:20.410> speed

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
on trying to keep it at a constant speed

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.140 
on trying to keep it at a constant speed
constant<00:02:21.690> headed<00:02:23.400> right<00:02:24.400> here<00:02:24.670> just<00:02:25.000> wanna

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
constant headed right here just wanna

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.860 
constant headed right here just wanna
keep<00:02:28.920> that<00:02:29.920> circle<00:02:30.430> and<00:02:30.610> just<00:02:31.540> make<00:02:31.720> sure<00:02:31.840> that

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
keep that circle and just make sure that

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.410 
keep that circle and just make sure that
you<00:02:32.080> keep<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.440> tail<00:02:32.760> in<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.970> turning<00:02:34.300> the

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
you keep the tail in the turning the

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.330 
you keep the tail in the turning the
entire<00:02:34.720> time<00:02:35.080> like<00:02:35.110> while<00:02:35.860> you're<00:02:35.980> doing<00:02:36.310> your

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
entire time like while you're doing your

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.660 
entire time like while you're doing your
funnel<00:02:36.820> and<00:02:37.860> there's<00:02:38.860> always<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.250> circles

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
funnel and there's always the circles

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:40.830 
funnel and there's always the circles
and<00:02:39.820> figure<00:02:40.060> Eight's<00:02:40.180> you<00:02:40.420> want<00:02:40.540> to<00:02:40.600> make<00:02:40.720> sure

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
and figure Eight's you want to make sure

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.350 
and figure Eight's you want to make sure
you<00:02:40.990> practice<00:02:41.230> your<00:02:41.590> pail<00:02:41.830> outs<00:02:42.070> and<00:02:42.489> anywhere

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
you practice your pail outs and anywhere

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.940 
you practice your pail outs and anywhere
you<00:02:43.600> go<00:02:45.450> you'll<00:02:46.450> start<00:02:46.690> to<00:02:46.780> notice<00:02:46.989> in<00:02:47.470> doing

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
you go you'll start to notice in doing

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.320 
you go you'll start to notice in doing
funnels<00:02:48.340> that<00:02:48.610> they'll<00:02:48.790> be<00:02:48.910> a<00:02:48.940> certain

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
funnels that they'll be a certain

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.260 
funnels that they'll be a certain
direction<00:02:49.570> even<00:02:50.170> more<00:02:50.620> comfortable<00:02:51.270> within

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
direction even more comfortable within

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.600 
direction even more comfortable within
that<00:02:52.390> tail<00:02:52.630> and<00:02:52.959> it's<00:02:53.050> either<00:02:53.350> pulling<00:02:54.220> a<00:02:54.400> tail

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
that tail and it's either pulling a tail

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.290 
that tail and it's either pulling a tail
or<00:02:55.000> pushing<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.900> tail<00:02:56.140> and<00:02:57.060> that'll<00:02:58.060> kind<00:02:58.239> of

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
or pushing the tail and that'll kind of

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.170 
or pushing the tail and that'll kind of
trend<00:02:58.660> out<00:02:59.250> and<00:03:00.250> some<00:03:00.459> of<00:03:00.550> the<00:03:00.640> things<00:03:00.880> that<00:03:01.090> we

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
trend out and some of the things that we

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.840 
trend out and some of the things that we
do<00:03:01.390> especially<00:03:02.200> morning<00:03:02.920> transitions<00:03:03.640> and

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
do especially morning transitions and

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.060 
do especially morning transitions and
stuff<00:03:04.030> you'll<00:03:04.239> find<00:03:04.510> that<00:03:04.690> one<00:03:05.440> direction<00:03:05.680> and

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
stuff you'll find that one direction and

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.150 
stuff you'll find that one direction and
a<00:03:06.160> tail<00:03:06.400> one<00:03:07.500> direction<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:08.590> circle<00:03:09.010> will<00:03:09.130> be

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
a tail one direction the circle will be

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.190 
a tail one direction the circle will be
easier<00:03:09.760> than<00:03:09.970> another<00:03:10.300> and<00:03:10.630> well<00:03:11.019> it's<00:03:11.110> pretty

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
easier than another and well it's pretty

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.930 
easier than another and well it's pretty
much<00:03:11.410> it<00:03:11.680> you<00:03:12.130> just<00:03:12.280> want<00:03:12.430> to<00:03:12.459> make<00:03:12.580> sure<00:03:12.610> that

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
much it you just want to make sure that

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.699 
much it you just want to make sure that
you<00:03:13.030> practice<00:03:13.540> use<00:03:13.900> different<00:03:14.350> heights<00:03:14.560> a

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
you practice use different heights a

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.920 
you practice use different heights a
little<00:03:14.890> bit<00:03:14.980> higher<00:03:15.190> like<00:03:15.430> I'm<00:03:15.670> here<00:03:16.030> little

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
little bit higher like I'm here little

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.820 
little bit higher like I'm here little
bit<00:03:17.019> lower<00:03:17.230> when<00:03:18.070> you<00:03:18.160> do<00:03:18.310> these<00:03:18.400> you

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
bit lower when you do these you

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.160 
bit lower when you do these you
you<00:03:20.010> know<00:03:20.100> three<00:03:20.340> mistakes<00:03:20.670> eyes<00:03:20.940> so<00:03:21.360> that<00:03:21.540> if

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
you know three mistakes eyes so that if

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.200 
you know three mistakes eyes so that if
something<00:03:22.590> goes<00:03:22.620> wrong<00:03:23.040> you're<00:03:23.700> ready<00:03:23.940> for

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
something goes wrong you're ready for

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.690 
something goes wrong you're ready for
and<00:03:24.780> as<00:03:25.110> make<00:03:25.590> sure<00:03:25.620> you<00:03:25.800> practice<00:03:25.980> some<00:03:26.400> help

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
and as make sure you practice some help

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.400 
and as make sure you practice some help
I<00:03:26.880> as<00:03:27.120> well<00:03:29.180> and<00:03:30.180> for<00:03:30.330> some<00:03:30.510> bonus<00:03:30.660> moves<00:03:31.140> we're

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
I as well and for some bonus moves we're

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.050 
I as well and for some bonus moves we're
going<00:03:31.530> to<00:03:31.590> work<00:03:31.710> on<00:03:31.890> some<00:03:32.190> funnel<00:03:32.460> finger<00:03:32.880> aids

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
going to work on some funnel finger aids

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.050 
going to work on some funnel finger aids
and<00:03:34.040> it's<00:03:35.040> a<00:03:35.130> transition<00:03:35.670> we're<00:03:35.790> gonna<00:03:35.910> work

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
and it's a transition we're gonna work

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.640 
and it's a transition we're gonna work
out<00:03:36.180> a<00:03:36.210> lot<00:03:36.450> more<00:03:36.690> and<00:03:36.750> pretty<00:03:37.020> extensively

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
out a lot more and pretty extensively

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.470 
out a lot more and pretty extensively
and<00:03:38.040> getting<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.400> more<00:03:38.610> food<00:03:38.790> transitions

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
and getting the more food transitions

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.930 
and getting the more food transitions
but<00:03:39.810> you<00:03:40.530> can<00:03:40.620> kind<00:03:40.800> of<00:03:40.860> see<00:03:41.070> here<00:03:41.280> basically

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
but you can kind of see here basically

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.520 
but you can kind of see here basically
what<00:03:42.120> you're<00:03:42.240> doing<00:03:42.270> is<00:03:42.660> once<00:03:43.200> you<00:03:43.320> really

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
what you're doing is once you really

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.890 
what you're doing is once you really
groove<00:03:43.830> in<00:03:43.980> those<00:03:44.190> funnels<00:03:44.640> you<00:03:45.510> can<00:03:45.660> kind<00:03:45.870> of

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
groove in those funnels you can kind of

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.260 
groove in those funnels you can kind of
just<00:03:45.960> pull<00:03:46.380> back<00:03:46.410> an<00:03:46.830> elevator<00:03:47.340> and<00:03:47.700> then<00:03:47.970> you

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
just pull back an elevator and then you

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.120 
just pull back an elevator and then you
want<00:03:48.420> to<00:03:48.480> snap<00:03:48.840> it<00:03:49.050> back<00:03:49.230> into<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.740> other<00:03:49.860> side

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
want to snap it back into the other side

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.460 
want to snap it back into the other side
of<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.340> funnel<00:03:50.700> and<00:03:50.850> keep<00:03:51.030> going<00:03:51.360> around<00:03:51.510> this

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
of the funnel and keep going around this

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.020 
of the funnel and keep going around this
gives<00:03:52.740> a<00:03:52.830> really<00:03:53.130> good<00:03:53.280> effect<00:03:53.700> when<00:03:53.940> you're

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
gives a really good effect when you're

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.180 
gives a really good effect when you're
at<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.240> field<00:03:54.540> and<00:03:55.020> it's<00:03:55.230> pretty<00:03:55.860> exciting

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
at the field and it's pretty exciting

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:05.780 
at the field and it's pretty exciting
maneuver<00:03:56.760> to<00:03:56.850> watch

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.100 

and<00:04:06.330> here<00:04:06.480> we're<00:04:06.569> going<00:04:06.599> to<00:04:06.750> do<00:04:06.870> just

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
and here we're going to do just

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.530 
and here we're going to do just
basically<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:07.709> same<00:04:07.950> type<00:04:08.700> of<00:04:08.760> move<00:04:09.090> but

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
basically the same type of move but

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.110 
basically the same type of move but
we're<00:04:09.689> gonna<00:04:09.780> do<00:04:09.959> it<00:04:09.989> with<00:04:10.200> the<00:04:10.290> nose<00:04:10.470> down

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
we're gonna do it with the nose down

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.809 
we're gonna do it with the nose down
funnel

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:16.909 

if<00:04:15.390> you<00:04:15.480> want<00:04:15.659> so<00:04:15.750> you<00:04:15.780> can<00:04:16.019> slow<00:04:16.229> it<00:04:16.260> down<00:04:16.440> you

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
if you want so you can slow it down you

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.979 
if you want so you can slow it down you
can<00:04:17.100> you<00:04:17.400> can<00:04:17.579> change<00:04:17.940> up<00:04:18.269> how<00:04:18.600> you<00:04:18.660> do<00:04:18.870> the

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
can you can change up how you do the

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.180 
can you can change up how you do the
transition<00:04:20.720> and<00:04:21.720> I<00:04:22.350> just<00:04:22.620> kind<00:04:22.830> of<00:04:22.860> have<00:04:22.979> some

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
transition and I just kind of have some

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.520 
transition and I just kind of have some
fun<00:04:23.400> with<00:04:23.580> it<00:04:23.610> and<00:04:24.139> let<00:04:25.139> it<00:04:25.169> get<00:04:25.380> in<00:04:25.440> the<00:04:25.500> way

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
fun with it and let it get in the way

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.280 
fun with it and let it get in the way
you<00:04:25.680> want<00:04:25.860> to<00:04:25.919> make<00:04:26.430> it<00:04:26.550> fast<00:04:26.820> commit<00:04:27.510> Wow

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
you want to make it fast commit Wow

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
and we can make a shower and and we'll

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.040 
and we can make a shower and and we'll
work<00:04:31.169> on<00:04:31.350> that<00:04:31.380> pretty<00:04:31.770> extensively<00:04:32.660> in<00:04:33.660> the

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
work on that pretty extensively in the

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.760 
work on that pretty extensively in the
next<00:04:34.289> couple<00:04:34.560> of<00:04:34.590> videos<00:04:36.440> there<00:04:37.440> you<00:04:37.560> go

next couple of videos there you go
there's<00:04:38.220> some<00:04:38.510> morphing<00:04:39.510> formulas<00:04:40.199> and

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
there's some morphing formulas and
