 in case I died but anyway 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.180
 is basically popular and when people 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.520
 born is taught that this clone is this 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.710

 victim here in case I'm going to try to follow 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.479
 the red ones because that's what 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.520
 They told me to try to score more 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.200

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.090
 far away, look, just play here far. 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.710
 threw away 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.119
 anderson followed the reds that are 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.490
 better for people here than us 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.710
 to fit a diamond and we have to 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.780
 Click on the diamond block on it 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.430
 You will be able to is winning 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.079
 game mode in case of that diamond 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.159
 he gal that we have to play 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.990
 let me see here do not fall do not see if the 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.210
 people play and we win a game more 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.420
 I want to talk, you always follow red. 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:04.229
 It's always going to be a good thing, I skipped it. 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.659
 and jumped opus gay 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.660
 I won this is the game mode and who 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.430
 you have more points wins, it's a lot 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.840
 even at the time I really enjoyed that 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.710
 game mode you can see that here 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.230
 down 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.090
 It's time then there's time for us 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.150
 take it all when the time is up 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.280
 to complete the phase and phase change model 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.260
 map indeed I can not on that side 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.240
 otherwise they'll keep dying, guys. 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.950
 I really wanted to show you why 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.990
 play on a map that I do not know is a 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.940
 little more complicated than one does not know 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.260
 As I 'm recording I wanted to show 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.900
 one thing i know 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.790
 case is the map that occurred with the 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.530
 I play more even when I'm going to shower face 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.570
 always earn some things here in chat 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.310
 and the three point gain in one afternoon is 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.500
 something I always win but anyway 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.090
 had a map that I know is the 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.180
 map because I really like this evil I 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.890
 I think if I had to, god, why? 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.300
 the following I 'll explain basically 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.140
 when I explained a lot about the 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.930
 Serbian nÃ© 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.660
 but I took and divulged and it serves because 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.180
 I really wanted you to see this 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.940
 kind of game is just about the right time and I did not see 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.220
 type game people still making videos 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.500
 so here and forever I am winning 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.270
 money is killing some people 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:17.430
 in the case that killed that person 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:20.060
 Here I have it, man, what is it? 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.670
 I do not even know where I do not know this map. 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.870
 ayale look i put my car passed 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:33.000
 in front of us like I'm an idiot mother 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:36.000
 our old knows mano see that in 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.710
 got caught understood it was to understand 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.270
 But there it is, I 'm right here. 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:42.330
 announcing that I've never seen that serve 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.310
 nowhere to hang it's cool but bora 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.200
 there galera hang 300 thousand times here back 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.420
 continued reasoning here was 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.760
 basically the following I've never seen serves 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.170
 like this year mainly in video and 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.370
 There are some guys knocking over here. 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.250
 it will end up chipping that I already 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.410
 I killed more beauty here, I never saw people. 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.510
 doing this kind of stuff 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.150
 I wish I could bring some videos here. 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.920
 You serve yourself here and I think it's fine. 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.660
 cool kind of series that they wanted 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.830
 provide for people who play 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.110
 tomorrow, craft 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.360
 and it's very different to you and 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.190
 someone has put his hand there is the diamond 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.600
 because you know what kind of me 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.239
 I have to find some diamond 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.100
 from this block of ours to the death box 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.720
 to block further within that bug 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.820
 lovers to earn points and win 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.770
 Anything, I confess, I do not know what to do. 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.970
 It serves these points but I know it's fine. 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.160
 fun the same thing 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.480
 what types and has the win type does not serve 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.490
 Nothing to win, just to say that 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.640
 You have the type of victory, you're connected. 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.870
 and here we go and we'll continue here and 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.700
 I want to show here I know it's 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.460
 basically where the diamond is now 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.930
 and even for the first time I played 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.410
 the first time the game is this map 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.780
 and some guys here are already going to need 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.880
 so that he falls that same guy dies 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.340
 from the beginning can not be that better guy 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.670
 that I maintain has pilot people who killed 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:59.340
 yesterday 17 down here and let's see if there 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.890
 I fell did not tighten even though I 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.530
 I died but at last you can see that I 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:07.770
 When I go on the case, let's go. 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.120
 postpone good guys and I earn point 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.100
 for knocking people down 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.150
 in case you try to overturn the 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.450
 people here 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:18.570
 GOT 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.980
 let's try to go for the third time 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.770
 I do not know how many times I'm here more 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.240
 although I really enjoyed myself there 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.820
 use brought live 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.500
 There you asked for video about this thing. 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.470
 that the guy is afraid of falling harder 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:34.410
 there are going to bring down here out of here face 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.270
 Serious akman go ahead and hopefully 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.040
 have no one behind in the intention 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.230
 people go ahead faster than he 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.900
 but beauty and argued a lot and if it serves 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.340
