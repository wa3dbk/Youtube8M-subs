so<00:01:33.360> there's<00:01:33.509> one<00:01:33.659> screw<00:01:33.900> here<00:01:34.079> we<00:01:34.200> have<00:01:34.350> to

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
so there's one screw here we have to

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.010 
so there's one screw here we have to
undo<00:01:35.090> those<00:01:36.090> little<00:01:36.270> connector<00:01:36.600> here<00:01:36.750> for<00:01:36.930> the

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
undo those little connector here for the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.539 
undo those little connector here for the
lights<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.680> light<00:01:37.829> up<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.220> where<00:01:38.430> eyes

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
lights that light up to and where eyes

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.640 
lights that light up to and where eyes
on<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.790> side<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.720> there's<00:01:39.900> actually<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.380> video

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
on the side so there's actually a video

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.380 
on the side so there's actually a video
of<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.280> whole<00:01:41.460> process<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:42.060> disassembling

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
of the whole process of disassembling

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.090 
of the whole process of disassembling
the<00:01:42.780> system<00:01:43.140> already<00:01:43.380> we<00:01:43.590> encourage<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.070> to

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
the system already we encourage you to

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.830 
the system already we encourage you to
take<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.369> look<00:01:44.549> at<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.759> review<00:01:45.119> where<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.689> can

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
take a look at the review where you can

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.899 
take a look at the review where you can
see<00:01:46.020> us<00:01:46.140> do<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.500> this<00:01:46.950> daughter<00:01:47.310> card<00:01:47.640> here

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
see us do that this daughter card here

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.060 
see us do that this daughter card here
goes<00:01:48.450> from<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.750> graphics<00:01:49.140> card<00:01:49.350> down<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.950> the

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
goes from the graphics card down to the

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.770 
goes from the graphics card down to the
motherboard<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:50.729> that<00:01:50.880> bridge<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.420> PCI

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
motherboard so that bridge is the PCI

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.630 
motherboard so that bridge is the PCI
expansion<00:01:52.170> slot<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.770> that's<00:01:52.890> how<00:01:53.130> only<00:01:53.490> where

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
expansion slot and that's how only where

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.609 
expansion slot and that's how only where
it<00:01:53.670> can<00:01:53.820> do<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.149> graphics<00:01:54.600> card<00:01:54.630> full<00:01:55.409> height

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
it can do this graphics card full height

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.249 
it can do this graphics card full height
going<00:01:56.100> along<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.399> side<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.759> PC<00:01:57.259> otherwise

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
going along the side of the PC otherwise

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.690 
going along the side of the PC otherwise
it's<00:01:58.500> pretty<00:01:58.619> straightforward<00:01:58.979> there's<00:01:59.610> a

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
it's pretty straightforward there's a

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.219 
it's pretty straightforward there's a
mechanical<00:02:00.090> hard<00:02:00.479> drive<00:02:00.689> underneath<00:02:01.140> the

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
mechanical hard drive underneath the

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.770 
mechanical hard drive underneath the
graphics<00:02:01.590> card<00:02:01.890> we've<00:02:02.759> got<00:02:02.909> memory<00:02:03.270> down<00:02:03.450> here

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
graphics card we've got memory down here

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.719 
graphics card we've got memory down here
and<00:02:03.990> here's<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.500> optical<00:02:04.890> drive<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.310> CPU<00:02:05.700> of

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
and here's the optical drive the CPU of

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.190 
and here's the optical drive the CPU of
course<00:02:05.969> is<00:02:06.149> underneath<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.570> fan<00:02:06.750> right<00:02:06.899> here

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
course is underneath the fan right here

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.139 
course is underneath the fan right here
so<00:02:08.099> in<00:02:08.160> our<00:02:08.250> testing<00:02:08.610> we<00:02:08.640> found<00:02:08.879> this<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.119> a

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
so in our testing we found this is a

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.999 
so in our testing we found this is a
pretty<00:02:09.360> decent<00:02:09.599> gaming<00:02:10.080> PC<00:02:10.410> at<00:02:10.619> least<00:02:10.770> for<00:02:10.890> its

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
pretty decent gaming PC at least for its

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.699 
pretty decent gaming PC at least for its
price<00:02:11.250> it'll<00:02:12.030> play<00:02:12.209> battlefield<00:02:12.690> 3<00:02:12.900> at<00:02:13.020> 19

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
price it'll play battlefield 3 at 19

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.619 
price it'll play battlefield 3 at 19
with<00:02:13.920> high<00:02:14.069> detail<00:02:14.459> and<00:02:14.670> pretty<00:02:15.150> good<00:02:15.329> speed

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
with high detail and pretty good speed

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.179 
with high detail and pretty good speed
there's<00:02:15.930> no<00:02:16.019> real<00:02:16.200> slowdowns<00:02:16.890> that<00:02:17.099> we

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:17.189 
there's no real slowdowns that we

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:18.949 
there's no real slowdowns that we
noticed<00:02:17.549> overall<00:02:18.390> it's<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.540> pretty<00:02:18.569> solid

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
noticed overall it's a pretty solid

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.199 
noticed overall it's a pretty solid
gaming<00:02:19.379> system<00:02:19.739> that<00:02:20.489> said<00:02:20.730> it's<00:02:20.849> CPU

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
gaming system that said it's CPU

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.789 
gaming system that said it's CPU
performance<00:02:21.689> wasn't<00:02:21.870> that<00:02:22.049> great<00:02:22.409> if<00:02:22.620> you

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
performance wasn't that great if you

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:23.899 
performance wasn't that great if you
want<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.010> spend<00:02:23.189> a<00:02:23.219> little<00:02:23.310> bit<00:02:23.459> more<00:02:23.549> you<00:02:23.790> can

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
want to spend a little bit more you can

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:25.699 
want to spend a little bit more you can
upgrade<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.329> a<00:02:24.359> core<00:02:24.599> i7<00:02:24.750> chip<00:02:25.319> so<00:02:25.469> that's<00:02:25.620> a

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
upgrade to a core i7 chip so that's a

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:26.390 
upgrade to a core i7 chip so that's a
nice<00:02:25.859> option

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
nice option

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.179 
nice option
now<00:02:26.969> this<00:02:27.120> x51<00:02:27.689> does<00:02:27.930> have<00:02:28.109> a<00:02:28.140> 330<00:02:28.859> watt<00:02:29.010> power

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:29.189 
now this x51 does have a 330 watt power

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:30.589 
now this x51 does have a 330 watt power
supply<00:02:29.549> in<00:02:29.700> here<00:02:29.819> which<00:02:29.969> lets<00:02:30.180> it<00:02:30.359> use<00:02:30.480> the

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
supply in here which lets it use the

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.449 
supply in here which lets it use the
faster<00:02:30.959> graphics<00:02:31.139> card<00:02:31.560> but<00:02:32.099> it<00:02:32.189> probably

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
faster graphics card but it probably

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:33.920 
faster graphics card but it probably
can't<00:02:32.639> use<00:02:32.790> a<00:02:32.819> much<00:02:33.030> faster<00:02:33.269> card<00:02:33.599> than<00:02:33.750> that

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
can't use a much faster card than that

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.149 
can't use a much faster card than that
which<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.290> can<00:02:34.439> certainly<00:02:34.650> get<00:02:34.980> in<00:02:35.099> a

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159 
which you can certainly get in a
