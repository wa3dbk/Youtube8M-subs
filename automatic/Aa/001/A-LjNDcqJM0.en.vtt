00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.490
 our world is so i was an object 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.740
 adhere 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.320
 which in turn can carry information 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.060
 can also convey information 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.800
 We always want to put in the foreground 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.070
 again with all the work we do 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.530
 The object itself tells us something 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.790
 not important the computer of the computer 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.879
 can not even tell 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.050
 in this sense, we are trying 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.320
 technology does not disappear 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.320
 to show 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.570
 we are here today at wittenbergplatz 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.850
 in berlin schoeneberg and i am kicking 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.680
 same with joachim sauter international 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.410
 prizewinner of the media designers and 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.410
 reasons of the design agency art is coming 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.860
 So we are here at the deal I have 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:16.160
 that with other colleagues 21 years ago 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.160
 founded and used directly 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.439
 88 due to the fact that it stops 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.049
 gave these new digital technologies 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.130
 the state and our interest was as 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.659
 we realized that not only one 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.920
 tool aware of a medium with whom you 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.450
 can communicate 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.140
 we felt that something was coming 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.690
 and that was our interest 90 what 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.979
 that's what it's all about 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.080
 There were kindergarten taken in the basics 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.479
 we worked it out we tried 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.100
 to put building blocks on each other and 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.350
 then slowly grew up 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:54.450
 with it and the medium is with us too 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:56.729
 Today we are one grown up 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.740
 group trying as we did then 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.450
 started with new media too 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.780
 communicate and that sometimes very much 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.429
 experimental installations sometimes 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.319
 with interactive roles sometimes too 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.630
 interactive architectural tours and the 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:11.430
 drives us others I believe we do 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.819
 also in their very special way and 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.819
 wise 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.430
 just realized 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:25.430
 the new bmw museum in munich is very 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.040
 nice tasks and indeed design process 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.599
 represent a vehicle 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.819
 it usually makes me feel like that 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:34.040
 talking heads monitor shows old this 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.590
 one of them I made that way 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.180
 made as I said nee let us that very much 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:43.010
 exciting and he metaphorically tell 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.989
 the beginning is a first show there 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.330
 has no ideas these contribute 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.190
 then we start the first abstract 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.099
 forms to develop so is also a 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.590
 designer makes and then it goes on in 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:57.380
 the competition before the july oil 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.209
 again with others to finish 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.750
 then stop that the finished 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.750
 vehicles 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.110
 15 20 years and the virtual moves 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.600
 So the people are very isolated from the 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.890
 have sat down 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.600
 information also sought entertainment 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.790
 we are looking for incredible things again 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.200
 need to go outside no more 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.360
 but to sit in front of the computer alone 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.880
 with the real world and there is the 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:33.880
 renaissance of having properly physical 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:35.950
 objectively natural ecological 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.810
 big challenge with bite 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.030
 to work on the screen where you are 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.920
 can make time for free the relatively 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:46.810
 works easily with object in the room 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.910
 mechatronic objects are already working 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.910
 very certified 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.170
 sound was a very important project 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.440
 wants to play 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.720
 for the opera the jew of malta i have 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.450
 In 1999 a composer was called 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.560
 about the order you get grandpa 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.860
 compose 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.020
 we then have the same process as the process 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.959
 composing in the ideal stage setting 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.850
 one developed in the piece are 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:20.400
 main actor reichsmark used 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:22.250
 and he has power over the stages 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.050
 where he stands as he moves 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.060
 camera technology system develops therefore 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.490
 exactly this movement allows him to 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.990
 transfer 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.400
 We tried new actions 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:38.550
 quality must be brought to the stage 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:40.530
 the stage itself wants to become a character 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.760
 had to be an artist in the 80s 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.729
 and designers we needed 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.500
 Program pathologists together summer 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:48.560
 It's still like that today 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.580
 and I believe without them 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.700
 conflict between art 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.620
 design technology and and 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.000
 Programming will not be ours 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.280
 we do not give or would not be relevant 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.010
 is totally amazing how 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.160
 nowadays students with technology 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:08.400
 deal with what insolence with 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.830
 which one is losigkeit it is like that 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.320
 become extremely normal and so this 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:17.060
 openness allows just the very 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.060
 ordinary projects arise
