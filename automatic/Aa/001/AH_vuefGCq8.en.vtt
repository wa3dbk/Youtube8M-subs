00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 Talking galley on channel on skateboard 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.170
 Who speaks guilherme ab 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:12.090
 today I'll give tips to run the 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:14.009
 then Greek government was first 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.849
 there is cruch is that maneuver when 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.640
 you enter 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.590
 on the opposite side of the handrail 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.350
 equal the crux as if entering 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.750
 in the other direction, for example the front 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.390
 side of cross will be equal to backside 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.800
 cross and have a recruited frontside 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.289
 Do you have a good idea of ​​how to get around? 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.750
 the crux that is that control of doing 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.329
 running in the broad sense when he is 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.430
 crooked for you to send the front 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.350
 What are you going to do with lemon? 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.629
 slightly angle does not need to be so 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.040
 parallel because otherwise your body will 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.840
 design on the other hand you will end up 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.090
 Wrong, it's going to be hard. 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.829
 you will fit in that way is so 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.719
 different from the club you fit 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.090
 shape the vehicle as you get on weight 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.039
 a little more centralized with the 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.590
 railing make know a little more 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.510
 high as if it were a new one 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.879
 big crooked in the opposite direction 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.629
 concentrated between that side and singer there 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.339
 get out 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.380
 so I 'll control it accordingly 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.840
 here and the output will be the same as the quilt 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.430
 I'll ease the foot in front of him. 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.530
 do it here and back 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.450
 you can see that you will move on to 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.340
 brother and you will be more or 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.290
 but here you will not be the right 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.390
 positioning of the shipwreck see 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.100
 group can be full time was a 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.979
 time equal to the oil just hit have 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.530
 the front just behind the end of the 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.030
 screws slightly angled when you 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.000
 passes over the brother without doing this 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.619
 movement here work on the flavors 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.540
 having to're close is that it already 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.700
 have come to sit here you fit the 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.009
 Vera Cruz 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.009
 enter the year slightly with the animal 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.440
 the guys are trying the front side 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.390
 vehicle had what else is it that you 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.340
 tries to move to the other side and 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.320
 imagine that you 're running cruch lonely 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.450
 When you enter from crux backside you 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.800
 project your body here and your weight stays 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.360
 playing in that direction then you 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.429
 can press against the railing and 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.720
 there is no cross if you think that 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.070
 Are you going to fit in here is like a 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.110
 Club other hand railing 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.150
 You'll pass here, you 'll fit in. 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.770
 that their weight in that sense and not 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.630
 accordingly as if he had entered the 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.709
 backside clubs you will find here and 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.239
 Are you going to fall for it? 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.470
 So you can not think it's 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.090
 to simply go the other way 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.709
 railing and give a group you will not 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.690
 to be able to do this movement already 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.700
 and force him in that direction not to 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.770
 is how you do it you imagine 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.330
 that 's a new big bang this goes 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.750
 make you drop your weight on 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.160
 top 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.200
 if you are sending you our great 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.280
 is to centralize it here then you think 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.380
 which is a great new 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.910
 Are you going to fit it all in here? 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.620
 You 'll be able to send it that way. 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.810
 with their weight just above the 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.880
 handrail a docked here the tracking 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.130
 year much like what I explained 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.090
 of bragg with lemon color round more 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.160
 easy group 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.330
 it fits into that part that goes 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.459
 lock here 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.459
 and then it's easier to run and go back 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.670
 ah 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:31.560
 Money the drug asking for tips like 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.430
 week the front side the vehicle had its 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.540
 channel over skateboard
