00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.440 
twist and then climb up you know that's
the<00:01:17.230> safest<00:01:17.650> way<00:01:17.770> one<00:01:18.670> time<00:01:18.910> I<00:01:18.940> was<00:01:19.210> climbing

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
the safest way one time I was climbing

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.230 
the safest way one time I was climbing
up<00:01:19.690> and<00:01:19.870> I<00:01:19.900> jumped<00:01:20.410> off<00:01:20.590> incorrectly<00:01:21.340> and<00:01:22.060> my<00:01:22.210> a

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
up and I jumped off incorrectly and my a

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.480 
up and I jumped off incorrectly and my a
speed<00:01:22.720> upon<00:01:22.990> off<00:01:23.230> the<00:01:23.380> left-hand<00:01:23.770> side<00:01:24.070> and<00:01:24.370> I

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
speed upon off the left-hand side and I

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.410 
speed upon off the left-hand side and I
was<00:01:24.640> all<00:01:24.880> she<00:01:25.180> wrote

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
was all she wrote

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.380 
was all she wrote
so<00:01:26.140> the<00:01:26.350> safe<00:01:26.560> bet<00:01:26.860> is<00:01:26.890> to<00:01:27.250> just<00:01:27.520> you<00:01:28.000> know<00:01:28.030> pick

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
so the safe bet is to just you know pick

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.130 
so the safe bet is to just you know pick
your<00:01:28.570> poison

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
your poison

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.080 
your poison
know<00:01:29.590> when<00:01:29.860> you<00:01:29.980> can't<00:01:30.220> go<00:01:30.460> up<00:01:30.610> anymore<00:01:30.910> and

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
know when you can't go up anymore and

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.780 
know when you can't go up anymore and
then<00:01:31.330> Michael<00:01:31.540> Jordan<00:01:32.080> up<00:01:32.230> now<00:01:32.920> essentially

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
then Michael Jordan up now essentially

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.190 
then Michael Jordan up now essentially
when<00:01:33.940> you<00:01:34.030> reach<00:01:34.240> this<00:01:34.420> part<00:01:34.690> you<00:01:34.870> might<00:01:35.050> have

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
when you reach this part you might have

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.140 
when you reach this part you might have
a<00:01:35.230> little<00:01:35.380> trouble<00:01:35.680> like<00:01:35.950> I<00:01:36.160> did<00:01:36.400> but<00:01:36.880> you<00:01:37.000> got

a little trouble like I did but you got

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.210 
a little trouble like I did but you got
to<00:01:37.240> look<00:01:37.330> for<00:01:37.390> the<00:01:37.690> little<00:01:37.840> grooves<00:01:38.650> to<00:01:38.980> hook

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
to look for the little grooves to hook

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.270 
symbols part one so for this particular
mission<00:02:55.360> we<00:02:55.780> need<00:02:55.960> to<00:02:56.110> look<00:02:56.290> over<00:02:56.500> and<00:02:56.860> use<00:02:57.040> our

mission we need to look over and use our

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.880 
mission we need to look over and use our
own<00:02:57.460> little<00:02:57.760> Eagle<00:02:58.180> Eye<00:02:58.360> to<00:02:59.260> pick<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.710> right

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
own little Eagle Eye to pick the right

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.860 
own little Eagle Eye to pick the right
spot<00:03:00.430> and<00:03:00.640> actually<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.210> right<00:03:01.360> spot<00:03:01.630> is<00:03:01.780> the

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
spot and actually the right spot is the

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.650 
spot and actually the right spot is the
middle<00:03:02.110> one<00:03:02.320> so<00:03:02.730> not<00:03:03.730> that<00:03:03.940> once<00:03:04.240> the<00:03:04.450> right

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
middle one so not that once the right

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.470 
middle one so not that once the right
spot<00:03:04.930> for<00:03:04.960> me<00:03:05.260> was<00:03:05.440> that<00:03:05.470> one<00:03:05.920> right<00:03:06.160> there

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
spot for me was that one right there

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.110 
spot for me was that one right there
that's<00:03:07.480> bullseye<00:03:08.140> x<00:03:08.740> marks<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:09.670> spot

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
that's bullseye x marks the spot

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.710 
that's bullseye x marks the spot
center<00:03:10.750> of<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.110> dial<00:03:11.410> so<00:03:11.880> now<00:03:12.880> you<00:03:13.600> could

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
center of the dial so now you could

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.460 
center of the dial so now you could
decide<00:03:14.050> to<00:03:14.190> you<00:03:15.190> know<00:03:15.330> jump<00:03:16.330> off<00:03:16.630> which<00:03:17.230> way

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
decide to you know jump off which way

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.620 
decide to you know jump off which way
you<00:03:17.530> want<00:03:17.890> I<00:03:18.070> decided<00:03:18.490> to<00:03:18.730> jump<00:03:18.940> off<00:03:19.150> from<00:03:19.450> the

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
you want I decided to jump off from the

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.130 
you want I decided to jump off from the
I<00:03:19.840> guess<00:03:20.320> behind<00:03:21.220> from<00:03:21.880> where<00:03:21.910> I'm<00:03:22.150> facing<00:03:22.390> so

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
I guess behind from where I'm facing so

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.810 
I guess behind from where I'm facing so
essentially<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:23.770> front<00:03:24.130> of<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.580> building

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
essentially the front of the building

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.390 
essentially the front of the building
where<00:03:25.150> I<00:03:25.180> climbed<00:03:25.570> up<00:03:25.750> because<00:03:26.560> I<00:03:26.740> knew<00:03:27.070> there

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
where I climbed up because I knew there

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.540 
where I climbed up because I knew there
was<00:03:27.490> a<00:03:27.550> stack<00:03:27.910> of<00:03:27.940> hay<00:03:28.120> waiting<00:03:28.570> for<00:03:28.720> me<00:03:29.550> that's

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
was a stack of hay waiting for me that's
