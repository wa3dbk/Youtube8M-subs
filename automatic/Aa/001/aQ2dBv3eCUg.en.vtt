00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.040
 new member of recruits in the 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.600
 week of the questions but before 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.040
 I want to say that I am very happy 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.100
 be here representing the color 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.489
 yellow and jules is short short is already 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.750
 here is worth my question is why do you think 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.750
 that you deserve the yellow color 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:00.739
 because I am destined to represent 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:02.769
 This color was once told to me by a voice 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.590
 powerful ancestral in a revelation 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:10.970
 now I am a powerful ancestral voice 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:14.520
 talking about a revelation that yes good 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:18.060
 from the color that surrounds you 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.740
 yellow is defined that you are 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.570
 destined to represent the tricolor 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:34.140
 because I play 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:34.140
 and this is yellow 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.500
 the revelation 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.840
 and that happened and I did not just invented 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.630
 no way 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.250
 next question jules what is the 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.240
 maximum number of knives with which 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.240
 you can juggle 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:05.009
 with 0 or welcome recruited thanks 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.530
 here goes my question do you have any 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.220
 addiction I do not have much self-control and I do not 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.720
 I let go of chocolate again and 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.280
 honey but as we have agreed to enter 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.860
 in reputed that what we charge 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.890
 millions is a lie that you were in 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.930
 thinking I do not know, let me fool you 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.720
 those of the two pretty colors the 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.220
 music of the bribes that he said 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.920
 to know is not to govern 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.570
 next question jules what do you think of 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.030
 that the color yellow is the color of 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.100
 bad luck seems to me very badly that 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.050
 is judging justly the yellow 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.970
 because that's just superstitions and what 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.550

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:47.180
 luck to come to the team that comes

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.280
 I have a pet rock called rock and 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.590
 no rock and bad bad stone in that here 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.270

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.280
 comes from the guests of the 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.930
 week in my head is a show if 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.420
 could live in a series which would be 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.420
 I really like the walking dead 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.490

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.050
