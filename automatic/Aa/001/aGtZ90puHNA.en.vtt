00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
although you've got up down left and

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.360 
although you've got up down left and

right arrows you can jump diagonally

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:15.910 
right arrows you can jump diagonally
which<00:02:11.370> is<00:02:11.519> good<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:12.440> guess

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.539 

tombé<00:02:16.920> Mona<00:02:20.510> so<00:02:21.510> does<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.780> best<00:02:21.959> of<00:02:22.109> the<00:02:22.170> best

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
tombé Mona so does the best of the best

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:25.670 
tombé Mona so does the best of the best
that's<00:02:23.549> and<00:02:23.880> it's<00:02:23.970> made<00:02:24.150> perfect<00:02:24.540> sense<00:02:24.680> which

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
that's and it's made perfect sense which

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.680 
that's and it's made perfect sense which
is<00:02:25.739> pretty<00:02:25.980> good<00:02:26.130> for<00:02:26.190> these<00:02:26.609> guys<00:02:26.820> so<00:02:29.690> the

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
is pretty good for these guys so the

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.539 
is pretty good for these guys so the
game<00:02:30.840> kind<00:02:31.019> of<00:02:31.170> stalled<00:02:31.380> out<00:02:31.530> on<00:02:31.560> me<00:02:31.799> I<00:02:32.070> had<00:02:32.459> to

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
game kind of stalled out on me I had to

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.490 
game kind of stalled out on me I had to
restart<00:02:32.760> it<00:02:33.150> in<00:02:33.390> order<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:33.959> actually<00:02:34.109> be<00:02:34.290> able

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
restart it in order to actually be able

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.160
