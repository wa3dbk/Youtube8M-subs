00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.519
 two 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:32.390
 how many bars to couple forces of bars 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.390
 large letters of means 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.660
 anything else 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.940
 We are pretty oils 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.680
 the humans with them 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.570
 you 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:13.250
 the garlic 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.250
 runners a little bit 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.580
 also the basses we will show them the 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.500
 screaming topics we give them a blow and 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:25.020
 tissues we cut for example if everything does not 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.020
 I have been showing lives together 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.920
 we ignore the affects 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.700
 but 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.360
 now let's take his life God has 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.070
 made eye 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.610
 but more or less what tablespoons 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.610
 overcome 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:55.840
 I have to listen to the glued 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:58.440
 it fry garin its under the gallant life 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.440
 fried 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.670
 and wide mobile bread 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.670
 well drained 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:16.130
 let's proceed to throw the bread 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.130
 it's done like that for you ball 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.460
 bread is always better than not 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.940
 village that is normal because the 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:34.390
 people go out more with the music sight 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.390
 the crumbs 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.320
 very pretty 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:49.240
 with everything 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.760
 although of the apparent measure 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.500
 now not to not see men 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.689
 so that when now also when 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.489
 Thursday's stars will place another the same 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:00.489
 I like the same 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.640
 I know I have a dining room 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.360
 we put the salt because he for the 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.720
 hunger is soaking has lost salt 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.720
 I had 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.340
 Now that they are hot and all are well 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.040
 mixed and the crumbs have warmed a 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.250
 little looking for that carol we miss the 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.910
 he fulfilled a handful of life 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.090
 so that they stick before and apart that they 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.710
 they make emitted ones encouraged the board 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.160
 then it contains salts regulate as 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.160
 turns 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.230
 It is as good 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:06.230
 We've been 10 minutes so when 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.230
 when moving moving 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:15.600
 Now nearly half are half what 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:20.360
 what we have to do now that is with 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.360
 a straw is cut turning it over 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:29.370
 and apart it's going to come out of the steam and they're going 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:32.370
 drying before and not now is considered 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.370
 same 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:44.130
 then we stop the arms 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:53.270
 start to take the favor 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.480
 OK 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:59.180
 Well, here I have three minutes left 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:04.639
 that comes out a little bit more but it stops 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:07.099
 is living 23 minutes 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:09.879
 but they continue to worship and are thus between 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:09.879
 two benches 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.220
 no matter 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:26.320
 this was to eat and not open the 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:26.320
 mouth to speak
