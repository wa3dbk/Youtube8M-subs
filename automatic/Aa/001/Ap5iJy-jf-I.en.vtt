00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 Hello everyone, I apologize for the light 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.840
 we are in chicago right now 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:14.700
 it's ten o'clock now 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:18.420
 accordingly, we are a little bit well in it we 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.880
 could not shoot video because as 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.400
 you can sit and shoot video as the day Th 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.910
 You do not understand this, therefore I immediately ask 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.210
 prostration color and for the very reason that 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.160
 I am not in the country right now this video 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.130
 will be different from those that I usually 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.559
 rented and it will be allotted often 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.940
 the questions you ask and I will try 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.430
 to answer them 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.510
 first question is how old I am 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.309
 I am 18 years old in taste does not turn 19 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.670
 the second question is this day i study i 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.930
 I am a student one more students 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.510
 Nazarbayev University 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.780
 because I graduated from foundation a 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.949
 and I do not give exam results 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.590
 accordingly and can't say i am 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.640
 I'm a student , but I believe that 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:09.030
 discussed the replacement because I will 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:11.310
 credited to the Faculty of Economics and then 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.430
 a question that I often get asked 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.890
 This is the question of how Nazarbayev teaches it . 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.600
 university and how I liked on 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.530
 foundation 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.060
 if you do Nazarbayev 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.880
 University you have two options either 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.140
 you go to the foundation or you 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.540
 you enter for 1 course 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.090
 you definitely have three kinds of this physics 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.180
 maths 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.180
 critical thinking 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.670
 if you go to the foundation you have 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.620
 three options 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.820
 physics mathematics economics and 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.460
 international relationships 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.050
 having biology is actually a foundation 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.910
 you don't need if you have 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.340
 fairly high level of English 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:53.470
 if you took the exams and the site and he 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:55.720
 you are above the 1860 ball it is easy to learn if 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.540
 you really learn eat 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.590
 do visit excuses about what it is 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.060
 difficult no time it's all a lie 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.240
 if you really want that 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.790
 you will succeed and will not disturb 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.200
 car or first another question 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.920
 which I very often ask 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.830
 what are we doing what we do 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.959
 Azik is an international organization 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.520
 which student organization is she 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.860
 is the largest in student 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.310
 organization in the world there are 126 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.120
 countries we are trying to 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:34.000
 help people develop their potential 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.780
 trying to promote the development of the world 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.840
 and 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.600
 consent cards because we 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.640
 we carry out some kind of internal 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.310
 projects that take place in Kazakhstan and 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.780
 international international projects 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.580
 projects imply that we are 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.130
 invite and send intern with 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.900
 different countries come to us openwork from 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.489
 other countries and work on our 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.560
 project we send interns 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.600
 Kazakhstan on other points of the world 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.230
 I am not involved in social projects 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.150
 provided by ayzek in those cities 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.580
 asic is not a club, but I am sitting 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.470
 international organization accordingly 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.250
 we all have certain 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.180
 positions and we work accordingly 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.770
 these posts 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.180
 we do 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.920
 work we conduct weekly speeches on 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.980
 which we define our goal and we 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.200
 work work in teams for example i 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.820
 I am the ayzek marketing director 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.040
 Astana 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.560
 accordingly, I am responsible for all channels 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.970
 connection that he exists I have my own 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.770
 the team with which we are together 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.570
 develop a marketing plan with 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.840
 whom we work with for their 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.490
 design and it all carries out in principle 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.010
 all the others work in the same way 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:47.170
 department they have a director together 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.480
 with their team they define the goal and 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.570
 tasks and works on reaching childhood 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.990
 one more question which is very often not 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:58.510
 I know a lot 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:01.090
 these are questions of motivation simply how 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:05.470
 motivating yourself is probably eternal 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.900
 problem but motivation it depends only 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.790
 from yourself 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.940
 if you want to do something pipe and 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.550
 children hold and if you have the desire 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.530
 Of course of course a bunch of lie on 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.140
 couch than do something really 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.880
 worthwhile i just lain about 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.560
 two hours before i start 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.920
 shoot this video because i was 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.560
 really physically lazy I'm tired and 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:32.290
 all that but this is what I want 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.630
 engage so I forced myself and 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:38.080
 kick in the ass from eating too made me 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.780
 I do not like to sit still and I am very 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.460
 I like to study I really like when something 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.930
 really happening in my life and 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:48.610
 it inspires and motivates me 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:51.730
 which I sit in one place I realize 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:54.280
 what I like you know yourself you 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.900
 my brakes and and I know that I 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.150
 I can do a lot 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.040
 potential and if they sit and nothing 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.040
 don't do that and never reach them 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:06.190
 the height of which I dream so I get up 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.440
 and start doing even if i don't want 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.080
 do this and even if it seems to me 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.930
 very difficult next to me there are people 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.090
 which are the same goals which also 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:19.260
 motivated which is also about something 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:22.840
 dream therefore surround myself with people 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:25.780
 who are also seeking something 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:28.540
 very important it is probably the most important 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.820
 that everyone should do it 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.360
 surround yourself with positive motivated 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.450
 by people 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.880
 motivating it surround yourself 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.770
 positive and motivated people 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.900
 so you will become 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:44.080
 better and the people around you you become 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:46.840
 better if you wait for some sign if 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.450
 are you waiting for some jolt then its not 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.850
 will be until we give it to ourselves 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:55.510
 and if you definitely need something that 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:58.570
 make you go forward to your goal then 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:00.340
 Now let this video be original 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:03.940
 point start working on your dream 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:07.110
 even if you are very, very scared or 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.110
 everything will work out
