00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.809
 hi to all today we're going 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.030
 make two global style bracelets 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.250
 gold rails so to do this you need 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.760
 shape memory wire keeps its shape 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.010
 round 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.050
 you will take a sharp pliers and 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.790
 cut so that both 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.769
 ends meet like you 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.510
 can see it on the picture and so you 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.510
 will do that said this time 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.580
 you will select a circle in 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.080
 metal you take a round- nose pliers 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.500
 and you will loop on one 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.500
 ends 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.600
 m 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.250
 select the fathers of your choice 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.680
 so I took the black pearls 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.680
 mates and you insert 33 beads 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.520
 continue by inserting another color 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.200
 so here I took the gold colored beads 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:43.140
 and you 're going to insert 33 lose for 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.580
 finish so again 33 matte black father then 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.580
 loop to seal everything 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.600
 you will find in detail here the number 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:53.070
 beads to insert to make 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.390
 the others pass them so you go 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.950
 having to do them twice 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.950
 except for the number 9 bracelet 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.810
 once that realized that's the result 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.450
 koné extremely fine wire 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.790
 of the year the bracelet number one you to them 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.130
 surround the wire twice around 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.960
 of the fire on one side take the 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.880
 bracelet number 2 you will check 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.650
 that the position is correct by watching 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.180
 on the medium of creation held 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.310
 firmly both bracelets and you 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.110
 go on hooked you go hang on 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.610
 first aurelie to the second by doing 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.450
 this manipulation leaves you the 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.450
 look in pictures 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.500
 do the same for the 3rd 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.500
 bracelet so check his position 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.850
 held the bracelets firmly and 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.950
 hang the second the second bracelet 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.460
 at the third so always with this 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.460
 handling 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.110
 do this up to the roots set 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.019
 work for a section and until 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.849
 bracelet number 8 for the other so with 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.439
 the wire left you both 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:18.189
 sides the bracelets as you can 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:19.780
 see on the picture with the arrows and 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:21.340
 you can clearly see that on 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.220
 the right section there is a bracelet 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.799
 in more so in summary you will put 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.569
 set of bracelets section must 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.639
 it's really well set up 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.889
 for the form of creation to be 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:35.440
 perfect take a right cloud chip 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:38.889
 not like mine of 7 cm insert a 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:42.269
 loss inserted also a loop and then a 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:42.269
 other pearl and so on 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.389
 cumulated 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.760
 Why 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.500
 Oh 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.150
 here I add the second section and I 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.840
 continued to bored the loop to 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.840
 beads etc 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:07.260
 cut off the surplus is done a loop of 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.260
 what 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.340
 my 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:21.019
 it's exactly the same thing from 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.019
 side 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.130
 here is the result so I admit that enough 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.660
 tedious case of poisoning 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.380
 version that is a little bit more 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.380
 accessible 

00:04:36.829 --> 00:04:41.279
 the second version is very simple you 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:44.959
 have selected the fathers of your 

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:44.959
 choice that comes close to the style 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:54.000
 koné the shape memory wire and you 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.000
 go selected six areas 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:09.430
 once it's done cut a 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.430
 loop on one of the ends 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.790
 you will insert the losses of your 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.790
 choice 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.180
 as you can see in the picture he 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:21.180
 have to make a big full 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.940
 then made a grimace that thought all 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:02.529
 Here's the result 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.790
