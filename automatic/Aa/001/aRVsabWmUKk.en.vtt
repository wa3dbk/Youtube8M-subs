00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.520 
Amazing Spiderman the movie which I
thought<00:01:59.759> was<00:01:59.880> not<00:02:00.030> so<00:02:00.299> amazing<00:02:00.509> how<00:02:01.140> awesome

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
thought was not so amazing how awesome

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.480 
thought was not so amazing how awesome
would<00:02:01.590> have<00:02:01.710> been<00:02:01.829> if<00:02:01.950> they<00:02:02.070> had<00:02:02.159> done<00:02:02.250> Miles

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
would have been if they had done Miles

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.330 
would have been if they had done Miles
Morales<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.240> mean<00:02:03.960> they<00:02:04.140> just<00:02:04.170> had<00:02:04.590> spider-man

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
Morales I mean they just had spider-man

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.789 
Morales I mean they just had spider-man
with<00:02:05.549> Peter<00:02:05.759> Parker<00:02:06.049> they<00:02:07.049> like<00:02:07.259> kind<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.619> neat

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
with Peter Parker they like kind of neat

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.020 
with Peter Parker they like kind of neat
I<00:02:07.920> think<00:02:08.129> they<00:02:08.190> just<00:02:08.220> made<00:02:08.429> that<00:02:08.759> movie

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
I think they just made that movie

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.270 
I think they just made that movie
because<00:02:09.450> they<00:02:10.319> had<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.649> do<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:10.979> keep<00:02:11.009> the

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
because they had to do it to keep the

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.340 
because they had to do it to keep the
rights<00:02:11.489> so<00:02:12.480> why<00:02:12.660> not<00:02:12.840> go<00:02:12.989> to<00:02:13.050> toe

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
rights so why not go to toe

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.810 
rights so why not go to toe
different<00:02:13.680> direction<00:02:13.770> and<00:02:14.130> make<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.460> different

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
first appearance but it's kind of

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:14.600 
first appearance but it's kind of
expensive<00:05:10.610> Batman<00:05:11.690> for<00:05:12.690> 87<00:05:13.590> the<00:05:13.800> breaking<00:05:14.310> of

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.360 
his back
I<00:05:15.690> like<00:05:16.440> this<00:05:16.590> cover<00:05:16.830> I<00:05:16.950> wish<00:05:17.070> they<00:05:17.220> didn't

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
I like this cover I wish they didn't

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.710 
I like this cover I wish they didn't
have<00:05:17.460> the<00:05:17.580> dinosaur<00:05:18.030> in<00:05:18.120> the<00:05:18.180> background<00:05:18.630> I

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
have the dinosaur in the background I

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.210 
have the dinosaur in the background I
know<00:05:18.780> it's<00:05:19.260> supposed<00:05:19.350> to<00:05:19.500> the<00:05:19.650> Batcave<00:05:20.010> and

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
know it's supposed to the Batcave and

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.250 
know it's supposed to the Batcave and
stuff<00:05:20.400> but<00:05:20.640> I<00:05:20.910> think<00:05:21.540> it<00:05:21.690> kind<00:05:21.870> of<00:05:21.930> takes<00:05:22.110> away

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
stuff but I think it kind of takes away

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.420 
stuff but I think it kind of takes away
from<00:05:22.710> it<00:05:23.370> but<00:05:23.580> yep<00:05:24.680> classic<00:05:25.680> book<00:05:26.190> pretty

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
from it but yep classic book pretty

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.290 
from it but yep classic book pretty
important<00:05:27.050> spawn<00:05:28.050> number<00:05:28.440> one<00:05:29.090> they<00:05:30.090> made<00:05:30.270> a

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
important spawn number one they made a

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.210 
important spawn number one they made a
bazillion<00:05:30.840> copies<00:05:31.350> of<00:05:31.440> this<00:05:31.530> so<00:05:31.800> I<00:05:31.830> know<00:05:31.950> it's

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
bazillion copies of this so I know it's

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:42.170 
bazillion copies of this so I know it's
not<00:05:32.400> really<00:05:32.580> that<00:05:33.030> exciting<00:05:33.510> but<00:05:41.180> Hawkeye

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
not really that exciting but Hawkeye

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.300 
not really that exciting but Hawkeye
number<00:05:42.540> one<00:05:42.690> this<00:05:42.900> is<00:05:43.020> his<00:05:43.230> first<00:05:43.530> solo<00:05:43.860> series

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
number one this is his first solo series

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.980 
number one this is his first solo series
it<00:05:44.910> is<00:05:45.090> not<00:05:45.240> nearly<00:05:45.450> as<00:05:45.600> good<00:05:45.780> as<00:05:45.900> the

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
it is not nearly as good as the

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.750 
it is not nearly as good as the
Wolverine<00:05:46.350> series<00:05:46.650> but<00:05:46.860> I<00:05:47.040> figured<00:05:47.490> it<00:05:47.640> was

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
Wolverine series but I figured it was

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.010 
Wolverine series but I figured it was
kind<00:05:47.970> of<00:05:48.030> my<00:05:48.210> attempt<00:05:48.690> at<00:05:48.780> an<00:05:48.870> investment

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
kind of my attempt at an investment

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.659 
kind of my attempt at an investment

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.280 
of Damian Wayne who I thought was such a

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.090 
of Damian Wayne who I thought was such a
cool<00:06:44.670> character<00:06:45.000> really<00:06:45.660> good<00:06:45.960> idea<00:06:46.320> I<00:06:46.740> think

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.320 
it really opens up a lot of avenues that

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.770 
it really opens up a lot of avenues that
you<00:06:49.380> can<00:06:49.470> explore<00:06:50.040> with<00:06:50.370> Batman<00:06:50.820> and<00:06:50.850> it's
