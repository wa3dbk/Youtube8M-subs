00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.530
 Hello everyone 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:12.209
 It is the life of the world rubber market 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.360
 I am very nervous about the product introduction for a moment this time, but thank you for your consideration 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:14.360
 I will 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:22.289
 Commodity only let me now introduce is the bench technology Hen of rave Institute dvd 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:31.840
 This item has been sold before 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:35.830
 Let me introduce what kind of content I have actually seen the content 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:40.900
 By the way, the contents of this dvd is of tabletop technology 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:46.970
 Become a dvd centered on click technology 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:48.750
 There are three things that can be gained by looking at this dvd and mastering the technique 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:53.829
 First one eye 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:56.280
 It's easy to deploy after receiving and bringing it to the rally 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:01:01.790
 Many of the rally players and good players 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:05.300
 It is often referred to as will lead to the rally enters the receive from the longer ones 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:11.360
 The player who is good at rally is more than the development from the stop 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:15.530
 If you are happy to receive a long reception such as Flick or Suzuki, it will often be your rally 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:20.930
 Makes it possible that a particular in a good expansion 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:25.200
 Tutsuki will be the development of hitting or hitting the drive of it 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:29.130
 The player who is not good at blocking is considered to be a severe deployment 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:34.860
 The second is that you will not get used to your own platform technology 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:38.340
 Are accustomed to can be during the game to be habituated to the other party will make their deployment 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:42.700
 There is no such thing as being reversed 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:46.420
 I also have experience, for example, the first half of the game 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.550
 Toka receive the sunset eyes was valid until 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:53.860
 Well as the game goes on 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:56.110
 Being able to get used to sleeping with someone who can be 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.500
 There is 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:05.740
 So many techniques to reduce such things 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:08.220
 For example, it is possible to use flicks that hit the other side of the opponent or flicks of mackles 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.220
 Is required 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:20.190
 When the other party uses various technologies, I do not know what the other party will do next 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:24.490
 In other words, when you will be able to use many technologies , make various developments in the game 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:30.440
 You can to increase the width of their tactics to allow 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:35.660
 The third is that lead to scores destroy the opponent in the receive of doubles 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:42.840
 In the case of doubles, the course where Saab comes is decided, and there are many developments from the almost short serve 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:47.879
 So it is possible to break the opponent with the receive platform technology and finish with the fourth ball. 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:52.140
 In doubles it is said that 70% of the rally will be determined by the surf race 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:57.569
 Therefore the receive to connect to the score is very important 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:03:01.990
 In addition, it is more than able to cope with not only receive but also the stopped ball 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:05.680
 It is also possible to take the lead and connect to the score 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:11.230
 Because this dvd makes the flick explanation polite 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:17.270
 I want to remember flick that way flick was perfectly good enough Wakarazu at beginners 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:24.530
 I think that you can study enough even if you want to use flicks properly 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:30.430
 Also, if you are an intermediate player, you can extend the range of your play that Flick 's kind of bench technology blows out 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:35.349
 It is one piece that we want to see by all means to person who wants to increase two kinds of flicks in order to 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.860
 We explained the three things above, but explain the points when you look at this dvd 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:43.490
 I will 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:48.380
 Not only looking at dvd and understanding, but actually taking the racket in hand and using that arm 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:53.450
 It is recommended to go and see people and images together 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:56.850
 It is easier to learn the sense that the image remains when practicing the user 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.080
 Then I will arrange it in my own form 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.760
 Is possible 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:07.780
 People who are good at rally but not good at blocks 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:12.480
 People who want to expand their rally but are not good at bench technology 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:17.489
 A person who is attacked by the opponent without getting ahead first in doubles 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:22.590
 Recommended for those who are trying to challenge new platform technology 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:25.360
 It's hard to see such information, and I've never heard of it 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:30.039
 There were new ideas 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:35.940
 I think it's very important to introduce different opinions from quality 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:38.600
 Please take a look at those who are troubled with the technology and want to learn 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.600
 Thank you very much
