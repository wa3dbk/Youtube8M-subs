as going around as you can tell by the

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:03.889 
as going around as you can tell by the
title<00:00:02.669> what<00:00:02.939> you're<00:00:03.060> gonna<00:00:03.149> see<00:00:03.389> today<00:00:03.540> is

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.960 
title what you're gonna see today is
sniping<00:00:04.470> highlights<00:00:04.830> with<00:00:05.100> the<00:00:05.310> the<00:00:05.580> rifle

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
sniping highlights with the the rifle

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.440 
sniping highlights with the the rifle
called<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.330> SRR<00:00:06.890> 61<00:00:07.890> I<00:00:08.519> believe<00:00:09.150> it's<00:00:09.300> the

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
called the SRR 61 I believe it's the

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.150 
called the SRR 61 I believe it's the
last<00:00:09.660> unlock<00:00:10.080> that<00:00:10.320> isn't<00:00:10.650> actually<00:00:10.830> an

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
last unlock that isn't actually an

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.150 
last unlock that isn't actually an
assignment<00:00:11.670> unlock<00:00:12.030> for<00:00:12.269> battlefield<00:00:12.780> 4<00:00:13.160> and

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
assignment unlock for battlefield 4 and

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.369 
assignment unlock for battlefield 4 and
so<00:00:15.089> far<00:00:15.299> I<00:00:15.330> just<00:00:15.630> unlocked<00:00:15.780> it<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:16.320> just

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
so far I just unlocked it I just

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.170 
so far I just unlocked it I just
unlocked<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:17.070> straight<00:00:17.310> pull<00:00:17.550> bolt<00:00:17.580> for<00:00:18.060> it

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
unlocked the straight pull bolt for it

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.730 
unlocked the straight pull bolt for it
so<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.330> haven't<00:00:18.539> even<00:00:18.720> got<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.050> rangefinder<00:00:19.320> or

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
so I haven't even got the rangefinder or

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.400 
so I haven't even got the rangefinder or
anything<00:00:19.920> for<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.460> but<00:00:21.119> my<00:00:21.330> goodness<00:00:21.840> this<00:00:22.260> is

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
anything for it but my goodness this is

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.019 
anything for it but my goodness this is
a<00:00:22.439> great<00:00:22.740> gun<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.220> already<00:00:23.369> know<00:00:23.640> just<00:00:23.910> by

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
a great gun and I already know just by

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.490 
a great gun and I already know just by
the<00:00:24.090> feel<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.449> it<00:00:24.510> listen<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.990> sound<00:00:25.320> of

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
the feel of it listen to the sound of

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.950 
the feel of it listen to the sound of
this<00:00:25.590> thing<00:00:25.650> it's<00:00:26.640> just<00:00:26.730> this<00:00:27.689> thing's

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
this thing it's just this thing's

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.130 
this thing it's just this thing's
amazing<00:00:28.730> great<00:00:29.730> sound<00:00:30.090> great<00:00:30.539> feel<00:00:30.900> and

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
amazing great sound great feel and

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.410 
amazing great sound great feel and
incredible<00:00:32.009> amounts<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.430> power<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.390> think

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
incredible amounts of power and I think

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.970 
incredible amounts of power and I think
it<00:00:33.660> has<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.930> least<00:00:34.170> bullet<00:00:34.380> drop<00:00:34.739> in<00:00:34.890> the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
it has the least bullet drop in the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.590 
it has the least bullet drop in the
longest<00:00:35.370> range<00:00:35.640> in<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.910> game<00:00:36.120> if<00:00:36.329> I'm<00:00:36.480> not

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
longest range in the game if I'm not

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.250 
longest range in the game if I'm not
mistaken<00:00:37.190> I<00:00:38.190> can<00:00:38.700> absolutely<00:00:39.270> be<00:00:39.690> seeing<00:00:40.020> this

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
mistaken I can absolutely be seeing this

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.069 
mistaken I can absolutely be seeing this
one<00:00:40.530> becoming<00:00:41.030> basically<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.300> full-time<00:00:42.780> use

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
one becoming basically a full-time use

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.310 
one becoming basically a full-time use
one<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.500> one<00:00:43.710> might<00:00:43.920> be<00:00:43.950> my<00:00:44.899> m98b<00:00:45.899> of

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
one this one might be my m98b of

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.500 
one this one might be my m98b of
battlefield<00:00:46.860> 3<00:00:46.950> despite<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.090> fact<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.360> the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
battlefield 3 despite the fact that the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.680 
battlefield 3 despite the fact that the
m9<00:00:48.840> ap<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.260> actually<00:00:49.649> in<00:00:49.739> battlefield<00:00:50.219> 4<00:00:50.690> the

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
m9 ap is actually in battlefield 4 the

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.959 
m9 ap is actually in battlefield 4 the
stats<00:00:51.960> with<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.410> say<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.399> has<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.579> hundred

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
stats with it say that it has a hundred

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.040 
stats with it say that it has a hundred
damage<00:00:54.149> up<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.840> 12.5<00:00:55.320> meters<00:00:56.149> and<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.719> drop

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
damage up to 12.5 meters and the drop

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.660 
damage up to 12.5 meters and the drop
off<00:00:58.320> becomes<00:00:59.070> 59<00:00:59.760> damage<00:01:00.449> once<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.500> pass<00:01:01.770> 150

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
off becomes 59 damage once you pass 150

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.490 
off becomes 59 damage once you pass 150
meters<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.180> this<00:01:03.329> gun<00:01:03.539> has<00:01:03.809> an<00:01:03.930> incredible

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
meters so this gun has an incredible

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.130 
meters so this gun has an incredible
amount<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:05.040> damage<00:01:05.309> output<00:01:05.700> an<00:01:06.140> incredible

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
amount of damage output an incredible

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.340 
amount of damage output an incredible
range<00:01:08.630> the<00:01:09.630> reload<00:01:10.049> time<00:01:10.080> for<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:12.000> think

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
range the reload time for it is I think

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.530 
range the reload time for it is I think
4.8<00:01:13.350> seconds<00:01:14.010> when<00:01:14.610> there's<00:01:14.850> not<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.060> bullet<00:01:15.420> in

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
4.8 seconds when there's not a bullet in

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.130 
4.8 seconds when there's not a bullet in
the<00:01:15.689> chamber

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
the chamber

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.630 
the chamber
and<00:01:16.290> it's<00:01:16.439> 3<00:01:16.710> seconds<00:01:17.159> when<00:01:17.250> there<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.610> a

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
and it's 3 seconds when there is a

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.249 
and it's 3 seconds when there is a
bullet<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.270> chamber<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.840> it's<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.020> reload

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
bullet in the chamber so it's a reload

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.710 
bullet in the chamber so it's a reload
time<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:19.500> pretty<00:01:19.830> good<00:01:20.070> too<00:01:20.330> the<00:01:21.330> time<00:01:21.540> to

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
time is pretty good too the time to

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.960 
time is pretty good too the time to
cycle<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.140> bolt<00:01:22.320> isn't<00:01:22.770> very<00:01:23.009> long<00:01:23.280> it's<00:01:23.729> it's

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
cycle the bolt isn't very long it's it's

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.050 
cycle the bolt isn't very long it's it's
actually<00:01:24.119> pretty<00:01:24.540> decent<00:01:25.009> the<00:01:26.009> actual<00:01:26.460> rounds

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
actually pretty decent the actual rounds

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.140 
actually pretty decent the actual rounds
fire<00:01:27.360> at<00:01:27.570> 620<00:01:28.470> meters<00:01:28.619> per<00:01:28.979> second<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.520> its

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
fire at 620 meters per second and its

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.230 
fire at 620 meters per second and its
maximum<00:01:30.390> range<00:01:30.689> is<00:01:31.259> 3100<00:01:32.100> meters<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:32.880> this

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
maximum range is 3100 meters so this

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.730 
maximum range is 3100 meters so this
would<00:01:33.420> probably<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.140> gun<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.439> want<00:01:34.650> to

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
would probably be the gun you want to

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.140 
would probably be the gun you want to
use<00:01:34.890> if<00:01:35.070> you're<00:01:35.220> going<00:01:35.280> for<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.820> longest

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
use if you're going for the longest

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.719 
use if you're going for the longest
sniper<00:01:36.450> shot<00:01:36.810> on<00:01:36.960> youtube<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:38.340> this<00:01:38.549> one's

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
sniper shot on youtube and this one's

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.999 
sniper shot on youtube and this one's
also<00:01:38.909> it's<00:01:39.180> it's<00:01:39.810> not<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.110> best<00:01:40.409> choice<00:01:40.530> if

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
also it's it's not the best choice if

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.289 
also it's it's not the best choice if
you<00:01:41.100> were<00:01:41.220> gonna<00:01:41.310> go<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.670> aggressive<00:01:42.090> recon

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
you were gonna go the aggressive recon

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.850 
you were gonna go the aggressive recon
approach<00:01:42.780> but<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.259> probably<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.680> best

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
approach but it is probably the best

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.399 
approach but it is probably the best
choice<00:01:44.210> if<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.390> prefer<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.930> least<00:01:46.110> bullet

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
choice if you prefer the least bullet

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.530 
choice if you prefer the least bullet
drop<00:01:46.860> off<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.520> prefer<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.390> know

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.749 
drop off and you prefer you know
incredible<00:01:49.409> amount<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.799> damage<00:01:50.040> output<00:01:50.399> in

incredible amount of damage output in

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.660 
incredible amount of damage output in
shorter<00:01:51.689> range<00:01:52.130> but<00:01:53.130> again<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.490> only

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
shorter range but again the only

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.420 
shorter range but again the only
drawback<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.360> bolt<00:01:54.720> cycling<00:01:55.259> is<00:01:55.439> decently

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
drawback is the bolt cycling is decently

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.880 
drawback is the bolt cycling is decently

like 200 from the looks of it just aim

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.260 
like 200 from the looks of it just aim
slightly<00:02:54.620> above<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:55.400> guy's<00:02:55.580> head<00:02:55.820> and<00:02:55.850> fire

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.650 
in my sniper rifle recon breakdowns
because<00:03:15.680> that's<00:03:16.010> you<00:03:16.490> know<00:03:16.610> a<00:03:16.640> level<00:03:16.880> specific

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
because that's you know a level specific

that only one person can get at a time I

that only one person can get at a time I
figure<00:03:23.240> it<00:03:23.870> would<00:03:23.990> probably<00:03:24.530> be<00:03:25.310> the<00:03:25.850> most

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
figure it would probably be the most

accurate in terms of being able to

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 
measure output and accessibility if I

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:33.610 
measure output and accessibility if I
was<00:03:32.330> to<00:03:32.420> only<00:03:32.570> include<00:03:32.900> guns<00:03:33.230> that<00:03:33.350> you<00:03:33.470> can

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
was to only include guns that you can

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.250 
was to only include guns that you can
get<00:03:33.770> through<00:03:33.980> unlocks<00:03:34.720> because<00:03:35.720> well<00:03:35.930> like<00:03:36.140> if

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
get through unlocks because well like if

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.750 
get through unlocks because well like if
I<00:03:36.380> have<00:03:36.470> the<00:03:36.590> 50<00:03:36.860> caliber<00:03:37.070> and<00:03:37.430> you<00:03:37.610> were<00:03:37.700> in

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
I have the 50 caliber and you were in

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
be able to get it and we wouldn't be

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.660 
be able to get it and we wouldn't be

in<00:03:46.880> that<00:03:47.030> game<00:03:47.300> is<00:03:47.540> an<00:03:47.840> insta-kill<00:03:48.230> where

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
in that game is an insta-kill where

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.960 
in that game is an insta-kill where
wherever<00:03:48.710> you<00:03:48.860> hit<00:03:49.070> the<00:03:49.190> guy<00:03:49.340> in<00:03:49.370> whatever

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
wherever you hit the guy in whatever

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.660 
wherever you hit the guy in whatever
range<00:03:50.270> you<00:03:50.540> hit<00:03:50.690> the<00:03:50.810> guy<00:03:51.010> and<00:03:52.010> that's<00:03:52.490> why

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
range you hit the guy and that's why

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.730 
range you hit the guy and that's why
there's<00:03:52.880> only<00:03:52.970> one<00:03:53.240> of<00:03:53.330> them<00:03:53.450> that's<00:03:53.960> why<00:03:54.200> it's

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740 
there's only one of them that's why it's

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.160 
there's only one of them that's why it's
not<00:03:54.950> a<00:03:55.010> feature<00:03:55.310> gun<00:03:55.670> otherwise<00:03:56.090> Walt<00:03:56.690> sniping

not a feature gun otherwise Walt sniping

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.600 
not a feature gun otherwise Walt sniping
would<00:03:57.290> be<00:03:57.410> incredibly<00:03:57.800> overpowered<00:03:58.400> and

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
would be incredibly overpowered and

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.350 
would be incredibly overpowered and
you'd<00:03:59.360> have<00:03:59.540> 64<00:04:00.440> man<00:04:00.680> servers<00:04:01.160> with<00:04:01.400> 64<00:04:02.150> people

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
you'd have 64 man servers with 64 people

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.990 
you'd have 64 man servers with 64 people
playing<00:04:02.720> recon<00:04:03.260> and<00:04:03.560> that's<00:04:04.310> I'm<00:04:04.520> sure<00:04:04.790> not

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
playing recon and that's I'm sure not

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.300 
playing recon and that's I'm sure not
what<00:04:05.660> everyone<00:04:05.900> wants<00:04:06.410> and<00:04:06.680> not<00:04:06.920> that<00:04:07.130> I

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
what everyone wants and not that I

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.360 
what everyone wants and not that I

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
certainly wants this one here on

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.420 
certainly wants this one here on
Paracels<00:04:11.060> storm<00:04:11.860> it's<00:04:12.860> actually<00:04:13.190> one<00:04:13.310> of<00:04:13.340> my

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
Paracels storm it's actually one of my

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.920 
Paracels storm it's actually one of my
least<00:04:13.670> favorite<00:04:13.730> maps<00:04:14.150> at<00:04:14.360> the<00:04:14.420> moment<00:04:14.780> just

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
least favorite maps at the moment just

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.170 
least favorite maps at the moment just
in<00:04:15.080> terms<00:04:15.260> of<00:04:15.470> how<00:04:15.950> it<00:04:16.130> plays<00:04:16.400> but<00:04:16.730> for<00:04:16.880> sniping

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
in terms of how it plays but for sniping

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.760 
in terms of how it plays but for sniping
is<00:04:17.330> fine<00:04:17.540> I<00:04:17.720> find<00:04:17.930> it<00:04:18.049> pretty<00:04:18.260> good<00:04:18.320> to<00:04:18.560> a<00:04:18.590> lot

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:18.770 
is fine I find it pretty good to a lot

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:20.830 
is fine I find it pretty good to a lot
of<00:04:18.799> people<00:04:19.100> like<00:04:19.220> to<00:04:19.250> go<00:04:19.430> on<00:04:19.549> the<00:04:19.580> islands<00:04:20.000> yeah

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
of people like to go on the islands yeah

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.640 
of people like to go on the islands yeah
I<00:04:20.870> do<00:04:21.109> hit<00:04:21.440> I<00:04:21.470> think<00:04:21.560> an<00:04:22.010> over<00:04:22.280> 6

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
I do hit I think an over 6

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.710 
I do hit I think an over 6
Meteor<00:04:23.040> headshot<00:04:23.430> on<00:04:23.550> it<00:04:23.699> and<00:04:23.850> you'll<00:04:24.419> notice

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
Meteor headshot on it and you'll notice

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.360 
Meteor headshot on it and you'll notice
the<00:04:24.900> bullet<00:04:25.229> drop<00:04:25.350> on<00:04:25.650> it<00:04:25.800> is<00:04:25.919> pretty<00:04:26.130> decent

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
the bullet drop on it is pretty decent

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.100 
the bullet drop on it is pretty decent
but<00:04:27.120> that's<00:04:27.270> because<00:04:27.419> I<00:04:27.600> didn't<00:04:27.840> dope<00:04:27.960> my

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
but that's because I didn't dope my

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.200 
but that's because I didn't dope my
skull<00:04:28.410> if<00:04:29.100> you<00:04:29.310> dope<00:04:29.520> your<00:04:29.699> skull<00:04:29.910> like<00:04:29.940> on

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
skull if you dope your skull like on

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.760 
skull if you dope your skull like on
this<00:04:30.330> gun<00:04:30.570> that's<00:04:30.780> why<00:04:30.930> I<00:04:30.960> like<00:04:31.199> it<00:04:31.229> the<00:04:31.440> most<00:04:31.470> I

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
this gun that's why I like it the most I

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.620 
this gun that's why I like it the most I
think<00:04:31.800> is<00:04:32.100> -<00:04:32.669> because<00:04:32.940> you<00:04:33.060> barely<00:04:33.240> even<00:04:33.419> have

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
think is - because you barely even have

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.390 
think is - because you barely even have
to<00:04:33.750> dope<00:04:33.930> your<00:04:34.110> scope<00:04:34.350> for<00:04:34.530> this<00:04:34.650> thing<00:04:34.830> aim

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
to dope your scope for this thing aim

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.550 
to dope your scope for this thing aim
slightly<00:04:35.639> above<00:04:36.150> the<00:04:36.300> guy's<00:04:36.449> head<00:04:36.750> and<00:04:37.020> it's

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
slightly above the guy's head and it's

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.409 
slightly above the guy's head and it's
an<00:04:37.680> almost<00:04:37.919> instant<00:04:38.370> headshot<00:04:38.789> even<00:04:39.090> inside

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
an almost instant headshot even inside

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.960 
an almost instant headshot even inside
well<00:04:40.169> it's<00:04:40.289> an<00:04:40.380> insta<00:04:40.710> side<00:04:41.130> 200<00:04:41.580> but<00:04:41.699> even<00:04:41.910> if

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
well it's an insta side 200 but even if

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.279 
well it's an insta side 200 but even if
it's<00:04:42.120> if<00:04:42.300> you're<00:04:42.389> a<00:04:42.449> three<00:04:42.690> four<00:04:42.900> hundred<00:04:43.050> you

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:43.289 
it's if you're a three four hundred you

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:45.050 
it's if you're a three four hundred you
aim<00:04:43.410> slightly<00:04:43.889> above<00:04:44.130> and<00:04:44.340> you're<00:04:44.850> still

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
aim slightly above and you're still

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.180 
aim slightly above and you're still
gonna<00:04:45.150> hit<00:04:45.330> the<00:04:45.449> guy<00:04:45.570> in<00:04:45.600> the<00:04:45.750> head<00:04:45.949> at<00:04:46.949> six

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
gonna hit the guy in the head at six

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.040 
gonna hit the guy in the head at six
hundred<00:04:47.310> I<00:04:47.550> had<00:04:47.699> to<00:04:47.789> put<00:04:48.000> it<00:04:48.090> slightly<00:04:48.300> but

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
hundred I had to put it slightly but

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.360 
hundred I had to put it slightly but
like<00:04:49.169> a<00:04:49.199> notch<00:04:49.470> or<00:04:49.680> two<00:04:49.800> above<00:04:50.039> on<00:04:50.280> the

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
like a notch or two above on the

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.310 
like a notch or two above on the
eight-time<00:04:50.699> scope<00:04:51.090> and<00:04:51.270> it<00:04:51.330> was<00:04:51.449> still<00:04:51.720> an

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
eight-time scope and it was still an

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.560 
eight-time scope and it was still an
immediate<00:04:52.800> headshot<00:04:53.250> if<00:04:53.970> you<00:04:54.150> dope<00:04:54.360> your

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
immediate headshot if you dope your

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.360 
immediate headshot if you dope your
scope<00:04:54.840> with<00:04:55.020> this<00:04:55.169> thing<00:04:55.410> you<00:04:55.560> can<00:04:55.740> probably

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
scope with this thing you can probably

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.279 
scope with this thing you can probably
easily<00:04:56.880> hit<00:04:57.030> a<00:04:57.060> thousand<00:04:57.539> and<00:04:57.690> you'd<00:04:57.960> barely

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
easily hit a thousand and you'd barely

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:00.500 
easily hit a thousand and you'd barely
see<00:04:58.440> the<00:04:58.560> bullet<00:04:58.800> drop<00:04:58.919> much<00:04:59.220> at<00:04:59.370> all<00:04:59.520> but

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
see the bullet drop much at all but

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:01.820 
see the bullet drop much at all but
that's<00:05:00.600> a<00:05:00.780> breakdown<00:05:01.110> of<00:05:01.320> it<00:05:01.440> those<00:05:01.590> were<00:05:01.710> the

that's a breakdown of it those were the

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.980 
that's a breakdown of it those were the
stats<00:05:02.039> with<00:05:02.250> it<00:05:02.370> hopefully<00:05:03.090> enjoy<00:05:03.570> this<00:05:03.750> gun

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990
