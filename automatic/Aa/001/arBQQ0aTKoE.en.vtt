00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:11.670
 the with people will be your pc and the Europeans 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.340
 the forum will be even the pc you have a pc 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.650
 three years up there will always be 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.660
 But my people and you do not know how 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.520
 he father only realized the will be I will 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.670
 teach you so well 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.490
 the staff arrives and takes us there first 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:31.170
 you'll have to start running and 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.390

 Okay, and then go, go and see a lot. 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.260
 dirt and sectors suggest that when 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.820
 you start in the optão so it's mexico 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.510
 applications and record here in the 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.520
 system 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.219
 the idea is to discuss all human species 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:57.690
 start run and type percent 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:59.850
 time and can only be there 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.559
 right time to cancel the button one block 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.500
 of notes 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.689
 for those who do not know how it is thus by 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.240
 percent time but will form and attack 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.510
 funk use font 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.439
 I'm going to do it at the most, that's the way it is 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.740
 folks 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:24.450
 O percent time per cent do not have or is 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:26.189
 not have the flash and will give an ok there is that 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.700
 all the staff these urgency will be left 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.360
 a personal after flash lite yet I 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.360
 I love you guys, start running and type 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.360
 recent 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.140
 I'll make it here, it's going to be a success. 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:51.210
 because here I am and what not to do 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:53.130
 better this all says mark s sesi is 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.140
 playing personal rock I 'll be 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.619
 available in the video description and 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.680
 but before that the egg that is here 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.649
 before I was in the next phase because it 's the 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.820
 which is also what leaves the controller 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.610
 Do you know what it is? 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.720
 you get many visual effects in the 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.550
 your windows 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.430
 for you to solve this, there you go 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:22.550
 will you guys start to 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.550
 computer properties 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:33.920
 I will wait for the advanced settings of the 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:37.050
 system gives a click that obviously worse 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.720
 performance visual effects scheduling 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:43.740
 of processing 2 is memory usage 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:46.680
 let's tighten settings 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.110
 your pattern is fine so do not let the 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.000
 windows choose the best option with everything 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.510
 this is due to the visual effects that 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.060
 cashing read that you do good to 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:01.490
 people are going to get the best performance and 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:05.250
 Just come back here and use shadows on 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:09.330
 subject and rocks the source 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.940
 visual styles inhabit the pec 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.400
 rectangles if you want what it is to be 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.910
 made that goes bad of the boxing legs 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.650
 the exchange does not want to apply you 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.380
 like every dog ​​I explained that I'm going 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.510
 Play what you want to do here. 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.610
 Make a hiss to let my plan be this 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.800
 then there is what gives close to everything that you 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.100
 They'll do what you're going to do. 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:37.080
 which is the next you see a year 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:39.180
 I think the staff will give all the 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.959
 wallpapers that you have 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.830
 I'm going to put that windows 7 attack 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.830
 of the seven that is better 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.900
 then the person is out there 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:06.700
 3 even at the ready without doing now 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.000
 then if at least you will not have the same 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.459
 that the business is blue in the 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 money and the recommendation to 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:18.669
 You who have one so thinks is 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:26.680
 very slow is that you will start 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:32.440
 perform and ms confirm death is 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:42.340
 It took us an hour to eco 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:46.360
 ms with fig then that's where it goes 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:49.930
 the system configuration is displayed 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:53.290
 here o booting the system options 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.610
 advanced its pattern yet the 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.729
 attack 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.710
 if the pattern will have thus unchecked 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:04.990
 everything and here as the brand will give a 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:08.860
 boat and 2 depending there you go up child 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.600
 that the adopted and collapsed stop year more 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.200
 in case my grandmother disable it because 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:16.000
 I want 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:19.419
 then I will give is ok QZP and PSOL is 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.320
 Right there, you're going to bump it together. 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:25.090
 on startup you go here 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.430
 initialization of programs 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:31.300
 deactivation of your antivirus in case the 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.610
 hot box what the deal is these will give a 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.410
 OK 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.610
 after the initial start he knows that 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:40.810
 I do not want the young audience that 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:44.340
 now and ready people with time here 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:47.760
 the company is the following do now 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:50.830
 What are you going to do now? 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.970
 16 01 must have a program called 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:56.430
 disk max 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:06:00.630
 it personal and clean all your registration 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:02.639
 clean to all citizens if it's trash 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.510
 the times the system does a lot of thing 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:05.160
 for you 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:10.980
 Let's wait a little bit with the 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:19.770
 tricolor and there they will hope not 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:24.440
 is content with personal apple clay 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.440
 what to expect a little bit of litigation with clay 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:32.990
 I was in all the programs, we're just going 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.990
 wait a little bit 

00:06:58.189 --> 00:07:03.090
 I'm going to take a quick pass in the 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:06.240
 video to find and finish that 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:09.330
 when you finish d 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:13.460
 so I ended up cleaning here 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:16.110
 Back to top of the page up there ^ 

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:19.379
 ready, people are finished 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:23.699
 As you can see here is the daughter of 

00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:27.539
 techteam spaces this one o everything was a 

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:29.759
 mega edge is recovered from hd 

00:07:27.539 --> 00:07:32.969
 good folks who have already finished the 

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:35.340
 time 27 seconds here in the field 

00:07:32.969 --> 00:07:38.789
 not only the 27 seconds to do 

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:42.300
 I have to do it twice you can 

00:07:38.789 --> 00:07:44.729
 make such a personal plan here once 

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:48.060
 My thought was how can you see it? 

00:07:44.729 --> 00:07:52.349
 He is much faster than he was. 

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:55.319

00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:59.719
 One more video lesson 

00:07:56.939 --> 00:08:04.550
