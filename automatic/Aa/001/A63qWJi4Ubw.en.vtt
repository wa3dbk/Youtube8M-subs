 good evening my women and men 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.470
 in news today are often asked why it always 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.170
 But bad news must be how to deliver the bus as well 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.330
 To report positive would be in this moaning colorful world 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.280
 But even today, the events in Japan and also overshadow the events 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.900
 Events in Libya again everything positive what to report we give 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.770

 open end 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.649
 the second message is about a steep rise of two unsuccessful ones 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:27.160
 Guys from Manchester 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.970
 Thieve the number of visitors to the genre of music Spoleto meet 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.020
 be inspired by this and henceforth as electro-pop duo Kurtz 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.420
