00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:22.090
 What about friends and in this tutorial 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:24.340
 how to click the first thing 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.710
 we have to do is a well done baby 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.270
 but with my head high it does not work 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.520
 doing it like that has to be with the head 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.439
 up and the chosen feet exactly 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.360
 so once we have the baby we have to 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.910
 know that this hand is the one you support 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.739
 and the other one that makes you spin so 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:43.059
 we put on the baby and we try that 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:44.739
 we turn we look again we turn around the 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.570
 society after knowing how to stretch a 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.820
 little we have to learn to vote with 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.469
 this hand is to say we put on baby and 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.329
 we force with the arm and the 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:54.429
 legs up 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:58.960
 and we jump right with just the right hand 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:01:00.909
 We jump once we control these 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.289
 two things we can begin to clarify 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:03.729
 you have to do the baby with your hand 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:06.610
 Looking as far back as possible 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:07.899
 then we started spinning and when 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.789
 we are about to reach the top 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:12.100
 we have to jump and turn the other hand 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:16.040
 backwards 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:21.070
 and now we can keep turning when 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:23.510
 we change again we change again 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.730
 we change and it's about doing that every 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:34.610
 faster and without stopping 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:36.800
 well at the beginning they were quite the 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.780
 dolls is normal so do not miss 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.000
 practicing it when it hurts to rest 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.860
 a while later you try it again and that 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.450
 they will get used to the dolls and I think 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.770
 that I only hope that I have served you 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.600
 this tutorial on how to make a quique 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.020
 so see you in another video here 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.020
