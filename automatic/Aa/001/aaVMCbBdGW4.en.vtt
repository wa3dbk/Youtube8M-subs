let's get started assembling the first
thing<00:00:42.300> we<00:00:42.450> need<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.660> do<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:43.050> attach<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.620> end

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
thing we need to do is attach the end

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.850 
thing we need to do is attach the end
coders<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:44.850> will<00:00:45.090> need<00:00:45.270> your<00:00:45.420> end<00:00:45.570> coder

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
coders so you will need your end coder

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.880 
coders so you will need your end coder
your<00:00:46.860> bolt<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.489> your<00:00:48.180> spacer<00:00:48.660> as<00:00:48.870> well<00:00:49.680> as<00:00:49.860> a

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
regulation portion of your machine so

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.319 
regulation portion of your machine so
it's<00:00:59.129> important<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.730> they're<00:01:00.000> attached

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
it's important that they're attached

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.450 
it's important that they're attached
correctly<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.289> they<00:01:01.559> run<00:01:01.770> smoothly<00:01:02.190> on

the<00:01:02.579> track<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.199> wheel<00:01:04.409> rotating<00:01:06.080> that

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
the track it is the wheel rotating that

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.899 
the track it is the wheel rotating that
tells<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.710> needle<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.189> go<00:01:08.310> up<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.729> down<00:01:08.850> on

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
tells the needle to go up and down on

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.030 
tells the needle to go up and down on
your<00:01:09.240> machine<00:01:09.570> anytime<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.860> wheel

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
your machine anytime that the wheel

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.830 
your machine anytime that the wheel
doesn't<00:01:11.460> rotate<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:12.119> doesn't<00:01:12.570> send<00:01:12.780> the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
doesn't rotate it doesn't send the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.800 
doesn't rotate it doesn't send the
message<00:01:13.260> for<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.590> needle<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.040> move<00:01:14.540> the<00:01:15.540> first

message for the needle to move the first
thing<00:01:15.990> we<00:01:16.110> want<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.380> do<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.799> turn<00:01:17.280> over<00:01:17.670> your

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
thing we want to do is turn over your

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.700 
thing we want to do is turn over your
lower<00:01:18.090> carriage

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.000 

locate<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.850> hole<00:01:24.030> on<00:01:24.299> your<00:01:24.450> wheel<00:01:24.630> bar<00:01:25.010> and

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
locate the hole on your wheel bar and

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.350 
locate the hole on your wheel bar and
attach<00:01:26.369> your<00:01:26.400> encoder<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:28.729> hole<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:29.970> pre

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
attach your encoder the hole is pre

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.950 
attach your encoder the hole is pre
tapped<00:01:31.880> so<00:01:32.880> your<00:01:33.030> bolt<00:01:33.240> should<00:01:33.479> screw<00:01:33.780> in

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
tapped so your bolt should screw in

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.210 
tapped so your bolt should screw in
pretty<00:01:34.320> easy<00:01:36.560> your<00:01:37.560> end<00:01:37.740> coder<00:01:37.979> is

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
pretty easy your end coder is

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.880 
pretty easy your end coder is
spring-loaded<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.360> this<00:01:39.600> piece<00:01:39.930> here<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.470> what

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
spring-loaded so this piece here is what

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.490 
spring-loaded so this piece here is what
activates<00:01:41.340> your<00:01:41.759> spring<00:01:42.180> we<00:01:43.110> want<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.380> make

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
activates your spring we want to make

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.990 
activates your spring we want to make
sure<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.920> it's<00:01:44.130> pretty<00:01:44.460> much<00:01:44.640> in<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.970> straight

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
sure that it's pretty much in a straight

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.520 
sure that it's pretty much in a straight
line<00:01:45.509> with<00:01:45.720> your<00:01:45.899> encoder<00:01:47.450> as<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.720> tighten<00:01:49.110> it

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.320 

so<00:01:52.530> when<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.770> let<00:01:52.950> go<00:01:52.979> your<00:01:53.580> end<00:01:53.790> coder<00:01:54.030> should

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
so when you let go your end coder should

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.570 
so when you let go your end coder should
pop<00:01:54.570> up

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
pop up

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.460 
pop up
so<00:01:56.580> again<00:01:56.850> if<00:01:57.000> it's<00:01:57.149> down<00:01:57.420> when<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.080> let<00:01:58.259> go

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
so again if it's down when you let go

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.830 
so again if it's down when you let go
you<00:01:58.590> should<00:01:58.920> see<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.220> pop<00:01:59.429> up<00:01:59.670> and<00:02:00.630> that's

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
you should see it pop up and that's

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.800 
you should see it pop up and that's
going<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.080> help<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.410> hug<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.770> track<00:02:02.630> okay<00:02:03.630> now

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
going to help it hug the track okay now

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.779 
going to help it hug the track okay now
we're<00:02:03.990> ready<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.410> turn<00:02:04.590> over<00:02:04.649> our<00:02:05.490> lower

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
we're ready to turn over our lower

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:11.770 
we're ready to turn over our lower
carriage<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.509> place<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:06.960> on<00:02:07.050> the<00:02:07.170> track<00:02:10.220> and

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
carriage and place it on the track and

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.530
