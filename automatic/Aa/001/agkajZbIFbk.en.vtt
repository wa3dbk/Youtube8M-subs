00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.050
 or that of imposing point cl on the day of 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.889
 today I come to do a boxing of a 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.889
 3ds game 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:17.170
 this rabbit when for three times 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.370
 over here internal official product for 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.370
 Chile 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:32.180
 good as you know the game is cubes 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.720
 so that they would become ultra see or mega 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.880
 famous with rayman wells 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.730
 they had their own spin off either a 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.640
 series of games for wii which I 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.900
 I have several I love these rabbits 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.300
 so now let's try to see what 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.800
 How are you? 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.080
 there's really not much information about 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.840
 this game on the internet like here it came out 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.290
 but without grief or glory in reality the 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.380
 game 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.410
 if we are going to proceed to open it and I 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.090
 I had opened a bit because 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.440
 to be able to open it with a pure hand is 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.440
 much more or less 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.680
 I had shown in front 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.680
 the favor is supposed 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.370
 it is a fight mode 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.030
 when you have to fight with others 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.030
 rabbit 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.860
 we are going to open it 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.510
 here we have 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.159
 This strikes me 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:33.539
 one 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.560
 a nintendo club pamphlet inside 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:38.350
 a set of radios 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.790
 because it reminds us that other games 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.259
 your raid wii achievements 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.990
 also three general among an intern if 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.970
 I'm not mistaken, it seems that 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.280
 I'll try the photo of the fire another 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.960
 once or both 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.530
 obviously not showing the code for 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:57.750
 that do not occupy great 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.750
 I have a letter ar 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.140
 then we will see what is in 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.930
 the letter 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.970
 and the manual 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.830
 finally the manuals of the games of 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.350
 today or stews come in several languages ​​in 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.360
 English in French and in Spanish so 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.370
 less 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.370
 today we will see how it is and manual 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.600
 black and white that was 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.659
 that forms x com is horrible the manual 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.819
 We do not have to s 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.920
 to a qr code and to add a rabbit 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.420
 the char king brigade that is nothing more and 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:04.849
 nothing less than 1 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:04.849
 a king dressed in a shark costume 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.510
 louis chat they used to have used 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.830
 play the monster to the movies of 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.870
 terror was not only in their attributes 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.030
 predators because water could eat 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.530
 anything when hungry 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.110
 clone 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.110
 and then we're going to prove that he has the 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:27.060
 chick and basically back the 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.060
 propaganda for the rapid land paraguay 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.260
 the attack that was blank and 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:35.630
 black in 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:38.690
 the manual already as few see 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.810
 the color manuals as they were 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.810
 before 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.140
 because in reality, as they are, it seems 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.069
 is trying to cost more 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.069
 and the game 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.520
 rabbit bamboo 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.660
 and we have the little game, now I'm going to 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.330
 play a little while to see if together with the 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.400
 video I can give you a little review 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.400
 of what the game is because as they 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.040
 I said I bought it almost blindly because 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.859
 I like rallies 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.739
 and this was the first game that is the 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.590
 reality of the grammys for 3ds because 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:27.080
 from that 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.080
 if there was another game 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.399
 the rabbit go home 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:34.540
 not through time if I'm not wrong 

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:37.870
 it was the other one that had the radios 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:40.450
 but this is not really much 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.910
 information on the internet so now what 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:46.930
 let's try and I'll tell you there 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.850
 that both how about the game so they 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:53.040
 I tell you how to see if it's worth it 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:55.360
 buy it or if it really was a facebook 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.010
 got many thanks for these 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.820
 small minutes with me 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:03.970
 they accompanied so I leave them 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.520
 I see them in game tournaments and sometimes there was 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.940
 another video or I describe the review 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.940
 take care see you
