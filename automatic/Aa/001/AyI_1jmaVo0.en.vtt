00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130 
and then if you had a horse boat you

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.570 
and then if you had a horse boat you

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:11.200 
that on for 24 hours and then do it

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.400 
that on for 24 hours and then do it
again<00:06:11.470> it<00:06:12.750> must<00:06:13.750> feel<00:06:13.900> a<00:06:13.930> little<00:06:14.050> bit<00:06:14.200> weird

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:14.410 
again it must feel a little bit weird

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.410 
again it must feel a little bit weird
but<00:06:14.590> also<00:06:15.130> having<00:06:15.400> the<00:06:15.580> padding<00:06:15.940> underneath<00:06:16.150> a

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:16.420 
but also having the padding underneath a

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:17.880 
but also having the padding underneath a
much<00:06:16.630> may<00:06:16.780> be<00:06:16.840> the<00:06:16.930> leader<00:06:17.050> for<00:06:17.500> the<00:06:17.620> horse<00:06:17.800> a

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:17.890 
much may be the leader for the horse a

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:38.520 
much may be the leader for the horse a
little<00:06:18.070> bit<00:06:18.160> more<00:06:18.310> comfortable

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:38.530
