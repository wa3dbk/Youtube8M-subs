00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
what you all get started up but then my

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.130 
what you all get started up but then my
act<00:01:09.060> doesn't<00:01:09.180> really<00:01:09.360> wanna<00:01:09.509> stay<00:01:09.690> around<00:01:09.840> too

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.730 
act doesn't really wanna stay around too
much<00:01:14.240> but<00:01:15.240> these<00:01:15.479> kinds<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:15.960> interactions<00:01:16.649> are

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
much but these kinds of interactions are

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.010 
much but these kinds of interactions are
could<00:01:16.860> be<00:01:16.890> really<00:01:17.399> really<00:01:17.430> valuable<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.390> us

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.230 

right<00:01:22.020> now<00:01:22.340> and<00:01:23.340> that's<00:01:23.490> probably<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.030> main

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
right now and that's probably the main

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.779 
right now and that's probably the main
reason<00:01:24.300> Hiawatha<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.770> it's<00:01:26.070> possible<00:01:26.670> that

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:26.789 
reason Hiawatha and it's possible that

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:30.020 
reason Hiawatha and it's possible that
my<00:01:27.539> act<00:01:27.750> didn't<00:01:28.110> even<00:01:28.229> do<00:01:28.500> anything<00:01:28.530> but<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.759> was

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
my act didn't even do anything but I was

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.760 
my act didn't even do anything but I was
worried<00:01:30.479> enough<00:01:30.720> about<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.259> she<00:01:31.500> says<00:01:31.740> oh

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
worried enough about it that she says oh

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.740 
worried enough about it that she says oh
there<00:01:32.070> comes<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.429> big<00:01:32.580> the<00:01:33.149> big<00:01:33.179> old<00:01:33.539> whale<00:01:33.720> I

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
there comes the big the big old whale I

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.130 
there comes the big the big old whale I
better<00:01:34.140> get<00:01:34.289> out<00:01:34.440> of<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.619> way<00:01:35.660> but<00:01:36.660> I<00:01:36.840> wanted

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
better get out of the way but I wanted

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.469 
better get out of the way but I wanted
you<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.380> see<00:01:37.649> this<00:01:37.920> he<00:01:38.490> does<00:01:38.670> very<00:01:38.880> much<00:01:39.210> like

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
you to see this he does very much like

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.930 
you to see this he does very much like
the<00:01:39.690> Penguins<00:01:40.140> who<00:01:40.229> were<00:01:40.350> seeing<00:01:40.590> today<00:01:40.940> we

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
the Penguins who were seeing today we

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.249 
the Penguins who were seeing today we
can<00:01:42.119> engage<00:01:42.270> in<00:01:42.810> these<00:01:42.869> kinds<00:01:43.229> of

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
can engage in these kinds of

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.870 
can engage in these kinds of
interactions<00:01:43.530> with<00:01:43.950> these<00:01:44.160> animals<00:01:44.399> and

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
interactions with these animals and

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.749 
interactions with these animals and
there's<00:01:45.840> no<00:01:46.050> question<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.770> in<00:01:46.950> my<00:01:47.130> mind<00:01:47.429> they

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
there's no question that in my mind they

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.850 
there's no question that in my mind they
enjoy<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.450> they<00:01:48.630> look<00:01:48.990> forward<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.649> they

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
enjoy it they look forward to it they

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.249 
enjoy it they look forward to it they
solicit<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:51.000> that's<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.479> big<00:01:51.780> part<00:01:52.050> of

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
solicit it and that's a big part of

00:01:52.259 --> 00:02:06.039 
solicit it and that's a big part of
building<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.710> relationship

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.700 

we<00:02:06.680> often<00:02:07.280> will<00:02:07.340> do<00:02:07.490> things
