00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.858
 My name is Michael Fiedler and I am Sales Manager at Blucher. 

00:00:09.383 --> 00:00:12.473
 We are part of the Gladius system. 

00:00:12.926 --> 00:00:20.831
 and we supply all clothing, ballistics and bearing systems. 

00:00:21.706 --> 00:00:26.549
 For example, this is the Future Soldier Gladius lineup 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:34.547
 We supply clothing complete with underwear 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.927
 and it is possible to combine several different materials 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.600
 We are able to provide the comfort of a soldier in various climatic conditions 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.103
 in the temperature range from -30 ° C to 49 ° Celsius 

00:00:53.686 --> 00:01:03.301
 The idea is that a soldier has one piece of equipment with which to travel anywhere in the world and effectively perform the mission. 

00:01:03.381 --> 00:01:14.394
 Now let's look at ballistic protection. This ballistic vest emphasizes ergonomics and the needs of the soldier 

00:01:14.394 --> 00:01:22.360
 which can then easily move, cover and shoot. 

00:01:23.394 --> 00:01:27.296
 You can also see built-in electronics for multiple devices and systems. 

00:01:29.376 --> 00:01:37.412
 Not only for Gladius, we incorporate C4I directly into the carrier system. 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.699
 For example, there is an antenna, GPS, and there is a radio with batteries and other essentials inside. 

00:01:47.843 --> 00:01:57.603
 The main idea of ​​this system is that the soldier does not carry the whole weight on his shoulders 

00:01:59.152 --> 00:02:04.000
 It helps with the belt around the hips, which transfers a greater portion of the load to the hips. 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.321
 That's why wearing the C4I is very comfortable. 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.071
 We work on many technologies ourselves, for example, on clothing functionality 

00:02:13.686 --> 00:02:16.474
 I would like to mention our effective heat and sweat removal device 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.291
 which we have developed to increase the comfort of our soldiers. 

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:26.291
 we are constantly improving and tuning this system. 

00:02:28.046 --> 00:02:34.517
 Other manufacturers are also involved in development and production, but the main technology is ours. 

00:02:34.493 --> 00:02:42.000
 Said load distribution or clothing functionality and thermoregulation devices 

00:02:42.493 --> 00:02:44.919
 they are our key tenchologies and therefore we make them ourselves. 

00:02:45.301 --> 00:02:52.000
 The Gladius solution integrator is Rheinmetall Defense, and there are many other subcontractors 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 and we focus mainly on clothing. 

00:02:54.837 --> 00:03:03.509
 Now all the goods are ready for delivery to German units. 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.500
 This system will be introduced for units next year.
