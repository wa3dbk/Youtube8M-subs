00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
of the mall so I decided keep it

of the mall so I decided keep it
I<00:02:25.140> also<00:02:25.590> spawned<00:02:25.980> myself<00:02:26.310> in<00:02:26.459> a<00:02:26.550> couple<00:02:26.790> of

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
I also spawned myself in a couple of

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.820 
I also spawned myself in a couple of
items<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.450> didn't<00:02:27.720> spot<00:02:27.930> any<00:02:28.200> diamonds<00:02:28.739> in

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
items I didn't spot any diamonds in

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.580 
items I didn't spot any diamonds in
there<00:02:29.040> because<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:29.700> keeping<00:02:30.330> lot<00:02:30.480> legit<00:02:30.870> but

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
there because and keeping lot legit but

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.759 
there because and keeping lot legit but
I<00:02:31.950> started<00:02:32.730> off<00:02:32.849> with<00:02:33.030> zero<00:02:33.090> iron<00:02:33.930> so<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:34.560> guess

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
I started off with zero iron so I guess

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:35.870 
I started off with zero iron so I guess
I'm<00:02:34.860> going<00:02:35.069> to<00:02:35.130> keep<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:35.459> like<00:02:35.580> that<00:02:35.610> because

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
I'm going to keep it like that because

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.210 
I'm going to keep it like that because
since<00:02:36.330> bond<00:02:36.480> did<00:02:36.630> all<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.930> items<00:02:37.290> in<00:02:37.560> for<00:02:38.099> the

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
since bond did all the items in for the

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.880 
since bond did all the items in for the
kitchen<00:02:38.580> up<00:02:38.730> there<00:02:38.910> also<00:02:39.900> I<00:02:39.930> added<00:02:40.410> in<00:02:40.650> some

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890

printing<00:02:43.500> stuff<00:02:43.920> here<00:02:44.400> I<00:02:44.819> felt<00:02:45.150> like<00:02:45.330> I

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
printing stuff here I felt like I

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.330 
printing stuff here I felt like I
couldn't<00:02:45.870> really<00:02:46.049> be<00:02:46.200> bothered<00:02:46.349> spending

of wouldn't fit right and it would look
kind<00:05:02.069> of<00:05:02.099> awkward<00:05:02.610> so<00:05:02.940> I<00:05:03.000> decided<00:05:03.419> to<00:05:03.509> just<00:05:03.690> add

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
kind of awkward so I decided to just add

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.689 
kind of awkward so I decided to just add
four<00:05:04.110> why<00:05:04.349> not<00:05:04.560> it<00:05:04.650> looks<00:05:04.770> cool<00:05:05.069> so<00:05:05.310> this<00:05:05.460> is<00:05:05.580> my

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:05.699 
four why not it looks cool so this is my

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:07.790 
four why not it looks cool so this is my
enchanting<00:05:06.300> tower<00:05:06.479> and<00:05:06.870> I<00:05:07.229> think<00:05:07.620> it<00:05:07.710> looks

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
enchanting tower and I think it looks

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.430 
enchanting tower and I think it looks
pretty<00:05:08.069> cool<00:05:08.370> it<00:05:08.550> looks<00:05:08.729> really<00:05:09.030> nice<00:05:09.240> um<00:05:09.719> I

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
but the honest answer is I've been

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.260 
but the honest answer is I've been
trying<00:05:28.319> to<00:05:28.500> fix<00:05:28.740> it<00:05:28.979> me<00:05:29.520> and<00:05:29.580> my<00:05:29.639> friend<00:05:29.940> Erin

trying to fix it me and my friend Erin
was<00:05:30.479> kind<00:05:30.690> of<00:05:30.750> like<00:05:30.900> looking<00:05:31.409> around<00:05:31.560> the<00:05:31.860> mods

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:32.069 
was kind of like looking around the mods

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:34.430 
was kind of like looking around the mods
to<00:05:32.279> see<00:05:32.460> what<00:05:32.580> happened<00:05:32.969> and<00:05:33.300> I<00:05:33.569> reckon<00:05:34.259> just

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
to see what happened and I reckon just

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.290 
to see what happened and I reckon just
minecraft<00:05:34.919> decided<00:05:35.370> to<00:05:35.490> die<00:05:35.669> that<00:05:35.909> day<00:05:35.940> and

spaz out and delete my house so I don't
know<00:05:39.000> I<00:05:39.270> reckon<00:05:39.840> that<00:05:39.870> in<00:05:40.380> future<00:05:40.919> episodes

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
know I reckon that in future episodes

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.670 
know I reckon that in future episodes
everything<00:05:42.330> will<00:05:42.449> get<00:05:42.569> back<00:05:42.719> to<00:05:42.930> normal<00:05:42.960> and
