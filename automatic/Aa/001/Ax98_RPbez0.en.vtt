00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.230
 Welcome to Ben Ammar Let's go to work 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.090
 day the theme of media in central greece 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.280
 we are talking about statistics 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.049
 descriptive when we talk about the 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.340
 measures of central tendency we should 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:21.680
 we give a small definition what 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.560
 things are these measures the measures of 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.210
 trends tickets are known as 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.670
 averages too and what they do is 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.580
 locate the data center these 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.410
 averages are going to be in this case for 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.020
 our study are three media 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.699
 medium fashion arithmetic and when 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.320
 let's talk about mérimée tica we're also going to 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:41.269
 talk about geometric mean and average 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.519
 harmonica let's start studying the 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:47.089
 medium and you have to know that the 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:49.489
 median is symbolized as m is the 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:52.069
 called median value of a series of 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.589
 data or known as the 50th percentile 

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:56.420
 what does the median do in the median 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:58.999
 is the number that is paid to the series of 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.489
 data ordered in two equal parts 

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:03.379
 number of data this means that the 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.030
 median to find the median you 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.370
 first you are going to sort the data in 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.320
 increasing or decreasing and going to greet 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.350
 you are going to locate the 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.530
 the data that divides all the data in 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.479
 two equal parts according to the 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.760
 median is the average measure that 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.830
 depends on the number of data and not on the 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.960
 values ​​of the data the median we are going to 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.970
 work for non-clustered data that 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.729
 it comes to be when we're talking about 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.680
 categories the first step are sorted the 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.680
 data increasingly and then I am 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.660
 central example carvalho look at the median 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.820
 of these data asks you are asking you 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.009
 find that you will sort the data in 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.190
 increasing way and you will locate the 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:46.190
 data that occupies the present half and 50 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.050
 for this case it's going to be 16 I calculated the 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.750
 median of the following data the 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.270
 data are here they're messy you're 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.240
 to order them increasingly and the 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.479
 median for example for this case in 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.580
 the data is a lot of data there would not be a 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.350
 just one piece of information that divides all of them 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.240
 the data in two equal parts so 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.910
 both the median comes to be the semi 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.519
 sum of the data that are in the center 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.400
 that comes from 30 plus 36 over 2 the 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:14.470
 median for grouped data 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.090
 let's define it in two steps how are you going 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.549
 to guide the median for pooled data 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.560
 you will first locate the interval that 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:23.439
 contains the median this means 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.939
 You're going to locate where this is in the middle 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:27.069
 you are going to place it on the axis of 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:28.720
 accumulated frequencies that is for you 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.250
 you can do this study you have to 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.349
 have the distribution table of 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.780
 frequencies by intervals right okay 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:37.720
 done step 1 proceed to step 2 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.909
 which says the median is given by limit 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.970
 lower plus where you get by 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:44.590
 interpolation not to see where is this 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.019
 scope of the interval as the frequency 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.879
 of absolute frequency variation is 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.069
 to the absolute frequency I do not think 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.690
 that I'm going to take a special class to 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.239
 make this little demonstration already 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.939
 that in this grace we can not 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.349
 understand us so much but let's say that 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:01.090
 the median is the lower limit of 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.099
 interval where the median is located 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.470
 to the variation of the absolute frequency 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:07.209
 about the white absolute frequency this 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.410
 average that we're going to see us in the 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.780
 fashion 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.760
 the fashion for a series of data is 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.690
 defines as the data that occurs with greater 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.880
 often if you want only the data 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.740
 the most repeated of all the data that 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.590
 they give you the most repeated that data 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.850
 represents fashion for these when 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.010
 work with real functions of 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.290
 Real variable function of a fashion and 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.960
 comes to be the value of the variable in 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.750
 which there is an absolute maximum fashion 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.750
 it does not always exist and if it does not always exist 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.730
 is unique is the least important average 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.160
 because of its ambiguity then I'm going to 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.890
 show what we are talking about fashion 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.440
 should be used as a benchmark 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.270
 nothing else should not be calculated both 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.320
 averages I'm referring the median 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.720
 and the arithmetic mean 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.030
 efe fashion for data grouped by 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.790
 intervals ready as easy as there are 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.990
 believe me until doing the following one 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.300
 frequency distribution by 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.520
 intervals the fashion is located in the 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.960
 interval with greater absolute frequency 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.820
 that is, you have the difference table 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.530
 frequencies and locates of all is the 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.890
 table where is the interval with highest 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.840
 frequency in that interval you make ends 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.269
 your fashion and how are you going to get it out 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.269
 fashion is equal to the lower limit more 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:22.060
 the absolute frequency difference 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:25.120
 about the absolute frequency sum 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:28.389
 for the breadth of what things one of 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.370
 one for us one for us 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:33.250
 is frequency quite the 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.229
 previous absolute frequency and sub 2 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.750
 it comes to be the frequency absolutely 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:40.240
 the good later absolute frequency 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.479
 we look young the arithmetic mean the 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.580
 arithmetic mean to non-grouped data of 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:47.680
 data that are in categories and we're 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.810
 speaking a small sample less than 20 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.300
 data to see what we can say about the 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.490
 average value metric suppose 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.590
 value one of the doubles of n values ​​of 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.889
 a quantitative variable is equal 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.810
 young and average metric symbology is 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:03.790
 equal to the sum total of data on the 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.780
 number of data because it is quite clear 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:09.280
 do not add up a lot of data are 3 5 7 and 9 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.530
 effects and I ask you what is in the middle and 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.780
 metric is going to add those numbers is going to 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.940
 be obvious 5 because they give you 25 data 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.669
 arithmetic for data grouped by 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.500
 intervals yes we have has values ​​of 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:23.620
 A variable 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:25.810
 let's say your average grouped by 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.330
 intervals to find your average I 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.340
 I need the class marks of each 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.680
 interval and absolute frequencies 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:35.860
 so that you can say the average 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:39.040
 arithmetic is the sum total of data 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.530
 one for the f 1 for its brand of class 1 + 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.000
 f 2 for its class 2 + brand of festes 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.220
 for your brand of class 3 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.100
 so on all the intervals 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:50.200
 what do you have about n 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:53.580
 I think that's all about the 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.580
 averages for today
