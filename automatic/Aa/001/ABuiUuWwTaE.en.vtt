00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
hi there my name is Rob and we're going

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.289 
hi there my name is Rob and we're going
to<00:00:03.270> be<00:00:03.389> reviewing<00:00:03.810> mind<00:00:04.740> node<00:00:05.220> for<00:00:05.640> iPad<00:00:06.089> it's

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
to be reviewing mind node for iPad it's

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.650 
to be reviewing mind node for iPad it's
a<00:00:06.420> mind<00:00:06.660> mapping<00:00:06.990> application<00:00:08.330> so<00:00:09.330> this<00:00:09.540> is

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
a mind mapping application so this is

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.140 
a mind mapping application so this is
the<00:00:09.780> application<00:00:10.309> very<00:00:11.309> simple<00:00:11.700> sort<00:00:12.090> of

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
the application very simple sort of

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.999 
the application very simple sort of
front-end<00:00:12.599> interface<00:00:12.870> so<00:00:13.380> we<00:00:13.500> just<00:00:13.679> literally

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
front-end interface so we just literally

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.029 
front-end interface so we just literally
click<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.400> new<00:00:14.670> mind<00:00:15.179> map<00:00:15.450> there<00:00:15.750> it<00:00:16.590> comes<00:00:16.830> up

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
click a new mind map there it comes up

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.939 
click a new mind map there it comes up
we<00:00:17.190> can<00:00:17.369> tap<00:00:18.060> these<00:00:18.560> DoubleTap<00:00:19.560> these<00:00:19.740> things

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
we can tap these DoubleTap these things

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.150 
we can tap these DoubleTap these things
here<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.250> rename<00:00:20.580> them<00:00:20.789> so<00:00:21.680> here<00:00:22.680> we<00:00:22.769> go<00:00:22.980> let's

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
here to rename them so here we go let's

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:32.510 
here to rename them so here we go let's
put<00:00:23.519> in<00:00:23.670> there<00:00:30.710> so<00:00:31.710> it's<00:00:31.830> got<00:00:31.949> spellcheck

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
put in there so it's got spellcheck

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:40.869 
put in there so it's got spellcheck
there<00:00:36.050> done<00:00:37.050> we<00:00:38.010> can<00:00:38.190> once<00:00:38.790> we<00:00:38.879> started<00:00:39.860> our

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
there done we can once we started our

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.040 
there done we can once we started our
mind<00:00:41.879> map<00:00:42.059> at<00:00:42.149> any<00:00:42.270> point<00:00:42.510> we<00:00:42.629> want<00:00:42.750> we<00:00:42.899> can

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
mind map at any point we want we can

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.459 
mind map at any point we want we can
just<00:00:43.230> go<00:00:43.410> back<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:44.149> main<00:00:45.149> menu<00:00:45.420> go<00:00:45.870> into<00:00:46.440> a

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
just go back to the main menu go into a

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.340 
just go back to the main menu go into a
different<00:00:46.739> one<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.940> can<00:00:48.059> see<00:00:48.270> how<00:00:48.690> complex

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
different one so you can see how complex

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.380 
different one so you can see how complex
these<00:00:49.649> can<00:00:49.890> get<00:00:50.039> them<00:00:50.250> back<00:00:50.399> out<00:00:50.640> back<00:00:51.000> into

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
these can get them back out back into

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.150 
these can get them back out back into
review<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:51.840> it's<00:00:51.989> all<00:00:52.110> auto-saves<00:00:52.710> again<00:00:53.010> we

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
review so it's all auto-saves again we

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.689 
review so it's all auto-saves again we
can<00:00:53.309> quit<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.090> app<00:00:54.829> reopen<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.100> we'll<00:00:56.489> come

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
can quit the app reopen and we'll come

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.310 
can quit the app reopen and we'll come
back<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:57.030> where<00:00:57.180> we<00:00:57.300> were<00:00:57.329> or<00:00:57.840> back<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.230> our

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
back to where we were or back to our

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.490 
back to where we were or back to our
main<00:00:58.500> stop<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.449> then<00:01:00.449> adding<00:01:00.780> branches<00:01:01.320> to

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
main stop and then adding branches to

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.139 
main stop and then adding branches to
these<00:01:01.649> or<00:01:01.949> main<00:01:02.100> thing<00:01:02.280> we<00:01:02.399> can<00:01:02.520> drag<00:01:02.910> things

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
these or main thing we can drag things

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.179 
these or main thing we can drag things
around<00:01:03.239> just<00:01:03.660> by<00:01:03.780> dragging<00:01:04.199> we<00:01:04.920> can<00:01:05.040> add<00:01:05.159> a

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
around just by dragging we can add a

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.280 
around just by dragging we can add a
branch<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.820> just<00:01:05.970> adds<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.299> new<00:01:06.479> node<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:07.049> we<00:01:07.080> can

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
branch it just adds a new node so we can

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:15.810 
branch it just adds a new node so we can
call<00:01:07.470> this<00:01:07.590> one<00:01:09.020> good<00:01:10.020> points

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.700 

and<00:01:16.780> very<00:01:17.260> easy<00:01:17.530> to<00:01:17.710> move<00:01:18.310> our<00:01:18.640> points<00:01:19.300> there

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
and very easy to move our points there

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.510 
and very easy to move our points there
so<00:01:20.710> I'll<00:01:20.830> come<00:01:20.979> over<00:01:21.040> here<00:01:21.190> we'll<00:01:21.490> have

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
so I'll come over here we'll have

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.110 
so I'll come over here we'll have
another<00:01:21.820> one<00:01:22.030> called

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
another one called

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:34.070 
another one called
bad<00:01:25.120> points<00:01:30.869> okay<00:01:31.869> so<00:01:32.200> we<00:01:32.320> can<00:01:32.470> pull<00:01:32.680> that<00:01:32.860> one

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
bad points okay so we can pull that one

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.180 
bad points okay so we can pull that one
and<00:01:35.080> as<00:01:35.290> you<00:01:35.320> see<00:01:35.619> if<00:01:35.710> we<00:01:35.830> just<00:01:35.950> click

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
and as you see if we just click

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.770 
and as you see if we just click
generally<00:01:36.790> we<00:01:36.940> can<00:01:37.060> drag<00:01:37.270> the<00:01:37.450> whole<00:01:37.570> thing

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
generally we can drag the whole thing

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.170 
generally we can drag the whole thing
around<00:01:37.979> we<00:01:38.979> can<00:01:39.160> click<00:01:39.460> back<00:01:39.610> on<00:01:39.790> review<00:01:40.060> and

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
around we can click back on review and

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.820 
around we can click back on review and
add<00:01:40.270> more<00:01:40.450> branches<00:01:40.990> to<00:01:41.200> review<00:01:41.560> if<00:01:41.650> you<00:01:41.710> want

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
add more branches to review if you want

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:48.389 
add more branches to review if you want
now<00:01:42.700> or<00:01:42.880> we<00:01:42.970> can<00:01:43.150> click<00:01:43.390> here<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.860> you<00:01:48.160> need<00:01:48.280> to

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
now or we can click here so you need to

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:56.700 
now or we can click here so you need to
use<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:55.060> it's<00:01:55.240> very<00:01:55.270> easy<00:01:55.630> to<00:01:55.720> you<00:01:56.380> know<00:01:56.470> show

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
use and it's very easy to you know show

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.469 
use and it's very easy to you know show
people<00:01:56.950> so<00:01:57.280> if<00:01:57.520> you<00:01:57.670> know<00:01:57.820> people<00:01:58.180> want<00:01:58.450> to

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
people so if you know people want to

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:59.639 
people so if you know people want to
pick<00:01:58.660> it<00:01:58.750> up<00:01:58.810> it<00:01:58.960> so<00:01:59.020> you<00:01:59.110> need<00:01:59.229> to<00:01:59.350> pick<00:01:59.500> up

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
pick it up it so you need to pick up

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:01.800 
pick it up it so you need to pick up
it's<00:02:00.399> quite<00:02:00.580> functional<00:02:01.180> it's<00:02:01.300> got<00:02:01.420> a<00:02:01.450> lot<00:02:01.630> to

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
it's quite functional it's got a lot to

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.830 
it's quite functional it's got a lot to
it<00:02:01.960> so<00:02:02.200> it<00:02:02.560> looks<00:02:02.740> nice

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.029 

so<00:02:07.840> you<00:02:07.899> can<00:02:08.200> see<00:02:08.289> how<00:02:08.440> straightforward<00:02:08.709> isn't

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
so you can see how straightforward isn't

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.620 
so you can see how straightforward isn't
again<00:02:09.310> if<00:02:09.399> I<00:02:09.459> want<00:02:09.610> to<00:02:09.670> individually<00:02:10.330> branch

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
again if I want to individually branch

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.910 
again if I want to individually branch
some<00:02:10.899> of<00:02:10.989> these<00:02:11.080> things<00:02:11.260> up<00:02:11.440> so<00:02:11.560> I've<00:02:11.650> wanted

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
some of these things up so I've wanted

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.949 
some of these things up so I've wanted
to<00:02:11.980> solve<00:02:12.130> instead<00:02:12.310> of<00:02:12.459> a<00:02:12.610> traditional<00:02:13.450> mind

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
to solve instead of a traditional mind

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.900 
to solve instead of a traditional mind
map<00:02:14.170> do<00:02:14.380> almost<00:02:14.530> like<00:02:14.680> a<00:02:14.830> flowchart<00:02:15.220> then<00:02:15.820> I

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
map do almost like a flowchart then I

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.390 
map do almost like a flowchart then I
could<00:02:16.120> do<00:02:16.900> something<00:02:17.140> basic<00:02:17.739> there<00:02:20.400> power

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
could do something basic there power

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.979 
could do something basic there power
points<00:02:23.250> none<00:02:24.250> yet<00:02:24.570> I<00:02:28.330> you<00:02:28.450> paying<00:02:28.690> return

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
points none yet I you paying return

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.840 
points none yet I you paying return
so<00:02:29.200> again<00:02:29.440> we<00:02:29.560> can<00:02:29.650> pull<00:02:29.860> out<00:02:29.980> there<00:02:30.280> we<00:02:30.670> can

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
so again we can pull out there we can

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.280 
so again we can pull out there we can
use<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.150> pinch<00:02:31.360> and<00:02:31.540> zoom<00:02:31.570> and<00:02:31.870> again<00:02:32.049> you<00:02:32.140> can

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
use the pinch and zoom and again you can

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.140 
use the pinch and zoom and again you can
see<00:02:32.410> it's<00:02:32.530> really<00:02:32.799> nice<00:02:33.130> really<00:02:33.489> really<00:02:33.850> soft

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
see it's really nice really really soft

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.539 
see it's really nice really really soft
well<00:02:34.390> done<00:02:34.720> so<00:02:35.560> I've<00:02:35.620> anti-aliasing<00:02:36.220> all<00:02:36.370> that

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
well done so I've anti-aliasing all that

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.520 
well done so I've anti-aliasing all that
has<00:02:36.640> worked<00:02:36.820> well<00:02:37.000> so<00:02:37.540> I<00:02:37.780> found<00:02:38.380> it<00:02:38.470> was

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
has worked well so I found it was

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.110 
has worked well so I found it was
something<00:02:38.890> absolutely<00:02:39.250> humongous<00:02:39.730> and

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
something absolutely humongous and

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.789 
something absolutely humongous and
you've<00:02:40.239> got<00:02:40.360> plenty<00:02:40.540> of<00:02:40.690> space<00:02:40.840> to<00:02:41.019> be<00:02:41.380> yet<00:02:41.680> to

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
you've got plenty of space to be yet to

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.750 
you've got plenty of space to be yet to
be<00:02:42.040> creating<00:02:42.549> it<00:02:42.700> with<00:02:43.890> you<00:02:44.890> can<00:02:45.040> also<00:02:45.160> switch

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
be creating it with you can also switch

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.380 
be creating it with you can also switch
into<00:02:46.120> a<00:02:46.150> ListView<00:02:46.810> so<00:02:47.850> here<00:02:48.850> you<00:02:49.000> can<00:02:49.150> see

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
into a ListView so here you can see

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.420 
into a ListView so here you can see
we've<00:02:49.780> sort<00:02:50.049> of<00:02:50.079> got<00:02:50.230> bullied<00:02:50.590> things<00:02:51.190> out

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
we've sort of got bullied things out

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.020 
we've sort of got bullied things out
dented

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
dented

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.289 
dented
I<00:02:52.060> couldn't<00:02:52.720> here<00:02:53.140> I<00:02:53.170> can<00:02:53.470> add<00:02:53.650> things<00:02:54.269> so<00:02:55.269> I

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
I couldn't here I can add things so I

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:56.910 
I couldn't here I can add things so I
can<00:02:55.480> actually<00:02:55.570> add<00:02:55.989> things<00:02:56.290> in<00:02:56.500> the<00:02:56.590> ListView

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
can actually add things in the ListView

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.509 
can actually add things in the ListView
rather<00:02:57.430> than<00:02:57.730> adding<00:02:58.209> things<00:02:58.690> mm-hmm<00:02:59.440> in<00:03:00.310> the

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
rather than adding things mm-hmm in the

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.400 
rather than adding things mm-hmm in the
actual<00:03:01.530> in<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:02.650> actual<00:03:02.980> and<00:03:03.840> no<00:03:04.840> that's<00:03:05.230> not

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
actual in the actual and no that's not

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.960 
actual in the actual and no that's not
true<00:03:05.530> actually<00:03:05.739> looking<00:03:06.340> about<00:03:06.549> you<00:03:06.700> can't

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
true actually looking about you can't

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.940 
true actually looking about you can't
add<00:03:07.209> things<00:03:07.480> there<00:03:07.750> I<00:03:07.989> thought<00:03:08.680> you<00:03:08.739> could

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
add things there I thought you could

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.949 
add things there I thought you could
have<00:03:09.070> things<00:03:09.250> but<00:03:09.459> you<00:03:09.549> can't<00:03:09.790> so<00:03:10.720> you<00:03:10.750> can't

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
have things but you can't so you can't

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.960 
have things but you can't so you can't
add<00:03:11.079> things<00:03:11.350> what<00:03:11.799> you<00:03:11.890> can<00:03:12.010> do<00:03:12.130> is<00:03:12.220> detach<00:03:12.400> a

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
add things what you can do is detach a

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.360 
add things what you can do is detach a
node<00:03:13.870> so<00:03:14.290> that's<00:03:14.440> quite<00:03:14.620> nice<00:03:14.829> so<00:03:14.860> what<00:03:15.250> you

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
node so that's quite nice so what you

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.250 
node so that's quite nice so what you
can<00:03:15.489> do<00:03:15.640> is<00:03:15.760> actually<00:03:16.120> create<00:03:16.510> a<00:03:16.690> separate

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
can do is actually create a separate

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.470 
can do is actually create a separate
mind<00:03:17.530> map<00:03:17.769> on<00:03:17.920> your<00:03:17.950> page<00:03:18.430> and<00:03:18.760> then<00:03:19.180> start

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
mind map on your page and then start

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.330 
mind map on your page and then start
branching<00:03:19.840> off<00:03:20.079> from<00:03:20.110> that<00:03:20.410> mind<00:03:20.680> map<00:03:20.890> that's

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
branching off from that mind map that's

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.069 
branching off from that mind map that's
quite<00:03:21.549> powerful<00:03:21.700> or<00:03:22.360> you<00:03:22.480> can<00:03:22.600> also<00:03:22.720> do<00:03:22.959> in

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
quite powerful or you can also do in

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.080 
quite powerful or you can also do in
this<00:03:23.170> review<00:03:23.799> part<00:03:24.100> here<00:03:24.340> is<00:03:24.459> change<00:03:24.760> things

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
this review part here is change things

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.010 
this review part here is change things
so<00:03:25.269> for<00:03:25.780> example<00:03:26.370> my<00:03:27.370> good<00:03:27.699> points<00:03:27.940> at

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
so for example my good points at

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.820 
so for example my good points at
what<00:03:29.200> I'd<00:03:29.320> like<00:03:29.470> is<00:03:29.530> for<00:03:30.370> them<00:03:30.550> to<00:03:30.730> be<00:03:30.850> green<00:03:31.830> so

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
what I'd like is for them to be green so

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.160 
what I'd like is for them to be green so
I've<00:03:32.920> got<00:03:33.160> a<00:03:33.190> green<00:03:33.520> they're<00:03:33.880> all<00:03:34.810> a<00:03:34.840> nicer

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
I've got a green they're all a nicer

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.440 
I've got a green they're all a nicer
green<00:03:35.590> than<00:03:35.770> that

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
green than that

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.780 
green than that
there<00:03:37.450> we<00:03:37.540> go<00:03:37.690> that's<00:03:37.840> great<00:03:39.390> and<00:03:41.460> it<00:03:42.460> doesn't

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
there we go that's great and it doesn't

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.910 
there we go that's great and it doesn't
branch<00:03:43.060> down<00:03:43.420> from<00:03:43.810> there<00:03:44.020> so<00:03:44.320> unfortunately

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
branch down from there so unfortunately

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.040 
branch down from there so unfortunately
it<00:03:45.580> doesn't<00:03:45.880> then<00:03:46.000> color<00:03:46.300> everything<00:03:46.630> that

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
it doesn't then color everything that

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:52.680 
it doesn't then color everything that
color<00:03:48.210> which<00:03:49.210> is<00:03:49.390> a<00:03:49.420> shame<00:03:51.090> but<00:03:52.090> we<00:03:52.270> can<00:03:52.480> is

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
color which is a shame but we can is

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.060 
color which is a shame but we can is
still<00:03:52.930> quite<00:03:53.140> straightforward<00:03:53.740> just<00:03:53.860> to

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
still quite straightforward just to

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.280 
still quite straightforward just to
knock<00:03:54.430> those<00:03:54.700> in<00:03:54.940> I<00:03:55.120> mean<00:03:55.270> you'd<00:03:55.420> do<00:03:56.080> this

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
knock those in I mean you'd do this

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.070 
knock those in I mean you'd do this
first<00:03:57.240> really<00:03:58.240> seeing<00:03:58.450> it<00:03:58.600> what<00:03:58.690> color<00:03:58.870> you'd

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
first really seeing it what color you'd

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.170 
first really seeing it what color you'd
go<00:03:59.260> so<00:03:59.920> they've<00:04:00.040> got<00:04:00.220> a<00:04:00.250> good<00:04:00.460> points<00:04:00.820> now<00:04:00.970> nice

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
go so they've got a good points now nice

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.240 
go so they've got a good points now nice
and<00:04:01.420> green<00:04:01.660> and<00:04:01.900> what<00:04:02.440> I<00:04:02.500> want<00:04:02.680> to<00:04:02.770> put<00:04:02.890> our<00:04:03.010> bad

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
and green and what I want to put our bad

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:10.620 
and green and what I want to put our bad
points<00:04:08.400> but<00:04:09.400> bad<00:04:09.850> points<00:04:10.210> have<00:04:10.330> to<00:04:10.390> press<00:04:10.540> the

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
points but bad points have to press the

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:16.770 
points but bad points have to press the
little<00:04:10.750> a<00:04:10.870> long<00:04:11.050> arrow<00:04:11.260> in<00:04:11.710> a<00:04:11.950> nice<00:04:12.720> red<00:04:15.690> so<00:04:16.690> you

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
little a long arrow in a nice red so you

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:17.550 
little a long arrow in a nice red so you
can<00:04:16.900> see<00:04:17.049> there<00:04:17.230> that's<00:04:17.350> quite

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
can see there that's quite

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.229 
can see there that's quite
straightforward<00:04:18.340> and<00:04:18.459> quite<00:04:18.640> again<00:04:19.030> quite

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
straightforward and quite again quite

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.690 
straightforward and quite again quite
easy<00:04:19.510> to<00:04:19.630> use<00:04:19.959> I<00:04:20.140> haven't<00:04:20.770> tried<00:04:20.920> reattaching

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
easy to use I haven't tried reattaching

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.370 
easy to use I haven't tried reattaching
yet<00:04:22.060> but<00:04:22.270> you<00:04:22.360> can<00:04:22.510> just<00:04:22.720> you<00:04:22.960> can<00:04:22.990> reattach

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
yet but you can just you can reattach

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.490 
yet but you can just you can reattach
there<00:04:23.920> and<00:04:24.580> if<00:04:24.820> you<00:04:24.940> come<00:04:25.150> in<00:04:25.270> here<00:04:25.570> and<00:04:26.350> then

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
there and if you come in here and then

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.860 
there and if you come in here and then
click<00:04:26.830> delete<00:04:26.980> I<00:04:27.310> can<00:04:27.550> delete<00:04:27.820> just<00:04:28.360> that<00:04:28.570> node

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
click delete I can delete just that node

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.600 
click delete I can delete just that node
so<00:04:29.440> if<00:04:29.530> I<00:04:29.590> delete<00:04:29.860> it<00:04:29.920> from<00:04:30.160> here<00:04:30.370> it<00:04:30.490> would

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
so if I delete it from here it would

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.490 
so if I delete it from here it would
delete<00:04:30.820> it<00:04:31.030> all<00:04:31.210> the<00:04:31.420> way<00:04:31.510> back<00:04:31.690> but<00:04:32.290> today

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
delete it all the way back but today

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.170 
delete it all the way back but today
just<00:04:32.530> there<00:04:32.950> then<00:04:33.430> I'll<00:04:33.550> just<00:04:33.730> delete<00:04:33.880> these

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
just there then I'll just delete these

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.360 
just there then I'll just delete these
so<00:04:34.750> altogether<00:04:35.020> really<00:04:35.560> a<00:04:35.770> really<00:04:36.190> nice

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
so altogether really a really nice

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.860 
so altogether really a really nice
really<00:04:36.730> simple<00:04:37.150> to<00:04:37.300> use<00:04:37.480> app<00:04:39.390> nothing<00:04:40.390> nothing

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
really simple to use app nothing nothing

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.860 
really simple to use app nothing nothing
too<00:04:41.080> complex<00:04:41.740> so<00:04:42.580> it<00:04:42.610> isn't<00:04:43.030> isn't<00:04:43.270> massively

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
too complex so it isn't isn't massively

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.260 
too complex so it isn't isn't massively
featured<00:04:44.350> which<00:04:44.530> might<00:04:44.800> be<00:04:45.070> um<00:04:45.370> which<00:04:46.060> might

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
featured which might be um which might

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:55.690 
featured which might be um which might
be<00:04:46.450> a<00:04:46.480> negative<00:04:46.990> so<00:04:47.620> not

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.510 

I'm<00:04:56.330> massively<00:04:56.780> featured<00:04:57.380> and<00:04:57.620> but<00:04:58.160> actually

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
I'm massively featured and but actually

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.950 
I'm massively featured and but actually
I<00:04:58.670> don't<00:04:58.760> think<00:04:59.120> that<00:04:59.270> you<00:04:59.360> necessarily<00:04:59.510> need

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
I don't think that you necessarily need

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.600 
I don't think that you necessarily need
it<00:05:00.140> to<00:05:00.440> be<00:05:00.560> massively<00:05:00.890> featured<00:05:01.250> when<00:05:01.370> you<00:05:01.460> can

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
it to be massively featured when you can

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.180 
it to be massively featured when you can
see<00:05:01.790> how<00:05:02.030> straightforward<00:05:02.390> it<00:05:02.720> is<00:05:02.870> to<00:05:03.770> you

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
see how straightforward it is to you

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.640 
see how straightforward it is to you
know<00:05:04.310> to<00:05:04.370> go<00:05:04.610> through<00:05:04.640> and<00:05:05.000> use<00:05:05.350> when<00:05:06.350> I<00:05:06.380> then

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
know to go through and use when I then

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.150 
know to go through and use when I then
come<00:05:07.070> to<00:05:07.550> sort<00:05:07.850> option<00:05:08.330> I<00:05:08.450> can<00:05:08.510> then<00:05:08.930> email<00:05:09.230> the

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
come to sort option I can then email the

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.180 
come to sort option I can then email the
mind<00:05:10.400> map<00:05:10.730> so<00:05:11.300> I<00:05:11.570> can<00:05:11.840> now<00:05:12.020> send<00:05:12.590> that<00:05:12.680> off<00:05:12.920> and

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
mind map so I can now send that off and

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.740 
mind map so I can now send that off and
I<00:05:13.340> can<00:05:13.520> send<00:05:13.730> it<00:05:13.820> off<00:05:13.910> in<00:05:14.060> different<00:05:14.360> formats

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
I can send it off in different formats

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.200 
I can send it off in different formats
so<00:05:15.500> it<00:05:15.770> supports<00:05:16.010> some<00:05:16.490> standard<00:05:16.970> mind

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
so it supports some standard mind

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.380 
so it supports some standard mind
mapping<00:05:17.540> formats<00:05:17.960> mind<00:05:18.290> node<00:05:18.680> in<00:05:19.670> free<00:05:20.120> mind

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390 
mapping formats mind node in free mind

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.360 
mapping formats mind node in free mind
but<00:05:21.080> then<00:05:21.200> you<00:05:21.260> couldn't<00:05:21.500> actually<00:05:21.650> email<00:05:22.250> it

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
but then you couldn't actually email it

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.540 
but then you couldn't actually email it
off<00:05:22.460> as<00:05:22.610> a<00:05:22.640> PNG<00:05:23.350> image<00:05:24.350> file<00:05:24.590> or<00:05:24.830> a<00:05:25.040> text

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
off as a PNG image file or a text

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:26.770 
off as a PNG image file or a text
outline<00:05:25.700> which<00:05:26.030> is<00:05:26.150> quite<00:05:26.330> nice

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
outline which is quite nice

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.180 
outline which is quite nice
so<00:05:27.170> if<00:05:27.230> we<00:05:27.320> just<00:05:27.440> have<00:05:27.500> a<00:05:27.620> look<00:05:27.710> at<00:05:27.860> text

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
so if we just have a look at text

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:29.950 
so if we just have a look at text
outline<00:05:28.310> so<00:05:28.940> it<00:05:29.030> literally<00:05:29.240> just<00:05:29.480> comes<00:05:29.660> up<00:05:29.780> as

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
outline so it literally just comes up as

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.220 
outline so it literally just comes up as
a<00:05:30.260> list<00:05:30.530> within<00:05:30.920> the<00:05:31.040> app<00:05:31.480> if<00:05:32.480> I<00:05:32.540> set<00:05:32.810> it<00:05:32.840> there

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:33.230 
a list within the app if I set it there

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.060 
a list within the app if I set it there
and<00:05:33.530> mailed<00:05:34.280> it<00:05:34.490> was<00:05:34.790> a<00:05:34.820> PNG<00:05:35.210> then<00:05:36.080> then<00:05:36.710> this

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
and mailed it was a PNG then then this

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.740 
and mailed it was a PNG then then this
really<00:05:37.340> looks<00:05:37.640> really<00:05:37.880> nice<00:05:38.030> within<00:05:38.480> the<00:05:38.630> app

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
really looks really nice within the app

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:46.030 
really looks really nice within the app
and<00:05:41.140> and<00:05:42.140> I<00:05:42.320> can<00:05:42.530> from<00:05:42.770> there<00:05:43.010> copy<00:05:44.830> say<00:05:45.830> that

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040 
and and I can from there copy say that

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:52.960 
and and I can from there copy say that
actually<00:05:50.170> yeah<00:05:51.170> copy<00:05:51.920> it<00:05:52.130> so<00:05:52.280> I<00:05:52.310> could<00:05:52.580> paste

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
actually yeah copy it so I could paste

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:53.710 
actually yeah copy it so I could paste
it<00:05:53.120> into<00:05:53.210> something<00:05:53.420> else

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 
it into something else

00:05:53.720 --> 00:06:00.130 
it into something else
there<00:05:54.080> isn't<00:05:54.200> an<00:05:54.830> option<00:05:55.370> here<00:05:55.700> to<00:05:56.270> one<00:05:57.670> to<00:05:59.140> put

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:00.140 
there isn't an option here to one to put

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.510 
there isn't an option here to one to put
it<00:06:00.200> on<00:06:00.290> clipboard<00:06:00.770> which<00:06:00.950> would<00:06:01.130> be<00:06:01.250> really

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
it on clipboard which would be really

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.820 
it on clipboard which would be really
nice<00:06:01.640> so<00:06:02.000> a<00:06:02.180> way<00:06:02.510> to<00:06:02.570> just<00:06:02.900> you<00:06:03.350> know<00:06:03.470> straight

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
nice so a way to just you know straight

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.950 
nice so a way to just you know straight
out<00:06:04.010> exports<00:06:04.610> it<00:06:04.700> to<00:06:04.790> the<00:06:04.880> clipboard<00:06:05.090> also

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 
out exports it to the clipboard also

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.170 
out exports it to the clipboard also
save<00:06:06.170> it<00:06:06.290> as<00:06:06.350> an<00:06:06.440> image<00:06:06.530> which<00:06:07.490> again<00:06:07.700> would<00:06:07.970> be

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180 
save it as an image which again would be

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.100 
save it as an image which again would be
really<00:06:08.690> nice

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
really nice

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.270 
really nice
I<00:06:09.280> can<00:06:10.280> reorganize<00:06:10.870> the<00:06:11.870> nodes<00:06:12.200> I<00:06:12.680> don't<00:06:13.220> know

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 
I can reorganize the nodes I don't know

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.260 
I can reorganize the nodes I don't know
what<00:06:13.400> that<00:06:13.490> means<00:06:13.730> to<00:06:13.880> be<00:06:13.970> honest<00:06:14.150> I've<00:06:14.210> never

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:14.270 
what that means to be honest I've never

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.510 
what that means to be honest I've never
done<00:06:14.540> it<00:06:14.690> so<00:06:14.870> just<00:06:15.590> pulling<00:06:15.860> everything<00:06:16.040> in<00:06:16.250> so

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
done it so just pulling everything in so

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.430 
done it so just pulling everything in so
everything's<00:06:16.820> a<00:06:16.910> bit<00:06:17.030> tighter<00:06:17.270> so<00:06:17.480> if<00:06:18.050> you<00:06:18.290> had

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
everything's a bit tighter so if you had

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.260 
everything's a bit tighter so if you had
lots<00:06:18.920> and<00:06:19.130> lots<00:06:19.280> going<00:06:19.550> on<00:06:19.760> then<00:06:19.940> I<00:06:19.970> think<00:06:20.150> if

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.270 
lots and lots going on then I think if

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:21.610 
lots and lots going on then I think if
we<00:06:20.360> clicked<00:06:20.600> back<00:06:20.810> here<00:06:21.080> and<00:06:21.230> real<00:06:21.350> close

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620 
we clicked back here and real close

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.920 
we clicked back here and real close
nodes<00:06:21.920> just<00:06:22.460> streamlines<00:06:23.210> everything<00:06:23.720> so

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930 
nodes just streamlines everything so

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.680 
nodes just streamlines everything so
that<00:06:24.050> you're<00:06:24.170> using<00:06:24.530> less<00:06:24.800> space<00:06:25.130> so<00:06:25.370> yeah<00:06:26.300> I'm

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:26.690 
that you're using less space so yeah I'm

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.000 
that you're using less space so yeah I'm
gonna<00:06:26.810> put<00:06:26.960> one<00:06:27.080> more<00:06:27.200> bad<00:06:27.380> point<00:06:27.650> there<00:06:27.830> which

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.010 
gonna put one more bad point there which

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:39.930 
gonna put one more bad point there which
is<00:06:28.250> no<00:06:29.470> save<00:06:31.240> image<00:06:33.790> to<00:06:34.790> iPad<00:06:36.730> or<00:06:37.730> clipboard

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:39.940 
is no save image to iPad or clipboard

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.090 

then<00:07:31.980> you'll<00:07:32.160> see<00:07:32.340> it<00:07:32.460> here<00:07:32.700> and<00:07:32.940> you'll<00:07:33.210> see

then you'll see it here and you'll see

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:38.030 
then you'll see it here and you'll see
so<00:07:35.100> my<00:07:35.430> note<00:07:35.790> here<00:07:36.120> it's<00:07:36.990> an<00:07:37.110> iPhone<00:07:37.530> app<00:07:37.830> as

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:38.040 
so my note here it's an iPhone app as

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.330 
so my note here it's an iPhone app as
well<00:07:38.250> as<00:07:38.310> a<00:07:38.460> iPad<00:07:39.300> app<00:07:39.510> and<00:07:39.920> it<00:07:40.920> costs<00:07:41.160> two

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:41.340 
well as a iPad app and it costs two

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:42.590 
well as a iPad app and it costs two
pounds<00:07:41.700> I<00:07:41.820> think<00:07:41.910> that<00:07:42.120> was<00:07:42.210> two<00:07:42.360> passports

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:42.600 
pounds I think that was two passports

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.590 
pounds I think that was two passports
you<00:07:42.870> know<00:07:42.960> I'm<00:07:43.080> just<00:07:43.140> difficult<00:07:43.350> to<00:07:43.560> see<00:07:44.600> look

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:45.600 
you know I'm just difficult to see look

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.830 
you know I'm just difficult to see look
because<00:07:46.470> three<00:07:46.860> pound<00:07:47.070> 49<00:07:47.580> so<00:07:48.090> I<00:07:48.390> mean<00:07:48.600> it's<00:07:48.750> a

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:48.840 
because three pound 49 so I mean it's a

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.080 
because three pound 49 so I mean it's a
little<00:07:49.110> bit<00:07:49.230> pricey<00:07:49.410> isn't<00:07:49.830> that<00:07:49.920> and<00:07:50.790> if<00:07:51.000> it

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:51.090 
little bit pricey isn't that and if it

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:56.150 
little bit pricey isn't that and if it
had<00:07:51.240> that<00:07:51.390> saved<00:07:52.350> to<00:07:54.200> the<00:07:55.200> iPad<00:07:55.590> version<00:07:55.620> and

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:56.160 
had that saved to the iPad version and

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.590 
had that saved to the iPad version and
that<00:07:56.250> would<00:07:56.340> be<00:07:56.460> get<00:07:56.640> better<00:07:56.850> but<00:07:57.390> to<00:07:57.510> be

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:57.600 
that would be get better but to be

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.630 
that would be get better but to be
honest<00:07:57.810> for<00:07:58.260> a<00:07:58.320> good<00:07:58.680> mind-mapping<00:07:59.160> up<00:07:59.460> like

00:07:59.630 --> 00:07:59.640 
honest for a good mind-mapping up like

honest for a good mind-mapping up like
that<00:07:59.790> I<00:07:59.850> think<00:08:00.090> that's<00:08:00.210> brilliant<00:08:00.360> that's<00:08:00.690> all

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:01.050 
that I think that's brilliant that's all

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:02.720 
that I think that's brilliant that's all
