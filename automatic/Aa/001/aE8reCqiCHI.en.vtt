00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
and their debut album like I said was

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.359 
and their debut album like I said was
released<00:01:38.299> in<00:01:38.479> 2010<00:01:38.960> and<00:01:39.320> this<00:01:39.770> is<00:01:39.920> still<00:01:40.159> kind

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
released in 2010 and this is still kind

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.969 
released in 2010 and this is still kind
of<00:01:40.549> their<00:01:40.939> debut<00:01:41.119> album<00:01:41.329> because<00:01:42.320> it's<00:01:42.619> mostly

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
of their debut album because it's mostly

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.980 
of their debut album because it's mostly
the<00:01:43.189> same<00:01:43.219> track<00:01:43.729> listing<00:01:44.240> so<00:01:44.450> I<00:01:44.479> don't<00:01:44.840> think

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
the same track listing so I don't think

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.260 
the same track listing so I don't think
it<00:01:45.079> counts<00:01:45.200> as<00:01:45.469> a<00:01:45.500> second<00:01:45.950> studio<00:01:46.219> album<00:01:46.340> but

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
it counts as a second studio album but

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.660 
it counts as a second studio album but
the<00:01:48.079> first<00:01:48.380> song<00:01:48.649> released<00:01:49.039> off<00:01:49.250> of<00:01:49.430> it<00:01:49.549> was
