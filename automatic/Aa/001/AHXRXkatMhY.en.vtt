that<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.159> little<00:01:50.340> bit<00:01:50.490> later<00:01:50.820> on<00:01:50.970> but<00:01:51.270> for<00:01:51.390> the

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
that a little bit later on but for the

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.200 
that a little bit later on but for the
time<00:01:51.720> being<00:01:52.070> using<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.159> marker<00:01:53.579> float<00:01:53.820> as<00:01:54.030> my

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
time being using the marker float as my

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.929 
time being using the marker float as my
target<00:01:54.479> I'm<00:01:55.290> gonna<00:01:55.500> put<00:01:55.740> probably<00:01:56.250> about<00:01:56.460> 50

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
target I'm gonna put probably about 50

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.020 
target I'm gonna put probably about 50
or<00:01:57.060> 60<00:01:57.270> baits<00:01:57.719> out<00:01:57.960> into<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.619> area<00:01:58.890> I'm<00:01:59.640> gonna

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
or 60 baits out into that area I'm gonna

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.209 
or 60 baits out into that area I'm gonna
fish<00:02:00.299> one<00:02:00.600> rod<00:02:00.869> directly<00:02:01.469> on<00:02:01.590> top<00:02:01.799> of<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.009> bait

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
fish one rod directly on top of the bait

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.789 
fish one rod directly on top of the bait
and<00:02:02.490> one<00:02:03.210> rod<00:02:03.450> just<00:02:03.810> off<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.380> can<00:02:04.560> often

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
and one rod just off it that can often

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.249 
and one rod just off it that can often
produce<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.310> bigger<00:02:05.520> bonus<00:02:05.790> fish<00:02:06.210> so<00:02:06.479> I'm<00:02:07.110> gonna

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
produce a bigger bonus fish so I'm gonna

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.469 
produce a bigger bonus fish so I'm gonna
have<00:02:07.439> two<00:02:07.649> rods<00:02:07.950> in<00:02:08.160> in<00:02:08.369> one<00:02:08.759> fairly<00:02:09.119> tight

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
have two rods in in one fairly tight

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.869 
have two rods in in one fairly tight
area<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.170> then<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.709> third<00:02:10.979> rod<00:02:11.280> I'm<00:02:11.580> gonna

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
area and then the third rod I'm gonna

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.850 
area and then the third rod I'm gonna
fish<00:02:12.090> way<00:02:12.660> off<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:13.080> bait

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
fish way off that bait

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.830 
fish way off that bait
probably<00:02:14.220> over<00:02:14.550> some<00:02:14.730> particles<00:02:15.360> but<00:02:15.570> I'll<00:02:15.660> do

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
probably over some particles but I'll do

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:23.060 
probably over some particles but I'll do
that<00:02:15.990> later<00:02:16.170> on<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:21.120> time<00:02:21.360> being<00:02:21.770> I'm<00:02:22.770> going

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
that later on the time being I'm going

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.990 
that later on the time being I'm going
to<00:02:23.130> use<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.430> float<00:02:23.670> as<00:02:23.820> a<00:02:23.850> target<00:02:25.100> and<00:02:26.100> I'm

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
to use the float as a target and I'm

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.940 
to use the float as a target and I'm
basically<00:02:27.450> gonna<00:02:28.790> use<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.970> catapult<00:02:30.950> I'm

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
basically gonna use the catapult I'm

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.430 
basically gonna use the catapult I'm
gonna<00:02:32.100> try<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.400> get<00:02:32.550> about<00:02:33.080> fifty<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.230> sixty

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
gonna try and get about fifty to sixty

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.630 
gonna try and get about fifty to sixty
baits<00:02:34.890> out<00:02:35.160> there

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
baits out there

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.510 
baits out there
the<00:02:36.000> conditions<00:02:36.510> are<00:02:36.660> reasonably<00:02:37.260> good<00:02:37.520> the

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
the conditions are reasonably good the

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.970 
the conditions are reasonably good the
fish<00:02:38.760> won't<00:02:39.030> have<00:02:39.240> any<00:02:39.600> problem<00:02:39.930> in<00:02:40.050> that<00:02:40.440> sort

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
fish won't have any problem in that sort

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.699 
fish won't have any problem in that sort
of<00:02:41.040> quantity<00:02:41.550> of<00:02:41.730> bait<00:02:42.290> but<00:02:43.290> I'm<00:02:43.380> not<00:02:43.530> putting

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
of quantity of bait but I'm not putting

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.990 
of quantity of bait but I'm not putting
in<00:02:43.980> so<00:02:44.220> much<00:02:44.490> that<00:02:45.920> I'm<00:02:46.920> basically<00:02:47.220> gonna<00:02:47.700> kill

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
in so much that I'm basically gonna kill

00:02:48.000 --> 00:03:14.220 
in so much that I'm basically gonna kill
my<00:02:48.180> chances

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.990 

a<00:03:14.260> lot<00:03:14.800> of<00:03:14.830> people<00:03:15.250> struggle<00:03:15.700> when<00:03:15.850> they're

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
a lot of people struggle when they're

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.230 
a lot of people struggle when they're
using<00:03:16.240> a<00:03:16.420> catapult<00:03:16.930> and<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:18.670> technique<00:03:19.060> is

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
using a catapult and the technique is

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.840 
using a catapult and the technique is
fairly<00:03:19.510> simple<00:03:19.870> just<00:03:20.080> remember<00:03:20.830> to<00:03:21.010> keep<00:03:21.190> your

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
fairly simple just remember to keep your

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.510 
fairly simple just remember to keep your
right<00:03:22.150> arm<00:03:22.710> rigid<00:03:23.710> that<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.160> arm<00:03:24.310> that's

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
right arm rigid that the arm that's

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.690 
right arm rigid that the arm that's
holding<00:03:24.910> the<00:03:25.000> catapult<00:03:26.070> grip<00:03:27.070> the<00:03:27.310> pouch<00:03:27.670> with

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
holding the catapult grip the pouch with

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.890 
holding the catapult grip the pouch with
your<00:03:28.180> left<00:03:28.390> arm

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
your left arm

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.740 
your left arm
keep<00:03:29.590> that<00:03:29.800> catapult<00:03:30.610> arm<00:03:30.880> rigid<00:03:31.360> and<00:03:31.450> then

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
keep that catapult arm rigid and then

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.820 
keep that catapult arm rigid and then
just<00:03:32.020> pull<00:03:32.650> back<00:03:32.680> on<00:03:33.100> the<00:03:33.220> elastic<00:03:33.730> I<00:03:34.740> tend<00:03:35.740> to

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
just pull back on the elastic I tend to

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.040 
just pull back on the elastic I tend to
 the<00:03:36.250> catapult<00:03:36.670> over<00:03:37.150> to<00:03:37.270> the<00:03:37.390> side<00:03:37.660> so

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
 the catapult over to the side so

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.550 
 the catapult over to the side so
our<00:03:38.080> twist<00:03:38.470> it<00:03:38.620> 90<00:03:39.010> degrees<00:03:39.900> right<00:03:40.900> arm<00:03:41.140> rigid

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
our twist it 90 degrees right arm rigid

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.590 
our twist it 90 degrees right arm rigid
left<00:03:42.370> arm<00:03:42.640> doing<00:03:42.850> all<00:03:43.030> the<00:03:43.150> work<00:03:43.330> by

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
left arm doing all the work by

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.050 
left arm doing all the work by
stretching<00:03:43.930> the<00:03:44.140> elastic<00:03:44.790> it'll<00:03:45.790> do<00:03:45.880> you<00:03:46.030> no

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
stretching the elastic it'll do you no

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.730 
stretching the elastic it'll do you no
good<00:03:46.209> whatsoever<00:03:46.750> to<00:03:47.170> actually<00:03:47.470> move<00:03:47.680> the

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
and all it will do is lose accuracy so
