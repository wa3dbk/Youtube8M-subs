00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
making tamarind ball very rarely we cook

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.950 
making tamarind ball very rarely we cook
with<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.620> but<00:00:47.000> times<00:00:48.000> have<00:00:48.120> changed

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
with it but times have changed

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.040 
with it but times have changed
so<00:00:49.140> probably<00:00:49.559> now<00:00:49.680> they're<00:00:49.920> cooking<00:00:50.309> with<00:00:50.460> it

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
so probably now they're cooking with it

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.170 
so probably now they're cooking with it
this<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.110> in<00:00:52.410> its<00:00:52.559> natural<00:00:52.800> form<00:00:53.160> see<00:00:54.680> the

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
this is in its natural form see the

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.939 
this is in its natural form see the
outside<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.390> dry<00:00:58.020> when<00:00:58.289> it's<00:00:58.440> ready<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
outside is dry when it's ready in the

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.430 
outside is dry when it's ready in the
beginning<00:00:59.340> it's<00:00:59.520> green<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.329> we<00:01:00.989> eat<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.140> that

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
beginning it's green and we eat it that

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.210 
beginning it's green and we eat it that
way<00:01:02.239> and<00:01:03.239> then<00:01:03.930> we<00:01:03.989> eat<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.500> outside<00:01:04.619> but

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
way and then we eat the outside but

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.030 
way and then we eat the outside but
usually<00:01:06.180> it's<00:01:06.479> left<00:01:06.750> on<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.080> tree<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.560> these

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
usually it's left on the tree and these

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.380 
usually it's left on the tree and these
are<00:01:08.220> huge<00:01:08.490> trees<00:01:09.080> until<00:01:10.080> it's<00:01:10.500> am<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:11.700> pod

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
are huge trees until it's am the pod

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.410 
are huge trees until it's am the pod
dries<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.220> to<00:01:14.220> get<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.490> out<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.729> crack<00:01:15.150> the

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
dries and to get it out you crack the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.700 
dries and to get it out you crack the
pod<00:01:15.630> like<00:01:15.869> this<00:01:18.860> there<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:19.890> go

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
pod like this there you go

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:33.950 
pod like this there you go
remove<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.920> shell<00:01:29.720> and<00:01:30.829> then<00:01:32.750> there's<00:01:33.750> this

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
remove the shell and then there's this

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.020 
remove the shell and then there's this
part<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.470> holds<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:34.979> together<00:01:37.549> so<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.610> pull

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
part that holds it together so you pull

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.830 
part that holds it together so you pull
that<00:01:39.180> off<00:01:40.130> discard<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.659> what

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
that off discard that and this is what

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.389 
that off discard that and this is what
you<00:01:43.020> have<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.530> you're<00:01:43.829> going<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.040> eat<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.369> like

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
until you get it all incorporated into

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.130 
until you get it all incorporated into
one<00:02:23.560> blob<00:02:24.560> and<00:02:24.799> in<00:02:24.920> the<00:02:25.010> meantime<00:02:25.220> some<00:02:25.730> of<00:02:25.879> the

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
one blob and in the meantime some of the

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.809 
one blob and in the meantime some of the
the<00:02:27.140> seeds<00:02:27.470> because<00:02:28.010> you<00:02:28.129> have<00:02:28.250> seeds<00:02:28.519> in<00:02:28.730> the

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
the seeds because you have seeds in the

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.100 
the seeds because you have seeds in the
pod<00:02:29.030> will<00:02:29.840> come<00:02:30.080> out<00:02:30.910> but<00:02:31.910> not<00:02:32.090> all<00:02:32.420> but<00:02:32.930> that's

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
pod will come out but not all but that's

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.500 
pod will come out but not all but that's
okay<00:02:33.500> you<00:02:33.530> can<00:02:33.709> leave<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.310> seeds<00:02:34.549> in<00:02:34.819> can<00:02:35.330> get

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
okay you can leave the seeds in can get

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.690 
okay you can leave the seeds in can get
rid<00:02:35.660> of<00:02:35.780> that<00:02:35.930> when<00:02:36.140> you<00:02:36.230> use<00:02:36.379> it<00:02:36.620> in<00:02:39.700> I'm

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
rid of that when you use it in I'm

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.380 
rid of that when you use it in I'm
halfway<00:02:41.390> through<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:42.079> process<00:02:42.519> but<00:02:43.519> the<00:02:43.790> our

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
halfway through the process but the our

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.809 
halfway through the process but the our
main<00:02:44.750> idea<00:02:45.440> is<00:02:45.650> to<00:02:45.680> get<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.129> pulp<00:02:46.400> from<00:02:46.489> the

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
main idea is to get the pulp from the

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.720 
main idea is to get the pulp from the
tamarind<00:02:47.090> combined<00:02:47.900> with<00:02:48.140> the<00:02:48.230> sugar<00:02:48.590> at<00:02:49.489> this

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
tamarind combined with the sugar at this

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.050 
tamarind combined with the sugar at this
point<00:02:52.209> some<00:02:53.209> people<00:02:53.239> put<00:02:53.750> on<00:02:53.810> a<00:02:54.819> little<00:02:55.819> pepper

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
point some people put on a little pepper

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.199 
point some people put on a little pepper
sauce<00:02:56.420> or<00:02:57.160> somewhere<00:02:58.160> and<00:02:58.430> put<00:02:58.579> in<00:02:58.760> some<00:02:58.970> rum

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
sauce or somewhere and put in some rum

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.970 
sauce or somewhere and put in some rum
because<00:02:59.420> I<00:02:59.660> am<00:03:00.019> not<00:03:00.260> used<00:03:00.560> to<00:03:00.709> it<00:03:00.799> being

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
because I am not used to it being

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.740 
because I am not used to it being
peppery<00:03:01.930> so<00:03:02.930> I'm<00:03:03.019> just<00:03:03.200> putting<00:03:03.500> a<00:03:03.590> little<00:03:04.750> rum

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
peppery so I'm just putting a little rum

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.360 
peppery so I'm just putting a little rum
just<00:03:05.959> to<00:03:06.170> add<00:03:06.319> moisture<00:03:08.799> like<00:03:09.799> I<00:03:09.980> said<00:03:10.220> before

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
just to add moisture like I said before

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.430 
just to add moisture like I said before
I<00:03:10.579> added<00:03:11.000> a<00:03:11.090> tablespoon<00:03:11.660> of<00:03:11.690> wrong<00:03:12.140> but<00:03:12.349> you

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
I added a tablespoon of wrong but you

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.610 
I added a tablespoon of wrong but you
could<00:03:12.620> also<00:03:12.769> add<00:03:13.040> a<00:03:13.069> tablespoon<00:03:13.760> of<00:03:13.790> water

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
could also add a tablespoon of water

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.379 
could also add a tablespoon of water
because<00:03:15.620> you<00:03:16.609> don't<00:03:16.760> want<00:03:16.910> to<00:03:17.030> give<00:03:17.150> kids

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
because you don't want to give kids

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:19.210 
because you don't want to give kids
candy<00:03:18.139> with<00:03:18.290> rum<00:03:18.680> in<00:03:18.829> it

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
candy with rum in it

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:27.370 
candy with rum in it
I<00:03:24.579> only<00:03:25.579> learn<00:03:25.849> about<00:03:25.880> this<00:03:26.419> rum<00:03:26.720> white<00:03:26.959> we<00:03:27.169> are

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
I only learn about this rum white we are

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.409 
I only learn about this rum white we are
adding<00:03:27.829> wrong<00:03:28.069> by<00:03:28.220> talking<00:03:28.700> to<00:03:28.730> other<00:03:28.849> people

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:29.419 
adding wrong by talking to other people

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:34.120 
adding wrong by talking to other people
who<00:03:29.510> have<00:03:29.660> made<00:03:29.930> it<00:03:32.380> as<00:03:33.380> you<00:03:33.530> notice<00:03:33.919> it's

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
who have made it as you notice it's

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.030 
who have made it as you notice it's
coming<00:03:34.519> together<00:03:34.730> in<00:03:35.030> a<00:03:35.060> ball<00:03:35.480> and<00:03:35.810> a<00:03:36.769> lot<00:03:37.010> of

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
coming together in a ball and a lot of

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.819 
coming together in a ball and a lot of
the<00:03:37.280> seeds<00:03:37.700> are<00:03:37.910> fall<00:03:38.150> not<00:03:38.510> which<00:03:38.750> is<00:03:38.930> the

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
the seeds are fall not which is the

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:42.699 
the seeds are fall not which is the
whole<00:03:40.010> idea<00:03:40.190> to<00:03:40.579> get<00:03:40.700> rid<00:03:40.760> of<00:03:41.389> as<00:03:41.690> much<00:03:42.139> seed<00:03:42.530> as

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
whole idea to get rid of as much seed as

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.400 
whole idea to get rid of as much seed as
well<00:03:43.430> as<00:03:43.579> incorporated<00:03:44.510> pump<00:03:44.959> from<00:03:45.260> the

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
well as incorporated pump from the

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.430 
well as incorporated pump from the
tamron<00:03:45.859> with<00:03:46.730> the<00:03:46.819> sugar<00:03:47.209> so<00:03:48.079> I'm<00:03:48.169> going<00:03:48.380> to

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
tamron with the sugar so I'm going to

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.400 
tamron with the sugar so I'm going to
add<00:03:48.590> a<00:03:48.620> little<00:03:48.919> more<00:03:49.099> sugar<00:03:49.160> and<00:03:50.260> a<00:03:51.260> little

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
add a little more sugar and a little

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.620 
add a little more sugar and a little
more<00:03:51.739> kneading<00:03:52.190> and<00:03:52.310> then<00:03:52.549> it<00:03:52.700> would<00:03:52.849> be<00:03:52.880> time

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
more kneading and then it would be time

00:03:53.630 --> 00:04:03.000 
more kneading and then it would be time
to<00:03:53.959> make<00:03:54.139> the<00:03:54.650> balls

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.050 

here<00:04:04.010> are<00:04:04.099> some<00:04:04.220> of<00:04:04.280> the<00:04:04.430> seeds<00:04:04.700> that<00:04:04.940> have

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
here are some of the seeds that have

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.680 
here are some of the seeds that have
been<00:04:05.239> removed<00:04:05.470> mm-hmm

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
been removed mm-hmm

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.780 
been removed mm-hmm
now<00:04:08.690> you're<00:04:08.840> at<00:04:08.959> the<00:04:08.989> right<00:04:09.260> consistency<00:04:09.920> the

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
now you're at the right consistency the

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.119 
now you're at the right consistency the
dough<00:04:10.970> as<00:04:11.269> you<00:04:11.450> mix<00:04:11.750> I<00:04:11.930> need<00:04:12.170> the<00:04:12.560> seeds<00:04:12.830> fall

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:13.129 
dough as you mix I need the seeds fall

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.690 
dough as you mix I need the seeds fall
out

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
out

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.449 
out
some<00:04:14.690> of<00:04:14.810> them<00:04:14.930> will<00:04:15.170> remain<00:04:15.379> and<00:04:15.799> that's<00:04:15.980> okay

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
some of them will remain and that's okay

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.490 
some of them will remain and that's okay
that's<00:04:17.299> the<00:04:17.570> consistency<00:04:19.810> and<00:04:20.810> then<00:04:21.139> we'll

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
that's the consistency and then we'll

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.340 
that's the consistency and then we'll
make<00:04:21.739> dough<00:04:22.070> make<00:04:23.030> the<00:04:23.180> ball<00:04:25.810> so<00:04:26.810> here<00:04:27.080> we<00:04:27.199> go

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
make dough make the ball so here we go

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.950 
make dough make the ball so here we go
we<00:04:27.530> have<00:04:27.590> it<00:04:27.800> all<00:04:28.120> mixed<00:04:29.120> together<00:04:29.389> with<00:04:29.780> the

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
we have it all mixed together with the

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.770 
we have it all mixed together with the
pork<00:04:30.199> with<00:04:30.410> the<00:04:30.440> sugar<00:04:31.100> and<00:04:31.940> so<00:04:32.360> I've<00:04:32.479> started

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
pork with the sugar and so I've started

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.689 
pork with the sugar and so I've started
making<00:04:33.110> the<00:04:33.380> balls<00:04:33.590> I<00:04:33.830> have<00:04:33.949> a<00:04:33.979> small<00:04:34.400> plate

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
making the balls I have a small plate

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:38.020 
making the balls I have a small plate
with<00:04:35.229> with<00:04:36.229> some<00:04:36.440> sugar<00:04:36.770> in<00:04:37.070> it<00:04:37.250> so<00:04:37.460> you're

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
with with some sugar in it so you're

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.150 
with with some sugar in it so you're
just<00:04:38.180> going<00:04:38.419> to<00:04:38.510> have<00:04:38.660> that<00:04:38.870> to<00:04:39.500> roll<00:04:39.740> the<00:04:40.130> ball

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
just going to have that to roll the ball

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:47.469 
just going to have that to roll the ball
and<00:04:40.669> cover<00:04:41.539> them<00:04:41.810> with<00:04:41.840> sugar<00:04:46.210> it's<00:04:47.210> really

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 
and cover them with sugar it's really

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:49.180 
and cover them with sugar it's really
the<00:04:47.630> type<00:04:47.810> of<00:04:47.840> recipe<00:04:48.289> where<00:04:48.620> you<00:04:48.800> just<00:04:48.979> kind

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
the type of recipe where you just kind

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.070 
the type of recipe where you just kind
of<00:04:49.280> feel<00:04:49.820> it<00:04:50.000> out<00:04:50.180> yeah<00:04:50.539> have<00:04:50.720> to<00:04:50.930> necessarily

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
of feel it out yeah have to necessarily

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.420 
of feel it out yeah have to necessarily
measure<00:04:51.710> the<00:04:52.150> amounts<00:04:53.150> you<00:04:53.660> just<00:04:53.979> kind<00:04:54.979> of<00:04:55.039> put

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
measure the amounts you just kind of put

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.279 
measure the amounts you just kind of put
enough<00:04:55.699> sugar<00:04:55.970> and<00:04:56.479> through<00:04:57.080> it<00:04:57.260> until<00:04:59.289> it

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:00.289 
enough sugar and through it until it

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:02.830 
enough sugar and through it until it
kind<00:05:00.470> of<00:05:00.590> comes<00:05:00.830> together<00:05:01.010> that's<00:05:01.970> long<00:05:02.360> add<00:05:02.810> a

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
kind of comes together that's long add a

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.620 
kind of comes together that's long add a
little<00:05:03.110> water<00:05:03.380> or<00:05:04.210> if<00:05:05.210> you<00:05:05.300> know<00:05:05.389> that<00:05:05.539> you're

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
little water or if you know that you're

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:06.969 
little water or if you know that you're
going<00:05:05.720> to<00:05:05.780> stir<00:05:05.930> them<00:05:06.050> to<00:05:06.200> dulse<00:05:06.440> you<00:05:06.740> can<00:05:06.889> add

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:06.979 
going to stir them to dulse you can add

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:10.990 
going to stir them to dulse you can add
the<00:05:07.130> rum<00:05:07.370> like<00:05:07.820> we<00:05:08.030> did<00:05:09.340> Sam<00:05:10.340> rolling<00:05:10.700> them<00:05:10.849> in

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
the rum like we did Sam rolling them in

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.480 
the rum like we did Sam rolling them in
the<00:05:11.090> sugar<00:05:11.270> and<00:05:11.660> they<00:05:11.840> are<00:05:12.280> initially<00:05:13.280> they

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
the sugar and they are initially they

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.219 
the sugar and they are initially they
absorbed<00:05:14.030> that<00:05:14.150> sugar<00:05:14.479> so<00:05:14.720> when<00:05:14.870> I<00:05:14.900> have<00:05:15.080> them

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
absorbed that sugar so when I have them

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:19.200 
absorbed that sugar so when I have them
all<00:05:15.289> done<00:05:15.680> I'll<00:05:15.919> put<00:05:16.340> more<00:05:16.520> sugar<00:05:16.550> over<00:05:17.169> okay

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
all done I'll put more sugar over okay

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.850 
all done I'll put more sugar over okay
these<00:05:20.210> are<00:05:20.450> the<00:05:20.479> time<00:05:20.750> when<00:05:20.960> ball<00:05:21.200> timing
