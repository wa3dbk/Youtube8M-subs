00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:40.309
 and the explorer triumph in addition to the 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.199
 technical solutions that contributes very 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.199
 important as for example the control 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:46.809
 Cruising the traction control 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:48.949
 disconnectable and the abs disconnectable 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.460
 still using the transmission by 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:54.589
 gimbal that everyone roughly 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.479
 is employing has a bit of 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:59.180
 preload regulation quite comfortable 

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:00.710
 when you carry luggage or passenger but 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.970
 of all that of all that we have 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.440
 tried what we liked the most 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.440
 been the character of the engine 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.950
 is 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.829
 is the most powerful of the trail and from 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.930
 then the power antenna on bass and 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:25.500
 media is devastating much better than 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.500
 any other 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:32.790
 the behavior of the explorer 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.580
 it really has surprised me a lot 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.899
 because a priori there was good I had 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.530
 obsessed a bit with the subject of weight 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:44.049
 but that figure of 200 almost 60 does not 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:48.310
 they notice at all running is a motorbike 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:49.980
 super agile very fast easy to put in 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.930
 curve 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.400
 and it works very well at suspension level 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.400
 the brakes meet 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.560
 before we say goodbye just tell you 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.259
 that the explorer is a model that 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.030
 truth is that I advise inside the event 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.740
 de es maxi trail and it has been the last 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.380
 to arrive and of course it is in the 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.870
 top places 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.020
 with a price figure equal to the 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.910
 competition and it is clear that knowing 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.700
 make trios in recent years it 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.070
 let's notice by completing a trail range 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.700
 very very effective together with the 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.890
 other 800 tiger and the 1050 workshop so 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.400
 from here a greeting to all followers 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.400
 and bikers
