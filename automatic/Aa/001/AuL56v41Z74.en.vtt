making<00:00:25.780> fudge<00:00:26.410> the<00:00:26.740> ultimate<00:00:27.280> fudge<00:00:27.550> recipe

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
making fudge the ultimate fudge recipe

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.269 
making fudge the ultimate fudge recipe
things<00:00:28.869> you<00:00:28.990> only<00:00:29.080> have<00:00:29.200> four<00:00:29.440> ingredients<00:00:29.470> so

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:30.279 
things you only have four ingredients so

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.110 
things you only have four ingredients so
we<00:00:30.369> have<00:00:30.550> milk<00:00:31.410> condensed<00:00:32.410> milk<00:00:32.730> butter<00:00:33.730> and

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
we have milk condensed milk butter and

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.900 
we have milk condensed milk butter and
terminal<00:00:35.020> sugar<00:00:35.230> that's<00:00:35.770> it<00:00:36.100> why<00:00:36.670> does<00:00:36.879> a

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
terminal sugar that's it why does a

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.390 
terminal sugar that's it why does a
saucepan<00:00:37.420> the<00:00:37.690> easier<00:00:38.140> it<00:00:38.230> is<00:00:38.320> to<00:00:38.379> cook<00:00:38.739> by

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
saucepan the easier it is to cook by

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.369 
saucepan the easier it is to cook by
that<00:00:39.580> I<00:00:39.610> mean<00:00:39.879> there's<00:00:40.330> a<00:00:40.420> wider<00:00:40.629> surface<00:00:41.020> area

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
that I mean there's a wider surface area

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:43.770 
that I mean there's a wider surface area
so<00:00:41.710> you<00:00:41.800> kind<00:00:42.040> of<00:00:42.100> stir<00:00:42.280> the<00:00:42.540> mixture<00:00:43.540> a<00:00:43.660> lot

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
so you kind of stir the mixture a lot

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.390 
so you kind of stir the mixture a lot
easier<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:45.670> first<00:00:45.879> of<00:00:45.970> all<00:00:46.059> put<00:00:46.690> your<00:00:46.809> milks

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400 
easier so first of all put your milks

00:00:47.400 --> 00:01:03.660 
easier so first of all put your milks
into<00:00:48.400> the<00:00:48.910> pan<00:00:49.590> just<00:00:50.590> like<00:00:50.800> that<00:01:00.630> just<00:01:02.520> he<00:01:03.520> was

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
into the pan just like that just he was

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.840 
into the pan just like that just he was
sugar<00:01:04.000> in<00:01:04.809> the<00:01:05.290> middle<00:01:05.560> of<00:01:05.619> the<00:01:05.740> pan<00:01:06.009> so<00:01:06.729> the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
sugar in the middle of the pan so the

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.310 
sugar in the middle of the pan so the
liquid<00:01:07.030> is<00:01:07.240> on<00:01:07.330> the<00:01:07.420> outside<00:01:07.780> and<00:01:08.110> what<00:01:08.259> we

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
liquid is on the outside and what we

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.609 
liquid is on the outside and what we
need<00:01:08.440> to<00:01:08.470> do<00:01:08.710> is<00:01:08.950> over<00:01:09.250> gentle<00:01:09.880> heat<00:01:10.619> is

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
need to do is over gentle heat is

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.430 
need to do is over gentle heat is
dissolve<00:01:12.220> the<00:01:12.430> sugar<00:01:12.840> now<00:01:13.840> if<00:01:13.990> at<00:01:14.170> any<00:01:14.320> point

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
dissolve the sugar now if at any point

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.469 
dissolve the sugar now if at any point
this<00:01:14.950> sugar<00:01:15.280> gets<00:01:15.430> on<00:01:15.580> the<00:01:15.670> outside<00:01:16.149> of<00:01:16.390> the

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
this sugar gets on the outside of the

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.050 
this sugar gets on the outside of the
pan<00:01:16.750> before<00:01:17.530> it<00:01:17.590> starts<00:01:18.100> to<00:01:18.160> dissolve<00:01:18.310> what

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
pan before it starts to dissolve what

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.150 
pan before it starts to dissolve what
happened<00:01:19.330> is<00:01:19.390> it<00:01:19.479> recrystallizes<00:01:20.290> and<00:01:20.800> drops

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
happened is it recrystallizes and drops

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.460 
happened is it recrystallizes and drops
back<00:01:21.399> into<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:21.820> mixture<00:01:22.119> that<00:01:22.780> will<00:01:22.929> make<00:01:23.110> the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
back into the mixture that will make the

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.889 
back into the mixture that will make the
fudge<00:01:23.830> go<00:01:24.069> grainy<00:01:24.429> a<00:01:24.789> lot<00:01:25.030> quicker<00:01:25.390> and<00:01:25.780> it

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
fudge go grainy a lot quicker and it

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:28.800 
fudge go grainy a lot quicker and it
won't<00:01:26.080> cook<00:01:26.259> correctly<00:01:26.709> so<00:01:27.459> just<00:01:28.000> bring<00:01:28.720> this

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
won't cook correctly so just bring this

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.300 
won't cook correctly so just bring this
together<00:01:29.940> and<00:01:30.940> gently<00:01:31.840> stir<00:01:32.140> that<00:01:32.380> until<00:01:32.709> but

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
together and gently stir that until but

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.730 
together and gently stir that until but
all<00:01:33.550> the<00:01:33.789> mists<00:01:33.970> have<00:01:34.119> dissolved<00:01:34.619> what<00:01:35.619> you

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
all the mists have dissolved what you

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.699 
all the mists have dissolved what you
must<00:01:36.069> do<00:01:36.369> is<00:01:37.240> keep<00:01:37.600> the<00:01:37.810> mixture<00:01:38.020> moving<00:01:38.590> all

00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:38.709 
must do is keep the mixture moving all

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:39.840 
must do is keep the mixture moving all
the<00:01:38.800> time<00:01:38.830> remember<00:01:39.069> is<00:01:39.310> quite<00:01:39.459> an<00:01:39.550> intense

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
the time remember is quite an intense

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.699 
the time remember is quite an intense
heat<00:01:40.060> there<00:01:40.300> they<00:01:40.899> can<00:01:41.080> hear<00:01:41.289> the<00:01:41.440> sugar

00:01:41.699 --> 00:01:41.709 
heat there they can hear the sugar

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:44.790 
heat there they can hear the sugar
underneath<00:01:42.300> so<00:01:43.300> just<00:01:43.690> keep<00:01:44.350> the<00:01:44.500> whole<00:01:44.770> thing

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
underneath so just keep the whole thing

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.300 
underneath so just keep the whole thing
moving<00:01:45.520> if<00:01:45.700> you<00:01:45.819> don't<00:01:46.140> what<00:01:47.140> happen<00:01:47.619> is<00:01:47.770> this

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
moving if you don't what happen is this

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.820 
moving if you don't what happen is this
should<00:01:48.550> will<00:01:48.670> catch<00:01:48.970> into<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.420> places<00:01:49.660> and<00:01:50.080> of

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
should will catch into the places and of

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.800 
should will catch into the places and of
the<00:01:51.009> bird<00:01:51.220> bits<00:01:51.459> will<00:01:51.610> come<00:01:51.729> through<00:01:51.880> so<00:01:52.209> just

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
the bird bits will come through so just

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.499 
the bird bits will come through so just
keep<00:01:53.289> that<00:01:53.319> moving<00:01:53.860> over<00:01:54.069> low<00:01:54.250> heat<00:01:54.420> until<00:01:55.420> you

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
keep that moving over low heat until you

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.160 
keep that moving over low heat until you
can't<00:01:55.750> hear<00:01:55.929> that<00:01:56.050> sound<00:01:57.929> now<00:01:58.929> at<00:01:59.020> this<00:01:59.110> stage

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
can't hear that sound now at this stage

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.800 
can't hear that sound now at this stage
you<00:02:00.090> can<00:02:01.090> hear<00:02:01.330> that<00:02:01.390> the<00:02:01.479> sugars<00:02:01.780> dissolved

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
you can hear that the sugars dissolved

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.550 
you can hear that the sugars dissolved
you<00:02:02.289> can't<00:02:02.500> hear<00:02:02.619> that<00:02:02.770> anymore

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
you can't hear that anymore

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.740 
you can't hear that anymore
you<00:02:03.860> can<00:02:04.009> use<00:02:04.220> the<00:02:04.700> spatula<00:02:04.970> Gosselaar<00:02:05.540> pan

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
you can use the spatula Gosselaar pan

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.539 
you can use the spatula Gosselaar pan
and<00:02:06.140> as<00:02:06.500> you<00:02:06.619> can<00:02:06.740> see<00:02:06.979> their<00:02:07.159> mixture<00:02:07.460> is

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
and as you can see their mixture is

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.280 
and as you can see their mixture is
quite<00:02:07.820> runny<00:02:09.099> but<00:02:10.099> if<00:02:10.220> you're<00:02:10.369> not<00:02:10.580> careful<00:02:11.290> if

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
quite runny but if you're not careful if

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.410 
quite runny but if you're not careful if
you<00:02:12.440> don't<00:02:12.590> keep<00:02:12.770> scraping<00:02:13.250> them<00:02:13.610> all<00:02:13.940> of<00:02:14.330> the

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
you don't keep scraping them all of the

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.729 
you don't keep scraping them all of the
pan<00:02:14.630> root<00:02:15.380> areas<00:02:15.860> will<00:02:16.520> catch<00:02:16.819> slightly<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:18.590> a

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
pan root areas will catch slightly and a

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.220 
pan root areas will catch slightly and a
little<00:02:19.040> tiny<00:02:19.190> dark<00:02:19.640> spots<00:02:20.120> in<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:20.959> finish

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
little tiny dark spots in the finish

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.589 
little tiny dark spots in the finish
fudge<00:02:21.500> so<00:02:21.830> just<00:02:22.700> keep<00:02:22.910> an<00:02:23.060> eye<00:02:23.180> on<00:02:23.209> it<00:02:23.390> and<00:02:23.480> this

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
fudge so just keep an eye on it and this

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.530 
fudge so just keep an eye on it and this
is<00:02:23.720> quite<00:02:24.019> a<00:02:24.050> hot<00:02:24.380> no<00:02:24.950> I<00:02:25.340> need<00:02:25.940> to<00:02:25.970> get<00:02:26.150> it<00:02:26.209> up<00:02:26.360> to

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
is quite a hot no I need to get it up to

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.170 
is quite a hot no I need to get it up to
an<00:02:26.630> even<00:02:26.810> boil<00:02:27.319> so<00:02:27.950> all<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.370> pan<00:02:28.580> is<00:02:28.730> is

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
an even boil so all the pan is is

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.690 
an even boil so all the pan is is
boiling<00:02:29.569> not<00:02:29.870> just<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.200> edge<00:02:30.459> now<00:02:31.459> this<00:02:31.610> has

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
boiling not just the edge now this has

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.660 
boiling not just the edge now this has
been<00:02:31.880> boiling<00:02:32.090> for<00:02:32.209> about<00:02:33.550> seven<00:02:34.550> or<00:02:34.580> eight

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
been boiling for about seven or eight

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.309 
been boiling for about seven or eight
minutes<00:02:34.880> and<00:02:35.209> you<00:02:35.300> can<00:02:35.390> see<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.780> texture<00:02:36.170> is

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
minutes and you can see the texture is

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.320 
minutes and you can see the texture is
changing<00:02:36.830> it's<00:02:37.069> almost<00:02:37.310> almost<00:02:37.700> like<00:02:37.910> a<00:02:37.940> lava

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
changing it's almost almost like a lava

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.350 
changing it's almost almost like a lava
now<00:02:38.750> rather<00:02:38.989> than<00:02:39.080> a<00:02:39.230> liquid<00:02:39.790> at<00:02:40.790> this<00:02:41.030> point

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
now rather than a liquid at this point

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.850 
now rather than a liquid at this point
you<00:02:41.600> could<00:02:41.690> be<00:02:41.810> very<00:02:42.049> careful<00:02:42.500> to<00:02:42.590> cut<00:02:42.739> your

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
you could be very careful to cut your

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.610 
you could be very careful to cut your
hands<00:02:43.040> or<00:02:43.280> your<00:02:43.370> skin<00:02:44.049> it<00:02:45.049> will<00:02:45.260> burn<00:02:45.470> you

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
hands or your skin it will burn you

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.080 
hands or your skin it will burn you
pretty<00:02:45.830> quickly<00:02:46.100> but<00:02:46.760> long<00:02:46.880> as<00:02:46.970> you're

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
pretty quickly but long as you're

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.940 
pretty quickly but long as you're
careful<00:02:47.209> and<00:02:47.630> just<00:02:48.110> stir<00:02:48.440> it<00:02:48.470> gently<00:02:48.680> you'll

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
careful and just stir it gently you'll

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.160 
careful and just stir it gently you'll
be<00:02:49.040> absolutely<00:02:49.310> fine<00:02:49.489> now<00:02:49.880> the<00:02:50.239> motor<00:02:50.450> test<00:02:50.840> if

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
be absolutely fine now the motor test if

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.870 
be absolutely fine now the motor test if
it's<00:02:51.319> ready

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
it's ready

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.620 
it's ready
the<00:02:52.880> little<00:02:53.230> spoonful<00:02:54.400> and<00:02:55.400> just<00:02:56.209> drop<00:02:56.510> it

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
the little spoonful and just drop it

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.210 
the little spoonful and just drop it
into<00:02:56.720> some<00:02:56.959> iced<00:02:57.200> water<00:02:58.720> just<00:02:59.720> like<00:02:59.900> that

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
into some iced water just like that

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.440 
into some iced water just like that
that'll<00:03:01.220> sink<00:03:02.380> and<00:03:03.380> it<00:03:03.470> will<00:03:03.590> set<00:03:04.010> a<00:03:04.819> few

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
that'll sink and it will set a few

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.910 
that'll sink and it will set a few
seconds<00:03:05.930> and<00:03:06.230> I'll<00:03:06.319> show<00:03:06.560> you<00:03:06.650> that<00:03:06.739> in<00:03:06.860> a

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
seconds and I'll show you that in a

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.590 
seconds and I'll show you that in a
second<00:03:08.200> in<00:03:09.200> the<00:03:09.320> meantime<00:03:10.209> take<00:03:11.209> it<00:03:11.359> off<00:03:11.450> the

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
second in the meantime take it off the

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.430 
second in the meantime take it off the
heat<00:03:11.720> off<00:03:12.260> on<00:03:12.500> a<00:03:12.530> board<00:03:14.049> gently<00:03:15.049> beat<00:03:15.290> the

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
heat off on a board gently beat the

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.530 
heat off on a board gently beat the
mixture<00:03:15.650> now<00:03:16.070> for<00:03:16.700> about<00:03:16.760> eight<00:03:17.299> to<00:03:17.510> nine

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
mixture now for about eight to nine

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:25.010 
mixture now for about eight to nine
minutes<00:03:18.190> so<00:03:19.190> the<00:03:19.280> whole<00:03:19.430> thing<00:03:19.640> thickens<00:03:20.090> up

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.660 

it's<00:03:26.020> still<00:03:26.200> actually<00:03:26.350> quite<00:03:26.709> hot<00:03:26.950> but<00:03:27.220> that

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
it's still actually quite hot but that

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.170 
it's still actually quite hot but that
is<00:03:27.880> what<00:03:28.000> we<00:03:28.090> call<00:03:28.330> in<00:03:28.540> Chevy<00:03:28.930> terms<00:03:29.700> soft<00:03:30.700> ball

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
is what we call in Chevy terms soft ball

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.840 
is what we call in Chevy terms soft ball
sugar<00:03:31.569> and<00:03:32.140> that<00:03:32.290> means<00:03:32.530> that<00:03:33.190> that<00:03:33.370> setting

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
sugar and that means that that setting

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.510 
sugar and that means that that setting
point<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.480> fudge<00:03:34.690> is<00:03:34.840> perfect<00:03:35.410> if<00:03:36.190> the

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
point the fudge is perfect if the

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.910 
point the fudge is perfect if the
mixtures<00:03:36.910> not<00:03:37.090> at<00:03:37.209> that<00:03:37.330> point<00:03:37.660> slightly<00:03:38.650> run

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
mixtures not at that point slightly run

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.170 
mixtures not at that point slightly run
yet<00:03:39.069> it<00:03:39.160> slips<00:03:39.370> through<00:03:39.520> your<00:03:39.580> fingers<00:03:39.670> into

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
yet it slips through your fingers into

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.720 
yet it slips through your fingers into
the<00:03:40.239> ice<00:03:40.500> pan<00:03:41.500> back<00:03:41.680> on<00:03:41.830> a<00:03:41.860> stove<00:03:42.130> and<00:03:42.520> give<00:03:42.670> it

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
the ice pan back on a stove and give it

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:43.979 
the ice pan back on a stove and give it
another<00:03:42.790> three<00:03:43.060> or<00:03:43.090> four<00:03:43.209> minutes<00:03:43.630> and<00:03:43.810> just

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
another three or four minutes and just

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.140 
another three or four minutes and just
keep<00:03:44.410> testing<00:03:44.620> it<00:03:44.920> and<00:03:45.190> it<00:03:45.580> will<00:03:45.670> end<00:03:45.790> up<00:03:45.910> just

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
keep testing it and it will end up just

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.820 
keep testing it and it will end up just
like<00:03:46.360> that<00:03:46.630> as<00:03:47.319> you<00:03:47.560> can<00:03:47.709> see<00:03:49.230> it's<00:03:50.230> changed

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
like that as you can see it's changed

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.530 
like that as you can see it's changed
completely<00:03:51.160> and<00:03:51.550> it<00:03:51.610> started<00:03:52.000> to<00:03:52.060> go<00:03:52.239> quite

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
completely and it started to go quite

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.150 
completely and it started to go quite
dull<00:03:52.870> and<00:03:52.900> matte<00:03:53.260> that's<00:03:53.770> what<00:03:53.890> we're<00:03:54.010> after

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
dull and matte that's what we're after

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.449 
dull and matte that's what we're after
see<00:03:54.850> that<00:03:54.970> shiny<00:03:55.330> is<00:03:55.480> going<00:03:56.100> we're<00:03:57.100> not<00:03:57.160> far

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
see that shiny is going we're not far

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.020 
see that shiny is going we're not far
away<00:03:57.580> in<00:03:57.700> a<00:03:57.940> beach<00:03:59.580> as<00:04:00.580> you<00:04:00.670> can<00:04:00.790> see<00:04:00.910> it's

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
away in a beach as you can see it's

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.540 
away in a beach as you can see it's
thickened<00:04:01.450> up<00:04:01.540> as<00:04:01.720> well<00:04:01.950> after<00:04:02.950> 8<00:04:03.250> to<00:04:03.400> 10

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
thickened up as well after 8 to 10

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:04.670 
thickened up as well after 8 to 10
minutes<00:04:03.790> the<00:04:03.850> whole<00:04:03.970> thing<00:04:04.180> comes<00:04:04.390> together

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
minutes the whole thing comes together

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.309 
minutes the whole thing comes together
and<00:04:05.680> it<00:04:05.860> that's<00:04:06.459> about<00:04:06.640> perfect<00:04:07.209> at<00:04:08.140> this

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
and it that's about perfect at this

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.380 
and it that's about perfect at this
stage<00:04:08.680> add<00:04:09.370> your<00:04:09.610> flavorings<00:04:10.060> are<00:04:10.180> still

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
stage add your flavorings are still

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.940 
stage add your flavorings are still
ginger<00:04:10.870> or<00:04:10.989> your<00:04:11.140> nuts<00:04:11.350> with<00:04:11.470> your<00:04:11.590> chocolate

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
ginger or your nuts with your chocolate

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.690 
ginger or your nuts with your chocolate
whatever<00:04:12.130> and<00:04:12.700> just<00:04:13.030> fold<00:04:13.330> it<00:04:13.450> through<00:04:14.700> and

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
whatever and just fold it through and

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:22.790 
whatever and just fold it through and
that<00:04:15.850> is<00:04:15.970> perfect<00:04:17.340> transfer<00:04:18.340> it<00:04:19.140> into<00:04:20.140> a

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.500 

parchment<00:04:23.800> lined<00:04:23.830> tin<00:04:24.400> and<00:04:24.940> this<00:04:25.210> is<00:04:25.389> the

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
parchment lined tin and this is the

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.260 
parchment lined tin and this is the
advantage<00:04:26.050> of<00:04:26.139> using<00:04:26.200> a<00:04:26.710> nonstick<00:04:27.340> pan<00:04:27.610> also

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.040 

that's<00:04:31.270> it<00:04:32.550> comes<00:04:33.550> out

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
that's it comes out

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.790 
that's it comes out
relatively<00:04:35.830> few<00:04:35.919> which<00:04:36.550> is<00:04:36.639> quite<00:04:36.789> good<00:04:37.800> just

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
relatively few which is quite good just

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.779 
relatively few which is quite good just
spread<00:04:39.129> that<00:04:39.250> around

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:41.789 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:50.690 

it's<00:04:42.789> your<00:04:43.000> baking<00:04:43.449> parchment<00:04:45.479> I'll<00:04:46.479> end<00:04:46.780> up

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.340 

and<00:04:51.120> if<00:04:51.570> you<00:04:51.690> want<00:04:51.840> to<00:04:51.900> just<00:04:51.990> Pat<00:04:52.170> it<00:04:52.260> down

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
and if you want to just Pat it down

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.990 
and if you want to just Pat it down
anything<00:04:52.560> as<00:04:52.770> you<00:04:52.860> can<00:04:53.100> that's<00:04:53.580> about<00:04:53.760> perfect

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
anything as you can that's about perfect

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.570
