individually<00:00:38.479> dried<00:00:38.750> ingredients<00:00:39.409> in<00:00:39.530> there

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.430 

you<00:00:47.059> can<00:00:47.210> use<00:00:47.390> warm<00:00:47.659> water<00:00:47.720> straight<00:00:48.199> out<00:00:48.379> of

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
you can use warm water straight out of

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.469 
you can use warm water straight out of
your<00:00:48.650> faucet<00:00:48.949> depending<00:00:49.610> on<00:00:49.699> where<00:00:49.850> you<00:00:49.970> live

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:50.479 
your faucet depending on where you live

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:53.100 
your faucet depending on where you live
I<00:00:50.510> actually<00:00:50.989> prefer<00:00:51.320> to<00:00:51.530> use<00:00:51.799> filtered<00:00:52.280> water

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
I actually prefer to use filtered water

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.600 
I actually prefer to use filtered water
so<00:00:54.110> once<00:00:54.290> the<00:00:54.440> water<00:00:54.470> is<00:00:54.799> in<00:00:55.010> initially<00:00:55.460> it

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
so once the water is in initially it

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.149 
so once the water is in initially it
will<00:00:55.670> resemble<00:00:56.030> soup<00:00:56.540> and<00:00:57.080> all<00:00:57.769> you<00:00:57.979> do<00:00:58.129> is

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:58.159 
will resemble soup and all you do is

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:00.700 
will resemble soup and all you do is
give<00:00:58.489> it<00:00:58.519> a<00:00:58.670> really<00:00:58.909> good<00:00:58.940> stir<00:00:59.449> to<00:00:59.839> combine

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
give it a really good stir to combine

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.320 
give it a really good stir to combine
all<00:01:01.159> the<00:01:01.250> ingredients<00:01:01.280> thoroughly<00:01:01.909> with<00:01:02.299> the

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:02.330 
all the ingredients thoroughly with the

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.689 
all the ingredients thoroughly with the
water<00:01:02.629> and<00:01:02.989> then<00:01:03.379> let<00:01:03.589> it<00:01:03.619> sit<00:01:04.010> for<00:01:04.040> about<00:01:04.250> five

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
water and then let it sit for about five

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.899 
water and then let it sit for about five
minutes<00:01:05.650> and<00:01:06.650> it<00:01:06.920> will<00:01:07.100> thicken<00:01:07.310> up<00:01:07.549> to<00:01:07.760> about

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
minutes and it will thicken up to about

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.060 
minutes and it will thicken up to about
a<00:01:07.970> stew<00:01:08.479> or<00:01:08.720> an<00:01:08.810> oatmeal<00:01:09.020> consistency<00:01:09.950> it's

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
a stew or an oatmeal consistency it's

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.859 
a stew or an oatmeal consistency it's
very<00:01:10.250> similar<00:01:10.579> to<00:01:10.850> making<00:01:11.000> something<00:01:11.479> like<00:01:11.689> an

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
very similar to making something like an

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:13.749 
very similar to making something like an
instant<00:01:12.200> cup<00:01:12.469> noodle<00:01:12.890> something<00:01:13.430> like<00:01:13.549> that

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
instant cup noodle something like that

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:15.940 
instant cup noodle something like that
it's<00:01:13.939> really<00:01:14.420> no<00:01:14.570> more<00:01:14.810> tricky<00:01:15.619> than<00:01:15.770> that

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
it's really no more tricky than that

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:26.069 
it's really no more tricky than that
even<00:01:16.729> husbands<00:01:17.119> can<00:01:17.359> do<00:01:17.509> it<00:01:24.700> okay

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:26.079 
even husbands can do it okay

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:28.510 
even husbands can do it okay
so<00:01:27.079> you<00:01:27.140> can<00:01:27.409> see<00:01:27.590> it's<00:01:27.740> thickened<00:01:28.100> up<00:01:28.219> quite<00:01:28.490> a

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
so you can see it's thickened up quite a

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:41.720 
so you can see it's thickened up quite a
lot<00:01:28.820> it's<00:01:29.719> just<00:01:29.960> about<00:01:30.170> ready<00:01:30.350> to<00:01:30.590> serve

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.670 

and<00:01:41.850> if<00:01:42.450> you've<00:01:42.630> made<00:01:42.660> the<00:01:42.990> food<00:01:43.200> properly
