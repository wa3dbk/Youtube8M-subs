 Muscovite Izh 412 028 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.969

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:18.020

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.359

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:25.050

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:52.739
 but I had one cant what I have 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.960
 two right turn signals just one 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.710

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.109

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:13.280
 right stuck on the left that is 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:15.509
 wrong made glass seals 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:20.100
 painted black 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:24.380
 put on the details made wipers let's 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:28.500
 side view of the model on the wing 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:31.829
 neatly painted turn signal wheels 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.560
 completely painted in silver 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:38.369
 with caps though caps can 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.700
 It was done with silver 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:46.460
 chrome much better would 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:49.220
 looked and individual also dyed 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:55.140
 door handles 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:59.270
 in black, although Muscovite izh 412 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:02.820
 chrome handles are just as 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:07.500
 plastic seals black color 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:10.300
 were here of course wrong but everyone 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.590
 equal though 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:17.170
 we tried to paint them especially 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:21.390
 I was pleased with the ass hedgehog 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:26.980
 so that painted on the sector 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:29.200
 headlights and Muscovite 412 red and for 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.860
 client, they were not painted on 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.150
 sector 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:37.810
 just were red that is here 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:40.540
 they are made much better prettier what 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.520
 gives credibility to the model also 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:51.570
 gum black painted on the bumper and 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:55.870
 There is a label Muscovite 412 on the trunk 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:59.400
 let's eat well and glass seal too 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:05.860
 black paint prokras let's see 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:09.070
 bottom of the model days of the model 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.670
 did a very good muffler have 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:16.630
 driveshaft and bridge and everything else 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:21.610
 even made 4 mud flaps 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:26.040
 On Moskvich 412 from cars legends were until 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:29.310
 back and figurative centuries of the front they were not 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:33.730
 everything is done very well 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:36.520
 then let's see the rear mirrors 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.970
 they also made a separate part 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.680
 but for some reason they are very bent and I do not 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.760
 I know of course fallen 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:50.200
 but they are made quite neatly and 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:53.489
 well, and even here it will probably be bad 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:59.140
 it can be seen from behind even they are painted and 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:04:02.260
 silver silver that is to neither 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:06.310
 what semi model is a friend still 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:11.080
 there was only this and that 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:16.390
 a huge plus of this model neatly 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:18.400
 also the moldings here are painted 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:22.210
 silver ipod 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:26.350
 and windows in the doors and here in the back 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:28.690
 Wing Salon I was also very pleased 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:34.210
 made everything believable and 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:36.930
 that is, the interior is the same all plastic 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.930
 which one 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:42.699
 412 tehad 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:48.370
 because in those when they already did all of 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:53.260
 plastic as well as the Volga 2410 already 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:56.020
 replaced in the eighties by all of 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:59.830
 plastic and journey then it was fashionable so 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:03.570
 Already chrome did less and safe 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:08.490
 pens set that is not like on 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:16.169
 the previous ones and the ones that are similar to convey to 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:16.169
 408 Muscovite everything was already redone 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:25.919
 I was very pleased with the model 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:30.550
 neatly good and even some cons 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:34.419
 which were not exactly 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.380
 Muscovite 412 who was before him in 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:39.909
 customers 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:43.830
 that is, all these cons were removed in 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:49.080
 and 412 I really liked the model 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:49.080
 thanks everyone for watching goodbye
