00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
back as well at last year how do you

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.770 
back as well at last year how do you
think<00:00:41.129> this<00:00:41.309> roster<00:00:41.790> compares<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.480> roster

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
think this roster compares to the roster

think this roster compares to the roster
you<00:00:42.899> had<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.350> time<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.920> spring<00:00:44.160> split

it's<00:00:45.960> hard<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.649> compare<00:00:47.010> but<00:00:47.250> i<00:00:47.460> would<00:00:47.760> say

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
it's hard to compare but i would say

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.069 
it's hard to compare but i would say
we're<00:00:49.020> really<00:00:49.500> willing<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:50.219> perform<00:00:50.719> we<00:00:51.719> are

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079

more<00:01:13.860> controlled<00:01:14.520> you're<00:01:14.850> by<00:01:15.150> far<00:01:15.180> one<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.600> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
more controlled you're by far one of the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.120 
more controlled you're by far one of the
strongest<00:01:16.110> teams<00:01:16.320> if<00:01:16.439> not<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.890> strongest

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
strongest teams if not the strongest

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
team in Europe right now what creates

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.190 
team in Europe right now what creates
those<00:01:19.680> changes<00:01:20.220> on<00:01:20.430> your<00:01:20.460> side<00:01:20.850> in<00:01:21.750> my<00:01:21.930> opinion

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
those changes on your side in my opinion

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.830 
those changes on your side in my opinion
it<00:01:22.409> was<00:01:22.560> at<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.830> individual<00:01:23.280> place<00:01:23.549> more<00:01:24.060> we

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
it was at the individual place more we

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.660 
it was at the individual place more we
have<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.290> control<00:01:25.560> ourselves<00:01:25.650> because<00:01:26.369> before

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
have to control ourselves because before

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.280 
have to control ourselves because before
we're<00:01:26.909> just<00:01:27.150> going<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.600> going<00:01:27.810> in<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.259> then

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
we're just going in going in and then

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.260 
we're just going in going in and then
now<00:01:29.009> we<00:01:29.070> just<00:01:29.250> have<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.579> control<00:01:29.909> our<00:01:30.060> emotions

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
now we just have to control our emotions

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.630 
now we just have to control our emotions
so<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.689> would<00:01:30.990> say<00:01:31.170> it's<00:01:31.500> more<00:01:31.710> work<00:01:32.369> on

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
so I would say it's more work on

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.200 
so I would say it's more work on
ourselves<00:01:32.790> more<00:01:33.509> than<00:01:33.780> work<00:01:34.670> in<00:01:35.670> our<00:01:35.850> play

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
ourselves more than work in our play

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.539 
ourselves more than work in our play
style<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:37.020> mean<00:01:37.380> it's<00:01:37.560> hard<00:01:37.680> he's<00:01:37.979> more<00:01:38.280> on

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
style so I mean it's hard he's more on

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.480 
style so I mean it's hard he's more on
our<00:01:39.210> personal<00:01:39.299> level<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:41.130> think<00:01:41.340> we're

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
our personal level and I think we're

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.910 
our personal level and I think we're
doing<00:01:41.670> great<00:01:41.850> on<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.450> yeah<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.439> hope<00:01:43.740> that

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
doing great on that and yeah I hope that

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.160 
doing great on that and yeah I hope that
we<00:01:44.310> just<00:01:44.579> improve<00:01:45.000> even<00:01:45.119> more<00:01:45.240> it's

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
we just improve even more it's

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.749 
we just improve even more it's
