00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
it's continuing and i just thought the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.670 
it's continuing and i just thought the
early<00:01:06.180> BPRD<00:01:06.840> would<00:01:07.110> have<00:01:07.229> been<00:01:07.380> much<00:01:07.619> more

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
early BPRD would have been much more

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.340 
early BPRD would have been much more
old-school<00:01:08.750> supernatural<00:01:09.750> stuff<00:01:09.990> we'd<00:01:10.229> be

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
old-school supernatural stuff we'd be

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.840 
old-school supernatural stuff we'd be
dealing<00:01:10.530> with<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.920> fallout<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.400> World<00:01:11.729> War

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
dealing with the fallout of World War

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.120 
dealing with the fallout of World War
two<00:01:12.180> we'd<00:01:12.900> be<00:01:13.049> dealing<00:01:13.200> with<00:01:13.439> like<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.860> Cold

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
two we'd be dealing with like the Cold

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.020 
two we'd be dealing with like the Cold
War<00:01:14.280> Russian<00:01:15.060> stuff<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.860> just<00:01:17.030> old-fashioned

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
War Russian stuff and just old-fashioned

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.300 
War Russian stuff and just old-fashioned
stuff<00:01:18.240> like<00:01:18.540> going<00:01:19.439> into<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.650> cellar<00:01:20.040> and

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
stuff like going into a cellar and

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.590 
stuff like going into a cellar and
driving<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.729> stake<00:01:20.939> through<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.150> vampire's

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
driving a stake through a vampire's

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.380 
driving a stake through a vampire's
heart<00:01:21.720> at<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.770> point<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.340> regular<00:01:23.759> bprd

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
heart at this point the regular bprd

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.050 
heart at this point the regular bprd
book<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.950> isn't<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.159> kind<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.549> book<00:01:26.790> anymore

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
book is isn't that kind of book anymore

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.850 
book is isn't that kind of book anymore
so<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:27.869> think<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.680> was<00:01:29.180> the<00:01:30.180> desire<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.750> do<00:01:31.439> a

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
so I think it was the desire to do a

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.609 
so I think it was the desire to do a
much<00:01:32.220> more<00:01:32.400> primitive<00:01:33.140> version<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.590> that

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
much more primitive version of that

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.399 
much more primitive version of that
group<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.369> secretly<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.150> want<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.689> do<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:37.020> really

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
group and secretly I want to do I really

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.649 
group and secretly I want to do I really
want<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.680> get<00:01:37.740> into<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.009> 50s<00:01:38.460> where<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.240> assume
