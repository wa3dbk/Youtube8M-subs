00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:06.419
 in this video we will see how to 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.610
 use the spotlight options to 

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:11.250
 to be able to work it as if it were a 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.050
 reference image to be able to model 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.810
 I do not know anything we are 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.170
 working first let's create a 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:21.040
 sphere 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:23.710
 let's choose edit to start 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.750
 edit let's turn it into a pool 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.590
 email and here let's say we're 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.570
 sculpting anything and we need 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.880
 have a reference image for 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.310
 power to be able to just guide us 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.680
 there are many ways to do this in z 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:43.170
 brush in this case I'm going to show you 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.030
 how to do it with the spotlight 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.909
 that exposes and is usually used more than 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.510
 nothing to texturize to 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:53.129
 transfer textures to a geometry but 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.329
 in this case we will use it as 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:00.479
 with a reference then let's go to 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.359
 texture let's take this to 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:07.920
 this side if we have it here we are going to 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:11.110
 import a picture a texture 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.710
 I chose for example 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:17.560
 some images with a list bar 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.260
 and we're going to add it to the nate spot with 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.229
 this button to sport line 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:26.290
 here we see that the image appears for 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:29.020
 close the live box press the comma 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:32.770
 If we do not click here 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.689
 and now we press the zy button 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.920
 we would start sculpting with 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:42.549
 reference this image but let's see 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.490
 what can I not sculpt on this side but 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:47.950
 I can only sculpt on the side that 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.789
 I have the image what happened when 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.789
 this side I can not 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.390
 to be able to write the geometry of 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.630
 any side 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.520
 even if I put it on this side I see that 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.600
 I try to sculpt and I can not do 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.600
 absolutely nothing 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.869
 then to be able to power 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.440
 just to be able to sculpt this geometry 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.230
 what we are going to do is go to the brush menu 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:20.640
 let's look here in the option that 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:24.310
 Say samples and we will deactivate the 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.250
 option that says projectile spotlight 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.880
 we deactivated once I did this now 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.910
 they will see what I can sculpt in this 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:38.280
 geometry having the spotlight the 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.280
 Spotlight image as reference 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.980
 and here we can write what we 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.019
 with eyes 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.019
 and good is a little trick 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.690
 that we can serve to 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.300
 to be able to use the 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:58.210
 spotlight as a reference image to the 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.370
 time to sculpt a geometry 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.660
 that's it for this tutorial and we 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.660
 we will see in the next
