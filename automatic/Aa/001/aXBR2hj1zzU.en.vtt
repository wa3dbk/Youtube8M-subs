up<00:02:35.989> a<00:02:36.530> little<00:02:36.799> bit<00:02:36.950> wider<00:02:37.130> into<00:02:37.640> to<00:02:38.359> see<00:02:38.600> what's

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
up a little bit wider into to see what's

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.110 
up a little bit wider into to see what's
fascinating<00:02:39.320> about<00:02:39.859> this<00:02:40.040> discovery<00:02:40.700> is<00:02:41.060> that

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
fascinating about this discovery is that

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.340 
fascinating about this discovery is that
it's<00:02:41.420> been<00:02:41.600> progressing<00:02:42.200> progressing

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
it's been progressing progressing

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.740 
it's been progressing progressing
progressing<00:02:42.890> but<00:02:43.790> it<00:02:43.910> has<00:02:44.060> yet<00:02:44.329> to<00:02:44.540> reach<00:02:44.720> the

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
progressing but it has yet to reach the

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.530 
progressing but it has yet to reach the
tipping<00:02:45.290> point<00:02:45.560> and<00:02:45.799> I<00:02:46.549> do<00:02:46.609> hope<00:02:46.970> to<00:02:47.030> be<00:02:47.299> around

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
tipping point and I do hope to be around

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.770 
tipping point and I do hope to be around
for<00:02:47.840> that<00:02:47.959> when<00:02:48.560> people<00:02:48.769> say<00:02:49.070> finally<00:02:49.780> geez

for that when people say finally geez

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:57.040 
for that when people say finally geez
maybe<00:02:51.470> maybe<00:02:52.400> this<00:02:52.700> thing<00:02:53.000> really<00:02:53.209> does<00:02:53.570> exist
