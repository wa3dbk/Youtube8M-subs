00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.910
 I'm the one I am 22 years 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.910
 old and i am a bagmaker 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.760
 my activities here are the 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.540
 repair of weapons the revision 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.680
 of weapons also restoration of attica 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.150
 Weapons making certain items 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.989
 you can not order anymore 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:04.339
 We'll do that after that 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.690
 Weapons, for example, I get to 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.510
 for example, a box of mine inserted 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.250
 and then there is new deep in tube 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.440
 I have to look at it first 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.050
 as it must because it find out now the 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.640
 accordingly montage out then must 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.220
 I work the old down the new one 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.420
 work up the rifle scope mount 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.990
 that everything fits 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.490
 These are things that would have to be very accurate 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.160
 be made because if we go to 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.020
 Example when mounting the rear two 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.210
 three tenths of a millimeter are too deep 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.310
 Then we went to 100 meters are 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.800
 We then stood 10 12 inches above that 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.970
 Go away and then of course you meet 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.600
 nothing at all shoots the weapon 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.340
 I speak around the corner 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.740
 so that foxes make crafts or 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.680
 the profession of the type you look at each 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.090
 of course, the whole thing has 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.200
 social and political 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.659
 backgrounds 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.790
 these days, weapons are always directly involved 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.320
 what bad connected 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.600
 with the wars are everywhere 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.180
 are now topic with the weapons 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.549
 Help delivery the weapons we have here 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.590
 they are all for hunters or sell 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.720
 athletes thought every single one 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.610
 it is registered and will only 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.519
 it sells to people 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.280
 may purchase products with 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.700
 We do not act on war weapons 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.019
 at all the possession of 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.340
 fully automatic weapons is in 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.350
 Germany generally prohibited 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.959
 you also have to be specific 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.430
 Statistics look at the weapons 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.780
 are violent crime or at all 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.230
 used the criminal delicts 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.680
 become 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.150
 in a larger percentage illegal 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.650
 are these are the weapons that are 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.290
 illegal this country has been introduced 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.430
 which are not registered 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.600
 that's the same as if you were there 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.700
 Somehow something illegal 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.079
 Drug use would say that for people 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:47.670
 get cannabis because they are sick 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:49.500
 that is really silly 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.390
 So if we then, for example, a 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.890
 Weapon sell here at the counter 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.790
 a prospect a hunter or 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.680
 sport protect 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.660
 Of course we have to go here first 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.069
 The man has his 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.330
 papers and are the papers 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.830
 at all still valid for example the 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.360
 Hunting license, the hunting license is solved 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.430
 so the man of then is then 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.780
 entitled at all with the 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.850
 Weapons possession card the weapons at all 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.160
 to have in his possession 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.840
 and then of course still has to be tested 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.390
 Will if what he wants to buy 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.830
 There's still room for it as you say 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.510
 For example, a hunter is allowed only two 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.800
 if you buy right now here 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.050
 is coming and already has two on his 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.590
 map would acquire device then there have 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.590
 I sell them 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.470
 There should and should be hunters 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.860
 they are available at every sport that exists 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.390
 in everyone in their class of 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.769
 society there are always people who 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.330
 stick to all rules and do 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.709
 everything as it should be and there is 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.910
 also people who has football 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:46.950
 Straddle if someone has a weapon 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.860
 seizes whether it may or not and 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:54.000
 for someone else to cause pain 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.380
 that's just simply a tired and you 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.060
 could now say that sorry there is 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.010
 not by weapons but that grief gives 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.470
 it also diameter or by cars and 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.760
 when to kill someone for example 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.440
 wants and he throws himself from train 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.959
 that is not a nice picture for the 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.030
 chance so sorry and suicide or murder 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:12.000
 There was always and always will be 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.769
 the thing would have to be from the person itself 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.530
 to be regulated that man in itself 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.989
 gets himself under control 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.880
 not at all to such thoughts in 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.180
 the situation is or lead from it 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.180
 leaves
