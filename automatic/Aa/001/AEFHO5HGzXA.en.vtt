hello savor lane Vader's vault here

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.789 
hello savor lane Vader's vault here
showing<00:00:03.240> off<00:00:03.480> another<00:00:04.080> custom<00:00:04.440> say<00:00:04.589> we're<00:00:04.740> out

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799

showing off another custom say we're out
of<00:00:04.830> the<00:00:04.950> vault<00:00:05.100> this<00:00:05.790> one<00:00:05.970> is<00:00:06.089> called<00:00:06.120> haze<00:00:06.509> it

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
of the vault this one is called haze it

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.040 
of the vault this one is called haze it
is<00:00:07.410> very<00:00:07.649> similar<00:00:08.040> to<00:00:08.220> our<00:00:08.849> ember<00:00:09.420> saber<00:00:09.719> that

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
is very similar to our ember saber that

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.280 
is very similar to our ember saber that
we<00:00:10.170> just<00:00:10.410> put<00:00:10.590> up<00:00:10.679> and<00:00:10.980> auctioned<00:00:11.700> off<00:00:12.139> like<00:00:13.139> I

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
we just put up and auctioned off like I

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.110 
we just put up and auctioned off like I
mentioned<00:00:13.349> in<00:00:13.830> that<00:00:13.950> video<00:00:14.250> that<00:00:14.460> we<00:00:14.940> are

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
mentioned in that video that we are

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.470 
mentioned in that video that we are
working<00:00:15.299> on<00:00:15.570> an<00:00:15.690> upcoming<00:00:17.060> mid-level<00:00:18.060> line<00:00:18.270> of

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
working on an upcoming mid-level line of

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.929 
working on an upcoming mid-level line of
savers<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.340> we're<00:00:20.340> trying<00:00:20.520> some<00:00:20.910> different

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
savers and we're trying some different

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.689 
savers and we're trying some different
things<00:00:21.210> out<00:00:21.539> see<00:00:21.810> what<00:00:21.930> works<00:00:22.170> what<00:00:22.410> doesn't

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:22.699 
things out see what works what doesn't

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.790 
things out see what works what doesn't
and<00:00:23.699> we're<00:00:23.939> trying<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.240> put<00:00:24.359> some<00:00:24.800> upgraded

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
and we're trying to put some upgraded

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.130 
and we're trying to put some upgraded
features<00:00:26.220> in<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.789> into<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.300> design<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:27.990> we're

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
features in the into the design so we're

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.349 
features in the into the design so we're
we're<00:00:28.740> trying<00:00:29.039> several<00:00:29.340> things<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:30.029> see<00:00:30.210> how

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
we're trying several things to see how

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.720 
we're trying several things to see how
much<00:00:30.539> work<00:00:30.720> goes<00:00:30.960> into<00:00:31.019> these<00:00:31.380> features<00:00:31.859> some

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
much work goes into these features some

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.280 
much work goes into these features some
of<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.880> things<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.420> see<00:00:33.630> on<00:00:33.930> these

some brass piping with some aluminum
over<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.759> then<00:01:45.329> in<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.869> back<00:01:46.079> here<00:01:46.380> we've

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
over it and then in the back here we've

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.179 
over it and then in the back here we've
got<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:47.009> polished<00:01:48.229> brass<00:01:49.229> script<00:01:49.590> strips<00:01:49.920> and

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
got the polished brass script strips and

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.819 
got the polished brass script strips and
laid<00:01:50.369> into<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.759> rear<00:01:50.970> section<00:01:51.479> here<00:01:51.720> all<00:01:52.680> the

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
laid into the rear section here all the

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.370 
laid into the rear section here all the
way<00:01:52.860> around<00:01:53.070> so<00:01:53.880> there<00:01:54.060> is<00:01:54.090> some<00:01:54.329> some<00:01:54.750> work

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
way around so there is some some work

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.130 
way around so there is some some work
involved<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:55.979> all<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.540> so<00:01:57.540> we<00:01:57.689> don't<00:01:57.780> know<00:01:57.960> if

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
involved in all that so we don't know if

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.200 
involved in all that so we don't know if
that<00:01:58.710> will<00:01:58.829> carry<00:01:59.009> forward<00:01:59.159> but<00:01:59.700> here<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.090> is

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
design this one is probably a little bit

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.020 
design this one is probably a little bit
more<00:02:06.329> polished<00:02:06.780> than<00:02:07.220> what<00:02:08.220> was<00:02:08.369> on<00:02:08.399> ember<00:02:09.000> I

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
more polished than what was on ember I

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.680 
more polished than what was on ember I
actually

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
actually

it buff the entire hilt first and then

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.470 
it buff the entire hilt first and then
whether<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.960> tad<00:02:13.710> so<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.580> is<00:02:14.610> very<00:02:15.000> close<00:02:15.330> to

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
whether it a tad so it is very close to

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.050 
whether it a tad so it is very close to
my<00:02:15.600> 10<00:02:15.840> foot<00:02:16.020> weathering<00:02:16.520> from<00:02:17.520> 10<00:02:17.790> feet<00:02:17.940> away
