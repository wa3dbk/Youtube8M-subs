00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.370
 Today we drive the fifth generation 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.930
 of the subaru outback 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.960
 the car is driven by one 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.760
 two-liter boxer diesel engine with 150 hp 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.440
 the power transmission takes place via a 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.820
 so-called lineartronic gearbox that 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.800
 means we talk about a stepless 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.360
 automatic thanks to the permanent 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.980
 four-wheel drive feels the vehicle 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.630
 course on gravel roads or ice 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.130
 wet street and here too 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.140
 home 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.059
 the four-wheel drive crossover combined with 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.670
 walking his ground is the leading animal 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.829
 the subaru meute greater ground clearance 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.050
 high trailer loads ago 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.850
 alone the offroader or towing vehicle 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.839
 clichÃ© wants subaru with the outback 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.139
 do not operate 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:49.479
 the manufacturer attaches importance to comfort and 

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:50.789
 driving safety around as many buyers 

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:53.440
 to address 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.260
 the special thing about our test vehicle 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.079
 the outback 2 liter diesel comfort navi 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.260
 cvt is undoubtedly a stepless one 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.269
 automatic transmission lineartronic it is 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.789
 worldwide the first time that a boxer 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:09.700
 diesel with a cvt gear crosses 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:11.619
 the engine was running while accelerating 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.240
 always in the highest performance the 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.479
 speed controls the lineartronic 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.530
 through the appropriate translation 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.320
 in total, the self-igniter is involved 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.060
 its maximum 350 newton meters on us 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.450
 a very solid though right 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.909
 pithy impression its 150 ps the the 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.429
 combo in 9 7 seconds on pace 100 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.579
 bring every driving situation 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:33.549
 grown 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:36.159
 the top speed is 195 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:38.890
 km h and with the combined consumption 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:41.259
 Of 6.3 liters, one can quite live 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.640
 a subaru is not a vehicle for 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.499
 everyone is doing the current 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.149
 outback no difference the landing gear 

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:47.530
 for example, it is very tightly tuned 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:48.999
 which is very good for fast cornering 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.049
 is pleasant and certainly also from 

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:51.520
 advantage is when you go through 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:53.259
 blow hole driving car does not strike 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.670
 bad though if they are long 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.899
 routes on the highway are on the way 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.429
 because they are clearly comfort 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.810
 miss 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.220
 pleasantly direct presents itself against it 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.290
 the steering 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.030
 she always provides feedback on the 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.070
 Ride under the wheels 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.780
 so that the allradler can also 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.729
 swift and very precise about 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.370
 lead gravel roads or forest roads 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.940
 here is the unmistakable in his 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.860
 metier is the interior of the outback 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.260
 very clean processed though he 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.020
 Overall rather functional than living room 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.640
 similar to some switches like the 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.070
 electronic parking brake were 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.870
 ergonomic positioned the 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.820
 seating position including the 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.070
 Side seating is very good 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.970
 Driver and passenger have plenty 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:38.620
 This also applies to the fund 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.840
 practically the position of the lever is too 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.560
 fold down the back seat on the outside 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.530
 the seats without contortions will be out 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:50.980
 526 liters of ratzfatz 1726 liters 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.170
 load volumes were at most too loud 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.050
 almost 500 kilos and one unchecked 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.880
 trailer load of 750 kilos is recommended 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.520
 the subaru is more impressive 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.290
 Master of the current subaru outback 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.450
 offers everything a diehard subaru 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.400
 Drivers expect the vehicle is extreme 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.260
 robust very off-road and has 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.730
 about permanent all-wheel drive the 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.160
 however, outback has its price 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.870
 the basic version is 37,000 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.459
 euro the test vehicle driven by us 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.769
 with automatic transmission and boxer engine 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.769
 is over 46,000
