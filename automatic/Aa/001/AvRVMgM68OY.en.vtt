international centers and so we see many

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.499 
international centers and so we see many
patients<00:00:26.779> from<00:00:27.769> around<00:00:28.099> the<00:00:28.249> world<00:00:28.509> with

take care of one is called melanoma and
that's<00:00:37.039> usually<00:00:37.460> in<00:00:37.579> adults<00:00:38.199> and<00:00:39.199> another

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
melanoma from the eye and what we now

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.350 
melanoma from the eye and what we now
understand<00:01:15.560> is<00:01:15.830> that<00:01:16.220> in<00:01:16.610> order<00:01:16.790> to<00:01:17.030> develop

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
understand is that in order to develop

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.150 
understand is that in order to develop
effective<00:01:17.840> treatments<00:01:18.650> we<00:01:18.800> need<00:01:19.010> to

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
effective treatments we need to

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.680 
effective treatments we need to
understand<00:01:19.760> the<00:01:20.480> gene<00:01:21.010> damage<00:01:22.010> or<00:01:22.690> mutations

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
understand the gene damage or mutations

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.190 
understand the gene damage or mutations
that<00:01:23.930> occur<00:01:24.770> in<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:25.580> cancer<00:01:26.150> that<00:01:26.660> allow<00:01:26.990> it

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
that occur in the cancer that allow it

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.620 
that occur in the cancer that allow it
to<00:01:27.230> become<00:01:27.500> more<00:01:28.040> and<00:01:28.160> more<00:01:28.250> malignant<00:01:28.700> so<00:01:29.360> my

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
to become more and more malignant so my

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.050 
to become more and more malignant so my
research<00:01:29.810> is<00:01:30.260> focused<00:01:30.770> on<00:01:30.890> identifying<00:01:31.130> these

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
research is focused on identifying these

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.080 
research is focused on identifying these
genes<00:01:32.480> that<00:01:32.870> become<00:01:33.260> damaged<00:01:33.830> so<00:01:34.520> that<00:01:34.760> we<00:01:34.880> can

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
genes that become damaged so that we can

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.710 
genes that become damaged so that we can
develop<00:01:35.960> targeted<00:01:36.500> drugs<00:01:37.220> that<00:01:37.790> that<00:01:38.180> attack

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
develop targeted drugs that that attack

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.660 
develop targeted drugs that that attack
the<00:01:39.050> damaged<00:01:39.950> genes<00:01:40.100> and<00:01:40.760> so<00:01:41.480> two<00:01:42.350> of<00:01:42.380> the<00:01:42.710> most

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
the damaged genes and so two of the most

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.190 
the damaged genes and so two of the most
important<00:01:44.270> genes<00:01:44.600> that<00:01:44.900> have<00:01:44.960> been

another major mutation that we
