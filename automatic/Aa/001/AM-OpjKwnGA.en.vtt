there's<00:00:05.399> Lauren<00:00:05.790> harder<00:00:06.059> work<00:00:06.269> designing<00:00:07.140> and

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
there's Lauren harder work designing and

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.370 
there's Lauren harder work designing and
building<00:00:08.209> recumbent<00:00:09.209> wooden<00:00:09.450> bicycle<00:00:09.990> step

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
building recumbent wooden bicycle step

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.039 
building recumbent wooden bicycle step
one<00:00:10.620> was<00:00:10.860> idea<00:00:11.340> generation<00:00:11.849> then<00:00:12.660> he<00:00:12.750> sketches

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
one was idea generation then he sketches

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.990 
one was idea generation then he sketches
in<00:00:13.349> his<00:00:13.500> engineers<00:00:14.129> notebook<00:00:14.549> in<00:00:14.670> front<00:00:14.910> of

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
in his engineers notebook in front of

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.950 
in his engineers notebook in front of
them<00:00:15.150> then<00:00:15.839> from<00:00:16.169> there<00:00:16.470> you<00:00:17.189> went<00:00:17.369> to

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
them then from there you went to

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.900 
them then from there you went to
Autodesk<00:00:18.960> Inventor<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.980> then<00:00:20.160> modeled<00:00:20.730> it

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
Autodesk Inventor and then modeled it

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.900 
Autodesk Inventor and then modeled it
and<00:00:21.509> all<00:00:22.140> right<00:00:22.320> this<00:00:22.500> is<00:00:22.680> my<00:00:22.890> recumbent<00:00:23.730> bike

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
and all right this is my recumbent bike

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.690 
and all right this is my recumbent bike
so<00:00:24.599> I<00:00:24.660> started<00:00:25.079> out<00:00:25.290> with<00:00:25.710> paper<00:00:25.980> plans<00:00:26.309> and

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:26.700 
so I started out with paper plans and

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.909 
so I started out with paper plans and
sketched<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.149> ideas<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.980> then<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.009> made<00:00:30.919> the

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:31.919 
sketched the ideas and then I made the

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:35.270 
sketched the ideas and then I made the
parts<00:00:32.250> in<00:00:32.579> Autodesk<00:00:33.059> Inventor<00:00:33.920> which<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:35.100> then

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
parts in Autodesk Inventor which I then

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.310 
parts in Autodesk Inventor which I then
assembled<00:00:35.850> into<00:00:36.649> this<00:00:37.649> assembly<00:00:38.129> here<00:00:39.170> it's<00:00:40.170> a

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
assembled into this assembly here it's a

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.009 
assembled into this assembly here it's a
scale<00:00:40.679> model<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:41.249> it<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.579> then<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:41.999> took<00:00:42.149> the

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:43.019 
scale model of it and then I took the

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:49.540 
scale model of it and then I took the
parts<00:00:43.469> for<00:00:43.859> the<00:00:43.980> CNC<00:00:45.469> over<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.589> mastercam<00:00:48.469> to

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
parts for the CNC over to mastercam to

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.989 
parts for the CNC over to mastercam to
toolpath<00:00:50.550> through<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:50.999> router<00:00:51.409> and<00:00:52.999> then

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:53.999 
toolpath through the router and then

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:56.000 
toolpath through the router and then
I'll<00:00:54.239> be<00:00:54.420> able<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.659> run<00:00:54.870> these<00:00:55.050> parts<00:00:55.469> on<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
I'll be able to run these parts on the

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.700 
I'll be able to run these parts on the
CNC<00:00:56.309> router<00:00:56.670> on<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:56.909> shop<00:01:00.440> thought<00:01:01.440> for<00:01:01.469> the

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
CNC router on the shop thought for the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.680 
CNC router on the shop thought for the
day<00:01:01.769> Lauren<00:01:03.140> it<00:01:04.140> was<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.290> good<00:01:04.500> day<00:01:05.690> board

started<00:01:26.670> out<00:01:26.820> by<00:01:27.270> editing<00:01:28.260> some<00:01:28.470> plans<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.890> got

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
started out by editing some plans I got

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.550 
started out by editing some plans I got
online<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:30.390> made<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:31.140> wooden<00:01:31.410> frame<00:01:33.500> and<00:01:34.500> I

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
online and I made the wooden frame and I

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.830 
online and I made the wooden frame and I
incorporated<00:01:35.540> metal<00:01:36.540> bike<00:01:36.720> parts

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.650 

and<00:01:40.620> then<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:40.920> did<00:01:41.220> some<00:01:41.520> an<00:01:41.850> internship<00:01:42.270> at<00:01:42.600> a

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
and then I did some an internship at a

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.090 
and then I did some an internship at a
bike<00:01:42.840> shop<00:01:42.870> to<00:01:43.290> kind<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.530> learn<00:01:43.650> more<00:01:43.950> about

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
bike shop to kind of learn more about

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.780 
bike shop to kind of learn more about
how<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.750> components<00:01:45.750> worked<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.790> got

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
how the components worked and I got

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.090 
how the components worked and I got
components<00:01:48.150> from

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
components from

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.830 
components from
the<00:01:50.490> guy<00:01:50.670> in<00:01:50.820> town<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.420> we<00:01:52.260> got<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.500> all<00:01:52.590> set<00:01:52.830> up

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
the guy in town and we got it all set up
