is<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.740> launches<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.159> map<00:01:17.400> now<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:17.729> maps

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
is it launches this map now this maps

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.789 
is it launches this map now this maps
available<00:01:18.180> on<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.750> interweb<00:01:19.020> given<00:01:19.380> internet

you<00:01:19.890> can<00:01:19.950> go<00:01:20.130> out<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.310> get<00:01:20.490> this<00:01:20.670> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
you can go out and get this the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.640 
you can go out and get this the
difference<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.780> when<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.110> do<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.439> you're

difference is when you do that you're
going<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.860> have<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.250> find<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.119> launched<00:01:24.390> it

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
going to have to find it launched it

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.020 
going to have to find it launched it
tool<00:01:25.530> around<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.979> find<00:01:26.280> where<00:01:26.400> you're<00:01:26.520> at<00:01:26.640> what

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
tool around to find where you're at what

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.539 
tool around to find where you're at what
we<00:01:27.210> do<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.869> we<00:01:28.110> have<00:01:28.259> time<00:01:28.530> coded<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:29.040> against

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
we do is we have time coded this against

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.969 
we do is we have time coded this against
the<00:01:30.030> actual<00:01:30.240> playback<00:01:30.840> experience<00:01:31.049> so<00:01:31.829> this

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
the actual playback experience so this

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.920 
the actual playback experience so this
map<00:01:32.189> will<00:01:32.400> update<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.090> move<00:01:33.270> automatically

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
map will update and move automatically

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.539
