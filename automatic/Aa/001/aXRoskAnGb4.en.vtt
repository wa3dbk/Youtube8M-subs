00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
the moneymaker for Cummins I think

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.240 
the moneymaker for Cummins I think

properly<00:02:45.360> either<00:02:45.480> let<00:02:45.750> me<00:02:45.810> look<00:02:45.959> how<00:02:46.080> bad<00:02:46.260> well

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
properly either let me look how bad well

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.440 
properly either let me look how bad well
yeah<00:02:46.830> and<00:02:47.160> that's<00:02:47.340> even<00:02:47.760> after<00:02:47.880> you've<00:02:48.180> tapped

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
yeah and that's even after you've tapped

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.920 
yeah and that's even after you've tapped
on<00:02:48.750> it

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
on it

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.690 
on it
yeah<00:02:49.110> that's<00:02:49.320> after<00:02:49.500> I<00:02:49.590> clean<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:50.370> actual

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
yeah that's after I clean the actual

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.979 
yeah that's after I clean the actual
pressure<00:02:50.910> sensor<00:02:51.360> that's<00:02:51.510> a<00:02:51.630> temperature

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
pressure sensor that's a temperature

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.110 
pressure sensor that's a temperature
sensor<00:02:52.320> the<00:02:52.980> actual<00:02:53.250> pressure<00:02:53.489> sensors<00:02:53.970> in

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
sensor the actual pressure sensors in

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.600 
sensor the actual pressure sensors in
the<00:02:54.209> head<00:02:54.480> here<00:02:54.780> so<00:02:55.530> all<00:02:55.860> this<00:02:56.100> packs<00:02:56.430> up

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
the head here so all this packs up

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.370 
the head here so all this packs up
around<00:02:56.850> here<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.450> can't<00:02:57.720> read<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.230> actual

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
around here and it can't read the actual

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.410 
around here and it can't read the actual
boost<00:02:58.980> pressure<00:02:59.340> for<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.700> engine<00:03:00.000> so<00:03:00.300> it

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
boost pressure for the engine so it

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.540 
boost pressure for the engine so it
don't<00:03:00.600> know<00:03:00.720> how<00:03:00.810> much<00:03:00.959> fuel<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.320> give<00:03:01.560> it<00:03:01.709> so

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
don't know how much fuel to give it so

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.949 
don't know how much fuel to give it so
what's<00:03:02.790> it<00:03:02.880> do<00:03:03.030> it<00:03:03.150> over<00:03:03.390> fuels<00:03:03.630> it<00:03:03.810> when

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
what's it do it over fuels it when

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.390 
what's it do it over fuels it when
you're<00:03:04.080> in<00:03:04.170> light<00:03:04.350> loads<00:03:04.620> and<00:03:04.860> it<00:03:04.950> under<00:03:05.160> fuels

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
you're in light loads and it under fuels

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.620 
you're in light loads and it under fuels
it<00:03:05.519> when<00:03:05.640> you're<00:03:05.760> in<00:03:05.850> heavy<00:03:06.030> loads<00:03:06.269> you<00:03:06.450> lose

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
it when you're in heavy loads you lose

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.620 
it when you're in heavy loads you lose
power<00:03:06.900> and<00:03:07.230> you<00:03:07.680> lose<00:03:07.860> fuel<00:03:08.010> knowledge<00:03:08.630> so

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
power and you lose fuel knowledge so

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.900 
power and you lose fuel knowledge so
there<00:03:10.140> that<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:10.650> when<00:03:11.130> you're<00:03:11.280> when<00:03:11.880> you're

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
there that and when you're when you're

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.729 
there that and when you're when you're
over<00:03:12.239> fueling<00:03:12.600> it's<00:03:12.720> creating<00:03:13.050> access<00:03:13.350> so<00:03:13.530> you

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
over fueling it's creating access so you

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.320 
over fueling it's creating access so you
never<00:03:13.920> see<00:03:14.160> this<00:03:14.280> up<00:03:14.459> because<00:03:14.580> you<00:03:14.730> have<00:03:14.910> a<00:03:14.940> DPF

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
never see this up because you have a DPF

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.880 
never see this up because you have a DPF
can<00:03:15.570> so<00:03:16.080> you<00:03:16.170> never<00:03:16.320> see<00:03:16.470> it<00:03:16.530> coming<00:03:16.560> right

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
can so you never see it coming right

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.310 
can so you never see it coming right
back<00:03:17.040> it<00:03:17.640> just<00:03:17.850> builds<00:03:18.570> up<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:18.840> builds<00:03:18.959> up<00:03:19.140> and

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
back it just builds up and builds up and

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.309 
back it just builds up and builds up and
builds<00:03:19.410> up<00:03:20.240> it's<00:03:21.240> terrible

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
builds up it's terrible

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.229 
builds up it's terrible
so<00:03:23.090> that's<00:03:24.090> uh<00:03:25.400> something<00:03:26.400> else<00:03:26.430> to<00:03:26.579> fix<00:03:26.730> okay

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
so that's uh something else to fix okay

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.009 
so that's uh something else to fix okay
um

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
um

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.880 
um
after<00:03:28.500> Ross<00:03:28.680> and<00:03:28.920> I<00:03:28.980> pulled<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:30.349> imap<00:03:31.349> sensor

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
after Ross and I pulled the imap sensor

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.330 
after Ross and I pulled the imap sensor
and<00:03:32.189> the<00:03:32.790> manifold<00:03:33.500> air<00:03:34.500> pressure<00:03:34.980> and

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
and the manifold air pressure and

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.199 
and the manifold air pressure and
temperature<00:03:36.299> sensor<00:03:36.829> I<00:03:37.879> decided<00:03:38.879> to<00:03:38.970> go<00:03:39.090> ahead

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
temperature sensor I decided to go ahead

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.740 
temperature sensor I decided to go ahead
and<00:03:39.450> pull<00:03:39.599> my<00:03:39.629> venturi<00:03:40.170> pipe<00:03:41.060> that<00:03:42.060> this

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
and pull my venturi pipe that this

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.229 
and pull my venturi pipe that this
actually<00:03:43.230> is<00:03:43.439> the<00:03:43.950> EGR<00:03:44.280> pipe<00:03:44.640> this<00:03:44.849> is<00:03:45.060> where

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
actually is the EGR pipe this is where

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.990 
actually is the EGR pipe this is where
the<00:03:45.390> EGR<00:03:45.720> gas<00:03:46.109> has<00:03:46.349> come<00:03:46.590> in<00:03:46.769> and<00:03:46.980> then<00:03:47.609> go<00:03:47.790> into

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
the EGR gas has come in and then go into

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000 
the EGR gas has come in and then go into
your<00:03:48.269> hinge<00:03:48.510> and<00:03:48.689> intake<00:03:50.420> when<00:03:51.420> I<00:03:51.450> did<00:03:51.810> that<00:03:52.049> in

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
your hinge and intake when I did that in

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.309 
your hinge and intake when I did that in
pulling<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:53.939> pipe<00:03:54.150> I<00:03:54.420> removed<00:03:54.930> it<00:03:55.079> from<00:03:55.230> the

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
pulling the pipe I removed it from the

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.069 
pulling the pipe I removed it from the

tune-up<00:04:02.909> and<00:04:03.169> I'm<00:04:04.169> stretching<00:04:04.650> it<00:04:04.919> when<00:04:05.129> I<00:04:05.159> say

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
tune-up and I'm stretching it when I say

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.860 
tune-up and I'm stretching it when I say
a<00:04:05.459> hundred<00:04:05.879> thousand<00:04:06.329> miles<00:04:06.510> ago

a hundred thousand miles ago

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.869 
a hundred thousand miles ago
realistically<00:04:07.769> it's<00:04:07.919> probably<00:04:08.370> been<00:04:08.549> eighty

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
realistically it's probably been eighty

realistically it's probably been eighty
thousand<00:04:09.480> miles<00:04:09.720> ago<00:04:10.139> and<00:04:10.579> this<00:04:11.579> is<00:04:11.849> the<00:04:11.939> suit

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
thousand miles ago and this is the suit

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:15.289 
thousand miles ago and this is the suit
that's<00:04:13.590> built<00:04:13.950> up<00:04:14.099> I<00:04:14.310> clean<00:04:14.669> this<00:04:14.849> out<00:04:15.060> with

that's built up I clean this out with

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.849 
that's built up I clean this out with
brake<00:04:15.569> cleaner<00:04:15.599> and<00:04:16.349> a<00:04:17.250> scrub<00:04:18.150> brush<00:04:18.180> and<00:04:18.870> had

miles with the with this this is what

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:35.110 
miles with the with this this is what
I've<00:04:29.909> this<00:04:30.870> is<00:04:31.080> what<00:04:31.260> I've<00:04:31.349> come<00:04:31.530> up<00:04:31.740> with<00:04:33.349> and

out of my hand if you look in here I

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.629 
out of my hand if you look in here I
don't<00:04:41.550> know<00:04:41.789> if<00:04:41.849> the<00:04:42.030> sun'll<00:04:42.500> showed<00:04:43.520> but<00:04:44.520> you

don't know if the sun'll showed but you

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:48.080 
don't know if the sun'll showed but you
can<00:04:44.820> see<00:04:45.380> how<00:04:46.380> all<00:04:46.560> the<00:04:46.740> suits<00:04:47.070> the<00:04:47.760> suits

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
can see how all the suits the suits

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.800 
can see how all the suits the suits
built<00:04:48.389> up<00:04:48.659> again<00:04:48.840> and<00:04:49.430> it<00:04:50.430> certainly<00:04:51.210> all<00:04:51.479> sets

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
built up again and it certainly all sets

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.629 
built up again and it certainly all sets
doing<00:04:52.260> is<00:04:52.470> every<00:04:52.860> time<00:04:53.010> you<00:04:53.070> hit<00:04:53.310> a<00:04:53.370> bump

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
doing is every time you hit a bump

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.990 
doing is every time you hit a bump
vibrate<00:04:54.620> that<00:04:55.620> those<00:04:56.039> pieces<00:04:56.310> break<00:04:56.699> free<00:04:56.970> and

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
vibrate that those pieces break free and

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.510 
vibrate that those pieces break free and
they're<00:04:57.210> sucked<00:04:57.449> right<00:04:57.690> in<00:04:58.010> to<00:04:59.010> your<00:04:59.070> head<00:04:59.250> and

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
they're sucked right in to your head and

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.310 
they're sucked right in to your head and
then<00:04:59.699> put<00:04:59.970> right<00:05:00.180> back<00:05:00.210> in<00:05:00.659> to<00:05:00.990> the<00:05:01.139> motor

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
then put right back in to the motor

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.589 
then put right back in to the motor
again<00:05:01.620> so<00:05:02.130> you're<00:05:02.280> you<00:05:02.669> know<00:05:02.729> you're<00:05:03.360> getting

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:03.599 
again so you're you know you're getting

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:05.360 
again so you're you know you're getting
this<00:05:03.690> stuff<00:05:03.900> in<00:05:04.110> your<00:05:04.199> cylinders<00:05:04.710> it's<00:05:04.979> blown

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
this stuff in your cylinders it's blown

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.870 
this stuff in your cylinders it's blown
out<00:05:05.669> back<00:05:06.479> through<00:05:06.720> the<00:05:06.870> turbo<00:05:07.289> again<00:05:07.620> and<00:05:07.889> it

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
out back through the turbo again and it

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.810 
out back through the turbo again and it
seems<00:05:09.659> like<00:05:09.870> a<00:05:09.900> runaway<00:05:10.349> process<00:05:11.010> of<00:05:11.190> just

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
seems like a runaway process of just

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.930 
seems like a runaway process of just
suit<00:05:12.810> build-up<00:05:13.409> to<00:05:13.680> me<00:05:13.860> it<00:05:14.130> is<00:05:14.250> runaway
