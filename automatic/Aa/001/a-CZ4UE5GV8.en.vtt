we<00:00:12.929> do<00:00:13.139> this<00:00:13.320> or<00:00:13.679> we<00:00:14.009> experiment<00:00:14.639> with<00:00:14.790> rep

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
we do this or we experiment with rep

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.700 
we do this or we experiment with rep
ranges<00:00:15.440> so<00:00:16.440> we<00:00:16.710> have<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:18.080> we<00:00:19.080> do<00:00:19.199> for<00:00:19.410> weeks<00:00:19.590> at<00:00:19.680> a

if<00:01:28.260> you<00:01:28.470> fight<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.710> going<00:01:28.830> to<00:01:28.920> grow<00:01:29.100> to

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
if you fight is going to grow to

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.310 
if you fight is going to grow to
accommodate<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.030> way<00:01:30.180> but<00:01:30.840> once<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.049> can<00:01:31.200> do

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
accommodate that way but once you can do

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.010 
accommodate that way but once you can do
a<00:01:31.350> hundred<00:01:31.440> thirty-five<00:01:31.920> pounds<00:01:32.130> for<00:01:32.369> 20<00:01:32.640> reps

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
a hundred thirty-five pounds for 20 reps

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.600 
a hundred thirty-five pounds for 20 reps
that's<00:01:34.020> not<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.260> shock<00:01:34.560> anybody<00:01:35.130> doesn't<00:01:35.340> need

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
that's not a shock anybody doesn't need

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.170 
that's not a shock anybody doesn't need
doesn't<00:01:36.390> have<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.570> desire<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.430> grow<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:39.030> know

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
doesn't have the desire to grow you know

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.660 
doesn't have the desire to grow you know
especially<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.619> do<00:01:40.710> something<00:01:41.100> as<00:01:41.220> taxing<00:01:41.640> and

away<00:01:46.460> heavy<00:01:47.460> weight<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.210> we<00:01:48.360> lift<00:01:48.570> they<00:01:48.750> fall

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
away heavy weight and we lift they fall

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.749

in on the five to a rep range meaning

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.670 
in on the five to a rep range meaning
around<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.270> reference<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.810> be<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:51.960> failure<00:01:52.259> and

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
weeks over we try to use that same way

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.120 
weeks over we try to use that same way
that<00:02:03.210> we<00:02:03.330> live<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.630> 45<00:02:03.929> today<00:02:04.110> reps<00:02:04.410> and<00:02:05.039> we

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
that we live to 45 today reps and we

that we live to 45 today reps and we
shall<00:02:05.250> lift<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.640> way<00:02:05.789> for<00:02:06.000> 10<00:02:06.179> or<00:02:06.210> 12<00:02:06.539> reps<00:02:06.780> so

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
shall lift that way for 10 or 12 reps so

we<00:02:21.600> do<00:02:21.750> for<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:21.989> next<00:02:22.200> four<00:02:22.920> weeks<00:02:23.190> so<00:02:23.280> it's

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
we do for the next four weeks so it's

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.160 
we do for the next four weeks so it's

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
then we start over we go back to

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.300 
then we start over we go back to
a heavier<00:02:30.379> way<00:02:30.560> to<00:02:30.620> keep<00:02:30.950> trying<00:02:31.219> to

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
a heavier way to keep trying to

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.230 
you start doing your training your
slow-twitch<00:03:10.500> muscle<00:03:10.800> fibers<00:03:11.160> they<00:03:11.850> respond

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
slow-twitch muscle fibers they respond

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.940 
slow-twitch muscle fibers they respond
better<00:03:12.480> to<00:03:12.600> higher<00:03:12.900> rep<00:03:13.230> ranges<00:03:13.620> you<00:03:13.800> know

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
better to higher rep ranges you know

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.500 
better to higher rep ranges you know
like<00:03:14.160> you<00:03:14.310> know<00:03:14.340> 10<00:03:14.730> or<00:03:14.760> 12<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:15.240> stuff<00:03:15.390> like

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
like you know 10 or 12 and stuff like

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.700 
like you know 10 or 12 and stuff like
that<00:03:15.570> so<00:03:16.160> I<00:03:17.840> took<00:03:18.840> it<00:03:18.960> upon<00:03:19.020> myself<00:03:19.200> to<00:03:19.530> go<00:03:19.650> on

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
that so I took it upon myself to go on

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:20.960 
that so I took it upon myself to go on
the<00:03:19.800> internet<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.190> do<00:03:20.370> some<00:03:20.520> research<00:03:20.670> to

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
the internet and do some research to

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.030 
the internet and do some research to
find<00:03:21.150> out<00:03:21.390> you<00:03:22.050> know<00:03:22.110> my<00:03:22.500> you<00:03:22.770> know<00:03:22.890> the

find out you know my you know the

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.890 
find out you know my you know the

though we different you know we you know

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.520 
though we different you know we you know
it's<00:03:26.340> kind<00:03:26.670> of<00:03:26.730> similar<00:03:26.960> and<00:03:27.960> I<00:03:28.020> find<00:03:28.290> out<00:03:28.410> you

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
it's kind of similar and I find out you

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.290 
it's kind of similar and I find out you
know<00:03:28.620> which<00:03:29.160> of<00:03:29.190> my<00:03:29.370> muscles<00:03:29.700> were<00:03:29.730> faster

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
know which of my muscles were faster

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.470 
know which of my muscles were faster
issues<00:03:30.630> were<00:03:30.780> slow<00:03:31.050> twitch<00:03:31.350> and

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
issues were slow twitch and

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.540 
issues were slow twitch and
and<00:03:33.750> it<00:03:34.230> gave<00:03:34.620> me<00:03:34.650> a<00:03:34.739> lot<00:03:34.830> of<00:03:34.890> answers<00:03:35.250> a<00:03:35.310> lot<00:03:35.370> of

and it gave me a lot of answers a lot of

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:36.830 
and it gave me a lot of answers a lot of

higher<00:04:03.390> branches<00:04:03.989> and<00:04:04.349> I<00:04:04.560> was<00:04:04.650> like<00:04:04.739> why<00:04:04.860> that

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
higher branches and I was like why that

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.830 
higher branches and I was like why that
make<00:04:05.190> sense<00:04:05.370> show<00:04:05.760> the<00:04:05.970> same<00:04:06.180> thing<00:04:06.450> now

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
make sense show the same thing now

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.360 
make sense show the same thing now
understand<00:04:07.230> why<00:04:07.260> i<00:04:07.410> made<00:04:07.799> a<00:04:07.860> video<00:04:07.980> check<00:04:08.220> out

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
understand why i made a video check out

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.039 
understand why i made a video check out
that<00:04:08.610> there<00:04:08.879> for<00:04:09.090> some<00:04:09.180> reason<00:04:09.420> when<00:04:09.510> i<00:04:09.540> put<00:04:10.019> a

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
that there for some reason when i put a

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.900 
that there for some reason when i put a
lot<00:04:10.200> of<00:04:10.230> volume<00:04:10.500> on<00:04:10.890> my<00:04:11.310> shoulders<00:04:11.670> they<00:04:11.790> will

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
lot of volume on my shoulders they will

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.559 
lot of volume on my shoulders they will
respond<00:04:12.329> now<00:04:12.810> understand<00:04:13.260> wise<00:04:13.410> because<00:04:13.859> uh

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
respond now understand wise because uh

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.120 
respond now understand wise because uh
your<00:04:15.569> shoulders<00:04:15.930> are<00:04:15.989> also<00:04:16.169> slows<00:04:16.680> muscle

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
your shoulders are also slows muscle

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.189 
your shoulders are also slows muscle
fibers<00:04:17.430> so<00:04:17.970> conclusion<00:04:18.780> it<00:04:18.870> pretty<00:04:19.049> much<00:04:19.169> is

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
fibers so conclusion it pretty much is

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.370 
fibers so conclusion it pretty much is
that<00:04:19.350> you<00:04:19.799> have<00:04:20.489> to<00:04:20.760> your<00:04:21.720> chest<00:04:21.959> for<00:04:22.109> example

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
that you have to your chest for example

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.719 
that you have to your chest for example
as<00:04:22.440> a<00:04:22.470> fastest<00:04:22.889> most<00:04:23.039> fiber<00:04:23.220> that's<00:04:23.490> why<00:04:23.580> your

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
as a fastest most fiber that's why your

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.279 
as a fastest most fiber that's why your
chest<00:04:23.940> we<00:04:24.030> gave<00:04:24.180> bacon<00:04:24.539> doing<00:04:24.780> five<00:04:25.020> to<00:04:25.169> eight

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
chest we gave bacon doing five to eight

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:28.010 
chest we gave bacon doing five to eight
reps<00:04:25.530> you<00:04:26.280> know<00:04:26.539> because<00:04:27.539> it's<00:04:27.660> the<00:04:27.720> fastest

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
reps you know because it's the fastest

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.230 
reps you know because it's the fastest
monster<00:04:28.139> fiber<00:04:28.500> in<00:04:28.740> if<00:04:28.889> you<00:04:28.979> know<00:04:29.010> it<00:04:29.240> responds

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
monster fiber in if you know it responds

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.050 
monster fiber in if you know it responds
better<00:04:30.419> to<00:04:30.510> low<00:04:30.720> reps<00:04:30.960> and<00:04:31.110> heavy<00:04:31.260> weights<00:04:31.530> and

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
better to low reps and heavy weights and

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.570 
better to low reps and heavy weights and
that<00:04:33.060> tells<00:04:33.330> me<00:04:33.500> that<00:04:34.500> now<00:04:34.979> i<00:04:35.010> understand<00:04:35.550> why

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
that tells me that now i understand why

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.610 
that tells me that now i understand why
my<00:04:35.789> chest<00:04:36.120> was<00:04:36.270> getting<00:04:36.600> big<00:04:36.780> and<00:04:37.020> my<00:04:37.229> traps

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
my chest was getting big and my traps

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.230 
my chest was getting big and my traps
and<00:04:37.860> shoulders<00:04:37.889> were<00:04:38.310> now<00:04:38.490> is<00:04:38.669> because<00:04:38.789> i<00:04:38.910> saw

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
and shoulders were now is because i saw

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.820 
and shoulders were now is because i saw
was<00:04:39.419> lifting<00:04:39.780> the<00:04:39.870> heavy<00:04:40.020> red<00:04:40.289> branch<00:04:40.530> and

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
was lifting the heavy red branch and

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.680 
was lifting the heavy red branch and
when<00:04:41.639> i<00:04:41.669> started<00:04:41.970> doing<00:04:42.090> that<00:04:42.270> higher<00:04:42.450> rep

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
when i started doing that higher rep

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.510 
when i started doing that higher rep
ranges<00:04:43.080> you<00:04:43.530> know<00:04:43.650> my<00:04:43.830> trap<00:04:44.070> started<00:04:44.370> growing

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
ranges you know my trap started growing

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.839 
ranges you know my trap started growing
my<00:04:44.610> scooter<00:04:45.000> started<00:04:45.270> going

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:45.849 
my scooter started going

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:47.999 
my scooter started going
you<00:04:46.179> know<00:04:46.270> so<00:04:46.509> it<00:04:46.689> gives<00:04:47.229> you<00:04:47.379> this<00:04:47.499> loose<00:04:47.709> your

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:48.009 
you know so it gives you this loose your

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:50.549 
you know so it gives you this loose your
body<00:04:48.189> uses<00:04:48.429> those<00:04:48.639> signals<00:04:49.119> so<00:04:50.080> pretty<00:04:50.499> much

00:04:50.549 --> 00:04:50.559 
body uses those signals so pretty much

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:52.859 
body uses those signals so pretty much
conclusion<00:04:51.129> is<00:04:51.279> you<00:04:51.580> should<00:04:52.209> train<00:04:52.419> your<00:04:52.629> slow

00:04:52.859 --> 00:04:52.869 
conclusion is you should train your slow

00:04:52.869 --> 00:04:54.719 
conclusion is you should train your slow
twitch<00:04:53.139> muscle<00:04:53.499> fibers<00:04:53.529> with<00:04:54.099> double<00:04:54.639> the

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
twitch muscle fibers with double the

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:56.879 
twitch muscle fibers with double the
volume<00:04:54.939> and<00:04:55.899> she<00:04:56.080> doing<00:04:56.289> in<00:04:56.409> your<00:04:56.499> fastest

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889 
volume and she doing in your fastest

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:58.079 
volume and she doing in your fastest
most<00:04:57.039> fabrics<00:04:57.279> like<00:04:57.490> for<00:04:57.669> example<00:04:57.729> a<00:04:57.939> person

00:04:58.079 --> 00:04:58.089 
most fabrics like for example a person

00:04:58.089 --> 00:05:00.329 
most fabrics like for example a person
like<00:04:58.330> me<00:04:58.509> should<00:04:59.499> be<00:04:59.589> training<00:04:59.830> his<00:05:00.039> traps

00:05:00.329 --> 00:05:00.339 
like me should be training his traps

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:02.159 
like me should be training his traps
with<00:05:00.939> twice<00:05:01.240> as<00:05:01.270> much<00:05:01.539> volume<00:05:01.779> as<00:05:02.050> the

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
with twice as much volume as the

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:03.359 
with twice as much volume as the
training<00:05:02.499> his<00:05:02.589> chest<00:05:02.830> which<00:05:02.979> is<00:05:03.069> not<00:05:03.219> the<00:05:03.339> case

00:05:03.359 --> 00:05:03.369 
training his chest which is not the case

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:05.399 
training his chest which is not the case
like<00:05:04.059> I<00:05:04.149> turn<00:05:04.389> my<00:05:04.509> chest<00:05:04.749> for<00:05:04.809> summit<00:05:05.080> volume

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:05.409 
like I turn my chest for summit volume

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:07.350 
like I turn my chest for summit volume
and<00:05:05.619> my<00:05:06.009> trust<00:05:06.279> for<00:05:06.399> like<00:05:06.550> no<00:05:06.729> volume<00:05:06.969> and<00:05:07.300> I

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
and my trust for like no volume and I

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.159 
and my trust for like no volume and I
was<00:05:07.479> wondering<00:05:07.779> why<00:05:07.899> they<00:05:08.020> weren't

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
was wondering why they weren't

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.169 
was wondering why they weren't
responding<00:05:08.619> love<00:05:09.399> with<00:05:09.520> my<00:05:09.610> other<00:05:09.699> body<00:05:09.939> from

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:10.179 
responding love with my other body from

00:05:10.179 --> 00:05:11.760 
responding love with my other body from
all<00:05:10.270> the<00:05:10.419> lag<00:05:10.629> and<00:05:10.779> by<00:05:10.869> default<00:05:11.020> so<00:05:11.589> it's<00:05:11.679> very

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
all the lag and by default so it's very

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.049 
all the lag and by default so it's very
important<00:05:12.129> to<00:05:12.159> train<00:05:12.399> your<00:05:13.110> each<00:05:14.110> muscle<00:05:15.059> the

00:05:16.049 --> 00:05:16.059 
important to train your each muscle the

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:17.820 
important to train your each muscle the
way<00:05:16.209> it<00:05:16.270> should<00:05:16.360> be<00:05:16.509> trained<00:05:16.839> and<00:05:17.319> doing<00:05:17.679> that

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
way it should be trained and doing that

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.199 
way it should be trained and doing that
cycle<00:05:18.189> that<00:05:18.279> me<00:05:18.429> and<00:05:18.519> Michael<00:05:18.819> doing<00:05:19.089> like

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:19.209 
cycle that me and Michael doing like

00:05:19.209 --> 00:05:20.909 
cycle that me and Michael doing like
five<00:05:19.389> to<00:05:19.539> eight<00:05:19.689> for<00:05:19.959> four<00:05:20.169> weeks<00:05:20.349> and<00:05:20.559> on<00:05:20.740> and

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 
five to eight for four weeks and on and

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:22.739 
five to eight for four weeks and on and
on<00:05:20.979> we're<00:05:21.669> able<00:05:21.789> to<00:05:21.999> find<00:05:22.179> that<00:05:22.330> this<00:05:22.449> thing<00:05:22.719> is

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:22.749 
on we're able to find that this thing is

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:24.419 
on we're able to find that this thing is
really<00:05:23.050> true<00:05:23.289> it's<00:05:23.529> not<00:05:23.589> true<00:05:23.740> sir<00:05:24.009> that's<00:05:24.279> not

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:24.429 
really true it's not true sir that's not

00:05:24.429 --> 00:05:26.339 
really true it's not true sir that's not
just<00:05:24.789> a<00:05:24.879> random<00:05:25.509> scientific<00:05:25.929> find<00:05:26.139> these

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:26.349 
just a random scientific find these

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:28.829 
just a random scientific find these
things<00:05:26.559> true<00:05:26.740> because<00:05:27.009> the<00:05:27.849> cycle<00:05:28.599> that<00:05:28.689> we're

00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:28.839 
things true because the cycle that we're

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:30.269 
things true because the cycle that we're
doing<00:05:28.959> five<00:05:29.229> to<00:05:29.379> eight<00:05:29.499> reps<00:05:29.709> really<00:05:30.099> heavy

chest and the lads are predominantly
fast<00:05:48.819> twitch<00:05:49.059> and<00:05:49.689> i<00:05:49.869> was<00:05:50.019> a<00:05:50.110> while<00:05:50.319> and

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:50.709 
fast twitch and i was a while and

fast twitch and i was a while and
another<00:05:50.979> thing<00:05:51.159> is<00:05:51.339> when<00:05:51.819> we're<00:05:51.999> doing<00:05:52.119> a<00:05:52.329> 15

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:52.659 
another thing is when we're doing a 15

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:54.899 
another thing is when we're doing a 15
to<00:05:52.719> 20<00:05:52.990> rep<00:05:53.139> range<00:05:53.379> our<00:05:53.589> shoulders<00:05:54.159> you<00:05:54.789> know

00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:54.909

to 20 rep range our shoulders you know
my<00:05:55.059> blue<00:05:55.619> they<00:05:56.619> fucking<00:05:56.949> blew<00:05:57.129> up<00:05:57.279> his<00:05:57.430> shit

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
my blue they fucking blew up his shit

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.069 
my blue they fucking blew up his shit
right<00:05:57.789> and<00:05:58.029> when<00:05:58.539> we<00:05:58.599> started<00:05:58.869> doing<00:05:58.930> the

00:05:59.069 --> 00:05:59.079 
right and when we started doing the

00:05:59.079 --> 00:06:01.199 
right and when we started doing the
faster<00:05:59.379> a<00:05:59.409> rep<00:05:59.680> branch<00:05:59.949> I<00:06:00.189> still<00:06:00.819> just<00:06:00.849> went

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:01.209 
faster a rep branch I still just went

00:06:01.209 --> 00:06:02.339 
faster a rep branch I still just went
back<00:06:01.360> to<00:06:01.539> like<00:06:01.659> the<00:06:01.779> way<00:06:01.809> they<00:06:01.959> used<00:06:01.990> to<00:06:02.199> look

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:02.349 
back to like the way they used to look

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:03.389 
back to like the way they used to look
and<00:06:02.499> it<00:06:02.589> was<00:06:02.680> I<00:06:02.860> was<00:06:02.979> trying<00:06:03.129> to<00:06:03.189> figure<00:06:03.249> out

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:03.399 
and it was I was trying to figure out

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:05.369 
and it was I was trying to figure out
why<00:06:03.579> then<00:06:04.180> I<00:06:04.300> went<00:06:04.479> to<00:06:04.689> the<00:06:04.809> that<00:06:05.139> with<00:06:05.259> that

00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:05.379 
why then I went to the that with that

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:07.230 
why then I went to the that with that
same<00:06:05.619> you<00:06:05.829> know

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240
