00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
you guys urban guys I would say he was

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.070 
you guys urban guys I would say he was
thinking<00:02:11.459> about<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.640> larger<00:02:12.090> 55-gallon<00:02:12.540> drums

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.790 
thinking about a larger 55-gallon drums
and<00:02:13.319> whatnot

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
and whatnot

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.000 
and whatnot
and<00:02:14.150> certainly<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:15.630> for<00:02:15.900> five<00:02:16.440> gallons<00:02:16.830> was

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
and certainly that for five gallons was

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.690 
and certainly that for five gallons was
20<00:02:17.990> 20<00:02:18.990> gallons<00:02:19.320> for<00:02:19.560> me<00:02:19.710> which<00:02:20.070> was<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:20.640> know

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
20 20 gallons for me which was you know

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.510 
20 20 gallons for me which was you know
a<00:02:20.760> second<00:02:21.390> tank<00:02:21.600> and<00:02:22.140> that<00:02:22.860> basically

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
a second tank and that basically

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.070 
a second tank and that basically
essentially<00:02:23.850> doubled<00:02:24.270> my<00:02:24.390> mileage<00:02:24.750> since<00:02:24.930> I

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
essentially doubled my mileage since I

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.510 
essentially doubled my mileage since I
didn't<00:02:25.260> let<00:02:25.380> my<00:02:25.530> tank<00:02:25.770> get<00:02:25.950> too<00:02:26.070> low

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
didn't let my tank get too low
