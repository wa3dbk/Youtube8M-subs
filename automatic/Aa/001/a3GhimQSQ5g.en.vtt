00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.680
 an island 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.680
 a sleep disorder 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.980
 oh the youtuber 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.970
 90 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.450
 what exactly is tube clash that my new one 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.580
 animation project in which it is about 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.620
 to lock eight youtuber on an island 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.300
 who then fight each other 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.130
 fight each other until after only 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.920
 one more thing remains 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.930
 very funny and with great involvement 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.450
 of the audience because in the end there is 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.340
 at the beginning of 20 youtuber from the the 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.870
 audience selects first eight people and 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.710
 decides who comes first 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.690
 on this island 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.400
 then decide who gets into which 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.600
 teams and then continue to decide 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.400
 what happens between now 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.260
 the youtube who gets along well with 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.850
 whoever beats will because of the head 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.140
 what are people arguing about? 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.759
 so it's the audience afterwards 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.400
 most important thing in this whole thing because 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:12.350
 he practically in the figurative sense that 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.070
 script writes and how is your result 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.600
 expanded 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.490
 the result itself consists of three 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.410
 main parts first part is the 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.990
 social life who quarrels with whom 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.850
 who might come up with that more 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.860
 Everything was completely determined with yes us 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.930
 are very dependent of course from the 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.210
 ideas and yes I think that we are cool 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.040
 the second part is about the 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.720
 Challenges that also determines who you are 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.549
 comes in a challenge the challenges 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.650
 that way out yes you can maybe 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.479
 compare with jungle testing though 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.490
 everything much much much more effort 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.049
 though how easy the possibilities of 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.000
 The animation have no big robots 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.890
 nobody bring me in 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.110
 You can play funniest players easily 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.400
 organize and yes I think that will 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.770
 that's what's going to happen again 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.960
 super cool and the third part as already 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.420
 indicated is the voting bad where you 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.770
 chooses who gets the most mood 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.630
 who comes in the challenge in the 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.369
 next week and also who gets the 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.510
 least votes who flies out we 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.100
 have that already a concept so how to 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.750
 The whole thing in any case so fair 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.580
 not the one with the most 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.619
 subscribers in any case anyway 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.209
 first place is and not automatically 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.350
 the last one immediately in the first episode 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.420
 So the one with the fewest flies out 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.580
 subscribers around the whole as well as fair 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.120
 and super entertaining so much 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.830
 to build the ship 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.019
 that's awesome what happens with 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.299
 the winner of tube cnt last of the 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:27.180
 Of course, the winner is left over 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:30.060
 by tube clash 2014 season 1 and the 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.250
 gets a fat survival package and 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.019
 I do not know yet 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.519
 what will be in that then also will be 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.319
 you again determine in the course of the 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.220
 yes, there will be no running 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.049
 Gags arise 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.700
 any funny situations and 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.799
 any innuendo will be in 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.540
 packed this backpack on top of it 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:47.909
 I like to grease my cup and all that will happen 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.010
 to the winner youtuber in real 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:51.660
 handy and I want that too 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.370
 a part and why do you have one now? 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.959
 crowdfunding project why am I doing 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.569
 not just other youtubers again 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.640
 just a youtube series so the thing 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.170
 is that the whole thing is very complex 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.079
 very tall and of course that's great 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.459
 want to do professionally, therefore, 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.920
 animations really need theirs 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.930
 time and I will work every week 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.489
 I have to go to the weekend one 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.440
 The result can be brought online 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.700
 For nine weeks, that means that 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.650
 New weeks I spend every day 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.519
 I'm curious and hardly any other projects 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.250
 can also accept 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.190
 For this we want a professional 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.220
 background drawing really did 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.269
 hire a specialist for 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.000
 the third painting 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.040
 we need a cool catchy in 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.569
 like everything that stays in the ear 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.010
 we really want that cool and stuff 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.709
 make it as professional as possible 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.930
 that we too professional shot up 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.069
 youtube have really over weeks 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.680
 go and so what not just on TV 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.209
 that's the vision behind it and that 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.569
 why I raise it all so big 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.459
 would like to 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.079
 the visionary, what happens to more 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.150
 remember when we engaging more money 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.680
 achieved here then have stated 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.299
 we use the money all the way 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.549
 broadcast cooler to make bigger 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:58.440
 we will make two more people 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.989
 that means that we are in the 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.730
 end effect 10 youtuber have on the 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.620
 There are five in each island 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.669
 of course two shows come to that 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.769
 It will be another two weeks 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:09.090
 extends two showdowns that 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.769
 evaluate the whole thing again 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.870
 because again two characters to it 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.549
 come as we youtuber yes too 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.139
 so pretend like they do 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:18.510
 but really are over the top and 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.739
 in the funny way that offers 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.349
 simply much more conflict potential 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.980
 so among all the people and yes me 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:26.620
 I think that will be real 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.450
 very epic and very funny that belief 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.430
 But I also have something in concrete terms 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.980
 if I donate what you from the whole 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:36.010
 Of course you are 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:38.140
 gets a super cool show over nine 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.880
 maybe eleven weeks on youtube 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.500
 exclusive youtube and here you get it 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.360
 your donations are still small 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.720
 For example, we have gifts 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.730
 deliberate postcards buttons 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.170
 the schostag sketches if you are away 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.300
 you will become of the project too 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.880
 seen in the block what I always do new 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.920
 What new discotheque no matter what I can 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.840
 So the tube will become reality 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.970
 Now it is important that you do that 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.220
 Whole out in the world carries recycled 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.690
 and yes, if possible, to the big ones 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.000
 youtuber request you are 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:10.830
 in the end yes the figures in this in 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.330
 this show and become involuntary 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.560
 weeks long talk here so in 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.450
 It does not matter if you are 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.830
 subsequently donate a complete fortune 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.210
 or a small mini amount then 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.800
 important is really that the thing 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.060
 first is supported for yours 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.120
 Of course I thank you for your support 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.550
 even now and then press 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.170
 We fix the thumb that the target sum 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.570
 everything that goes over it is achieved 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:34.570
 also cool if the whole thing anyway 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:37.770
 can continue and yes I thank you 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:40.810
 me with you and presses the thumb and 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.820
 hope that we will be very fast 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:46.330
 reunion with the first episode of 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:49.720
 tube player so it is now up down 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:52.710
 startnext DE / and what would have in common 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.710
 to line up 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.180
 already over
