so I'm starting here up on the 15th fret
on<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.830> e-string<00:01:35.450> I'm<00:01:36.450> picking<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:36.840> first

on the e-string I'm picking that first
note<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.650> then<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.340> do<00:01:38.460> pull<00:01:38.850> offs<00:01:39.090> on<00:01:39.440> the<00:01:40.440> next

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.950 
note and then I do pull offs on the next
two<00:01:40.800> notes<00:01:42.800> and<00:01:44.420> then<00:01:45.420> I'll<00:01:45.510> go<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.660> the<00:01:45.780> B

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
two notes and then I'll go to the B

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.860 
two notes and then I'll go to the B
string<00:01:46.260> and<00:01:46.410> do<00:01:46.800> a<00:01:46.830> pull<00:01:47.040> off<00:01:47.220> from<00:01:47.580> here<00:01:50.870> then

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
string and do a pull off from here then

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.490

and then B string with AB and I apply a

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.860 
and then B string with AB and I apply a
vibrato<00:02:02.700> there<00:02:03.000> too<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.240> quick<00:02:03.570> one<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:05.870> then

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
vibrato there too a quick one and then

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.210

back to the E string 12 fret B string

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.760 
back to the E string 12 fret B string
pull<00:02:11.760> off<00:02:11.880> again<00:02:13.790> and<00:02:14.790> then<00:02:15.240> g-string<00:02:16.110> 14th

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
pull off again and then g-string 14th

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.250 
pull off again and then g-string 14th

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
on the twelfth fret on the g string so

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:37.800 
on the twelfth fret on the g string so
together<00:02:25.080> we<00:02:25.290> get

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.899 

and<00:02:37.959> when<00:02:38.920> I<00:02:38.950> play<00:02:39.159> this<00:02:39.310> note<00:02:41.549> this<00:02:42.549> Bend<00:02:42.790> here

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:42.909 
and when I play this note this Bend here

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:46.649 
and when I play this note this Bend here
I<00:02:43.090> often<00:02:44.019> do<00:02:44.200> a<00:02:44.230> little<00:02:44.469> bit<00:02:44.560> of<00:02:44.650> a<00:02:44.969> break<00:02:45.969> I'm

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:46.659 
I often do a little bit of a break I'm

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:51.690 
I often do a little bit of a break I'm
muting<00:02:47.049> the<00:02:47.200> g<00:02:47.590> string<00:02:47.889> above<00:02:50.400> sometimes<00:02:51.400> even

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
muting the g string above sometimes even

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.220 
muting the g string above sometimes even
the<00:02:51.819> D<00:02:52.000> string<00:02:52.299> and<00:02:52.389> and<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.900> g<00:02:53.049> string

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
the D string and and the g string

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.140 
the D string and and the g string
because<00:02:56.230> it<00:02:56.349> makes<00:02:56.530> for<00:02:57.129> a<00:02:57.189> cool<00:02:57.730> way<00:02:58.120> to

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
because it makes for a cool way to

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.259 
because it makes for a cool way to
approach<00:02:58.719> that<00:02:58.930> note<00:03:00.750> it's<00:03:01.750> very<00:03:01.810> subtle<00:03:02.079> but

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
approach that note it's very subtle but

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.970 
approach that note it's very subtle but
it<00:03:04.269> sits<00:03:04.569> there<00:03:04.989> and<00:03:05.200> then<00:03:05.650> I<00:03:05.680> apply<00:03:05.950> that

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
it sits there and then I apply that

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:15.479 
it sits there and then I apply that
vibrato<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:13.750> this<00:03:14.530> note<00:03:14.709> you<00:03:14.739> can<00:03:15.010> bend<00:03:15.189> up<00:03:15.310> as

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
vibrato and this note you can bend up as

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.970 
vibrato and this note you can bend up as
much<00:03:15.700> as<00:03:15.909> you<00:03:16.000> want<00:03:16.230> but<00:03:17.230> not<00:03:17.379> more<00:03:17.709> than<00:03:17.919> a

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
much as you want but not more than a

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.589 
much as you want but not more than a
whole<00:03:18.159> step<00:03:20.790> that's<00:03:21.790> a<00:03:21.909> whole<00:03:22.090> step<00:03:22.299> but<00:03:22.510> if

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
whole step that's a whole step but if

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.949 
whole step that's a whole step but if
you<00:03:22.689> want<00:03:22.840> to<00:03:22.900> do<00:03:22.989> yes<00:03:23.139> to<00:03:23.319> half<00:03:23.469> step<00:03:24.780> it<00:03:25.780> works

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
you want to do yes to half step it works

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.369 
you want to do yes to half step it works
fine<00:03:26.169> this<00:03:26.700> just<00:03:27.700> fine<00:03:27.879> as<00:03:28.030> well<00:03:28.150> okay<00:03:28.900> so<00:03:28.959> one

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:29.379 
fine this just fine as well okay so one

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:31.530 
fine this just fine as well okay so one
more<00:03:29.500> time
