 I bring them to earth c's up I do not know why 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:33.810
 what says marvel universe reach to see 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.340
 I do not understand the truth I had not seen 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.200
 because the group yes will possibly be 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.380
 general general who wants to generalize 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.690
 the entire universe of marvel law itself and 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.460
 this one is from the series of good racks let's go 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.590
 to do the unboxing let's see their 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.660
 features I hope you are very 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.490
 well so be it without more and less without 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.760
 is not to lose me so much we're going to 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.560
 open it appears this fabulous the truth 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.210
 that is going to cut us off and not 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.070
 I find how to open it but good 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.910
 can open since it has a kind of 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.280
 dot 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:07.140
 and from there it came easy 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.479
 the purchase because I want to continue 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.700
 collecting marvel legends I want 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.400
 return again in charge I focused 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.799
 a lot to collect and someone came out 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.190
 better it comes out, I dedicated myself to 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.710
 collect then marvel cl says quite 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.310
 of disc and many other series like 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:31.229
 gremlins of many many cartoons 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:34.110
 movies already know turtles in boxing 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.880
 let's move on to the figure that is what 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.880
 we are interested 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:52.979
 and they will see in the following video 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.960
 move I do not have much to talk about good 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.990
 and we are going to see characteristics these are 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.330
 look fabulous and are Cufflinks the 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.920
 face look at him he looks wow looks 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.690
 fantastic is well detailed I do not 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.840
 leave the camera that will do that much 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:12.739
 although it looks good 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.989
 but look at the smile the fangs the 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:18.379
 eyes the face painting well the 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.819
 paint on your chest on your feet this 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.489
 fabulous and you feel a plastic 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:26.150
 squishy is very father or is it feels 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:28.580
 to the touch feels father this this guy 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.739
 of plastics with this figure they know to 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.700
 who reminds me that this camera does not 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:36.319
 leave the marvel the legends I'm 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.150
 vince the truth simarro with a little 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.129
 in the plastic type but not the 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.670
 Modeling modeling is still very 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:46.519
 simple a little bit a bit not quite smooth 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.130
 with only its details in the 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.140
 muscles is something that you many 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.970
 sometimes I did not have to have an excellent 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.190
 detail that is what you do not have right now 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:59.540
 but good this camera that is not left 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:02.360
 there is that is this one of the extensions 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.099
 of his arms do not stay fixed I thought 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.739
 that could possibly stay fixed 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:09.950
 and they do some kind of things like to 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:12.019
 those who have the sentinel is that way 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.480
 was fixed and these do not mine is what 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:17.900
 I did not like a bit of him 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.239
 in the channel of heaven and if he said that the 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.560
 belt does not fit so much is not like no 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.720
 they are showing for example in the 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.110
 illustration that is here look at is one 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.450
 of the comics equal is a smooth design 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.090
 complete and here they come this tells me that 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.160
 is the mold of another figure by telling me if 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.019
 it is true they are very right friend no 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.489
 it has movement here in the legs and 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.290
 upwards downwards to the sides 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.379
 not on the knees two points of 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.390
 articulation here rotates 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:45.500
 his crotch just like here moves 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.410
 but I feel that I have a hard time 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.989
 move it as you can see the waist in your 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.640
 abdomen in the chest not in the arms that 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:56.599
 is what we like about these figures of 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.090
 marvel leave what I know if this class 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.799
 increase I do not know why I like it quite 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.230
 apart it comes has a has a 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.790
 articulation here this articulation here 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:09.470
 he is very father of two points of 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:11.959
 joint was on his elbow in this 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.090
 arm in the hand not for that reason for these 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.549
 things that do not help you move and in the 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.769
 head look down excellent towards 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.139
 up same excellent I really like the 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.449
 face is on that figure let's go 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.759
 what kinds of positions can I do 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:27.139
 We're going over there 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:31.069
 a column of the courses that help us 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:32.300
 to position their characteristics and I 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:33.830
 I'm realizing that I do not help her 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.840
 nothing to have that hand there if you do not 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.759
 can move so much and these are still 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.409
 fatalities can not be accommodated and if 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:41.389
 was this distance from wolverine and 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:42.650
 what constrictor was grabbing 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:49.370
 wolverine then the pri I did not want it 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:56.150
 cut his position was not found 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:57.469
 superior to hands and does not handle weapons good 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.629
 Well, I do not know what I would like to do 

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:04.099
 with the only wanted higher would be 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:07.400
 disappear they sing it there it was like this 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:09.439
 easy another position of against archangel 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.719
 the truth that has cost me a lot 

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:14.240
 work position the but means 

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:16.669
 local who is enjoying this these 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.990
 new positions possibly for me 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:21.200
 archangel that is what I wanted to have value 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:25.440
 dance and down 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:27.570
 and to give you last point of view I 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.520
 it costs too much work to put it in spite 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.230
 that you have too many joints and 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.050
 that the plastic feels similar to 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:36.360
 of davis is a disadvantage in this 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.400
 because the detail felt soft 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.640
 It was firmer and in this it does not cost me 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.530
 very much work position pay 300 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.420
 weights out there if you ask me were 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.520
 like 26 dollars or so to the 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:51.000
 conversion is a is pretty much like a 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.830
 13 pesos the dollar one something like that 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.660
 We are watching, I hope you have 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:58.050
 liked this video I do with my own 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:59.580
 saliva and take care of several but in 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.350
 the next video I hope you like it is 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:05.330
 also marvel or if it is me 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:05.330
 go through something else before we see you
