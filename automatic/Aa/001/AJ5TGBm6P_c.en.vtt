00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:09.870
 both agencies work the only thing that i'm not all that alone in this year 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.959
 changed after a few days on the knee to reclassification 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.759
 several years in a collision 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:20.460
 make a declaration arm arm pinch to work 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.930
 it will ask the regular visitors to the swimming pool atlantis schröder 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.359
 that old pekela can continue to swim 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.159
 but just out of their own in the hot tub the in a few years no longer 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:35.360
 the current swimming pool will be demolished and I will return to the so-called instruction pool 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.660
 it becomes a stop to the property without a slide and without a bubble bath 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.790
 intention is to have one 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.920
 instruction bath to go and peter hustinx between that 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.020
 after eating 15 meters wide from Zevenhoven 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.170
 but in fact we can do everything where we now also end up freeing through a ball 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.610
 months of recreational swimming 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.370
 So the target groups that are there now can weather that can stay there 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.789
 all target groups that are now there 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:58.930
 can just stay 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.930
 this applies, for example, to these people who suffer from heart disease 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.880
 the 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.880
 haha 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.810
 according to a recent school swimming, the new bid will remain possible 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.230
 according to the director of the country it is a major intervention 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.370
 it is a major loss for the residents of the Pekela municipality 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.790
 that means for the staff 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.810
 that will certainly also have consequences for ours in particular 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:27.930
 Staff members 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.920
 because people have to leave 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.020
 So there may not be a future, but I can imagine that you will 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.990
 with your staff 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.020
 then you must be in full swing 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.140
 according to the municipality of pekela, intervention is necessary 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.400
 maintaining that country to its full extent is far too expensive 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.450
 a lot of money can be saved with the new bath 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.220
 the further cortebeeck mine 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.650
 rounded approximately 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.700
 7 8 tons per year the rich to a new foot the new pool costs 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.720
 two tons per year 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.660
 give a cut of at least half a million and unnecessary in these times 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.350
 the construction costs of the new bid are estimated at € 7 million in a coma 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.660
 in January 2011, that country will be closed for a year for demolition and new construction 

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.869
 the city council will decide on the plan in November
