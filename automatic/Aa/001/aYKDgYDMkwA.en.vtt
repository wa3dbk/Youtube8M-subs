00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.780 
hi guys this video is about the version
1.1<00:00:11.309> update<00:00:11.490> for<00:00:12.210> predator<00:00:12.809> vision<00:00:13.190> now<00:00:14.190> I

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
1.1 update for predator vision now I

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.599 
1.1 update for predator vision now I
have<00:00:15.360> added<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:15.900> few<00:00:16.049> things<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:16.920> have<00:00:17.100> fixed

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
have added a few things and I have fixed

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.290 
have added a few things and I have fixed
a<00:00:17.820> few<00:00:18.150> things<00:00:19.039> the<00:00:20.039> first<00:00:20.460> thing<00:00:20.760> i<00:00:20.910> did<00:00:20.970> was<00:00:21.240> i

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
a few things the first thing i did was i

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.080 
a few things the first thing i did was i
fixed<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:21.810> so<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:22.080> when<00:00:22.260> your<00:00:22.800> race<00:00:23.250> changes

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
fixed it so that when your race changes

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.029 
fixed it so that when your race changes
so<00:00:24.300> for<00:00:24.420> example<00:00:24.510> if<00:00:24.750> you're<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.900> werewolf<00:00:25.199> it

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
so for example if you're a werewolf it

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.750 
so for example if you're a werewolf it
drops<00:00:26.609> night<00:00:27.210> vision<00:00:27.570> or<00:00:27.720> predator<00:00:28.320> vision<00:00:28.760> so

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
drops night vision or predator vision so

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.450 
drops night vision or predator vision so
you<00:00:30.449> won't<00:00:30.539> get<00:00:30.750> stuck<00:00:31.199> in<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.619> mode<00:00:31.920> so

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
you won't get stuck in that mode so

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.670 
you won't get stuck in that mode so
whenever<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.820> change<00:00:33.149> race<00:00:33.570> now<00:00:33.870> your<00:00:34.469> night

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
whenever you change race now your night

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.360 
whenever you change race now your night
vision<00:00:34.710> or<00:00:35.309> your<00:00:36.739> predator<00:00:37.739> vision<00:00:37.950> will<00:00:38.070> drop

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
vision or your predator vision will drop

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.860 
vision or your predator vision will drop
and<00:00:38.520> by<00:00:38.640> change<00:00:39.000> race<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.390> mean<00:00:39.570> change<00:00:39.809> from

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
and by change race I mean change from

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.020 
and by change race I mean change from
human<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.500> werewolf<00:00:40.950> or<00:00:41.129> human<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.000> vampire

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
human to werewolf or human to vampire

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.660 
human to werewolf or human to vampire
lord<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.780> back<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.710> change<00:00:44.040> will<00:00:44.280> cancel

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
lord and back that change will cancel

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.619 
lord and back that change will cancel
the<00:00:44.910> vision<00:00:45.329> I've<00:00:46.200> also<00:00:46.559> fixed<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:47.850> the

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
the vision I've also fixed it so the

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.170 
the vision I've also fixed it so the
effect<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.469> used<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.340> be<00:00:50.460> appearing<00:00:50.879> here

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
effect that used to be appearing here

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.680 
effect that used to be appearing here
saying<00:00:51.510> like<00:00:51.719> 999<00:00:52.289> days<00:00:53.030> has<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.420> now

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
saying like 999 days has is now

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.450 
saying like 999 days has is now
invisible<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.890> should<00:00:56.100> never<00:00:56.219> have

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
invisible and you should never have

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.040 
invisible and you should never have
worried<00:00:56.699> about<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.420> was<00:00:57.600> simply<00:00:58.020> a

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
worried about that that was simply a

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.639 
worried about that that was simply a
check<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:59.660> stopped<00:01:00.660> other<00:01:00.899> night<00:01:01.170> visions

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
check that stopped other night visions

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.429 
check that stopped other night visions
stacking<00:01:02.280> which<00:01:03.149> was<00:01:03.359> basically<00:01:03.989> supposed<00:01:04.350> to

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
stacking which was basically supposed to

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.420 
stacking which was basically supposed to
be<00:01:04.559> helpful<00:01:05.000> now<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.030> have<00:01:06.390> also<00:01:06.990> tweaked<00:01:07.530> the

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
be helpful now I have also tweaked the

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.210 
be helpful now I have also tweaked the
night<00:01:08.909> vision<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.420> little<00:01:09.689> bit<00:01:09.869> arm<00:01:10.220> especially

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
night vision a little bit arm especially

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.160 
night vision a little bit arm especially
with<00:01:11.790> regards<00:01:12.270> things<00:01:12.450> like<00:01:12.570> climates<00:01:13.080> of

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
with regards things like climates of

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.550 
with regards things like climates of
Tamriel<00:01:13.740> which<00:01:14.100> were<00:01:14.909> still<00:01:15.180> too<00:01:15.630> dark<00:01:16.049> with

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
Tamriel which were still too dark with

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.880 
Tamriel which were still too dark with
this<00:01:16.770> night<00:01:16.950> vision<00:01:17.280> mod<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:19.500> predator

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
this night vision mod and the predator

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.820 
this night vision mod and the predator
vision<00:01:20.130> was<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.310> little<00:01:20.700> bit<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:22.200> colors<00:01:22.710> were

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
vision was a little bit the colors were

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.609 
vision was a little bit the colors were
a<00:01:22.860> little<00:01:22.979> off<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.369> tweaked<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.619> I've

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
a little off so I tweaked it and I've

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.100 
a little off so I tweaked it and I've
actually<00:01:25.860> added<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.759> option<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:27.240> change<00:01:27.780> the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
actually added the option to change the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.640 
actually added the option to change the
values<00:01:29.000> if<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.090> go<00:01:30.270> along<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.840> MCN<00:01:31.290> menu

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
values if you go along to the MCN menu

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.020 
values if you go along to the MCN menu
for<00:01:31.829> predator<00:01:32.220> vision<00:01:32.460> there<00:01:32.729> is<00:01:32.850> now<00:01:33.000> a

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
for predator vision there is now a

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.090 
for predator vision there is now a
brightness<00:01:33.900> option<00:01:34.320> now<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.650> defaults<00:01:35.100> to

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
brightness option now it defaults to

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.010 
brightness option now it defaults to
fifty<00:01:35.610> percent<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.240> that's<00:01:36.750> what<00:01:36.900> you're

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
fifty percent and that's what you're

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.249 
fifty percent and that's what you're
seeing<00:01:37.290> right<00:01:37.380> now<00:01:38.060> so<00:01:39.060> I'm<00:01:39.119> going<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.479> turn

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
seeing right now so I'm going to turn

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.600 
seeing right now so I'm going to turn
off<00:01:40.500> that

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
off that

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.790 
off that
and<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:43.750> is<00:01:43.990> with<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:46.200> climates<00:01:47.200> of<00:01:47.260> Tamriel

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
and this is with the climates of Tamriel

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.060 
and this is with the climates of Tamriel
the<00:01:48.280> number<00:01:49.150> to<00:01:49.450> brighten<00:01:50.290> night<00:01:50.500> so<00:01:50.680> it's<00:01:50.800> not

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
the number to brighten night so it's not

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.350 
the number to brighten night so it's not
as<00:01:51.250> dark<00:01:51.580> as<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.920> normal<00:01:54.400> climates<00:01:55.300> of

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
as dark as the the normal climates of

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.110 
as dark as the the normal climates of
Tamriel<00:01:55.750> nights<00:01:56.050> and<00:01:56.440> fifty<00:01:57.310> percent<00:01:57.550> I<00:01:57.760> think

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
Tamriel nights and fifty percent I think

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.719 
Tamriel nights and fifty percent I think
is<00:01:58.300> good<00:01:58.810> enough<00:01:59.050> and<00:01:59.350> the<00:02:00.130> same<00:02:00.310> is<00:02:00.370> true<00:02:00.520> for

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
is good enough and the same is true for

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.130 
is good enough and the same is true for
the<00:02:00.910> predator<00:02:01.390> vision<00:02:01.660> if<00:02:01.750> you<00:02:01.840> look<00:02:01.960> at<00:02:02.080> the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
the predator vision if you look at the

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.960 
the predator vision if you look at the
credit<00:02:02.320> division<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:05.140> crabs<00:02:05.729> clearly<00:02:06.729> shown

now<00:02:07.240> very<00:02:07.690> very<00:02:07.900> easily<00:02:08.200> visibility<00:02:09.100> is<00:02:09.280> very

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
now very very easily visibility is very

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.949 
now very very easily visibility is very
good<00:02:10.090> indeed<00:02:10.709> now<00:02:11.820> here<00:02:12.820> we<00:02:13.000> are<00:02:13.030> with<00:02:13.510> the

of<00:02:21.160> climates<00:02:21.670> of<00:02:21.760> Tamriel<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:22.360> as<00:02:22.420> you<00:02:22.510> can

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
of climates of Tamriel and as you can

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.650 
of climates of Tamriel and as you can
see<00:02:22.690> it<00:02:23.080> is<00:02:23.290> dark<00:02:24.239> so<00:02:25.239> I'm<00:02:25.300> going<00:02:25.330> to<00:02:25.450> put<00:02:25.570> the

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
see it is dark so I'm going to put the

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.949 
see it is dark so I'm going to put the
night<00:02:25.840> vision<00:02:26.170> on<00:02:26.290> now<00:02:26.500> and<00:02:27.390> it's<00:02:28.390> pretty<00:02:28.750> good

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
night vision on now and it's pretty good

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.680 
night vision on now and it's pretty good
it's<00:02:29.110> an<00:02:29.230> improvement<00:02:29.560> on<00:02:29.920> what<00:02:30.760> it<00:02:31.570> was

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
it's an improvement on what it was

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.510 
it's an improvement on what it was
before<00:02:31.870> because<00:02:32.500> it<00:02:32.739> is<00:02:32.860> about<00:02:33.070> twenty

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
before because it is about twenty

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.860 
before because it is about twenty
percent<00:02:33.550> to<00:02:33.970> thirty<00:02:34.120> percent<00:02:34.330> brighter<00:02:34.660> than

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
percent to thirty percent brighter than

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.530 
percent to thirty percent brighter than
before<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:36.130> I've<00:02:36.310> also<00:02:36.489> increased<00:02:37.120> the

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
before and I've also increased the

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.680 
before and I've also increased the
clarity<00:02:38.350> and<00:02:38.790> saturation<00:02:39.790> so<00:02:40.300> that<00:02:40.480> should

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
clarity and saturation so that should

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.160 
clarity and saturation so that should
combat<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:42.010> climates<00:02:42.520> of<00:02:42.580> Tamriel<00:02:43.170> tendency

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
combat the climates of Tamriel tendency

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.110 
combat the climates of Tamriel tendency
to<00:02:44.320> dull<00:02:44.650> colors<00:02:45.300> and<00:02:46.300> the<00:02:46.690> creditor<00:02:47.410> vision

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
to dull colors and the creditor vision

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.340 
to dull colors and the creditor vision
was<00:02:49.120> pretty<00:02:49.360> good<00:02:49.950> however<00:02:51.480> in<00:02:52.480> case<00:02:52.780> this<00:02:53.170> is

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
was pretty good however in case this is

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.050 
was pretty good however in case this is
still<00:02:53.680> too<00:02:53.860> dark<00:02:54.100> for<00:02:54.160> you<00:02:54.280> and<00:02:54.489> if<00:02:54.610> when<00:02:54.940> it

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
still too dark for you and if when it

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.410 
still too dark for you and if when it
rains<00:02:55.450> it<00:02:55.870> gets<00:02:55.930> even<00:02:56.320> darker<00:02:56.709> you<00:02:57.549> you<00:02:58.060> could

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
rains it gets even darker you you could

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.640 
rains it gets even darker you you could
if<00:02:59.110> you<00:02:59.170> wished<00:03:00.150> push<00:03:01.150> that<00:03:01.330> value<00:03:01.720> all<00:03:02.260> the

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
if you wished push that value all the

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:03.750 
if you wished push that value all the
way<00:03:02.769> up<00:03:02.890> all<00:03:03.070> the<00:03:03.130> way<00:03:03.400> to<00:03:03.519> one<00:03:03.640> hundred

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
way up all the way to one hundred

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.100 
way up all the way to one hundred
percent<00:03:03.970> is<00:03:04.269> very<00:03:04.630> bright<00:03:04.959> indeed<00:03:05.459> but<00:03:07.110> maybe

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
percent is very bright indeed but maybe

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.800 
percent is very bright indeed but maybe
that's<00:03:08.320> how<00:03:08.410> you<00:03:08.470> like<00:03:08.650> it<00:03:09.360> it<00:03:10.360> will<00:03:10.540> basically

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
that's how you like it it will basically

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.330 
that's how you like it it will basically
make<00:03:11.200> it<00:03:11.530> as<00:03:11.650> bright<00:03:12.190> as<00:03:12.459> day<00:03:13.150> as<00:03:13.450> you<00:03:13.600> can<00:03:13.690> see

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
make it as bright as day as you can see

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.759 
make it as bright as day as you can see
my<00:03:15.340> vampire<00:03:15.910> can<00:03:16.209> now<00:03:16.420> see<00:03:16.780> in<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.260> dark<00:03:17.500> as

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
my vampire can now see in the dark as

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.370 
my vampire can now see in the dark as
well<00:03:18.580> as<00:03:18.700> a<00:03:18.730> human<00:03:19.209> can<00:03:19.480> in<00:03:19.720> the<00:03:19.840> day<00:03:20.019> and<00:03:20.230> that

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
well as a human can in the day and that

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.190 
well as a human can in the day and that
was<00:03:20.680> the<00:03:20.950> idea<00:03:21.070> of<00:03:21.310> this<00:03:21.549> mod<00:03:21.850> it<00:03:22.660> wasn't<00:03:23.049> just

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
was the idea of this mod it wasn't just

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.400 
was the idea of this mod it wasn't just
a<00:03:23.290> brief<00:03:23.560> help<00:03:24.420> vampires<00:03:25.420> were<00:03:25.810> creatures<00:03:25.870> of

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
a brief help vampires were creatures of

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.979 
a brief help vampires were creatures of
the<00:03:26.620> night<00:03:26.799> they<00:03:27.190> can<00:03:27.370> see<00:03:27.730> far<00:03:28.360> in<00:03:28.660> the<00:03:28.750> dark

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
the night they can see far in the dark

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.039 
the night they can see far in the dark
so<00:03:29.290> that<00:03:29.320> was<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:29.620> idea<00:03:29.739> and<00:03:30.160> of<00:03:30.700> course<00:03:31.049> the

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
so that was the idea and of course the

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.600 
so that was the idea and of course the
same<00:03:32.260> goes<00:03:32.320> for<00:03:33.040> the<00:03:33.130> predator<00:03:33.489> vision

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
same goes for the predator vision

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.040 
same goes for the predator vision
far<00:03:35.300> better<00:03:35.540> visibility<00:03:35.960> with<00:03:36.440> that<00:03:36.680> setting

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
far better visibility with that setting

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.240 
far better visibility with that setting
you<00:03:39.050> see<00:03:39.290> is<00:03:39.380> prey<00:03:39.740> from<00:03:40.010> a<00:03:40.130> long<00:03:40.520> way<00:03:42.190> okay<00:03:43.190> so

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
you see is prey from a long way okay so

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.730 
you see is prey from a long way okay so
back<00:03:43.580> to<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:43.880> vanilla<00:03:44.300> nights<00:03:44.570> level<00:03:45.230> two<00:03:45.500> or

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
back to the vanilla nights level two or

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.650 
back to the vanilla nights level two or
one<00:03:46.100> thing<00:03:46.460> I<00:03:46.580> would<00:03:46.700> like<00:03:46.730> to<00:03:46.880> mention<00:03:47.270> about

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
one thing I would like to mention about

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.320 
one thing I would like to mention about
climates<00:03:48.500> of<00:03:48.560> Tamriel<00:03:49.040> some<00:03:49.520> people<00:03:49.940> have

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
climates of Tamriel some people have

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.390 
climates of Tamriel some people have
reported<00:03:50.540> that<00:03:51.260> predator<00:03:52.040> vision<00:03:52.250> and

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
reported that predator vision and

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.670 
reported that predator vision and
climates<00:03:52.850> of<00:03:52.910> Tamriel<00:03:53.390> have<00:03:53.960> an<00:03:54.050> issue<00:03:54.230> where

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
climates of Tamriel have an issue where

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.090 
climates of Tamriel have an issue where
the<00:03:54.770> screen<00:03:55.100> goes<00:03:55.340> either<00:03:55.550> black<00:03:55.910> or<00:03:56.180> white

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
the screen goes either black or white

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.970 
the screen goes either black or white
but<00:03:58.100> from<00:03:58.550> what<00:03:58.610> I<00:03:58.760> can<00:03:58.880> see<00:03:59.440> this<00:04:00.440> seems<00:04:00.830> to

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
but from what I can see this seems to

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.670 
but from what I can see this seems to
only<00:04:01.190> happen<00:04:01.430> if<00:04:02.000> you<00:04:02.120> are<00:04:02.270> using<00:04:02.600> the<00:04:03.200> vanilla

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
only happen if you are using the vanilla

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.610 
only happen if you are using the vanilla
nights<00:04:04.010> three<00:04:04.850> plugin<00:04:05.780> not<00:04:06.230> sure<00:04:06.440> why<00:04:06.590> that

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
nights three plugin not sure why that

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.940 
nights three plugin not sure why that
would<00:04:06.980> be<00:04:07.220> I<00:04:08.080> haven't<00:04:09.080> tried<00:04:09.410> the<00:04:09.620> vanilla

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
would be I haven't tried the vanilla

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.100 
would be I haven't tried the vanilla
nights<00:04:10.190> for<00:04:10.760> plug-in<00:04:11.120> which<00:04:11.360> is<00:04:11.540> very<00:04:11.810> very

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
nights for plug-in which is very very

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.080 
nights for plug-in which is very very
bright<00:04:12.500> nights<00:04:12.830> so<00:04:13.430> I<00:04:13.459> would<00:04:13.670> only<00:04:13.760> recommend

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
bright nights so I would only recommend

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.420 
bright nights so I would only recommend
using<00:04:14.780> predator<00:04:15.290> vision<00:04:15.560> with<00:04:15.709> climates<00:04:16.340> of

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
using predator vision with climates of

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.569 
using predator vision with climates of

Tamriel if you are using the default

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.789 
Tamriel if you are using the default
very<00:04:19.579> dark<00:04:19.910> knight<00:04:20.209> or<00:04:20.480> vanilla<00:04:21.230> nights<00:04:21.500> one

of vanilla nights too to be honest with

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.110 
of vanilla nights too to be honest with

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
and four it's so bright you don't need

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.900 
and four it's so bright you don't need
night<00:04:28.730> vision<00:04:28.850> anyway<00:04:29.390> so<00:04:30.110> I<00:04:30.890> I<00:04:31.190> wouldn't<00:04:31.760> have

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
night vision anyway so I I wouldn't have

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.640 
night vision anyway so I I wouldn't have
it<00:04:32.030> much<00:04:32.450> brighter<00:04:33.050> than<00:04:33.350> two<00:04:33.650> so<00:04:35.080> the<00:04:36.080> the

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
it much brighter than two so the the

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.770 
it much brighter than two so the the
setting<00:04:37.040> can<00:04:37.340> actually<00:04:37.700> be<00:04:37.820> reduced<00:04:38.270> because

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
setting can actually be reduced because

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.320 
setting can actually be reduced because
it<00:04:39.260> did<00:04:39.500> occur<00:04:39.620> to<00:04:39.770> me<00:04:39.950> that<00:04:40.070> some<00:04:40.790> people

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
it did occur to me that some people

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.200 
it did occur to me that some people
would<00:04:41.660> like<00:04:41.930> this<00:04:42.200> mod<00:04:42.470> but<00:04:43.070> they<00:04:43.220> be<00:04:43.280> using<00:04:43.760> no

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
would like this mod but they be using no

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.670 
would like this mod but they be using no
lighting<00:04:44.540> mod<00:04:44.900> they<00:04:45.169> be<00:04:45.229> using<00:04:45.620> the<00:04:45.800> vanilla

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
lighting mod they be using the vanilla

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.380 
lighting mod they be using the vanilla
night<00:04:48.680> which<00:04:49.010> are<00:04:49.190> bright<00:04:49.580> enough<00:04:49.610> anyway<00:04:50.240> but

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
night which are bright enough anyway but

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.540 
night which are bright enough anyway but
they<00:04:50.510> like<00:04:50.750> the<00:04:50.990> predator<00:04:51.260> vision<00:04:51.830> they<00:04:52.220> like

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
they like the predator vision they like

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.100 
they like the predator vision they like
the<00:04:52.760> concept<00:04:53.090> of<00:04:53.270> seeing<00:04:53.540> their<00:04:53.750> prey<00:04:54.050> but

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
the concept of seeing their prey but

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.140 
the concept of seeing their prey but
they<00:04:54.320> don't<00:04:54.560> want<00:04:54.800> to<00:04:54.890> be<00:04:54.979> blinded<00:04:55.700> in<00:04:55.880> the

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
they don't want to be blinded in the

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.210 
they don't want to be blinded in the
vanilla<00:04:56.479> nights<00:04:56.780> which<00:04:57.020> are<00:04:57.290> as<00:04:57.500> I<00:04:57.590> said<00:04:57.830> very

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
vanilla nights which are as I said very

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.940 
vanilla nights which are as I said very
bright<00:04:58.580> so<00:04:59.210> as<00:04:59.270> you<00:04:59.360> can<00:04:59.450> see<00:04:59.660> this<00:05:00.500> is<00:05:00.710> a<00:05:00.740> very

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
bright so as you can see this is a very

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.400 
bright so as you can see this is a very
weak<00:05:01.430> night<00:05:02.000> vision<00:05:02.419> it's<00:05:02.870> a<00:05:02.930> very<00:05:03.169> very

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
weak night vision it's a very very

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.310 
weak night vision it's a very very
subtle<00:05:03.830> night<00:05:03.979> vision<00:05:04.310> now<00:05:04.790> and<00:05:05.120> the<00:05:05.600> predator

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
subtle night vision now and the predator

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.600 
subtle night vision now and the predator
vision<00:05:06.530> will<00:05:06.680> work<00:05:06.860> but<00:05:07.190> it<00:05:07.310> won't<00:05:07.490> be

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
vision will work but it won't be

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.590 
vision will work but it won't be
blinding<00:05:08.360> on<00:05:08.570> vanilla<00:05:09.140> obviously<00:05:10.300> not<00:05:11.300> that

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
blinding on vanilla obviously not that

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.650 
blinding on vanilla obviously not that
good<00:05:11.870> for<00:05:12.140> a<00:05:12.729> mod<00:05:13.729> that<00:05:13.760> gives<00:05:14.060> dark<00:05:14.360> nights

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
good for a mod that gives dark nights

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.070 
good for a mod that gives dark nights

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.330 
number of people said they weren't that

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.960 
number of people said they weren't that
keen<00:06:08.540> on<00:06:08.600> that<00:06:08.750> but<00:06:09.020> I'm<00:06:09.080> afraid<00:06:09.700> you're<00:06:10.700> not

keen on that but I'm afraid you're not

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:16.430 
dead you are not cold-blooded so maybe

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.310 
dead you are not cold-blooded so maybe
you're<00:06:16.670> only<00:06:16.940> go<00:06:17.150> first<00:06:17.390> person<00:06:17.750> anyway<00:06:18.260> so

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:18.320 
you're only go first person anyway so

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.190 
you're only go first person anyway so
you<00:06:18.500> now<00:06:18.830> have<00:06:18.860> that<00:06:19.460> option<00:06:19.700> if<00:06:20.120> you<00:06:20.480> so<00:06:20.840> wish

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:21.200 
you now have that option if you so wish

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.190 
you now have that option if you so wish
i'm<00:06:21.740> not<00:06:22.070> sure<00:06:22.310> i<00:06:22.570> will<00:06:23.570> be<00:06:23.720> using<00:06:23.870> that<00:06:24.140> i

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:24.200 
i'm not sure i will be using that i

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.230 
i'm not sure i will be using that i
haven't<00:06:24.500> decided<00:06:24.890> yet<00:06:25.310> it<00:06:25.760> is<00:06:25.970> very

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240 
haven't decided yet it is very

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.630 
haven't decided yet it is very
convenient<00:06:26.660> i<00:06:26.990> must<00:06:27.230> admit<00:06:27.500> and<00:06:27.740> you<00:06:28.370> could

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:28.640 
convenient i must admit and you could

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.840 
convenient i must admit and you could
argue<00:06:28.880> that<00:06:29.270> the<00:06:30.020> werewolf<00:06:30.410> keeps<00:06:30.710> his<00:06:31.340> senses

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:31.850 
argue that the werewolf keeps his senses

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.180 
argue that the werewolf keeps his senses
when<00:06:32.000> in<00:06:32.120> human<00:06:32.480> form<00:06:32.750> i<00:06:33.110> believe<00:06:33.770> a<00:06:33.800> lot<00:06:34.160> of

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.190 
when in human form i believe a lot of

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.500 
when in human form i believe a lot of
the<00:06:34.520> will<00:06:34.940> werewolf<00:06:35.540> stories<00:06:35.990> did<00:06:36.260> have<00:06:36.500> their

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:37.510 
the will werewolf stories did have their

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.300 
the will werewolf stories did have their
the<00:06:38.510> werewolves<00:06:38.990> having<00:06:39.320> heightened<00:06:39.890> senses

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:40.310 
the werewolves having heightened senses

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:41.980 
the werewolves having heightened senses
in<00:06:40.430> human<00:06:40.730> form<00:06:40.880> but<00:06:41.060> that<00:06:41.180> is<00:06:41.270> up<00:06:41.420> to<00:06:41.570> you<00:06:41.750> now

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:41.990 
in human form but that is up to you now
