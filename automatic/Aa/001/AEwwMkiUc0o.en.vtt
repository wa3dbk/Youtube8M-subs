00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:18.300
 I will now present a way of 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:21.750
 use the larger scale in a way 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.070
 different to our improvisations 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:29.189
 we know that within the harmonic field 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.890
 for example we have credited the 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.930
 tribe will believe only as a trail of 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:39.989
 is considered to be our 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.960
 judgment with the seventh largest and I go 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.350
 use the actress on the first and 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.789
 track of fifth grade I will not 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:55.500
 use it the 4th grade 1 to 4 final 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.360
 coordinate better then I will use the crisis 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.530
 on the first and on the nursery 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.699
 fifth with two reference points 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.699
 to our impromptu 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.630
 if it was bigger 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.840
 turning the tone of the largest and using 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.770
 therefore the sister on the dollar under the 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.000
 Sun 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:43.060
 The great trick is to use each one 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:58.290
 of each of the threads itself 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:58.290
 School beautiful about rep 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:14.760
 about morning 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:14.760
 the program since it went bankrupt 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.750
 this is therefore an interesting resource 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:46.319
 because it allows us instead of thinking about 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:49.980
 scale on thinking less about two points 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:54.530
 different to our improvisations 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.530
 let's assume E-flat with the seventh largest 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:12.139
 I used the triad on the first grade and the 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:12.139
 use meets up 1 500 will mix 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.750
 soccer 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.040
 ae 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.360
