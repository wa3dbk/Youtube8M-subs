00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:11.180
 welcome to the new tutorial let's go 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.180
 now to apply the cars 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.940
 to show 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:19.580
 normally what comes in the drumsticks 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:22.369
 they are two set of calcium-only stickers 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.040
 and those that come in the blue sheet are the 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:29.210
 of cases to water and these are the 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:31.610
 stickers by the standard is not a norm 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.370
 but it usually comes in the blue sheet 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:38.449
 of cannes and the green stickers but to 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:41.300
 sometimes it's not like that and they would have to 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:46.500
 I distinguish not know if it will reach 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:52.230
 see here on the camera the stickers have 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:54.540
 is the sticker cut is marked 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.300
 the piece is reached wish to see in the 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:01.070
 recording if they reach to see that the cut 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:04.150
 is marked means that it is 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.570
 the sticker 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.090
 it's practically a game that I eat 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.380
 can see 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.380
 almost identical 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:22.200
 but often more details come 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:25.829
 among us they will also find 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.640
 1 set of cash witnesses to make 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:28.640
 some details 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:36.810
 in all models it will come 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.910
 somewhere in the instructions for 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.430
 paste the stickers here for example 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:45.210
 appear the two sheets that already 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.150
 we show and come the numbers where it goes 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.970
 to apply to each one 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:53.470
 in the case of us we are going to apply 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.940
 those on the wings 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:00.190
 we do not move forward and we leave 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.590
 we apply these that come from base and 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.369
 about those we are going to apply 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.369
 this is later 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:17.600
 we already cut them in this case was the 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:21.100
 number 33 and 52 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.100
 what does the manual say 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.910
 at home 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:32.989
 52 and 33 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.720
 let's go to these karts you have to 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:38.090
 submerge in water and then put on 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.050
 the position and when they dry they have 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.870
 Adhered to the plastic 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.430
 let's show how it has been custom 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.900
 of our tutorials two ways to 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:52.280
 doing so we're going to position one in water and 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:55.160
 another in vinegar the right hand is 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:58.090
 true water vinegar and in your hand 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.090
 vinegar is left 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:09.030
 because the vinegar has a vinegar 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.650
 compound called acetic acid that 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.310
 is the compound that can also be 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.840
 find in scholarship holders like this 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.160
 that while some tutorials that 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.900
 recommendations speak of occupying the 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.890
 occupy in the vinegar to be able to fix 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.890
 the dry 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.459
 with the help of some tweezers we are going to 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.459
 remove 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.209
 and cecale 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.230
 to verify what is the position 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:59.909
 it has to do 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:03.870
 let's moisten the surface a bit 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:03.870
 where are we going to put it 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.800
 and then let's let it go a little 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.459
 to position it 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.410
 we remove 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.170
 we do not see a little 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.010
 let's continue to be happy with the position 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.010
 I take 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:44.740
 We move slightly moisten the idea 

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:48.330
 surfaces that allow us to move 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.330
 the lime without problem 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.680
 of water 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.949
 not only lower a little more 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.930
 will run into the detail of trample 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.660
 then with 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.660
 an absorbent paper 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:19.840
 over we remove 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.549
 it can have 

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:27.549
 that you have installed 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.860
 a lot of lime 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.860
 to see what happened to 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.800
 with our vinegar mix 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:43.380
 this mixture is faster going to drop 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:45.830
 much faster than you can see 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:49.390
 I already released it here 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.390
 to floating here in the water 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:55.200
 Quick 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:02.290
 we repeat the operation with a little 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.290
 Water 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.950
 we put a bit the surface where the 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.270
 we are going to 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:15.350
 until the 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.350
 we finish with 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:21.800
 the caliper we try to position 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.800
 the 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.630
 so that it fits the shot 

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:40.740
 we compared a little as indicated 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:44.419
 you have to get the 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.419
 and we are not going to move a little bit 

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:54.639
 down 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:00.560
 we remove 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.560
 the excess 

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:08.449
 and this one 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:12.279
 our near ones applied 

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:12.279
 now you just have to let it dry 

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:19.760
 and then apply some 

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:23.720
 some protection so that they do not go to 

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:26.150
 scrape good that would be the tutorial of the 

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:29.030
 today remember to like

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:35.920
 suggestions for the next tutorials 

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:35.920
 it's very good to see you
