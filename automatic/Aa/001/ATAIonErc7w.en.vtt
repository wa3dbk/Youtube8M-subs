right here these wells they've never
these<00:00:34.950> are<00:00:35.160> original<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.880> factory<00:00:36.360> most

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
these are original to the factory most

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.630 
these are original to the factory most
of<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.780> time<00:00:36.960> these<00:00:37.110> ducks<00:00:37.440> rotted<00:00:38.280> right<00:00:38.489> out

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
of the time these ducks rotted right out

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.040 
of the time these ducks rotted right out
and<00:00:38.760> matter<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:38.969> fact<00:00:39.030> they<00:00:39.270> rotted<00:00:39.480> right<00:00:39.840> out

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
and matter of fact they rotted right out

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.290 
and matter of fact they rotted right out
back<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.100> 40s<00:00:41.579> when<00:00:41.790> they<00:00:41.910> were<00:00:42.000> even

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
back in the 40s when they were even

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.880 
back in the 40s when they were even
produced<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:42.840> get<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.020> little<00:00:43.110> saltwater<00:00:43.500> down

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
produced it get a little saltwater down

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.830 
produced it get a little saltwater down
in<00:00:44.070> there<00:00:44.250> we<00:00:44.640> didn't<00:00:44.879> have<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.059> decent<00:00:45.329> rust

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
in there we didn't have a decent rust

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.779 
in there we didn't have a decent rust
proofing<00:00:46.230> they<00:00:46.710> just<00:00:46.890> put<00:00:47.100> red<00:00:47.370> oxide<00:00:47.730> primer

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
proofing they just put red oxide primer

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.369 
proofing they just put red oxide primer
on<00:00:48.270> there<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.480> they<00:00:48.570> called<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:48.989> good<00:00:49.140> well

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
on there and they called it good well

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.930 
on there and they called it good well
these<00:00:49.469> things<00:00:49.649> will<00:00:49.860> rust<00:00:50.100> out<00:00:50.250> instantly

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
these things will rust out instantly

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.389 
these things will rust out instantly
it's<00:00:51.329> just<00:00:51.780> sheet<00:00:52.110> metal<00:00:52.469> untreated<00:00:53.190> sheet

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
it's just sheet metal untreated sheet

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.819 
it's just sheet metal untreated sheet
metal<00:00:53.699> throw<00:00:54.210> them<00:00:54.329> together

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
metal throw them together

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.709 
metal throw them together
this<00:00:55.829> duck<00:00:56.100> never<00:00:56.610> saw<00:00:56.910> service<00:00:57.210> matter<00:00:57.600> of

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
this duck never saw service matter of

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.060 
this duck never saw service matter of
fact<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:57.930> don't<00:00:57.989> even<00:00:58.109> think<00:00:58.289> it's<00:00:58.500> ever<00:00:58.710> left

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
fact I don't even think it's ever left

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.180 
fact I don't even think it's ever left
Michigan<00:00:59.730> has<00:01:00.359> been<00:01:00.390> here<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:00.960> long<00:01:01.010> but<00:01:02.010> it

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
Michigan has been here so long but it

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.130 
Michigan has been here so long but it
still<00:01:02.430> has<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.940> own<00:01:03.149> original<00:01:03.719> information

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
still has the own original information

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.490 
still has the own original information
system<00:01:04.860> on<00:01:05.010> here<00:01:05.250> right<00:01:05.939> here<00:01:06.240> what's<00:01:07.200> really

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
system on here right here what's really

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.899 
system on here right here what's really
cool<00:01:07.650> about<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:08.130> system<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.880> can

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
cool about that system is you can

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.090 
cool about that system is you can
inflate<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.689> deflate<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.110> tires<00:01:10.350> as<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.920> go

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
inflate and deflate the tires as you go

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.590 
inflate and deflate the tires as you go
down<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.490> road<00:01:11.670> there's<00:01:11.970> an<00:01:12.090> onboard

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
down the road there's an onboard

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.420 
down the road there's an onboard
compressor<00:01:13.170> driven<00:01:13.560> off<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.010> front<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.310> the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
compressor driven off the front of the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.840 
compressor driven off the front of the
engine<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.560> driver<00:01:16.560> has<00:01:16.920> six<00:01:17.280> valves

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
engine and the driver has six valves

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.760 
engine and the driver has six valves
that<00:01:18.000> they<00:01:18.150> can<00:01:18.299> go<00:01:18.420> through<00:01:18.659> inflate<00:01:19.530> deflate

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
that they can go through inflate deflate

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.280 
that they can go through inflate deflate
the<00:01:20.159> tires<00:01:20.369> as<00:01:20.640> they're<00:01:21.030> going<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.630> whether

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
the tires as they're going and whether

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.109 
the tires as they're going and whether
you<00:01:22.500> want<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.770> more<00:01:22.950> pressure<00:01:23.250> up<00:01:23.460> front<00:01:23.520> or

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
you want it more pressure up front or

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.640 
you want it more pressure up front or
less<00:01:24.360> pressure<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:25.110> can<00:01:25.229> just<00:01:25.409> turn<00:01:25.590> that

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
less pressure you can just turn that

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.030 
less pressure you can just turn that
right<00:01:26.009> down<00:01:27.080> hoses<00:01:28.080> lines<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.860> everything
