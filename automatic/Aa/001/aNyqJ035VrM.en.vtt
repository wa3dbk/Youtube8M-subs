used the age 21 I had zero kills with it
which<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.450> quite<00:01:27.750> impressive<00:01:28.110> this<00:01:28.590> firing<00:01:28.920> to

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160

battlefield 4 that I have never used the
age<00:01:31.320> 21<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.270> effectively<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.810> just<00:01:34.140> a

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.230 
age 21 and effectively it is just a

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.640 
age 21 and effectively it is just a
cut-down<00:01:34.500> age<00:01:34.980> 23<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.690> age<00:01:36.750> 21<00:01:37.230> has<00:01:37.440> the

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
carbine model so it drops up to 15

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.040 
carbine model so it drops up to 15
damaging<00:01:41.130> sort<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.370> 18<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.240> it's<00:01:42.720> got<00:01:42.900> a

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
damaging sort of 18 and it's got a

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.260 
damaging sort of 18 and it's got a
shorter<00:01:43.590> maximum<00:01:44.190> range<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.730> a<00:01:44.970> slower

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
bullet velocity but what it does have

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.000 
bullet velocity but what it does have
going<00:01:48.180> for<00:01:48.480> it<00:01:48.690> is<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:48.930> has<00:01:49.320> much<00:01:49.740> better

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
going for it is it has much better

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.750 
going for it is it has much better
hipfire<00:01:50.690> to<00:01:51.690> counteract<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.260> the<00:01:52.800> ace<00:01:53.040> 21

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
hipfire to counteract that the ace 21

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.540 
hipfire to counteract that the ace 21
has<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.090> bigger<00:01:54.450> magazine<00:01:55.020> it's<00:01:55.230> got<00:01:55.350> 36<00:01:56.040> in<00:01:56.340> it

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
has a bigger magazine it's got 36 in it

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.810 
has a bigger magazine it's got 36 in it
and<00:01:56.730> it<00:01:57.240> also<00:01:57.480> has<00:01:58.020> much<00:01:58.530> better<00:01:58.830> hipfire<00:01:59.490> and

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
and it also has much better hipfire and

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.660 
and it also has much better hipfire and
it<00:02:00.480> also<00:02:00.660> has<00:02:00.870> better<00:02:01.320> aimed<00:02:01.680> fire<00:02:02.100> if<00:02:02.430> you're

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
it also has better aimed fire if you're

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.420 
it also has better aimed fire if you're
moving<00:02:03.240> so<00:02:04.020> this<00:02:04.500> is<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.740> gun<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:04.980> you<00:02:05.220> use

moving so this is the gun that you use

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.149 
moving so this is the gun that you use
close<00:02:05.790> up<00:02:05.970> on<00:02:06.120> the<00:02:06.240> move<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.930> ace23<00:02:07.290> is<00:02:07.920> the

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:08.159 
close up on the move the ace23 is the

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:10.969 
close up on the move the ace23 is the
gun<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.549> used<00:02:08.579> but<00:02:09.149> longer<00:02:09.629> distances<00:02:10.170> now

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
gun you used but longer distances now

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.530 
gun you used but longer distances now
you<00:02:11.039> would<00:02:11.249> think<00:02:11.280> that<00:02:11.579> a<00:02:11.760> close-range

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
you would think that a close-range

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.200 
you would think that a close-range
version<00:02:13.019> of

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
version of

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.140 
version of
age<00:02:13.360> 23<00:02:13.750> would<00:02:14.500> have<00:02:14.830> a<00:02:14.860> role<00:02:15.160> in<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.370> game<00:02:15.640> but

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
age 23 would have a role in the game but

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.980 
age 23 would have a role in the game but
it<00:02:16.300> really<00:02:16.630> doesn't<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:18.100> ACE<00:02:18.400> 21<00:02:19.240> just<00:02:19.690> can't

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
it really doesn't the ACE 21 just can't

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.010 
it really doesn't the ACE 21 just can't
compete<00:02:20.590> it<00:02:20.890> gets<00:02:21.340> beaten<00:02:21.790> by<00:02:21.910> a<00:02:21.940> lot<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.300> PDW

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
compete it gets beaten by a lot the PDW

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.860 
compete it gets beaten by a lot the PDW
it<00:02:23.620> gets<00:02:23.890> beaten<00:02:24.430> by<00:02:24.550> carbines<00:02:25.060> like<00:02:25.270> the<00:02:25.450> mtar

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
it gets beaten by carbines like the mtar

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.990 
it gets beaten by carbines like the mtar
and<00:02:26.140> it<00:02:26.590> gets<00:02:26.740> beaten<00:02:27.100> by<00:02:27.190> assault<00:02:27.550> rifles

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
and it gets beaten by assault rifles

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.960 
and it gets beaten by assault rifles
like<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.240> AEK<00:02:28.780> it<00:02:29.620> just<00:02:29.890> can't<00:02:30.220> compete<00:02:30.700> as<00:02:30.940> a

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
like the AEK it just can't compete as a

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.530 
like the AEK it just can't compete as a
close-range<00:02:31.750> hit<00:02:32.050> by<00:02:32.260> a<00:02:32.290> gun<00:02:32.790> short<00:02:33.790> it<00:02:34.090> has

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
close-range hit by a gun short it has

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.300 
close-range hit by a gun short it has
got<00:02:34.870> a<00:02:34.900> bit<00:02:35.140> of<00:02:35.260> accuracy<00:02:35.650> when<00:02:35.920> it<00:02:36.010> gets<00:02:36.130> out

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
got a bit of accuracy when it gets out

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.660 
got a bit of accuracy when it gets out
to<00:02:36.370> range<00:02:36.760> but<00:02:37.420> if<00:02:37.570> you<00:02:37.660> compare<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:38.410> age<00:02:38.710> 21

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
to range but if you compare the age 21

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.620 
to range but if you compare the age 21
to<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.270> AK<00:02:40.660> 5<00:02:40.990> see<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:42.070> AK<00:02:42.370> 5c<00:02:42.940> beats<00:02:43.330> it<00:02:43.510> on

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
to the AK 5 see the AK 5c beats it on

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.380 
to the AK 5 see the AK 5c beats it on
almost<00:02:44.050> every<00:02:44.740> stat<00:02:45.070> apart<00:02:45.640> from<00:02:45.820> rate<00:02:46.150> of

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
almost every stat apart from rate of

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.470 
almost every stat apart from rate of
fire<00:02:46.660> so<00:02:47.530> unfortunately<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.220> age<00:02:48.340> 21<00:02:48.820> isn't<00:02:49.390> a

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
fire so unfortunately the age 21 isn't a

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.080 
fire so unfortunately the age 21 isn't a
jack<00:02:49.690> of<00:02:49.720> all<00:02:49.960> trades<00:02:50.410> and<00:02:50.620> it<00:02:50.980> isn't<00:02:51.520> a<00:02:51.610> master

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
jack of all trades and it isn't a master

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.420 
jack of all trades and it isn't a master

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
of what it's supposed to be good at but

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.150 
of what it's supposed to be good at but
it<00:02:54.550> is<00:02:54.700> fun<00:02:55.060> to<00:02:55.210> use<00:02:55.510> it's<00:02:56.440> not<00:02:56.650> so<00:02:56.890> bad<00:02:56.920> that

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
it is fun to use it's not so bad that

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.740 
it is fun to use it's not so bad that
it's<00:02:57.400> going<00:02:57.550> to<00:02:57.610> get<00:02:57.730> you<00:02:57.880> into<00:02:58.030> trouble<00:02:58.330> it's

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
it's going to get you into trouble it's

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.990 
it's going to get you into trouble it's
just<00:02:59.170> not<00:02:59.500> really<00:02:59.980> good<00:03:00.220> enough<00:03:00.250> to<00:03:00.700> get<00:03:00.820> you

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
just not really good enough to get you

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.030 
just not really good enough to get you
out<00:03:01.150> of<00:03:01.180> trouble<00:03:01.740> now<00:03:02.740> you<00:03:02.800> might<00:03:02.950> be

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
out of trouble now you might be

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.880 
out of trouble now you might be
surprised<00:03:03.370> to<00:03:03.550> see<00:03:03.580> me<00:03:03.850> pulling<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.180> m320<00:03:04.890> but

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
surprised to see me pulling the m320 but

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.770 
surprised to see me pulling the m320 but
in<00:03:06.100> these<00:03:06.400> rounds<00:03:06.910> we're<00:03:07.060> supposed<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:07.600> be

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
in these rounds we're supposed to be

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.290 
in these rounds we're supposed to be
playing<00:03:08.050> assault<00:03:08.560> not<00:03:09.220> everybody<00:03:09.760> is<00:03:09.970> playing

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
playing assault not everybody is playing

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.330 
playing assault not everybody is playing
assault<00:03:10.750> but<00:03:11.050> the<00:03:11.080> idea<00:03:11.410> was<00:03:11.470> that<00:03:11.680> people

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
assault but the idea was that people

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.370 
assault but the idea was that people
would<00:03:12.460> plate<00:03:12.700> assault<00:03:13.150> so<00:03:13.570> I<00:03:13.600> have<00:03:13.960> the<00:03:14.140> med

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
would plate assault so I have the med

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.360 
would plate assault so I have the med
bag<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:15.250> m320<00:03:15.850> and<00:03:16.390> the<00:03:17.320> Magnum<00:03:17.770> with<00:03:18.100> the

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
bag the m320 and the Magnum with the

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.060 
bag the m320 and the Magnum with the
three<00:03:18.610> times<00:03:18.880> scope<00:03:19.210> on<00:03:19.450> it<00:03:19.480> so<00:03:20.230> I've<00:03:20.560> got<00:03:20.860> a

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
three times scope on it so I've got a

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.670 
three times scope on it so I've got a
bit<00:03:21.820> of<00:03:21.940> destruction<00:03:22.510> bit<00:03:23.230> of<00:03:23.350> long-range

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
bit of destruction bit of long-range

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.000 
bit of destruction bit of long-range
sniping<00:03:24.370> I've<00:03:25.060> got<00:03:25.360> med<00:03:25.780> bag<00:03:26.020> and<00:03:26.320> I've<00:03:26.830> got

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
sniping I've got med bag and I've got

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.570 
sniping I've got med bag and I've got
the<00:03:27.190> ACE<00:03:27.490> 21<00:03:28.030> as<00:03:28.210> my<00:03:28.870> close<00:03:29.170> range<00:03:29.440> option<00:03:29.680> so<00:03:30.550> I

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
the ACE 21 as my close range option so I

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.580 
the ACE 21 as my close range option so I
thought<00:03:30.820> I<00:03:31.060> got<00:03:31.300> all<00:03:31.510> the<00:03:31.660> bases<00:03:31.780> covered<00:03:32.050> with

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
thought I got all the bases covered with

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.860 
thought I got all the bases covered with
this<00:03:32.770> kinda<00:03:33.190> lowdown<00:03:33.420> later<00:03:34.420> on<00:03:34.690> in<00:03:34.780> the

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
this kinda lowdown later on in the

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.240 
this kinda lowdown later on in the
rounds<00:03:35.140> when<00:03:35.260> I<00:03:35.290> realized<00:03:35.650> we've<00:03:35.830> got<00:03:35.980> a<00:03:36.010> bunch

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
rounds when I realized we've got a bunch

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.890 
rounds when I realized we've got a bunch
of<00:03:36.370> Engineers<00:03:36.550> and<00:03:36.910> support<00:03:37.420> players<00:03:37.630> on<00:03:37.870> our

of Engineers and support players on our

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.580 
of Engineers and support players on our
team<00:03:38.050> I<00:03:38.530> drop<00:03:39.460> the<00:03:39.580> m320<00:03:40.180> and<00:03:40.720> went<00:03:41.320> back<00:03:41.560> to

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.460 
being a proper medic with defects but I
quite<00:03:45.040> enjoyed<00:03:45.430> my<00:03:45.670> utility<00:03:46.240> lowdown<00:03:46.630> I'm<00:03:47.170> not
