alright<00:00:12.389> today<00:00:12.540> we're<00:00:12.630> looking<00:00:12.719> at<00:00:12.840> the

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
alright today we're looking at the

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.369 
alright today we're looking at the
geforce<00:00:13.349> 9500<00:00:13.980> GT<00:00:14.340> from<00:00:15.299> nvidia<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.289> the

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
geforce 9500 GT from nvidia this is the

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.800 
geforce 9500 GT from nvidia this is the
EVGA<00:00:16.710> version<00:00:17.279> now<00:00:17.640> I've<00:00:17.730> done<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.150> the

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
EVGA version now I've done the the

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.929 
EVGA version now I've done the the
review<00:00:19.410> on<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.650> 512<00:00:20.310> megabyte<00:00:20.640> version<00:00:20.850> but

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
review on the 512 megabyte version but

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.700 
review on the 512 megabyte version but
this<00:00:21.090> is<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.300> bigger<00:00:21.630> frame<00:00:22.050> buffer<00:00:22.410> so<00:00:22.560> it's

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
this is the bigger frame buffer so it's

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.590 
this is the bigger frame buffer so it's
one<00:00:23.010> gigabyte<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.550> ddr2<00:00:23.820> memory<00:00:23.910> going<00:00:24.539> to

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
one gigabyte of ddr2 memory going to

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.779 
one gigabyte of ddr2 memory going to
give<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.810> little<00:00:25.109> bit<00:00:25.230> better<00:00:25.609> frame<00:00:26.609> rates

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
give you a little bit better frame rates

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.660 
give you a little bit better frame rates
for<00:00:27.119> larger<00:00:27.750> screens<00:00:28.289> so<00:00:28.650> if<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.310> don't<00:00:29.550> need

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
for larger screens so if you don't need

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.740 
for larger screens so if you don't need
a<00:00:29.699> lot<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.849> power<00:00:30.090> maybe<00:00:30.359> you're<00:00:30.480> just<00:00:30.539> playing

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
a lot of power maybe you're just playing

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.820 
a lot of power maybe you're just playing
like<00:00:30.900> World<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.199> Warcraft<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.679> you're

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
like World of Warcraft and you're

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.049 
like World of Warcraft and you're
already<00:00:31.920> getting<00:00:32.070> acceptable<00:00:32.640> frame<00:00:32.850> rate

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
already getting acceptable frame rate

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.490 
already getting acceptable frame rate
but<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.239> just<00:00:33.360> created<00:00:33.840> your<00:00:33.989> monitor<00:00:34.380> and

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
but you just created your monitor and

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.620 
but you just created your monitor and
it's<00:00:35.309> just<00:00:35.579> falling<00:00:35.820> off<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.059> little<00:00:36.300> bit<00:00:36.480> this

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
it's just falling off a little bit this

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.610 
it's just falling off a little bit this
is<00:00:36.690> going<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:36.989> give<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.320> it's<00:00:37.410> going<00:00:37.530> to

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
is going to give you it's going to

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.780 
is going to give you it's going to
prevent<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:37.980> fall<00:00:38.160> off<00:00:38.280> basic<00:00:38.520> was<00:00:38.610> going<00:00:38.730> to

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
prevent that fall off basic was going to

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.819 
prevent that fall off basic was going to
happen<00:00:39.030> as<00:00:39.180> your<00:00:39.540> resolution<00:00:40.020> increases<00:00:40.170> your

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
happen as your resolution increases your

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.410 
happen as your resolution increases your
frame<00:00:41.100> rate<00:00:41.129> goes<00:00:41.430> down<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:42.300> is

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
frame rate goes down and this is

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.340 
frame rate goes down and this is
basically<00:00:42.719> going<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.960> make<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.200> little

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
basically going to make that little

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.569 
basically going to make that little
downward<00:00:43.649> arc<00:00:44.010> it's<00:00:44.190> going<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.370> make<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.550> a

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
downward arc it's going to make it a

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.209 
downward arc it's going to make it a
little<00:00:44.820> less<00:00:45.090> steep<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.140> can<00:00:46.289> keep<00:00:47.100> your

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
little less steep so you can keep your

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.760 
little less steep so you can keep your
performance<00:00:47.670> at<00:00:47.789> certain<00:00:48.120> resolutions<00:00:48.600> now

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
performance at certain resolutions now

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.260 
performance at certain resolutions now
basically<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.820> type<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.000> car<00:00:51.239> that

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
basically this is the type of car that

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.790 
basically this is the type of car that
you<00:00:51.420> want<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.690> buy<00:00:51.780> if<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.379> want<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.620> do<00:00:52.680> some

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
you want to buy if you want to do some

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.990 
you want to buy if you want to do some
home<00:00:52.920> theater<00:00:53.280> stuff<00:00:53.340> if<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.760> want<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:53.940> be

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
home theater stuff if you want to be

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.639 
home theater stuff if you want to be
able<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.180> do<00:00:54.270> HD<00:00:54.629> video<00:00:54.899> if<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.469> need<00:00:55.500> a

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
able to do HD video if you need a

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.319 
able to do HD video if you need a
general-purpose<00:00:56.129> video<00:00:56.670> card<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.000> don't

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
general-purpose video card you don't

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.090 
general-purpose video card you don't
really<00:00:57.480> know<00:00:57.660> what<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.870> buy<00:00:58.020> this<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.800> really

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
really know what to buy this is a really

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.410 
really know what to buy this is a really
good<00:00:59.219> card<00:00:59.430> for<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.609> it's<00:00:59.760> very<00:00:59.940> affordable

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
good card for that it's very affordable

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.000 
good card for that it's very affordable
it's<00:01:00.750> very<00:01:00.930> power<00:01:01.260> efficient<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.710> doesn't

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
it's very power efficient it doesn't

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.529 
it's very power efficient it doesn't
produce<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.250> lot<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.460> heat<00:01:02.609> it's<00:01:02.969> pci<00:01:03.329> express

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
produce a lot of heat it's pci express

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.119 
produce a lot of heat it's pci express
2.0<00:01:03.719> so<00:01:04.229> if<00:01:04.320> it's<00:01:04.470> in<00:01:04.559> most<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.920> newer

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
2.0 so if it's in most of the newer

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.969 
2.0 so if it's in most of the newer
computers<00:01:05.519> it's<00:01:06.150> got<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.479> VGA<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:07.260> DVI<00:01:07.530> input

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
computers it's got a VGA and a DVI input

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.560 
computers it's got a VGA and a DVI input
but<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.640> powerful<00:01:09.000> enough<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.180> plate<00:01:09.390> just

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
but it is powerful enough to plate just

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.660 
but it is powerful enough to plate just
about<00:01:09.750> any<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.010> kind<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.220> like<00:01:11.340> older

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
about any of the kind of like older

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.160 
about any of the kind of like older
games<00:01:11.850> like<00:01:12.030> all<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.240> half-life<00:01:12.600> 2<00:01:12.780> engine

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
games like all the half-life 2 engine

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.200 
games like all the half-life 2 engine
games<00:01:13.409> World<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.100> Warcraft<00:01:14.460> games<00:01:14.670> etc<00:01:14.850> etc

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
games World of Warcraft games etc etc

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.690 
games World of Warcraft games etc etc
and<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.170> course<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.470> has<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.710> pure<00:01:16.979> HD<00:01:17.340> video

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
and of course it has the pure HD video

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.210 
and of course it has the pure HD video
from<00:01:18.030> Nvidia<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.659> will<00:01:18.780> do<00:01:18.960> full<00:01:19.229> 1080p<00:01:19.590> no

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
from Nvidia so it will do full 1080p no

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.890 
from Nvidia so it will do full 1080p no
problem<00:01:20.610> including<00:01:20.729> like<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.150> put<00:01:21.570> like<00:01:21.659> four
