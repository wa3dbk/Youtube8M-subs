00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.980 
it doesn't really make a hole in it it's
no<00:02:05.430> more<00:02:05.670> than<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:05.909> hole<00:02:06.149> from<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.600> sewing

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.830 
no more than a hole from a sewing
machine<00:02:07.439> but<00:02:08.190> before<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.640> stapled<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.690> the

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
machine but before I stapled it to the

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.699 
machine but before I stapled it to the
shirt<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.649> give<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.520> one

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
shirt I give it one

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:22.369 
shirt I give it one
staple<00:02:13.709> together<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:21.750> hold<00:02:21.930> that<00:02:22.140> piece

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
staple together to hold that piece

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:29.210 
staple together to hold that piece
together<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:23.159> then<00:02:27.709> sometimes<00:02:28.709> you<00:02:28.920> have<00:02:29.069> to

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
together and then sometimes you have to

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:37.250 
together and then sometimes you have to
redo<00:02:31.549> stretch<00:02:32.549> it<00:02:32.700> out<00:02:32.790> a<00:02:32.849> little<00:02:33.090> bit<00:02:36.260> yeah

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
redo stretch it out a little bit yeah

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.369 
redo stretch it out a little bit yeah
that's<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.650> hard<00:02:37.739> part<00:02:37.860> about<00:02:38.129> stapling<00:02:38.849> it

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
that's the hard part about stapling it

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:48.530 
that's the hard part about stapling it
to<00:02:40.379> redoing<00:02:40.799> it<00:02:45.530> now<00:02:46.530> if<00:02:46.890> it's<00:02:47.250> easier<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:48.390> can

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
to redoing it now if it's easier you can

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.920 
to redoing it now if it's easier you can
use<00:02:48.780> tape<00:02:50.030> all<00:02:51.030> right<00:02:51.090> so<00:02:51.389> what<00:02:51.599> I'm<00:02:51.720> going<00:02:51.870> to

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
use tape all right so what I'm going to

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:58.309 
use tape all right so what I'm going to
do<00:02:52.079> now<00:02:52.319> is<00:02:53.989> put<00:02:54.989> on<00:02:55.170> some<00:02:55.819> insignia<00:02:57.230> now<00:02:58.230> the

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
do now is put on some insignia now the

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.390 
do now is put on some insignia now the
trick<00:02:58.950> about<00:02:59.069> this<00:02:59.250> is<00:02:59.819> the<00:03:00.389> knot<00:03:01.159> the<00:03:02.159> Rope

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
trick about this is the knot the Rope

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.899 
trick about this is the knot the Rope
has<00:03:02.639> to<00:03:02.670> go<00:03:02.940> over<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:04.230> top<00:03:04.500> of<00:03:04.530> it<00:03:04.889> and<00:03:05.069> when

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:05.909 
has to go over the top of it and when

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:07.610 
has to go over the top of it and when
you're<00:03:06.030> wearing<00:03:06.269> it<00:03:06.510> this<00:03:06.780> goes<00:03:07.049> to<00:03:07.440> the

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
you're wearing it this goes to the

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.430 
you're wearing it this goes to the
center<00:03:08.060> so<00:03:09.060> this<00:03:09.180> is<00:03:09.359> the<00:03:09.569> the<00:03:10.220> Nisa<00:03:12.260> Eagle<00:03:13.260> not

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
center so this is the the Nisa Eagle not

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.640 
center so this is the the Nisa Eagle not
with<00:03:13.829> the<00:03:14.540> silver<00:03:15.540> rim<00:03:15.780> around<00:03:15.930> it<00:03:16.319> you<00:03:16.500> have

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
with the silver rim around it you have

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.369 
with the silver rim around it you have
to<00:03:16.769> be<00:03:16.889> a<00:03:16.919> lifetime<00:03:17.250> member<00:03:17.940> of<00:03:17.970> Nisa<00:03:18.299> to<00:03:19.199> have

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 
to be a lifetime member of Nisa to have

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:23.150 
to be a lifetime member of Nisa to have
this<00:03:19.590> not<00:03:20.329> the<00:03:21.329> regular<00:03:21.720> adult<00:03:21.989> not<00:03:22.349> has<00:03:23.129> a

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
this not the regular adult not has a

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.819 
this not the regular adult not has a
regular<00:03:23.609> border<00:03:24.239> around<00:03:24.329> it<00:03:24.690> and<00:03:25.470> this<00:03:25.620> is<00:03:25.799> the

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
regular border around it and this is the

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.539 
regular border around it and this is the
we<00:03:26.099> blows<00:03:26.430> adult<00:03:27.090> knot<00:03:27.569> and<00:03:28.129> you<00:03:29.129> see<00:03:29.340> it's

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
we blows adult knot and you see it's

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.229 
we blows adult knot and you see it's
over<00:03:29.849> and<00:03:30.949> this<00:03:31.949> is<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.160> training<00:03:32.549> knot<00:03:32.879> and

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
over and this is a training knot and

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.780 
over and this is a training knot and
this<00:03:33.930> one<00:03:34.079> is<00:03:34.199> kind<00:03:34.410> of<00:03:34.470> hard<00:03:34.650> to<00:03:34.709> tell<00:03:34.980> but<00:03:35.280> you

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
this one is kind of hard to tell but you

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.409 
this one is kind of hard to tell but you
can<00:03:35.940> see<00:03:36.150> that<00:03:36.299> the<00:03:36.419> knot<00:03:36.599> is<00:03:36.870> over<00:03:37.290> there<00:03:38.419> so

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:39.419 
can see that the knot is over there so

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:42.080 
can see that the knot is over there so
the<00:03:39.569> first<00:03:39.810> thing<00:03:39.989> I<00:03:40.079> was<00:03:40.549> going<00:03:41.549> to<00:03:41.699> try<00:03:41.910> on

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
the first thing I was going to try on

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.309 
the first thing I was going to try on
this<00:03:42.739> some<00:03:43.739> of<00:03:43.769> this<00:03:43.919> is<00:03:44.099> experiments<00:03:45.169> tape<00:03:46.169> it

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
this some of this is experiments tape it

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:52.129 
this some of this is experiments tape it
together<00:03:49.910> so<00:03:50.910> they're<00:03:51.090> butting<00:03:51.480> up<00:03:51.599> together

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
together so they're butting up together

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:55.939 
together so they're butting up together
and<00:03:53.239> then<00:03:54.239> we're<00:03:54.690> going<00:03:54.870> to<00:03:54.989> staple<00:03:55.470> it<00:03:55.739> to<00:03:55.919> the

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:55.949 
and then we're going to staple it to the

00:03:55.949 --> 00:04:02.349 
and then we're going to staple it to the
shirt<00:03:58.280> this<00:03:59.280> also<00:03:59.849> takes<00:04:00.120> a<00:04:00.269> little<00:04:00.419> bit<00:04:00.629> of

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:02.359 
shirt this also takes a little bit of

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:08.040 
shirt this also takes a little bit of
tedious

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.380 

you<00:04:09.050> have<00:04:09.200> to<00:04:09.320> crimp<00:04:09.710> the<00:04:09.770> shirt<00:04:10.070> up<00:04:10.340> to<00:04:11.150> try<00:04:11.360> to

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
you have to crimp the shirt up to try to

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:29.370 
you have to crimp the shirt up to try to
get<00:04:11.660> it<00:04:11.810> where<00:04:12.800> you<00:04:12.830> need<00:04:13.190> it

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.210 

oh<00:04:31.500> my<00:04:32.500> gosh

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
oh my gosh

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.400 
oh my gosh
okay<00:04:33.730> that<00:04:35.190> that<00:04:36.190> just<00:04:36.870> hurt<00:04:37.870> that<00:04:38.050> a<00:04:38.080> little

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
okay that that just hurt that a little

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.470 
okay that that just hurt that a little
bit<00:04:38.530> but<00:04:38.770> now<00:04:39.010> I'm<00:04:39.250> fine<00:04:39.520> okay

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
bit but now I'm fine okay

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.690 
bit but now I'm fine okay
so<00:04:41.700> it<00:04:42.700> looks<00:04:42.910> a<00:04:43.030> little<00:04:43.240> bit<00:04:44.700> off-center

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
so it looks a little bit off-center

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.170 
so it looks a little bit off-center
whether<00:04:46.480> I'm<00:04:46.690> a<00:04:46.810> perfectionist<00:04:47.170> or<00:04:47.740> not<00:04:48.180> so

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
whether I'm a perfectionist or not so

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.800 
whether I'm a perfectionist or not so
this<00:04:49.510> one<00:04:49.660> I'm<00:04:49.780> going<00:04:49.900> to<00:04:49.990> redo<00:04:51.450> to<00:04:52.450> take<00:04:52.660> it

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
this one I'm going to redo to take it

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.860 
this one I'm going to redo to take it
off<00:04:52.960> you<00:04:53.170> just<00:04:53.200> slide<00:04:53.890> that<00:04:54.300> staple<00:04:55.300> back<00:04:55.660> and

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
off you just slide that staple back and

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.200 
off you just slide that staple back and
forth<00:04:56.170> so<00:04:57.040> it<00:04:57.160> doesn't<00:04:57.460> turn<00:04:57.640> Tara<00:04:58.030> the

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
forth so it doesn't turn Tara the

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.320 
forth so it doesn't turn Tara the
material<00:05:00.120> lift<00:05:01.120> it<00:05:01.330> up

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
material lift it up

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:09.750 
material lift it up
see<00:05:04.330> why<00:05:04.480> I<00:05:04.510> don't<00:05:04.750> want<00:05:04.930> to<00:05:05.050> do<00:05:05.200> these<00:05:08.760> get

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
see why I don't want to do these get

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:22.980 
see why I don't want to do these get
them<00:05:09.880> done<00:05:10.120> and<00:05:10.770> forget<00:05:11.770> about<00:05:11.800> them

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:31.559 

these<00:05:23.590> are<00:05:28.470> a-ok<00:05:29.470> so<00:05:30.430> that's<00:05:30.639> pretty<00:05:30.910> pretty

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:31.569 
these are a-ok so that's pretty pretty

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:35.580 
these are a-ok so that's pretty pretty
well<00:05:31.870> now<00:05:32.759> you<00:05:33.759> can<00:05:33.910> leave<00:05:34.060> the<00:05:34.180> tape<00:05:34.389> on<00:05:34.630> when

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
well now you can leave the tape on when

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.010 
well now you can leave the tape on when
you<00:05:35.680> sew<00:05:35.949> across<00:05:36.190> it<00:05:36.699> it<00:05:37.150> will<00:05:37.360> make<00:05:37.509> holes<00:05:37.810> in

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
you sew across it it will make holes in

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.309 
you sew across it it will make holes in
the<00:05:38.110> tape<00:05:39.120> then<00:05:40.120> you<00:05:40.479> can<00:05:40.599> just<00:05:40.750> pull<00:05:40.960> the<00:05:41.110> tape

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:41.319 
the tape then you can just pull the tape

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:43.200 
the tape then you can just pull the tape
off<00:05:41.349> you<00:05:42.039> might<00:05:42.190> have<00:05:42.400> to<00:05:42.520> pick<00:05:42.669> a<00:05:42.729> little<00:05:42.940> bit

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
off you might have to pick a little bit

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.240 
off you might have to pick a little bit
at<00:05:43.449> the<00:05:43.900> little<00:05:44.169> pieces<00:05:44.349> that<00:05:44.530> are<00:05:44.770> under<00:05:45.099> your

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
at the little pieces that are under your

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.189 
at the little pieces that are under your
threading

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 
threading

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:49.309 
threading
okay<00:05:47.199> so<00:05:47.259> then<00:05:47.620> we<00:05:47.800> have<00:05:48.009> the<00:05:48.250> other<00:05:48.460> one<00:05:48.610> that

00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:49.319 
okay so then we have the other one that

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:56.570 
okay so then we have the other one that
this<00:05:50.319> is<00:05:50.530> the<00:05:50.830> world<00:05:51.840> scouting<00:05:53.130> crest<00:05:54.130> and

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
this is the world scouting crest and

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.249 
this is the world scouting crest and
what<00:05:57.580> I<00:05:57.610> was<00:05:57.849> always<00:05:58.000> told<00:05:58.270> is<00:05:58.479> that<00:05:58.660> it<00:05:58.780> is<00:05:58.930> not

00:05:59.249 --> 00:05:59.259 
what I was always told is that it is not

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:03.810 
what I was always told is that it is not
mandatory<00:06:00.099> to<00:06:00.669> wear<00:06:01.889> but<00:06:02.889> it<00:06:03.310> is<00:06:03.490> very<00:06:03.699> good

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:03.820 
mandatory to wear but it is very good

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.749 
mandatory to wear but it is very good
idea<00:06:04.590> now<00:06:05.590> this<00:06:05.770> is<00:06:05.949> one<00:06:06.190> of<00:06:06.220> the<00:06:06.400> ones<00:06:06.639> that

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:06.759 
idea now this is one of the ones that

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:11.820 
idea now this is one of the ones that

was only available for 2010 but scout

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.749 
was only available for 2010 but scout

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:21.600 
get them they're going to sell out and
they'll<00:06:18.370> never<00:06:18.520> have<00:06:18.669> them<00:06:18.940> again<00:06:20.039> so<00:06:21.039> here<00:06:21.430> we

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610 
they'll never have them again so here we

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.920 
they'll never have them again so here we
have<00:06:21.849> it's<00:06:22.270> a<00:06:22.569> difficult<00:06:23.169> one<00:06:23.440> as<00:06:23.650> well<00:06:24.930> don't

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:25.930 
have it's a difficult one as well don't

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.749 
have it's a difficult one as well don't
want<00:06:26.080> to<00:06:26.139> put<00:06:26.289> tape<00:06:26.500> on<00:06:26.650> the<00:06:26.770> back<00:06:27.039> because<00:06:27.370> if

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:27.759 
want to put tape on the back because if

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:29.129 
want to put tape on the back because if
you<00:06:27.789> sew<00:06:28.030> it<00:06:28.180> down<00:06:28.240> you<00:06:28.570> can<00:06:28.599> will<00:06:28.780> never<00:06:28.960> get

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:29.139 
you sew it down you can will never get

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:34.560 
you sew it down you can will never get
the<00:06:29.229> tape<00:06:29.440> off<00:06:31.020> so<00:06:32.020> what<00:06:32.320> I've<00:06:32.500> done<00:06:32.860> is<00:06:33.449> try<00:06:34.449> to

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:34.570 
the tape off so what I've done is try to

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:42.330 
the tape off so what I've done is try to
staple<00:06:35.470> it<00:06:35.590> inside<00:06:40.229> and<00:06:41.229> this<00:06:41.949> will<00:06:42.130> take<00:06:42.280> a

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:42.340 
staple it inside and this will take a

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:49.080 
staple it inside and this will take a
staple<00:06:42.909> to<00:06:43.150> the<00:06:43.300> side<00:06:43.630> of<00:06:43.870> it<00:06:47.699> when<00:06:48.699> you<00:06:48.820> sew

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:49.090 
staple to the side of it when you sew

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:53.010 
staple to the side of it when you sew
this<00:06:49.360> one<00:06:49.630> on<00:06:50.550> you'll<00:06:51.550> have<00:06:51.789> to<00:06:51.940> sew<00:06:52.180> through

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:53.020 
this one on you'll have to sew through

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:58.469 
this one on you'll have to sew through
two<00:06:53.229> different<00:06:54.599> circles<00:06:56.909> now<00:06:57.909> leave<00:06:58.180> enough

00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:58.479 
two different circles now leave enough

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:02.550 
two different circles now leave enough
room<00:06:58.599> to<00:07:00.120> go<00:07:01.120> up<00:07:01.330> a<00:07:01.509> couple<00:07:01.780> more<00:07:02.110> rows<00:07:02.289> of

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:02.560 
room to go up a couple more rows of

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:10.740 
room to go up a couple more rows of
knots<00:07:04.409> to<00:07:05.409> expand<00:07:06.599> so<00:07:08.729> that's<00:07:09.729> about<00:07:10.479> the

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:10.750 
knots to expand so that's about the

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:17.270 
knots to expand so that's about the
placement<00:07:11.020> for<00:07:11.409> that<00:07:11.650> and

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.820 

put<00:07:18.280> one<00:07:18.540> knot<00:07:19.540> there<00:07:19.870> this<00:07:20.110> is<00:07:20.290> just<00:07:20.440> enough

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:20.830 
put one knot there this is just enough

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.790 
put one knot there this is just enough
to<00:07:21.010> keep<00:07:21.220> it<00:07:21.400> in<00:07:21.550> place<00:07:22.200> while<00:07:23.200> you<00:07:23.260> get<00:07:23.590> it<00:07:23.680> on

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:23.800 
to keep it in place while you get it on

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.090 
to keep it in place while you get it on
the<00:07:23.890> sewing<00:07:24.130> machine<00:07:24.580> and<00:07:25.530> orden<00:07:26.530> hand<00:07:26.770> stitch

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:27.100 
the sewing machine and orden hand stitch

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:32.370 
the sewing machine and orden hand stitch
it<00:07:27.130> and<00:07:28.590> reposition<00:07:29.590> it<00:07:29.740> as<00:07:29.920> you<00:07:30.100> go
