00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.840 
left a bit more of my hair at the front
just<00:04:23.630> so<00:04:23.900> it<00:04:24.080> looks<00:04:24.290> a<00:04:24.410> bit<00:04:24.590> more<00:04:24.830> natural<00:04:25.370> also

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
just so it looks a bit more natural also

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.820 
just so it looks a bit more natural also
as<00:04:26.000> I<00:04:26.150> said<00:04:26.180> it<00:04:26.479> is<00:04:26.570> three<00:04:26.840> bundles<00:04:27.050> of<00:04:27.320> 24

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
as I said it is three bundles of 24

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.560 
as I said it is three bundles of 24
inches<00:04:28.370> and<00:04:28.610> it<00:04:29.240> hits<00:04:29.510> me<00:04:30.550> probably<00:04:31.550> at<00:04:31.790> my

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
inches and it hits me probably at my

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.140 
inches and it hits me probably at my
waist<00:04:33.139> almost<00:04:33.860> but<00:04:34.100> it<00:04:34.310> does<00:04:34.550> get<00:04:34.760> a<00:04:34.820> little

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
waist almost but it does get a little

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.050 
waist almost but it does get a little
thinner<00:04:35.630> at<00:04:35.960> the<00:04:36.500> ends<00:04:37.070> so<00:04:37.460> yeah<00:04:37.669> that's<00:04:37.880> all

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
thinner at the ends so yeah that's all

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.939 
thinner at the ends so yeah that's all
I've<00:04:38.240> got<00:04:38.270> to<00:04:38.449> say<00:04:38.600> about<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:39.199> hair<00:04:39.470> now<00:04:39.710> if
