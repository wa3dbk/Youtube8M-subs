yeah here's that trick that's talking
about<00:02:11.820> take<00:02:12.820> your<00:02:12.970> 17<00:02:13.360> millimeter<00:02:13.780> socket<00:02:14.230> you

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
about take your 17 millimeter socket you

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.300 
about take your 17 millimeter socket you
get<00:02:14.440> your<00:02:15.000> side<00:02:16.000> plugging<00:02:16.390> out<00:02:17.070> you<00:02:18.070> won't<00:02:18.160> be

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
get your side plugging out you won't be

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.340 
get your side plugging out you won't be
turning<00:02:18.520> this<00:02:18.700> counterclockwise<00:02:19.660> toward<00:02:20.290> the

1000 s on the intake flash so I got

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.840 
1000 s on the intake flash so I got
three<00:03:15.910> 1000<00:03:16.450> in<00:03:16.750> the<00:03:16.810> middle<00:03:17.520> you<00:03:18.520> just<00:03:18.700> want

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
three 1000 in the middle you just want

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.500 
three 1000 in the middle you just want
to<00:03:18.940> slide<00:03:19.750> it<00:03:19.900> in<00:03:19.959> between<00:03:20.020> the<00:03:20.290> valve<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:22.120> the

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
to slide it in between the valve and the

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.040 
to slide it in between the valve and the
adjuster<00:03:23.470> and<00:03:24.510> you<00:03:25.510> should<00:03:25.690> have<00:03:25.810> a<00:03:25.840> little

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
adjuster and you should have a little

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.150 
adjuster and you should have a little
just<00:03:26.650> a<00:03:26.739> little<00:03:27.040> bit<00:03:27.190> of<00:03:27.310> resistance<00:03:27.700> this<00:03:28.209> I

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
just a little bit of resistance this I

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.130 
just a little bit of resistance this I
mean<00:03:30.160> there's<00:03:30.370> virtually<00:03:31.090> no<00:03:31.450> resistance<00:03:31.989> on

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
mean there's virtually no resistance on

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.360 
mean there's virtually no resistance on
you<00:03:32.290> type<00:03:32.470> it<00:03:32.650> up<00:03:34.860> so<00:03:35.860> I'll<00:03:35.920> grab<00:03:36.010> my<00:03:36.100> 10

right there and then screw that deal in

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.280 
right there and then screw that deal in
they<00:03:48.670> make<00:03:48.820> a<00:03:48.850> tool<00:03:49.150> for<00:03:49.420> it<00:03:49.510> I've<00:03:49.900> never<00:03:50.110> had

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
they make a tool for it I've never had

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.650 
they make a tool for it I've never had
one<00:03:50.440> I<00:03:50.680> just<00:03:51.400> twist<00:03:51.790> it<00:03:51.880> in<00:03:52.030> with<00:03:52.150> my<00:03:52.270> fingers

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
one I just twist it in with my fingers

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.550 
one I just twist it in with my fingers
until<00:03:53.050> I<00:03:53.140> get<00:03:53.290> it<00:03:53.380> right

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
until I get it right

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.300 
until I get it right
it<00:03:53.770> takes<00:03:54.070> a<00:03:54.160> little<00:03:54.280> longer<00:03:54.489> but<00:03:54.790> it's<00:03:55.180> free

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
it takes a little longer but it's free

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.260 
it takes a little longer but it's free
so<00:03:57.310> I'll<00:03:57.790> get<00:03:57.970> my<00:03:58.000> wrench<00:03:58.270> loosen<00:03:59.050> that<00:03:59.320> up

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
so I'll get my wrench loosen that up

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.330 
so I'll get my wrench loosen that up
then<00:04:01.270> try<00:04:01.900> said<00:04:02.140> two<00:04:02.320> three<00:04:02.530> one<00:04:02.650> thousand

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
then try said two three one thousand

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.330 
then try said two three one thousand
all<00:04:03.670> right<00:04:03.880> we've<00:04:04.030> got<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:04.330> intake<00:04:04.630> set<00:04:05.340> I've

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
all right we've got the intake set I've

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.420 
all right we've got the intake set I've
got<00:04:06.520> it<00:04:06.610> where<00:04:06.700> three<00:04:07.000> of<00:04:07.030> this<00:04:07.270> slide<00:04:07.600> in<00:04:08.430> and

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
got it where three of this slide in and

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.680 
got it where three of this slide in and
a<00:04:09.550> five<00:04:09.820> is<00:04:09.940> kind<00:04:10.150> of<00:04:10.180> tight<00:04:10.420> so

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
a five is kind of tight so

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.080 
a five is kind of tight so
it's<00:04:12.230> probably<00:04:12.620> right<00:04:12.740> around<00:04:12.860> 4<00:04:13.340> 1000<00:04:13.940> which

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
it's probably right around 4 1000 which

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.060 
it's probably right around 4 1000 which
is<00:04:14.120> on<00:04:14.450> the<00:04:14.570> big<00:04:14.720> end<00:04:14.750> which<00:04:15.470> makes<00:04:15.740> me<00:04:15.890> feel

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
is on the big end which makes me feel

is on the big end which makes me feel
safer<00:04:16.520> so<00:04:16.959> said<00:04:17.959> it<00:04:18.050> where<00:04:18.170> you<00:04:18.350> want<00:04:19.959> I'm
