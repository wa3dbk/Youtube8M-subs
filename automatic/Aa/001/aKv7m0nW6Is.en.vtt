00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 the hourglass also watches luxury 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.080
 most prestigious brands in corte pancaldo 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.120
 hundred Verona is also difficult to 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.769
 comment because anyway in the first one 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.110
 time you had an incredible series 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.480
 of failed occasions came down the 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.880
 Sampdoria and just said also 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.380
 the mister who is a passive who is not there 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.720
 there was not all this difference 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:28.560
 ethical as the comments below this 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:31.109
 this game is easy to detour 50 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.550
 so a bit heavy and maybe like 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.630
 surely your sinisa has had 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:41.610
 there are so many opportunities here instead of 22 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:44.070
 and at 38 they were already 30 mental clean 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:48.030
 we paid strong then she came 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.500
 out of sum second time so must 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.789
 get to the bottom of the game towards each 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.460
 once they came, he made a goal 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.770
 in general not a good match too 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.540
 self 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.010
 more that quarter of an hour there could be 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.500
 get back on our feet we would also have 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.920
 deserved to do it however in general not 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.230
 a good game when even if not 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.570
 score goals you suffer so much and I talk 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.910
 always team when you defend yourself not 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.590
 good team 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.020
 matches take these turns now 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.200
 it's up to us at the moment we do 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.610
 result we don't score goals a 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.200
 even major teams happen 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.520
 in short, the premiums of the series 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:33.640
 negative now our moment e 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:35.720
 it's up to us to get out of it mister but he has 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.420
 impressed that you also on 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.920
 5 to 0 you never gave up in the sense 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.110
 that there was pressing there was will 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.970
 even if the game was already lost is 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.750
 fruit of a mentality that wants 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.729
 this but she feeds them wide 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.830
 mentality there was an open result 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:57.259
 but so it was maybe there was in the spaces 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.929
 because they are now 5 to 0 you could 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.459
 leave some restart the mentality 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:03.950
 his this team has she had it 

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:07.069
 also see in the preparation of 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.310
 this race though even if you build 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:12.740
 then you suffer so much in a short time yes 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.490
 he also looked at the first scores at 58 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.920
 58 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.720
 I was wrong then 50 so too 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.760
 even less than an hour 5 goals to one 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.410
 team like our creed that we must 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.720
 ask the questions then in general 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.910
 when you don't defend yourself well as a team 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.160
 me but I am happy then to have 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.160
 all mentalities all mentality 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.349
 offensive you want but I don't think it is 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.990
 the right mentality has led us to do 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:38.780
 many points maybe not having one 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:41.840
 great solidity but always being 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.230
 team now at least today has not been 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.230
 so-called 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.520
 he rightly said he let himself be made of 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.110
 you always ask yourself each and every end 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.560
 match and the tendency of the last ones 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.420
 four games is unfortunately 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.780
 statistically negative what are the 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.580
 the first questions that you do now Product 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.860
 primates anticipated than in series with us 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.180
 they are sequences that touch many 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.820
 teams in the up to turin came from 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.170
 four defeats then won the 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.110
 Fiorentina at seven games won one 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.520
 time like us then also teams the 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.290
 torino more or less like ours by 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.770
 of the highest Florentine so there are 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.380
 moments 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.210
 now is our time when 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.630
 we must get out of it 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:32.710
 we are suffering because we do not score goals 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.660
 we suffer and it did n't happen before maybe 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.390
 it happens we happen to be staff there 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.890
 happening now is thanks to what 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.040
 they made the kids all together 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.500
 it happens to us 40 points however this doesn't want 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.400
 to say nothing we must find some 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.480
 answers I for one with boys 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.790
 and therefore the first since tonight 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.660
 proposal maybe it's always like that though 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:58.570
 Wednesday we already have a race like that 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.970
 revenge and therefore the tonnage was already 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.800
 let's withdrawal I think it's the right thing 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.540
 if a company then the team tonight 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.670
 of the Verona return and is in retreat 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:11.890
 best prepare the match with 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:13.810
 desire to first referred to the 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.180
 connect that you said something to a 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:20.020
 end game nicely you and 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.330
 mihajlovic asks the coach that you quote e 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:24.250
 tell us what you said to each other 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.310
 I said fuck you like it every time 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.250
 games with us make 4 5 goals not always 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.650
 party like that 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.400
 the first then ends no at all 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:37.250
 nice ironic even in the pre-race 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.430
 congratulations to him I believe we have 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.700
 given also a hand it is also good that up 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.920
 this is this 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.780
 union of intent between the two companies between 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.050
 the two between the two groups so it's good 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.050
 so 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:56.620
 But nine goals in two game matches 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:59.170
 find him two days against him 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.270
 things like that are then 5 to 0 I think it is 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.810
 difficult but also very easy to take 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.570
 the match 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:07.170
 summer standing for half an hour then and then 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.170
 there was no more game
