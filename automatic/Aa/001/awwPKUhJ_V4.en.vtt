00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.850 

so<00:01:29.240> now<00:01:29.330> we're<00:01:29.479> going<00:01:29.630> to<00:01:29.690> install<00:01:29.930> the<00:01:30.140> ATS<00:01:30.590> on

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
so now we're going to install the ATS on

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.490 
so now we're going to install the ATS on
the<00:01:30.950> rope<00:01:31.420> we're<00:01:32.420> gonna<00:01:32.540> run<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:32.960> rope<00:01:33.140> over

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
the rope we're gonna run the rope over

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.039 
the rope we're gonna run the rope over
the<00:01:33.619> hump<00:01:33.799> for<00:01:34.010> added<00:01:34.310> friction<00:01:34.840> we<00:01:35.840> take<00:01:36.020> a

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
the hump for added friction we take a

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:37.649 
the hump for added friction we take a
bite<00:01:36.350> or<00:01:36.500> rope

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
bite or rope

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.219 
bite or rope
we're<00:01:38.659> pass<00:01:38.900> it<00:01:39.140> in<00:01:39.259> the<00:01:39.290> big<00:01:39.560> hole<00:01:41.140> bring<00:01:42.140> it

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
we're pass it in the big hole bring it

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:51.070 
we're pass it in the big hole bring it
down<00:01:45.729> flip<00:01:46.729> our<00:01:46.940> carabiner<00:01:47.450> in<00:01:49.930> that's<00:01:50.930> what

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
down flip our carabiner in that's what

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.080 
down flip our carabiner in that's what
it<00:01:51.200> looks<00:01:51.380> like<00:01:51.560> installed

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.020 

so<00:01:57.090> I've<00:01:57.180> got<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.510> device<00:01:57.810> in<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.610> the<00:01:59.610> start<00:01:59.910> of

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
so I've got the device in a the start of

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.880 
so I've got the device in a the start of
a<00:02:00.090> hard<00:02:00.300> lock<00:02:00.570> here<00:02:00.900> so<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.140> see<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.350> can't<00:02:01.680> take

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
a hard lock here so you see I can't take

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.880 
a hard lock here so you see I can't take

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
above the device and now I can do

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:06.720 
above the device and now I can do
whatever<00:03:04.120> it<00:03:04.299> is<00:03:04.450> that<00:03:04.659> need<00:03:04.810> to<00:03:04.900> do<00:03:05.489> work<00:03:06.489> on

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
whatever it is that need to do work on

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:15.890 
whatever it is that need to do work on
this<00:03:06.940> work<00:03:07.299> on<00:03:07.569> that<00:03:07.829> and<00:03:08.829> free

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.410 

what<00:03:16.900> I<00:03:16.959> want<00:03:17.110> to<00:03:17.140> do<00:03:17.319> is<00:03:17.440> show<00:03:17.709> you<00:03:17.739> the<00:03:18.420> proper

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
what I want to do is show you the proper

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.280 
what I want to do is show you the proper
way<00:03:19.450> to<00:03:19.569> install<00:03:19.959> a<00:03:20.140> repel<00:03:20.560> system

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
way to install a repel system

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.240 
way to install a repel system
particularly<00:03:23.290> with<00:03:23.530> your<00:03:23.799> figure-of-eight

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
particularly with your figure-of-eight

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.220 
particularly with your figure-of-eight
family

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
family

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.250 
family
so<00:03:26.230> we'll<00:03:26.379> install<00:03:26.769> the<00:03:26.950> rope<00:03:27.159> as<00:03:28.019> per<00:03:29.019> normal

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
so we'll install the rope as per normal

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:36.600 
so we'll install the rope as per normal
and<00:03:33.209> we<00:03:34.209> want<00:03:34.480> to<00:03:34.569> have<00:03:35.160> particularly<00:03:36.160> entry

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
and we want to have particularly entry

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.720 
and we want to have particularly entry
work<00:03:36.819> we<00:03:37.030> climb<00:03:37.890> even<00:03:38.890> if<00:03:39.069> it's<00:03:39.220> double<00:03:39.400> rope

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
work we climb even if it's double rope

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.430 
work we climb even if it's double rope
technique<00:03:40.030> we<00:03:40.420> climb<00:03:40.690> on<00:03:40.870> single<00:03:41.290> rope

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
technique we climb on single rope

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.050 
technique we climb on single rope
systems<00:03:42.209> so<00:03:43.209> we<00:03:43.329> don't<00:03:43.510> have<00:03:43.690> the<00:03:43.870> benefit<00:03:44.410> of

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
systems so we don't have the benefit of

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.020 
systems so we don't have the benefit of
a<00:03:46.060> redundant<00:03:46.629> rope<00:03:46.810> back<00:03:47.049> up<00:03:47.760> so<00:03:48.760> when<00:03:48.910> you're

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
a redundant rope back up so when you're

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.210 
a redundant rope back up so when you're
on<00:03:49.180> rappel<00:03:50.910> proper<00:03:51.910> procedure<00:03:52.390> is<00:03:53.019> to<00:03:54.010> backup

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
on rappel proper procedure is to backup

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.500 
on rappel proper procedure is to backup
your<00:03:54.579> device<00:03:55.079> with<00:03:56.079> the<00:03:56.230> prusik<00:03:57.209> you<00:03:58.209> can<00:03:58.359> do

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
your device with the prusik you can do

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:11.630 
your device with the prusik you can do
it<00:03:58.629> above<00:03:58.900> or<00:03:59.170> below<00:03:59.970> what<00:04:00.970> I<00:04:01.000> prefer<00:04:01.359> is<00:04:02.670> above

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:24.690 

so<00:04:12.180> now

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.940 

this<00:04:25.330> repeal<00:04:25.720> device<00:04:26.080> is<00:04:26.290> backed<00:04:26.530> up<00:04:26.800> with
