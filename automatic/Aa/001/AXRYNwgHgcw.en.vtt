00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
olive oil is is don't cook with it why

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.940 
olive oil is is don't cook with it why
well<00:02:06.869> if<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.110> cook<00:02:07.320> with<00:02:07.500> olive<00:02:07.710> oil<00:02:08.069> at<00:02:08.250> high

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
well if you cook with olive oil at high

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.850 
well if you cook with olive oil at high
it<00:02:09.369> actually<00:02:10.179> turns<00:02:10.599> to<00:02:10.989> free<00:02:11.200> radicals<00:02:11.650> and

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
it actually turns to free radicals and

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.619 
it actually turns to free radicals and
that<00:02:11.980> is<00:02:12.160> exactly<00:02:12.370> what<00:02:13.150> we<00:02:13.300> don't<00:02:13.480> want

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
that is exactly what we don't want

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:16.320 
that is exactly what we don't want
because<00:02:14.319> free<00:02:14.800> radicals<00:02:14.830> actually<00:02:15.790> promote

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
because free radicals actually promote

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.320 
because free radicals actually promote
information<00:02:16.690> in<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.349> body<00:02:17.610> promotes<00:02:18.610> aging
