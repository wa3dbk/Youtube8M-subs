00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.970
 a big trend since since 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.219
 several years called Quickdraw 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.660
 jam that involves bringing people together 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.429
 who want to create a video game in 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.630
 the same space for them to put in 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.190
 common their skills 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.960
 this is a little different since 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.369
 we propose to people that it has a priori 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.380
 do not yet have the skills to 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.939
 create a game come anyway and we 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.859
 will give them his skills it's 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.449
 a wonderful opportunity for everything 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.189
 a bunch of young people to be able to 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.599
 come show that now in 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.679
 working and working hard and 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:43.770
 band is able to create something 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:45.539
 from us vittek badly as you know 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.379
 it is now a school that is 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.270
 in two regions 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.850
 as such we simply have 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.309
 decided in order to extend the version becomes 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.610
 create your game on the 12 regions I 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.520
 am in first s 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.250
 to terrasson so at the level of the academy 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:05.680
 of bordeaux than in the first year of his 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.640
 interest in tec life plc 2 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.070
 a set of the hour 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:14.950
 lyon then in engineering school the limit 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:16.990
 it's third but I was expecting 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.790
 not at all at all there was beautiful I was 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.020
 a little stressed still happen in 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.130
 a place I did not know with 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.450
 a program more I did not know 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.770
 to do something that I 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.200
 did not know at all I got you 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.020
 realized that we were selecting on 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.580
 the ability to understand unity has to 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.259
 do a project so I found that 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.090
 really really right and which of which 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.860
 allowed on the final phase as we have 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.080
 decided to allow students 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.520
 to already have a real knowledge and 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.470
 so we did not waste time having to 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.210
 to teach the language to young people before 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.330
 that they can start creating 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.330
 video games 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.520
 united made us available to 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.320
 professional licenses for all 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.150
 weekend to equip all the bugs that 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.750
 really allowed us to move from 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.250
 time a maximum of time with the 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.840
 with students with participants 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.060
 of the event I think it's a great 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.550
 good idea that makes it a 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.410
 discovery for me that makes a way 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.539
 to discover this world wanted to test this 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.220
 weekend to create a game and see if that 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.650
 I like it and it really makes me 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.030
 already participated in one last and this 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.440
 can really him since there was a 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.400
 good atmosphere on the weekend I find 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.200
 it's a good experience to do 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.790
 anyway, and it allows me to discover 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.620
 school really what they do to me so much 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.120
 only by information that can be found 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.950
 on the internet where all that we really live 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.120
 the experience we had music on 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.790
 had despots 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.380
 we know all this was tired 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.489
 but we had to continue it was 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.140
 really nice to be all together is 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.500
 dense and fun in the first place ago 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.150
 obviously work on the part of 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.920
 from all the team of all pandas he 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.760
 about fifteen people are going 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.380
 participate anyway as 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.640
 that framing the event I am 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.050
 permanent my come again jokes to 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.650
 games develops this is where the 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.420
 students 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.220
 he develops games in the 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.690
 epitech laboratory so we are here 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.980
 to frame them to guide them for 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.020
 give them ideas for reflection 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.610
 spent 48 hours working on the 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.360
 development of a most complete game 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.470
 possible 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.600
 so it's still a lot 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.280
 job is also the opportunity to 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.200
 them to have a finalized game 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.880
 so it's a bit of a unique experience 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.380
 its great if I had to summarize it's from 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.640
 work and fun the students who 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.080
 come they have fun they are having fun 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.370
 because there is a good atmosphere because 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.540
 that there are paschal pandas of animation 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.130
 same time it's a job because we 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.050
 only has 48 hours we have to play a game 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.860
 a real good game so it's as much 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.860
 of brilliance that the job
