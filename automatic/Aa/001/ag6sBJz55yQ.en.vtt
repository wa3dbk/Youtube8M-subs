00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 what people of gameplay do i want 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.490
 today and you new fork 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.810
 from me brian brian want and albright 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.560
 does the fourteen year coach at fabrics 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.760
 gaming 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.740
 so today i want a guest on it 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.599
 gameplay images xl today I do the 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.830
 teams on one then hypixel surfs 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.320
 serving herein is actually a kind of 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.460
 yes it is a minigame in minecraft 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.470
 and the intention is that you have the 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.119
 treasure trail and wherever you are 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.039
 for example I am here then it goes now 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.930
 ready that block goes away 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.580
 and so you should try each other bit 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.560
 trying to embed and I'm so 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.640
 pass quickly here and then hopefully fall one 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.030
 swimming trunks 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.100
 yes and there yes it is quite annoying 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.600
 because the flick it comes almost every time 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.309
 it's just how it really is your crap 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.110
 if you have never been with a man like that 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.129
 platform is and you put on table 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.230
 cubes 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.910
 that's not smart you better not to 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.629
 stay on such a platform for as long as 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.460
 you then 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.840
 found the attack of you go right away 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.719
 one down because then the entire ground 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.980
 down there if it is broken and yes that to 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.110
 so it's a bit annoying 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.360
 and yes how often this I never have this 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.309
 game also this bullshit is the see 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.260
 that what so that that so I mean 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.809
 but how many times have I played this 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.010
 this meme in minecraft still very often 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.180
 I don't even know I have I have 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.580
 it didn't even keep up but that makes up for it 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.380
 not out and well I only have one 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.810
 time of four times or so but won 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.670
 then a penny also rock solid luxury then 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.950
 are you just left with team blocks and 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.299
 the other falls just a little faster and 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.250
 then paint yes maybe just two 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.020
 seconds and then fall I know you but 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.330
 well we are here with 12 men i try 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.680
 it's a bit of fun to peel it off 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.869
 how it went and it went well 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.310
 I'm thinking I went and yes I know 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.229
 someone can start running such forms 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.530
 but if you walk and you still love something 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.530
 full longer 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.860
 so yes it just goes on 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.150
