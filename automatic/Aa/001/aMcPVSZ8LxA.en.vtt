00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.420
 tutorial of race and fun tv show here 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.820
 we show you how to pump a gas 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.980
 Safety shutdown itself offered this 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.540
 Safety shutdown is required if 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.360
 to add an electric petrol pump 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.670
 retrofits his vehicle and that is 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.910
 irrelevant, therefore, look at them 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.670
 guide and try them 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.260
 imitate 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.720
 First you need a relay with 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.250
 following construction and relay 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.469
 get it below 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:39.390

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:00.570
 56 75 Now we come to the simple 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.000
 installation they encountered terminal 31 to masse to 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.519
 somewhere a body where good mass 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.850
 is located or directly at the minuspol the 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.430
 battery then terminal 30 to the battery 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:16.080
 pluspol why should be hedged 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:19.200
 then glow 15 to the ignition terminal 50 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.240
 to the starter terminal 1 to the 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.740
 signal cable to the tachometer the 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.040
 should someday turn on the ignition coil 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.820
 hangs and then finally pinch 87 and 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.590
 87 b she could also be called 87a for 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.909
 petrol pump this line should 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.189
 also be secured 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.100
 please do not forget all plus 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.780
 line speak directly ignition 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.689
 cable to the plus pole of the battery as well 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.670
 the line to the petrol pump with a 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.560
 to secure appropriate insurance 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.540
 you should be at least 25 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.180
 Use square millimeter cable for 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.460
 this circuit and the hedge 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.700
 should depending on petrol pump between 5 10 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.350
 ampere and a maximum of 30 at berlin now 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.040
 we show them all in the 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.040
 practical test 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.680
 connect fuel pump release 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.509
 upgrade 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:12.810
 So now we have the switches here 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.120
 ignition a 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.880
 here we test with the current check if 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.990
 current there is the ignition is on 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:26.709
 there is no current there now I press 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.350
 the starter and in the moment comes 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.020
 electricity 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:34.630
 The relay is at this moment 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:38.320
 from the water stream to the stream from 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.360
 rev counter with which the engine continues 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.700
 is supplied 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.239
 this works with a like 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:50.820
 the mechanical old fuel pump 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:52.870
 here the relay will be the relay 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.840
 So the pump is then connected 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:59.080
 over these two cables 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:04.330
 They are then for terminal 87 and 780 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.310
 b responsible respectively 87 or 87a as well 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.769
 is called 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:12.580
 the relay works so here you close 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:15.910
 the tachometer annan terminal 1 here 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:19.989
 this cable runs down here 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.610
 to the ignition coil and here I have it 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.920
 the tachometer connected 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:28.209
 that usually goes to a green one 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:34.750
 or green blue cable then we have 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:36.850
 here stream directly from the ignition that 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.510
 The relay will issue as soon as the ignition 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.980
 on is but the engine is not running so 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:48.959
 for safety if you have an accident 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:52.180
 builds then we have down here we have 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:57.549
 The cable for the starter leads 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:04:01.810
 then down to the occasion of the 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:05.950
 Anlasse sits down here and then there 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.989
 to the top plug 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.030
 so that the relay already sets before 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.769
 the engine is running so sprit promoted 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.650
 as long as the starter is pressed 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:17.380
 will test if the relay too 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.169
 starts or the gasoline pump starts 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:24.180
 if the engine is not running we hang 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.180
 Simply disconnect the cable from the tachometer 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:32.100
 and that means the pump should be now 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.300
 do not run when the engine is running 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.930
 instead, then should be the light 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:40.419
 approach 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:43.440
 here if we only have the engine if only the 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.440
 starter is actuated 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.220
 they have seen 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.990
 only longer at the moment 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.990
 the light is on when the light is on 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.090
 but when the ignition is on 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.270
 Nothing 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:05.000
 you have a safe one 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.180
 safety shutdown for the 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.850
 fuel pump 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.100
 Thank you for many thanks for 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.900
 watch subscribe to our channel if 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.880
 you like it will always show 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.450
 again tutorials and the topic
