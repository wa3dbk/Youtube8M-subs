00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.620
 with more information from the america in 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.970
 america will be facing monarchs 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.870
 morelia this weekend on the court 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.059
 the Aztec stadium 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.719
 I think the team has shown good 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.119
 things 4 wins already in this tournament the 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.890
 truth is that the Turk mohamed out there 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:19.230
 is knowing how to drive very well 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.850
 practically the two teams that have 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.280
 for this tournament and look what he has had 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.410
 no injuries and important minor injuries 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.200
 that of course in the eleven holder of 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.970
 these eagles of America are a 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.940
 situation very very difficult to solve 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.620
 at least the one of paul aguilar like that was with 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.179
 this boy more owner than against tigers 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.679
 it's hard for him to be admonished 

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:42.839
 fast is playing a very good football 

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:44.640
 but it costs him work not afterwards he commits 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:46.289
 a penalty and there he was in the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.940
 training already ruben sambueza that 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.679
 it's good news it was for the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.960
 match against tigers but decide 

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:54.120
 hold it they decide not to precipitate their 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.949
 come back also we saw Paul there 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.899
 Aguilar is saying little by little 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.030
 recovering the Turkish mohamed to these 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.530
 elements to others will not have them as 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.030
 miguel layún who has been operated on 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:13.780
 michael brook time 34 weeks 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:15.310
 I would be tired of chili reaches and good 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.990
 there is the america gonzález the days 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.630
 who tries to physically tune up 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.509
 we saw him running they are being that 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.399
 I work separately an america that has 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:25.930
 won his first four matches is 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:29.259
 one of his best starts of the 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.450
 last seasons but they are 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.909
 aware that they can no longer feel 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.860
 favorites, much less yes and I think 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.479
 than america for the circumstances that 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.700
 comes monarchs morelia to be a team 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.350
 that does not advance in the league mx one could 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.200
 imagine that next weekend in 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.580
 the court of the Aztec already with sangüesa 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.009
 If the sea ​​states to cover the 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.020
 position of miguel layún if he is not 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.700
 neither the madueña boy in state 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.350
 Exactly as they may at some point 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.000
 enable the valenzuela mole as 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.429
 lateral by right and sometime what 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.810
 did Antonio Mohamed in the tournament 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:01.630
 Previous I think you have a team 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.250
 I insist very broad I insist they were already 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.950
 talking about that in the second half 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.080
 time of this program that will happen 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.209
 sprouts wings Raul Jimenez as 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.000
 probable america still has a free 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.760
 foreigner's place or he's going to raffle 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.260
 with martín zúñiga and the güero Díaz Luis 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.760
 king gabriel to make the companion 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.319
 Oribe Peralta because there is no more is used to 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.390
 Oribe is the one who has to find him 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.849
 partner if of course not up is 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.040
 the headline along with raúl jiménez but 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.450
 with this situation of the forward 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.220
 Americanist who leaves the athletic of 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.890
 madrid in a few moments more you 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.170
 will have more information about it 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.970
 today I do not train for the time being anymore 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.090
 I train a moment with ricardo 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.250
 peláez was dominating the ball but already 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.540
 kept good because there is the subject of 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.920
 the eagles of the america we listen to what 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.120
 who said today some 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.600
 footballers at press conference 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.850
 [Music] 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.640
 It has not been very effective for me, that's what 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:57.690
 most important for us we have the 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:00.090
 trust that we know that by applying 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.910
 the well in what he wants mohamed inside 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.710
 of the playing field either attack the 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.990
 rival defend us in our court 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.730
 counterattack we are doing well and 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.620
 that has generated a lot of confidence for us 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.570
 to take advantage of the opportunities that 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.720
 we have had we go very well we go for the 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:18.510
 way we want the first goal 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.130
 is the qualification and if we follow the 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.870
 way like how we have been in these 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.410
 first days because we are going to have that 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.920
 rating this maybe before what's 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.970
 what of what can be planned 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.190
 we stand with our feet in 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.240
 the earth or regardless of what 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.680
 what the media can say 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.910
 communication of what can be written 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.460
 of what can be spoken in the 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.290
 transmissions of the parties we 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.440
 we keep the quad nimes working 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.940
 humbly playing match 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.290
 the approach that asks us 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:52.630
 toni teamwork as when they put 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.670
 goals is also help from the average of the 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.500
 defense to us have helped us a lot 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.480
 the forwards is a pretty team 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.480
 solid we have practically worked 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.460
 much in terms of tours we have 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.160
 studied the rivals and that helps for 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.930
 that the defense becomes more solid and 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.240
 let's hope it continues like that I expected it 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.960
 since they told me I was part of 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:16.390
 I'm going to come from America but I do not 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.519
 I 'm not ready to do anything else 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.720
 to demonstrate on the court to show 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.660
 those who gave me the confidence of 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.400
 bring me to America happy for this 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.860
 professional revenge that was given to me and the 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.289
 I will make the most of 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.659
 the word of moisés muñoz and chepe 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:33.819
 warrior in the case of muñoz we knew 

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:36.580
 all the weight problems that the 

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:38.289
 last season they contacted him with a 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.849
 chemical in food they made her a 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:42.219
 low diet pretty good moisés muñoz 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:43.449
 Today has been a fundamental part to 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:45.129
 America also becomes one of the 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:47.199
 better defenses than it is of the 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:49.780
 tournament two goals are the ones he has received 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:51.849
 the whole of the america by a number 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.530
 most important of those who have scored in 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:55.689
 these four games start 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.430
 season to Juan Carlos in which there 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:59.349
 to say three have been visitor 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.090
 morelia goal has not done so far 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:02.860
 tournament that's why we insist that america 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.629
 in addition to which half is being 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.550
 accommodating the calendar could isolate 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:07.870
 without problems his fifth victory clarified 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.759
 the games have to be played and so on 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.680
 etcetera but today america part as 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:13.930
 great favorite to beat monarchs 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.400
 Morelia reach 15 points and continue 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.169
 keeping that good start streak 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.789
 of the tournament on the other side a chepe 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:20.349
 warrior that comes from atlante in a 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:22.240
 team that decides today what I think is 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:23.529
 adapted very well to what he has asked 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.689
 Antonio Mohamed out there comes the 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:27.310
 rotation with jesus molina chepe guerrero 

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:28.330
 who are the ones who have been taking the 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.800
 midfielder position 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.360
 recovery there is no also comes the 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.650
 possibility for Antonio Mohamed of 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.300
 play the second 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.040
 I see it convenient and especially now 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.800
 with those of jiménez with one with two 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.600
 contentions not having hp warrior and to 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.180
 jesus moliné in that position that 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.490
 can only accompany them and because in 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:48.039
 one of those and if you do not find it or not 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:50.289
 finds that the day that the 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:51.970
 own martín zúñiga be the ideal couple 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:53.680
 for pear touch the place the king does not walk 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.020
 I want to assume that at some point 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.520
 michael arroyo could also accompany 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.380
 to oribe peralta in the attack we insist 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.150
 on the subject in america he has a free 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.190
 foreigner's square his four 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:06.789
 foreigners are paolo goltz gonzalo díaz 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:08.380
 michael arroyo and what I'm missing and Pablo 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:10.169
 aguilar speaks because yavaldo martínez 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.669
 play like mexica 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:15.070
 because there have until September 5 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:17.199
 to be able to look for another foreigner who 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.580
 in this case it will necessarily have to be 

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:20.470
 a center forward to bring it to 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.150
 Mexican football he still knew Antonio 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.070
 mohamed because he does not want to rush either 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.770
 those in this situation do not want 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.539
 buy to buy it seems to me that if not 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.610
 comes to someone in America will be for that 

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:33.280
 situation not for neither the board nor 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:35.440
 the coaching staff bring only for 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.430
 fill a square with the exit of raúl 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.139
 jiménez 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.930
 there is the situation of the america not 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:40.699
 he is 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.680
 as for the numbers in terms of 

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:44.900
 football is going well but the same 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.710
 americanistas know that there are some points 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.710
 fine to improve
