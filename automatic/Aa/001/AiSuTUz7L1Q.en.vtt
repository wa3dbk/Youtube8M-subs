looks<00:01:08.220> playing<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.760> guess<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.810> here<00:01:09.990> we<00:01:10.080> go

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
looks playing I guess so here we go

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.600 
looks playing I guess so here we go
let's<00:01:10.439> see<00:01:10.590> what<00:01:10.740> we<00:01:10.860> got<00:01:13.130> it<00:01:14.130> smells<00:01:14.430> just

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
let's see what we got it smells just

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:38.550 
let's see what we got it smells just
like<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.570> cheese<00:01:16.350> pizza<00:01:17.240> smells<00:01:18.240> just<00:01:18.479> like<00:01:18.570> it

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.539 

well

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:47.740 

to<00:01:43.549> me<00:01:43.700> to<00:01:44.229> me<00:01:45.229> the<00:01:45.740> piece<00:01:46.159> of<00:01:46.400> flavor<00:01:46.670> is<00:01:47.030> not

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
to me to me the piece of flavor is not

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.170 
to me to me the piece of flavor is not
strong<00:01:48.140> enough<00:01:48.170> with<00:01:48.590> this<00:01:48.680> cracker<00:01:49.010> I<00:01:52.180> think

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
strong enough with this cracker I think

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:59.530 
strong enough with this cracker I think
the<00:01:53.300> cracker<00:01:53.540> /<00:01:54.220> overpowers<00:01:55.220> the<00:01:58.540> overpowers

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
the cracker / overpowers the overpowers

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:09.520 
the cracker / overpowers the overpowers
it<00:01:59.690> really<00:01:59.930> it<00:02:01.090> let's<00:02:02.090> say<00:02:02.270> they<00:02:03.259> make<00:02:03.470> sure<00:02:08.530> it

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
it really it let's say they make sure it

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.130 
it really it let's say they make sure it
just<00:02:09.800> doesn't<00:02:10.280> have<00:02:10.489> enough<00:02:10.819> of<00:02:11.720> that<00:02:11.780> pizza

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.690 
flavor it's not horrible folks but it's
nothing<00:02:17.330> extra<00:02:18.170> special<00:02:21.519> seems<00:02:22.519> like<00:02:22.670> the

people<00:02:37.750> I'm<00:02:38.750> disappointed<00:02:38.989> but<00:02:39.500> these<00:02:39.800> are

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
people I'm disappointed but these are

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.170 
people I'm disappointed but these are
the<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:42.170> 2<00:02:42.350> i've<00:02:42.530> reviewed<00:02:42.860> here<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:43.340> buffalo

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
the the 2 i've reviewed here the buffalo

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.470 
the the 2 i've reviewed here the buffalo
wings<00:02:44.450> and<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:45.850> pizza<00:02:46.850> i<00:02:47.000> don't<00:02:47.180> think<00:02:47.239> these

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
wings and the pizza i don't think these

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.930 
wings and the pizza i don't think these
flavors<00:02:47.930> are<00:02:48.079> going<00:02:48.200> to<00:02:48.260> last<00:02:48.670> because<00:02:49.670> they

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
flavors are going to last because they

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.460 
flavors are going to last because they
they're<00:02:50.209> not<00:02:50.239> good<00:02:50.540> enough<00:02:50.810> to<00:02:50.959> last<00:02:51.140> I<00:02:51.290> mean<00:02:51.320> I

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
they're not good enough to last I mean I

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:52.630 
they're not good enough to last I mean I
think<00:02:51.500> this<00:02:51.829> is<00:02:51.950> something<00:02:52.160> that<00:02:52.310> might<00:02:52.519> be

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
think this is something that might be

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.190 
think this is something that might be
out<00:02:52.730> on<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:52.940> market<00:02:53.269> for<00:02:53.299> maybe<00:02:53.570> six<00:02:53.840> months

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
out on the market for maybe six months

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.350 
out on the market for maybe six months
to<00:02:54.350> a<00:02:54.380> year<00:02:54.820> then<00:02:55.820> it's<00:02:56.030> just<00:02:56.120> going<00:02:56.299> to

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
to a year then it's just going to

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.410 
to a year then it's just going to
