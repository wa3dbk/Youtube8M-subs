00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.309
 and how about friends today I bring you a video 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.690
 where I will talk about the most mistakes 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.580
 big ones that commit the community 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.990
 Latin American the ros you've noticed 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.760
 after having stopped playing in the 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.200
 cndh and every time he gives a game of my 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.630
 sister or my girlfriend noticed so 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.130
 super strong and more than anything these 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.929
 errors are focused on the queue of 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.550
 qualifiers and without more than 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:28.580
 introduction those are the most mistakes 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.640
 commons that Latinos commit number 5 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.470
 fight to the selection of champions 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.690
 they must understand a thing for something there 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.000
 the order of selection suppose that I am 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.850
 elastic and effort in which playing top 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.010
 even though they already selected the top ay me 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.810
 ok and he and bleyner together because I get 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.210
 balls and I'll play what to 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.010
 I feel like this more than helping 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.400
 it creates a hostile environment 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.680
 even before starting the game 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.190
 number 4 discuss for the first blood 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.620
 that is the most normal bread every day 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.540
 the most typical of Latin America despite falling 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.420
 first blood is blamed the player of 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.310
 a ridiculous form is insulted and 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.250
 even be disconnected because a 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.630
 ally died and gave the first blood 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.220
 this being the stupidest thing I've ever seen 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.050
 it has no logic 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.910
 to your team for an error that can be 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.260
 fix as easily as the first 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.470
 blood 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.210
 number 3 overestimate the majority of 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.040
 the games of latam believe that they are the 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.840
 best of all and that the universe 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.880
 Who does not deserve them are super players 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.340
 pros but they are really very players 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.020
 believed egocentric and boorish is the 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.150
 first mistake the allies do not doubt 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.260
 insult them and start crying but 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.420
 when they are the ones who commit 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.700
 mistakes blame the team of all of them 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.680
 it can never be the fault they never 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.420
 they did nothing wrong the team knows that 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.980
 is wrong and the team near them 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.590
 lose 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.990
 number 2 here I will include three points 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.020
 which are parts of the same problem number 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.910
 one is not knowing its function this is because 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.250
 example milliner I quote blazers that never 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.320
 they move from their line they pass it far me 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.760
 I never help the other lines by 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.380
 example if smith does not help the top or the 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.590
 bot if it's the top it never helps mid 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.740
 it never helps the jungle they never do anything 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.290
 more than trying to form ok ok 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:15.230
 another example jungles that they spend far 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.660
 I'm 24/7 this is a lot right now 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.190
 the devourer are jungles who think that 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.040
 the devourer is charged to pure form 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.170
 when the devourer gives you charges for 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.450
 assists and murders with the 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.340
 devourer you can try to steal jungle 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.260
 to load it faster with the 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.120
 devourer you have to have one eye a lot 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.430
 more put in the crabs and in the 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.750
 dragon but they do not think it 's 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.460
 arm 24/7 when that's stupid 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.470
 because they do not know their function they do not know 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.630
 what does the object do not know 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.610
 what do cases have now the 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.140
 example of the voice line a voice line that 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.610
 for example when your rivals are 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.430
 they put on makeup they kept fighting 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.549
 like crazy and when rivals return 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.469
 all their lives they have only 100 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.750
 of life and kill them and then in the 

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:01.640
 Game's fault will not use room 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.099
 offensive those parts of not knowing your 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.109
 function never sets in motion in the 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:08.689
 enemy jungle therefore you never know 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:10.909
 where is the enemy jungle and then 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:13.010
 as I mentioned them do not use fly 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:15.079
 offensive but moving is part of not 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.719
 know its function does not know what is it 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:20.900
 that you have at home number one this is the 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:24.980
 most typical happens in all all the 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:27.019
 parties lose a lot of time talking in 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.900
 I do not know what complex of writers 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:33.709
 they have something like that because they subscribe 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.810
 bibles of 20 50 paragraphs saying to 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.730
 everyone that they are the ones that are 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.650
 rat children that are these that are that 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.810
 that I'm the best that I think you 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.370
 you're disgusting that I'm going to report you 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.900
 you're troll that I'm going to approach 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.639
 Now I'm going to this, it 's a big, 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.919
 make that it moves that the 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:51.079
 support are disgusting that the ten know 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:52.639
 form that the winch do nothing that the 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.110
 another jungle and I'm champion that is 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:56.720
 changing mine 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.340
 everything they write all their life that is what 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.110
 they had breakfast that was what they ate that 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.860
 if the girlfriend left that if the mother already 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:06.230
 scolded everything they write but misshapen 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.630
 will do and if they do not worry about being 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.600
 Nor does it aim to put guard either 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.880
 of moving the line help either 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.340
 worry more about writing lose average 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.170
 starting writing that doing something 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.510
 that they should have done and good 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.280
 truth is that the next time they go to 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.070
 blame the trolls and those affected by 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.140
 that they can not climb of these five 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.710
 errors notice which ones are 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.020
 committing 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.810
 If these five errors can 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.290
 arrange three or four I assure you that 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.670
 they will go up much easier 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.980
 mainly point 1 stop 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.800
 waste your time writing 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:46.080
 the oven is a game of making novels or 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.330
 of making bibles or writing poems is 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.630
 a game of focusing on what you are 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.890
 not wasting time writing 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.920
 good friends I hope this video will 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.390
 help really I hope it helps them and 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.700
 if you liked they can like 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.220
 share it share it with your friends 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.780
 try 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.240
 make them see that they are committing 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.220
 mistakes we create a nice community 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.900
 let's try to help a community of 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.260
 form a more pleasant community for 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.330
 everyone 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.400
 I would like you to leave in the comments 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.660
 what do you think and if you think that 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.690
 really these are the five mistakes 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.130
 most common in Latin America if nothing 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.880
 I remember I am a 'break' and see you 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.880
 until next time
