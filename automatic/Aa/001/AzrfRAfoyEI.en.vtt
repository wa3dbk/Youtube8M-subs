00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
spark picks up a current and there's a

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.460 
spark picks up a current and there's a
breaker<00:05:56.350> underneath<00:05:57.280> the<00:05:57.970> flywheel<00:05:58.540> which

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 
breaker underneath the flywheel which

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.670 
breaker underneath the flywheel which
breaks<00:05:59.800> the<00:06:00.040> spark<00:06:00.370> and<00:06:01.260> causes<00:06:02.260> the<00:06:02.380> engine

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
breaks the spark and causes the engine

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.060 
breaks the spark and causes the engine
to<00:06:02.800> fire<00:06:03.600> it's<00:06:04.600> seventeen<00:06:05.350> thousand<00:06:05.800> volts

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.070 
to fire it's seventeen thousand volts

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.060 
to fire it's seventeen thousand volts
with<00:06:06.220> no<00:06:06.370> amps<00:06:06.780> so<00:06:07.780> it's<00:06:07.930> quite<00:06:08.110> possible<00:06:08.620> to

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.070 
with no amps so it's quite possible to

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.310 
with no amps so it's quite possible to
put<00:06:09.850> your<00:06:10.000> finger<00:06:10.240> on<00:06:10.270> the<00:06:10.479> vibrator<00:06:10.690> and<00:06:11.169> draw

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
put your finger on the vibrator and draw

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.230 
put your finger on the vibrator and draw
a<00:06:11.350> spike<00:06:11.710> up<00:06:11.860> around<00:06:12.070> about<00:06:12.280> 12<00:06:12.550> or<00:06:12.669> 14<00:06:12.790> inches

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
a spike up around about 12 or 14 inches

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.510 
a spike up around about 12 or 14 inches
and<00:06:13.419> not<00:06:13.750> get<00:06:13.930> a<00:06:13.960> shock<00:06:14.200> it's<00:06:15.130> great<00:06:15.310> fun

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
and not get a shock it's great fun

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.090 
and not get a shock it's great fun
actually<00:06:15.789> it's<00:06:16.660> a<00:06:16.720> good<00:06:16.900> trick

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:18.100 
actually it's a good trick

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.590 
actually it's a good trick
so<00:06:18.640> what<00:06:18.820> we'll<00:06:18.910> do<00:06:19.030> now<00:06:19.180> is<00:06:19.210> we'll<00:06:19.390> give<00:06:19.480> it<00:06:19.510> a

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:19.600 
so what we'll do now is we'll give it a

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:25.080 
so what we'll do now is we'll give it a
start<00:06:19.900> so<00:06:20.740> essentially<00:06:22.740> we<00:06:23.740> have<00:06:23.830> a<00:06:23.910> coil<00:06:24.910> of

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 
start so essentially we have a coil of

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.280 
start so essentially we have a coil of
coil<00:06:25.450> box<00:06:25.660> here<00:06:25.930> or<00:06:26.140> trembler<00:06:27.040> coil<00:06:27.280> here

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:28.290 
coil box here or trembler coil here

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.450 
coil box here or trembler coil here
there<00:06:29.290> are<00:06:29.410> two<00:06:29.590> levers<00:06:29.980> on<00:06:30.130> the<00:06:30.250> steering

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:30.460 
there are two levers on the steering

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.420 
there are two levers on the steering
column<00:06:30.730> the<00:06:31.660> bottom<00:06:31.960> lever<00:06:32.200> is<00:06:32.620> for<00:06:33.160> throttle

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.430 
column the bottom lever is for throttle

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.640 
column the bottom lever is for throttle
the<00:06:33.670> top<00:06:33.850> levers<00:06:34.270> to<00:06:34.300> advance<00:06:34.900> and<00:06:35.110> retard<00:06:35.470> the

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 
the top levers to advance and retard the

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.850 
the top levers to advance and retard the
spark<00:06:36.570> you<00:06:37.570> cannot<00:06:37.840> start<00:06:38.140> the<00:06:38.350> car<00:06:38.590> unless

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:38.860 
spark you cannot start the car unless

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.250 
spark you cannot start the car unless
the<00:06:39.010> spark<00:06:39.310> is<00:06:39.400> fully<00:06:39.640> retarded<00:06:40.030> this<00:06:40.930> car<00:06:41.140> was

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:41.260 
the spark is fully retarded this car was

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:42.900 
the spark is fully retarded this car was
made<00:06:41.320> by<00:06:41.650> gentleman<00:06:42.010> called<00:06:42.220> Henry<00:06:42.520> Leland

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:42.910 
made by gentleman called Henry Leland

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.360 
made by gentleman called Henry Leland
and<00:06:43.030> he<00:06:43.600> invented<00:06:44.050> a<00:06:44.110> way<00:06:44.290> that<00:06:44.560> you<00:06:44.770> could

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:45.370 
and he invented a way that you could

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.670 
and he invented a way that you could
actually<00:06:45.550> not<00:06:46.300> start<00:06:46.660> the<00:06:46.810> car<00:06:47.020> unless<00:06:47.500> the

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 
actually not start the car unless the

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.530 
actually not start the car unless the
spark<00:06:47.980> was<00:06:48.190> fully<00:06:48.460> retarded<00:06:48.880> and<00:06:49.240> that's<00:06:49.420> a

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:49.540 
spark was fully retarded and that's a

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.300 
spark was fully retarded and that's a
safety<00:06:49.780> issue<00:06:50.080> actually<00:06:50.620> that<00:06:50.770> actually

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:51.310 
safety issue actually that actually

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:54.300 
safety issue actually that actually
causes<00:06:51.580> the<00:06:51.940> car<00:06:52.840> not<00:06:53.020> to<00:06:53.260> fire<00:06:53.590> back<00:06:53.860> on<00:06:54.100> you

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:54.310 
causes the car not to fire back on you

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.480 
causes the car not to fire back on you
and<00:06:54.520> ngu<00:06:55.510> in<00:06:55.660> some<00:06:55.840> way<00:06:56.020> so<00:06:56.490> starting

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:57.490 
and ngu in some way so starting

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.050 
and ngu in some way so starting
procedure<00:06:57.610> is<00:06:58.090> we<00:06:58.300> essentially<00:06:59.880> retard<00:07:00.880> the

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:01.060 
procedure is we essentially retard the

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.350 
procedure is we essentially retard the
spark<00:07:01.230> put<00:07:02.230> a<00:07:02.260> bit<00:07:02.410> of<00:07:02.440> fuel<00:07:02.620> up<00:07:03.060> turn<00:07:04.060> the<00:07:04.210> fuel

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:04.360 
spark put a bit of fuel up turn the fuel

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.730 
spark put a bit of fuel up turn the fuel
on<00:07:05.250> put<00:07:06.250> the<00:07:06.340> card<00:07:06.640> on<00:07:07.350> insert<00:07:08.350> the<00:07:08.500> crank

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:08.740 
on put the card on insert the crank

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.510 
on put the card on insert the crank
handle<00:07:10.290> your<00:07:11.290> two<00:07:11.500> levers<00:07:11.890> under<00:07:12.040> here<00:07:12.340> this

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:12.520 
handle your two levers under here this

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.380 
handle your two levers under here this
lever<00:07:12.820> here<00:07:13.000> will<00:07:13.990> decompress<00:07:14.590> the<00:07:14.860> cylinder

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:15.390 
lever here will decompress the cylinder

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:17.520 
lever here will decompress the cylinder
because<00:07:16.390> of<00:07:16.570> the<00:07:16.630> weight<00:07:16.840> of<00:07:17.020> the<00:07:17.110> sill<00:07:17.320> on<00:07:17.440> the

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:17.530 
because of the weight of the sill on the

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:19.260 
because of the weight of the sill on the
weight<00:07:17.710> of<00:07:17.860> the<00:07:17.950> crank<00:07:18.280> and<00:07:18.430> the<00:07:18.550> 23<00:07:19.060> inch

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:19.270 
weight of the crank and the 23 inch

weight of the crank and the 23 inch
flywheel<00:07:19.810> which<00:07:19.960> raised<00:07:20.170> a<00:07:20.200> couple<00:07:20.560> of

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:20.620 
flywheel which raised a couple of

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.560 
flywheel which raised a couple of
hundred<00:07:20.860> pound<00:07:21.130> in<00:07:21.790> order<00:07:22.030> to<00:07:22.120> turn<00:07:22.330> it<00:07:22.480> over

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:22.570 
hundred pound in order to turn it over

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:26.130 
hundred pound in order to turn it over
takes<00:07:22.930> a<00:07:23.020> little<00:07:23.170> bit<00:07:23.320> of<00:07:23.380> effort<00:07:23.740> so<00:07:23.920> the<00:07:25.140> it's

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:26.140 
takes a little bit of effort so the it's

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:29.810 
takes a little bit of effort so the it's
it's<00:07:26.530> a<00:07:26.620> lever<00:07:27.340> which<00:07:27.550> will<00:07:27.840> decompress<00:07:28.840> in

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:29.820 
it's a lever which will decompress in

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.310 
it's a lever which will decompress in
order<00:07:30.820> to<00:07:30.880> start<00:07:31.240> it<00:07:31.390> there's<00:07:31.990> a<00:07:32.080> little

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:32.320 
order to start it there's a little

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.350 
order to start it there's a little
particularly<00:07:32.950> here<00:07:33.160> which<00:07:33.340> will<00:07:34.180> bring<00:07:34.270> the

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:34.360 
particularly here which will bring the

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.770 
particularly here which will bring the
fuel<00:07:34.720> up<00:07:35.940> just<00:07:36.940> a<00:07:37.000> couple<00:07:37.180> of<00:07:37.300> drops<00:07:37.420> will<00:07:37.630> come

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:37.780 
fuel up just a couple of drops will come

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:43.360 
fuel up just a couple of drops will come
down<00:07:38.020> and<00:07:39.450> all<00:07:40.450> things<00:07:40.720> being<00:07:40.990> equal

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:43.370 

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:46.970 

it<00:07:44.370> should<00:07:44.610> start
