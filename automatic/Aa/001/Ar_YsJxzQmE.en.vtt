Technic<00:01:15.240> I've<00:01:15.360> ever<00:01:15.600> built<00:01:15.869> this<00:01:16.170> has<00:01:16.409> got<00:01:16.590> to

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
Technic I've ever built this has got to

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.670 
Technic I've ever built this has got to
be<00:01:16.770> one<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.310> most<00:01:17.490> complex<00:01:18.680> gearboxes

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
be one of the most complex gearboxes

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
be one of the most complex gearboxes
that<00:01:20.280> I've<00:01:20.400> ever<00:01:20.610> seen<00:01:20.909> now<00:01:21.330> this<00:01:21.479> plate<00:01:22.170> here

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
that I've ever seen now this plate here

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.399 
that I've ever seen now this plate here
or<00:01:23.700> this<00:01:23.850> panel<00:01:24.479> goes<00:01:24.659> on<00:01:24.840> right<00:01:25.020> here<00:01:25.200> but<00:01:25.380> I

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
or this panel goes on right here but I

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.899 
or this panel goes on right here but I
wanted<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.710> just<00:01:25.799> take<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.310> off<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.700> you

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
wanted to just take it off so that you

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.670 
wanted to just take it off so that you
can<00:01:27.030> see<00:01:27.240> better<00:01:27.390> but<00:01:27.869> there<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.470> power

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
can see better but there is the power

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.770 
can see better but there is the power
function<00:01:29.159> motor<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.759> little<00:01:30.210> el<00:01:30.450> motor

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
function motor that is a little el motor

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.160 
function motor that is a little el motor
not<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.290> M<00:01:31.439> or<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.829> XL<00:01:32.280> but<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.579> el<00:01:32.729> motor

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
not the M or the XL but the el motor

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.569 
not the M or the XL but the el motor
that<00:01:34.170> is<00:01:34.290> in<00:01:34.439> there<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.799> that's<00:01:34.920> one<00:01:35.280> motor

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
that is in there and that's one motor

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.020 
that is in there and that's one motor
drives<00:01:35.970> everything<00:01:36.479> on<00:01:36.750> this<00:01:36.869> truck<00:01:37.970> ok<00:01:38.970> so

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
drives everything on this truck ok so

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.310 
drives everything on this truck ok so
it's<00:01:39.329> fantastic<00:01:40.909> ok<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:41.970> book<00:01:42.479> number<00:01:42.630> five<00:01:42.990> is

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
it's fantastic ok so book number five is

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.359 
it's fantastic ok so book number five is
going<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.530> go<00:01:43.680> ahead<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:43.979> complete<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:46.369> but

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
going to go ahead and complete this but

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.910 
going to go ahead and complete this but
I<00:01:47.399> just<00:01:47.670> wanted<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:47.970> give<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.149> an<00:01:48.570> idea<00:01:48.920> to

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
take a look at some of the gear trains
