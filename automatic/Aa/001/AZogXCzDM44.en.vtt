one<00:00:05.390> of<00:00:05.509> the<00:00:05.569> features<00:00:05.930> of<00:00:05.960> this<00:00:06.260> type<00:00:06.500> of

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:06.529 
one of the features of this type of

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:09.129 
one of the features of this type of
product<00:00:07.130> is<00:00:07.310> the<00:00:07.520> fact<00:00:07.760> that<00:00:07.910> poly<00:00:08.389> in<00:00:08.690> essence

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:09.139 
product is the fact that poly in essence

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:11.890 
product is the fact that poly in essence
is<00:00:09.559> actually<00:00:10.400> later<00:00:10.580> than<00:00:10.850> steel<00:00:11.180> but<00:00:11.629> in<00:00:11.750> the

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:11.900 
is actually later than steel but in the

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.840 
is actually later than steel but in the
format<00:00:12.559> that<00:00:12.590> we<00:00:12.799> have<00:00:13.070> it<00:00:13.219> here<00:00:13.580> the

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:13.850 
format that we have it here the

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.630 
format that we have it here the
framework<00:00:14.539> that<00:00:14.750> has<00:00:14.900> to<00:00:15.110> be<00:00:15.230> built<00:00:15.469> in<00:00:16.309> order

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
framework that has to be built in order

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.019 
framework that has to be built in order
to<00:00:16.730> be<00:00:16.850> able<00:00:17.119> to<00:00:17.270> contain<00:00:17.740> the<00:00:18.740> poly<00:00:19.580> or<00:00:19.760> half

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:20.029 
to be able to contain the poly or half

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:22.240 
to be able to contain the poly or half
of<00:00:20.150> the<00:00:20.210> poly<00:00:20.420> actually<00:00:20.960> bolted<00:00:21.350> to<00:00:21.530> it<00:00:21.770> has<00:00:22.040> to

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
of the poly actually bolted to it has to

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.820 
of the poly actually bolted to it has to
be<00:00:22.340> a<00:00:22.370> little<00:00:22.580> stronger<00:00:23.110> when<00:00:24.110> using<00:00:24.500> a<00:00:24.590> steel

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
be a little stronger when using a steel

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.560 
be a little stronger when using a steel
blade<00:00:25.070> you<00:00:25.280> can<00:00:25.310> use<00:00:25.580> a<00:00:25.610> thinner<00:00:25.940> skin<00:00:26.150> and

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
blade you can use a thinner skin and

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.150 
blade you can use a thinner skin and
thinner<00:00:26.780> ribs<00:00:27.140> and<00:00:27.440> weld<00:00:27.740> everything

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
thinner ribs and weld everything

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.040 
thinner ribs and weld everything
together<00:00:28.310> to<00:00:28.700> make<00:00:28.850> it<00:00:29.000> uniformly<00:00:29.570> strong

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
together to make it uniformly strong

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.529 
together to make it uniformly strong
when<00:00:30.950> you<00:00:31.039> have<00:00:31.280> poly<00:00:31.670> there's<00:00:32.059> no<00:00:32.210> way<00:00:32.390> you're

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:32.539 
when you have poly there's no way you're

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:34.360 
when you have poly there's no way you're
gonna<00:00:32.599> weld<00:00:32.960> it<00:00:33.140> to<00:00:33.289> the<00:00:33.379> steel<00:00:33.620> frame<00:00:33.649> thus

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
gonna weld it to the steel frame thus

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.960 
gonna weld it to the steel frame thus
bolting<00:00:35.000> the<00:00:35.149> poly<00:00:35.390> to<00:00:35.780> a<00:00:36.020> semi<00:00:36.980> strengthened

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
bolting the poly to a semi strengthened

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.540 
bolting the poly to a semi strengthened
frame<00:00:38.329> right<00:00:38.930> makes<00:00:39.350> a<00:00:39.470> lot<00:00:39.620> of<00:00:39.650> sense<00:00:39.950> okay

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
frame right makes a lot of sense okay

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.700 
frame right makes a lot of sense okay
it's<00:00:40.940> a<00:00:41.030> little<00:00:41.180> bit<00:00:41.420> heavier<00:00:41.750> yep<00:00:42.140> but<00:00:42.620> the

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
it's a little bit heavier yep but the

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.710 
it's a little bit heavier yep but the
essence<00:00:43.100> of<00:00:43.190> the<00:00:43.310> poly<00:00:43.550> is<00:00:44.000> that<00:00:44.420> when<00:00:44.510> you<00:00:44.600> get

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
essence of the poly is that when you get

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.350 
essence of the poly is that when you get
into<00:00:44.899> wet<00:00:45.140> sloppy<00:00:45.410> snow<00:00:45.860> the<00:00:46.340> water<00:00:46.640> in<00:00:47.060> the

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
into wet sloppy snow the water in the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.100 
into wet sloppy snow the water in the
actual<00:00:48.050> snow<00:00:48.320> itself<00:00:48.739> adds<00:00:49.100> almost<00:00:49.970> a<00:00:50.450> liquid

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
actual snow itself adds almost a liquid

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.290 
actual snow itself adds almost a liquid
frictionless<00:00:51.980> surface<00:00:52.220> to<00:00:52.760> the<00:00:52.910> actual

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
frictionless surface to the actual

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.510 
frictionless surface to the actual
quality<00:00:53.480> itself<00:00:53.899> so<00:00:54.559> poly<00:00:54.860> will<00:00:55.190> give<00:00:55.370> you

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
quality itself so poly will give you

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.220 
quality itself so poly will give you
almost<00:00:55.730> a<00:00:56.000> zero<00:00:56.239> degree<00:00:56.540> of<00:00:56.630> friction<00:00:57.020> to<00:00:57.140> the

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
almost a zero degree of friction to the

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.950 
almost a zero degree of friction to the
rolling<00:00:57.590> action<00:00:57.770> of<00:00:58.100> snow<00:00:58.309> for<00:00:59.210> that<00:00:59.450> benefit

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
rolling action of snow for that benefit

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.470 
rolling action of snow for that benefit
alone<00:01:00.350> you<00:01:00.860> are<00:01:00.890> now<00:01:01.250> looking<00:01:01.520> at<00:01:01.880> less

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
alone you are now looking at less

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.479 
alone you are now looking at less
horsepower<00:01:02.870> needed<00:01:03.440> to<00:01:03.590> push<00:01:03.800> a<00:01:03.829> larger<00:01:04.280> plow

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
horsepower needed to push a larger plow

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.739 
horsepower needed to push a larger plow
you're<00:01:05.239> looking<00:01:05.600> at<00:01:05.719> more<00:01:06.729> covered<00:01:07.729> on<00:01:07.969> a<00:01:08.479> per

00:01:08.739 --> 00:01:08.749 
you're looking at more covered on a per

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:10.629 
you're looking at more covered on a per
pass<00:01:08.990> basis<00:01:09.590> because<00:01:09.829> basically<00:01:10.189> you're

00:01:10.629 --> 00:01:10.639 
pass basis because basically you're

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:12.190 
pass basis because basically you're
throwing<00:01:10.939> it<00:01:11.149> farther<00:01:11.450> you're<00:01:11.689> throwing<00:01:12.020> it

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
throwing it farther you're throwing it

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.230 
throwing it farther you're throwing it
faster<00:01:12.649> and<00:01:12.829> at<00:01:13.429> the<00:01:13.520> same<00:01:13.700> time<00:01:13.969> you're<00:01:14.209> not

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
faster and at the same time you're not

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.699 
faster and at the same time you're not
having<00:01:14.810> to<00:01:14.899> put<00:01:15.049> your<00:01:15.170> foot<00:01:15.350> into<00:01:15.590> the

00:01:15.699 --> 00:01:15.709 
having to put your foot into the

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:17.139 
having to put your foot into the
throttle<00:01:15.950> as<00:01:16.219> much<00:01:16.429> so<00:01:16.639> you<00:01:16.729> don't<00:01:16.909> need<00:01:17.030> the

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
throttle as much so you don't need the

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.840 
throttle as much so you don't need the
horsepower<00:01:17.539> you<00:01:18.200> should<00:01:18.409> save<00:01:18.649> on<00:01:18.829> gas<00:01:19.039> you'll

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
horsepower you should save on gas you'll

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.510 
horsepower you should save on gas you'll
be<00:01:19.999> able<00:01:20.149> to<00:01:20.389> take<00:01:20.600> more<00:01:21.049> per<00:01:21.350> pass<00:01:21.560> and<00:01:22.009> you'll

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
be able to take more per pass and you'll

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.980 
be able to take more per pass and you'll
still<00:01:22.729> have<00:01:22.880> that<00:01:23.060> zero<00:01:23.329> degree<00:01:23.569> of<00:01:23.659> friction

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
still have that zero degree of friction

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.809 
still have that zero degree of friction
on<00:01:24.079> the<00:01:24.170> rolling<00:01:24.469> action<00:01:24.619> we<00:01:25.249> actually<00:01:25.700> do

of the fact they don't have a frame in
that<00:01:57.919> particular<00:01:58.520> case<00:01:58.700> yes<00:01:59.060> the<00:01:59.329> light<00:01:59.539> duty

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
that particular case yes the light duty

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.019 
that particular case yes the light duty
plow<00:02:00.049> may<00:02:00.380> eventually<00:02:00.979> just<00:02:01.279> disappear

plow may eventually just disappear

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:03.999 
plow may eventually just disappear
because<00:02:02.060> we<00:02:02.539> build<00:02:02.810> it<00:02:02.989> specifically<00:02:03.529> to<00:02:03.799> fit

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
because we build it specifically to fit

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.370 
because we build it specifically to fit
those<00:02:04.249> particular<00:02:04.849> compact<00:02:05.299> vehicles<00:02:05.749> so

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
those particular compact vehicles so

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.410 
those particular compact vehicles so
