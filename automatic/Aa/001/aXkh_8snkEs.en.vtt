00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.060 

now<00:01:30.110> this<00:01:30.740> module<00:01:31.310> down<00:01:31.520> here

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
now this module down here

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.550 
now this module down here
which<00:01:33.640> I<00:01:33.790> don't<00:01:33.850> know<00:01:34.030> which<00:01:34.300> module<00:01:34.900> it<00:01:34.960> is<00:01:35.230> I

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
which I don't know which module it is I

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.040 
which I don't know which module it is I
believe<00:01:35.890> it's<00:01:36.160> going<00:01:36.280> to<00:01:36.340> be<00:01:36.400> the<00:01:37.390> relay<00:01:37.810> box

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
believe it's going to be the relay box

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.120 
believe it's going to be the relay box
right<00:01:38.440> here<00:01:38.770> is<00:01:39.030> actually<00:01:40.030> ticking<00:01:40.980> which<00:01:41.980> is

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
right here is actually ticking which is

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.370 
right here is actually ticking which is
another<00:01:42.450> another<00:01:43.450> sign<00:01:44.550> that<00:01:46.380> something's

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
another another sign that something's

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.820 
another another sign that something's
going<00:01:47.590> on<00:01:47.680> with<00:01:47.740> the<00:01:47.920> ECU<00:01:52.200> but<00:01:53.200> any

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
going on with the ECU but any

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.550 
going on with the ECU but any
suggestions<00:01:54.640> would<00:01:54.820> be<00:01:54.910> great<00:01:55.180> and<00:01:55.570> I<00:01:56.290> would
