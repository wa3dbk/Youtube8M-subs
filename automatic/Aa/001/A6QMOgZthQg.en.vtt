this<00:00:18.480> inventory<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:20.039> drug<00:00:20.730> store<00:00:21.090> merchandise

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
this inventory of drug store merchandise

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.400 
this inventory of drug store merchandise
and<00:00:22.760> so<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:24.000> guess<00:00:24.029> they<00:00:24.359> bought<00:00:24.630> them<00:00:24.869> out<00:00:25.080> and

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
and so I guess they bought them out and

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.460 
and so I guess they bought them out and
now<00:00:26.070> when<00:00:26.910> I<00:00:26.939> first<00:00:27.240> saw<00:00:27.510> that<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:27.869> felt<00:00:28.349> that

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
now when I first saw that I felt that

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.330 
now when I first saw that I felt that
they<00:00:28.740> were<00:00:29.779> overcharging<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.199> then<00:00:31.560> taking<00:00:31.949> a

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
they were overcharging and then taking a

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.549 
they were overcharging and then taking a
certain<00:00:32.700> percentage<00:00:33.180> off<00:00:33.390> well<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.260> guess

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
certain percentage off well I guess

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.500 
certain percentage off well I guess
because<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.160> inventory<00:00:35.760> hasn't<00:00:36.329> been

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
because the inventory hasn't been

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.500 
because the inventory hasn't been
depleting<00:00:37.110> itself<00:00:37.670> they've<00:00:38.670> actually<00:00:39.000> came

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
to their senses and now they're taking
