00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.989

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.910

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.719

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.269
 not long monoprix I wanted to 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.190
 try the dry shampoo from home too 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:53.359
 to see he came out not long 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.789
 and I wanted to test 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:57.230
 the smell is cool and he does his job so 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.940
 here again in the hair I 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.859
 finished 7 th tray pro tech of the brand 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.809
 chic very embarrassing brand besides I 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.400
 a lot very much liked good I used 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.799
 not in protector that heat in fact 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.180
 I used just that to add 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.670
 orientation visit in my hair 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.110
 so I tried to find and in 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.130
 then in a drugstore 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:18.920
 I found still say complex the 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.040
 self-builder if confusion 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.140
 this is one of the same brand that smells like 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.210
 same smell and that also moisturizes 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.259
 it's a good serum of a concentrate so 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.340
 that's all I needed for my 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.290
 discolored hair 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.210
 I obviously ended taxes from 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.439
 cherry coloring so this is the rose of 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.030
 the one ripped out direction 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.770
 I do not know when but I'm done 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.060
 but every time I buy them 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.369
 because it's really my brand 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.329
 favorite for the semi permanent the 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.060
 hair coloring 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:46.939
 I will do brand reviews by 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.680
 mark of every semi permanent I 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.420
 know crazy kohler panic demo 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.460
 I will try to buy bim shenzhen if 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.840
 we'll see what happens but for 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.399
 the moment mark challis was really the 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.380
 rich and to finish with the poles of 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.610
 head I finished this gorgeous I know 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.930
 not even how to call it 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.030
 he had bought a preparer and 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.160
 protector of the mark number 4 I 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.900
 believe and it's called winter light 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.220
 I apply it on wet hair it's me 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.270
 Demenais hair and within the ranks 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.520

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.110
 apparently his protected also from the 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.690
 heat me I'm not heat 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.920
 So here I am super recovery 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.420
 to have it finished I think I had it 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.340
 received in a box I think I'm going 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.690
 buy it back to me but let's say that end if 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.370
 it's to buy a single product on 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.750
 a website I am not hyper 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.520
 motivated to do it in fact what has it 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.800
 replaced meanwhile it's a water 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.959
 deep from TimothÃ©e who detangles who 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.700
 makes hair shiny 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.050
 I do not see too much I start it at 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.130
 so I do not have too many opinions 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.560
 still on it 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.450

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.020
