00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.840
 for everyone 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.400
 Gregory Falcons again with you today 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.959
 I want to show you how 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.180
 fire here with such bulbs well 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.180
 naturally with the help of the sun so that 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.200
 on a pack 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.580
 got out the lenses you need into her like that 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.619
 way and pour water how will i 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:31.240
 do otherwise you will crush 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:40.650
 ceramic insulator which is located 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:50.340
 here in this place with small blows 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:50.340
 chuck 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:00.840
 next we need to remove and flagellum 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.840
 gets fucked inside that gas 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.880
 here he is when revealed means look 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.560
 so that the fragments did not fly away 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:13.330
 they resorted to him because they 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:15.909
 then others can hurt so now 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.590
 we need to remove the inside but 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.369
 although in principle you can not clean 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:32.850
 but i'm i'll put the insert inside 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:35.940
 ferns book frame grind here 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:48.550
 grass only 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:59.710
 so yesterday glass is very thin 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:02:01.920
 sharp try them does not leave there 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:06.159
 where do people go all the time 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.979
 better throw someone away or burn and 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.260
 pour water 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:14.700
 for now the panic of retreat from the world is not 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:23.420
 investigating disappear a little wider 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:28.110
 so countdown now rivets so here it is 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.630
 Well, the last part is just now 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.980
 such a flask 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.550
 you were so very similar to those flasks 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.100
 which is used in chemistry therefore 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.570
 if you have a cop 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.500
 chemical who can take that same 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.630
 the most so now our task and and pour 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.390
 by water 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:03:00.120
 we take water, usually a little water 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:03:03.810
 pouring inside that's happened 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.450
 wonderful view. so let's see an hour like 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.940
 it is there that it will increase the increase here 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:13.770
 Healthy so check how she takes herself 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:17.240
 ray so now you see she is very 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.240
 good concentrates narrow to a point 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.380
 so well, what I will try to make a fire 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:29.990
 or at least 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:32.780
 ember so now we will take here and mine 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:36.460
 favorite old cattail which i usually 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.600
 I use a withered aim at the center 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.900
 notice immediately starts to go 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.440
 smoke 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:46.100
 immediately so agreed immediately 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:54.590
 also wait a second 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:04:05.209
 they immediately came here a bit ember 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:08.500
 expanding the case more in size as 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.500
 walk in a circle slightly 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.290
 here 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:35.020
 Well, the cattail began to fumble like that 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.020
 out the story of all that could be seen 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:44.850
 now let's try 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.250
 harvested grass quite a bit 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:52.350
 you do not need now we will do more 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:53.640
 ember and can even make a fire than 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.610
 enemies i like being an athlete and 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:06.860
 smolders it almost does not extinguish if 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:06.860
 break off its ref parameter 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.300
 will lower 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.960
 sportspower 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.330
 that's 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:12.870
 Here I say the words all get by 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:16.050
 the phone rang the night is coming oh chot i 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:18.810
 all the fluff taking off okay you could have been with you 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:21.660
 jackal grigori fire like this 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:24.590
 by conventional light bulbs in all 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.590
 good to new meetings
