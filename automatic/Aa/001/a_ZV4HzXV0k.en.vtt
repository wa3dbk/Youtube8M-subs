00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.750
 7 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:17.610
 how many friends did not the other minor dedicate live and continue or not with 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.130
 the states said other articles 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.500
 The truth has been surprise after surprise since I bought them only 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.390
 can 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.160
 I bought it for competitive 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.149
 the truth is that I've taken 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:31.349
 pleasant surprises this gentleman 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.379
 it's one of those pleasant surprises and it's about nothing more and nothing less than 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:36.199
 President 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:38.680
 in this way they are a source of skeptics 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.219
 chaos classes here we can see that it is a small amphibious vehicle 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.270
 efe rolls very well its barrel points up 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.350
 seriously 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.680
 everything was down 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.110
 You can take it out a little bit because it's in a 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.110
 in a union that allows you to leave 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.140
 pretty level of detail pretty pretty pretty author symbols 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.570
 very well 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.570
 they are well given to us to pay us 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.730
 goes for them boy p 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.940
 the recipe is that many ambulances pass through here and they 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.450
 given previously 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.030
 this boy also what he has apart from that he is a very good one in this one 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.020
 these tests only happens because he does not give 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.360
 a lot for him 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.619
 but anchor when one opens package 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.119
 and transforms it one sees that the one that has enough transformation level two 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.850
 Quite complicated 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.050
 But I'm leaving 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.040
 very very very very very very impressive now to transform it 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.240
 we remove this one that is standing 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.550
 get used to the gentlemen clips 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.580
 feve on the world ship added 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.230
 p asq 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.580
 but good until today 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.580
 I'm but many konko 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.189
 is what we are going to do is that we are going to separate these panels towards the 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:02.850
 sides 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:03.749
 min 

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:06.749
 we are going to download these panels here 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.889
 that form the back of the vehicle 

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:12.179
 this form 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:16.119
 and we are going to carefully separate everything that is these panels 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.769
 that stand out 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.069
 thus 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.849
 and there it seems a bit high 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.199
 it is 209 

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:27.579
 Of robbery 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:31.019
 provisional will rise of coma 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.799
 that advantage was total 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.229
 we stretch our legs this way 

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:38.489
 we lower the feet d the compartment quest inside 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:40.930
 we go down 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.739
 these panels to form the calves we rotate 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.459
 360 degrees 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.480
 more than 160 to 180 degrees now if you look at the transformation when you 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.070
 they are transforming from reverse 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.860
 these panels this changes have to stay in this position so that 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.709
 enter some panels that are 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.349
 there work 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:08.169
 now herning we separate all these unions in this way and upload the 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:10.259
 tires like that 

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:11.090
 and now 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.479
 this gene of this is easy from this one of rl beginning to be 

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:17.269
 small union 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.579
 is sad is essential for the chest to be 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.229
 exemplary well 

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:27.629
 I was not staying by efe then and if it happens to you and it was because of this 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.659
 dirty now we rotate this panel of eta 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:32.139
 there is 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.739
 i this union act i tell you 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.370
 we separated all this towards those sides 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:38.299
 going down 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.249
 this union 

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:44.409
 i'm going, let's go 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:47.409
 I did not disappoint stringer 

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:56.069
 something I am saying wrong 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.629
 duckling 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:59.629
 cannon 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:02.629
 nor in my company 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:07.219
 we passed this union like this 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:12.799
 they are there 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:14.879
 i in san blas 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.430
 when perishing 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.629
 e that this team group k 

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:22.629
 I do not know what happened 

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:26.879
 we turn these to the sides 

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:30.879
 thus 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:35.199
 i'm uploading this panel 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:39.159
 scare 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:42.599
 and we repeat from the other side 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:45.719
 this year 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:48.719
 and there we have friends 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.330
 amper and cher 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.009
 ska rock class 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:56.309
 transformed 

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:59.180
 Ford is desert 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.259
 now 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:03.710
 they justify their face thin people 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.469
 it depends on him 

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:07.990
 the points in favor of this sector 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.990
 it seems a six games that one but 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:12.450
 very pretty 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.659
 very nice possibility 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:15.569
 subscribe 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:17.460
 let me take a little vase the take 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.910
 your arms 360 degrees this way 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.389
 his forearms rotate 360 ​​expected his fists too 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:28.389
 your legs stretch forward 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:36.159
 and you can lose your diego special forces pose 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.949
 i 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:43.949
 I already feel old with those references 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:46.360
 7 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.360
 incidence passed so long since then a bowl 

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:52.400
 but still looking to do it 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.710
 but good in the past other happier matters 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:56.600
 your weapon 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.669
 It is different 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:02.439
 then we can put it there or we can put it back here it was part 

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:05.279
 of the theft backpack 

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:07.560
 we can all put it on the other arm 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.639
 the world 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:11.700
 was astra gentlemen you can do with him 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.009
 what do you want 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:15.619
 his stance 

00:06:15.619 --> 00:06:16.650
 there is 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.400
 friends because they feel that we are 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.069
 is very good 

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:23.469
 there are people who say it's garbage 

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:26.469
 but I think it went wrong or theirs you 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.219
 it's really worth it 

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:30.460
 the museum of everything 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.949
 when one dominates the transformation one thing that I did not do but end 

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:40.379
 percent you can see that they have very good things in their favor 

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:45.249
 the states of john ford skeptics a lot of pretty impressive figures 

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:46.889
 for what they are 

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:50.159
 i recommend it very much 

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:53.949
 I recommend you enforce these rights there also on all the 

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:56.270
 value of the science game if they have more history 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.189
 people this thriller that for some reason that the camera 

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:01.169
 here we say goodbye
