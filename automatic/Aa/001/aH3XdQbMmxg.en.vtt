00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
I think it's like kevin lyman wouldn't

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.790 
I think it's like kevin lyman wouldn't
put<00:00:56.239> us<00:00:56.330> on<00:00:56.480> this<00:00:56.660> if<00:00:56.870> we<00:00:56.989> weren't<00:00:57.230> you<00:00:57.680> know

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
put us on this if we weren't you know

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.860 
put us on this if we weren't you know
somehow<00:00:58.790> relative<00:00:59.420> to<00:00:59.540> what's<00:00:59.720> happening

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
somehow relative to what's happening

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.320 
somehow relative to what's happening
here<00:01:00.260> and<00:01:00.500> I<00:01:01.010> think<00:01:01.339> the<00:01:01.550> music<00:01:01.879> that<00:01:02.000> we<00:01:02.150> make

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:02.330 
here and I think the music that we make

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.140 
here and I think the music that we make
in<00:01:02.449> our<00:01:02.540> stage<00:01:02.780> performance<00:01:03.379> like<00:01:04.159> our<00:01:04.430> music

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
in our stage performance like our music

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.910 
in our stage performance like our music
is

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
is

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.410 
is
it's<00:01:07.520> something<00:01:07.670> that<00:01:07.820> everybody<00:01:08.240> can

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
it's something that everybody can

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.850 
it's something that everybody can
understand<00:01:08.869> if<00:01:09.049> they<00:01:09.170> allow<00:01:09.350> themselves<00:01:09.530> to

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
understand if they allow themselves to

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.090 
understand if they allow themselves to
do<00:01:10.009> it<00:01:10.159> it's<00:01:10.340> not<00:01:10.490> complicated<00:01:10.880> and<00:01:11.659> it's<00:01:11.810> not

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
do it it's not complicated and it's not

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.820 
do it it's not complicated and it's not
it's<00:01:13.100> not<00:01:13.659> revolving<00:01:14.659> around<00:01:14.780> current<00:01:15.350> trends

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
it's not revolving around current trends

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.440 
it's not revolving around current trends
or<00:01:15.950> anything<00:01:16.250> allows<00:01:16.520> you<00:01:16.670> to<00:01:16.759> be<00:01:16.880> yourself<00:01:16.970> so

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
or anything allows you to be yourself so

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.820 
or anything allows you to be yourself so
that<00:01:17.630> I<00:01:17.899> think<00:01:18.290> it's<00:01:18.409> important<00:01:18.770> especially

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
that I think it's important especially

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.950 
that I think it's important especially
