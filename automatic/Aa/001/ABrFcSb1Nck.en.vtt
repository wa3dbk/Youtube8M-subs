00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello to all so I find you 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.460
 today to show you how 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.109
 do I mesfar of time that co 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.370
 so as I showed you in a 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.670
 previous hall I bought 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.049
 a pallet 16 farid from pb 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.000
 cosmetics that shows up like that 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.570
 in which I slipped it from the lighthouse 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.740
 who co I have 16 his grave very well 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.619
 but first I'll drop them for 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.510
 that he gets this bonus looks like 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.220
 it's actually that I can so everything 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.140
 just drag them into my palette 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.300
 since it's exactly the size of 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.340
 lighthouse that's it and you'll find that it 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.420
 do not even need demented it holds 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.010
 all alone so to do that I'm going 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.899
 use the technique of smoothing iron 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.190
 so we need a straightener 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.230
 mine is really simple it's a 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.489
 babyliss nano that I have since a 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.840
 ten years and that I use very 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.010
 very rarely since I only let myself 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.840
 not the flowers of parchment paper so 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.969
 I took a square about 8 per 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.620
 eight is enough 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:58.770
 a country or even in fact it takes a 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.390
 object with a sharp end one can also 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.980
 use a knife or a cutter but 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.260
 frankly I prefer to use whatever 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.430
 something that is not going to hurt me and I 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.729
 not so much want to meet up with 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.430
 emergencies with stitches and one 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.780
 also needs two kiko headlights from a 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.860
 dishcloth to protect his plan from 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.750
 work and I also took a 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.869
 little wet wipes to rest 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:24.750
 lighthouses once so hotties so 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:26.490
 I take my wife that days and we go 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.280
 start by removing the operculum have 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.829
 says it's around the lighthouse 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.869
 I take the fold see that I go under 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.979
 the language is open and by a 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.890
 leverage 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.520
 I go around all around for 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:45.149
 remove from the the little circle 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.829
 that's what it gives and I throw 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.090
 take my sheet of parchment paper 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.670
 it's just to prevent the 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.070
 plastic does not base on the plate I 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.180
 come and put the lighthouse right in the center 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.130
 since the glue point of the headlights that 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.140
 poet in the center and I'm going to let him 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.490
 a few minutes between 2 and 3 minutes 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.969
 of course there I shorten a little bit 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.969
 for the video 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.240
 so do it and at most to mine 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.950
 does not have temperatures and so voila 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.750
 but if you have temperature equal to 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.010
 maximum 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.960
 then when the two three minutes 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.750
 have passed I take the glory fold I 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.120
 put it under the eyes and I come 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.770
 drop the lighthouse on my little age is 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.520
 wet for two to three minutes the 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.520
 time to cool 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.030
 I will do the same for all 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:34.850
 other lighthouses and that's what gives the 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.160
 once- billed casing and left-handed 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.470
 so it will take me a year sales 45 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.700
 minutes to dump but 16 by here 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.120
 what does it give a family in the 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.160
 palette 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.780
 so that's who are not loving and 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.150
 as I told you earlier I 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.230
 did not have any breaks then enough I 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.150
 I'm pretty happy but it's actually 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.340
 true it's super simple to do the 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.990
 glue those facts very very quickly and 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.370
 the more we go in fact the more we have 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.110
 more hotties the following ones become more 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.110
 easy since the iron to smooth and 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.250
 much hotter so I still 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.630
 make a little legend for me 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.290
 so find on a rough paper 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.150
 an envelope 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.160
 I marked the number of mesfar and I 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.590
 think I'm going to do a little painting 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.060
 to glue it to the back of the palette 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.080
 story anyway to know the lighthouses 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.940
 I own 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.190
 here are my listenings and I hope this 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.630
 little video tutorial the unloading of 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.860
 lighthouses which co will have you pleased I make you 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.820
 to all big kisses and I tell you to 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.820
 the next ciao ciao
