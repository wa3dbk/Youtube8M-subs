00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.949 
don't mean he never went to a soccer
game<00:02:22.890> in<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.340> old<00:02:23.489> days<00:02:23.730> but<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:24.630> know<00:02:24.720> in<00:02:24.870> the

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
game in the old days but you know in the

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.809 
game in the old days but you know in the
winter<00:02:25.260> he<00:02:25.349> went<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.709> soccer<00:02:25.980> Noah<00:02:26.280> but<00:02:26.610> I
