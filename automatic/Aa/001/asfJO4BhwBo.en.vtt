00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
seconds and that just indicates that

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.050 
seconds and that just indicates that
that<00:01:46.469> there's<00:01:47.039> going<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.280> be<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.430> kill<00:01:47.789> within

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
that there's going to be a kill within

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.789 
that there's going to be a kill within
one<00:01:48.299> or<00:01:48.329> two<00:01:48.450> seconds<00:01:49.079> on<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.439> either<00:01:49.649> the

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
one or two seconds on the either the

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.859 
one or two seconds on the either the
left<00:01:50.100> or<00:01:50.280> right<00:01:50.340> screen<00:01:50.909> whatever<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.630> green

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
left or right screen whatever the green

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.830 
left or right screen whatever the green
light<00:01:52.049> appears<00:01:52.859> so<00:01:53.219> you<00:01:53.820> try<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.119> use<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.450> and

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
light appears so you try to use that and

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.330 
light appears so you try to use that and
switch<00:01:55.320> your<00:01:55.500> eyes<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.130> particular

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
switch your eyes to that particular

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.870 
switch your eyes to that particular
gameplay<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:58.079> see<00:01:58.289> the<00:01:58.439> kills<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.520> think<00:01:59.759> it

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
gameplay to see the kills and I think it

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.819 
gameplay to see the kills and I think it
works<00:02:00.060> quite<00:02:00.390> well<00:02:00.450> because<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:01.289> know<00:02:01.380> myself

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
works quite well because I know myself

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.580 
works quite well because I know myself
personally<00:02:02.689> watching<00:02:03.689> two<00:02:03.899> screens<00:02:04.320> at<00:02:04.500> the

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
personally watching two screens at the

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.370 
personally watching two screens at the
same<00:02:04.799> time<00:02:05.070> can<00:02:05.369> get<00:02:05.549> slightly<00:02:05.850> confusing<00:02:06.509> so

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
same time can get slightly confusing so

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.180 
same time can get slightly confusing so
at<00:02:07.560> least<00:02:07.649> this<00:02:07.890> time<00:02:08.280> or<00:02:08.970> in<00:02:09.300> this<00:02:09.570> style<00:02:10.190> you

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
at least this time or in this style you

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.530

see Wayne Garcia just get a kill and I

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.839 
see Wayne Garcia just get a kill and I
think<00:02:24.440> it<00:02:24.560> works<00:02:24.739> quite<00:02:25.010> well<00:02:25.069> it<00:02:25.459> just<00:02:25.489> it

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
think it works quite well it just it

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.699 
think it works quite well it just it
does<00:02:26.090> mean<00:02:26.360> that<00:02:26.390> I<00:02:26.660> need<00:02:26.900> to<00:02:26.989> put<00:02:27.140> more<00:02:27.349> effort

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
does mean that I need to put more effort

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.600 
does mean that I need to put more effort
in<00:02:27.800> my<00:02:27.950> videos<00:02:28.340> make<00:02:28.370> some<00:02:29.150> more<00:02:30.610> time

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
in my videos make some more time

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.750

consuming<00:02:32.470> these<00:02:33.470> do<00:02:33.860> scream<00:02:33.890> gameplays<00:02:34.550> are

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.900 
consuming these do scream gameplays are
very<00:02:35.480> time<00:02:35.870> consuming<00:02:35.900> but<00:02:36.739> i<00:02:37.040> think<00:02:37.549> is<00:02:37.670> worth

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
very time consuming but i think is worth

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.940 
very time consuming but i think is worth

for<00:03:14.209> me<00:03:14.420> personally<00:03:15.290> because<00:03:15.769> I<00:03:16.040> like<00:03:16.220> much

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
like this summit this is that summit

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.699 
like this summit this is that summit
week<00:03:19.819> because<00:03:20.360> i<00:03:20.480> believe<00:03:20.720> Monday's<00:03:21.170> gameplay

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
week because i believe Monday's gameplay

of<00:03:21.739> haiku<00:03:22.129> such<00:03:22.610> that<00:03:23.180> was<00:03:23.329> on<00:03:23.450> summit<00:03:23.900> as<00:03:24.049> well

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
of haiku such that was on summit as well

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.770 
of haiku such that was on summit as well
but<00:03:25.220> i<00:03:25.400> really<00:03:25.700> prefer<00:03:25.819> the<00:03:26.150> smaller<00:03:26.420> maps

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
but i really prefer the smaller maps

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.150 
but i really prefer the smaller maps
because<00:03:26.959> you<00:03:27.139> can<00:03:27.290> just<00:03:27.319> rush<00:03:27.709> to<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.040> other

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
because you can just rush to the other

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.900 
because you can just rush to the other
side<00:03:28.430> and<00:03:28.730> it<00:03:29.540> suits<00:03:29.780> my<00:03:29.989> game<00:03:30.019> style<00:03:30.910> but

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
side and it suits my game style but

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.530 
side and it suits my game style but
these<00:03:32.090> big<00:03:32.389> maps<00:03:32.720> I<00:03:33.609> don't<00:03:34.609> really<00:03:34.880> enjoy<00:03:35.030> them

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
these big maps I don't really enjoy them

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
these big maps I don't really enjoy them
but<00:03:35.810> I<00:03:36.019> probably<00:03:36.349> sued<00:03:36.620> by<00:03:36.769> the<00:03:36.799> map<00:03:37.160> hot<00:03:38.560> just

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
but I probably sued by the map hot just

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.530 
but I probably sued by the map hot just
because<00:03:39.920> it<00:03:40.069> refresh<00:03:40.489> the<00:03:40.670> game<00:03:40.880> I've<00:03:41.209> not

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540

the highway the motorway whatever you
want<00:04:36.129> to<00:04:36.219> call<00:04:36.369> it<00:04:36.429> that<00:04:36.729> looks<00:04:36.939> pretty<00:04:37.269> nice

00:04:38.329 --> 00:04:38.339 
want to call it that looks pretty nice

hotel<00:04:39.339> looks<00:04:39.610> funky<00:04:40.119> as<00:04:40.239> well<00:04:40.449> but<00:04:40.689> so<00:04:41.499> pretty

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 
hotel looks funky as well but so pretty

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:44.549 
hotel looks funky as well but so pretty
large<00:04:42.219> map<00:04:42.519> as<00:04:42.759> well<00:04:42.999> Scott<00:04:43.539> elevators<00:04:44.319> you

00:04:44.549 --> 00:04:44.559 
large map as well Scott elevators you

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:46.169 
large map as well Scott elevators you
can<00:04:44.709> take<00:04:44.860> an<00:04:45.009> elevator<00:04:45.279> for<00:04:45.759> I<00:04:45.879> think<00:04:46.089> the

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:46.179 
can take an elevator for I think the

00:04:46.179 --> 00:04:49.799 
can take an elevator for I think the
bottom<00:04:46.479> floor<00:04:46.659> to<00:04:47.199> the<00:04:47.229> top<00:04:47.349> floor<00:04:47.889> so<00:04:48.819> it's

00:04:49.799 --> 00:04:49.809 
bottom floor to the top floor so it's

00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:51.449 
bottom floor to the top floor so it's
going<00:04:49.959> to<00:04:50.019> be<00:04:50.079> something<00:04:50.349> very<00:04:50.769> different<00:04:51.069> to

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:51.459 
going to be something very different to

00:04:51.459 --> 00:04:53.609 
going to be something very different to
what<00:04:51.819> we<00:04:51.879> already<00:04:52.209> have<00:04:52.749> so<00:04:53.289> it<00:04:53.409> should<00:04:53.589> be

00:04:53.609 --> 00:04:53.619 
what we already have so it should be

00:04:53.619 --> 00:04:56.729 
what we already have so it should be
good<00:04:54.419> obviously<00:04:55.419> on<00:04:55.569> the<00:04:55.599> ps3<00:04:55.959> the<00:04:56.319> maps<00:04:56.529> come

playing<00:05:11.409> on<00:05:11.559> PSN<00:05:12.099> again<00:05:12.579> cuz<00:05:13.539> it's<00:05:13.719> been<00:05:13.869> over

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
playing on PSN again cuz it's been over

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:15.689 
playing on PSN again cuz it's been over
two<00:05:14.349> weeks<00:05:14.379> now<00:05:14.739> I'm<00:05:15.039> just<00:05:15.189> going<00:05:15.489> to<00:05:15.549> get

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:15.699 
two weeks now I'm just going to get

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:18.689 
two weeks now I'm just going to get
irritating<00:05:16.709> but<00:05:17.709> anyway<00:05:18.039> this<00:05:18.219> is<00:05:18.399> the<00:05:18.429> last

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:18.699 
irritating but anyway this is the last

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:20.999 
irritating but anyway this is the last
round<00:05:18.999> I<00:05:19.119> believe<00:05:19.419> this<00:05:20.110> was<00:05:20.289> a<00:05:20.319> close<00:05:20.649> much

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:21.009 
round I believe this was a close much

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:24.059 
round I believe this was a close much
and<00:05:21.429> I<00:05:22.419> think<00:05:22.899> we<00:05:23.049> have<00:05:23.079> three<00:05:23.379> one<00:05:23.589> down<00:05:23.860> on

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:24.069 
and I think we have three one down on

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:26.459 
and I think we have three one down on
one<00:05:24.249> moment<00:05:24.459> in<00:05:24.759> time<00:05:24.789> but<00:05:25.779> fortunately<00:05:26.259> we

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:26.469 
one moment in time but fortunately we

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:29.039 
one moment in time but fortunately we
came<00:05:26.679> back<00:05:26.889> we're<00:05:27.639> in<00:05:27.759> for<00:05:28.089> three<00:05:28.389> obviously

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:29.049
