seconds or so till everything is nicely
mixed<00:01:47.460> through<00:01:47.730> you<00:01:47.880> can<00:01:48.060> even<00:01:48.240> do<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.600> using<00:01:48.900> a

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
mixed through you can even do it using a

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.670 
mixed through you can even do it using a
whisk<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:50.840> once<00:01:51.840> done<00:01:52.050> the<00:01:52.200> batter<00:01:52.410> should

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
whisk and once done the batter should

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.530 
whisk and once done the batter should
look<00:01:52.890> like<00:01:52.920> this<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.460> batter<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.300> little

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
look like this the batter is a little

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.540 
look like this the batter is a little
runny<00:01:54.750> that's<00:01:55.050> why<00:01:55.260> I<00:01:55.290> used<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.890> jug<00:01:56.160> with<00:01:56.520> a

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
runny that's why I used a jug with a

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.780 
runny that's why I used a jug with a
spout<00:01:56.940> so<00:01:57.510> that<00:01:57.690> I<00:01:57.810> can<00:01:58.050> easily<00:01:58.320> pour<00:01:58.830> it

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790
