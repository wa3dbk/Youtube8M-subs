a handle in the middle of it now there

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.880 
a handle in the middle of it now there
are<00:00:50.210> two<00:00:50.300> reasons<00:00:50.690> why<00:00:51.080> this<00:00:51.230> has<00:00:51.620> completely

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
are two reasons why this has completely

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.100 
are two reasons why this has completely
changed<00:00:52.309> the<00:00:52.670> fitness<00:00:53.030> industry<00:00:53.180> the<00:00:53.839> first

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
changed the fitness industry the first

is<00:00:54.379> unilateral<00:00:54.920> upper<00:00:55.670> body<00:00:55.960> proprioception

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
is unilateral upper body proprioception

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.259 
is unilateral upper body proprioception
which<00:00:57.260> basically<00:00:58.010> means<00:00:58.339> that<00:00:58.729> these<00:00:58.820> provide

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
which basically means that these provide

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:01.119 
which basically means that these provide
instability<00:00:59.780> for<00:01:00.290> the<00:01:00.409> user<00:01:00.619> because<00:01:01.010> of

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
instability for the user because of

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:03.340 
instability for the user because of
their<00:01:01.250> rounded<00:01:01.580> service<00:01:02.030> and<00:01:02.299> the<00:01:02.869> second<00:01:03.260> is

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
their rounded service and the second is

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.560 
their rounded service and the second is
even<00:01:03.589> weight<00:01:03.799> distribution<00:01:04.269> which<00:01:05.269> means

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
even weight distribution which means

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.270 
even weight distribution which means
that<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:05.990> weight<00:01:06.229> of<00:01:06.619> the<00:01:06.770> ball<00:01:06.950> is

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
that the weight of the ball is

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.160 
that the weight of the ball is
distributed<00:01:07.909> evenly<00:01:08.090> around<00:01:08.570> the<00:01:08.810> user's

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
distributed evenly around the user's

distributed evenly around the user's
hand<00:01:09.760> real<00:01:10.760> quickly<00:01:11.090> I'll<00:01:11.540> tell<00:01:11.930> you<00:01:12.020> why<00:01:12.200> this

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
hand real quickly I'll tell you why this

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.530 
hand real quickly I'll tell you why this

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
first of all the dumbbells flaw is that

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:22.660 
first of all the dumbbells flaw is that
they<00:01:21.049> disproportionately<00:01:21.549> distribute<00:01:22.549> the

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670

heavier<00:01:29.660> the<00:01:30.110> high<00:01:30.320> balls<00:01:30.560> fix<00:01:30.950> this<00:01:31.190> problem

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
heavier the high balls fix this problem

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.760 
heavier the high balls fix this problem
by<00:01:32.210> evenly<00:01:32.780> distributing<00:01:33.380> the<00:01:33.470> weight<00:01:33.500> around

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
your hand so that your muscles are going

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:43.810 
your hand so that your muscles are going
to<00:01:35.630> work<00:01:35.690> more<00:01:36.050> effectively<00:01:36.320> and<00:01:36.860> safely<00:01:42.820> next

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
to work more effectively and safely next

to work more effectively and safely next
the<00:01:43.970> rotating<00:01:44.420> hand<00:01:44.600> will<00:01:44.690> push<00:01:44.900> up<00:01:45.080> is<00:01:45.200> great

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
the rotating hand will push up is great

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.350 
the rotating hand will push up is great
because<00:01:45.620> it<00:01:45.860> allows<00:01:45.890> a<00:01:46.130> free<00:01:46.610> natural<00:01:47.180> range

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
because it allows a free natural range

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.640 
because it allows a free natural range
of<00:01:47.540> motion<00:01:47.930> for<00:01:47.960> the<00:01:48.140> shoulder<00:01:48.560> and

connective tissue and one of the most

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.600 
connective tissue and one of the most
beautiful<00:01:50.840> things<00:01:51.260> about<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.680> high<00:01:51.860> balls<00:01:52.159> is

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
beautiful things about the high balls is

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.100 
beautiful things about the high balls is
that<00:01:52.670> they<00:01:52.909> allow<00:01:53.270> this<00:01:53.540> free<00:01:53.780> range<00:01:53.990> of

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
that they allow this free range of

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.410 
that they allow this free range of
motion<00:01:54.170> as<00:01:54.560> well<00:01:54.800> but<00:01:55.550> you<00:01:55.729> also<00:01:55.909> have<00:01:56.270> the

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
motion as well but you also have the

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.780 
motion as well but you also have the
instability<00:01:57.170> of<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:57.320> rounded<00:01:57.860> surface<00:01:58.310> which

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
instability of the rounded surface which

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.240

pendulum when it swings and this can be
a<00:02:24.720> tricky<00:02:24.990> thing<00:02:25.110> for<00:02:25.470> most<00:02:25.650> users<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.250> perform

a tricky thing for most users to perform

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.330 
a tricky thing for most users to perform
a<00:02:26.640> basic<00:02:26.940> exercises<00:02:27.830> of<00:02:28.830> course<00:02:29.100> with<00:02:29.280> the

a basic exercises of course with the

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
highball this isn't a problem because

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.110 
highball this isn't a problem because
the<00:02:31.260> handle<00:02:31.680> is<00:02:31.860> right<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.640> middle<00:02:32.970> of<00:02:33.060> the

primary wave which is distributed

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.180 
primary wave which is distributed
perfectly<00:02:35.880> around<00:02:36.150> your<00:02:36.420> hand<00:02:39.920> these<00:02:40.920> high
