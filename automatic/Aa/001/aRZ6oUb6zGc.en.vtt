00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
end of this presentation you

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.610 
end of this presentation you
are<00:02:10.899> going<00:02:11.170> to<00:02:11.319> see<00:02:11.590> that<00:02:12.569> we<00:02:13.569> cannot<00:02:14.050> just

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
are going to see that we cannot just

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.979 
are going to see that we cannot just
take<00:02:14.800> a<00:02:15.040> cookie<00:02:15.519> cutter<00:02:15.700> approach<00:02:15.970> that<00:02:16.720> but

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
take a cookie cutter approach that but

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.360 
take a cookie cutter approach that but
we<00:02:17.110> have<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.440> look<00:02:17.650> at<00:02:17.800> each<00:02:17.980> case

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
we have to look at each case

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.920 
we have to look at each case
individually<00:02:21.090> for<00:02:22.090> the<00:02:22.209> purposes<00:02:22.720> of<00:02:22.780> this

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
individually for the purposes of this

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.080 
individually for the purposes of this
presentation<00:02:23.190> we<00:02:24.190> are<00:02:24.310> going<00:02:24.550> to<00:02:24.670> look<00:02:24.790> at<00:02:24.940> the

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
presentation we are going to look at the

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.890 
presentation we are going to look at the
frail<00:02:25.360> elderly<00:02:25.930> as<00:02:26.430> individuals<00:02:27.430> who<00:02:27.670> are

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
frail elderly as individuals who are

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.020 
frail elderly as individuals who are
functionally<00:02:28.900> dependent<00:02:29.110> on<00:02:29.650> others<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:30.670> to

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
functionally dependent on others it to

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.930 
functionally dependent on others it to
the<00:02:31.150> point<00:02:31.420> that<00:02:31.569> even<00:02:32.129> basic<00:02:33.129> daily<00:02:33.400> oral

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
the point that even basic daily oral

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.360 
the point that even basic daily oral
care<00:02:34.239> which<00:02:34.510> actually<00:02:34.810> sounds<00:02:35.190> simple<00:02:36.190> but

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
care which actually sounds simple but

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.140 
care which actually sounds simple but
will<00:02:37.030> be<00:02:37.200> complicated<00:02:38.200> in<00:02:38.379> a<00:02:38.769> regular<00:02:39.280> setting

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
will be complicated in a regular setting

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.119 
will be complicated in a regular setting
whether<00:02:40.450> it<00:02:40.660> be<00:02:40.810> in<00:02:40.840> a<00:02:40.989> nursing<00:02:41.170> facility<00:02:41.440> or

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
whether it be in a nursing facility or

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.339 
whether it be in a nursing facility or
if<00:02:42.580> you're<00:02:42.760> caring<00:02:43.120> for<00:02:43.360> a<00:02:43.390> loved<00:02:43.690> one<00:02:43.930> at<00:02:44.079> home

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
if you're caring for a loved one at home

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.309 
if you're caring for a loved one at home
I<00:02:44.650> know<00:02:45.250> that<00:02:45.730> if<00:02:45.910> you<00:02:45.940> don't<00:02:46.420> provide<00:02:46.720> daily

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
I know that if you don't provide daily

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.830 
I know that if you don't provide daily
oral<00:02:47.890> care<00:02:48.160> for<00:02:48.610> individuals<00:02:48.790> on<00:02:49.510> an<00:02:49.660> ongoing

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
oral care for individuals on an ongoing

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.509 
oral care for individuals on an ongoing
basis<00:02:50.739> it<00:02:51.010> may<00:02:51.549> seem<00:02:51.780> deceptively<00:02:52.920> simple<00:02:53.920> but

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
basis it may seem deceptively simple but

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.640 
basis it may seem deceptively simple but
I<00:02:54.549> want<00:02:54.910> to<00:02:54.970> assure<00:02:55.030> you<00:02:55.360> for<00:02:55.930> those<00:02:56.110> who<00:02:56.379> do

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
I want to assure you for those who do

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.280 
I want to assure you for those who do
that<00:02:57.340> there's<00:02:57.700> a<00:02:57.760> lot<00:02:58.090> of<00:02:58.120> barriers<00:02:58.750> that<00:02:59.110> you

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
that there's a lot of barriers that you

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.650 
that there's a lot of barriers that you
really<00:02:59.709> don't<00:03:00.010> think<00:03:00.220> about<00:03:00.819> and<00:03:01.090> barriers

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
really don't think about and barriers

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.979 
really don't think about and barriers
can<00:03:01.989> change<00:03:02.379> from<00:03:02.650> day<00:03:02.739> to<00:03:02.980> day<00:03:03.220> I<00:03:03.810> reminded<00:03:04.810> of

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
can change from day to day I reminded of

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.990 
can change from day to day I reminded of
yesterday<00:03:05.829> when<00:03:06.099> I<00:03:06.129> went<00:03:06.250> to<00:03:06.579> a<00:03:06.700> nursing

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
yesterday when I went to a nursing

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.259 
yesterday when I went to a nursing
facility<00:03:07.209> and<00:03:08.019> I<00:03:08.530> had<00:03:08.769> to<00:03:09.010> follow<00:03:09.760> up<00:03:10.060> on<00:03:10.209> a

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
facility and I had to follow up on a

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.660 
facility and I had to follow up on a
patient<00:03:10.540> of<00:03:10.900> mine<00:03:10.930> and<00:03:11.470> every<00:03:12.069> time<00:03:12.250> I<00:03:12.310> had

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
patient of mine and every time I had

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.120 
patient of mine and every time I had
followed<00:03:13.090> up<00:03:13.269> in<00:03:13.420> the<00:03:13.540> past<00:03:13.840> she<00:03:14.560> was<00:03:14.769> sitting

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
followed up in the past she was sitting

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.039 
followed up in the past she was sitting
in<00:03:15.310> a<00:03:15.489> jerry<00:03:15.850> chair<00:03:16.269> or<00:03:16.510> sitting<00:03:16.870> in<00:03:16.959> a

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
in a jerry chair or sitting in a

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:19.650 
in a jerry chair or sitting in a
wheelchair<00:03:17.230> so<00:03:18.040> it<00:03:18.220> was<00:03:18.370> quite<00:03:18.549> easy<00:03:18.940> on<00:03:19.269> me<00:03:19.480> to

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
wheelchair so it was quite easy on me to

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.500 
wheelchair so it was quite easy on me to
provide<00:03:19.989> the<00:03:20.200> follow-up<00:03:20.680> care<00:03:20.970> but<00:03:21.970> yesterday

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
provide the follow-up care but yesterday

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.660 
provide the follow-up care but yesterday
when<00:03:22.720> I<00:03:22.750> want<00:03:23.079> to<00:03:23.200> see<00:03:23.440> her<00:03:23.650> she<00:03:23.950> was<00:03:24.130> laying<00:03:24.430> in

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
when I want to see her she was laying in

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.490 
when I want to see her she was laying in
bed<00:03:24.850> she<00:03:25.209> was<00:03:25.359> curled<00:03:25.750> up<00:03:25.989> with<00:03:26.139> a<00:03:26.200> blanket

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
bed she was curled up with a blanket

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.000 
bed she was curled up with a blanket
around<00:03:26.799> her<00:03:27.160> and<00:03:27.459> all<00:03:28.299> of<00:03:28.480> a<00:03:28.569> sudden<00:03:29.010> things

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
around her and all of a sudden things

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.370 
around her and all of a sudden things
were<00:03:30.220> turned<00:03:30.519> upside<00:03:30.760> down<00:03:31.030> and<00:03:31.720> I<00:03:31.900> had<00:03:32.170> then

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
were turned upside down and I had then

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.710 
were turned upside down and I had then
to<00:03:32.590> change<00:03:33.010> how<00:03:33.310> I<00:03:33.340> normally<00:03:33.579> would<00:03:34.209> go<00:03:34.569> about

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
to change how I normally would go about

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.650 
to change how I normally would go about
providing<00:03:35.380> that<00:03:35.680> care<00:03:36.160> because<00:03:37.090> when<00:03:37.299> you<00:03:37.510> are

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
providing that care because when you are

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.800 
providing that care because when you are
bedridden<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:39.220> the<00:03:39.790> systems<00:03:40.359> that<00:03:40.450> used

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
bedridden the the systems that used

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.849 
bedridden the the systems that used
before<00:03:42.000> obviously<00:03:43.000> will<00:03:43.209> not<00:03:43.419> work<00:03:43.750> in<00:03:44.049> fact

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
before obviously will not work in fact

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.400 
before obviously will not work in fact
one<00:03:45.130> of<00:03:45.160> my<00:03:45.459> main<00:03:45.790> points<00:03:46.540> today<00:03:46.720> and<00:03:47.109> those<00:03:47.200> of

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
one of my main points today and those of

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.979 
one of my main points today and those of
you<00:03:47.530> who<00:03:47.680> do<00:03:47.859> provide<00:03:48.220> daily<00:03:48.730> care<00:03:49.150> will

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
you who do provide daily care will

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.259 
you who do provide daily care will
appreciate<00:03:50.680> this<00:03:51.010> slide<00:03:51.370> and<00:03:51.400> that<00:03:51.880> is<00:03:52.090> that

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
appreciate this slide and that is that

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.050 
appreciate this slide and that is that
the<00:03:52.389> difficulties<00:03:53.200> are<00:03:53.470> really

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
the difficulties are really

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.870 
the difficulties are really
underestimated<00:03:55.060> and<00:03:55.329> if<00:03:55.930> if<00:03:56.230> they<00:03:56.470> worked

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
underestimated and if if they worked

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.800 
underestimated and if if they worked
underestimated<00:03:57.880> then<00:03:58.120> I<00:03:58.239> think<00:03:58.480> we<00:03:58.630> would

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
underestimated then I think we would

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.680 
underestimated then I think we would
have<00:03:58.870> daily<00:03:59.560> oral<00:03:59.919> care<00:04:00.160> less<00:04:00.849> of<00:04:01.120> a<00:04:01.209> hit<00:04:01.480> and

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
have daily oral care less of a hit and

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.960 
have daily oral care less of a hit and
miss<00:04:01.959> I've<00:04:02.590> been<00:04:02.919> doing<00:04:03.190> geriatrics

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:10.559 
exclusively for 12 years I go to a lot
of<00:04:07.090> facilities<00:04:07.359> and<00:04:08.079> I<00:04:08.680> can't<00:04:09.010> say<00:04:09.310> that<00:04:09.569> that

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
of facilities and I can't say that that

there's<00:04:10.900> not<00:04:11.079> a<00:04:11.139> concern<00:04:11.799> but<00:04:12.430> I<00:04:12.489> can<00:04:12.790> say<00:04:13.030> at

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
there's not a concern but I can say at

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.680 
there's not a concern but I can say at
best<00:04:13.540> daily<00:04:14.290> oral<00:04:14.680> care<00:04:14.980> is<00:04:15.220> hit<00:04:15.700> and<00:04:15.880> miss<00:04:15.940> and

best daily oral care is hit and miss and

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.839 
best daily oral care is hit and miss and
that<00:04:17.229> is<00:04:17.410> for<00:04:17.620> a<00:04:17.650> number<00:04:17.889> of<00:04:18.010> reasons<00:04:18.130> if

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:18.849 
that is for a number of reasons if

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:21.509 
that is for a number of reasons if
you're<00:04:19.750> a<00:04:19.810> caregiver<00:04:20.530> of<00:04:20.769> a<00:04:20.859> loved<00:04:21.130> one<00:04:21.219> at

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
home you'll know that lack of time

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.530 
home you'll know that lack of time
time<00:04:23.900> can<00:04:24.650> be<00:04:24.680> truly<00:04:25.370> an<00:04:25.639> issue<00:04:25.820> or<00:04:26.030> if<00:04:26.360> you're

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
time can be truly an issue or if you're

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
one maybe lack of motivation and I don't

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.240 
one maybe lack of motivation and I don't
need<00:04:32.360> motivation<00:04:32.960> in<00:04:33.320> terms<00:04:33.590> that<00:04:33.740> you<00:04:34.040> don't

need motivation in terms that you don't

want to provide the care but sometimes

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.540 
want to provide the care but sometimes
the<00:04:37.280> you<00:04:38.270> can<00:04:38.450> be<00:04:38.630> so<00:04:39.100> overwhelmed<00:04:40.100> with<00:04:40.160> other

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
the you can be so overwhelmed with other

the you can be so overwhelmed with other
competing<00:04:41.210> needs<00:04:41.720> of<00:04:42.139> the<00:04:42.350> frail<00:04:42.620> elderly

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
competing needs of the frail elderly

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.909 
competing needs of the frail elderly
that<00:04:43.850> you<00:04:44.210> may<00:04:44.389> be<00:04:44.450> less<00:04:44.840> motivated<00:04:45.530> to

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
that you may be less motivated to

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.310 
that you may be less motivated to
provide<00:04:46.280> the<00:04:46.460> daily<00:04:46.850> care<00:04:47.120> and<00:04:47.389> Moe<00:04:47.900> made<00:04:48.139> it

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
provide the daily care and Moe made it

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.860 
provide the daily care and Moe made it
more<00:04:48.590> motivated<00:04:49.370> to<00:04:49.400> provide<00:04:50.240> what<00:04:50.660> may<00:04:50.840> seem

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
more motivated to provide what may seem

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.090 
more motivated to provide what may seem
like<00:04:51.230> a<00:04:51.290> more<00:04:51.590> immediate<00:04:52.160> care<00:04:52.760> like<00:04:53.510> perhaps

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
like a more immediate care like perhaps

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.070 
like a more immediate care like perhaps
toileting<00:04:55.100> the<00:04:55.520> frail<00:04:55.940> elderly<00:04:56.390> person<00:04:56.960> or

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
toileting the frail elderly person or

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.400 
toileting the frail elderly person or
feeding<00:04:57.710> the<00:04:58.010> frail<00:04:58.280> elderly<00:04:58.760> person<00:04:59.419> the

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
feeding the frail elderly person the

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.220 
feeding the frail elderly person the
other<00:05:01.390> problem<00:05:02.390> that<00:05:02.419> I<00:05:02.600> see<00:05:02.750> quite

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
other problem that I see quite

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.230 
other problem that I see quite
frequently<00:05:03.860> if<00:05:04.190> we<00:05:04.340> take<00:05:04.520> a<00:05:04.580> cookie<00:05:05.030> cutter

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
frequently if we take a cookie cutter

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.650 
frequently if we take a cookie cutter
approach<00:05:05.390> is<00:05:06.080> that<00:05:06.770> the<00:05:07.160> right<00:05:07.340> supplies<00:05:08.060> are

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
approach is that the right supplies are

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.140 
approach is that the right supplies are
not<00:05:09.020> available<00:05:09.710> to<00:05:10.010> provide<00:05:10.190> the<00:05:10.550> daily<00:05:10.910> care

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
not available to provide the daily care

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.420 
not available to provide the daily care
and<00:05:11.419> by<00:05:11.870> the<00:05:11.900> end<00:05:12.169> of<00:05:12.320> this<00:05:12.470> presentation<00:05:12.710> I

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
and by the end of this presentation I

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.850 
and by the end of this presentation I
hope<00:05:13.610> I<00:05:13.760> can<00:05:13.970> open<00:05:14.300> up<00:05:14.419> some<00:05:15.050> of<00:05:15.200> your<00:05:15.290> eyes<00:05:15.530> as

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
hope I can open up some of your eyes as

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.280 
hope I can open up some of your eyes as
to<00:05:16.040> what<00:05:16.220> some<00:05:16.580> of<00:05:16.610> the<00:05:16.880> choices<00:05:17.540> are<00:05:17.930> out

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.290 
to what some of the choices are out

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.830 
to what some of the choices are out
there<00:05:18.620> because<00:05:19.490> if<00:05:19.640> we're<00:05:19.850> routinely<00:05:20.360> just

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
there because if we're routinely just

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.260 
there because if we're routinely just
thinking<00:05:21.229> of<00:05:21.380> toothbrush<00:05:22.040> and<00:05:22.280> toothpaste<00:05:22.520> I

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
thinking of toothbrush and toothpaste I

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.450 
thinking of toothbrush and toothpaste I
can<00:05:23.720> assure<00:05:23.840> you<00:05:24.050> we're<00:05:24.500> making<00:05:24.830> the<00:05:24.950> job<00:05:25.190> more

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
can assure you we're making the job more

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.240 
can assure you we're making the job more
difficult<00:05:25.520> not<00:05:26.270> only<00:05:26.300> on<00:05:26.840> us<00:05:27.169> but<00:05:27.950> on<00:05:28.070> the

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
difficult not only on us but on the

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.310 
difficult not only on us but on the
frail<00:05:28.520> elderly<00:05:28.970> who<00:05:29.270> can<00:05:29.479> benefit<00:05:29.930> from<00:05:29.990> this

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
frail elderly who can benefit from this

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.790 
frail elderly who can benefit from this
daily<00:05:30.740> oral<00:05:31.040> care<00:05:31.310> so<00:05:31.970> there's<00:05:32.210> a<00:05:32.270> lot<00:05:32.600> more

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
daily oral care so there's a lot more

daily oral care so there's a lot more
tricks<00:05:33.800> and<00:05:34.130> supplies<00:05:34.760> and<00:05:35.240> things<00:05:35.270> that<00:05:35.600> we

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
tricks and supplies and things that we

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.620 
tricks and supplies and things that we
can<00:05:36.050> use<00:05:36.080> that<00:05:36.740> will<00:05:37.280> make<00:05:37.460> our<00:05:37.640> job<00:05:37.970> not<00:05:38.270> only

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
can use that will make our job not only

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.900 
can use that will make our job not only
more<00:05:38.930> efficient<00:05:39.770> but<00:05:40.250> it<00:05:40.340> will<00:05:40.490> make<00:05:40.700> us<00:05:40.729> more

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:40.910 
more efficient but it will make us more

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:49.900 
more efficient but it will make us more
effective

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:49.910
