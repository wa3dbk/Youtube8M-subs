00:01:15.349 --> 00:01:15.359 

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:18.149 

slowly<00:01:16.359> setting<00:01:16.869> up<00:01:16.990> the<00:01:17.109> guide<00:01:17.259> line<00:01:17.530> all<00:01:18.100> the

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
slowly setting up the guide line all the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.460 

still<00:01:33.060> keep<00:01:33.240> in<00:01:33.390> mind<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.900> actual<00:01:34.230> way

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
still keep in mind of the actual way

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.860 
still keep in mind of the actual way
patterns<00:01:34.920> in<00:01:35.010> her<00:01:35.100> hair<00:01:35.420> so<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.540> we<00:01:36.630> keep<00:01:36.810> the

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 
patterns in her hair so that we keep the

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.300 
patterns in her hair so that we keep the
haircut<00:01:37.260> even<00:01:39.290> and<00:01:40.290> also<00:01:40.830> so<00:01:41.010> it<00:01:41.070> doesn't

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
haircut even and also so it doesn't

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:51.280 
haircut even and also so it doesn't
become<00:01:41.370> patchy

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.170 

so<00:01:51.830> that's<00:01:52.010> the<00:01:52.100> first<00:01:52.280> blade<00:01:52.580> now<00:01:52.880> i'll<00:01:53.090> be

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
switching over to a two guard and that's

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.280 
switching over to a two guard and that's
going<00:01:58.400> to<00:01:58.460> be<00:01:58.610> the<00:01:58.760> second<00:01:59.270> section<00:01:59.480> of<00:01:59.780> the
