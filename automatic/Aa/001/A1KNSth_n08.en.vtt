with<00:02:15.430> these<00:02:15.519> teammates<00:02:15.940> going<00:02:16.120> at<00:02:16.329> it

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
with these teammates going at it

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.660 
with these teammates going at it
somebody<00:02:17.500> else<00:02:17.620> might<00:02:17.829> have<00:02:17.860> to<00:02:18.099> step<00:02:18.310> up<00:02:18.459> and

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
somebody else might have to step up and

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:19.800 
somebody else might have to step up and
see<00:02:18.819> if<00:02:18.879> they<00:02:18.970> can<00:02:19.120> become<00:02:19.239> a<00:02:19.390> part<00:02:19.660> of<00:02:19.720> it

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
see if they can become a part of it

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.059 
see if they can become a part of it
looks<00:02:19.959> like<00:02:20.079> Jimmie<00:02:20.349> Johnson<00:02:20.680> might<00:02:20.799> be<00:02:20.920> just

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
looks like Jimmie Johnson might be just

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.550 
looks like Jimmie Johnson might be just
a<00:02:21.160> little<00:02:21.190> bit<00:02:21.579> loose<00:02:21.760> right<00:02:22.030> now

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
driving style because what he tried to

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.630 
driving style because what he tried to
do<00:03:32.170> when<00:03:32.380> he<00:03:32.470> first<00:03:32.650> came<00:03:32.860> here<00:03:33.100> along<00:03:33.400> with<00:03:33.610> a

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640

lot of other drivers wasn't working and

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.320 
lot of other drivers wasn't working and
Jeff<00:03:35.860> was<00:03:36.010> willing<00:03:36.310> to<00:03:36.430> change<00:03:36.670> that<00:03:36.940> here

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
Jeff was willing to change that here

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.090 
Jeff was willing to change that here

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
whenever he was testing and so a better

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.949 
whenever he was testing and so a better
