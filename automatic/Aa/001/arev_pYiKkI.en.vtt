00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.289
 is found for a short video on 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.730
 destiny's waiting for you that 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.960
 is fine 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.240
 nickel the potato and so we left 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.460
 for a little video about destiny prison 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.920
 veterans 34 this week on 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.240
 caliciuri paul so that's all 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.699
 I just started telling you 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.920
 that this work that's done here is everything 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.300
 just the very first that I 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.980
 would never have done on quality 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.270
 white that is to say we arrived on 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.559
 say good gloves we will discover this 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.940
 that's the strategy and we each 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.739
 week is to say to yourself go one tests 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.750
 a little bit of everything and we look at what is 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.010
 happens we do that we do that it's 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.450
 that's why you've barely seen 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.000
 arrived I shot in the eye 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.260
 of calix and a ball other than that 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.480
 in the eye it's to see the number of 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.489
 damage that I did and that while during 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.140
 the run at any given time is what 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.160
 when I was going to shoot calix is ​​this 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.449
 that I was going to do him at least two of 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.649
 kids I was going to make him do that anymore 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.850
 this is the first step when I try 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.770
 to discover something is to see 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.080
 if a damage system somewhere 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.210
 in this case it will prove that this 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.369
 is not at all the case 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.750
 why because dancing in this in 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.000
 this work against qualify look there are 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.979
 this boxing who is a valet of art 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.659
 happy if I do not say nonsense and 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.880
 in fact are worth and art account is 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.830
 psychically connected or what you 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.270
 want with calix reborn 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.530
 in fact what happens then 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.960
 I already explained to you how 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.490
 pass this boss just get bumpy 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.979
 there to a ridiculous life 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.450
 you saw him he was shot just 2 3 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.040
 mowers bullets he lost when 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.530
 not even a lot of life and you'll see 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.640
 later in this run simply 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.130
 when calix cancale hic realizes 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.810
 that he has lost a minimum of life he does 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.180
 call to his valets d'art account and his 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.700
 valets of art account is sacrificing himself for him 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.500
 give back his life so in fact he has a 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.740
 life ridiculous but he can regenerate 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.869
 calving nrf stuff the regenerate and of 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.939
 very fast way that's why 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.009
 does the put to kill calix is ​​going to be everything 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.759
 simply to clean the map of his 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.070
 valets count 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.140
 and once there are more there the 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.969
 defense and that's the deduction in 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.259
 the party I remind you anyway that 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.360
 did you make them this video one is 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.250
 at calix once and that was 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.319
 just the first time 15h that 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.999
 there we arrived 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.140
 just a test phase it's all 

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:16.579
 first time we went back into the 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.769
 room facing Cadiz and we fart 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:21.950
 first shot for me this week the 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.269
 34 and ridiculous all the 34 and ridiculous he 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.730
 is within everyone's reach 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.439
 all the steps are to shit them 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.849
 are there is even a stage where there is even 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.299
 no goal in me it's no matter 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.420
 what 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:34.069
 and the boss himself is ridiculous 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.409
 but it's a sick thing and you 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.209
 go see him his life as I said is 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:39.560
 tiny and really does not have a lot of 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:39.829
 life and you saw that the key a little 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.870
 moment 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:44.540
 he said it's no longer marked down to 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.799
 left that he does something with 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.239
 the land where I know what I do 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.219
 reminds more at all is regenerating thanks 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.780
 to the floor not what she did not 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:52.549
 for a while it's because 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.500
 that in fact there are four valleys of art 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.799
 account that they go back by four on the 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.329
 map 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.189
 and once the four are 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.629
 sacrificed some time ago before 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:01.760
 that others are actually coming in 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:04.219
 but look, it's just that we 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.049
 we kill a maximum of valets and when we 

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:08.780
 realizes after twenty 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:10.129
 of seconds that it does not regenerate anymore 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.750
 that if there is no longer the message down to 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:13.370
 left like what it regenerates it wants 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.889
 to say that all the valets of the map are 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.329
 dead because actually the goal is to 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:18.680
 him to withdraw his life for them 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:21.379
 require his valets until they 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.759
 have all needed them and when it's 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.229
 made the envoy that we realize that 

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:25.970
 you have a moment it was good and there 

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:27.650
 he is defended his head he is put all and 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.269
 you look at the speed at which that 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.099
 do not live it's totally ridiculous 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.509
 this is careful when you from him the 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.549
 boss it 's not over when you 

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:35.870
 get pretty much when he's left 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:38.060
 about a quarter of life he invokes a 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.739
 target to kill so I had largely the 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.819
 time to finish calix and once he 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.069
 is dead you find yourself in the lead at 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.169
 head with the target to kill you killed him 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.489
 and now that lille is finished and 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:47.569
 that's how you'll see that 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.099
 it was the first time I 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.720
 did once they got me back boom 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:51.799
 memory card it was the first time 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.019
 that I made it fall that's all 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:56.209
 simply and as I said up the 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.799
 target that appears we kill it we kill it 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.849
 to go alone there is no one on 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.859
 the map everyone died with 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:02.629
 calix and so that's it's settled a 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:04.549
 modifier remove his curls and to 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:06.500
 to do in the pocket so here I hope 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.750
 that this video pleased you and you 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.829
 will help for his next 34 and me for 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.579
 my part i would say next time for 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:13.629
 an upcoming video 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:13.629
 go ciao bye
