00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 the total area of ​​the apartment is 90 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.220
 square meters but it has a living room 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.730
 combined with the kitchen two children's rooms 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.429
 bedroom almost 25 square meters 2 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.680
 bathrooms and storeroom actually 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.990
 designers can work wonders yt 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.420
 push walls to lift ceilings 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.510
 expand space if create 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.140
 interior wisely the first smart detail of this 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.330
 apartments 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.029
 the total area of the family has evolved 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.540
 from the living room kitchen and loggia 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.610
 and now just a very comfortable kitchen room 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.320
 in this case when in the evening everything 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.170
 gather in the kitchen he doesn't seem to be 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.670
 it works just for someone to be in 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.309
 hall lie on the couch and watch 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.039
 TV on is just melancholy and especially 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.020
 when children want to talk and the whole 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.010
 day adults at work and children too 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.090
 doing his own thing 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.940
 then it is certainly because of this. 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.020
 I try to advise this principle 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.440
 customer and 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.140
 do exactly this redevelopment smart 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.960
 the owner agreed with the advice so 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.750
 more that you can make the kitchen and the kitchen 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.479
 living room living room for this need 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.049
 glass partitions mobile doors 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.229
 walls of invisibility either there is no share 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.680
 same between the living room and the former loggia 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:26.250
 the designer fired the loggia from the interior and 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.000
 merit it is one of the reasons for this double 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.820
 glazing 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.729
 makes room space this time 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.710
 this is minus the second used cold 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.810
 better not sinus wrong 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.640
 most often there start to chlorinate 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.680
 some unnecessary things and that too 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.180
 I can not stand I do not understand the logic 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.939
 of this space 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.850
 now everything is logically warm 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.280
 electric floor tiles named cabinet 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.880
 for master is ready the main color in 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.210
 the interior 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.540
 beige then on soft warm and in cover 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.710
 the walls of the floor and in the decoration of the ceiling and this 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.180
 there is also no accident 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.430
 you flat ceiling height two 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.070
 half meter single ceiling 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:10.420
 lowers the space he you do not overstate 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:12.760
 and making here two levels let small 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.580
 levels but 10 centimeters to drop 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.300
 between levels and two levels one of 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.590
 which has a higher glossy ceiling 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.010
 in this case 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:27.100
 ceilings tend to be visual 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.459
 rise to the top of the mirror too 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.090
 gives and the same sensual enhancement 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.910
 ceilings beige color 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.230
 soothing but red is the opposite 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.110
 classic bedroom solved in bold 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.900
 paints even on the ceiling in combination with 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.630
 white is a dazzling effect 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.150
 head up go to the bathroom 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.790
 room in it, too, stretch glossy 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.450
 ceiling too for increased space 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:58.739
 but here all attention to plumbing and 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:02.769
 ceramic tiles in this gang i 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:05.320
 mixed 3 collections this fap collection 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:10.150
 cake collection big flower only 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:15.280
 decor went there and combined these two 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.720
 mosaic tile collections knit three 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.269
 tiles in the bathroom 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.650
 from the three manufacturers by the way such 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.510
 selection is possible only in 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.000
 specialized tile salons and 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.459
 plumbing combination of different textures and 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.400
 drawings manifest individuality 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.500
 so rest assured such a bathroom 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.290
 you will only have on this background 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.350
 especially unique looks plumbing 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.840
 for example corner bath bowl 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.940
 simultaneously saves space and gives 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.030
 swimming pool washbasin 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:50.380
 concise and at the same time 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:53.170
 functional and finally two children with 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:56.200
 one common entrance children are not in a cage 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.930
 but hidden securely difficult to assume 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.989
 that there are two rooms behind one door 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:05.019
 five large rooms on 90 square 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:08.400
 meters designers know how to work wonders 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.400
 if the amount is valid
