00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:06.999
 Welcome to the art of sulfur today 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:11.500
 I want us to make some hearts together 

00:00:06.999 --> 00:00:15.139
 with colorful sugar and we're going to need 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.960
 half cup sugar a teaspoon and 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:21.560
 water mean a shaped cutter 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.420
 edible coloring heart and if 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.170
 they want is optional to put some 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:29.480
 extract to flavor not only 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.410
 we can make hearts but the figure 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:37.370
 that we want the first thing is to take a 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:40.760
 cup with water we will introduce the 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.270
 dye stir well until it is 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.660
 totally uniform 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:51.220
 and with that we will pour it into the container 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:55.000
 that we have the sugar cup we are going to 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:01:00.489
 mix very well so that we have the 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.890
 color well well mixed uniform and 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.490
 we will prepare the dough the dough has to 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:10.200
 be consistent as in our hand 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:13.780
 can be a ball without deforming 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.680
 then on the table we postpone it well 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:20.560
 with a spatula and the shear in 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.300
 this case of the heart we are going to give you the 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.300
 way we press 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:32.790
 and we return to take out the mold and we will see 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.990
 that the mold is completely cut 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.710
 we will take out the surplus 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.920
 then the mold so we can see what 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.840
 well delineated the shapes remain 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.630
 from the heart 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.420
 and we'll put it to dry that depends on the 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.790
 ambient temperature that we have in a 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.550
 couple of hours is fine 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.670
 Then I wanted to tell you also that what 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:02.150
 we can make in silicone molds that 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:05.150
 they are perfect too and finally 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:08.539
 decorate them decorate them in this case in 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:11.750
 celestial that is what stands out most 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.659
 to finish our work we can 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.269
 wrap in cellophane bags that 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:21.049
 they will be very presentable good 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:23.030
 thank you very much for being with us and 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:28.310

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:31.580
 do not forget to visit our facebook 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.840
