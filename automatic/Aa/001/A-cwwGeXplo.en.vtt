00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
I think every league is different the

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.870 
I think every league is different the
German<00:02:47.410> league<00:02:47.590> is<00:02:47.830> one<00:02:48.370> from<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:48.670> best

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
German league is one from the best

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.960
