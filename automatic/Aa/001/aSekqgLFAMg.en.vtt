 Products for 

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:50.189
 I have already tried many employees 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:51.319
 You are a 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.779
 many c they just make too many mistakes so i had to be very calm

 these little leaves show up as a cabaret artist who dominates like that 

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:19.350
 could 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.350

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:24.730
 too bad 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.730
 Well then let's see how far the employer required 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.899
 and if I still think he is okay 

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:31.709
 d

00:04:24.869 --> 00:04:29.609
 Instructions of his boss with chance often was without saying a word or even 

00:04:29.609 --> 00:04:32.859
