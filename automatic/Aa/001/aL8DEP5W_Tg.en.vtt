numbers 7 8 &amp; 9 if you have the

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.679 
numbers 7 8 &amp; 9 if you have the
opportunity<00:01:14.520> as<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.820> probability<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.479> them

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.120 
opportunity as the probability of them
coming<00:01:15.990> up<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.409> lower<00:01:16.650> than<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.979> other

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
coming up is lower than the other

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.219 
coming up is lower than the other
numbers<00:01:17.520> here<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.659> have<00:01:19.200> 1<00:01:19.470> 6<00:01:20.070> which<00:01:20.460> equals<00:01:20.700> 7<00:01:21.330> 1

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
numbers here I have 1 6 which equals 7 1

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.499 
numbers here I have 1 6 which equals 7 1
&amp;<00:01:22.439> 7<00:01:22.799> have<00:01:22.830> already<00:01:23.250> been<00:01:23.400> flipped<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.090> my<00:01:24.270> only

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
&amp; 7 have already been flipped so my only

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:33.530 
&amp; 7 have already been flipped so my only
option<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:25.200> number<00:01:25.560> 6

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.730 

here<00:01:34.540> I<00:01:34.570> have<00:01:34.870> four<00:01:35.110> two<00:01:36.070> which<00:01:36.580> equals<00:01:36.850> six

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
here I have four two which equals six

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.740 
here I have four two which equals six
numbers<00:01:38.740> two<00:01:38.979> and<00:01:39.010> six<00:01:39.610> have<00:01:39.940> been<00:01:39.970> flipped<00:01:40.570> my

numbers two and six have been flipped my
only<00:01:41.110> option<00:01:41.470> is<00:01:41.560> number<00:01:41.860> four<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:44.020> that's

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
only option is number four so that's

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.760 
only option is number four so that's
basically<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:44.950> game<00:01:47.130> one<00:01:48.130> more<00:01:48.340> roll<00:01:49.770> you

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
would be the end of their turn and it

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.900 
would be the end of their turn and it
would<00:02:16.480> be<00:02:16.630> your<00:02:17.110> turn<00:02:17.340> but<00:02:18.340> what<00:02:18.489> they<00:02:18.640> do<00:02:18.700> is

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
would be your turn but what they do is

would be your turn but what they do is
they<00:02:19.330> quickly<00:02:19.780> flip<00:02:20.110> up<00:02:20.350> a<00:02:20.530> number<00:02:20.800> that<00:02:21.370> does

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
they quickly flip up a number that does

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.760 
they quickly flip up a number that does
not<00:02:21.700> equal<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.209> value<00:02:22.660> of<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:22.959> two<00:02:23.170> dice<00:02:25.770> I'll

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
not equal the value of the two dice I'll

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.820 
not equal the value of the two dice I'll
give<00:02:26.950> you<00:02:27.040> an<00:02:27.160> example<00:02:27.250> here<00:02:31.590> here<00:02:32.590> we<00:02:32.800> have

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
give you an example here here we have

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.490 
give you an example here here we have
two<00:02:33.190> sixes<00:02:33.760> six<00:02:34.390> has<00:02:34.720> already<00:02:34.989> been<00:02:35.110> flipped

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
two sixes six has already been flipped

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.789 
two sixes six has already been flipped
that<00:02:35.650> should<00:02:35.920> be<00:02:36.070> the<00:02:36.250> end<00:02:36.370> of<00:02:36.459> the<00:02:36.549> turn<00:02:37.799> but

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
that should be the end of the turn but

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.470 
that should be the end of the turn but
the<00:02:39.010> hand<00:02:39.250> is<00:02:39.430> always<00:02:39.640> quicker<00:02:40.150> than<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:40.450> eye

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
the hand is always quicker than the eye

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.630 
the hand is always quicker than the eye
and<00:02:40.930> they<00:02:41.380> will<00:02:41.500> just<00:02:41.620> flip<00:02:41.890> up<00:02:42.040> a<00:02:42.190> random

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
and they will just flip up a random

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.420 
and they will just flip up a random
number<00:02:43.000> and<00:02:43.200> continue<00:02:44.200> to<00:02:44.320> roll<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.650> dice<00:02:44.890> as

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
number and continue to roll the dice as

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.410 
number and continue to roll the dice as
if<00:02:45.730> nothing<00:02:46.120> as<00:02:46.330> if<00:02:46.690> everything<00:02:47.110> was<00:02:47.230> normal

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
if nothing as if everything was normal

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.900 
if nothing as if everything was normal
I'll<00:02:49.420> just<00:02:49.570> see<00:02:49.720> that<00:02:49.870> again<00:02:50.110> in<00:02:50.170> slow-mo

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
I'll just see that again in slow-mo

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.009 
I'll just see that again in slow-mo
they'll<00:02:51.910> roll<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.299> two<00:02:52.510> dice<00:02:54.390> by<00:02:55.390> rights<00:02:55.720> that
