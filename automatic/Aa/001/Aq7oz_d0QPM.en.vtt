00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
for two days out of this week because

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.660 
for two days out of this week because
I'm<00:01:08.610> gonna<00:01:08.760> do<00:01:08.970> bipod<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.840> blood<00:01:10.200> work<00:01:10.670> so

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
I'm gonna do bipod and blood work so

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.880 
I'm gonna do bipod and blood work so
those<00:01:12.420> two<00:01:12.659> days<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:13.229> know<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.380> probably

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
those two days you know I probably

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.880 
those two days you know I probably
consume<00:01:14.460> less<00:01:14.640> calories<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.890> that's

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
consume less calories and that's

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.350 
consume less calories and that's
probably<00:01:17.250> why<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.610> didn't<00:01:17.909> gain<00:01:18.060> much<00:01:18.090> weight

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
probably why I didn't gain much weight

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.170 
probably why I didn't gain much weight
it's<00:01:18.840> been<00:01:19.049> super<00:01:19.380> busy<00:01:20.060> transitioning<00:01:21.060> to

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
it's been super busy transitioning to

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.690 
it's been super busy transitioning to
phase<00:01:21.420> two<00:01:22.040> so<00:01:23.040> I'm<00:01:23.100> actually<00:01:23.220> surprised

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
phase two so I'm actually surprised

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.570 
phase two so I'm actually surprised
about<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.390> know<00:01:24.509> overall<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.470> gained<00:01:26.310> I

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
about that you know overall I gained I

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.060 
about that you know overall I gained I
think<00:01:26.790> 20<00:01:27.090> pounds<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.350> two<00:01:28.590> months<00:01:28.920> but

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
think 20 pounds in the two months but

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.200 
think 20 pounds in the two months but
remember<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.549> was<00:01:29.729> not<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.000> much<00:01:30.060> about

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
remember this was not so much about

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.730 
remember this was not so much about
weight<00:01:30.509> gains<00:01:30.750> more<00:01:31.049> about<00:01:31.229> my<00:01:31.350> blood<00:01:31.560> work

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
weight gains more about my blood work

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.830 
weight gains more about my blood work
which<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.310> results<00:01:32.759> will<00:01:33.240> be<00:01:33.270> come<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.689> next

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
which the results will be come in next

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.010 
which the results will be come in next
week<00:01:34.400> and<00:01:35.400> remember<00:01:35.610> my<00:01:35.909> bod<00:01:36.180> pod<00:01:36.479> which<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.869> got

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020
