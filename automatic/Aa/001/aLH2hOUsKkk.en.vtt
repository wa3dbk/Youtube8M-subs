00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.320
 Red dwarf 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:26.689
 A red dwarf, according to the HR chart, is a relatively small star. 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:33.040
 The main sequence of the cold. Dwarf red accounts for most stars and 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:39.100
 Its mass is less than the half mass of the sun. Lowest surface temperature 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:47.620
 To 3.5 million. Red dwarf star is a very low quality star, less than 40% by weight 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.850
 sun. Its surface temperature is relatively low energy and 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.420
 The helium gas is slowly passed through the proton-proton chain reaction through hydrogen nuclear fusion. 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.800
 Therefore, the small light emitted by these stars uses brightness, in some cases 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:13.500
 Only reach 1/10000 sun luminosity. The bigger red dwarf is the only one 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:21.540
 About 10% of the sun's luminosity. 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:31.931
 Generally, red dwarfs, transporting from inside to surface energy 

00:01:31.931 --> 00:01:38.390
 It is made by convection. This is because radiation is very difficult due to opacity 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.750
 Internally, it has a relatively high density compared to temperature, more 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:50.439
 Difficult photons travel to the surface, making convection more efficient 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:56.520
 For the transmission of energy. Because it is in a full convection red dwarf, 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.330
æ°¦ will not agglomerate in the core and compare with the biggest star, like the sun can burn 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.630
 The main sequence is left before the proportion of hydrogen is higher. result 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.790
 Is the universe in which the estimated life of the red dwarf exceeds the estimated age, possibly 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.350
 200 million to billions of stars in the years 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.570
 The quality of the eight suns has not yet reached the main sequence. Red dwarf 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.260
 Low quality and even longer time, which means that their development has 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:51.199
 No sufficient data was observed by studying the mathematical model. 

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:56.470
 These models show that the smallest quality stars can become giants 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:04.500
 Red is 0.25 times the mass of the sun; the low mass increases its temperature 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.370
 Face, therefore, its brightness, without increasing its size, becomes 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:17.220
 The blue dwarf turns into a white dwarf. This process is very slow and more 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:25.621
 The small mass of the star, estimated to be, for example, a solar mass of 0.25 

00:03:25.621 --> 00:03:32.060
 It is still the following major, minor and existing today, 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:41.530
 0.08 solar masses, 12 billion years. For stars with a solar quality of 0.16 times, 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:48.510
 For example, it is believed that after the phase of the bantam blue comes more than 25 billion 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.630
 Year in the main sequence, will last for about 5 billion years, during which 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.490
 The starlight there will have 1/3 sunlight and future surface temperatures 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:07.450
 To about 8,500 Kelvin at the end of this phase, thus, if there is an orbiting planet 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:14.239
 Solve this and before that there is a low temperature, you can thaw and give again 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.639
 An opportunity for life to flourish. 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:36.940
 In fact, the red dwarf and other stars are in turn low quality 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.000
 Mainly abandoned as the biggest star, it makes us estimate the age 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.970
 Star cluster, discovering the sequence of mass left from the star 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.900
 Main force. This provides a lower bound for the age of the universe and allows 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.680
 The structure of the existing Milky Way in the local training time scale, 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:06.530
 Such as silver halo and silver plate. a mysterious because there is no solution 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:12.970
 In 2007, there was no red dwarf star, no metal, any element of metal understood. 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.480
 Not hydrogen or heavier. Model prediction of the big bang, first 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:24.340
 The star generation should have only hydrogen, helium and lithium moths. in case 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:31.660
 Among these stars are red dwarfs, which should still be observed today. 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:06:00.640
 But so far has not been determined. 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:06.510
 Red dwarf stars are more common in the galaxy, at least in the vicinity 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:13.220
 The solar system. a red dwarf star next to the sun 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:19.710
 Spectral and visual stars; 30 of the nearest stars, 20 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:26.480
 Red dwarf star. However, due to its low light, the red dwarf can't 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:32.930
 In the interstellar distance, it is easy to observe which is observed, but other classes 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:40.040
 Stars; in fact, there are no red dwarfs that are visible to the naked eye. However, due to 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:47.050
 Their small mass and low surface temperature, the star of this class is the target 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:53.191
 The most promising time is to seek the potentially habitable land of the planet. to 

00:06:53.191 --> 00:06:58.700
 Is the greatest star, experience responding to maximum acceleration 

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:04.780
 They exist around the planet's orbit. This led to the first discovery 

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:12.780
 The exoplanet uses the quality of Neptune Glitz 436B and the first 

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:17.280
 "Super Earth" revolves around Gliese 876.
