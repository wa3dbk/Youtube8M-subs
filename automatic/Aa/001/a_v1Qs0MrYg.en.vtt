whether<00:00:32.720> we<00:00:32.930> completely<00:00:33.320> need<00:00:33.559> this<00:00:33.739> app

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
whether we completely need this app

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.860 
whether we completely need this app
because<00:00:35.960> the<00:00:36.440> website<00:00:37.280> works<00:00:37.940> very<00:00:38.300> well<00:00:38.420> in

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
because the website works very well in

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.400 
because the website works very well in
the<00:00:39.199> Android<00:00:39.620> browser<00:00:40.010> I<00:00:40.900> found<00:00:41.900> very<00:00:42.290> very

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
the Android browser I found very very

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.520 
the Android browser I found very very
well<00:00:42.620> indeed<00:00:42.980> but<00:00:43.940> what<00:00:44.090> this<00:00:44.210> does<00:00:44.510> add<00:00:44.809> is

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
well indeed but what this does add is

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.210 
well indeed but what this does add is
the<00:00:45.830> ability<00:00:46.010> to<00:00:46.250> take<00:00:46.519> pictures<00:00:47.030> and<00:00:47.269> very

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
the ability to take pictures and very

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.649 
the ability to take pictures and very
very<00:00:49.220> easily<00:00:49.489> upload<00:00:49.850> them<00:00:50.089> to<00:00:50.120> Flickr<00:00:50.449> which

very easily upload them to Flickr which

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:52.119 
very easily upload them to Flickr which
you<00:00:50.720> can<00:00:50.809> pretty<00:00:50.960> much<00:00:51.049> do<00:00:51.379> any<00:00:51.589> way<00:00:51.769> with<00:00:51.979> the

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
you can pretty much do any way with the

let's<00:03:17.700> go<00:03:17.819> back<00:03:18.000> to<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.239> main<00:03:18.450> kind<00:03:18.840> of

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:19.189 
let's go back to the main kind of

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:22.159 
let's go back to the main kind of
section<00:03:20.189> of<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.609> app<00:03:20.909> I<00:03:21.239> feel<00:03:21.569> that<00:03:21.780> it's<00:03:22.049> not

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.169 
section of the app I feel that it's not

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:23.629 
section of the app I feel that it's not
the<00:03:22.230> most<00:03:22.379> snappiest<00:03:22.769> up<00:03:22.980> on<00:03:23.129> the<00:03:23.189> wall<00:03:23.310> but

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
the most snappiest up on the wall but

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:24.949 
the most snappiest up on the wall but
that<00:03:23.790> could<00:03:23.970> well<00:03:24.120> be<00:03:24.180> my<00:03:24.419> phone<00:03:24.720> which<00:03:24.930> is

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
that could well be my phone which is

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.509 
that could well be my phone which is
getting<00:03:25.260> a<00:03:25.349> little<00:03:25.470> bit<00:03:25.680> long<00:03:26.250> in<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.430> tooth

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
getting a little bit long in the tooth

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.960 
getting a little bit long in the tooth
now<00:03:27.620> so<00:03:28.620> they<00:03:28.709> would<00:03:28.859> go<00:03:28.979> the<00:03:29.159> Flickr<00:03:29.430> Android

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
now so they would go the Flickr Android

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.670 
now so they would go the Flickr Android
app<00:03:30.090> worth<00:03:30.659> downloading<00:03:30.930> it<00:03:31.440> if<00:03:31.530> you've<00:03:31.650> got
