00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.940 
design your game they have a throttle
that<00:01:57.090> allows<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.659> rate<00:01:57.899> lower<00:01:58.439> raise<00:01:58.920> a

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
that allows you to rate lower raise a

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.740 
that allows you to rate lower raise a
bar<00:01:59.460> depending<00:01:59.790> upon<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.270> height<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.630> your

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
bar depending upon the height of your

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.840 
bar depending upon the height of your
guys<00:02:00.990> if<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.920> have<00:02:02.009> younger<00:02:02.219> guys<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.700> maybe

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
guys if you have younger guys that maybe

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.660 
guys if you have younger guys that maybe
can't<00:02:03.180> shoot<00:02:03.420> over<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.750> six<00:02:04.020> foot<00:02:04.259> goal<00:02:04.670> all

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
can't shoot over a six foot goal all

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.059 
can't shoot over a six foot goal all
right<00:02:05.790> now<00:02:05.939> everybody's<00:02:06.360> change<00:02:06.630> lines

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069 
right now everybody's change lines

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:09.380 
right now everybody's change lines
that's<00:02:08.069> why<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.340> don't<00:02:08.550> change<00:02:08.759> lines<00:02:09.090> cuz

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
that's why you don't change lines cuz

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.869 
that's why you don't change lines cuz
you<00:02:09.450> run<00:02:09.569> into<00:02:09.750> each<00:02:09.840> other<00:02:10.340> when<00:02:11.340> I'm<00:02:11.520> done

I<00:02:46.910> very<00:02:47.910> rarely<00:02:48.380> allow<00:02:49.380> my<00:02:49.739> players<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.370> change

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
I very rarely allow my players to change

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.809 
I very rarely allow my players to change
lines<00:02:51.260> why<00:02:52.260> because<00:02:53.100> they<00:02:53.220> can't<00:02:53.430> do<00:02:53.640> that

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
lines why because they can't do that

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.350 
lines why because they can't do that
they<00:02:54.290> screw<00:02:55.290> it<00:02:55.319> up<00:02:55.440> all<00:02:56.370> right<00:02:56.430> so<00:02:56.670> we<00:02:57.120> try<00:02:57.299> to

they screw it up all right so we try to

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.210 
they screw it up all right so we try to
take<00:02:57.569> a<00:02:57.600> little<00:02:57.750> more<00:02:57.870> control<00:02:58.170> and<00:02:58.560> we<00:02:58.920> change

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
take a little more control and we change

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.640 
take a little more control and we change
the<00:02:59.340> lines<00:02:59.549> for<00:02:59.910> them<00:03:00.200> when<00:03:01.200> I<00:03:01.260> coached<00:03:01.530> the

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
would put two goals in front of the goal

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.070 
would put two goals in front of the goal
in<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.200> crease<00:03:07.440> at<00:03:07.680> an<00:03:08.160> angle<00:03:08.810> now<00:03:09.810> we<00:03:09.870> have
