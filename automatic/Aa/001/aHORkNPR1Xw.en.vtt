00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
roles so for me those things come easily

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.299 
roles so for me those things come easily
but<00:00:33.540> these<00:00:33.660> are<00:00:33.870> as<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.320> said<00:00:34.590> it's<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:35.070> rarity

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
but these are as I said it's a rarity

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.549 
but these are as I said it's a rarity
that<00:00:35.820> these<00:00:36.300> kind<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.719> roles<00:00:36.960> come<00:00:37.200> your<00:00:37.380> way

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
that these kind of roles come your way

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.299 
that these kind of roles come your way
and<00:00:37.940> you<00:00:38.940> have<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.960> take<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.350> take<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.800> plunge

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
and you have to take it take the plunge

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.670 
and you have to take it take the plunge
and<00:00:41.579> as<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.239> get<00:00:42.450> older<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.320> should<00:00:43.530> say

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
and as you get older and I should say

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.290 
and as you get older and I should say
sexier<00:00:44.160> because<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.640> haven't<00:00:44.969> looked<00:00:45.120> better

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
sexier because you haven't looked better

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.690 
sexier because you haven't looked better
in<00:00:45.750> your<00:00:46.320> own<00:00:46.440> admission<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.950> have<00:00:47.190> not<00:00:47.340> done

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
in your own admission you have not done

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.600 
in your own admission you have not done
so<00:00:48.090> does<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.809> get<00:00:48.960> harder<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.620> play<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.250> hot

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
so does it get harder to play the hot

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.549 
so does it get harder to play the hot
intimate<00:00:51.120> scenes<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.350> know<00:00:52.469> you

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
intimate scenes that you know you

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.229

started<00:00:52.949> your<00:00:53.039> career<00:00:53.250> with<00:00:53.579> does<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.090> get

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
started your career with does it get

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.770 
started your career with does it get
harder<00:00:54.539> or<00:00:54.690> easier<00:00:55.940> no<00:00:56.940> it's<00:00:57.270> still<00:00:57.539> tough

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
harder or easier no it's still tough

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.799 
harder or easier no it's still tough
because<00:00:58.399> the<00:00:59.399> other<00:00:59.550> person<00:00:59.699> is<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:01.370> stranger
