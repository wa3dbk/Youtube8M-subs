00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:12.700
 any video I bring you news 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.980
 about the future series of dragon ball 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.369
 before starting I want to clarify some 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:21.130
 things I like all of you I'm just a 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.859
 great fan of this series so fabulous and 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.230
 spectacular like you this series 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:29.470
 I fill my childhood with joy and joy 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.890
 I dream like a fan more but with desire 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.289
 to distribute this series this anime this 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.250
 beautiful magical world of dragon ball a 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:39.680
 future generations 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.540
 I as a fan and as the only 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.330
 administrator of this youtube page 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.280
 I apologize to them because as 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.160
 many fans let me take news 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.070
 false false images interviews 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.960
 false and fake people in two of my 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.379
 videos talk about a story that 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.720
 even to me it seemed unnatural 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.120
 I think the desire to see goku and all 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.610
 his friends in action once again he 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.619
 they seized me and made me believe 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.869
 things that are irrelevant but 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.540
 I will explain more in depth a little more 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:14.570
 forward in the video let's move on to the 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.580
 news on March 30 premiered the 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.890
 movie battle of the gods in japan 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.810
 and on September 13 they launched the 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.300
 movie in bluray but in the edition 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.250
 limited there was a small booklet where 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.130
 akira toriyama left a small message 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.009
 for all fans of dragon ball this 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.110
 it was the message it was the first time 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.539
 that I participate in the story for a 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.750
 movie of the dragon ball but that's not 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.039
 it means that he got involved 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.190
 but while thinking that the 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:45.400
 concept of the story he receives 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:48.190
 it was good the content was a bit 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.640
 dark and by making some changes to 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.890
 I let myself be carried away and finished 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.720
 turning it into a story almost 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.070
 completely different that is the way 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.170
 correct to say it 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.630
 since the creator was the one who made 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.060
 the changes I suppose could have 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.340
 caused a lot of problems for the 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.030
 production people for the screenwriter 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.850
 josu that particular ship fucking not 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.220
 it should have been nice though 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.250
 since it is the first animated film of 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.050
 dragon ball in a long time I had the 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.960
 intention to make people 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.780
 will familiarize with it not only through 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:29.200
 fight but to enjoy this fool 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.330
 world animated to the maximum besides things 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.790
 how to get involved in the god's world 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.520
 of destruction the changes of vegueta 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.650
 and the fact that goku did not get the 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.750
 victory were things that would be very 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.790
 difficult to touch if I had not done 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.680
 the original creator of the series the 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.890
 last part in particular where the 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.530
 protagonist gokuh is unable to win 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.500
 a slightly dangerous bet when doing 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.990
 I had the opportunity to keep the 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.540
 The dignity of bills was rumored from the 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:01.660
 home that he was the strongest being that 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.700
 existed with respect to goku incorporates a 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.860
 message that probably has a leisure 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.320
 in the future dragon ball has not yet 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.630
 finished for the battle scenes 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.850
 wrote a rough idea of the 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.130
 combats and leave the rest to the 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.870
 animation professionals thanks to 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.690
 they became powerful 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.610
 fighting scenes that I would not have been 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.250
 able to create 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.410
 this kind of thing is the fruit of 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.020
 various techniques used by 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.330
 professionals that can be found 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:34.120
 only in the mission the protagonist 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.190
 Gokuh is strong and hard a good person 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.460
 but she is also obsessed with 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.500
 battles in case lost a human being 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.470
 who has some problems as parents 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.500
 however for some reason it has a 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.830
 mysterious and cheerful charm that keeps 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.900
 your circle of friendship growing if you 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.380
 You can enjoy the world of dragon ball 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.440
 without thinking about anything just letting you take 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:01.810
 I will be happy good guys this is the 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.850
 message that left akira although many 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.209
 fans like all of us decided 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.830
 get ahead and create stories and images 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.170
 even network sites completely 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.830
 false which has nothing wrong 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:17.290
 but it was something that confused me 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.620
 same as many fans therefore the 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:23.080
 videos where he talked about these sagas 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:25.450
 characters the more they will be deleted 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.730
 recreated and uploaded as possible 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.430
 theories 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.590
 for the future series apart from that not 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.290
 It remains more to say that the message of 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.780
 Akira was certainly inspiring but 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:39.090
 It is worth noting that he indicated that dragon 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.220
 ball is not over yet which leads to 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.820
 think about maybe there will be a future 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.190
 series or future movies good guys 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:50.610
 here in Latin America we are accustomed 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.890
 buy pirated movies and how are they 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.690
 I mentioned in previous videos the only 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.670
 what can we do to take it to 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.340
 out this project of a possible new 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.800
 series would be buying the movie 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.870
 bluray original is due out in the 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.450
 first third of 2014 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.790
 akira toriyama the creator of dragon ball 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.820
 is recognized as a person who 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:14.100
 almost never speaks to cameras or accepts 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:17.220
 interviews or that you release news to 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:19.440
 networks now leaves us a message saying 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.020
 Dragon Ball has not yet ended 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.360
 me this means a lot there is no that 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.580
 defraud I know that the sagas that you 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.860
 they commented are not real then in this 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.440
 Akira Toriyama case is really if 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.889
 said something about this good guys like that 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.259
 finished the video 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:37.719
