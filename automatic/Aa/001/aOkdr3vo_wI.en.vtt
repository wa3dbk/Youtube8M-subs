really a John so John does the one deck

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.069 
really a John so John does the one deck
I<00:02:10.649> see<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:11.190> really<00:02:11.579> benefits<00:02:11.880> quite<00:02:12.570> great

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:13.079 
I see that really benefits quite great

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:15.680 
I see that really benefits quite great
greatly<00:02:13.620> from<00:02:13.890> verdant<00:02:14.489> catacombs<00:02:14.600> but<00:02:15.600> the

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
greatly from verdant catacombs but the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.740 
greatly from verdant catacombs but the
other<00:02:15.870> decks<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.410> see<00:02:16.650> out<00:02:16.890> there<00:02:17.510> you<00:02:18.510> know<00:02:18.569> the

other decks I see out there you know the

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.920 
other decks I see out there you know the
difference<00:02:19.020> between<00:02:19.110> an<00:02:19.410> arid<00:02:19.709> mesa<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:20.370> they

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
difference between an arid mesa and they

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.259

then<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.049> black<00:02:22.230> red<00:02:22.500> one<00:02:22.680> not<00:02:23.250> all<00:02:23.580> that<00:02:23.939> much

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
then the black red one not all that much

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.990 
then the black red one not all that much
for<00:02:24.780> that<00:02:24.930> type<00:02:25.140> of<00:02:25.170> aggro<00:02:25.680> deck<00:02:25.950> so<00:02:26.579> I<00:02:26.610> would

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
for that type of aggro deck so I would

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.800 
for that type of aggro deck so I would
say<00:02:27.030> that<00:02:27.599> if<00:02:28.049> you<00:02:28.079> wanted<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.709> be<00:02:29.659> if<00:02:30.659> you

the price would be a little lower etc
etc<00:02:47.489> all<00:02:48.090> rotations<00:02:48.720> going<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.349> lower<00:02:49.500> the

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
etc all rotations going to lower the

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.080 
etc all rotations going to lower the

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
price yeah that might be true but not I

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.610 
price yeah that might be true but not I
would<00:02:54.090> much<00:02:54.269> rather<00:02:54.329> be<00:02:54.780> in<00:02:54.930> a<00:02:55.019> place<00:02:55.319> where<00:02:55.560> i

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
would much rather be in a place where i

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.800 
would much rather be in a place where i
had<00:02:55.950> lambs<00:02:56.310> then<00:02:56.730> didn't<00:02:57.180> have<00:02:57.299> the<00:02:57.450> land<00:02:57.629> i

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
had lambs then didn't have the land i

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.599 
had lambs then didn't have the land i
paid<00:02:58.079> a<00:02:58.109> little<00:02:58.349> more<00:02:58.440> for<00:02:58.829> them<00:02:58.950> because<00:02:59.159> once

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
paid a little more for them because once

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.240 
paid a little more for them because once
you<00:02:59.940> start<00:03:00.900> looking<00:03:01.139> for<00:03:01.530> them<00:03:01.620> like<00:03:01.950> the

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
you start looking for them like the

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.119 
you start looking for them like the
zendikar<00:03:02.790> enemy<00:03:03.299> lands<00:03:03.569> right<00:03:03.810> now<00:03:04.129> it

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
zendikar enemy lands right now it

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.270 
zendikar enemy lands right now it
becomes<00:03:05.400> a<00:03:05.930> very<00:03:06.930> big<00:03:07.230> problem<00:03:07.379> so<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:07.950> would

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
becomes a very big problem so I would

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.430 
becomes a very big problem so I would
say<00:03:08.310> stay<00:03:08.909> far<00:03:09.359> away<00:03:09.510> from<00:03:09.629> the<00:03:09.930> enemy<00:03:10.079> fetch

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
say stay far away from the enemy fetch

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.240 
say stay far away from the enemy fetch
lands<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:11.220> price<00:03:11.489> is<00:03:11.730> not<00:03:12.799> it's<00:03:13.799> not<00:03:13.950> a<00:03:14.010> good

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
lands the price is not it's not a good

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.190 
lands the price is not it's not a good
price<00:03:14.489> and<00:03:14.790> to<00:03:15.209> be<00:03:15.329> quite<00:03:15.420> honest<00:03:15.840> review<00:03:16.019> it's

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
price and to be quite honest review it's

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.680 
price and to be quite honest review it's
a<00:03:16.319> terrible<00:03:16.769> price<00:03:16.980> right<00:03:17.310> now<00:03:17.340> is<00:03:17.670> a<00:03:18.090> terrible

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
a terrible price right now is a terrible

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.890 
a terrible price right now is a terrible
time<00:03:18.870> you<00:03:19.079> buy<00:03:19.349> them<00:03:19.639> and<00:03:20.639> especially<00:03:21.299> if<00:03:21.780> you

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
time you buy them and especially if you

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.569 
time you buy them and especially if you
are<00:03:21.959> a<00:03:22.019> player<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:22.650> you<00:03:22.769> not<00:03:23.129> you<00:03:23.310> have<00:03:23.430> no

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
are a player and you not you have no

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.129 
are a player and you not you have no
intention<00:03:24.000> of<00:03:24.060> making<00:03:24.209> money<00:03:24.540> from<00:03:24.750> them<00:03:24.959> yeah

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
intention of making money from them yeah

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:26.420 
intention of making money from them yeah
you<00:03:25.230> can<00:03:25.410> buy<00:03:25.530> them<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:25.889> sell<00:03:26.099> them<00:03:26.129> higher

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
you can buy them and sell them higher

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.539 
you can buy them and sell them higher
but<00:03:27.260> what<00:03:28.260> if<00:03:28.500> you're<00:03:28.709> a<00:03:28.739> player<00:03:29.040> maybe<00:03:29.340> you

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
but what if you're a player maybe you

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.400 
but what if you're a player maybe you
just<00:03:29.669> want<00:03:29.910> them<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.150> play<00:03:30.329> with<00:03:30.599> so<00:03:31.139> I<00:03:31.169> would

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
just want them to play with so I would

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.140 
just want them to play with so I would
say<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.799> solution<00:03:32.040> is<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:33.060> make<00:03:33.329> decks<00:03:33.690> or<00:03:34.019> to

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
say the solution is to make decks or to

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.500 
say the solution is to make decks or to
use<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.870> onslaught<00:03:37.349> fetch<00:03:37.560> lands<00:03:38.030> rd<00:03:39.030> I<00:03:39.269> guess

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
use the onslaught fetch lands rd I guess

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.720 
use the onslaught fetch lands rd I guess
concert<00:03:40.019> or<00:03:40.199> cares<00:03:40.500> effects<00:03:41.010> lands<00:03:41.250> and<00:03:41.519> that

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
concert or cares effects lands and that

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.789 
concert or cares effects lands and that
should<00:03:42.030> solve<00:03:42.239> most<00:03:42.510> of<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.780> problem<00:03:43.139> and<00:03:43.319> I

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
should solve most of the problem and I

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.979 
should solve most of the problem and I
really<00:03:44.129> do<00:03:44.430> feel<00:03:44.459> like<00:03:44.879> that<00:03:45.120> is<00:03:45.480> a<00:03:45.510> valid

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
really do feel like that is a valid

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.869 
really do feel like that is a valid
solution<00:03:46.349> through<00:03:46.949> this<00:03:47.069> problem<00:03:47.519> of<00:03:47.699> these

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
solution through this problem of these

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:49.670 
solution through this problem of these
end<00:03:48.060> and<00:03:48.239> then<00:03:48.389> zencart<00:03:48.720> enemy<00:03:49.049> vessel<00:03:49.319> is<00:03:49.470> not
