00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.929
 the investigation revealed us tighten is dedication 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:27.679
 are part of teachers' daily life and that the universalization of teaching 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:32.599
 changed the life inside the schools as a teacher he looks beautiful 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:33.370
 Teresina 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.730
 to bring knowledge 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.410
 now what the Alagoan people 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.490
 only one 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.490
 and in accordance with the interests of each 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.340
 Today's class has as its theme the political-pedagogical project 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.140
 after mass is the people 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.150
 now it's time to review everything 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.480
 the maternal grandmother's house 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.600
 mathematics 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.600
 now is wait 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.649
 I think reading our school 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:07.790
 here all phases 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.790
 This yes or do not imagine the pay TV market 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.230
 if all the schools the parents also if they did this I believe that everything will be 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.670
 very old and also the political-pedagogical project he must have 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.660
 a philosophy of formation 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.630
 the event as battles 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.390
 political-pedagogical project 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.910
 it is an intention 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.980
 in my point of view 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.950
 he means 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.229
 articulate 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.480
 the school work 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.050
 someway 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.050
 feasible in a way that everyone 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.320
 Use today to understand what the school has to do 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.540
 he fulfilled his role 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.540
 was looking for meaning of pedagogical political project 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.140
 I entered the platform lattes 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.750
 a database of curricula institutions in the areas of science and 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:02.679
 technology 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:04.920
 available on the internet 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.310
 I found the name of the teacher maria lina alves doctor in education by 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.379
 unicamp 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.180
 watch again what she said about the political pedagogical project ppp 

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:17.859
 it was bad 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:19.150
 articulate 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.389
 the school work 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:22.969
 someway 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:25.969
 feasible in a way that everyone 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.229
 Use today to understand what the school has to do 

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:34.099
 he fulfilled his role 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.099
 what school has to do to fulfill its role 

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:39.200
 I remembered that in the text 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.879
 relationship school society new answers to an old problem 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:48.280
 antónio new alert here rethinking the school today is to bring to the 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.790
 If the families are lost, the school can not 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.550
 worry only 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.240
 in looking at the sky a month or that group that is inside it if the community 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:06.840
 not read what projects the pit is putting in the school goals so that the 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.609
 community to become a user of writing 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:11.970
 several times 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.390
 the viaduct was to refer to the educator paulo freire to explain the project 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.879
 political-pedagogical 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:21.269
 every time i paulo freire was invited 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.080
 to participate in a revolutionary project he said so 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.950
 from now on all who can read and write are teachers 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.470
 people have to help spread the word about 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.459
 population 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.749

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.999

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:00.779
 the image in the note 

00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:04.089
 the kingston 

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:07.089
 here is a book 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:10.879
 in a text 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:16.079

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.079

 Why is he a person here? 

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:42.949

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.979
 and the political-pedagogical project 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:50.199
 It's something that we're going to do. 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:51.270
 in a future 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.980
 Professor Michelle is keen to make it clear 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.360
 that this future team the frei refers to 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.379
 It's close 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:01.540
 the political-pedagogical project he must have 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.029

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:58.909
 I enjoyed that I was practically on the side and went to são Carlos 

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:01.139
