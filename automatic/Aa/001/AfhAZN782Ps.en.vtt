00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.000
 Westerners on the other side of the world 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.279

 Western that most of us know 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.890
 the eastern dragons are described 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.600
 as creatures that could measure between 1 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.640

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.940
 to those of a unicorn and big eyes of 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.860
 lobster but not only that unlike 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.930
 of the Western dragons the 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.199
 orientals are known as beings 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.570

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.750
 divine treasure shields 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.910
 even though the eastern dragons 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.010
 they were mostly peaceful or they seem 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.930
 that are just weak creatures the truth 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.390
 is that they had magical abilities 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.460
 between them they could change shape and 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.350
 be it becoming an animal or even 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.750
 even in a human in addition also

 they could fly without having wings 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.410
 And they could do it at speeds 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.450
 impressive taking advantage of 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.400

 even on certain occasions they could 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.340
 influence the lives of humans either 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.530
 for good or for bad it depends on the 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.360
 person who speaks and his actions but 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.430
 despite this the Chinese dragons the 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.649
 most of the time they gave luck to 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.869

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.840
 being the rabbit overrun by the rat
