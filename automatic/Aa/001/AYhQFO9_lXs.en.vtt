00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:15.360
 hello girls like hello girls between 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:20.220
 girls are looking for a compromise 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.810
 terms but the spring in a rigid hand 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.830
 girl is welcome in this new one 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.730
 video then today i want to make you 1 mega 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:34.710
 super super make up dam and me 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:38.670
 we did make up by hello but 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.969
 simply because I always have with 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.460
 feathers every day but every week 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.200
 something I buy it even though I 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.360
 I buy 200 things all at once 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.090
 against a little bit a little bit 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.510
 and then he started using things for her 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.969
 which then do not do them in the end why 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.760
 I don't like to show myself to record 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.680
 don't show you things I've used 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.680
 if it were used, they see that it can not 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.350
 throw the little ugly so in the end 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.390
 I never do all my cups because 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.130
 then I tell myself they still show everything 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.680
 what I bought for the boys 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.930
 during the makeup tutorial this case 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.189
 but it is nothing that I absolutely owe you 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:23.250
 do because I received things from 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.280
 of dancing and I get so many things 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.450
 beautiful that when you raised the 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.900
 pack 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.869
 I the first thing I thought is either mine 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.840
 god there would be a mistake in the hand there 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.369
 I was speechless because of me 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.979
 therefore they have a longing for what 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.880
 now I muck my mouth and I'll do it 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.560
 see what was sent to me 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.570
 then the first thing he showed him are 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.470
 two blush I received two 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:56.520
 the caban boy and down boyd arms 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.590
 campano boy is the beautiful color 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.780
 I had been looking for a blush for a long time 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.100
 of this color I had spotted one 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.259
 of the 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.570
 I was almost as similar and you the father of 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.880
 buy it but now I received this 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.600
 I do not believe that I will buy that of 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:14.510
 meters and the other by you instead is 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.819
 always a pink blush but in this case it is 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.790
 a blush opaque yes I think it's a blush 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.350
 always dull them cold but much more 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.900
 clear so if you have a skin 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.610
 I particularly recommend you 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.400
 this is not the other because another 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.920
 it may be a little too dark 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.550
 for too-too-light skins 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.670
 then the boat was sent but mother and 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:41.150
 this I wanted to try girls from 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:44.810
 very much and it is this blog does not have 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.480
 threw the only thing cold enough 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.900
 I hope it's not too dark for me but 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.459
 I don't think it's because I saw it used 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.500
 from so many girls who are 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:03:00.200
 very clear of skin and does not make an effect 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.569
 stained so I hope that to me too 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:07.370
 I can go can go well 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:11.570
 then there is the like that similar managers and 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:16.820
 the mary numan heiser the menu never riser 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:23.799
 he he he he illuminating all 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:28.340
 effects on the tone of the video and the gilded 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:32.480
 but those things here are not gold chan 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:36.530
 the illuminating ones turn on the golden but 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.650
 it's quite neutral this year 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.079
 very simple because I don't love 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.819
 golden lights too too strong 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.680
 I don't think they fit 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.799
 to me who has very light skin and then 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.560
 chelsea by roman heiser than in theory 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:56.889
 this too is born as illuminating for 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:04:00.379
 the darker skins but I find it 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:04.719
 perfect with very leathery melas 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:07.310
 clear turns to fishing and is 

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:10.040
 beautiful applied on the quotas because 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.680
 it gives this effect very very much 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:19.280
 bright is not too colorful too 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:21.829
 so it's like it's a blush and a 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.099
 that is, not just face brightness 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:27.289
 artificial then something I like 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:29.509
 very much and then they sent me three 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:30.919
 I wanted when I saw them 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:34.310
 to die 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:37.630
 no don't be surprised the first is the 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:44.030
 meta mag news 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:46.370
 this palette and life too 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.960
 very curious palette to try it 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:52.729
 many bloggers youtubers and lobbyist 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:56.330
 the girl who really made me mine 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:59.780
 want to have it is that the list of will 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:03.409
 make up 01 that has it often happens to me 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:07.030
 to see her during her videos came 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:09.740
 really want to try it and I am 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:12.470
 delighted to be able to try to point 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:18.370
 for those who don't know practically one 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:19.580
 palette of nine colors all opaque and 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.370
 news 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.470
 so it's all a palette that tends to 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.870
 mine of subcultures minutes but they are all 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.419
 quite neutral values 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:34.729
 there are browns there are grays 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:36.009
 white the yellow all the colors to whom 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:39.759
 they go 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:42.669
 great to create a trick is me 

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:45.789
 always sent on the subject of new 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:49.180
 of the new d'etude also this year 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:53.619
 very curious to try it honestly 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:56.409
 me less than the meta mit matmut but a 

00:05:53.619 --> 00:06:01.180
 this must be as rigorous as I have seen it 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:04.089
 I was left speechless 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:07.629
 this compared to the other in more colors 

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:09.999
 strong so you can play a little 

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:10.800
 more then one feeding boys and 

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:17.199
 scares 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:20.499
 I myself mind passing the Latin 

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:26.499
 they are almost creamy really big 

00:06:20.499 --> 00:06:29.979
 beautiful and then last last palette last 

00:06:26.499 --> 00:06:30.969
 what was sent to me is the band 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:33.249
 giovi 

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:36.459
 also this year to tighten a lot 

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:38.289
 and I wanted to try it and it's beautiful 

00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:40.389
 it's like that inside 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:44.409
 there is a heart-shaped mirror then 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:46.599
 there is the palette I am below with 

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:50.110
 colors 

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:51.789
 there is also an illuminant and a blush e 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:54.849
 these names say it is a thing 

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:58.930
 fantastic and then another one opens 

00:06:54.849 --> 00:07:01.689
 part and there are two products inside 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:03.459

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:05.999
 this is a lot of fun for schio 

00:07:03.459 --> 00:07:08.469

00:07:05.999 --> 00:07:11.550
