00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.890
 Do you know the cause of Hyodong Prize in Korea 1st place 2nd 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:12.420
 It is not a booklet of the warden. 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:16.350
 24 years of highway death cause of accident such a drowsiness driving 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.279
 But now the Nexus is going to be able to reshape the former Sabo. 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.310
 I will 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.310
 U 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.800
 Drowsy driving accidents in the country 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:33.890
 Literally causing sleepiness is 0 jagoro that leads to death 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:36.490
 The ridicule for the driver is a time bomb that does not know when it will lead to a big accident 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.490
 It can be said 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:47.480
 As well as drunk driving, not only the money that is wrong , 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:52.310
 It can be two days, and the importance of prevention is more emphasized. 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:57.620
 I've been looking for a new burn that prevents this drowsy driving . 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:01:01.550
 Hello. Yes. I think I installed Simplex . 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.600
 I heard you had a special black box, so I came to ask you one time. 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.620
 What is it 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:10.280
 If our black box lies on the driver and leaves the lane indiscriminately, 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.300
 The lane departure alarm function will be installed where the hostage hosted the hostage. 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.280
 It's a black box. 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.540
 5 Areas box Trang also geureongeot example I can think another column reporting directly once the experiment 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.630
 I can do it. 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.630
 Yes 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.360
 U 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:33.250
 If the graduation is before, it will alert you if you leave the lane for driving and time 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:40.440
 It gives a seashell'll check the lane departure warning system directly harassment 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:40.440
 5 First , I will make intentional lane departure during normal driving. 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:50.880
 When it is working well for the people who built leg guides 2 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:55.500
 Go to # incha open as soon as the health insurance on color while right turns red 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.030
 I look for the right wear again, guide the guide and gag, holding the alarm sound 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.010
 Turns off 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:05.310
 If the blinking is on and the lane is changed normally, the alarm will not sound 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:11.090
 If you suddenly change the lane without turning on the flicker 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:15.230
 The alarm will sound without a room or what I thought Boso Lure 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:20.480
 One day before the drowsy driving, 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:25.760
 Have you changed bone ah companies like traditional baseball 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:31.849
 As a long-distance driving or put on those risks before you sleepy such that a sphere 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:37.099
 It's a turn for everyone, but I do not want the novice driver to need the world. 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:42.620
 Now the driver in the dream lane is not good for the distance of the pros 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:45.349
 Because now, for example, opened through the same point that now some of the gap with Samsung 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:50.299
 I feel I can make it clearer. 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:54.950
 Now that Blackbox has the ability to help process after the accident, 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:03:01.250
 Room 31 in advance, I could do that, why can march its 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:05.660
 In addition, if you have a flux that automatically identifies signs on the road 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.910
 Imagine moving objects, such as cars or people, 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:12.659
 Up to the flap bus 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:16.680
 Various technologies have been developed to prevent accidents in advance 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:17.909
 The risk of various accidents can be greatly reduced even in this one- dimensional tax cut technique. 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:23.150
 That 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:23.150
 I think that's why black boxes are getting better and better.
