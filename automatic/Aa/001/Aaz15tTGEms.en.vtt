the<00:00:11.219> L<00:00:11.340> for<00:00:11.550> grasshopper<00:00:12.240> it's<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.870> fairly

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
the L for grasshopper it's a fairly

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.839 
the L for grasshopper it's a fairly
large<00:00:13.290> aircraft<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:14.009> has<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.219> wingspan<00:00:14.429> that

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849
