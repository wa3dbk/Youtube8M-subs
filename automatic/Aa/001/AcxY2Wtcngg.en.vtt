it I just wanted to play chess I need to
anytime<00:00:48.700> you<00:00:48.850> have<00:00:48.910> white<00:00:49.120> against<00:00:49.360> a<00:00:49.450> lower

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:49.630 
anytime you have white against a lower

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.600 
anytime you have white against a lower
rated<00:00:49.989> player<00:00:50.200> you<00:00:50.560> really<00:00:51.040> want<00:00:51.220> to<00:00:51.310> try<00:00:51.489> and

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
rated player you really want to try and

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.750 
rated player you really want to try and
put<00:00:51.790> some<00:00:51.940> pressure<00:00:52.060> on<00:00:52.420> them<00:00:52.660> and<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.980> sure<00:00:54.730> a

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
put some pressure on them and so sure a

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.920 
put some pressure on them and so sure a
draw<00:00:55.090> would<00:00:55.270> have<00:00:55.360> been<00:00:55.480> nice<00:00:55.660> for<00:00:55.690> the

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
draw would have been nice for the

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.220 
draw would have been nice for the
tournament<00:00:56.350> situation<00:00:56.500> but<00:00:57.989> unlike<00:00:58.989> say<00:00:59.200> a

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
tournament situation but unlike say a

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.900 
tournament situation but unlike say a
tournament<00:00:59.649> such<00:00:59.890> as<00:01:00.040> vikon's<00:01:00.460> a<00:01:00.640> for

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
tournament such as vikon's a for

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.479 
tournament such as vikon's a for
instance<00:01:01.030> there<00:01:01.660> it's<00:01:01.930> not<00:01:02.470> quite<00:01:03.190> as

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
instance there it's not quite as

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.520 
instance there it's not quite as
prestigious<00:01:04.420> there<00:01:04.720> isn't<00:01:04.960> as<00:01:05.049> much<00:01:05.229> on<00:01:05.409> the

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
prestigious there isn't as much on the

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.190 
prestigious there isn't as much on the
line<00:01:05.710> so<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:07.240> know<00:01:07.329> if<00:01:07.450> I<00:01:07.540> spike<00:01:07.780> Sergey<00:01:08.140> in

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
line so you know if I spike Sergey in

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.319 
line so you know if I spike Sergey in
the<00:01:08.290> last<00:01:08.500> round<00:01:08.649> of<00:01:08.799> icons<00:01:09.100> a<00:01:09.280> I<00:01:09.430> might<00:01:09.700> be

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:10.329 
the last round of icons a I might be

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:12.990 
the last round of icons a I might be
more<00:01:10.630> open<00:01:11.049> to<00:01:11.079> taking<00:01:11.500> a<00:01:11.619> quick<00:01:12.009> draw<00:01:12.280> but<00:01:12.700> in

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
more open to taking a quick draw but in

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.609 
more open to taking a quick draw but in
this<00:01:13.270> situation<00:01:13.540> it<00:01:14.049> was<00:01:14.170> such<00:01:14.320> a<00:01:14.350> short

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
this situation it was such a short

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:16.859 
this situation it was such a short
tournament<00:01:15.250> and<00:01:15.399> having<00:01:16.329> had<00:01:16.570> such<00:01:16.840> a

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
tournament and having had such a

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:19.559

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
felt like I had to really take my

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:23.580

yesterday's game against who where I was
substantially<00:01:28.420> worse<00:01:28.649> after<00:01:29.649> I<00:01:29.679> missed<00:01:29.950> a

00:01:30.059 --> 00:01:30.069 
substantially worse after I missed a

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:31.980 
substantially worse after I missed a
little<00:01:30.429> combination<00:01:31.209> that<00:01:31.569> she<00:01:31.719> came<00:01:31.840> up<00:01:31.959> with

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
little combination that she came up with

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.260 
little combination that she came up with
him<00:01:32.229> in<00:01:32.380> the<00:01:32.709> middle<00:01:32.889> game<00:01:33.130> was<00:01:33.700> Queen<00:01:33.909> I<00:01:33.939> have

an idea

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.749 
an idea
outside<00:01:35.799> of<00:01:35.829> that<00:01:36.069> game<00:01:36.279> though<00:01:36.429> I<00:01:36.459> felt

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
outside of that game though I felt

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:38.429 
outside of that game though I felt
overall<00:01:37.209> I<00:01:37.240> was<00:01:37.420> in<00:01:37.539> control<00:01:37.840> and<00:01:38.109> most<00:01:38.229> of<00:01:38.380> the

round<00:01:49.270> so<00:01:49.389> it<00:01:49.450> was<00:01:49.539> a<00:01:49.569> very<00:01:49.719> long<00:01:49.990> tactical

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
round so it was a very long tactical

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.459 
round so it was a very long tactical
grind<00:01:51.599> actually<00:01:52.599> very<00:01:52.810> similar<00:01:53.049> to<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.289> game

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469 
grind actually very similar to the game

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:54.719 
grind actually very similar to the game
I<00:01:53.590> played<00:01:53.799> against<00:01:54.009> them<00:01:54.130> in<00:01:54.279> London<00:01:54.369> but

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
I played against them in London but

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.379 
I played against them in London but
nevertheless<00:01:54.999> anytime<00:01:55.749> you<00:01:56.529> can<00:01:57.310> be<00:01:57.459> 2700

00:01:58.379 --> 00:01:58.389 
nevertheless anytime you can be 2700

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:00.330 
nevertheless anytime you can be 2700
player<00:01:58.599> it's<00:01:59.139> really<00:01:59.560> quite<00:01:59.740> nice<00:01:59.889> and<00:02:00.099> I<00:02:00.159> mean

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
player it's really quite nice and I mean

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.609 
player it's really quite nice and I mean
she<00:02:00.490> was<00:02:00.579> of<00:02:00.880> course<00:02:01.060> very<00:02:01.359> strong<00:02:01.659> to<00:02:01.929> I<00:02:02.139> was

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
she was of course very strong to I was

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:03.959 
she was of course very strong to I was
certainly<00:02:03.069> the<00:02:03.189> favor<00:02:03.429> going<00:02:03.759> into<00:02:03.909> the

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969 
certainly the favor going into the

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:07.589 
certainly the favor going into the
tournament<00:02:04.240> so<00:02:04.810> I<00:02:05.969> really<00:02:06.969> had<00:02:07.119> to<00:02:07.209> just<00:02:07.270> try

00:02:07.589 --> 00:02:07.599 
tournament so I really had to just try

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:09.719 
tournament so I really had to just try
my<00:02:07.779> best<00:02:07.990> and<00:02:08.410> that's<00:02:08.860> really<00:02:09.099> all<00:02:09.280> you<00:02:09.429> can<00:02:09.580> do

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
my best and that's really all you can do

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.280 
my best and that's really all you can do
is<00:02:09.849> just<00:02:09.970> put<00:02:10.209> pressure<00:02:10.479> on<00:02:10.690> your<00:02:10.840> opponents

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
is just put pressure on your opponents

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.990 
is just put pressure on your opponents
and<00:02:11.440> hope<00:02:12.130> that<00:02:12.310> they<00:02:12.430> crack<00:02:12.670> under<00:02:12.970> the

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
and hope that they crack under the

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.110 
and hope that they crack under the
pressure<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:14.370> certainly<00:02:15.370> once<00:02:15.730> I<00:02:15.819> beat<00:02:16.000> on

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
pressure and certainly once I beat on

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.550 
pressure and certainly once I beat on
you<00:02:16.270> in<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.510> first<00:02:16.750> round<00:02:17.020> it<00:02:17.140> made<00:02:17.260> things<00:02:17.470> a

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
you in the first round it made things a

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.500 
you in the first round it made things a
lot<00:02:17.709> easier<00:02:17.739> because<00:02:18.400> he<00:02:18.489> because<00:02:18.910> I<00:02:19.000> assumed

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
lot easier because he because I assumed

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.040 
lot easier because he because I assumed
at<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:19.750> start<00:02:19.989> who'd<00:02:20.170> be<00:02:20.290> my<00:02:20.440> main

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
at the start who'd be my main

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.010 
at the start who'd be my main
competitor<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:22.520> so<00:02:22.790> anytime<00:02:23.300> you<00:02:23.600> can<00:02:23.720> start

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
competitor and so anytime you can start

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.630 
competitor and so anytime you can start
off<00:02:24.110> with<00:02:24.140> a<00:02:24.290> win<00:02:24.440> against<00:02:24.800> your<00:02:25.040> your<00:02:25.280> main

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
off with a win against your your main

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.030 
off with a win against your your main
rival<00:02:26.120> it<00:02:26.480> makes<00:02:27.020> the<00:02:27.140> job<00:02:27.290> a<00:02:27.350> lot<00:02:27.530> easier<00:02:27.590> and

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
rival it makes the job a lot easier and

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.370 
rival it makes the job a lot easier and
so<00:02:28.220> good<00:02:29.000> good<00:02:29.390> starts<00:02:29.720> I<00:02:29.900> guess<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.170> moral

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
so good good starts I guess the moral

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.690 
so good good starts I guess the moral
stories<00:02:30.800> that<00:02:30.950> good<00:02:31.100> starts<00:02:31.430> are<00:02:31.520> very

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
stories that good starts are very

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.910 
stories that good starts are very
important<00:02:32.300> and<00:02:32.540> I<00:02:32.840> just<00:02:33.590> happened<00:02:33.770> to<00:02:33.800> be<00:02:33.860> a

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
important and I just happened to be a

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.530 
important and I just happened to be a
Turin<00:02:34.190> where<00:02:34.310> I<00:02:34.340> got<00:02:34.520> to<00:02:34.790> a<00:02:34.820> good<00:02:35.000> start<00:02:35.300> and

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
Turin where I got to a good start and

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.180 
Turin where I got to a good start and
luckily<00:02:36.410> it<00:02:36.500> was<00:02:36.590> short<00:02:36.830> enough<00:02:36.860> that<00:02:37.040> I

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
luckily it was short enough that I

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.440 
luckily it was short enough that I
didn't<00:02:37.430> have<00:02:37.550> time<00:02:37.730> enough<00:02:38.000> time<00:02:38.180> to<00:02:38.300> lose

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
didn't have time enough time to lose

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.550 
didn't have time enough time to lose
four<00:02:38.720> games<00:02:38.750> in<00:02:39.050> a<00:02:39.140> row<00:02:39.790> in<00:02:40.790> London<00:02:41.150> really

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
four games in a row in London really

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.560 
four games in a row in London really
things<00:02:42.560> just<00:02:42.800> didn't<00:02:43.040> didn't<00:02:43.550> go<00:02:43.730> well<00:02:44.240> for<00:02:44.480> me

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
things just didn't didn't go well for me

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.660 
things just didn't didn't go well for me
I<00:02:44.600> mean<00:02:44.870> I<00:02:44.930> missed<00:02:45.170> a<00:02:45.230> couple<00:02:45.670> key

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
I mean I missed a couple key

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.010 
I mean I missed a couple key
opportunities<00:02:47.180> early<00:02:47.480> on<00:02:47.600> in<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.840> tournament

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
opportunities early on in the tournament

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.440 
opportunities early on in the tournament
I<00:02:48.380> think<00:02:48.410> from<00:02:49.340> that<00:02:49.460> moment<00:02:49.640> on<00:02:49.880> it's<00:02:50.090> you

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
I think from that moment on it's you

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.990 
I think from that moment on it's you
know<00:02:50.680> in<00:02:51.680> long<00:02:51.890> tournaments<00:02:52.520> more<00:02:52.700> so<00:02:52.850> than

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
know in long tournaments more so than

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.280 
know in long tournaments more so than
short<00:02:53.240> ones<00:02:53.480> here<00:02:53.660> you're<00:02:53.870> gonna<00:02:53.960> get<00:02:54.140> your

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
short ones here you're gonna get your

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.470 
short ones here you're gonna get your
mix<00:02:54.530> of<00:02:54.710> opportunities<00:02:55.700> to<00:02:55.730> win<00:02:56.060> and<00:02:56.270> then

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
mix of opportunities to win and then

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.850 
mix of opportunities to win and then
you're<00:02:56.600> also<00:02:56.750> gonna<00:02:56.900> have<00:02:57.050> games<00:02:57.650> where

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
you're also gonna have games where

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:58.930 
you're also gonna have games where
you're<00:02:58.010> you're<00:02:58.310> in<00:02:58.430> trouble<00:02:58.640> and<00:02:58.790> you're

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
you're you're in trouble and you're

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.940 
you're you're in trouble and you're
having<00:02:59.090> to<00:02:59.240> defend<00:02:59.540> and<00:03:00.020> once<00:03:00.770> the

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
having to defend and once the

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.520 
having to defend and once the
opportunities<00:03:01.850> went<00:03:02.060> away<00:03:02.150> then<00:03:02.540> I<00:03:02.660> then<00:03:03.110> like

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
opportunities went away then I then like

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.410 
opportunities went away then I then like
all<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:04.130> luck<00:03:04.310> started<00:03:04.610> bouncing<00:03:05.030> out<00:03:05.180> and

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
all the luck started bouncing out and

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.600 
all the luck started bouncing out and
then<00:03:05.540> became<00:03:05.990> a<00:03:06.250> difficult<00:03:07.250> time<00:03:07.370> and<00:03:07.520> I

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
then became a difficult time and I

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.070 
then became a difficult time and I
really<00:03:07.820> just<00:03:07.940> kind<00:03:08.180> of<00:03:08.330> just<00:03:08.750> lost

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
really just kind of just lost

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.940 
really just kind of just lost
perspective<00:03:09.740> for<00:03:10.160> a<00:03:10.190> few<00:03:10.340> games<00:03:10.580> but<00:03:11.090> I<00:03:11.950> guess

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
perspective for a few games but I guess

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.950 
perspective for a few games but I guess
I<00:03:13.340> guess<00:03:13.550> the<00:03:13.670> main<00:03:13.790> thing<00:03:13.850> that<00:03:14.420> I'll<00:03:14.660> take

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960 
I guess the main thing that I'll take

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.510 
I guess the main thing that I'll take
away<00:03:15.020> from<00:03:15.410> you<00:03:15.680> know<00:03:15.770> everything's<00:03:16.160> happened

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
away from you know everything's happened

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.670 
away from you know everything's happened
is<00:03:16.610> just<00:03:16.700> you<00:03:17.210> know<00:03:17.240> you<00:03:18.170> have<00:03:18.320> to<00:03:18.440> be<00:03:18.530> more

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
is just you know you have to be more

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.530 
is just you know you have to be more
consistent<00:03:19.010> you<00:03:19.220> have<00:03:19.310> to<00:03:19.430> really<00:03:20.000> stop<00:03:20.360> the

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
consistent you have to really stop the

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.180 
consistent you have to really stop the
bleeding<00:03:20.960> one<00:03:21.260> when<00:03:21.530> things<00:03:21.740> aren't<00:03:22.070> going

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
bleeding one when things aren't going

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.390 
bleeding one when things aren't going
your<00:03:22.370> way<00:03:22.520> and<00:03:22.640> I<00:03:22.910> just<00:03:23.180> kind<00:03:23.420> of<00:03:23.510> didn't<00:03:24.500> I

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
your way and I just kind of didn't I

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.940 
your way and I just kind of didn't I
wasn't<00:03:26.050> pragmatic<00:03:27.050> or<00:03:27.200> practical<00:03:27.260> about<00:03:27.800> the

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
wasn't pragmatic or practical about the

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.740 
wasn't pragmatic or practical about the
situation<00:03:28.550> and<00:03:28.790> because<00:03:29.210> of<00:03:29.240> that<00:03:29.300> you<00:03:29.630> know

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
situation and because of that you know

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.580 
situation and because of that you know
it<00:03:30.530> cost<00:03:30.920> me<00:03:31.130> but<00:03:31.340> still<00:03:32.140> not<00:03:33.140> the<00:03:33.200> end<00:03:33.320> of<00:03:33.470> the

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
it cost me but still not the end of the

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.810 
it cost me but still not the end of the
world<00:03:33.770> there<00:03:34.010> are<00:03:34.040> there<00:03:34.250> more<00:03:34.430> tournaments

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
world there are there more tournaments

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.670 
world there are there more tournaments
I'm<00:03:35.210> gonna<00:03:35.600> be<00:03:35.720> not<00:03:35.870> my<00:03:36.080> opportunities

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
I'm gonna be not my opportunities

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.980 
I'm gonna be not my opportunities
against<00:03:36.920> the<00:03:37.130> top<00:03:37.280> players<00:03:37.580> again<00:03:37.880> and<00:03:38.180> you

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:38.990 
against the top players again and you

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.360 
against the top players again and you
know<00:03:39.050> it's<00:03:39.200> in<00:03:39.320> the<00:03:39.380> past<00:03:39.440> now<00:03:39.860> so<00:03:40.070> I<00:03:40.100> just<00:03:40.130> have

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
know it's in the past now so I just have

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.490 
know it's in the past now so I just have
to<00:03:40.460> look<00:03:40.610> forward<00:03:40.850> to<00:03:41.000> the<00:03:41.060> next<00:03:41.210> event<00:03:41.420> I<00:03:41.810> mean

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
to look forward to the next event I mean

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.930 
to look forward to the next event I mean
I<00:03:42.560> think<00:03:42.650> for<00:03:42.950> me<00:03:43.070> really<00:03:43.280> it's<00:03:43.520> just<00:03:43.580> that<00:03:43.850> at

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
I think for me really it's just that at

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.240 
I think for me really it's just that at
some<00:03:44.150> point<00:03:44.180> it<00:03:44.540> stops<00:03:44.780> I<00:03:45.230> mean<00:03:45.590> you<00:03:45.950> want<00:03:46.130> to

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
some point it stops I mean you want to

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.060 
some point it stops I mean you want to
enjoy<00:03:46.340> chess<00:03:46.760> when<00:03:46.970> you're<00:03:47.090> playing<00:03:47.330> it<00:03:47.600> and

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
enjoy chess when you're playing it and

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.140 
enjoy chess when you're playing it and
especially<00:03:49.070> when<00:03:49.280> things<00:03:49.550> aren't<00:03:49.790> going<00:03:49.940> well

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
especially when things aren't going well

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.450 
especially when things aren't going well
and<00:03:51.140> you<00:03:51.560> know<00:03:51.650> this<00:03:51.890> is<00:03:51.950> probably<00:03:52.220> most

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.460 
and you know this is probably most

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.370 
and you know this is probably most
difficult<00:03:52.880> aspect<00:03:53.330> of<00:03:53.420> being<00:03:53.480> a<00:03:53.780> professional

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
difficult aspect of being a professional

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.890 
difficult aspect of being a professional
player<00:03:54.620> is<00:03:54.800> that<00:03:55.070> any<00:03:55.670> time<00:03:56.000> you<00:03:56.360> lose<00:03:56.540> a<00:03:56.600> game

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
player is that any time you lose a game

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.690 
player is that any time you lose a game
for<00:03:57.620> the<00:03:57.680> most<00:03:57.890> part<00:03:58.130> you<00:03:58.250> have<00:03:58.340> to<00:03:58.370> play<00:03:58.580> the

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
for the most part you have to play the

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.850 
for the most part you have to play the
following<00:03:58.880> day<00:03:59.270> and<00:03:59.600> when<00:04:00.500> things<00:04:00.710> aren't

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
following day and when things aren't

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.290 
following day and when things aren't
going<00:04:00.950> your<00:04:01.130> way<00:04:01.280> it's<00:04:01.520> very<00:04:01.730> hard<00:04:02.030> to<00:04:02.180> get

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
going your way it's very hard to get

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.220 
going your way it's very hard to get
motivated<00:04:02.840> or<00:04:03.110> excited<00:04:03.620> about<00:04:03.800> playing<00:04:04.100> chess

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
motivated or excited about playing chess

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.930 
motivated or excited about playing chess
you<00:04:06.230> know<00:04:06.350> through<00:04:06.620> the<00:04:06.710> following<00:04:07.040> day<00:04:07.640> and

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
you know through the following day and

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.560 
you know through the following day and
so<00:04:08.390> because<00:04:08.660> of<00:04:08.810> that<00:04:09.910> you<00:04:10.910> know<00:04:11.030> to<00:04:11.150> me<00:04:11.330> it<00:04:11.450> was

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
so because of that you know to me it was

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.120 
so because of that you know to me it was
just<00:04:11.750> a<00:04:11.870> matter<00:04:12.050> at<00:04:12.290> some<00:04:12.500> point<00:04:12.740> I<00:04:12.800> stopped

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
just a matter at some point I stopped

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.280 
just a matter at some point I stopped
caring<00:04:13.400> I<00:04:13.670> just<00:04:13.850> became<00:04:14.180> unmotivated<00:04:14.570> and

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
caring I just became unmotivated and

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.229 
caring I just became unmotivated and
when<00:04:15.920> you<00:04:16.040> when<00:04:16.310> you<00:04:16.400> aren't<00:04:16.549> excited<00:04:17.120> when

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
when you when you aren't excited when

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:18.789 
when you when you aren't excited when
you<00:04:17.270> aren't<00:04:17.480> motivated<00:04:17.660> to<00:04:18.049> play<00:04:18.200> chess<00:04:18.470> it's

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
you aren't motivated to play chess it's

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.409 
you aren't motivated to play chess it's
very<00:04:19.040> difficult<00:04:19.489> to<00:04:19.640> play<00:04:19.820> well

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.770 

I<00:04:23.919> still<00:04:24.919> play<00:04:25.159> occasionally<00:04:26.150> not<00:04:26.330> not<00:04:26.599> as

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
I still play occasionally not not as

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.670 
I still play occasionally not not as
much<00:04:26.990> anymore<00:04:27.199> simply<00:04:27.979> because<00:04:29.289> I'm<00:04:30.289> trying

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
much anymore simply because I'm trying

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.739 
much anymore simply because I'm trying
to<00:04:30.770> focus<00:04:31.039> more<00:04:31.639> on<00:04:31.699> classical<00:04:32.240> chess<00:04:32.509> and

00:04:32.739 --> 00:04:32.749 
to focus more on classical chess and

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:34.089 
to focus more on classical chess and
I've<00:04:32.840> found<00:04:33.139> the<00:04:33.259> big<00:04:33.439> difference<00:04:33.800> between

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:34.099 
I've found the big difference between

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:36.610 
I've found the big difference between
classical<00:04:34.460> and<00:04:35.060> blitz<00:04:35.689> or<00:04:35.960> bullet<00:04:36.349> for<00:04:36.499> that

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
classical and blitz or bullet for that

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.980 
classical and blitz or bullet for that
matter<00:04:36.830> is<00:04:37.129> that<00:04:37.159> your<00:04:38.090> play<00:04:38.330> is<00:04:38.360> a<00:04:38.539> lot<00:04:38.779> more

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
matter is that your play is a lot more

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.469 
matter is that your play is a lot more
superficial<00:04:39.740> online<00:04:40.129> you<00:04:40.370> you<00:04:40.550> calculating

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
superficial online you you calculating

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:43.480 
superficial online you you calculating
maybe<00:04:41.719> two<00:04:42.050> moves<00:04:42.319> deep<00:04:42.499> for<00:04:42.710> both<00:04:42.860> sides<00:04:43.159> and

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
maybe two moves deep for both sides and

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:44.980 
maybe two moves deep for both sides and
so<00:04:43.789> you're<00:04:43.969> just<00:04:44.150> really<00:04:44.330> calculating

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
so you're just really calculating

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.830 
so you're just really calculating
tactics<00:04:45.529> and<00:04:45.740> at<00:04:46.340> this<00:04:46.669> level<00:04:46.939> your<00:04:47.599> play<00:04:47.779> has

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
tactics and at this level your play has

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.420 
tactics and at this level your play has
to<00:04:47.930> be<00:04:48.020> very<00:04:48.229> sound<00:04:48.620> you<00:04:48.860> have<00:04:48.949> to<00:04:49.039> think<00:04:49.249> about

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
to be very sound you have to think about

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.249 
to be very sound you have to think about
long-term<00:04:49.789> plans<00:04:50.300> much<00:04:50.569> more<00:04:50.810> than<00:04:50.960> simply

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:51.259 
long-term plans much more than simply

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:53.080 
long-term plans much more than simply
the<00:04:51.919> next<00:04:52.159> two<00:04:52.279> or<00:04:52.400> three<00:04:52.430> moves<00:04:52.759> in<00:04:52.969> the<00:04:53.060> game

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
the next two or three moves in the game

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.269 
the next two or three moves in the game
and<00:04:53.509> because<00:04:53.719> of<00:04:53.840> that<00:04:54.020> that's<00:04:54.770> that's<00:04:55.069> really

00:04:55.269 --> 00:04:55.279 
and because of that that's that's really

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:56.800 
and because of that that's that's really
main<00:04:55.550> reason<00:04:55.879> I<00:04:55.939> stopped<00:04:56.210> playing<00:04:56.360> so<00:04:56.659> much

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
main reason I stopped playing so much

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.510 
main reason I stopped playing so much
not<00:04:57.080> too<00:04:57.229> much<00:04:57.379> and<00:04:57.620> they're<00:04:57.770> there<00:04:58.069> other

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
not too much and they're there other

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.950 
not too much and they're there other
players<00:04:58.849> who<00:04:59.000> I<00:04:59.060> think<00:04:59.270> are<00:04:59.360> just<00:04:59.569> much<00:04:59.779> better

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
players who I think are just much better

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.659 
players who I think are just much better
than<00:05:00.259> me<00:05:00.409> now<00:05:00.529> like<00:05:00.889> gand<00:05:01.129> Reagan<00:05:01.520> for

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
than me now like gand Reagan for

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.260

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
be strong competition and I just have to

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.209 
be strong competition and I just have to
try<00:05:16.669> and<00:05:16.729> do<00:05:17.419> better<00:05:17.629> than<00:05:17.900> I<00:05:17.990> did<00:05:18.050> last<00:05:18.500> time<00:05:19.099> I

00:05:19.209 --> 00:05:19.219 
try and do better than I did last time I

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:21.579 
try and do better than I did last time I
played<00:05:19.460> in<00:05:19.669> a<00:05:20.000> strong<00:05:20.240> tournament<00:05:20.750> like<00:05:21.379> that

00:05:21.579 --> 00:05:21.589 
played in a strong tournament like that

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:24.399 
played in a strong tournament like that
I<00:05:21.889> think<00:05:22.849> it's<00:05:22.969> it's<00:05:23.180> gonna<00:05:23.300> be<00:05:23.509> weird<00:05:23.749> to<00:05:24.080> come

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:24.409 
I think it's it's gonna be weird to come

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:26.320 
I think it's it's gonna be weird to come
like<00:05:24.770> two<00:05:25.009> or<00:05:25.159> two<00:05:25.400> or<00:05:25.490> three<00:05:25.550> days<00:05:25.819> from<00:05:26.240> now

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
like two or two or three days from now

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.119 
like two or two or three days from now
when<00:05:26.689> suddenly<00:05:27.050> I<00:05:27.169> realized<00:05:27.680> I<00:05:27.770> don't<00:05:27.919> have<00:05:28.039> to

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:28.129 
when suddenly I realized I don't have to

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:29.790 
when suddenly I realized I don't have to
play<00:05:28.339> a<00:05:28.370> game<00:05:28.580> of<00:05:28.610> chess<00:05:28.909> the<00:05:29.060> following<00:05:29.449> day

play a game of chess the following day

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.320 
play a game of chess the following day
because<00:05:30.800> it's<00:05:30.979> I<00:05:31.310> mean<00:05:31.550> I've<00:05:31.669> had<00:05:31.819> some<00:05:31.879> short

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
because it's I mean I've had some short

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.689 
because it's I mean I've had some short
breaks<00:05:32.599> like<00:05:32.839> four<00:05:33.259> or<00:05:33.379> five<00:05:33.560> days<00:05:33.889> in<00:05:34.400> between

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:34.699 
breaks like four or five days in between

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:36.640 
breaks like four or five days in between
all<00:05:34.819> these<00:05:34.909> tournaments<00:05:35.270> but<00:05:35.599> still<00:05:36.229> you<00:05:36.409> sort

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
all these tournaments but still you sort

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.140 
all these tournaments but still you sort

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
of get used to playing every day and so

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.240 
of get used to playing every day and so

and not play chess
it'll<00:05:42.949> be<00:05:43.069> nice<00:05:43.279> but<00:05:43.580> at<00:05:43.699> first<00:05:43.939> it's<00:05:44.089> gonna<00:05:44.210> be

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
it'll be nice but at first it's gonna be

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.119 
it'll be nice but at first it's gonna be
a<00:05:44.389> little<00:05:44.539> bit<00:05:44.719> weird<00:05:44.930> so<00:05:45.229> I'll<00:05:45.379> probably<00:05:45.770> I'll

00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:46.129 
a little bit weird so I'll probably I'll

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:48.309 
a little bit weird so I'll probably I'll
just<00:05:46.370> be<00:05:46.490> relaxing<00:05:47.029> a<00:05:47.089> bit<00:05:47.270> going<00:05:47.509> on<00:05:47.689> vacation

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:50.509 
and then somewhere around the middle of

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.920 

but<00:05:59.710> actually<00:06:00.550> I<00:06:00.790> wore<00:06:01.090> it<00:06:01.270> and<00:06:01.540> the<00:06:01.750> first

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
but actually I wore it and the first

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.140 
but actually I wore it and the first
games<00:06:02.110> I<00:06:02.230> played<00:06:02.500> in<00:06:02.680> the<00:06:02.800> Olympiad<00:06:03.460> against

Lithuania<00:06:04.270> so<00:06:05.110> I<00:06:05.910> I<00:06:06.910> guess<00:06:07.180> a<00:06:07.390> lot<00:06:07.480> of<00:06:07.570> people

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660

Lithuania so I I guess a lot of people
didn't<00:06:08.020> notice<00:06:08.140> it<00:06:08.320> then<00:06:08.590> but<00:06:08.890> I<00:06:09.250> just<00:06:09.640> felt
