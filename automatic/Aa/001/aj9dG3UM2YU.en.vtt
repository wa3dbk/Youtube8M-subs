00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello and welcome to this news 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.960
 blur video running not yet 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.059
 so today I am with a mehdi 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.809
 baala who is double european champion 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:16.379
 of the 1500 m so also a record on 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:21.570
 1500 m which is in 3 minutes 28 seconds 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:23.550
 and 96 hundredths 98 hundredths per no and 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.590
 during this little interview 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.820
 but he says he 'll give us advice 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.579
 to progress and succeed on the 1500 m 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.410
 so first of all is what you can do 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.390
 briefly introduce that we explain 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.860
 from beginnings to today in the 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.660
 running is so I started to 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.170
 16 years old I started at 16 years old by the 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.519
 cross support his friend 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.739
 we won everything in the categories 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:48.050
 young people made champion of France 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.609
 thirty four times out of four times 1103 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.719
 its price I started to do the 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:51.979
 first year of 800 with a 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.329
 sense I beat my first record of 

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:56.989
 France in cadets in cellar is not long 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:00.340
 after my beginnings I specialized 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.110
 over 15 years with the success that 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.180
 you know the setbacks too because 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.480
 that a career his daughter there is a lot 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.680
 many more things 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.810
 unhappy something pink and 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.600
 it was gone from god here I am two 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.870
 World Champion and Olympic Champion 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.360
 beijing 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:19.420
 if we are still in agreement 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.540
 so what are the workouts 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.420
 to be made to progress at 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.460
 maximum 1500 m I would say it takes 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.990
 do a little bit of everything to invite to 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.580
 know 2 409 these voices there is between 2 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.410
 800 and she is longer distance 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.460
 so finished this time it's been a little bit 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.979
 bastard so inevitably you have to be 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.710
 fast and surroundings you have to make 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.540
 sessions of 800 600 and 800 m it does so 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.759
 the 543 100 me when I was doing this kind 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.899
 of sitting at the time I was doing minutes 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:50.110
 at 547 5 at 400 m and 35 seconds at 300 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.610
 with 6000 recovery and then after 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.610
 a slightly longer session on 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.700
 distances up to 2000 meters in 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.080
 10 sessions 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.750
 is it too powerful 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.100
 teacher or three families or otherwise 6 104 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.680
 102 times we can make players from 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.630
 things r playtime no Recycling is 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.780
 especially the quality 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:13.530
 okay, roughly speaking, 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.540
 pyramid sessions 300 400 500 and a few 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.280
 sessions like three times thousand products 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.660
 without the maximum provincial court 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.940
 know-how of the videographer and they have 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.350
 in fact the goblin is easy and 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.520
 pass just say but it's 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:29.490
 long avoid agreement and the last 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.760
 week before at 1500 meters if the 1500 m 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.970
 takes place on sunday what to do from monday to 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.970
 Sunday 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.770
 me my specific nation that was 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.390
 eight days before so for good times 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.920
 to be able to recover the session but 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.410
 while still looking at a 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.300
 normal training so here we go 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.040
 make the session of the day before and after 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.720
 make sessions a little shorter 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.070
 but in turin with a bit of anti 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.720
 intensity in sessions of four 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.110
 hundred hundred and two hundred what 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.550
 did a lot 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.270
 three days before me it was two 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.240
 mean a little bit more his 124 25 8 times him 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.410
 repetition with very little recovery 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.890
 what I was doing too tight 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.060
 session the day before the race and see the 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.660
 see the morning to do a little bit of 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.500
 overcompensation 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.060
 because a lot of athletes 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.320
 today make the mistake of cutting 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.720
 completely three or four days before 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.170
 it was not my body used to 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.190
 to train to have an intensity 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.250
 drive so you have to stay on 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.430
 this base okay that's what you 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.320
 did a maximum last week 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.780
 before distance to what I was doing rome 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.570
 agree and about the diet 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.570
 is there a diet 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.080
 specific or a food to eat them 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.980
 three last four days of wind 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.500
 after that is the case by case I have 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.330
 tried the social regime for 428 we will say 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.440
 it's weird but it's a spleen 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.040
 nothing but a crazy I tried it worked 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.150
 not bad but me me I ate a 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.860
 little bit everything so what it takes 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.930
 what must be kept in mind 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.970
 is that you're good except that it was 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.980
 I had a diet based 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.440
 of starchy foods two days before very little 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.670
 flea red on the house then 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.100
 on the action on guarantees on 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.820
 white meat 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.610
 which is crazy enough that I 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.980
 ate before the holiday actors mock 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.660
 from them cakes forms again 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.260
 less like the brother marat hold but that 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:16.080
 was fine with me ok and for 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:19.040
 finish on one last question she 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.989
 is the specific warm-up or to do 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.770
 before a competition of a thousand ways 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.820
 or to prepare 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.900
 again I will talk about my 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.920
 nobody since a warm up is 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.930
 still case by case so it takes 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.440
 try to learn from his own 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.850
 resistance 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.720
 me what I did to do what 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.450
 I always did the one to 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.310
 warming up in a classic race 20 25 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.540
 minutes would have a lot of range the 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.820
 tinamis ranges increasingly dynamic 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.160
 on the wines of guard of the race 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.900
 more and faster and lines 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.250
 right it's pushing the key for 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.810
 especially before entering the track 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.940
 straight lines 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:52.410
 the second will need months and it is necessary 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.970
 remember do really really 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.310
 really fast just before you can 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:59.040
 leaving it ensures the start we write 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.860
 to enter directly that okay 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.840
 so if your race at 3 pm to 14 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.780
 hours that starts a little jogging 25 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.550
 minutes then vegan dynamic for 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.430
 finish havas on big 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:14.430
 accelerations just before the command the 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.889
 Corsican just as easy ok anyway 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.720
 thank you for your valuable advice a 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:20.820
 again so if you have any 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.070
 questions said the teeth the 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.020
 comments just below and I 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.810
 will answer without any problem 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.729
