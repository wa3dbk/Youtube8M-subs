00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.810 
nasty but with the proper ingredients
you<00:03:06.290> can<00:03:06.530> use<00:03:06.769> some<00:03:07.040> of<00:03:07.130> that<00:03:07.160> positive

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
you can use some of that positive

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.030 
you can use some of that positive
thinking<00:03:07.970> effectively<00:03:08.720> but<00:03:09.049> by<00:03:09.290> itself<00:03:09.739> it's

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
thinking effectively but by itself it's

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.370 
thinking effectively but by itself it's
like<00:03:10.100> a<00:03:10.459> raw<00:03:10.610> egg<00:03:10.880> it's<00:03:11.690> not<00:03:12.019> going<00:03:12.200> to<00:03:12.260> be

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
like a raw egg it's not going to be

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.890 
like a raw egg it's not going to be
enough<00:03:12.680> and<00:03:12.920> I<00:03:13.489> know<00:03:13.549> that<00:03:14.030> because<00:03:14.239> I<00:03:14.390> work<00:03:14.690> on

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
enough and I know that because I work on

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.110 
enough and I know that because I work on
applying<00:03:15.320> all<00:03:15.590> this<00:03:15.769> stuff<00:03:16.070> and<00:03:16.280> working<00:03:17.000> with

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
applying all this stuff and working with

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.090 
applying all this stuff and working with
myself<00:03:17.360> to<00:03:17.750> grow<00:03:17.900> and<00:03:18.200> improve<00:03:18.260> and<00:03:18.650> I<00:03:18.680> realize

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
myself to grow and improve and I realize

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.890 
myself to grow and improve and I realize
that<00:03:19.370> you<00:03:19.820> know<00:03:19.850> I<00:03:19.940> can<00:03:20.209> sit<00:03:20.420> down<00:03:20.450> all<00:03:20.750> day

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
that you know I can sit down all day

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.330 
that you know I can sit down all day
long<00:03:21.079> and<00:03:21.260> say<00:03:21.380> positive<00:03:21.860> thoughts<00:03:22.100> and

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
long and say positive thoughts and

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.830 
long and say positive thoughts and
that's<00:03:22.700> just<00:03:22.850> not<00:03:23.000> enough<00:03:23.120> and<00:03:23.420> again<00:03:23.540> I'm

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
that's just not enough and again I'm

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.280 
that's just not enough and again I'm
going<00:03:23.989> to<00:03:24.049> prove<00:03:24.320> that<00:03:24.530> with<00:03:24.829> you<00:03:25.040> as<00:03:25.250> well
