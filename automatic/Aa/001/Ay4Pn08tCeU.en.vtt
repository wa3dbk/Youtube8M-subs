next on our list is to check for a power
connection<00:02:46.269> you<00:02:47.049> should<00:02:47.290> see<00:02:47.500> two<00:02:47.709> cables

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
connection you should see two cables

connected to your hard drive the larger

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.050 
connected to your hard drive the larger
connector<00:02:50.530> with<00:02:50.859> multicolored<00:02:51.430> wires<00:02:51.639> is<00:02:51.909> the

connector with multicolored wires is the

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.420 
connector with multicolored wires is the
power<00:02:52.269> cable<00:02:52.569> in<00:02:52.900> our<00:02:53.409> situation<00:02:54.069> this

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
power cable in our situation this

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.709 
power cable in our situation this
computer<00:02:54.849> actually<00:02:55.000> has<00:02:55.269> two<00:02:55.480> power

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:55.719 
computer actually has two power

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:57.539 
computer actually has two power
connectors<00:02:56.260> therefore<00:02:56.980> we<00:02:57.099> don't<00:02:57.250> need<00:02:57.370> to

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
connectors therefore we don't need to

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.550 
connectors therefore we don't need to
worry<00:02:57.700> about<00:02:57.790> adding<00:02:58.269> cables<00:02:58.629> for<00:02:58.780> that<00:02:58.900> if

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
worry about adding cables for that if

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.319 
worry about adding cables for that if
your<00:02:59.799> computer<00:03:00.219> does<00:03:00.400> not<00:03:00.579> already<00:03:00.790> have<00:03:01.000> an

your computer does not already have an
extra<00:03:01.569> power<00:03:01.750> connector<00:03:02.319> don't<00:03:02.709> panic<00:03:02.980> for<00:03:03.609> a

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:03.669 
extra power connector don't panic for a

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:05.159 
extra power connector don't panic for a
few<00:03:03.909> bucks<00:03:04.090> you<00:03:04.239> can<00:03:04.359> easily<00:03:04.719> purchase<00:03:04.930> a

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:05.169 
few bucks you can easily purchase a

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:06.839 
few bucks you can easily purchase a
cable<00:03:05.500> that<00:03:05.590> will<00:03:05.680> take<00:03:05.889> one<00:03:06.129> power<00:03:06.340> connector

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
cable that will take one power connector

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.250 
cable that will take one power connector
and<00:03:07.030> split<00:03:07.569> it<00:03:07.659> into<00:03:07.719> two

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
final item on our checklist do we have a

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.250 
final item on our checklist do we have a
data<00:03:15.879> port<00:03:16.150> on<00:03:16.329> our<00:03:16.449> motherboard<00:03:16.930> that<00:03:16.989> we<00:03:17.109> can

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
data port on our motherboard that we can

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.710 
data port on our motherboard that we can
plug<00:03:17.470> it<00:03:17.590> into<00:03:17.709> the<00:03:18.639> easy<00:03:18.819> way<00:03:19.090> to<00:03:19.150> find<00:03:19.419> out<00:03:19.569> is

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
plug it into the easy way to find out is

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.089 
plug it into the easy way to find out is
to<00:03:19.750> start<00:03:20.109> at<00:03:20.199> the<00:03:20.229> end<00:03:20.379> of<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.560> cable<00:03:20.889> plug

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
to start at the end of the cable plug

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.339 
to start at the end of the cable plug
into<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.459> hard<00:03:21.699> drive<00:03:21.970> and<00:03:22.239> follow<00:03:23.019> it<00:03:23.169> all

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
into the hard drive and follow it all

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:26.750 
into the hard drive and follow it all
the<00:03:23.470> way<00:03:23.590> to<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:23.859> motherboard

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.069 

now<00:03:27.760> you<00:03:27.819> can<00:03:28.090> unplug<00:03:28.299> this<00:03:28.540> into<00:03:28.780> the<00:03:28.870> cable

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
now you can unplug this into the cable

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.110 
now you can unplug this into the cable
and<00:03:29.379> if<00:03:29.650> you<00:03:29.799> want<00:03:30.010> match<00:03:30.220> it<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:30.519> an<00:03:30.609> open<00:03:30.760> port

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
and if you want match it to an open port

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.449 
and if you want match it to an open port
around<00:03:31.389> it<00:03:31.629> almost<00:03:32.470> all<00:03:32.709> systems<00:03:32.949> like<00:03:33.310> this

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
around it almost all systems like this

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.369 
around it almost all systems like this
will<00:03:33.669> have<00:03:33.819> at<00:03:33.970> least<00:03:34.000> one<00:03:34.239> extra<00:03:34.840> set<00:03:35.079> of<00:03:35.199> data

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:35.379 
will have at least one extra set of data

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:38.610 
will have at least one extra set of data
port<00:03:36.780> unfortunately<00:03:37.780> our<00:03:38.019> system<00:03:38.229> does<00:03:38.530> not
