00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
these are different things we could

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.300 
these are different things we could
change<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:11.520> smile<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.450> shape<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:13.530> way<00:01:14.100> the

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
change the smile the shape the way the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.440 
change the smile the shape the way the
eyes<00:01:14.490> look<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.869> shirt<00:01:17.030> shorts<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.150> can<00:01:18.270> see

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
eyes look the shirt shorts you can see

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.300 
eyes look the shirt shorts you can see
here<00:01:18.720> we<00:01:18.869> don't<00:01:19.049> have<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.380> lot<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.799> choose<00:01:20.280> from

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
here we don't have a lot to choose from

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.649 
here we don't have a lot to choose from
at<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.729> beginning<00:01:21.090> that's<00:01:21.240> because<00:01:21.540> we

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
at the beginning that's because we

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.660 
at the beginning that's because we
haven't<00:01:21.900> made<00:01:21.990> any<00:01:22.170> purchases<00:01:22.770> yet<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:23.520> let's

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
haven't made any purchases yet so let's

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.149 
haven't made any purchases yet so let's
go<00:01:23.880> down<00:01:24.090> here<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.630> let's<00:01:24.900> do<00:01:25.140> Madrid<00:01:25.710> because

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
go down here and let's do Madrid because

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.800 
go down here and let's do Madrid because
that's<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.490> highest<00:01:26.670> chance<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.270> winning<00:01:27.630> it

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
that's the highest chance of winning it

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.260 
that's the highest chance of winning it
is<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.229> low<00:01:28.500> payout<00:01:28.770> but<00:01:29.250> that's<00:01:29.460> probably<00:01:30.030> our

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
is a low payout but that's probably our

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.940 
is a low payout but that's probably our
best<00:01:30.600> chance<00:01:30.960> here<00:01:31.259> because<00:01:31.590> we<00:01:31.710> don't<00:01:31.890> have

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
best chance here because we don't have

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.399 
best chance here because we don't have
really<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:33.030> good<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.299> an<00:01:33.540> outfit<00:01:33.930> going<00:01:34.259> on

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
really that good of an outfit going on

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.910 
really that good of an outfit going on
all<00:01:35.220> right<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:36.240> says<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.720> we<00:01:37.710> got<00:01:37.890> a

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
all right so it says that we got a

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.069 
all right so it says that we got a
little<00:01:38.189> bit<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.430> cash<00:01:38.700> here<00:01:39.060> not<00:01:39.329> really<00:01:39.810> too

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
little bit of cash here not really too

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.310 
little bit of cash here not really too
much<00:01:40.460> but<00:01:41.460> we<00:01:41.549> can<00:01:41.729> go<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.450> store<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:43.020> see

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
much but we can go to the store and see

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.200 
much but we can go to the store and see
if<00:01:43.409> there's<00:01:43.590> anything<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.009> we<00:01:44.130> can<00:01:44.310> get<00:01:44.490> so

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
if there's anything that we can get so

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.889
