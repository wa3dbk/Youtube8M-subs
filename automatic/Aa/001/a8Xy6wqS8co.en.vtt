to 12,000 pounds these have huge clits
on<00:00:08.880> them<00:00:09.059> so<00:00:09.510> those<00:00:09.690> horses<00:00:10.139> can<00:00:10.349> get<00:00:10.530> traction

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
on them so those horses can get traction

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.470 
on them so those horses can get traction
and<00:00:11.130> then<00:00:11.280> it<00:00:11.400> digs<00:00:11.759> in<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.030> ground<00:00:12.240> like<00:00:12.420> that

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
and then it digs in the ground like that

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.839 
and then it digs in the ground like that
but<00:00:13.320> Dave's<00:00:13.559> been<00:00:13.740> explained<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.700> procedure

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
but Dave's been explained the procedure

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.230 
but Dave's been explained the procedure
he<00:00:15.450> does<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:16.340> put<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.460> shoe<00:00:17.640> on<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.850> worst

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
he does to put the shoe on the worst

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.420 
he does to put the shoe on the worst
first<00:00:19.050> of<00:00:19.199> all<00:00:19.260> you<00:00:19.320> got<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.710> decide<00:00:19.980> what<00:00:20.220> you

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
first of all you got to decide what you

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.519 
first of all you got to decide what you
you<00:00:20.609> got<00:00:20.640> this<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.359> don't<00:00:22.020> know<00:00:22.109> if<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.260> can<00:00:22.380> see

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
you got this I don't know if you can see

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:23.990 
you got this I don't know if you can see
it<00:00:22.560> but<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.890> toe<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.250> laid<00:00:23.430> out<00:00:23.460> this<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:23.939> the

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
it but the toe is laid out this is the

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.330 
it but the toe is laid out this is the
front<00:00:24.210> shoe<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:25.260> this<00:00:25.410> totals<00:00:25.800> more<00:00:25.980> straight

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
front shoe and this totals more straight

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.210 
front shoe and this totals more straight
down<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.330> back<00:00:27.570> shoot<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:28.220> drive

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
down and this is a back shoot a drive

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.919 
down and this is a back shoot a drive
towards<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.609> pull<00:00:29.789> on<00:00:29.970> his<00:00:30.119> toes<00:00:30.359> in<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.660> front

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
towards to pull on his toes in the front

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.049 
towards to pull on his toes in the front
and<00:00:31.140> in<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.920> back<00:00:32.040> there<00:00:32.369> pull<00:00:32.579> flat-footed

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
and in the back there pull flat-footed

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.000 
and in the back there pull flat-footed
so<00:00:33.540> that's<00:00:33.719> that's<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.469> reason<00:00:34.739> for<00:00:34.920> the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
so that's that's the reason for the

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.440 
so that's that's the reason for the
difference<00:00:35.160> in<00:00:35.489> design<00:00:35.790> because<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.239> prep

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
difference in design because the prep

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.290 
difference in design because the prep
foot<00:00:36.690> goes<00:00:36.960> like<00:00:37.260> this<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.739> back<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.129> flat

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
foot goes like this and the back is flat

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.930 
foot goes like this and the back is flat
that's<00:00:39.300> interesting<00:00:40.050> on<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.620> draft<00:00:40.890> horse<00:00:41.070> the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
that's interesting on a draft horse the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.760 
that's interesting on a draft horse the
biggest<00:00:42.149> problem<00:00:42.329> with<00:00:42.719> these<00:00:42.870> things<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.710> you

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
biggest problem with these things is you

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.950 
biggest problem with these things is you
hurt<00:00:44.129> their<00:00:44.340> tendons<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.210> front<00:00:45.480> tendons<00:00:45.870> and

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
the hills and lower the toe and they'll

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.469 
the hills and lower the toe and they'll
take<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.159> shorter<00:01:05.580> stride<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:06.030> don't<00:01:06.210> want<00:01:06.390> to

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
take a shorter stride you don't want to

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.560 
take a shorter stride you don't want to
drive<00:01:06.630> towards<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.140> over<00:01:07.350> stride<00:01:08.299> too<00:01:09.299> far

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
drive towards to over stride too far

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.660 
drive towards to over stride too far
because<00:01:09.720> they<00:01:10.380> can't<00:01:10.650> its<00:01:10.890> pitch<00:01:11.130> momentum

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
because they can't its pitch momentum

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.250 
because they can't its pitch momentum
they<00:01:11.939> can't<00:01:12.180> keep<00:01:12.390> their<00:01:12.450> momentum<00:01:12.869> if<00:01:13.110> you'll

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
they can't keep their momentum if you'll

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.380 
they can't keep their momentum if you'll
take<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.439> short<00:01:13.770> stroke<00:01:14.130> they<00:01:14.909> got<00:01:15.090> they<00:01:15.240> have

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
take a short stroke they got they have

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.800 
take a short stroke they got they have
more<00:01:15.540> power<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:16.200> noticed<00:01:17.159> today<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.520> Dave<00:01:18.240> did

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
more power I noticed today that Dave did

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.050

Florida<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.790> we<00:02:39.510> did<00:02:39.750> have<00:02:39.989> a<00:02:40.019> problem<00:02:40.680> with<00:02:40.890> I

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
Florida and we did have a problem with I

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.009 
Florida and we did have a problem with I
think<00:02:41.640> it<00:02:41.700> was<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.849> raccoon<00:02:42.120> trying<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:42.840> dig

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
think it was a raccoon trying to dig

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.229 
think it was a raccoon trying to dig
under<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.440> fence<00:02:43.650> but<00:02:44.489> how<00:02:44.640> we<00:02:44.700> solve<00:02:45.060> that

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
under the fence but how we solve that

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.960 
under the fence but how we solve that
problem<00:02:45.569> was<00:02:45.810> really<00:02:46.319> easy<00:02:46.560> we<00:02:47.430> cut<00:02:47.730> like<00:02:47.940> a

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
problem was really easy we cut like a

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.229 
problem was really easy we cut like a
one<00:02:48.299> foot<00:02:48.660> piece<00:02:49.440> of<00:02:49.650> wire<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.760> wall<00:02:51.060> of

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
one foot piece of wire and the wall of

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.059 
one foot piece of wire and the wall of
the<00:02:51.329> chicken<00:02:51.660> coop<00:02:51.870> came<00:02:52.140> down<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:52.739> we<00:02:52.829> just

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
the chicken coop came down and we just

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.759 
the chicken coop came down and we just
simply<00:02:53.430> attached<00:02:53.819> that<00:02:54.349> flat<00:02:55.349> on<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.739> ground

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
simply attached that flat on the ground

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.210 
simply attached that flat on the ground
to<00:02:56.579> the<00:02:56.610> PVC<00:02:57.360> pipe<00:02:57.599> so<00:02:58.319> the<00:02:58.470> predator<00:02:58.890> would<00:02:59.040> be

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
to the PVC pipe so the predator would be

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.759 
to the PVC pipe so the predator would be
standing<00:02:59.970> on<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.450> wire<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:01.079> couldn't<00:03:01.440> dig

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
standing on the wire and couldn't dig

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.530 
standing on the wire and couldn't dig
and<00:03:02.099> they<00:03:02.160> weren't<00:03:02.370> smart<00:03:02.700> enough<00:03:02.849> to<00:03:03.209> lift<00:03:03.390> it

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
and they weren't smart enough to lift it

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.449 
and they weren't smart enough to lift it
up<00:03:03.630> with<00:03:03.810> their<00:03:03.989> nose<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.680> get<00:03:04.950> under<00:03:05.220> it<00:03:05.250> and

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
up with their nose and get under it and

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.550 
up with their nose and get under it and
a<00:03:05.670> so<00:03:06.209> that<00:03:06.360> works<00:03:06.540> out<00:03:06.660> perfectly<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:07.200> it<00:03:07.440> was

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
a so that works out perfectly and it was

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.059 
a so that works out perfectly and it was
an<00:03:07.680> easy<00:03:07.799> fix<00:03:08.540> thanks<00:03:09.540> Todd<00:03:09.780> this<00:03:10.530> next<00:03:10.829> letter
