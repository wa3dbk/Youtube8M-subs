00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.300 

something<00:03:40.480> like<00:03:40.629> this<00:03:40.810> happens<00:03:41.200> to<00:03:41.379> one

something like this happens to one

something like this happens to one
this<00:03:43.670> is<00:03:43.790> a<00:03:43.850> high<00:03:44.030> fire<00:03:44.330> risk<00:03:44.569> especially<00:03:45.290> in

the<00:03:45.410> springtime<00:03:45.709> just<00:03:46.190> having<00:03:47.150> a<00:03:47.240> state<00:03:47.450> of

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
the springtime just having a state of

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.510 
the springtime just having a state of
station<00:03:48.470> out<00:03:48.560> like<00:03:48.830> this<00:03:49.010> what<00:03:49.220> kind<00:03:49.430> of

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
station out like this what kind of

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.040 
station out like this what kind of
impact<00:03:49.850> will<00:03:49.970> that<00:03:50.000> have<00:03:50.120> as<00:03:50.720> far<00:03:50.900> as

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
impact will that have as far as

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.620 
impact will that have as far as
addressing<00:03:51.980> any<00:03:52.220> serious<00:03:52.910> fire<00:03:53.090> need<00:03:53.330> for<00:03:53.540> the

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
addressing any serious fire need for the

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.230 
addressing any serious fire need for the
next<00:03:53.840> spring<00:03:54.200> I<00:03:54.620> would<00:03:55.310> estimate<00:03:55.459> by<00:03:55.970> next

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:56.240 
next spring I would estimate by next

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.300 
next spring I would estimate by next
spring<00:03:56.300> air<00:03:56.630> back<00:03:56.690> in<00:03:57.110> operation<00:03:57.290> I<00:03:57.920> would

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
spring air back in operation I would

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.570 
spring air back in operation I would
guess

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.910 

obviously<00:04:03.450> will<00:04:03.600> not<00:04:03.630> have<00:04:03.990> the<00:04:04.140> facility<00:04:04.710> but

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
obviously will not have the facility but

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.800 
obviously will not have the facility but
I<00:04:05.220> quite<00:04:05.820> confident

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
I quite confident

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.650 
I quite confident
while<00:04:07.380> breached
