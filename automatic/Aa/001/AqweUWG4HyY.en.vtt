00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
hollowness inside so that probably took

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.740 
hollowness inside so that probably took

something<00:03:59.670> and<00:03:59.970> then<00:04:00.450> the<00:04:00.600> the<00:04:01.140> other<00:04:01.230> locker

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
something and then the the other locker

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.310 
something and then the the other locker
room<00:04:01.770> is<00:04:01.890> exactly<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.430> same<00:04:03.020> now<00:04:04.020> the<00:04:04.080> only

room is exactly the same now the only

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.460 
room is exactly the same now the only
problem<00:04:04.410> with<00:04:04.800> this<00:04:04.920> that<00:04:05.310> we've<00:04:05.490> noticed<00:04:06.000> is

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
problem with this that we've noticed is

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.080 
problem with this that we've noticed is
you<00:04:07.470> can<00:04:07.740> like<00:04:08.370> when<00:04:08.550> you<00:04:08.610> shoot<00:04:08.820> your<00:04:08.910> goal

you can like when you shoot your goal

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.940 
you can like when you shoot your goal
this<00:04:09.270> lights<00:04:09.510> up<00:04:09.690> so<00:04:10.230> whenever<00:04:10.530> I<00:04:10.650> have<00:04:10.800> my

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
this lights up so whenever I have my

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
if you keep these platforms here and

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.770 
if you keep these platforms here and
you're<00:04:19.380> not<00:04:19.500> like<00:04:19.769> a<00:04:19.799> server<00:04:20.220> admin<00:04:20.730> like<00:04:21.480> you

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
you're not like a server admin like you

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.400 
you're not like a server admin like you
can't<00:04:22.079> get<00:04:22.230> the<00:04:22.410> item<00:04:22.620> back<00:04:22.770> so<00:04:23.010> I<00:04:23.280> always<00:04:23.580> do

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
can't get the item back so I always do

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.100 
can't get the item back so I always do
remove<00:04:25.410> items<00:04:26.419> and<00:04:27.419> that'll<00:04:27.660> get<00:04:27.780> rid<00:04:27.810> of<00:04:27.990> it

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
remove items and that'll get rid of it

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.590 
remove items and that'll get rid of it
but<00:04:28.800> if<00:04:28.919> you're<00:04:29.040> not<00:04:29.130> a<00:04:29.160> server<00:04:29.430> admin<00:04:29.850> like

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
but if you're not a server admin like

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.060 
but if you're not a server admin like
you're<00:04:30.810> just<00:04:30.990> a<00:04:31.050> normal<00:04:31.260> person<00:04:31.710> that<00:04:31.890> will

stand on the past then go for it awesome
okay<00:04:55.590> another<00:04:55.770> thing<00:04:55.890> is<00:04:56.250> the<00:04:56.750> scoreboard<00:04:58.460> we

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
okay another thing is the scoreboard we

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.480 
okay another thing is the scoreboard we
are<00:04:59.669> not<00:04:59.940> redstone<00:05:00.930> people<00:05:01.590> like<00:05:02.040> at<00:05:02.340> least

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
are not redstone people like at least

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.460 
are not redstone people like at least
not<00:05:02.760> very<00:05:02.790> good<00:05:03.270> anyways<00:05:03.630> we<00:05:03.810> got<00:05:03.840> the<00:05:04.110> basics

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
not very good anyways we got the basics

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.070 
not very good anyways we got the basics
down<00:05:04.620> but<00:05:05.390> the<00:05:06.390> only<00:05:06.540> way<00:05:06.660> to<00:05:06.720> change<00:05:06.930> the

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
down but the only way to change the

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.219 
down but the only way to change the
board<00:05:07.350> like<00:05:07.979> the<00:05:08.100> score<00:05:08.370> is<00:05:08.840> just<00:05:09.840> on<00:05:09.960> your<00:05:10.080> own

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
board like the score is just on your own

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:12.110 
board like the score is just on your own
so<00:05:10.470> when<00:05:11.010> we<00:05:11.130> play<00:05:11.340> we<00:05:11.520> always<00:05:11.700> have<00:05:11.880> one

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
so when we play we always have one

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.390 
so when we play we always have one
having<00:05:12.419> dedicated<00:05:12.630> to<00:05:13.080> the<00:05:13.380> server<00:05:13.680> I<00:05:14.040> mean

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
having dedicated to the server I mean

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.120 
having dedicated to the server I mean
that<00:05:14.550> like<00:05:14.729> the<00:05:14.940> scoreboard<00:05:15.419> here<00:05:15.479> and<00:05:15.810> if<00:05:16.740> you

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
that like the scoreboard here and if you

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.370 
that like the scoreboard here and if you
like<00:05:17.340> we<00:05:17.700> put<00:05:18.000> the<00:05:18.150> numbers<00:05:18.510> off<00:05:18.780> to<00:05:19.050> the<00:05:19.169> side

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
like we put the numbers off to the side

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.560 
like we put the numbers off to the side
so<00:05:19.950> you<00:05:20.010> can<00:05:20.070> copy<00:05:20.400> paste<00:05:20.700> them<00:05:20.850> in<00:05:20.970> if<00:05:21.090> if<00:05:21.270> you

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
so you can copy paste them in if if you

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.240 
so you can copy paste them in if if you
want<00:05:21.810> it's<00:05:22.050> easy<00:05:22.260> enough<00:05:22.380> it's<00:05:22.740> like<00:05:22.890> the<00:05:23.040> same
