stockpiled medications a lot of people

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.010 
stockpiled medications a lot of people
with<00:04:30.180> chronic<00:04:31.400> health<00:04:32.400> issues<00:04:32.750> want<00:04:33.750> to<00:04:33.900> know

how can I stock up on things like

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.839 
how can I stock up on things like
insulin<00:04:36.840> or<00:04:37.050> whatever<00:04:37.800> medication<00:04:38.460> they

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:38.849 
insulin or whatever medication they

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:41.450 
insulin or whatever medication they
happen<00:04:39.150> to<00:04:39.180> be<00:04:39.270> on<00:04:39.539> and<00:04:40.070> Joe<00:04:41.070> lets<00:04:41.310> us<00:04:41.430> know

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
happen to be on and Joe lets us know

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.909 
happen to be on and Joe lets us know
just<00:04:41.970> straight<00:04:42.270> up<00:04:42.300> and<00:04:42.690> a<00:04:42.810> me<00:04:42.870> too<00:04:43.080> they<00:04:43.710> let

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
just straight up and a me too they let

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.830 
just straight up and a me too they let
us<00:04:43.950> know<00:04:44.099> straight<00:04:44.580> up<00:04:44.610> that<00:04:45.060> most

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
us know straight up that most

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.310 
us know straight up that most
medications<00:04:46.380> in<00:04:46.710> pill<00:04:46.919> form<00:04:46.950> are<00:04:47.840> potent<00:04:48.840> for

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
medications in pill form are potent for

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.529 
medications in pill form are potent for
years<00:04:49.590> after<00:04:50.010> that<00:04:50.039> marked<00:04:50.520> expiration<00:04:51.330> date

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:51.539 
years after that marked expiration date

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:54.350 
years after that marked expiration date
and<00:04:51.780> so<00:04:52.530> I<00:04:52.800> think<00:04:53.159> the<00:04:53.490> book<00:04:53.640> is<00:04:53.880> a<00:04:54.180> good

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
and so I think the book is a good

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.580 
and so I think the book is a good
investment<00:04:54.479> I<00:04:54.870> think<00:04:55.080> it's<00:04:55.169> a<00:04:55.229> good<00:04:55.349> addition

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
investment I think it's a good addition

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.029 
investment I think it's a good addition
to<00:04:55.919> a<00:04:55.950> survival<00:04:56.849> library<00:04:57.840> and<00:04:58.140> here<00:04:58.710> is<00:04:58.860> one

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 
to a survival library and here is one

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:01.219 
to a survival library and here is one
thing<00:04:59.280> that<00:04:59.310> I<00:04:59.430> would<00:04:59.520> say<00:04:59.700> though<00:05:00.120> it<00:05:00.390> is<00:05:00.960> not

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
thing that I would say though it is not

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:03.200 
thing that I would say though it is not
the<00:05:01.409> kind<00:05:01.620> of<00:05:01.710> book<00:05:01.890> that<00:05:02.250> you<00:05:02.460> can<00:05:02.669> just<00:05:02.880> grab

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
the kind of book that you can just grab

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.950 
the kind of book that you can just grab
in<00:05:03.720> the<00:05:04.229> middle<00:05:04.289> of<00:05:04.500> a<00:05:04.590> crisis<00:05:05.190> and<00:05:05.840> you<00:05:06.840> know
