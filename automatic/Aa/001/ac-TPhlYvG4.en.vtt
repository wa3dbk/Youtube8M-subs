and this is very good has a very high
stability<00:01:23.369> which<00:01:23.850> means<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.210> little<00:01:24.570> fire<00:01:24.780> rate

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049

as much damage as the hawk moon actually
but<00:03:55.000> there<00:03:55.150> is<00:03:55.240> why<00:03:55.390> this<00:03:55.450> is<00:03:55.660> number<00:03:55.780> two<00:03:56.050> is

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
but there is why this is number two is

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.170 
but there is why this is number two is
because<00:03:56.320> it<00:03:56.440> has<00:03:56.560> a<00:03:56.590> special<00:03:57.130> perk<00:03:57.400> called<00:03:58.000> the

because it has a special perk called the

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.660 
because it has a special perk called the

mark of the Devourer now what the market

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.220 
mark of the Devourer now what the market
of<00:04:00.760> our<00:04:00.910> does<00:04:01.180> is<00:04:01.330> every<00:04:01.600> time<00:04:01.780> you<00:04:01.930> shoot<00:04:02.080> an

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
of our does is every time you shoot an

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.890 
of our does is every time you shoot an
enemy<00:04:02.590> that<00:04:02.830> shot<00:04:03.370> will<00:04:03.580> continue<00:04:04.060> sleep<00:04:04.420> do

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
enemy that shot will continue sleep do

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.290 
enemy that shot will continue sleep do
damage<00:04:05.380> to<00:04:05.620> the<00:04:06.010> person<00:04:06.370> you<00:04:06.430> shot<00:04:06.700> and<00:04:06.940> it

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
damage to the person you shot and it

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.180 
damage to the person you shot and it
will<00:04:07.420> actually<00:04:07.570> it's<00:04:07.990> it'll<00:04:08.560> actually<00:04:08.680> burn

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
will actually it's it'll actually burn

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.580 
will actually it's it'll actually burn
quote-unquote<00:04:09.880> burn<00:04:10.150> them<00:04:10.450> and<00:04:10.750> it'll<00:04:11.470> do

quote-unquote burn them and it'll do

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.230 
quote-unquote burn them and it'll do
damage<00:04:11.920> overall<00:04:12.340> which<00:04:12.459> I<00:04:12.580> think<00:04:12.880> this<00:04:13.030> is<00:04:13.209> a

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.240 
damage overall which I think this is a

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.630 
damage overall which I think this is a
huge<00:04:13.720> plus<00:04:14.020> when<00:04:14.620> you're<00:04:14.770> going<00:04:15.100> in<00:04:15.250> like<00:04:15.459> a

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
huge plus when you're going in like a

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.520 
huge plus when you're going in like a
skirmish<00:04:16.299> or<00:04:16.480> if<00:04:16.660> you're<00:04:16.810> playing<00:04:17.019> the<00:04:17.350> iron

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.340 
skirmish or if you're playing the iron
banner<00:04:17.859> or<00:04:18.280> even<00:04:18.760> the<00:04:18.940> trials<00:04:19.269> of<00:04:19.299> Osiris<00:04:19.840> now

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
banner or even the trials of Osiris now

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.080 
banner or even the trials of Osiris now
if<00:04:21.040> you<00:04:21.190> shoot<00:04:21.400> someone<00:04:21.670> if<00:04:21.850> they're<00:04:21.940> going

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
if you shoot someone if they're going

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.550 
if you shoot someone if they're going
around<00:04:22.240> a<00:04:22.330> corner<00:04:22.540> you<00:04:22.840> always<00:04:23.110> have<00:04:23.230> to<00:04:23.350> chase

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
around a corner you always have to chase

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.900 
around a corner you always have to chase
them<00:04:23.770> down<00:04:23.800> but<00:04:24.430> with<00:04:24.520> the<00:04:24.610> mark<00:04:24.790> of<00:04:24.880> the

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
them down but with the mark of the

Devourer perk you can shoot someone that

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.810 
Devourer perk you can shoot someone that
could<00:04:26.470> run<00:04:26.530> on<00:04:26.650> the<00:04:26.740> corner<00:04:27.100> and<00:04:27.220> if<00:04:27.640> they're

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
could run on the corner and if they're

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.280 
could run on the corner and if they're
close<00:04:28.030> enough<00:04:28.150> to<00:04:28.480> dine<00:04:28.690> you<00:04:28.720> could<00:04:29.110> finish

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
close enough to dine you could finish

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.720 
close enough to dine you could finish
them<00:04:29.530> off<00:04:29.650> without<00:04:29.830> even<00:04:30.040> having<00:04:30.340> to<00:04:30.520> chase

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
them off without even having to chase

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.550 
them off without even having to chase
after<00:04:30.940> them<00:04:31.180> which<00:04:31.630> I<00:04:31.780> think<00:04:32.020> that<00:04:32.140> makes<00:04:32.350> this
