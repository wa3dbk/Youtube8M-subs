right<00:02:30.880> but<00:02:31.090> you're<00:02:31.239> not<00:02:31.299> looking<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:31.720> score

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
right but you're not looking to score

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.039 
right but you're not looking to score
your<00:02:32.110> runs<00:02:32.319> there<00:02:32.590> are<00:02:32.769> you<00:02:32.920> and<00:02:33.250> a<00:02:33.430> bit<00:02:33.970> bit<00:02:34.959> on

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
your runs there are you and a bit bit on

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:37.710 
your runs there are you and a bit bit on
the<00:02:35.170> dead<00:02:35.350> side<00:02:35.590> but<00:02:35.799> again<00:02:36.100> you<00:02:36.940> can<00:02:37.150> see<00:02:37.180> how

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
the dead side but again you can see how

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.080 
the dead side but again you can see how
it<00:02:37.930> fades<00:02:38.620> away<00:02:38.799> there<00:02:39.220> with<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.910> meat

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
it fades away there with the the meat

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.699 
it fades away there with the the meat
down<00:02:40.269> the<00:02:40.450> bottom<00:02:40.720> so<00:02:40.870> it's<00:02:41.019> not<00:02:41.110> to<00:02:41.350> bottom

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
down the bottom so it's not to bottom

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.380 
down the bottom so it's not to bottom
heavy<00:02:41.890> probably<00:02:42.790> picks<00:02:43.030> up<00:02:43.209> enormous

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
imbalance for that particular reason

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.979 
imbalance for that particular reason
there's<00:02:45.730> a<00:02:45.790> bit<00:02:45.910> of<00:02:46.030> weight<00:02:46.150> on<00:02:46.360> this<00:02:46.420> one<00:02:46.840> I'd

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
there's a bit of weight on this one I'd

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.220 
there's a bit of weight on this one I'd
probably<00:02:47.230> say<00:02:47.650> around<00:02:47.860> the<00:02:47.980> 210<00:02:48.580> mark<00:02:49.230> which

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
probably say around the 210 mark which

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.520 
probably say around the 210 mark which
is<00:02:50.260> sort<00:02:50.650> of<00:02:50.739> medium<00:02:51.250> to<00:02:51.430> heavy<00:02:52.019> but<00:02:53.019> I<00:02:53.200> would

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
is sort of medium to heavy but I would

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.560 
is sort of medium to heavy but I would
suggest<00:02:53.739> that<00:02:54.010> these<00:02:54.160> probably<00:02:54.640> range<00:02:55.060> from<00:02:55.450> a

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
suggest that these probably range from a

suggest that these probably range from a
