00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:18.900
 in Spain, 300,000 are abandoned every year 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.910
 animals for dogs the times of 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.160
 greater abandonment are those that coincide with 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.050
 the beginning and the end of the hunt and about 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.990
 everything when the holidays of 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.970
 Summer fortunately in Spain too 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.160
 we have shelters shelters and protectors 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.200
 who take care of these animals today 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.130
 We are in the municipality of Guadarrama in 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.130
 the protective Phoenix is 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.160
 that's how the protectors work but what 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.640
 difference there is between a protective and 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.640
 a kennel 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.490
 protective we bet for the sacrifice 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.490
 zero and the kennels contemplate the 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.960
 sacrifice these figures place Spain 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.150
 among the countries of europe with greater 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.130
 animal abandonment rate but there's always 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.380
 people willing to provide them with 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.270
 second chance the protective 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.280
 also collaborates with the foundation 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.290
 apascovi through which is here and 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.909
 ainhoa ​​ainhoa ​​what is its role in the 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:16.950
 protective 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:20.399
 There is an energy to collect 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.860
 in a round with the normal brothers 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.899
 tells us laura a worker of the 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.740
 protective what this agreement consists of 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:30.179
 initially as good guys 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.789

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:34.380
 for animals to bring here 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.360
 can be trained with us that 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.569
 learn how a center works 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.390
 animal protection and in the future

 one of the adopters of the protective 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:48.509
 Monica because you decided to adopt 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.770
 instead of buying an animal because with 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.959
 all the animals that are in the 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.490
 kennels that all every year 

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:55.170
 thousands and thousands and thousands of 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.319
 animals and you have to rescue them and 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.039
 save them and then what to buy and 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:03.810
 add more dogs not because at the end of 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:05.729

 buy them end up in the kennels in the 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.039
 careers in the protectors and do not give 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.560
 supply 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.450
 most protectors have a 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.090
 web page where the photos of their 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.920
 tenants in adoption are also 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.390

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.610

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.860
