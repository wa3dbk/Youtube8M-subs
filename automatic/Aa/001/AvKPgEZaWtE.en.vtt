fortunate to be done we kicked around

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.140 
fortunate to be done we kicked around
some<00:01:45.140> ideas<00:01:45.260> early<00:01:45.920> on<00:01:46.040> when<00:01:46.490> it<00:01:46.880> was<00:01:46.970> still<00:01:47.090> in

some ideas early on when it was still in

some ideas early on when it was still in
production<00:01:47.390> where<00:01:47.780> we<00:01:47.930> might<00:01:48.320> want<00:01:48.530> to<00:01:48.619> go<00:01:48.740> and

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
production where we might want to go and

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.320 
production where we might want to go and
since<00:01:49.220> my<00:01:49.369> office<00:01:49.700> was<00:01:49.880> involved<00:01:50.240> we

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
since my office was involved we

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.760 
since my office was involved we
definitely<00:01:50.690> wanted<00:01:50.930> an<00:01:51.110> archaeological

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
definitely wanted an archaeological

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.040 
definitely wanted an archaeological
topic<00:01:52.300> and<00:01:53.300> then<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.509> Museum<00:01:53.869> of<00:01:53.899> Natural

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.749 
topic and then the Museum of Natural
History<00:01:54.290> and<00:01:54.680> the<00:01:55.160> old<00:01:55.310> capital<00:01:55.700> museum

on<00:01:58.009> campus<00:01:58.330> so<00:01:59.330> we<00:01:59.360> felt<00:01:59.630> like<00:01:59.750> each<00:01:59.930> unit

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
on campus so we felt like each unit

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.310 
on campus so we felt like each unit
should<00:02:01.100> have<00:02:01.369> an<00:02:02.180> initial<00:02:02.420> exhibit<00:02:03.020> since<00:02:03.200> we

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
then there was a design firm here in

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.470 
then there was a design firm here in
Iowa<00:03:08.250> City<00:03:08.370> as<00:03:08.520> well<00:03:08.580> help<00:03:08.910> with<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.150> exterior

too to make it four islands the asset
that<00:03:16.680> we<00:03:16.980> have<00:03:17.250> an<00:03:17.550> Iowa<00:03:18.000> as<00:03:18.180> we<00:03:18.420> do<00:03:18.540> in<00:03:18.720> any

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
that we have an Iowa as we do in any

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.590 
that we have an Iowa as we do in any
state<00:03:19.260> is<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.980> next<00:03:20.310> generation<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:21.180> so

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
state is the next generation and so

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.200 
state is the next generation and so
inspiring<00:03:22.380> excitement<00:03:23.220> about<00:03:23.400> stem<00:03:23.760> about

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
inspiring excitement about stem about

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.850 
inspiring excitement about stem about
science<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:25.020> technology<00:03:25.650> and<00:03:25.740> engineering

science and technology and engineering

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.920 
science and technology and engineering
and<00:03:26.370> mathematics<00:03:26.520> that's<00:03:27.480> one<00:03:27.750> of<00:03:27.870> the

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
and mathematics that's one of the

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.930 
and mathematics that's one of the
reasons<00:03:28.320> we<00:03:28.560> want<00:03:28.710> to<00:03:28.800> take<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.550> research

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
reasons we want to take the research

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.870 
reasons we want to take the research
from<00:03:30.270> the<00:03:30.300> University<00:03:30.360> of<00:03:30.840> Iowa<00:03:31.230> out<00:03:31.610> to<00:03:32.610> small

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
from the University of Iowa out to small

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.760 
from the University of Iowa out to small
towns<00:03:33.090> and<00:03:33.330> the<00:03:33.690> larger<00:03:34.050> cities<00:03:34.350> across<00:03:34.650> the

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
towns and the larger cities across the

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.430 
towns and the larger cities across the
state<00:03:35.190> to<00:03:35.430> expose<00:03:35.820> them<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.390> what<00:03:36.960> really

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
state to expose them to what really

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.230 
state to expose them to what really
exciting<00:03:37.980> research<00:03:38.130> is<00:03:38.490> taking<00:03:38.820> place<00:03:38.970> and

exciting research is taking place and
give<00:03:39.840> students<00:03:40.350> a<00:03:40.590> sense<00:03:41.070> that<00:03:41.370> that<00:03:41.790> could<00:03:42.000> be

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
give students a sense that that could be

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.140 
give students a sense that that could be
them<00:03:42.390> in<00:03:42.600> their<00:03:42.900> future
